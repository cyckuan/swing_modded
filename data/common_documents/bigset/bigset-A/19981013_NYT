 NOT JUST ANOTHER OPENING FOR DISPUTED MCNALLY PLAY 
 (l) 
 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ More than the usual opening-night aticipation
surrounds Tuesday evening's performance of ``Corpus Christi,''
Terrence McNally's play about a gay Christ-like character and his
gay apostles. Dueling protesters have announced plans to
demonstrate in front of the City Center: those who oppose the
production on religious grounds and those who support it based on
free expression.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, which
describes itself as the nation's largest Roman Catholic civil
rights group, organized the demonstration against the play. William
Donohue, the league's president, said he expected several thousand
protesters from various religious groups to show up near the
theater, which is on West 55th Street between Avenue of the
Americas and Seventh Avenue, in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a play which is replete with vulgarities, with
obscenities directed toward a world religion, I think that has to
be regarded as hate speech,'' said Donohue, who saw a preview
performance on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   But not all the protesters will be against the performance.
Barbara Handman, vice president and New York director of People for
the American Way, said about 200 people were expected to join a
silent march organized by her group, which focuses on civil
liberties. Their demonstration is scheduled to begin at 5 p.m. on
55th Street at Seventh Avenue and to continue until curtain time at
8.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope that people recognize that the First Amendment
gives us the opportunity to have so much expression that we can
have this play and we can also have the protest for this play,''
Ms. Handman said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued on Monday, Lynne Meadow, the artistic
director of The Manhattan Theater Club, and Barry Grove, the
executive producer, said the theater ``understands that some people
have disagreed with the content of McNally's play, and firmly
supports and respects the public's right to express their
opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement added, ``Tonight's demonstration is a reflection
of the supreme importance of First Amendment rights, both for
artists and for the public.''
</P>
<P>
   McNally, the playwright, declined through a spokesman to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over ``Corpus Christi'' _ which follows the
contemporary Joshua from Corpus Christi, Tex., to Jerusalem _ began
to heat up in May, when theater officials received anonymous death
threats after details of the play's content became public. Early
accounts said the play featured a gay, Christ-like figure who had
sex with his apostles, although the version that has been performed
in previews includes only sensual kissing between Joshua, the
Jesus-like character, and Judas.
</P>
<P>
   When the protests began, the Manhattan Theater Club announced
that it would not produce the play, then reversed itself after an
outcry from artists and civil liberties organizations.
</P>
<P>
   To provide security for its audiences, the Manhattan Theater
Club has enlisted the help of Kroll Associates, a private
investigation and security company, as well as the New York Police
Department. People attending performances of the play, which began
previews on Sept. 22, will be required to pass through a metal
detector.
</P>
<P>
   At the first preview performance, about 200 protesters held a
prayer vigil outside City Center and theatergoers were handed
leaflets asking them to walk out of the play if they heard or saw
anything abusive to ``the sacred values of your neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   The play is to run through Nov. 30.

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Japanese real estate giants, caught in the global
credit crunch, are unloading marquee Los Angeles-area holdings at
significant discounts, real estate experts said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest example, Tokyo-based Shuwa Corp. is expected to
ask more than $2 billion but accept much less for its portfolio of
U.S. properties, including Arco Plaza in downtown Los Angeles, two
Century City office buildings and a high-profile office tower in
Glendale, nine miles north of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 sell-offs continue five years of steady liquidation
from Japanese players who amassed $77 billion in American real
estate assets. During the portfolio buildup, Asians bagged trophy
properties such as the Hotel Bel-Air and New York's Rockefeller
Center.
</P>
<P>
   But now Japanese banks and corporations that bought at the peak
of the market in the late 1980s are being forced to sell at prices
falling as far as 50 percent below what they paid. U.S. property
values gained back some of their value after the recession, but
this year's worldwide economic slowdown halted that trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that Shuwa is going to get a lower price than they
would have before the market disruption,'' said Stan Ross, vice
chairman and managing partner of E&AMP;Y Kenneth Leventhal, a leading
tracker of Japanese real estate investment. ``Around the country,
you're seeing discounts of 5 and 10 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1993 and 1997, Japanese owners were forced to unload $26
billion of U.S. holdings at a loss of $10 billion, Ross estimated.
When will the discounting stop? ``That's anybody's guess because
the market has been so disrupted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for prime U.S. office properties, which had recovered
since the recession of the early 1990s, have dropped in recent
months because of declines in the stock market and the perception
that real estate investment trusts bid prices up to unrealistic
levels in the last 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   That means buyers are likely to be opportunistic groups, looking
for bargains, rather than the pension funds and endowments that
traditionally invest in top-line commercial real estate, Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing is unfortunate for Shuwa,'' said Grubb &AMP; Ellis
broker William Boyd. ``If they had put the portfolio up for sale a
year ago, they would have received higher offers than they're
getting now. The current crisis has only served to accelerate that
trend.''
</P>
<P>
   E&AMP;Y Kenneth Leventhal's Jack Rodman, managing partner of the
firm's Asian real estate operations, began advising Japanese
clients 18 months ago to sell U.S. holdings to real estate
investment trusts. He said he was largely ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``My view is that the Japanese missed a window of opportunity to
cash out,'' Rodman said. ``Their timing continues to be poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyd noted Shuwa paid $250 per square foot for the Glendale
property in 1988, a year after it was built by Reliance
Development. ``They bought at the height of the market, and it now
is most likely worth $210 a square foot,'' he said. ``It's kind of
a double whammy for them since the highest payers for those kind of
buildings may have retreated.''
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo-based Shuwa recently put its portfolio up for bid through
Eastdil Realty. The centerpiece of Shuwa's holdings is the 52-story
Arco twin towers, opened in 1972 with more than 2 million square
feet of office space and purchased in the late '80s by Shuwa for
$600 million.
</P>
<P>
   The vacancy rate in the building is now higher than 29 percent,
but economist Jack Kyser, who works in the building at the offices
of the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp., said the towers
remain an attractive site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The property has aged pretty well, and it has a certain cachet
because of its unique character,'' he said. ``A buyer would be
betting on the future economic health of Southern California and
making a bit of a bet on the future of downtown. The key thing is
that downtown is the center of the freeway and rail mass transit
systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Shuwa properties include two other downtown buildings _ the Gas
Co. building and the Chase Plaza _ as well as Taco Bell's corporate
headquarters in Irvine in neighboring Orange County and a pair of
Century City office structures. Kyser said there once was an
entitlement, since expired, for an 84-story structure on the Gas
Co. property.
</P>
<P>
   ``That entitlement was from back in the days when downtown L.A.
was the promised land,'' Kyser said.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Toronto-based real estate giant TrizecHahn Corp. reportedly has
bid $1.8 billion for the Shuwa portfolio. TrizecHahn, which
recently broke ground on a $380 million entertainment complex on
Hollywood Boulevard, did not respond to calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Industry insiders stressed that the Japanese are not unloading
U.S. properties willy-nilly. ``What we're seeing is a continued
steady flow of properties come onto the market,'' Rodman said.
``It's going to continue to be a good buying opportunity for U.S.
investors with capital.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman estimated the Japanese retain $50 billion of the
properties bought before 1993 and said the holdings are now worth
between $35 billion and $40 billion. ``Instead of 50 cents on the
dollar, they can now get 70 cents on the dollar,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman said the Riviera Golf Course, the Nikko Hotel in Beverly
Hills and several downtown buildings, including 777 S. Figueroa,
the Hyatt Hotel and the 72-story former First Interstate
headquarters, are some of the prominent Japanese-owned properties
around Los Angeles likely to be sold in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman also said the properties may be easier to sell if Japan
can tackle its banking crisis. On Monday, Tokyo approved a package
of laws that will allow the government to spend up to $566 billion
to recapitalize banks and protect depositors, which may make it
easier for owners of U.S. real estate to strike debt-forgiveness
deals.

 &HT;    NLCS goes back to Atlanta after Braves' 7-6 win over Padres
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Michael Tucker, who spent much of the summer playing
his way out of the Atlanta Braves' future, guaranteed the club of
at least one more tomorrow Monday night. Evenings like this don't
happen in real life.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by two runs with five outs remaining in the season,
Tucker blasted a three-run homer off Kevin Brown, making a
win-it-now relief appearance, and powered the Braves to an
improbable 7-6 victory over the San Diego Padres. The Braves become
the first team in LCS history to force a Game 6 after losing the
first three games of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta survived a two-run homer by Greg Myers off Kerry
Ligtenberg in the ninth inning when Greg Maddux came in to get the
final three outs.
</P>
<P>
   The series now returns to Turner Field, where the Braves will
attempt to draw even Wednesday afternoon. Left-hander Tom Glavine
will start for Atlanta. San Diego manager Bruce Bochy had planned
on starting Brown, but those plans are unclear after he threw 41
pitches in 1 1/3 innings of relief work and was charged with the
loss.
</P>
<P>
   The night appeared lost. Atlanta starter John Smoltz, undefeated
in his previous five postseason starts when the club was facing
elimination, gave up a Ken Caminiti two-run homer in the first.
After Atlanta finally scratched back to tie it in the sixth, Smoltz
allowed a John Vander Wal two-run homer with two out in the bottom
of the same inning.
</P>
<P>
   But in a remarkable sequence in the seventh, Ryan Klesko opened
the inning with a walk off Brown, who had relieved starter Andy
Ashby the
</P>
<P>
   inning before. Javy Lopez next delivered an infield single into
the hole at shortstop, and two batters later, Tucker yanked 3-2
pitch over the right-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker, who had driven in just 10 runs the entire second half of
the season while batting .186 in his last 156 at-bats, finished the
night with five RBIs. His seven RBIs in the postseason nearly
matches what he did the final three months of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz had shut down the Padres' order after the first, allowing
two singles to 17 batters, when Wally Joyner came up with two out
and reached on an infield single.
</P>
<P>
   Vander Wal, who owns a .438 career average against Smoltz,
followed and quickly fell behind 0-2, before Smoltz left a fastball
slightly up over the outer half of the plate. Vander Wal, who hit
five homers in 109 at-bats this year, lined the pitch to the
opposite corner, clearing the wall only a few feet from where
Caminiti's ball had landed in the first. The homer gave San Diego a
4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker drove in the Braves' first two runs to bring them back
from a 2-0 deficit. He tied it in the sixth, after Andruw Jones hit
a two-out single and stole second on the next pitch. Tucker drove
Ashby's next pitch into center to bring Jones around for a 2-2 tie.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves took what should have been a huge inning in the
fourth and turned it into a one-run disappointment. Javy Lopez,
Andruw Jones and Tucker strung together three straight singles to
cut the lead to 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Cox let Smoltz swing away at the first pitch, but then called
for a safety squeeze, a sign that confused Jones, who had to go to
third base coach Bobby Dews for clarification. Ashby pitched out,
and although the ball was low and outside, Smoltz pulled his bat
away, sure that the squeeze play was off.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones had run with the pitch and was halfway down the line
when Hernandez began the rundown. He was retired 2-5-1 on an
embarrassment (and the Braves' second blown squeeze of the series)
that left Cox muttering expletives at the foot of the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the miscue, Smoltz, two pitches later, placed a
swinging bunt that rolled dead two inches off the third base line
for Atlanta's fourth hit of the inning, placing men on first and
third. Ozzie Guillen ended the inning with a deep fly to center,
easily deep enough to score a runner from third had there been less
than two out.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz got off to the exact kind of start he wanted to avoid. He
walked No. 2 hitter Steve Finley on four pitches, and two batters
later Caminiti sliced Smoltz's first pitch to the opposite field
and just inside the left-field foul pole for an instant 2-0 lead.
The first inning has remained Smoltz's curse. Of the 58 runs Smoltz
allowed this year, 16 of them _ 28 percent _ came in during the
opponents' first at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti, who entered the game 3-for-13, hit his second homer of
the series, but the feat was a more personal one. The Padres third
baseman had gone 69 regular-season at-bats, plus three more in this
series, without homering against Smoltz, the longest he had gone
against any pitcher without a home run.

 &HT;    Playing like themselves again
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Maybe it came too late. Probably it came too late.
Still, winning Game 4 to force Game 5 beat the alternative. And now
comes John Smoltz, the winningest postseason pitcher ever, and if
Smoltz wins the NLCS returns to Atlanta, and if that happens . . .
</P>
<P>
   OK, we're getting ahead of ourselves. But the encouraging part
of Sunday's game _ other than the obvious bit about staving off a
sweep _ was that the Braves played like the Braves. They pitched.
They hit home runs. They showed the resolve they'd conspicuously
misplaced. They fell behind twice and were trailing as late as the
seventh inning. With oblivion beckoning, the Braves said, ``Thanks
all the same, but we'll head the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   This city was primed for a reckoning. ``Enjoy the sweep,'' said
the nice lady at the Qualcomm Stadium gate. The half-hour before
game time became a head-banging Lollapalooza. ``Sweep, sweep,'' the
throng chanted, and at that moment you could envision how this
would end: The Padres holding another narrow lead, Trevor Hoffman
trotting in from the bullpen, ``Hell's Bells'' blaring over the PA,
all heck breaking loose when the home team clinched its unlikely
pennant.
</P>
<P>
   But no. Hoffman didn't get to pitch. Ahead after six, the Padres
lost 8-3. Starter Joey Hamilton, asked to go two batters too far,
yielded a tying home run to Javy Lopez on the first pitch of the
seventh. Then Andruw Jones nubbed a ball toward second baseman
Quilvio Veras, who couldn't glove it.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Bochy summoned Randy Myers, the same Bruce Bochy who had
managed such a sterling Game 3 that he was named the Fox network's
star of stars. With two out, Myers faced Ozzie Guillen, lefty
against lefty. Guillen guided a single into left field, scoring
Jones and putting the Braves ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Then Keith Lockhart beat out another infield hit, a sure sign
that, at least for one night, things were breaking the Braves' way.
``They'd had a bunch of hits that just went through,'' Ryan Klesko
said. ``You just wonder, 'When's that going to happen for us?'''
</P>
<P>
   Myers loaded the bases and departed, replaced by Dan Miceli.
Andres Galarraga, 1-for-12 in the NLCS, drove Miceli's second pitch
over the wall in left-center field. Grand slam. The Braves had
scored more runs in the seventh than in the previous 34 innings
combined. Said Klesko: ``Sometimes that's all it takes for us _ one
big inning to turn it around.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Game 4 departure: The Braves managed to survive their
nemesis Jim Leyritz, who'd put the Padres ahead with a sixth-inning
homer off Denny Neagle. That looked for all the world like a death
blow, looked that way for maybe 10 minutes. Then Lopez applied the
kiss of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel it's a two-game series now,'' Bobby Cox had said
earlier Sunday. ``We need to win two here, then get back home and
see what happens.'' Afterward he amended his remarks: ``It's a
one-game series starting tomorrow, and then a two-gamer at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. You'd still rather be the Padres than the Braves. No team
has ever overcome a 3-0 deficit. Then again, no big-leaguer had hit
70 homers until this season of broken precedents. Could another be
about to fall? Said Klesko: ``It's always possible.''

 &HT;    The unfolding of a strange game
 &HT;    By Tim Tucker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ And this is how the NLCS, improbably, found its way
back to Atlanta. . . .
</P>
<P>
   _ Bottom of the first inning. Last thing John Smoltz wants to do
is walk the batter in front of Tony Gwynn. But he walks Steve
Finley. Then, after Gwynn flies out, Smoltz gives up a two-run,
two-out homer to a guy who had never homered against him, Ken
Caminiti. Padres, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   _ Top of the fourth. Remembering Smoltz's words of the night
before: ``The key (to coming back in the series) is that we have to
execute.'' The Braves have runners at first and third, one out, one
run in, Andruw Jones breaking from third, Smoltz squaring to bunt.
The Padres pitch out, and Jones is caught in a rundown. The inning
ends with the Braves getting one run out of four singles. This is
not the type of execution Smoltz had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   _ Top of the fifth. For the second time in the game, Chipper
Jones hits a ball hard. And for the second time, a San Diego
infielder makes a fine defensive play on him. Shortstop Chris Gomez
did it in the first inning, Wally Joyner now. The Braves were the
league's best defensive team in the regular season. In this series,
they have been the second-best defensive team.
</P>
<P>
   _ Top of the sixth. Andruw Jones is on second base with two out,
Michael Tucker batting, Smoltz on deck. An identical scenario
occurred in Game 1 of the Division Series. Both times, the opponent
inexplicably chose to pitch to Tucker rather than walk him to face
Smoltz. Against the Cubs, Tucker homered. This time, he singled to
tie the game at 2. Has Padres manager Bruce Bochy, Fox's ``player
of the game'' on Saturday, gone into a slump?
</P>
<P>
   _ Bottom of the sixth. Chipper Jones charges and barehands the
slow-footed Joyner's two-out ground ball, but drops it while
rushing a throw. To reiterate: The Padres are making the tough
plays in this series; the Braves are not. The next batter, John
Vander Wal, drills a two-run homer to left field. Padres, 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   _ Top of the seventh. After a leadoff single, the Padres make a
surprising call to the bullpen. Kevin Brown, their scheduled Game 6
starter, makes the third relief appearance of his career. If it
works, Bochy's brilliance is certified; if it doesn't, the Braves
might not only win Game 5 but improve their chances for Game 6. The
crowd, for its part, loves the move. Brown retires three straight
Braves to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   _ Top of the eighth. Brown, a Cy Young candidate, proves far
less efficient as a middle reliever than as starter. He walks Ryan
Klesko and allows an infield single to Javy Lopez and then, with
one out, Tucker crushes a three-run homer to right. Three batters
later, Tony Graffanino's double off reliever Donne Wall and a San
Diego error lead to two more runs. Braves, 7-4. Few Braves had
tougher seasons than Tucker and Graffanino. And look at them now.
Who knows what happens back in Atlanta Wednesday and Thursday? But
already the Braves are the first team in baseball history to lose
the first three games of a best-of-seven postseason series and win
the next two.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Japanese real estate giants, caught in the global
credit crunch, are unloading marquee Los Angeles-area holdings at
significant discounts, real estate experts said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest example, Tokyo-based Shuwa Corp. is expected to
ask more than $2 billion but accept much less for its portfolio of
U.S. properties, including Arco Plaza in downtown Los Angeles, two
Century City office buildings and a high-profile office tower in
Glendale, nine miles north of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 sell-offs continue five years of steady liquidation
from Japanese players who amassed $77 billion in American real
estate assets. During the portfolio buildup, Asians bagged trophy
properties such as the Hotel Bel-Air and New York's Rockefeller
Center.
</P>
<P>
   But now Japanese banks and corporations that bought at the peak
of the market in the late 1980s are being forced to sell at prices
falling as far as 50 percent below what they paid. U.S. property
values gained back some of their value after the recession, but
this year's worldwide economic slowdown halted that trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that Shuwa is going to get a lower price than they
would have before the market disruption,'' said Stan Ross, vice
chairman and managing partner of E&AMP;Y Kenneth Leventhal, a leading
tracker of Japanese real estate investment. ``Around the country,
you're seeing discounts of 5 and 10 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1993 and 1997, Japanese owners were forced to unload $26
billion of U.S. holdings at a loss of $10 billion, Ross estimated.
When will the discounting stop? ``That's anybody's guess because
the market has been so disrupted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for prime U.S. office properties, which had recovered
since the recession of the early 1990s, have dropped in recent
months because of declines in the stock market and the perception
that real estate investment trusts bid prices up to unrealistic
levels in the last 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   That means buyers are likely to be opportunistic groups, looking
for bargains, rather than the pension funds and endowments that
traditionally invest in top-line commercial real estate, Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing is unfortunate for Shuwa,'' said Grubb &AMP; Ellis
broker William Boyd. ``If they had put the portfolio up for sale a
year ago, they would have received higher offers than they're
getting now. The current crisis has only served to accelerate that
trend.''
</P>
<P>
   E&AMP;Y Kenneth Leventhal's Jack Rodman, managing partner of the
firm's Asian real estate operations, began advising Japanese
clients 18 months ago to sell U.S. holdings to real estate
investment trusts. He said he was largely ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``My view is that the Japanese missed a window of opportunity to
cash out,'' Rodman said. ``Their timing continues to be poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyd noted Shuwa paid $250 per square foot for the Glendale
property in 1988, a year after it was built by Reliance
Development. ``They bought at the height of the market, and it now
is most likely worth $210 a square foot,'' he said. ``It's kind of
a double whammy for them since the highest payers for those kind of
buildings may have retreated.''
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo-based Shuwa recently put its portfolio up for bid through
Eastdil Realty. The centerpiece of Shuwa's holdings is the 52-story
Arco twin towers, opened in 1972 with more than 2 million square
feet of office space and purchased in the late '80s by Shuwa for
$600 million.
</P>
<P>
   The vacancy rate in the building is now higher than 29 percent,
but economist Jack Kyser, who works in the building at the offices
of the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp., said the towers
remain an attractive site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The property has aged pretty well, and it has a certain cachet
because of its unique character,'' he said. ``A buyer would be
betting on the future economic health of Southern California and
making a bit of a bet on the future of downtown. The key thing is
that downtown is the center of the freeway and rail mass transit
systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Shuwa properties include two other downtown buildings _ the Gas
Co. building and the Chase Plaza _ as well as Taco Bell's corporate
headquarters in Irvine in neighboring Orange County and a pair of
Century City office structures. Kyser said there once was an
entitlement, since expired, for an 84-story structure on the Gas
Co. property.
</P>
<P>
   ``That entitlement was from back in the days when downtown L.A.
was the promised land,'' Kyser said.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Toronto-based real estate giant TrizecHahn Corp. reportedly has
bid $1.8 billion for the Shuwa portfolio. TrizecHahn, which
recently broke ground on a $380 million entertainment complex on
Hollywood Boulevard, did not respond to calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Industry insiders stressed that the Japanese are not unloading
U.S. properties willy-nilly. ``What we're seeing is a continued
steady flow of properties come onto the market,'' Rodman said.
``It's going to continue to be a good buying opportunity for U.S.
investors with capital.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman estimated the Japanese retain $50 billion of the
properties bought before 1993 and said the holdings are now worth
between $35 billion and $40 billion. ``Instead of 50 cents on the
dollar, they can now get 70 cents on the dollar,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman said the Riviera Golf Course, the Nikko Hotel in Beverly
Hills and several downtown buildings, including 777 S. Figueroa,
the Hyatt Hotel and the 72-story former First Interstate
headquarters, are some of the prominent Japanese-owned properties
around Los Angeles likely to be sold in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman also said the properties may be easier to sell if Japan
can tackle its banking crisis. On Monday, Tokyo approved a package
of laws that will allow the government to spend up to $566 billion
to recapitalize banks and protect depositors, which may make it
easier for owners of U.S. real estate to strike debt-forgiveness
deals.

BRAVES COME FROM BEHIND TO BEAT PADRES, 7-6
</HEADLINE>
   (sw)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ It may not have been Game 7 of the World Series. But
the San Diego Padres and Atlanta Braves sure played Game 5 of the
National League Championship Series on Monday night as if it were
deciding their respective seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it came down to Tony Gwynn against Greg Maddux, with
the tying run on first in the bottom of the ninth. Maddux, who was
making his first relief appearance in 11 years, won the battle of
future Hall of Famers, retiring Gwynn on a hard-hit grounder to
first.
</P>
<P>
   And the Braves, who had rallied from a two-run deficit in the
eighth to score five runs, including an improbable three-run home
run by Michael Tucker off of Kevin Brown, to take a 7-4 lead, had
survived with a 7-6 victory, one that enables them now to head home
to Atlanta for Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   Both managers took huge gambles with their pitching aces. San
Diego's Bruce Bochy sent Brown out to protect a two-run lead in the
seventh, but after Brown surrendered the homer to Tucker, the
Padres looked as if they were going to fall five outs shy.
</P>
<P>
   But then Greg Myers delivered a two-run pinch-hit home run off
Kerry Ligtenberg in the top of the ninth to trim a three-run
deficit to one. And now it was Bobby Cox's turn to make a move.
</P>
<P>
   Out came Maddux, who nailed down the first save of his
professional career, leaving the 58,988 previously frenetic fans at
Qualcomm Stadium in utter disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's scheduled Game 6 starter pitching in the seventh
inning? Atlanta's scheduled Game 7 starter pitching in the ninth?
What a series this has been.
</P>
<P>
   After losing the first three games of the National League
Championship Series, the Braves, who now head home down 3-2, are
not only alive, they actually believe they can win. And why not?
Atlanta not only finally found a way to beat Brown (who was making
a surprising relief appearance for just the second time in his
career) for the first time in over two years, the Braves overcame a
pair of two-run home runs against starter John Smoltz in a game
Smoltz had all but guaranteed he would win.
</P>
<P>
   The only way Atlanta can secure its place in history, General
Manager John Schuerholz acknowledged before a Game 5 that was
managed as if it were the seventh game, is by winning another World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing in Brown was a huge gamble on Bochy's part. Before the
game, Padres Pitching Coach Dave Stewart said that the Padres had
started Andy Ashby on Monday evening instead of Brown on three
days' rest because they did not want to make a panic-move.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown _ who had pitched a perfect inning of relief on July 4
_ had won his last six decisions against Atlanta, dating back to
1996. And, after Ashby delivered six solid innings, Bochy decided
to go for the kill. It is a move he may always regret.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who had shut the Braves out in Game 2 after defeating
them twice for Florida in last year's NLCS, had come on in the top
of the seventh with a runner on and promptly retired the side to
protect the 4-2 lead John Vander Wal had given San Diego with an
unlikely sixth-inning home run off Smoltz.
</P>
<P>
   But Ryan Klesko fouled off two full-count pitches to work a
lead-off walk in the eighth. Javy Lopez followed with a first-pitch
infield single to short. And, after Andruw Jones popped out to
first, Tucker stepped to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta right-fielder had already driven in the Braves'
first two runs with run-scoring singles in both the fourth and
sixth. This time, Brown fell behind 3-0 before getting the count to
full. With the crowd noise reaching an almost deafening pitch _ and
on what would become Brown's final pitch of the evening, and maybe
the series, as well _ with one fateful swing, Tucker took the life
out of both the Padres and their crowd.
</P>
<P>
   As the ball cleared the fence in right to give the Braves a 5-4
lead, Tony Gwynn doubled over at the fence as Brown did the same to
the left of home plate. The crowd gasped in unison, as Tucker had
driven in Atlanta's first 5 runs. And after the Braves rallied for
two more in the inning off Donne Wall, the Braves not only had a
3-run lead, they were about to go home.
</P>
<P>
   By winning Game 4 on Sunday, the heavily favored Braves had not
only avoided what would have been a humiliating sweep, but they had
also enabled the winningest pitcher in post-season history to make
one more start.
</P>
<P>
   And Smoltz was confident coming in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it like I'm not going to be the guy to let the
season end,'' Smoltz said late Sunday. ``It won't be me.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz could make so bold a prediction because he had been here
before. In the 1992 World Series and the 1996 league championship
series, Smoltz pitched on the road with the Braves trailing, 3-1,
and enabled Atlanta to take the series back home. In all, Smoltz
had pitched three times with the Braves facing elimination, and the
Braves had won each time.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we found a way to win Game 1, we found a way to win Game 2
and we found a way to win Game 3,'' Tony Gwynn said before the
game, the inference being that the Padres had already found their
way past the triumvirate of Smoltz, Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux
that makes up Atlanta's pitching core. ``Hopefully, we'll find a
way to win one more.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, while there was no precedent in major league history of a
team coming back from a 3-0 deficit to win a post-season series, in
1996 against the Cardinals, the Braves rallied from a 3-1 deficit
behind the same three pitchers who were scheduled to pitch Games 5,
6 and 7 of this series.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the Braves seemed to exude a quiet confidence
before Monday night's game, even though they realized that they
still had their work cut out for them. Of the 22 teams who have
been down by 3-0 in a series, the Braves became only the fourth
team to win Game4. And no team had won again to force a Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to happen sometime,'' Atlanta President Stan Kasten
said today. ``But, for somebody to do it, it would require this
type of rotation.''

SPORTS COLUMN: SOMEONE SAY PANIC? JUST PASS THE BUTTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ There had been a strange sense in the air. The San
Diego Padres, the team that had gone up by three games to none and
then by three games to one in the National League Championship
Series, might have some cause for alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe because the heavily favored Atlanta Braves were the team
that had just won its first game in the series, on Sunday _ coming
from behind twice _ and now had the Cy Young triumvirate coming up
in Games 5 and, if it came to pass, 6 and 7.
</P>
<P>
   So Messrs. Smoltz, Glavine and Maddux were ready. And the
Padres? Well, Andy Ashby was the Padre pitcher next in the
rotation, and was slated to start on Monday night. Why, the Padre
pitching coach Dave Stewart was asked Sunday night, would Kevin
Brown, the relatively rested ace of the staff, not pitch in Ashby's
stead?
</P>
<P>
   ``To use Brown,'' replied Stewart, ``would be an act of panic.''
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh inning of Monday's game, guess who came in to
relieve for the Padres?
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown! Was this some kind of act of panic on the part of
Padre manager Bruce Bochy?
</P>
<P>
   Or was this so brilliant a move that it would dazzle the beastly
Braves, end this series and catapult the Padres into the World
Series?
</P>
<P>
   Brown had been virtually invincible in Game 2, throwing a
three-hit shutout in Atlanta, and striking out 11.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres on Monday night had taken the lead by 2-0, and then
the Braves had tied the game in the sixth. Just as they had done
the day before. And then in the seventh, Ozzie Guillen led off the
inning for the Braves with a single off Mark Langston, who had
replaced Ashby on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   A huge roar rose from the crowd of 58,988 in Qualcomm Stadium.
Here came the lengthy fast-balling, madly intense Brown, striding
in from the left-field bullpen. The crowd stood and cheered his
every pitch to pinch-hitter Greg Colbrunn, and he struck him out,
Colbrunn unaccountably breaking his black bat in half on his final
swing. Brown got the next two batters to fly out and pop up.
</P>
<P>
   This was Casey at the Mound _ and reversing the old ode and
saving Mudville.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves were battling not only Brown and the Padres, but
their self-respect. They have been to seven straight league
championship series, and they have won one World Series. They are
either the greatest team of the 1990s or the greatest also-rans.
``If we don't advance,'' the Braves' general manager, John
Schuerholz said, ``it would be like an unfinished symphony.''
</P>
<P>
   In Game 4, the fans chanted ``Sweep! Sweep!'' When that didn't
work, they switched in Game 5 to the conventional ``Charge!
Charge!''
</P>
<P>
   But hold on. It's the eighth inning and Brown walks the lead-off
hitter, Ryan Klesko. He gives up a single to Javy Lopez, but forces
Andruw Jones to pop to first. Up comes Michael Tucker, who had
driven in the Braves' two other runs. Brown delivers and Tucker
parks one over the right-field wall. The Braves, improbably, take
the lead, 5-4. At the mound, Brown bent over, his hands on his
knees, as though he had just been hit with a karate chop.
</P>
<P>
   No chants of ``Sweep!'' from the fans. No ``Charge!'' No
nothing. The ball park was as silent as the moon. And they stayed
that way as Brown was removed for another reliever, Donne Wall.
Poor Casey. He had, sadly, missed the boat again. The Braves scored
twice more in the inning to take a 7-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Padres scored two in the ninth, Bobby Cox took a
page from Bochy's book and brought in Maddux, who, unlike Brown,
preserved a victory in dramatic fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Until Game 4, the Braves had scored just three runs in three
games. Their lumber, as their manager, Bobby Cox, had said in so
many words, was a-slumber. Then they awoke in Game 5, winning 8-3.
The Padres, however, could surely have avoided any thought of panic
with the cushion of knowing that no team in baseball history had
come back from a 3-0 deficit to win a four-of-seven series. Oh,
there had been two teams in hockey who had accomplished the feat,
but that's a horse of a different odor.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Braves did come back from being down 3-1
against St. Louis in the 1996 NLCS. And, come to think of it,
that's precisely where the two teams stood as they listened to the
singing of the national anthem before Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that but the Braves won the next three games against
the Cardinals by pitching their three Cy Young Award winners,
Smoltz in the fifth game, Maddux in the sixth and Glavine in the
seventh. All that was changed this time around was that Glavine and
Maddux would be transposed in the rotation. Not much of a change if
you happened to find yourself in the batter's box wearing a Padres
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see any panic,'' said Ashby, before Monday's game.
</P>
<P>
   None, of course. None at all. None, perhaps, for Game 6, on
Wednesday in Atlanta, either.
</P>
<P>
   Or Game 7, when Brown would presumably next be available.
</P>
<P>
   Oh brother, this is getting as good as McGwire and Sosa. &QL;

BLUE-CHIP PREP CHOOSES USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC has received an oral commitment from Aaron
Graham, an inside linebacker from Bakersfield High School.
</P>
<P>
   Graham (6-foot-1, 220 pounds) chose the Trojans over Washington,
Arizona, Arizona State, California and Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed the environment at USC and I wanted to commit
early,'' Graham said. ``Now I can concentrate on my senior season.
USC slipped into the No.1 spot on my list because it was nearby and
I thought I could get a good education.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham had favored Washington over the summer before switching
to the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   He is listed as a preseason All-American by SuperPrep magazine
and led Bakersfield with 22 tackles for losses last season.
</P>
<P>
   Graham is the fifth player to commit to the Trojans. USC has
also received commitments from Los Alamitos defensive lineman
Bernard Riley; defensive lineman Malcolm Woolridge of Boca Raton,
Fla.; tight end Jacob Rogers of Oxnard and linebacker Markus Steele
of Long Beach City College.
</P>
<P>
   Bitten by the Bear: Cal stunned the Trojans in the second half
of its 32-31 victory with the use of the Bear defense, which
employs six defensive players rushing the quarterback. It became
famous when Buddy Ryan was the Chicago Bears' defensive coordinator
in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Bear defense that allowed Cal to sack freshman
quarterback Carson Palmer in the end zone for a safety in the third
quarter, starting the Bears' 22-0 run.
</P>
<P>
   It also helped Cal record six sacks against the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   One reason it was so effective was that Cal used it sparingly
this season and the Trojans had not practiced intensely against it
during the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came out in the second half and caught us a little off
guard,'' tackle Ken Bowen said.
</P>
<P>
   Morton questionable: Tailback Chad Morton's status remains in
doubt this week. Morton participated in some light running Sunday,
but his bruised back continues to bother him.
</P>
<P>
   Nice debut: Defensive end Ryan Nielsen's switch to tackle was
considered a success. Nielsen made two tackles and had one of the
best performances on the defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal High graduate will probably play the position the rest
of the season because Marc Matock is not expected to return from
his broken ankle until late November at the earliest.

McNOWN MAKES THE RIGHT MOVES 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The headline in Monday's Daily Bruin proclaimed:
``Bruins Win Despite McNone.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, quarterback Cade McNown hit just 10 of 24 passes at
Arizona. And yes, he has a 49.3 completion percentage in the last
three games. He has overthrown receivers. He has thrown into
coverage. He's even struggling with mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to make more routine plays,'' coach Bob Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   But he's hardly ``McNone.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA is 4-0, ranked No. 2, averaging 48 points per game, and
McNown is performing his most important duties with typical
proficiency.
</P>
<P>
   _He's making big plays. With the Bruins trailing Arizona 28-24
late in the third quarter, McNown dragged three Wildcats into the
end zone on a short touchdown run. A few minutes later, he threw a
perfect pass to Danny Farmer for a 64-yard touchdown that gave UCLA
control.
</P>
<P>
   _He's not making mistakes. In one of the Pac-10's most hostile
environments, with Arizona blitzers charging from all angles and
the crowd noise making it difficult to hear audibles, McNown did
not fumble or throw an interception.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Arizona quarterbacks Keith Smith and Ortege Jenkins
threw two interceptions, which the Bruins converted into 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   _He's leading.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got up on us (in the first half) and had a little
momentum and some of the guys started to get scared,'' offensive
tackle Kris Farris said. ``Cade came over and said, `It's just like
the Cotton Bowl (when UCLA trailed 16-0). We'll be fine. We're
gonna win.'''
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Defensive end Kenyon Coleman will play Saturday
for the first time since spraining his right knee Sept. 19 against
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Short stuff: Keith Brown was named UCLA's offensive player of

BLUES DEFEAT RANGERS, 4-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was not as if New York fans had nothing to cheer
and chant about on Monday night at Madison Square Garden. They made
a joyous noise late in the first period when the scoreboard screen
showed the image of David Wells, the New York Yankee pitcher,
sitting in the hockey crowd on an off night during the American
League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go Yankees!'' the fans chanted repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   But before long, they could have said to each other, ``Let's go
home.''
</P>
<P>
   In an embarrassing performance, the Rangers lost to the St.
Louis Blues, 4-2. The competition was not that close, and there
were plenty of empty seats at the final buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat left the Rangers with a 0-3 record and grouped with
the New Jersey Devils and the New York Islanders at the bottom of
the Atlantic Division. In three games, the Rangers have scored only
3 goals and 59 shots on goal. Against Philadelphia, Montreal and
St. Louis, they have been outscored by 12-3. And they have lost
most of their face-offs, too.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that was one of the reasons Wayne Gretzky told Esa
Tikkanen to wait before stepping up to take a draw with St. Louis
ahead by three goals.
</P>
<P>
   Better to let the fans continue their ovation for Wells, Gretzky
figured, and Tikkanen obeyed.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Wells stopped by the Ranger dressing room.
``Touch me,'' Gretzky said to the hefty pitcher. ``Maybe the good
luck will rub off.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells extended his hands and they exchanged light slaps.
</P>
<P>
   Hands were just part of the problem for the Rangers' starting
goalie, Mike Richter, who gave up five third-period goals in a 7-1
loss at Montreal on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, Richter took a seat after giving up three goals
in the first period to St. Louis defenseman Al MacInnis. One of the
shots came from the neutral zone near the Rangers blue line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to stop the puck more,'' Richter said. ``I don't
mean to be funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Cloutier replaced Richter and played well in the last two
periods. But the early goaltending was only the beginning of the
Rangers' difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to implement Coach John Muckler's style of puck pressure,
the Rangers seemed flat-footed, as the Blues whipped around them.
One of the most telling moments came early in the evening when the
Rangers were trying to skate the puck out of their zone. They made
eight passes behind their blue line before icing the puck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a lot to think about,'' Muckler said.
</P>
<P>
   He has shaken up his forward lines, replacing Tikkanen on
Gretzky's left wing with Niklas Sundstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Tikkanen, a veteran who came to training camp as a free agent,
won the left wing job alongside Gretzky. But he seems a step slower
now that the regular season has begun. With Sundstrom back
alongside Gretzky, as he was last season, the line helped set up
goals by Ranger defensemen Brian Leetch and Aleksandr Karpovtsev in
the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't Tikky's fault,'' said Gretzky, absolving his
teammate of blame for that line's failure in the first eight
periods of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not, and it might be that the good third period and
respectable final score created an illusion. The goals were scored
against a team that relaxed after thoroughly outplaying the Rangers
in the first 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are idle until Friday night, when the Devils visit.
Muckler said he was not sure who would be his starting goaltender
for that night, and he may make more changes at forward.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to have Todd Harvey back from a hip injury to add some
muscle at right wing.
</P>
<P>
   Tikkanen seemed better at center, where the Rangers have no
regulars besides Gretzky and the rookie Manny Malhotra.
</P>
<P>
   John MacLean, signed as a free-agent right wing, found himself
at left wing last night and had no shots on goal.
</P>
<P>
   Left wing Kevin Stevens, earning more than $3 million, was a
healthy scratch and was not happy about it. ``I can't help from
where I'm at,'' he said, referring to the stands.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how Muckler mixes and matches, the Rangers have
been exposed as a seriously flawed team lacking youth, speed and
depth. The natural impulse for fans will be to demand that Neil
Smith, the president and general manager, make trades for younger
skaters and scorers. But age and high salaries on the Rangers'
roster make it hard for a general manager to overhaul the team.
</P>
<P>
   One who won't go is Gretzky, trying to salvage something from
his 20th season and playing almost half the game. Between the
second and third periods, as his teammates skated off, Gretzky bent
over near the bench as if hanging his head.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he should have stopped in the television studio, where
Wells was telling the interviewer that the Yankees, too, lost their
first three games of the season. Look where they are now. &QL;

<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Unless the University of Florida and
Florida State are playing in Gainesville or Tallahassee, football
in the Sunshine State does not usually cause fans across the state
to get so worked up that they froth at the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   But for the first time, the Jacksonville Jaguars and Miami
Dolphins met in the regular season, and a ticket to the
Monday-night game at Alltel Stadium was so hard to get, you would
have thought the Gators and Seminoles were teeing it up.
</P>
<P>
   But this was Jacksonville vs. Miami, and a stadium-record crowd
of 74,051 watched quarterback Mark Brunell throw two fourth-quarter
touchdown passes to receiver Keenan McCardell to give the Jaguars a
28-21 victory over the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Brunell and McCardell, the Houston native who resides in
Greatwood in the offseason, connected for the second time with 2:36
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   After Olindo Mare missed a 54-yard field-goal attempt for Miami,
Jacksonville took possession at its 44. On the first play,
McCardell got behind cornerback Terrell Buckley and hauled in a
perfect pass from Brunell for a 56-yard touchdown that gave
Jacksonville the win and allowed the Jaguars to improve their
record to 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great call,'' McCardell said. ``It was a post-corner
route. At a time like that, someone has to step up and make a play.
I'm paid to make plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the other half of this duo (receiver Jimmy Smith) goes
out with an injury (a pulled hamstring), it's time for me to earn
my money.''
</P>
<P>
   Brunell completed 12 of 18 passes for 213 yards and the two
touchdowns. McCardell, who dropped a long pass in the first half,
had only three catches, but he made them count for 86 yards and
both touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie running back Fred Taylor scored the first two
Jacksonville touchdowns. The Jaguars allowed the Dolphins to score
three consecutive touchdowns before rallying in the fourth quarter
behind Brunell and McCardell.
</P>
<P>
   Brunell's perfect pass and McCardell's clutch catch ruined Miami
quarterback Dan Marino's best performance of the season. After
failing to pass for 200 yards in each of the first four games,
Marino was 30-of-49 for 323 yards and two touchdowns. But it wasn't
enough to keep Miami from falling to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put ourselves in a hole right off the bat,'' Miami coach
Jimmy Johnson said. ``Our guys hung in and put us in position to
win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an exciting finish to a game that began in electrifying
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the way the Jaguars started the game, they should
have blown out the Dolphins, but Jacksonville did just enough to
let Miami stay close.
</P>
<P>
   On the first play, Taylor broke through the right side and
outran every Miami defender for a 77-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the first quarter, the Jaguars began a six-play,
53-yard drive that Taylor finished with a two-yard scoring run.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by 14, Miami's offense finally put together a decent
drive.
</P>
<P>
   Marino completed five passes for 63 yards. On third-and-goal
from the two, he used a play-action fake and found tight end Troy
Drayton alone in the end zone. Drayton had to dive to catch the
ball for the touchdown. Replays showed the ball slipped through
Drayton's arms and touched the ground, but the officials didn't see
it.
</P>
<P>
   Miami didn't take long to tie the score. On their opening series
of the second half, the Dolphins needed 10 plays to cover 55 yards.
Because of penalties, they faced third-and-goal from the 23 but got
a tremendous break when safety Travis Davis was called for
interference, giving Miami a first down at the one.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' penalty rubbed out an end-zone interception by
Jacksonville's Donovin Darius. Two plays later, Karim Abdul-Jabbar
scored from the one to make it 14-14 with 10:29 left in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Miami scored again on its next possession, going 63 yards in
nine plays. The 15-yard touchdown came when Marino found Drayton
alone on the left side for an easy score.

JAGUARS BEAT DOLPHINS, 28-21

<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Miami and Jacksonville had never played a
regular-season game before Monday night, so who knew what to expect
in their Floridian fling?
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of spurts, almost like a basketball game, was the way it
unfolded. And Jacksonville produced the final fast break, the one
that broke things open and gave it 28-21 victory before 74,051 fans
at Alltell Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville is 5-0 and in the American Football Conference
Central, Pittsburgh (4-2) trails the Jaguars in a race that could
be a Jaguars runaway. Miami (3-2) dropped its second straight.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Brunell passes to Kennan McCardell produced two
fourth-quarter touchdowns that gave Jacksonvile the lead. And then
in the final minutes, with Miami and Dan Marino driving to showcase
the game's final spurt, Jaguars end Tony Brackens stole the ball.
There was 1 minute 51 seconds left and Miami was in Jacksonville
territory and Marino set up in the pocket near midfield. Brackens
raced around right end, slapped the ball out of Marino's hands as
Marino looked downfield and then Brackens recovered it, too, at the
Miami 48.
</P>
<P>
   Drive over. Game over.
</P>
<P>
   Marino was 29 of 47 for 320 yards with two touchdowns and one
interception. Brunell was 12 of 18 for 213 yards with two
touchdowns and one interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was one of the toughest defenses we've faced and we had
to change things around a little bit,'' Brunell said. ``It worked.
There was a lot of talk going on out there. A lot of
extracurricular activities.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a game of spurts. Jacksonville scored the game's first 14
points. Miami scored 21 consecutive points. And then Jacksonville
scored another 14.
</P>
<P>
   The final 14 came in the fourth, when Brunell twice hit with the
speedy and crafty Keenen McCardell. He is a receiver full of
juke-and-jive moves and he used both to score on grabs of 23 and 56
yards. The 56-yarder proved the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Just when Jacksonville thought it was on its way to keeping the
Dolphins in check _ the Jaguars built a 14-0 lead and looked as if
they could do what they pleased _ the Miami defense answered by
putting more pressure on Brunell. The Miami offense answered with a
mixture of gritty runs and zinging Dan Marino passes where his
receiver kept leaping high and diving low to make big catches.
</P>
<P>
   Miami trimmed the Jacksonville lead to 14-7 just before
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   And then five minutes into the second half, Miami caught the
Jaguars at 14-14.
</P>
<P>
   And before the third quarter was over, Miami had the lead,
21-14.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Jacksonville and Miami spurts were consistent. It can
happen like that when quarterbacks get hot and when defenses get
hotter.
</P>
<P>
   This game began with a bang. Fred Taylor, the rookie back from
the University of Florida, took the first play from scrimmage 77
yards for a touchdown. It was a quick-trap-like cutback runner, a
quick-hitter up the middle where Taylor took the ball backside and
burst past the overeager Dolphins. Miami had a chance to track him
down and take him down near the Miami 10, but Taylor wanted to get
into the end zone. And he did. He simply fought throught the
Dolphins arms trying to pull him down from behind and carried
onward.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter Jacksonville outgained Miami 191 yards to
49 even though both teams ran 14 plays. Taylor's 2-yard run early
in the second quarter that made it 14-0 concluded a 53-yard,
six-play drive.
</P>
<P>
   Miami scored on the possession that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Miami and Marino blew a chance for more points with 6:07 left
before halftime when Terrell Buckley intercepted Brunell at the
Jacksonville 36. Two plays later Marino was intercepted at the
Jacksonville 10 by cornerback Aaron Beasely.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Miami would respond after halftime with a third
quarter of domination. It led in possession time 10:11 to 4:49 in
the quarter. It led in first downs by 9 to 2 in the quarter. But
most important, it led in points in the quarter, 14-0.
</P>
<P>
   To start the quarter Miami produced a 55-yard drive that took
nine plays and finished with a Karim Abul-Jabbar 1-yard scoring
run. It was 14-14. And then Marino threw a beautiful strike in the
left corner of the end zone to Drayton for 15 yards for another
Miami touchdown. A little more than 11 minutes had elapsed in the
third quarter and Miami led 21-14 on touchdowns scored on its first
two possessions.
</P>
<P>
   It would not stand, though.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville had another spurt left. &QL;

CANUCKS, CALLS FINISH OFF KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER _ The Kings thought they had tied the score. But they
never should have been trailing to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   Less than three minutes remained in Monday afternoon's 4-2 loss
to the Vancouver Canucks. At the time, the Kings were down a goal,
pressing on a power play and trying for the equalizer.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Moger's shot from point-blank range was stopped by Canucks
goalie Garth Snow, and the rebound came to Rob Blake in the slot.
Moger was pushed into the crease by Canucks defenseman Murray
Baron, and Blake fired the puck into the net.
</P>
<P>
   The red light came on, but almost immediately referee Stephen
Walkom, upon the advice of a linesman, was waving his arms, ruling
Moger had been in the crease. Walkom disallowed the apparent goal
and could not be dissuaded by the heated argument waged by Blake
and Luc Robitaille.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes later, Alexander Mogilny scored into an empty net,
and the Canucks had opened their season by turning a one-goal
deficit after 40 minutes into a victory before a less-than-sellout
crowd of 16,071 at GM Place.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, whose home opener is Friday night against the Boston
Bruins, fell to 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll lose a game,'' Kings coach Larry Robinson said of
Walkom's call. ``I don't mind losing a game. But I don't like when
games get taken away from me, and that's what happened right
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The disallowed goal was actually the second of the game for the
Kings, and the second of the game involving Moger. In the final
minute of the second period, with the Kings leading 2-1, video-goal
judge Malcolm Ashford _ invoking powers granted those officials
this season _ called down to Walkom to disallow an apparent goal by
Philippe Boucher because Moger was in the crease.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first one, (Moger) definitely had his skates on (the
crease),'' Robinson said. ``But the second one was a bad call. He
was definitely pushed in. It makes for a heck of a long year when
you've got to battle both sides all the time. Just make it fair for
both. That's all I ask. And that's why I'm so in favor of having
the two-referee system. Then, you've got four eyes out there.
(Walkom) had a bad night tonight. I guess we all have bad nights.
That was definitely a bad night for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the two calls, Moger said: ``The first call, I was in. On the
second call, there's no doubt I was pushed in.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the latter call, with 2:31 left in the game, Baron
said: ``I pushed him. Whether he made an effort to get out of the
crease, I don't know. I haven't seen the replay. They called it off
right away. Whoever made the call was sure. Whether the Kings had a
beef or not, I can't say.''
</P>
<P>
   Against a team that was the worst in the NHL's Western
Conference a year ago, a team that won only twice last year when
trailing after two periods, a team playing without disgruntled star
winger Pavel Bure, and a team with a defense that provided them
with lots of operating room, the Kings shouldn't have been trailing
late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   But they took too many penalties _ the Kings were shorthanded
eight times in the game, for 14:15 of the game's 60 minutes _ and
were unable to capitalize on most of their opportunities. Both of
the Kings goals came off the stick of center Yanic Perreault, who
has scored three of their four goals this season.
</P>
<P>
   Perreault, a streaky player who finished second on the Kings a
year ago with 28 goals, gave the Kings an early 1-0 lead when he
fired home a loose puck after a deflected shot from the point by
Doug Bodger landed on his stick.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the game turned into a duel between Snow and Kings
goalie Jamie Storr, making his season debut. Peter Zezel finally
tied the score for Vancouver late in the second period on the
deflection of a shot by Todd Bertuzzi, but Perreault put the Kings
back in front on a shorthanded breakaway less than three minutes
later.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver's Dave Scatchard tied the score 1:44 into the third
period _ Robinson said he thought the Canucks might have been
offside on the play _ and Zezel's power-play goal at 10:48 proved
the game-winner. Zezel scored on a well-placed blast from the right
faceoff circle that glanced off Storr's left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought Zezel's shot had been a perfect one, Storr
said: ``It's still not acceptable on my part. I don't think
anything is perfect. It's something I've got to work on.''
</P>
<P>
   But Robinson was less concerned with that than the victory he
felt had been taken from the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too bad,'' Robinson said. ``You work hard, and it's hard
to get points, and especially early on in the season you want to
get points. To have them taken away like that, that's very, very
disappointing.''

FAMILY PARTY ENDS IN TRAGEDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Five-year-old Salvador Sanchez couldn't wait for
his father's birthday. That morning, he jumped up and down on his
bed, ecstatic that he and his eight brothers and sisters would be
reunited for the party.
</P>
<P>
   He took out his shiniest boots and crafted a birthday card in
Spanish: ``To my papa. I love you much. Happy birthday! From:
Salvador.''
</P>
<P>
   Salvador never got a chance to eat birthday cake.
</P>
<P>
   In another blow to a family beset by hardship and tragedy, a
hit-and-run driver struck and killed the youngster Sunday as he and
his 11-year-old brother tried to cross an unmarked crosswalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was asking me to put on his favorite boots to look nice,''
Sanchez's mother, Leticia Lozoya, said Monday in between crying and
burying her face in her hands. ``His boots are still waiting there
for him because he never put them on.''
</P>
<P>
   Detectives are searching for the alleged driver, identified as
Reynaldo Chavez Manso, 21, who is accused of fleeing in a red
four-door 1983 Toyota Camry. He is described as a Latino, between 5
feet 7 inches and 5 feet 10 inches.
</P>
<P>
   The unmarked crosswalk in the Pacoima neighborhood north of
downtown Los Angeles has been a source of many near misses
involving children, according to residents and business owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids go across all the time. I don't know why there's no
lighted crosswalk or stop sign,'' said David Salazar-Rodriguez, a
business owner. ``Sometimes, you think it's clear and, Boom! They
just come out.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident happened as the boys were returning home from a gas
station where they had gone to pump up the tires of their bicycle.
They had sneaked out of the house, said Lozoya, 32.
</P>
<P>
   Salvador was hit by a car as the boy and his brother crossed
westbound on Remick Avenue at about 4:10 p.m. Sunday, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Salvador and his brother stopped in the center of the road, but
suddenly Salvador bolted into the path of the Toyota, said Officer
Connie Silber of the Los Angeles Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Battazar Perez, a worker at the gas station, heard the impact.
``The other brother ran around like crazy trying to help his
brother,'' said Perez, whose eyes filled with tears while
recounting the incident. ``My stomach is turning. I love kids.''
</P>
<P>
   A witness chased the driver for three miles, hollering for him
to return to the scene, said Detective Humberto Fajardo of the
Valley Traffic Division. The witness did get the license plate
number: 2EQG614.
</P>
<P>
   It was a horrific end to a joyous day for the Sanchez family, a
family that already has suffered tragedy with one child and was
split up by Los Angeles County child welfare authorities.
</P>
<P>
   One of Salvador's brothers, Heriberto, 4, has been comatose for
a couple of years since he choked on food at home, said Marina
Sanchez, Salvador's aunt.
</P>
<P>
   That incident led the Department of Children Services to take
custody of the nine kids, Sanchez said. Four children and Salvador
went to a Panorama City foster home, and four others live with
their grandmother in Pacoima.
</P>
<P>
   This Sunday was supposed to be special for Salvador because of
his father's 40th birthday and his family would be gathering at his
parents' home for the party, Sanchez said. He had been counting the
days until a judge would decide whether some of his older siblings
could be returned to his parents, his aunt said.
</P>
<P>
   Salvador's parents had saved enough to move from a single-room
home to a one-bedroom house in Pacoima, making them eligible to
take back their three oldest children, she said. And the
grandmother was trying to adopt the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had been working as much as they could. She cleans homes
and he works in construction,'' Sanchez said. ``Now this happened,
so we don't know what's going to happen.''

SEAHAWKS ENTER BYE WEEK SEEKING ANSWERS TO INCONSISTENCIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ The Seahawks enter their bye week convinced
they remain a playoff contender, but also knowing that changes must
be made if they are to advance to the postseason for the first time
since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's 21-16 loss to the Denver Broncos continued a three-game
flurry of mistakes and errors that also cost the Seahawks in road
losses at Kansas City and Pittsburgh the previous two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Now 3-3, the Seahawks probably need to win seven of their
remaining 10 games to stay in the playoff hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's too much to overcome,'' defensive end
Michael Sinclair said. ``If anything, it's frustrating. We've been
in these games and we've had a chance to win them. But we're not
getting it done.
</P>
<P>
   ``During this bye, we're going to have to evaluate a lot of
things _ a lot of things,'' he said. ``If we're going to call
ourselves a playoff team, we'd better start playing like one.''
</P>
<P>
   That evaluation process already has begun. Three big problems
must be addressed in this week's practices:
</P>
<P>
   (Insert bullet) Establish some offensive consistency. The
Seahawks rank 22nd in the league, a perplexing plunge from last
year when they were No. 3 overall and had the NFL's top-rated
passing game. The defense has scored a third of the team's 15 TDs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been sitting in here all morning trying to figure out
what's wrong,'' coach Dennis Erickson said Monday. ``We're just not
playing very well.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the offense can't get the job done. There have
been enough flashes to indicate the pieces are in place. But there
also have been too many penalties (16 against eight different
players in the past two games) and not enough big plays (only one
longer than 50 yards in six games).
</P>
<P>
   Erickson plans to simplify the running game and balance the
attack with more passing _ the strength of last year's offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got too many things that we're doing, so we're a little
tentative getting off the football,'' Erickson said. ``We've got to
condense it.''
</P>
<P>
   Look for the Seahawks to go with only five or six different
blocking patterns in the running game, and also to go right at the
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Also look for more one-back formations featuring Ricky Watters,
and for rookie Ahman Green to become more involved in the offense.
Of course that's not saying much since Green has not carried the
ball in the past three games. But Erickson says Green will be used
to spell Watters, even if it's only four or five carries a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to try and improve ourselves offensively,'' Erickson
said. ``If we don't, we're in for some tough games.''
</P>
<P>
   (Insert bullet) Stop the run. The defense has played so well
it's difficult to find fault. But the Seahawks must improve their
efforts against the run. They rank 12th overall, but only 26th in
rushing defense, allowing an average of 147.8 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Davis dashed and bashed his way to 208 yards Sunday.
Even without his 70-yard run late in the fourth quarter, he
averaged 4.8 yards a carry.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three weeks, Davis, Pittsburgh's Jerome Bettis (138
yards) and Kansas City as a team (131 yards) have rung up their
highest rushing totals of the season against the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Still on the menu are San Diego's Marion Butts (twice),
Oakland's Napoleon Kaufman (twice), Dallas' Emmitt Smith,
Indianapolis' Marshall Faulk and a rematch with Davis _ all among
the top 11 rushers in the league.
</P>
<P>
   (Insert bullet) Get more big plays from the special teams. The
most obvious problem Sunday was penalties _ six of them for
holding. But special teams coach Pete Rodriguez says they can be
corrected by working on better technique, and you can believe he
will have everyone working on better technique this week.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger concern is the lack of big returns and giving up too
many big returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we can still get the job done in the next 10 games.
There's no doubt in my mind, and I doubt there's very much doubt in
the players' minds,'' offensive coordinator Bob Bratkowski said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating. We wanted to win for sure two of these last
three, if not one of these last three, and we didn't do it. But
it's not the end of the season. We're capable of beating everyone
else on our schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks' remaining opponents are a combined 25-21. Toss out
the rematches with the Broncos and Chiefs and the record dips to
15-19. The Chargers (twice). The Raiders (twice). The Cowboys. The
Oilers. The Jets. The Colts. All winnable games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's probably writing us off already, that's fine with
me. It doesn't really matter,'' guard Brian Habib said. ``It's
early in the season. We've got a long way to go. We've proved to
ourselves we can play with anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played a team like Denver really tough. We blew it at the
end, but we definitely had a chance to win that game and I think
that's really something to build on.''

GALLEY CAN ONLY WATCH, WAIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER _ For the second time in as many games in the new
season, Garry Galley watched from the stands.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, less than three hours before what would be a Kings' 4-2
loss to the Vancouver Canucks on Monday afternoon, Galley was busy
getting his workout for the day _ in the team's hotel exercise
room.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that a year ago the veteran defenseman signed with
the Kings as a free agent and was one of their major summer
acquisitions, the way this season has begun for the 35-year-old
Galley has to rank as a major disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Galley appears to be keeping the situation in
perspective and is trying to be patient as he waits for a chance to
play. Last year, he appeared in 74 games and was second among Kings
defensemen with nine goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing I've done,'' Galley said of being a healthy
scratch for the season's first two games. ``(Coach) Larry
(Robinson) has told me that. My age works against me. It's not like
I played badly. Larry just said he's got a lot of defensemen who
are all capable of playing. I'm not going to play as much as I'd
like to at the start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hanging in there. It doesn't mean I like it. You can go
about it two ways. You can let it eat you up, or you can know that
when you get a chance to play, you can play as hard as you always
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Not only did the Kings lose the game, they lost
center Ian Laperriere with a sprained left knee in the second
period.
</P>
<P>
   Laperriere was injured in a collision with a Vancouver player.
He is scheduled to be examined today by team physician Dr. Ronald
Kvitne.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Robinson used the same lineup as on opening
night. In the first 120 minutes of the season, defenseman Rob Blake
has received the most playing time (52 minutes, 49 seconds on 58
shifts) and winger Matt Johnson the least (13:31 on 18 shifts).
Left wing Luc Robitaille has taken seven shots in each game (he's
scored one goal), and center Yanic Perreault is shooting 50 percent
with three goals on six shots.... Kings television announcer Bob
Miller celebrated his 60th birthday. ``I felt just as creaky
getting out of bed this morning as I did yesterday morning,''
Miller said when asked if he felt any different.... A Canucks fan
won $100,000 in a puck-shooting contest during the first
intermission.

LOSING SEASON? UNTHINKABLE FOR WASHINGTON NOT TOO FAR-FETCHED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Sometime in the dark aftermath of a loss to Arizona,
the thought occurred to Josh Smith, the University of Washington
defensive end: Could this be the season?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want this to be the year the Huskies slip,'' he
said. ``I wouldn't want people looking back and saying, `Yeah, you
were part of that class that had a losing season.'''
</P>
<P>
   They don't talk a lot about it around the UW, because the
Huskies usually aspire to bigger things. But Washington has a
streak of 21 consecutive winning seasons, one that dates back
through 1977.
</P>
<P>
   The streak is tied with Florida State's for second-longest
current nationally, to Nebraska's 35, and is tied for 10th all-time
in the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost a non-issue to most Husky players, because to them,
a long time ago is 1990-92. That's when Washington was going to
three straight Rose Bowls, winning a national title and rubbing
elbows with college football's gentry, setting a tone that prevents
a goal of a 6-5 season from ever crossing their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hasn't once,'' said Joe Jarzynka. ``I don't even consider
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the Huskies 3-2; a rejuvenated, 4-1 California team
coming Saturday and Washington facing a nasty stretch of schedule
to finish the year _ at USC, at Oregon, UCLA and at Washington
State _ a losing season at Montlake is not as far-fetched as a
Clinton-Starr dinner date.
</P>
<P>
   A loss to either the Bears or Oregon State the following week
could put the Huskies at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shouldn't happen,'' Jarzynka said, referring to an end to
the streak. ``I refuse to let it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington is an 10{-point favorite over California and should
also be a strong choice over Oregon State. But as unthinkable as a
losing season would be to the Huskies, they can gain a greater
appreciation for the long-term success of the program by seeing how
other Pac-10 programs have occasionally stumbled.
</P>
<P>
   Every other school in the Pac-10 has had a losing season in the
'90s. UCLA has had four in the past decade, Arizona State has had
two. Indeed, the Sun Devils (2-4), seen by some as a preseason
national-championship threat, might be working on another, with
games left to play at Oregon and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like, when teams win so much, and then they lose,
they lose confidence,'' says UW defensive tackle Mac Tuiaea. ``It's
almost like they don't know how to react, because they've never had
to deal with that kind of adversity before.''
</P>
<P>
   But Washington has managed to motor through NCAA scholarship
restrictions, demanding schedules and Pac-10 sanctions to prevent a
truly down year. Thirty of the 44 players on Washington's two-deep
roster this week were born after the Huskies completed their last
losing season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough when you go through sanctions,'' said UW coach Jim
Lambright. ``It's hard enough without sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   Three times in the streak (1977-78, 1989), the Huskies have been
3-3 after six games. In all three cases, they surged. The first
near-miss was in 1987, when they took a 5-4-1 record into the Apple
Cup here against Washington State, won the game and then survived
Tulane in the Independence Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the Huskies were 5-4 when they made their biggest
comeback ever to beat Cal, 28-27. Then they lost to WSU to finish
6-5.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday when the Huskies came down the tunnel, senior
offensive guard Tony Coats had tears streaming down his face. It
wasn't Utah State that aroused him, it was the urgency to restore a
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you'd wanted to write an article about us taking Utah State
lightly,'' Lambright said, ``Tony Coats would have folded you up
and stuffed you into the middle of Lake Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Huskies had a losing season, 1976, was the
last year they lost to Cal. Omen? The Huskies don't believe in
them, any more than losing seasons.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Developers working to bring a National Football
League team to the Coliseum are proposing a major sports and
entertainment-themed makeover for all of Exposition Park to turn it
into a top family destination.
</P>
<P>
   The concept _ involving interactive attractions, stores,
restaurants and movie theaters _ would complement the existing
complex of museums in Exposition Park, and would be located on the
current Sports Arena site and on 10 acres across Figueroa Street,
said those involved in formulating the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we'd like to do is create a center of activity like Third
Street Promenade created for Santa Monica or CityWalk ... or Old
Town Pasadena,'' said Tony Christopher, president and chief
executive officer of North Hollywood-based Landmark Entertainment
Group.
</P>
<P>
   His company is brainstorming a master plan for Exposition Park
on behalf of New Coliseum Partners, headed by developers Ed Roski
Jr. and Philip Anschutz, who are trying to obtain an NFL franchise
for Los Angeles. Roski and Anschutz, who co-own the pro Kings
hockey team, also are developing the new Staples Center, the future
downtown home of the pro basketball Lakers and Clippers, and Kings.
</P>
<P>
   The Exposition Park plan _ while only conceptual and secondary
to renovation plans for the interior of the Los Angeles Memorial
Coliseum _ should allay concerns among NFL owners that the Coliseum
project has something to overcome as it vies with a proposal by
former superagent and Disney executive Michael Ovitz for a Carson
stadium-retail complex, and with a stadium plan in Houston, said
John Semcken, executive vice president of the Coliseum group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an opportunity there that we don't have anywhere else
in the country,'' he said. ``We want to make Exposition Park an
exposition again, make it a major tourist destination.''
</P>
<P>
   Landmark has 18 years of experience in this area, said
Christopher. The company has designed three Universal Studios
attractions, the Star Trek Experience at the Hilton Hotel in Las
Vegas and the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for Exposition Park includes an NFL-themed attraction
where families might be able to pass, punt and kick together, among
other activities, Semcken and Christopher said. Landmark also is
proposing a Monorail-like people mover to carry visitors around
Exposition Park, Christopher said.
</P>
<P>
   No price tag has been placed on the proposal yet, Semcken said.
</P>
<P>
   The three groups competing for an NFL franchise are scheduled to
present their proposals to the 31 NFL owners Oct. 27 in Kansas
City. A final decision is not expected to be made at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The Coliseum group also has hired NBBJ Sports &AMP; Entertainment of
Los Angeles to develop a new architectural plan that would take the
vast stadium designed for the 1932 Olympics down to 70,000 seats,
including 10,000 exclusive club seats.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to make it a more intimate NFL-style bowl while
respecting the architectural integrity of the Coliseum as much as
possible, said Dan Meis, NBBJ's principal designer.
</P>
<P>
   The Coliseum Commission is scheduled to vote Oct. 21 on a formal
agreement with New Coliseum Partners that would give them two years
to try to land an NFL franchise. Mayor Richard Riordan is backing
the group's plan.

PRESSURE MOUNTING FOR NORTHRIDGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHRIDGE, Calif. _ Last week it was cool to be ranked. It
created a tingly feeling at Cal State Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, it's a little different. CSUN jumped to 16th in
both national polls, up seven spots in the Sports Network poll and
eight spots in the USA Today/CNN coaches poll, but expectations
have changed greatly after Saturday's 21-7 win against then-No. 18
Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ecstatic about what the rest of the country thinks about
us right now,'' CSUN coach Ron Ponciano said. ``We didn't
anticipate being up at the top of the standings right now, but you
can't lose a game, or two games, and it not be a big issue. You
lose it all. That's a luxury we do not have in football.''
</P>
<P>
   In its second week, the novelty of being ranked is wearing off.
When CSUN (4-1, 3-0 Big Sky), the leaders of the conference, plays
at Sacramento State on Saturday the rest of the Division I-AA world
will pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   The playoffs are at stake, and it will be that way for the rest
of the season. Or until CSUN drops a pair of games and falls out of
that race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking, `Holy Cow, we're in first place,''' Ponciano
said. ``We're going to dink around here and all of a sudden find
ourselves in a football game. That's the exciting thing. But then I
get back to reality and thinking about the task at hand, and that
is a potentially dangerous football team who will be exceptionally
fired up with us coming in there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors are 103rd in the latest Sagarin ratings, which puts
them 15th among I-AA teams. The only other Big Sky team ranked
ahead of CSUN is Weber State (5-1, 3-1), which fell to No. 13 in
both polls after losing to Montana State.
</P>
<P>
   Friendly call: A week after seeing his own defensive line
brutally chop-blocked by Southern Utah, Ponciano didn't like a
couple of things he saw on the Montana game film.
</P>
<P>
   From his own players.
</P>
<P>
   So he called Grizzlies coach Mick Dennehy to apologize.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have outside receivers coming in and clipping guys in
the box, and when you see a back high-low with an offensive lineman
on a defensive lineman, that's a problem,'' Ponciano said. ``We
don't teach that, and it happened so I called Mick to apologize.
I'm very embarrassed that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Shifting the line: In an effort to get more production from the
offensive line, Ponciano said he's shifting Mike Barnes and David
San Vicente. Barnes, who started three games at left guard, is
expected to start against Sacramento State at left tackle. San
Vicente, CSUN's left tackle most of the season, will move to left
guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like we need a bigger push inside and a quicker, more
athletic guy on the outside right now,'' Ponciano said. ``Those are
the answers we've come up with. We're having too many problems
there right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Matadors' depleted defensive line should get some help
this week. Erik Gardner, Mike Colunga, Jacob Mageo and Patrick
Cwik, each of whom missed the Montana game, are expected to play
against Sacramento State.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner is the most intriguing of the returners. He injured his
knee in the opener against Boise State and hasn't yet returned to
contact drills.
</P>
<P>
   More honors for Swanson: For the third week in a row, CSUN
linebacker Brennen Swanson grabbed an award. Swanson, who had three
sacks and 11 tackles, was named the Big Sky Defensive Player of the
Week for the second time in three weeks. Swanson was the I-AA
National Player of the Week last week.
</P>
<P>
   Short yardage: The loss knocked Montana out of the top 25 for
the first time since the 1992 season.... CSUN quarterback Marcus
Brady dipped to No. 2 in passing efficiency (167.5) in the country.
He's completed 105 of 151 attempts for 1,338 yards, 12 touchdowns
and two interceptions.

DODGERS WANT TO TALK TO BAKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After getting turned down by Felipe Alou, the Dodgers will ask
the San Francisco Giants permission to talk to Dusty Baker about
filling their vacant manager's spot, club sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Like Alou in Montreal, Baker is the heart and soul of the
Giants, probably the one figure they can least afford to lose. And
like Alou, Baker still is under contract with two years remaining.
</P>
<P>
   So the Dodgers must receive permission to formally speak to
Baker, who won the National League West in 1997 and led the Giants
this past season to a wild-card playoff with the Chicago Cubs after
picking up four games in the final week.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Kevin Malone refused to comment on the
possibility of snatching the popular former Dodgers left fielder,
who just happens to manage the club's most bitter rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a process that must be followed at the risk of
tampering with people under contract,'' Malone said. ``There are
quality people out there and we will look into them.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone has spoken to Davey Johnson, whose references include
World Series and division championships managing the New York Mets
and division titles with the Cincinnati Reds and Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   But no interview has been scheduled for Johnson, who was in
Baltimore in 1996-97 when Malone was an assistant to Orioles GM Pat
Gillick. Johnson is reportedly very interested in the job and
anxious for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, who began his search two weeks ago with a phone call to
former Florida manager Jim Leyland, said the earliest he would talk
to Johnson would be at the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear where Davey is wondering about an interview, but I've
been in touch with him and he knows what is going on,'' Malone
said. ``There were two situations that needed to be addressed. I
knew Leyland didn't want to come to Southern California (he signed
with Colorado), but I needed him to tell me that and he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I needed Felipe's situation to run its course. I was
hoping he'd come and thought he would, but his ties to Montreal
were too strong. Those were unique situations. That is not a
reflection of the Dodgers manager's job.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is a proven winner, but has not gotten along well with
ownership during his three managerial stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say he is difficult is not true,'' Malone said of Johnson,
who lives in Orlando, Fla. ``Maybe he was like that earlier, but he
wasn't difficult to work with in Baltimore. He has his own style.
He is considered something of a maverick, but he just wants to win.
I think that is a misrepresentation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources said the Dodgers also are expected to contact Minnesota
about Tom Kelly, who led the Twins to World Series titles in 1987
and `91 but has been working under severe budget constraints the
past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly is still under contract so permission to talk must be
granted by the Twins. Kelly has promised the Twins he will stay at
least one more season, but with a payroll under $25 million, it
will be difficult to field a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Another candidate is Milwaukee's Phil Garner, whose club
faltered in the second half of its first season in the National
League. Brewers general manager Sal Bando received a contract
extension last week but said Garner's status is under review.
</P>
<P>
   The thread running through Baker, Kelly and Garner is the lack
of a competitive payroll. Baker had the highest at just over $40
million, a figure Giants owner Peter Magowen hopes to keep in place
in 1999. But the Giants still lost $15 million last year despite
their success. The Dodgers projected payroll for 1999 is $75
million.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The Dodgers traded right-hander Eric Weaver to the
Seattle Mariners for 19-year-old right-hander Scott Prouty. In a
late-season callup, Weaver went 2-0 with a 0.93 ERA in seven games
after spending most of the season at Triple-A Albuquerque. Prouty,
pitching in the Arizona Summer Rookie League, went 3-2 with a 2.44
ERA in 11 starts for Peoria.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAN DIEGO _ Almost 7,000 empty seats greeted the Padres at Qualcomm
Stadium late Monday afternoon. This after San Diego had
consecutively drawn four of the largest crowds in postseason
history.
</P>
<P>
   Had the rats decided to leave what they perceived to be a
suddenly sinking ship?
</P>
<P>
   Goodness, the Padres were leading the NLCS three games to one _
a virtually insurmountable lead, based on a century's worth of
evidence _ and it was Columbus Day to boot. Maybe the city's
fair-weather faction, ever-inclined to hit the beaches, was
actually overconfident and had decided to save some expendable
income for those even more high-dollar World Series tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Which, oddly enough, still go on sale here tonight, damn the
torpedoes. The stadium PA man, between sobs, made the announcement
moments after the Braves had beaten the Padres 7-6, thanking the
fans for ``keeping the faith'' and saying he would see them in the
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Uh-huh. Ever hear the expression, ``whistling past the
graveyard''?
</P>
<P>
   John Moores, the kind, benevolent San Diego owner and expatriate
Houstonian, has said he loves baseball so much he almost can't
stand it. I wonder, however, if he still feels that way, after his
pride-and-joy ballclub, which was perched a mere four outs from
attending the Fall Classic and had its superhero Kevin Brown
throwing BBs, is now only going back to Dixie.
</P>
<P>
   Where there's suddenly a pretty decent chance it can do what no
team before it has ever managed: cough up a 3-0 lead in the
postseason. To hang on, the Padres have to get past either Tom
Glavine or Greg Maddux. No lock in that, is there?
</P>
<P>
   Especially with Brown, who remains the likely Game 6 starter
opposite Glavine on Wednesday night, suffering through an emergency
crisis of confidence. There will be a measure of scar tissue, if
not an open wound, after this, no matter how well he has mastered
the Braves in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking that Kevin's going to go anyway,'' Padres manager
Bruce Bochy said. ``We'll talk about it on the flight and then make
a decision tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta had erupted for six runs in the seventh inning Sunday _
four on Andres Galarraga's wake-up-call grand slam off Dan Miceli _
to steal its first win from the Padres' klutzy clutches. But that
was nothing compared to what the Braves accomplished Monday,
considering against whom they accomplished it.
</P>
<P>
   Let's call Kevin Downtown Brown, because that's where Michael
Tucker took him with two men on in the eighth, mere minutes after
Brown, Atlanta's ber-nemesis of late, had strode heroically in from
the bullpen to what must have been the longest, loudest ovation
ever heard in these parts. The 58,988 who had ventured out were so
happy to see him.
</P>
<P>
   Their affection didn't last long, though. By the time the top
half of the eighth had concluded, Brown was slumped over in the
dugout, his cold, hard gunslinger's eyes turned downward in
despair, and the Braves, five runs the richer, were just far enough
in front, 7-4.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, they would need the two additional runs that
scored, in large part because of bonehead plays by San Diego, after
Tucker's full-count dinger off a Brown sinker that sank only in
figurative terms.
</P>
<P>
   When Greg Myers ripped a pinch-hit two-run shot in the Padres'
last-gasp ninth, it so unnerved Atlanta manager Bobby Cox that he
must have temporarily lost his mind, summoning Maddux from the
bullpen. Cripes, hadn't Bobby paid any attention to how Brown,
Maddux's stud-duck counterpart, fared in relief?
</P>
<P>
   But Cox's own bizarre gambit paid off, unlike poor Bochy's
botched move. Maddux, seeking his first save of the decade in his
first such appearance since his Cubs salad days, straight away
thwarted a would-be Kirk Gibson-redux scenario. He struck out the
pinch-hitting Greg Vaughn, who had pulled up lame in Atlanta last
week and hadn't played since, on three pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Quilvio Veras then bounced to short before Maddux walked Steve
Finley to bring up Tony Gwynn, creating the ultimate of game-ending
matchups _ the best pure hitter of the modern era vs. its finest
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   That high-noon showdown went badly for the Padres as well.
Gwynn, 35-for-79 over the years against Maddux with nary a
strikeout, slapped a slow grounder to first base that Galarraga
handled by his lonesome. That was that. And so the Friars find
themselves in same.
</P>
<P>
   Plumb Tucker-ed out, they may be.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the baby-faced assassin, wonder if a No. 8 hitter
has ever done greater damage in a bigger game? Before his clout off
ol' Downtown, he had already driven in runs in the fourth and sixth
innings.
</P>
<P>
   His five-RBI outburst exceeded his total for the previous four
games by exactly five, although he had socked a two-run homer in
the first Division Series win over Chicago. Back then, the Braves
were in the midst of what would become a 10-game winning streak,
and their tortured pursuit of an elusive second world championship
of the '90s, after seven consecutive NLCS appearances, appeared a
most viable goal.
</P>
<P>
   As it does again. Although the Padres may still be leaders, they
probably feel more like followers.

IT DOESN'T GET BETTER THAN THIS  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _Wow! Incredible! Unbelievable! Extraordinary!
Stupendous!
</P>
<P>
   Attach whatever adjective you want to Game 5 of the National
League Championship Series and it still won't do justice to the
game that unfolded between Atlanta and San Diego at Qualcomm
Stadium on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   One thing's certain, Atlanta's heart-stopping 7-6 victory over
the Padres, who have lost two in a row after winning the first
three games, will surely be remembered as one of the greatest games
ever played, one that will be talked about for years.
</P>
<P>
   Players from both sides were mentally exhausted after Andres
Galarraga smothered Tony Gwynn's grounder to end 3 hours, 17
minutes of the highest type of drama sports has ever produced.
</P>
<P>
   There was such a sense of urgency to this game that each manager
brought in his ace _ Kevin Brown for San Diego and Greg Maddux for
Atlanta _ to make a very rare relief appearance.
</P>
<P>
   It was Maddux, making his first appearance out of the bullpen
since he was a rookie with the Chicago Cubs in 1987, who got Gwynn
to ground out for the final out of a most memorable game.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux entered the game having started 499 of his 505 games
since turning pro as a scrawny 18-year-old kid from Valley High
School in Las Vegas. He left having registered the first save of
his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun,'' Maddux said. ``I don't think any of us was ready
to go home yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Braves did go home Monday night. But not to dwell
on what went wrong in 1998. Instead, the Braves' late-night
charter, which must have had a carnival atmosphere, had to be
filled with talk of rewriting history.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego grabbed a 2-0 lead in the first, only to watch Atlanta
chip away and tie the score in the top of the sixth before John
Vander Wal slammed a two-run home run off John Smoltz in the bottom
of the sixth, sending the 58,988 fans into a delirious state of
mind.
</P>
<P>
   There was Brown, who entered to a thunderous ovation with a
runner on in the seventh, retiring the first three batters he faced
to get out of the inning, receiving a wave of high-fives from his
teammates in the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Then Brown, the biggest of the Braves slayers, gave up a walk, a
single and a foul popout before Michael Tucker stepped into the
batter's box.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker, an above-average fastball hitter, lined a 3-2 pitch into
the right-field bleachers. The deafening noise inside the stadium
fell silent, so much so that a baby crying on the other side of the
massive park could have been heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nobody's fault but my own,'' said Brown, making only
the third relief appearance of his brilliant career. ``I'm the one
making the pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   What appeared like a runaway just two days ago has shaped into a
history-making event. Never in the previous 18 times that a club
had grabbed a 3-0 lead in a best-of-seven series had the opponent
managed to force a sixth game. Now it has happened.
</P>
<P>
   In what has arguably been the greatest season in the 129 years
of major league baseball, why not have a club return from a 3-0
deficit for the first time?
</P>
<P>
   ``It would certainly be a fabulous end to a fabulous season,''
Atlanta General Manager John Scheurholz said. ``This is what it's
all about.''
</P>
<P>
   The game took more twists and turns than the famous Coney Island
Cyclone roller-coaster. The dips made your stomach tingle and the
peaks brought you out of your chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm mentally drained,'' San Diego center fielder Steve Finley
said. ``It was up, down, up, down. You didn't know what was going
to happen next. It was probably the best game I've ever been
associated with.''
</P>
<P>
   They came ready to party in San Diego on Monday night. There was
champagne chilling in the bowels of the stadium. There was plastic
wrap applied to the Padres' lockers that had to be torn down
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   It now appears 20-game winner Tom Glavine will oppose San
Diego's Sterling Hitchcock in Game 6 on Wednesday. Should there be
a Game 7 _ get ready for this one _ it will pair Brown against
Maddux.

DRUGS POSE OLYMPIC QUANDARY   
 CHANGING PERCEPTION IS TOUGH AS DETECTION  
</HEADLINE>
 TESTING-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tests are high-tech. The drugs are sophisticated, hard to
spell and harder to define. Performance enhancing, recreational or
over-the-counter? The issues are complicated. The debate is
contentious.
</P>
<P>
   But the cause of all this consternation is simple, and the
result is as predictable as it is lamentable _ guilt by
association.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, is one explanation of the exploding drug problem
from a longtime member of the International Olympic Committee's
medical commission during a panel discussion Monday. It's also an
explanation of why it's such a flash point for Olympic officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're free of drugs and you win today, you're still
suspected of having used drugs,'' Dr. Donald Catlin said at an
Olympic Congress workshop.
</P>
<P>
   Catlin believes that unless the trend and suspicion-fueled
perceptions can be reversed, the battle against drugs will be lost.
</P>
<P>
   The recent death of Florence Griffith Joyner provides a chilling
example of both sides of the issue. Her record-setting times in the
100- and 200-meter runs before and at the 1988 Olympics were so
extraordinary that many assumed that they were achieved through
drugs. She never failed a drug screening. But that did not quiet
suspicions, which were raised again when she died at age 39.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sadly, FloJo's reputation hinges on the autopsy results. It's
the unfortunate fallout for positive tests that have scarred many
of the world's record-setting athletes, including Ben Johnson,
Randy Barnes and Michelle Smith. It, in fact, is a problem that
goes back as far as 1972 when U.S. swimmer Rick DeMont, currently a
University of Arizona assistant swimming coach, was stripped of a
gold medal for taking a respiratory medication prescribed by his
doctor. But the depth of the problem has multiplied as science has
discovered new and harder to detect means of building strength,
speed, stamina and endurance.
</P>
<P>
   More trouble came with this year's Tour de France, the crown
jewel of bicycle racing that was nearly canceled when a drug
scandal caused dozens of the world's best riders to be banned or to
quit.
</P>
<P>
   The controversies are forcing the U.S. Olympic Committee and IOC
to reassess the way they combat an issue that threatens sports'
entire credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Weightlifting was one of the first sports to be hit with
positive tests for steroid use and suspicions of wide-spread abuse
of performance-enhancing substances that are either new or go
undetected.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's seven-member panel included weightlifter Wes Barnett, a
two-time Olympian who has been urging vigilance in the drug battle
since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the discussion, Catlin, founder of the UCLA
Olympic Analytical Laboratory, turned to Barnett, a silver and
bronze medalist at the 1997 World Championship, and said:
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't just congratulations for Wes because he won. We
think he won because, well, he's a weightlifter.''
</P>
<P>
   There's little debate about the lack of tolerance for
performance-enhancing substances in sports, but there is contention
on a number of other fronts. Namely:
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana and how it figures in the fight against
performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The state of the battle, especially in the wake of home run king
Mark McGwire's use of over-the-counter androstenedione, which is
banned in the Olympics but not by baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The methods. Should the USOC hire and/or create an independent
agency to conduct testing? And how can the testing procedure
efficiently and economically be used to detect new substances?
</P>
<P>
   Catlin said the variety of drugs will continue to grow and could
overwhelm the ablity to detect them. Some are hormones, such as
testosterone, that are produced naturally in the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's natural, but you have to prove it is foreign,'' Catlin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there is a synthetic hormone such as EPO, the substance
that rocked the Tour de France. It can't be detected at all, Catlin
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I think we're going to lose the battle,'' Catlin
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Catlin and panelists Baaron Pittenger of the USOC, attorney
Richard Young, Canadian physician Andrew Pipe, White House
representative Robert Housman and USOC anti-doping committee member
Christopher Lindsay still offered suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   The marijuana issue is at the top of their agenda, in large part
because of positive tests of a gold-medal-winning snowboarder at
the last Winter Games in Nagano and of 1996 Olympic sprinter Gary
Hall Jr., a gold- and silver-medal winner from Phoenix Swim Club.
</P>
<P>
   Housman, assistant to Gen. Barry McCaffrey of the National Drug
Control Policy, argued that Olympic sports should test for
marijuana. He cited health reasons and the athletes' responsibility
as a role model.
</P>
<P>
   ``When an elite athlete gets caught (using pot), the message is,
`Hey, I can do that, too.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But the pot issue is another step on very slippery slope, Young
and Pipe argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to ask: Is it job-related,'' said Young, a Colorado
attorney and chairman of the International Court for Sports
Arbitration. ``It is not a performanceenhancing drug used in an
attempt to cheat. Marijuana is a social vice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to deal with a moral virus, then let's have a code
of ethics.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the IOC is expected to make pot a prohibited
substance for all sports, according to Young, who added that
consistency is pivotal.
</P>
<P>
   At Nagano, it was not prohibited by the association that governs
snowboarding. In the Hall case, there were conflicting reports from
FINA, swimming's international governing body, about whether he had
committed a second offense in May when a positive test resulted in
a two-month suspension. One FINA official said he had tested
positive at the Atlanta Games. Another FINA official said pot was
not illegal at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   According to Young, FINA was wrong with its contention that Hall
was liable for a positive test in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``For drug-control purposes, it might might well have been
baking soda,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of how to wage the battle against
performance-enhancing drugs, there were proposals from Barnett and
Catlin.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett asked for further vigilance and strict enforcement of
bans that are too often lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to enforce the sanctions that we have,'' he said. ``I
keep finding myself suddenly competing against guys who I thought
had been banned for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnett also had some offbeat ideas. He suggested spies to
infiltrate sports that are suspected of having a high-rate of drug
use.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett also suggested that scientists develop a counter pill
that would make athletes violently ill if they had been using
performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something to stop them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Catlin proposed a voluntary system, a highly publicized program,
for athletes determined to stop the abuse. Those athletes would
agree to be monitored at all times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give them badges, and I mean the kind of badges that all
athletes would want,'' Catlin said. ``We would constantly notify
the public that these athletes are drug free.''
</P>
<P>
   Catlin and Pipe argued there could be a change in growing
pressure to use drugs. It is increasingly unacceptable because of
education and media messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Above all, we've got to change the culture of sport,'' Catlin
said.
</P>
<P>
   One step under consideration is in the approach. Thus far, the
USOC conducts its own testing. But that has created a perception of
a potential conflict of interest. In part, the USOC is in the
business of winning medals for America. The perception is that it
might be tempted to overlook drug use by its best athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts our credibility,'' said Pittenger, chairman of the
USOC's anti-doping committee.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the USOC study includes the feasibility of an
independent agency that also would work for the NCAA and
professional sports, according to Pittenger. The proposal is due
for consideration at the USOC's board of directors meeting in
April.
</P>
<P>
   A joint effort with pro sports is difficult because of the
acknowledged use of andro _ a precursor to testosterone _ by
McGwire, a 1984 Olympian before he went on to stardom with the
Oakland A's and St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are trying to do has been undermined by Mark
McGwire,'' Pipe said. ``Unquestionably, the issue has eroded much
of our work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see baseball's feet put to the fire on this. I
have seen the negative impact, in terms of suspicion, that this
kind of thing can cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has the right to believe that achievement in sports
is authentic and not artificial.'' &QL;

BRAVES' COMEBACK CULLED FROM HIGHER PLACE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The talisman that had worked wonders for the Atlanta
Braves before in must-win National League Championship Series games
was on the mound. But on Monday you had to wonder if it wasn't the
St. Christopher's medal tucked away in the pocket of manager Bobby
Cox that did the trick.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-6 victory the Braves pulled off in Game 5 of the
best-of-seven series was a small miracle. Never mind what it says
in the Atlanta media guide about Michael Tucker coming to the
Braves two years ago from Kansas City. On this night he looked like
he was heaven-sent.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves didn't appear to have a prayer after Ken Caminiti and
John Vander Wal each smoked Atlanta ace John Smoltz for two-run
homers as the Padres took a 4-2 lead into the seventh inning and
trotted out their ace, Kevin Brown, for a rare relief appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Brown opened the eighth by walking Ryan Klesko. Javier Lopez
then singled to right. After Andruw Jones popped out, up to the
plate stepped Tucker, an outfielder of no real renown.
</P>
<P>
   Five outs. That's all the Padres needed to ice their first World
Series appearance since 1984. Tucker certainly didn't seem like
he'd be a major obstacle in their path; he had struck out twice and
flied out against Brown in Brown's nine-inning masterpiece in Game
2.
</P>
<P>
   That was then. This time Tucker took Brown to a full count, then
lifted a fastball over the right-field fence to knock the wind out
of the Padres and the 58,918 fans who had flocked to Qualcomm
Stadium to see San Diego punch its ticket to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   It was the most dramatic swing seen around these parts since
Kirk Gibson's shot against the Oakland A's at Dodger Stadium in
Game One of the 1988 World Series. By the time the stunned Padres
recovered their wits, the Braves had added two more runs.
</P>
<P>
   Donne Wall replaced Brown and walked fellow reliever John
Rocker. After Ozzie Guillen struck out, Tony Graffanino doubled in
Rocker, advanced to third on the throw from the outfield and scored
on shortstop Chris Gomez' wild throw.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez' error would loom large when, in the bottom of the ninth,
Padres pinch hitter Greg Myers aimed to thrill, hitting a two-run
homer off Kerry Ligtenberg that brought the Padres to within 7-6
with no outs.
</P>
<P>
   Power-hitter Greg Vaughn, who had sat out the previous three
games with a strained left quadriceps muscle, was summoned to pinch
hit and Greg Maddux sauntered in from the Braves' bullpen _ yes,
you read that right. Maddux, making his first career postseason
appearance in a relief role, struck out Vaughn and got Quilvio
Veras to ground out. After walking Steve Finley he handcuffed Tony
Gwynn, who hit a weak dribbler to first baseman Andres Galarraga to
assure Maddux his first career save.
</P>
<P>
   So it was the Braves became the first team in major-league
history to lose the first three games of a postseason series and
force at least a sixth, to be played Wednesday in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are now 8-4 when facing elimination in the NLCS and
don't think it hasn't dawned on the Padres that Atlanta's rich
legacy in the `90s includes rallying from 1-3 to the St. Louis
Cardinals two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That said, history remains firmly on the side of the Padres.
Only two teams in all of professional sports have prevailed after
falling behind 0-3: the Toronto Maple Leafs against Detroit in the
1942 Stanley Cup Finals and the New York Islanders against
Pittsburgh in the 1975 Stanley Cup quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres still have two match points, so to speak. But you
have to wonder if they'll be able to pick themselves up after
failing to keep the Braves down. If Games 4 and 5 were a stern test
of Atlanta's character, Game 6 will measure the Padres' fortitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we showed a lot tonight after what happened,'' Padres
manager Bruce Bochy said, straining to put the best light on a
dark, dark night. ``We kind of let the game get out of hand once
they took a one-run lead. But we battled back.''
</P>
<P>
   From the outset the Braves thought they had a good chance in
this one because sending Smoltz to the mound in a must-win game is
like calling on John Elway to lead a last-minute touchdown drive or
Michael Jordan to score a last-second basket.
</P>
<P>
   He was 2-0 in NLCS elimination games, with an ERA of 0.82. Only
the Padres seemed unimpressed. Caminiti struck in the first and
Vander Wal in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz allowed nine hits in 62/3 innings. If not for Tucker,
that would have been all the opening the Padres needed to shut the
door on the Braves. Instead, they're still alive in their drive to
make those 106 regular-season wins mean something.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of you have said we're one of the class organizations
in baseball and we're proud of that,'' said Braves general manager
John Schuerholz. ``We're proud of the fact we have put ourselves in
that position now for eight years. (It's) remarkable when you think
about this crazy economic situation in which we're forced to
operate to be able to continually keep a winning team. But we also
feel there is sort of the unfinished symphony. Unless we win the
World's Championship, we're not satisfied.'' &QL;

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
SAN DIEGO _ There still is time for those who abandoned the Atlanta
Braves' bandwagon to jump back on the steam-building carriage.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Next stop: Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves wriggled free of the noose for the second game in a
row, claiming a 7-6 come-from-behind victory over the reeling San
Diego Padres on Monday night and sending the National League
Championship Series back to Atlanta's Turner Field for Game 6 on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres still hold a 3-2 lead in the best-of-seven series,
but they are gradually losing their grip on the NL pennant they
seemed destined to own after taking a 3-0 lead in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told you we could make it interesting,'' Braves manager
Bobby Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Cox and counterpart Bruce Bochy managed as if there were no
tomorrow, and in Cox's case, there wasn't. Both managers used their
ace starting pitchers to protect leads.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maddux got the job done for the Braves, but Kevin Brown
finally ran out of magic. Braves right fielder Michael Tucker, who
was 3-for-4 with five RBIs, belted a three-run, eighth-inning homer
off Brown to give the Braves a lead they never relinquished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for a pitch I could drive, and I was fortunate
to get a pitch like that,'' said Tucker, whose blast gave the
Braves a 5-4 advantage. ``I didn't miss it. I knew (a home run) is
what we needed to put us ahead. This was a great game. There have
been times in the playoffs where guys stepped up and did something
big, and tonight was my night.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who started Game 2 for the Padres, entered Monday's game
in the seventh inning when the Padres held a 4-2 lead. He was
making just the third relief appearance of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I had my best guy out there with a chance to win
the ballgame,'' Bochy said. ``He was rested, and I'll take my
chances there. Sure, it didn't work out, and I'll take
responsibility for that. But with Kevin out there, I have all the
confidence in the world. It didn't work out. It was a calculated
risk, but I thought it was well worth taking.''
</P>
<P>
   Bochy said he would start Brown in Game 6 if his ace feels good.
Sterling Hitchcock will face Tom Glavine if Brown is unable to
answer the bell Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres didn't go down quietly Monday in the ninth inning.
They pulled within a run of the lead on Greg Myers' two-run
pinch-hit homer off Braves closer Kerry Ligtenberg. Not wanting to
leave anything to chance, Cox sent Maddux to the mound to secure
the victory. Maddux retired three of the four batters he faced to
earn the first save of his professional career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had (Maddux) planned all night long for one hitter, maybe
two or three,'' Cox said. ``It all depended on how he looked. I'm
sure the Padres felt the same way about Brown. I thought Kevin was
throwing good. They had a great opportunity to bring him in and
close this (series) out. We got lucky, hit a ball, and it went out
of the ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-run homer was the Padres' only offense of the night. Ken
Caminiti, John Vander Wal and Myers each hit two-run dingers.
Braves starter John Smoltz served up the homers to Caminiti and
Vander Wal, but it was an otherwise good outing for Smoltz.
</P>
<P>
   Padres starter Andy Ashby clearly was working with less than his
best stuff, but he did a good job of pitching around trouble,
although he wasn't able to protect a two-run lead after the first
inning. Ashby allowed two runs on nine hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti's second home run of the series and his fifth career
postseason homer gave the Padres a 2-0 lead in the first inning.
With two out and teammate Steve Finley on first base, Caminiti
ripped a first-pitch fastball on the outside corner of the plate
down the left-field line and walked toward first base, hoping it
would stay fair.
</P>
<P>
   It did. And just like that, the Padres had seized the momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves cut the lead to a run in the fourth inning on
Tucker's RBI single to right. Cox called for a squeeze bunt in the
fourth with Smoltz at the plate and Andruw Jones at third, but the
Padres sniffed it out to keep the Braves from tying the score _ at
least for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   That changed in the sixth inning when the bottom of the Braves'
lineup put together a two-out rally. Jones singled, stole second
and scored on Tucker's base hit up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Bochy has pushed most of the right buttons during the
postseason, but his decision to let Ashby pitch to Tucker was
questionable. Had the Padres intentionally walked Tucker, they
could have faced Smoltz or forced Cox to pinch hit for his starting
pitcher. Either scenario appeared more favorable to the Padres than
pitching to Tucker, who is hitting .417 (5-for-12) in the NLCS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back, sure I wish I would have walked him if I had
known he was going to throw that kind of pitch,'' Bochy said.
</P>
<P>
   Vander Wal's dramatic home run off Smoltz in the bottom of the
sixth untied the game and put the Padres up by two runs. The crowd
of 58,988 was roaring with anticipation of a pennant-clinching
celebration, but the Braves killed those plans with their five-run
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Tucker's three-run homer in the eighth, the
Braves also scored a run on Tony Graffanino's double into the
left-field gap and another on a throwing error by Padres shortstop
Chris Gomez.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where we kind of let the game get out of hand,'' Bochy
said. ``We threw the ball away and allowed them to score that other
run. It's hard enough to overcome a one-run lead, let alone a
three-run lead. It's a tough loss, no question about it. When you
have a two-run lead and they come back on you, it's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   And with the series shifting back to Atlanta, things don't
figure to get any easier for the Padres.

WYOMING DEATH ECHOES RISING ANTI-GAY ATTACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELAINE HERSCHER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    SAN FRANCISCO _ The death of a gay University of Wyoming
student who was savagely bludgeoned and left lashed to a fence
comes at a time of growing rhetoric and violence against gays.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Matthew Shepard, 21, died early Monday after being in a coma for
nearly a week. He had been robbed, beaten and pistol-whipped in the
head so severely his skull was too crushed for surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The father of one of two accused suspects said his son told him
he committed the crime because he was embarrassed when Shepard
flirted with him in front of his friends.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-gay violence and even deaths are not new. But Shepard's
killing has touched off an intense reaction among gays and lesbians
nationwide because of its extreme brutality and timing. Shepard
lost his life at a time when describing homosexuality as a sickness
that needs curing is gaining political currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matthew Shepard's horrible suffering and death cannot be
dismissed simply as the fault of deranged, isolated individuals,''
said Beatrice Dohrn, legal director of Lambda Legal Defense and
Education Fund in New York. ``His attackers are among millions of
Americans who constantly hear the message that gay people are not
worthy of the most basic equal treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Christian right, led by the Center for Reclaiming America in
Fort Lauderdale, last summer bought a series of ads in major
newspapers claiming that love and religious teaching will ``cure''
homosexuality. The group plans to air similar television ads soon.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told a
television interviewer that homosexuality is a sin and that gay
people should be helped ``just like alcohol or sex addiction . . .
or kleptomaniacs.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 21 states, including California, have hate crime laws that
include sexual orientation. In Wyoming, three attempts to pass such
laws have failed.
</P>
<P>
   Lesbian and gay activists say that although polls show that most
Americans favor nondiscrimination, their support can erode when
laws don't protect gays, political leaders call them sinful and
religious organizations say they can change if only they tried.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no stronger testament to how toxic the
environment is that has been created by the extreme right than what
happened to Matthew Shepard,'' said Kate Kendell of the National
Center for Lesbian Rights in San Francisco. ``It is crystal clear
to lesbians and gay men in this country that hate rhetoric is
directly linked to this kind of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistics are not yet available for 1998, but hate crimes
against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people increased
nationally by 2 percent in 1997. In high schools and colleges,
violence against gays and lesbians gay youth increased a dramatic
34 percent, according to the National Coalition of Anti-Violence
Programs. The increases appear to be a combination of both a jump
in actual crimes as well as a growing readiness to report attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In another study released earlier this year by the University of
Washington, one in 10 community college students admitted to
committing hate crimes against gays. Some interviewed said an
unwanted advance or flirtation was a legitimate reason for an
assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how much more it's going to take for the right to
recognize their vitriolic rhetoric takes on actively violent
overtones in the hands of certain individuals in this country,''
Kendell said.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Folger, national director of the Center for Reclaiming
America, called the young man's death ``reprehensible'' and said
the ads were not to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main cause of the increase in violence in this country is
our having removed moral absolutes from our society and turning
away from what God would have us do,'' Folger said. ``When certain
elements in our society advocate that everyone should do what they
want to do, without any consideration of God's laws, our society
will regretfully become more violent.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard's death was a major topic of conversation in San
Francisco. At Castro and Market streets, the Castro rainbow flag
was lowered to half-staff, and mourners left impromptu memorials.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Supervisors Tom Ammiano and Mark Leno spoke
briefly about the need for ending hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's thrown into relief what I call the jihad against the gay
community,'' Ammiano said, ``from Trent Lott to those ads to the
fights against gay marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Next month, voters in Alaska and Hawaii will be asked to change
their state constitutions to keep same-sex couples from marrying.
In March 2000, if a ballot petition submitted last month qualifies,
Californians will vote on a law that bars gay marriages.

BOXER, FONG FOCUS ON GUNS, TAXES, ABORTION IN DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT B. GUNNISON and JOHN WILDERMUTH  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a spirited debate that focused on issues and
not personalities, U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer and Matt Fong, her
challenger, staked out clear differences Monday night on taxes,
abortion and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   With public opinion polls showing the race a toss-up three weeks
before the election, Democrat Boxer and Republican Fong appeared to
accomplish what they set out to do in the televised debate that ran
a few minutes shy of the hour set aside on KRON-TV.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer, a former congresswoman from Marin County, was able to
concentrate on issues she hopes will show undecided voters that she
has been a competent mainstream lawmaker with firm grasp of issues.
</P>
<P>
   Fong, the state treasurer, demonstrated he could hold his own
with a more experienced politician and avoid the jittery
performance he suffered when they met in August in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they outlined sharply diverging views of how they
would vote over the next six years in the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer defended her record as a supporter of abortion rights, the
environment and campaign finance reform. She gave a vigorous
statement for the need for government intervention in the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has ever come up to me and said, `Senator, the food is
too safe, the water is too pure, and the air is too clean,' ''
Boxer declared. ``On the contrary, they want me to work for a
cleaner environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Fong derided Boxer, who is seeking a second term, as ``a
divider,'' who ``uses fear to fight against welfare reform, tax
reform, budget reform, education reform, and even a stronger
national defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's debate, the second and probably last between the
candidates before the Nov. 3 election, was sponsored by the Voice
of the Voter project of The Chronicle, KRON-TV and KQED-FM.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of gun control clearly delineated the candidates'
differing political philosophies.
</P>
<P>
   Fong said he opposed requiring firearms to be sold with trigger
locks as a safety device. He said such a law raised the specter of
``trigger lock police.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we going to have police knocking on doors to make sure
that parents are responsible?'' he asked. Fong said he instead
backed tougher sentencing laws for criminals who use firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer shot back that she, too, backed longer sentences, but
noted that firearms are the only product made in America that do
not need to meet any safety test. ``It should come with a safety
lock,'' she said. ``Every day, 14 children are shot dead in
America. You would wish that that parent had a safety lock on that
gun.''
</P>
<P>
   About taxes, Fong defended his support for a so-called flat tax,
although he was less than direct when answering whether a single
mother earning $40,000 would pay more taxes than someone who sold
$1 million of stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would have taxing of income, but only once,'' Fong offered
in his rambling response, before saying the mother would pay
``very, very little.'' But he also admitted the millionaire would
have to pay taxes only the first time the money was earned, not on
capital gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you live off daddy's inheritance,'' Boxer said, ``you pay
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   They differed, too, on campaign finance, with Fong endorsing
full disclosure, but no limits on campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters can hold us accountable,'' he said. ``That is the way
we can best deal with campaign reform.''
</P>
<P>
   But Boxer stoutly defended the McCain-Feingold bill that died in
the Senate last month, killed by the GOP majority. The bill would
have banned so-called soft money contributions that led to the
campaign-financing abuses in the 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would also curb the increasingly popular
practice of independent groups' running advertisements praising or
attacking candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Fong, you have to reform the cancer that is on our
campaign system,'' Boxer said. ``Even if we are the most honest
people in the world, if it has the appearance of a conflict of
interest, it is not good for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   She noted that Fong returned a $100,000 contribution from
Indonesia businessman Ted Sioeng, who cannot contribute legally
because he is not a U.S. citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Fong has insisted that he did not know the contributions made to
his 1994 campaign for treasurer were illegal.
</P>
<P>
   After the debate, Fong said, ``I was trying to stay on the
issues and focus on the clear differences between us.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer, he said, ``focused on fear.'' He added, ``She distorted
her record, she distorted my record.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer saw her more aggressive debate tactics in a much different
light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm engaging in the politics of truth,'' she said. ``When my
opponent checks off a box saying he doesn't support any new gun
laws, . . . it seems to me people ought to know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said the debate will only help her in the final three
weeks of the campaign. ``Anyone watching tonight would see that
there is a real clear choice,'' she said. ``It's not about who's
got the best personality or who's the best debater.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a Field Poll last week that showed Fong taking the lead
in the campaign, Boxer said the race remains too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   While the Senate remains in session, Boxer said she will
campaign full time unless she's forced to return to Washington for
a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to campaign and get out there with people,'' she
said. ``It's the part I love the best.''

flirted with him in front of his friends.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-gay violence and even deaths are not new. But Shepard's
killing has touched off an intense reaction among gays and lesbians
nationwide because of its extreme brutality and timing. Shepard
lost his life at a time when describing homosexuality as a sickness
that needs curing is gaining political currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matthew Shepard's horrible suffering and death cannot be
dismissed simply as the fault of deranged, isolated individuals,''
said Beatrice Dohrn, legal director of Lambda Legal Defense and
Education Fund in New York. ``His attackers are among millions of
Americans who constantly hear the message that gay people are not
worthy of the most basic equal treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Christian right, led by the Center for Reclaiming America in
Fort Lauderdale, last summer bought a series of ads in major
newspapers claiming that love and religious teaching will ``cure''
homosexuality. The group plans to air similar television ads soon.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told a
television interviewer that homosexuality is a sin and that gay
people should be helped ``just like alcohol or sex addiction . . .
or kleptomaniacs.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 21 states, including California, have hate crime laws that
include sexual orientation. In Wyoming, three attempts to pass such
laws have failed.
</P>
<P>
   Lesbian and gay activists say that although polls show that most
Americans favor nondiscrimination, their support can erode when
laws don't protect gays, political leaders call them sinful and
religious organizations say they can change if only they tried.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no stronger testament to how toxic the
environment is that has been created by the extreme right than what
happened to Matthew Shepard,'' said Kate Kendell of the National
Center for Lesbian Rights in San Francisco. ``It is crystal clear
to lesbians and gay men in this country that hate rhetoric is
directly linked to this kind of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistics are not yet available for 1998, but hate crimes
against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people increased
nationally by 2 percent in 1997. In high schools and colleges,
violence against gays and lesbians gay youth increased a dramatic
34 percent, according to the National Coalition of Anti-Violence
Programs. The increases appear to be a combination of both a jump
in actual crimes as well as a growing readiness to report attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In another study released earlier this year by the University of
Washington, one in 10 community college students admitted to
committing hate crimes against gays. Some interviewed said an
unwanted advance or flirtation was a legitimate reason for an
assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how much more it's going to take for the right to
recognize their vitriolic rhetoric takes on actively violent
overtones in the hands of certain individuals in this country,''
Kendell said.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Folger, national director of the Center for Reclaiming
America, called the young man's death ``reprehensible'' and said
the ads were not to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main cause of the increase in violence in this country is
our having removed moral absolutes from our society and turning
away from what God would have us do,'' Folger said. ``When certain
elements in our society advocate that everyone should do what they
want to do, without any consideration of God's laws, our society
will regretfully become more violent.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard's death was a major topic of conversation in San
Francisco. At Castro and Market streets, the Castro rainbow flag
was lowered to half-staff, and mourners left impromptu memorials.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Supervisors Tom Ammiano and Mark Leno spoke
briefly about the need for ending hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's thrown into relief what I call the jihad against the gay
community,'' Ammiano said, ``from Trent Lott to those ads to the
fights against gay marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Next month, voters in Alaska and Hawaii will be asked to change
their state constitutions to keep same-sex couples from marrying.
In March 2000, if a ballot petition submitted last month qualifies,
Californians will vote on a law that bars gay marriages.

TODAY'S PAPERS: PAGE 1 DIGEST FOR OCT. 13. 
</HEADLINE>
  By SCOTT SHUGER 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   USA Today, the Los Angeles Times and the New York Times lead
with Slobodan Milosevic's promise to withdraw his forces from
Kosovo in the face of threatened NATO airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post lead covers Congress' latest moves in its
attempts to arrive at a budget, stressing the tentative approval by
key House and Senate Republicans of President Clinton's requested
$18 billion for the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   The death of the gay student who was kidnapped and beaten in
Wyoming grabs front space at the NYT, LAT and USAT, and is the
subject of the NYT's lead editorial, which points out that Wyoming,
like nine other states, has no hate-crime laws.
</P>
<P>
   The papers report that even though Milosevic agreed to back out
of Kosovo, NATO Monday authorized air strikes against him that
could begin in four days if he doesn't actually do that. They also
report that in the meantime, about 2,000 airborne and ground-based
allied inspectors _ including some American civilians and, say the
LAT and NYT, some Russians _ will verify that Milosevic's Serbian
troops have indeed pulled back, allowing Albanians to return to
their homes. If this doesn't happen, the NATO air plan to be
implemented would begin with cruise missiles and progress to a full
bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The LAT says that each stage of the plan could be flown only
after being approved by NATO's ambassadors (something the NYT says
is not clear) and that only military facilities would be targeted.
The NYT account stresses more than the others the resistance of the
Russians to the air strike plan.
</P>
<P>
   The WP reports that House Republicans have extracted something
in return for infusion of fresh U.S. billions into coffers of the
International Monetary Fund: 1) a promise by major IMF contributors
to push the agency to require above-market rates and reasonably
short repayment periods for its loans (to lessen high-risk
borrowing in aided countries); 2) a requirement that the IMF
release written summaries of its board meetings and other major
documents within three months.
</P>
<P>
   The WP also says that the White House and the Hill are close on
a number of the remaining budget issues, including a Clinton plan
to spend $1.1 billion to hire 100,000 new teachers. But since
agreements have not yet been reached, Congress passed another
short-term funding bill _ the third since October 1st _ to tide the
government over for a few more days.
</P>
<P>
   Another budget story on the Post front addresses the 30 or so
line items that appear in print for the first time in the $250
billion defense bill Congress just passed _ so-called ``virgin
births.'' The list this year, reports the Post, includes $250,000
to study the tactical applications of caffeinated chewing gum.
</P>
<P>
   The papers report that the Nobel Prize in Medicine goes this
year to three Americans who discovered that nitric oxide (not, the
papers admonish, nitrous oxide, which is laughing gas), known best
as an air pollutant, is also produced in the body, where it
regulates blood pressure, nerve firing, and immune responses. The
Post waits until the third paragraph of its story to mention that
nitric oxide is central to the process of getting an erection and
as such is a key element in the workings of Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   At the NYT, erections make the second paragraph, Viagra the
fifth. At the LAT Viagra makes the second paragraph, erections the
18th.
</P>
<P>
   A Wall Street Journal front-page feature cites a strong consumer
trend: the young children of boomers have buying habits that
formerly were associated with adolescents. The piece quotes a
finding that while aggregate spending by or on behalf of children
4-12 roughly doubled every decade between 1960-1980, in the 1990s,
it has tripled. The money goes, says the Journal, to such surprises
as fitness clubs and personal trainers, Delta Airlines
pre-schoolers fliers club and Liberty Financial's mutual fund for
children, which features a quarterly coloring book and a savings
and investing bingo game.
</P>
<P>
   One suspicion-raising feature of the story: the three cities
mentioned in vignettes are all upper-upper-end nearly-pure-white
towns within 50 miles of Los Angeles.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Like a typical 3-year-old, my daughter Amy planned for Halloween
with gusto. She chose her own costume _ a purple leotard and a tutu
_ and wore it every day for weeks before the big event. She could
hardly wait to fill an entire bag with candy!
</P>
<P>
   Little did I know that Amy's Halloween would not be all smiles.
One minute she was shouting, ``Trick or treat!'' and the next she
was petrified of a teen-age witch we saw on our block.
</P>
<P>
   She flew into my arms, sobbing, ``I'm so scared!'' and demanding
to go home to Daddy.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed that our fun was ending so abruptly, I took Amy
home. As it turned out, she had a much better time greeting
trick-or-treaters at our door than she had venturing out into
unfamiliar Halloween country.
</P>
<P>
   I shouldn't have been so surprised by my daughter's reaction.
``It's not unusual for a 3-year-old to be overwhelmed on
Halloween,'' notes Ava Siegler, a child psychologist in New York
City and a contributing editor to Child magazine. ``Toddlers and
many preschoolers don't yet have the firm boundaries that help them
differentiate between what's real and what's pretend, making it
difficult for them to see scary things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Young children often don't like to be surprised,'' adds Karen
Marschke, a developmental specialist at the Corlears School in New
York City. ``They can't easily place new experiences into a context
that they understand, and this can leave them feeling confused and
upset.''
</P>
<P>
   How much Halloween excitement is appropriate for young kids? It
depends on your child's age and developmental stage.
</P>
<P>
   Babies are oblivious to what's going on; it's kids between 1 and
5 who are at risk of becoming frightened by what they're exposed to
on Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   But even more essential than following age guidelines is
``taking into account your child's temperament and personality,''
notes Marschke. While an outgoing toddler may thrive on the
excitement, one who's slow to warm up or easily upset would benefit
from a more cautious approach.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Toddlers &LR; :
</P>
<P>
   Keep it low key. Kids under age 3 are really not ready to go
trick-or-treating yet; they will feel much safer at home with you.
Many don't even enjoy the dressing-up part, since they often find
costumes constricting. It's important for you to keep expectations
reasonable and to plan activities that are short and predictable,
like a Halloween puppet show.
</P>
<P>
   If your child wants to dress up, a quick trip to a relative's
house to show off her costume is enough.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Preschoolers &LR; :
</P>
<P>
   Stay flexible. Children age 3 and older can better understand
the concept of pretend versus real, and are therefore ready to get
more involved in Halloween activities, including trick-or-treating.
But remember that even preschoolers can have a wide range of
reactions to Halloween _ from delight to terror.
</P>
<P>
   Before the big day, prepare your child for what's to come. Look
at costumes in a store, pointing out that people will be wearing
them. Say, ``This is a day when kids put on funny or scary outfits.
You'll see some ghosts and witches, but remember that underneath
each costume is a little boy like you,'' says Siegler.
</P>
<P>
   When planning activities, remember shorter is better. Limit
trick-or-treating to a few close friends or neighbors, so your
child doesn't get overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how much you prepare, if on the big day your child
still seems frightened, then you need to accept that he's not ready
yet. ``Parents have to determine how much of this holiday is for
them _ because they want to see their child dressed as a pumpkin _
and how much of it kids really enjoy,'' adds Siegler. ``Halloween
is not just about a photo-op. It's a children's holiday, so if they
are not having fun, don't celebrate it.''
</P>
<P>
   If you follow your child's cues and stay flexible, Halloween
will be an adventure to remember. And when he's ready, you'll snap
photos galore.

<TEXT>
<P>
   There's no doubt about it: For kids, Halloween is incredibly
exciting. But it's also potentially dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Safe Kids Campaign (NSKC) in
Washington, D.C., children under age 15 are four times more likely
to be hurt in a pedestrian accident on Halloween than on any other
night of the year. Injuries from falls and burns are common, too.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that there are some simple ways to keep your
kids safe without taking any of the fun out of the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what you need to know:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Think ahead &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A week or so before the big event, start talking about Halloween
safety, and be sure to communicate your rules clearly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are most likely to act impulsively when they're highly
stimulated,'' says Janette Benson, associate professor of
psychology at the University of Denver. ``Because they are so
focused on their goal _ in this case, the candy-they don't stop to
think before they act.''
</P>
<P>
   Take time to go over the rules when your children can focus on
what you're saying, then give a reminder on Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Shop wisely &LR; :
</P>
<P>
   Fires are the third-leading cause of accidental deaths among
children. So when you're assembling a costume:
</P>
<P>
   Look for masks, hats, wigs and clothing labeled ``flame
resistant.''
</P>
<P>
   Avoid outfits that have billowing material, long capes, or baggy
sleeves that could catch fire if brushed against candles or fit
jack-o'-lanterns.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dress for safety &LR; :
</P>
<P>
   Nothing takes the fun out of trick-or-treat time faster than a
Halloween ``boo''-boo caused by a slip or a fall. Be sure to:
</P>
<P>
   Hem your kids' costumes to mid-calf length or shorter to prevent
stumbles.
</P>
<P>
   Secure hats and wigs so they don't slip child down and block
your child's vision.
</P>
<P>
   Forget Mom's heels or Dad's boots, no matter how cute they look.
Choose comfy shoes with nonskid soles instead.
</P>
<P>
   Consider using face paint or makeup instead of a mask, which can
obstruct vision. If a mask is a must, cut the eye holes wide enough
so your child can see clearly in all directions.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Boost visibility &LR; :
</P>
<P>
   Make sure trick-or-treaters can still see and be seen when the
sun goes down.
</P>
<P>
   Use bright or light-colored costumes that can be spotted easily
by drivers. Add color to all-black outfits by persuading your child
to wear fluorescent tights. And give your child a flashlight to
help her navigate.
</P>
<P>
   Secure reflective tape or stickers to costumes (brands
identified as ``retro-reflective'' work the best).
</P>
<P>
   If you can't incorporate reflective tape into your child's
costume, put some on her shoes or treat bag.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Devise a game plan &LR; :
</P>
<P>
   Before you set out trick-or-treating with kids, map a route of
familiar homes to visit and set a time limit. Get an early start
with young kids so you can be home before it's too dark.
</P>
<P>
   Remind kids not to dart into the street or cross between parked
cars-a risk when they're overexcited.
</P>
<P>
   Tell them to stop at corners and look left, right and left
before crossing.
</P>
<P>
   Evaluate your child's maturity before letting him trick-or-treat
without you. Most kids under 10 aren't ready to go it alone, says
Dr. Marilyn J. Bull, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics'
section on injury and poison prevention.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Check the loot &LR; :
</P>
<P>
   Halloween's a time for treats, but be cautious. Inspect all
candy before kids start snacking, and throw out anything
suspicious, says Pam Kreppel, a registered dietitian at Nassau
County Medical Center in East Meadow, N.Y. Toss cracked or crushed
candies and items with loose or tipped wrappers.
</P>
<P>
   Remove treats that pose a choking hazard to kids under 4, warns
Kreppel. These include chewy candies with nuts or caramel; round,
hard candies; lollipops; and small, loose treats like gum balls.
Safer bets are plain chocolate bars, pretzels, or chocolate-covered
wafers.

<P>
   True, it's no trip to Disneyland. But taking your kids to the
grocery store can be fun _ and educational. Try these tips the next
time you're low on milk and bread:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Before you go &LR; : &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Create a ``just for kids'' project to shop for. Whether you're
making a lemonade stand, cutting stamps from potatoes or creating a
shaving-cream sculpture, ask your child to add the necessary
supplies to the grocery list. Looking for ``her'' special items
will help keep interest high.
</P>
<P>
   Plan ahead. Schedule your trip when everyone is well-rested. And
eat a healthy snack before you go to brighten everyone's mood and
make that candy aisle a little more resistible.
</P>
<P>
   Ask questions. On the way to the store, talk about your grocery
list. Ask younger children ``What shape are oranges?'' and ``What
color is a box of Cheerios?'' Recognizing shapes, colors and logos
is a great pre-reading exercise.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; At the store &LR; : &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Look for kid-sized carts. Many stores now have carts sized just
for the younger set. Your child will have fun adding ``his'' items
to his own cart.
</P>
<P>
   Give your child choices. Asking ``Should we get peas or green
beans?'' teaches decision-making skills and makes your child feel
important.
</P>
<P>
   Make learning fun. Preschoolers love to match items with
coupons. Once you're in the correct aisle, give your child a hint
about where the item is. Older kids can help compare unit prices to
find the best value.
</P>
<P>
   Use your senses. Younger kids are eager to learn about shapes,
textures and smells. Let them help you fill a bag with apples.
Teach them how to ``thump'' a cantaloupe and listen to the sound.
Smell the lemons together. Encourage your child to use all her
senses.
</P>
<P>
   Goof off! Wave at babies in passing carts. Make up a song about
bananas. With older kids, fun often equals challenge. Ask them
``How many different vegetables can you name in one minute?'' or
``If you ran your own store, what would you sell?''
</P>
<P>
   Teach money management. You may want to allow an older child to
spend a set amount of money on a treat. Learning to wisely spend a
limited amount of money is good lesson for every child. Even
better: Stop by the magazines or the children's book area and allow
your child to choose an item.

<P>
   Keep little hands busy. Older children can put away
non-breakable items. For added fun, have them play ``beat the
clock'' with a kitchen timer. By asking younger kids to ``put all
the vegetables in a pile'' or ``stack all the paper products by the
closet,'' you're teaching important concepts _ while giving
yourself time to put the ice cream in the freezer.
</P>
<P>
   Reward yourselves! Whether it's enjoying a cup of cocoa at the
kitchen table or making those potato stamps, take 15 minutes with
your kids to unwind and say thanks for a job well done!

<P>
   NEW YORK _ What has 30,000 slightly crazed participants, more
than 2 million spectators and 40 bands along miles of streets all
over New York City?
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Marathon, of course, with this year's 29th
running Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   But the race is not just for New Yorkers. About half of the
American participants, from 7,000 to 10,000 men and women, come
from elsewhere in the United States. Another 10,000 are foreign
runners; last year 95 other countries were represented, led by
France, Germany and Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   As this mass of humanity spreads along the route, runners see
parts of New York that many natives never see in their lifetimes,
let alone in one day. And runners are cheered on by spectators
sometimes 10 deep along the sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in Staten Island, the race goes through Brooklyn,
Queens, into Manhattan, briefly into the Bronx and back into
Manhattan, finishing after 26.2 miles at Tavern on the Green in
Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   Lately the scene at the 10:40 a.m. start has been a wild one. So
many runners throng the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge that many have to
walk the first mile, with times running as long as 10 minutes. On
the plus side: In clear weather from the bridge's mid-point runners
have a spectacular view of the city, one you'll never get from a
tour bus and perhaps not even from an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Each neighborhood has its history and quirks. Staten Island is
New York's forgotten borough and home of a succession movement.
Brooklyn, founded in 1636, was New York's rival until its
annexation 100 years ago. Queens was named for Catherine Brahanza,
King Charles II's queen. The Bronx is home (for now) of the New
York Yankees (an election will decide the fate of a stadium
proposed for Manhattan's West Side). And to reach that finish line
in Manhattan is, as the song goes, ``to be a part of it, New York,
New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Finishing is the best part of the marathon. The worst, of
course, is hitting The Wall, too often the fate of runners who get
caught up in pre-race excitement. The best advice for average
runners is go out slow, remain steady and save something for the
end.
</P>
<P>
   The wall of fatigue is usually found in the Bronx around the
20-mile mark. The crowds are sparse; the elite runners have already
finished. It's you and the road, and you have to tough it out
mentally to keep going.
</P>
<P>
   Here you might regret having told yourself beforehand, I have to
do three hours or a personal best. Finishing is an accomplishment
in itself.
</P>
<P>
   (I know firsthand. In my first and only marathon, I ran New York
at age 40. My goal was breaking three hours. At the end, I was
happy just to cross the finish line, at three hours 41 minutes.)
</P>
<P>
   For your efforts, there's a medal and a long look back at what
you accomplished. And, in passing, a streetwise tour of the five
boroughs. Better than a tourist bus any day.

 Color slides and black and white photos of Oprah Winfrey in
``Beloved'' are available. 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    She's one of the richest entertainers in history. A force of
nature whose fortune Forbes magazine estimates at $675 million.
There is little doubt Oprah Winfrey will become America's first
black billionaire.
 &HT;    Now she wants the world to take a long hard look at slavery, not
from the outside as Steven Spielberg did in last year's
unsuccessful ``Amistad,'' but from the inside _ the inside of Sethe
the slave in Toni Morrison's story ``Beloved'' (Plume, 1994).
 &HT;    ``It was doing this movie that took me to the reality behind the
words of _ (she starts to sing) _ 'Before I'll be a slave, I'll be
buried in my grave.'''
 &HT;    Moments before, she had bounced into a hotel in Chicago, looking
drop-dead gorgeous. On the current cover of Vogue she looks like a
high fashion model, dressed completely in brown, accented by a
razzle-dazzle gold watch and a pair of spectacular diamond
earrings.
 &HT;    Born to unmarried teenagers in Mississippi, Winfrey never
struggled for anything so much in life as to make ``Beloved'' into
a movie. She spent 10 years trying to bring the story to the
screen, discovering in the process, she says, ``the real meaning of
life.''
 &HT;    Somehow in the story of Sethe who kills her infant daughter to
save her from slavery, Winfrey sees herself. ``I felt when I read
this book, that I was Sethe and that Sethe was me,'' she said,
``and that we were all connected somehow. I was stunned and
overwhelmed and couldn't even articulate what I was feeling.''
 &HT;    She's seen the completed movie many times but every time it has
the same effect on her. ``I need a lobotomy after it,'' she laughs.
``I am just hysterical, crying every time like I'd never been in
the movie, like I hadn't lived it for 10 years. I couldn't believe
my own emotion.''
 &HT;    There were days when she was so upset that director Jonathan
Demme had to give her the day off. ``I was crying and crying and
crying,'' she said. ``Finally Jonathan said, 'We're gonna turn the
camera around on Danny (Danny Glover who plays slave Paul D) and
just let you cry it out. And we'll come back tomorrow and shoot
you.'''
 &HT;    Making the film, she insists, changed her focus on life. She was
tired. She has palatial homes: on the lake in Chicago, on a
160-acre spread in Indiana, on an 85-acre ranch in Telluride Colo.
So who needs the grind of a daily TV show?
 &HT;    ``After 'Beloved' I thought, who wants to be sitting everyday
working on a talk show? I was gonna free myself. But getting to the
realization of what slavery was, I thought, how dare I think tired?
I come from a people who had no shoes, I come from a people who did
not know which way north was, who didn't have milk for their
children. So how dare I with all my square footage and all my Prada
shoes think that I'm tired and need a rest?''
 &HT;    All her life the 44-year-old Winfrey has been a dreamer, always
knowing there was more in store for her than poverty and a
dysfunctional family. ``I remember sitting on the linoleum floor in
Milwaukee when I was 10 watching the Oscars. I never missed that
show and Sydney Poitier won for ``Lilies of the Field.'' And then
something clicked in me that said, 'A colored man did that. I can
too.'''
 &HT;    But even when she started in broadcasting at a small radio
station in Nashville, Tenn., she could not possibly have imagined
reaching icon status.
 &HT;    ``What's it like to be an icon?'' she mocks in a singsong voice.
``I didn't even know what an icon was till a couple of years ago.
Because your perception of yourself is not based on what other
people think of you. Like that Vogue cover. I know I spent two days
working with them on it. But that's not how I see myself.''
 &HT;    The best part of it all, Winfrey says, is when she feels
genuinely loved and appreciated by her audience.
 &HT;    ``Growing up I wanted to be Diana Ross. And you know you're
always looking at other people, thinking, if I could just be that,
or if I could have her hair. And then one day a woman in Midland,
Texas, wrote me a letter saying, 'Watching you be yourself every
day makes me want to be more of myself.'
 &HT;    ``I think I want that on my tombstone.''

SHARON STONE GOES UNGLAMOROUS IN 'THE MIGHTY'

 Color slides and black and white photos of Sharon Stone, Kieran
Culkin and other actors in scenes from ``The Mighty.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Interviewing Sharon Stone these days comes with a built-in
warning _ not to mention a beefy bodyguard and a publicist poised
at her shoulder.
 &HT;    Three hours before Stone showed up for our interview at Beverly
Hills' Four Seasons Hotel her publicist marched into the room,
denied published stories that said Sharon was pregnant and warned,
``If you ask any questions about the pregnancy or her marriage the
interview will end right there. ''
 &HT;    When Sharon eventually showed up she looked gorgeous as always
but seemed something less than exuberant, admitting, ``I'm tired.
I'm fighting a cold. I always get this way when I do publicity
tours.''
 &HT;    Stone's mission was to talk up a storm about ``The Mighty,'' a
film in which she plays the unglamorous mother of a severely
handicapped young son, played by 15-year-old Kieran Culkin, younger
brother of McCauley Culkin.
 &HT;    It's a warm, sad tale about two boys handicapped in different
ways who use their imaginations and fondness for the legend of King
Arthur to forge a remarkable friendship.
 &HT;    The picture _ a hit at Cannes this spring, also stars Gena
Rowlands, Harry Dean Stanton and ``X-Files''' Gillian Anderson in
an offbeat role as a loose, boozy broad.
 &HT;    But it's Stone who must sell the picture. She talks slowly and
without much fire, but looks pretty sensational in a gray cashmere
sweater and knee-high blue denim skirt, her blonde hair cut ultra
short _ ``I chopped it all off myself in a wild moment,'' she
explains.
 &HT;    ``Mighty'' director Peter Chelsom (``Hear My Song,'' 1991) says
when Stone read the script and agreed to play the plain-Jane role
he cautioned, ``Are you prepared to come as you are? You don't get
any special lighting or foggy filters for your shots.''
 &HT;    Stone, who also produced the picture, agreed; Chelsom says, ``It
was a commendable, noble ... and very intelligent thing for her to
do.''
 &HT;    The star herself makes light of the fact that Sharon Stone,
reigning Hollywood sex symbol should play a working-class mom. The
sexy image, she insists, is something male journalists have stuck
her with.
 &HT;    ``I wasn't exactly glamorous in `Last Dance,' was I?'' she
challenges, and indeed she did play a death row inmate in that 1996
picture. But it's difficult to forget that she zoomed her way to
the top of Hollywood's must-hire list after her role as the
psychopathic seductress opposite Michael Douglas in ``Basic
Instinct'' (1992).
 &HT;    Making ``The Mighty'' was different: ``I was impaled by the
emotion of this film,'' she says.
 &HT;    There have of course been big changes in her life in the last
year. For starters she got married, last Valentine's Day, to San
Francisco newspaper editor Phil Bronstein which caused her, she
says, to put less emphasis on her career.
 &HT;    It also brought her another home. In addition to the house she
owns in an upscale Los Angeles suburb, she now lives with her
husband in a high-rise apartment in San Francisco. And while Stone
wants to avoid motherhood and marriage topics, she did recount a
scary incident which took place a few weeks ago in the skyscraper
in the city by the bay.
 &HT;    The actress was trapped in an elevator for two hours between the
20th and 21st floors. She used her cell phone to call Bronstein,
who rushed to the building and talked her through the ordeal before
emergency rescue crews smashed their way to her from the adjacent
building and pulled her to safety.
 &HT;    ``The day after the rescue,'' Stone recalls, ``I fell apart when
I realized that the elevator could have crashed to earth and I
would have ended up an oil stain on the concrete. But strangely,
going through something like that brought Phil and I much closer
together. The rescue people were telling me to do one thing that
went against my gut instinct _ and Phil supported me by saying, 'Do
what you think is right.'''
 &HT;    Stone says she has become a regular housefrau and likes nothing
better than to bake up batches of cookies for her husband to take
to the guys on the paper. She's also developed a liking for writing
and has penned several short stories. ``I took a few lessons on how
to use a computer and finally was able to shop for three pairs of
jeans on the Internet. But it's not for me so Phil finally bought
me an old-fashioned typewriter.''
 &HT;    Besides ``The Mighty,'' she also stars opposite Woody Allen as
the voice of the princess in Dreamworks' new hit movie ``Antz.''
 &HT;    ``That was great,'' she says. ``I was able to do the voice-over
work in San Francisco without having to dress up in costume or
spend hours in a makeup chair.''
 &HT;    Her re-marriage and the fact that she hopes to become a mother,
says Stone, helped her weather turning 40 in March. (Her marriage
to producer Michael Greenberg ended after three years in l987.)
 &HT;    ``I often picked the wrong guy,'' she admits. ``I had problems
finding the right man simply because I never considered myself very
lovable. When boys came to my house when I was growing up it was to
see my younger sister Kelly. I was the ugly duckling in our family,
a real geek at high school. I had no sense of myself as a woman.''
 &HT;    But all that has changed since she met the macho Bronstein after
coming to San Francisco to star in this year's science fiction
movie ``Sphere.'' The film flopped but the romance blossomed.
Bronstein, say his friends, is a confident man with a strong sense
of his own identity who doesn't worry about becoming Mr. Sharon
Stone.
 &HT;    And he has certainly changed her perspective. ``I used to be in
love with my job _ and now I'm in love with my life and like my
job,'' says Stone. ``Stardom isn't the fuel of my soul any more.''

 &HT;    NEW GENDER GAP EMERGING IN TECH EDUCATION, REPORT SAYS
 &HT;    Repeating in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Technology has become the new ``boys' club'' in
America's public schools, says a study that recommends renewed
efforts to provide girls with an equal education.
</P>
<P>
   The study released Wednesday, a sequel to the landmark 1992
report ``How Schools Shortchange Girls,'' noted that gaps in math
and science achievement have narrowed for girls in the past six
years, only to be replaced by an emerging gap in the use of
computer technology.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that 29 percent of boys took computer science
courses in 1994, compared to 24 percent of girls. More
significantly, the boys were more likely to learn computer
applications while the girls were concentrated in data entry
courses _ ``the 1990s version of typing,'' said Janice Weinman,
executive director of the American Association of University Women
(AAUW).
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is now the new boys' club in our nation's public
schools,'' added Weinman, whose organization's educational
foundation commissioned both the new study, ``Gender Gaps: Where
Schools Still Fail Our Children,'' and the 1992 report.
</P>
<P>
   With school districts having invested millions of dollars in
wiring schools for computer technology since 1992, ``a discouraging
new gap is emerging,'' threatening to make women ``bystanders in
the technological 21st century,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do girls make up a smaller percentage of students in
computer science courses, but they also use computers less often
outside of school, it said. And they encounter fewer powerful,
active female role models in computer games and software, it added.
</P>
<P>
   The report recommended more research to develop technology
programs that are ``challenging and equitable and ... encourage
both girls and boys to see themselves as imaginative and
collaborative 'power users' of technology.''
</P>
<P>
   It also recommended that schools do more to encourage girls to
take science and math courses, even to the point of making some of
them mandatory for all students.
</P>
<P>
   The report also found evidence that school-to-work programs,
launched by some school districts since 1992 to give students a
taste of ``real world'' careers, have had ``limited success'' in
steering girls into non-traditionally female occupations. Such
career preparation programs ``often fail to live up to their
promise,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the new report found that girls have made
significant progress in academic achievement since 1992 and
``probably receive a fairer education today than in 1992.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made some significant strides in leveling the learning
and playing fields for girls,'' said Maggie Ford, president of the
AAUW Educational Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the gender gap in physics has narrowed
dramatically. In 1990, 27 percent of boys took physics, compared to
17 percent of girls. In 1994, it was 28 percent of boys and 22
percent of girls.
</P>
<P>
   But while girls outnumber boys in most advanced placement
classes, especially in English and foreign languages, they continue
to trail in such courses as chemistry and calculus, major
predictors of success in college.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the profound demographic changes under way in the
country, the report also alerted policy-makers to the prospect of
more pronounced gaps in the future based on racial, ethnic,
economic and regional differences.
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic population, projected to reach 59 million by 2030,
poses a special dilemma because of its unusually high dropout rate,
which has hovered at about 30 percent. Although Hispanics value
education, the report noted, they value family even more and are
willing to forgo an education in order to help their family
economically.
</P>
<P>
   The report recommended government efforts to discourage Hispanic
girls from dropping out of school. ``It is crucial that girls in
this population receive an education that doesn't limit them to
unskilled, subsistence and seasonal or contingent jobs,'' it said.

   The Hispanic population, projected to reach 59 million by 2030,
poses a special dilemma because of its unusually high dropout rate,
which has hovered at about 30 percent. Although Hispanics value
education, the report noted, they value family even more and are
willing to forgo an education in order to help their family
economically.
</P>
<P>
   The report recommended government efforts to discourage Hispanic
girls from dropping out of school. ``It is crucial that girls in
this population receive an education that doesn't limit them to
unskilled, subsistence and seasonal or contingent jobs,'' it said.

PRESIDENT MAKES INDIAN EDUCATION A TOP PRIORITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is

 c.1998 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Aug. 6, President Clinton issued Executive Order 13096
concerning American Indian and Alaska Native Education. The
president's initiative targets the serious problems plaguing Indian
schooling _ dropout rates and substance abuse. The first
federal-tribal conference on education under the executive order
opened in Nashville, Tenn., this past weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The president's initiative not only mandates cooperation among
federal agencies and dialogue with tribal leaders, it opens an
essential pathway to the budget process.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly half-a-million American Indian students from
kindergarten through high school have the highest dropout rate of
any group in the nation. More than 25 percent of the American
Indian/Alaska Native students who should have graduated in 1992
dropped out of school.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 90 percent of Indian students attend public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 190 tribal schools across this country are in
terrible disrepair. And those public schools, which are built on
tribal lands, have never really addressed the cultural needs of
Indian students.
</P>
<P>
   In the past there has been little cooperation between Head Start
programs serving Indian children and tribal schools, and less
cooperation between public schools on tribal land and tribal
schools. In the hodgepodge of federal, state, and local educational
programs, Indian students often fall between the cracks.
</P>
<P>
   Section 1 of Clinton's order sets the goals: ``The federal
government has a special, historic responsibility for the education
of American Indian and Alaska Native students. Improving
educational achievement and academic progress for American Indian
and Alaska Native students is vital to the national goal of
preparing every student for responsible citizenship, continued
learning, and productive employment.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive order creates a task force and sets deadlines. The
17-member task force represents 15 federal departments and
agencies, including the U.S. Department of Education, the
Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and
the Department Health and Human Services. It will consult with
tribes, the National Congress of American Indians, the National
Indian Education Association and the National Advisory Council on
Indian Education. By August 2000, the task force must have
developed a comprehensive federal Indian education policy.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Gover, who has headed the BIA for nearly a year, called
the executive order an initiative to develop a strategy for dealing
with educational problems in several areas _ ``to reduce the
dropout rate and to address some of the social problems that are
facing Indian children, having to do with drug and alcohol abuse
and domestic violence. And a third, that's sort of a
chicken-and-egg proposition _ we want to improve their performance
in science, math and English.''
</P>
<P>
   Gover explained the importance of presidential executive orders:
``What we find in almost any subject area is that there are a
number of agencies that have resources which can be brought to
bear, but only rarely does the federal government coordinate its
efforts so that we combine our resources or unify our approach to
particular problems. An executive order puts the power of the
president behind an effort to do that sort of policy or resource
coordination. That alone often will improve situations even without
the expenditure of new money.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the president says something is a priority, then all
sorts of doors begin to open. One of the doors we need to really
kick open is in the budget process. We know we've got over a
billion dollars of needed construction in the BIA school system.
And getting the kind of commitment we need at the beginning of the
budget process from the Office of Management and Budget becomes
considerably easier when we are able to say `Indian education is a
presidential priority.' Quite often it has symbolic significance
that translates into real political clout.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we're so pleased that the president would turn his
attention to Indian education.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton order pushes other federal agencies to recognize
their responsibilities to the tribes and prods them to make their
resources available. Certainly, the U.S. Department of Education
has a great many more educational resources than the BIA. And now
those resources can be tapped.
</P>
<P>
   Melody McCoy, staff attorney for Native American Rights Fund in
Boulder, Colo., says tribal organizations had worked on the
fundamentals of this education initiative since 1994. Their
recommendations were presented to Clinton in March 1997. The
executive order adopted much of their comprehensive policy
statement. ``That's fast, as government action goes,'' said McCoy.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal control over Indian education is a pivotal concept in
this initiative, according to McCoy. Public schools on Indian
reservations need to take into account they are on Indian land and
be more attuned to tribal culture, mores and social problems, she
said. The agenda in these schools is not set by Indians and should
be. Educational goals are imposed from outside tribal culture.
McCoy sees the executive order as an important step toward
improving Indian education through Indian leadership.
</P>
<P>
   It has long been recognized that students of a distinct minority
culture suffer when thrust into schools which only reflect the
values of the majority culture. For them, success in school
represents a failure of their own community; failure in school,
however, becomes success in the community and preservation of their
culture. Tragically, children in such a situation are often forced
to choose one culture over another.
</P>
<P>
   And lose, whichever path they pick.
</P>
<P>
   This tribal-inspired education initiative was needed a hundred
years ago. It deserves the full support of Congress, federal
agencies and the voters.

   FURNITURE _ HIGH POINT, N.C. _ You may not be able to afford an
exotic getaway, but that doesn't mean you have to miss out on the
travel. Furniture manufacturers have found a clever way to get you
to spend money at home instead of at the airport. They're designing
pieces inspired by places that will take you, vicariously, around
the world. And it doesn't hurt when a famous person's name is
attached _ a trend in itself among the thousands of manufacturers
who show their newest pieces each spring and fall at the world's
largest wholesale furniture exposition in High Point, N.C.
Thomasville Furniture Industries, for example, will introduce the
Ernest Hemingway Collection, inspired by places where the famed

   BREAST _ Evelyn Gresham knows what it's like to come to terms
with the words ``you have breast cancer.'' For the past year, she's
lived through the diagnosis, scares, fear, surgeries and drugs, and
now she helps others facing the same questions and uncertainities
through the volunteer, non-profit group Bosom Buddies of Georgia
Inc. ``One weekend, I went to visit a woman who, when she found out
(about her cancer), she bought a casket, she found a cemetery plot
and she just kept crying,'' said Gresham, 41. ``You lose it. You
ask yourself, `Why is this happening to me?' But you need to talk
to women who are surviving breast cancer. They've got the
information. They've got the experience.'' Women's awareness of
breast cancer and the need for early detection were raised last
week, when WSB-TV anchor Monica Kaufman disclosed that a small
tumor was detected in her left breast. (Guthrie, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 25.

   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Another Saturday night. Another long
ride home without having bagged any prey, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Michele Alexander and Jeannie Long _ both 28, single and weary
of the hunt _ started joking about men. Not about keeping them (the
coup de grace!), but about losing them (no trick there).
</P>
<P>
   _ Day 2: Swing by Blockbuster and rent When Harry Met Sally.
</P>
<P>
   _ Day 3: Call your ugliest friend for a ``girls' night out.''
This will make you look better.
</P>
<P>
   _ Day 5: Read his old yearbook. Ask if he still has feelings for
Stacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were howling,'' Alexander says. ``We practically wrote the
book right there in the car.''
</P>
<P>
   She and Long, both from Tallahassee, have been friends since
junior high. Now roommates in L.A., they work in the music industry
and call their home ``Melrose Place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The next morning, we were talking about The Rules (last year's
controversial book on how to snare a husband) and how they were
manipulative and impossible,'' Long says. ``Then, we said we should
write a book about what girls really do.''
</P>
<P>
   The result _ which they illustrated with stick figures and
stapled together to give as Christmas gifts _ was How to Lose a Guy
in 10 Days ($6.99, Bantam).
</P>
<P>
   _ Day 7: Join his gym. Anytime you ``accidentally'' run into
him, call it a ``ka-winky-dink.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Day 8: Suggest abstinence. Then, next time it will be more
special.
</P>
<P>
   _ Day 9: Fly your parents in to meet him.
</P>
<P>
   A friend called a literary agent in New York, and just two
months later, the pair had a contract.
</P>
<P>
   Both say they're not losers (``we do have dates''), and they're
each looking for a guy with a sense of humor _ the kind of guy
who'd laugh at their book.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not Jackie Collins,'' Long says. ``But you might as well
be honest. Guys who read it are a lot more understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Day 10: Tell him he's changed, and you don't know him anymore.
Suggest therapy. Yell, cry, throw your shoe at him, collapse on the
hood of his car _ anything to get him back.
</P>
<P>
   Go to party. Meet someone else. Return to Day 1.

 &HT;    Amid all the claptrap of modern-day life, is anybody listening?
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When I bought a new car a few years ago, one of the
features I enjoyed most was the sound system. The speakers were
like nothing I'd experienced in an automobile. It was like the
first time I heard, years earlier, music on Bose 901s. The sound
filled every cubic inch of space, expanding like air being pumped
into a balloon.
</P>
<P>
   At less than a quarter of maximum volume, the ordinary speech of
a news broadcast was audible and clear. For music I'd turn it up a
notch, and occasionally, if it was a piece I especially liked and I
was alone, I'd let it rip. But never to the halfway point. That was
too loud, the sound itself overwhelmed by sheer volume.
</P>
<P>
   Now I find myself turning it up higher than I once did, almost
to halfway. I don't think it's my ears and I know there's nothing
wrong with the speakers. I think I've become desensitized to sound.
I think most of us have. Not in the way a rock musician's ears are
blasted to bits, but in the everyday, incremental ways of expecting
everything to be louder than it has to be.
</P>
<P>
   On ESPN Chris Berman yammers away at high volume, words pouring
out faster than the ear can take them in. With Dick Vitale, the
basketball commentator, at least you know it's an amiable clown's
act. And both, after all, are only playing to a particular audience
_ this is TV sports, not C-SPAN. The excitement has to be urged on
people.
</P>
<P>
   It becomes a different matter when volume is obligatory
everywhere else. Not just at stoplights, where a car stereo blares
loud enough to be heard in all directions for a quarter-mile, but
in places where you wouldn't have expected it. Restaurants all of a
sudden have become noisy places, operating on the assumption that
patrons like the commotion. Try to find a quiet corner for
conversation. Pots and pans clang like cymbals, chatter at the next
table spills indiscriminately onto yours, the piped-in music drowns
out even Chris Berman.
</P>
<P>
   We don't like silence; we're afraid of it. It's no accident that
disputes over school prayer always seem to turn on the phrase
``moment of silence.'' You get the feeling, all denials to the
contrary, that it's that gap of soundlessness as much as prayer
that threatens people. The presumption is that someone should be
talking, explaining, gabbing every second.
</P>
<P>
   I happen to be reading a book by Stephen L. Carter titled
``Civility: Manners, Morals and the Etiquette of Democracy.'' Don't
be put off _ as I momentarily was _ by that word ``etiquette.'' I
grew up thinking it meant which side of the plate you placed the
knife on and which side the fork and spoon _ something I made a
point of learning and six months later forgot.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's book hasn't received the reviews it deserves, and I
think I know why. Among other things, he thinks we're too ready to
trot out the tattered banner of the First Amendment every time some
pop music group records an album about women being raped. (Funny
how the First Amendment is always being pressed into service for
the least edifying causes.) But Carter, who teaches law at Yale,
knows something of the Constitution. More than that, he sees the
kind of people we've become:
</P>
<P>
   ``The sound, the noise, the sheer unrelenting loudness of our
world combine to make civility difficult to achieve. The challenge
of contemporary life is not so much that we are busy as that we are
blasted around the clock with the sounds of our society: raucous
music, insistent telephones, cynical newscasts, angry traffic.
Small wonder that we seem so selfish. Small wonder that the polls
say people think incivility is growing worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is sold on civility, as Carter acknowledges. For
some it's hypocrisy, a form of social conditioning whose real
purpose is to mask deep social conflict. But vigorous debate in the
public arena is one thing and the everyday sounds around us quite
another. Whatever the causes, we've lost, it would seem, the
capacity to be quiet once in a while, to just shut up.
</P>
<P>
   Carter quotes former French Premier Georges Clemenceau, who said
the United States was ``the only nation in history which has
miraculously gone directly from barbarism to degeneration without
the usual interval of civilization.'' And then Carter says
Clemenceau was, of course, overstating matters to make a point.
</P>
<P>
   No, I don't think he was exaggerating at all. Civilization was
two stops back, and we missed it. We were too busy gabbing,
yelling, remonstrating, all at high volume.
</P>
<P>
   In all the commotion, no one hears much, and the sounds we don't
hear at all are the sounds of silence.

 &HT;    Vanity Fair focuses on 200 women
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's probably no surprise to most that Vanity Fair ($3.95) has
named Oprah Winfrey as the most influential woman in America.
Winfrey is one of the 200 female legends, leaders and trailblazers
featured in a dazzling pictorial portfolio by Annie Leibovitz and
30 other photographers. Anne Cox Chambers, chairwoman of Atlanta
Newspapers Inc. and former U.S. ambassador to Belgium, is
spotlighted as one of the leading women in media.
</P>
<P>
   Other categories, including entertainment, politics and book
publishing, feature the usual suspects: Madonna, Barbra Streisand,
Jodie Foster, Madeleine Albright, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Janet
Reno, Elizabeth Dole, Patricia Cornwell and Terry McMillan, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   Editor Graydon Carter notes that the special report represents a
milestone for the women's movement. ``A portfolio of this sort
would have been impossible 20 or 30 years ago''_ BOOKED: One of the
newest entries in the magazine field is Book ($4.95), a publication
devoted to literary matters. The debut issue features a cover story
on Tom Wolfe and his novel ``A Man in Full,'' and interviews with
authors Wally Lamb, Anna Quindlen and Jim Harrison. ``Book won't
just be about books,'' says editor Jerome Kramer. ``We're going to
write about people and places and ideas that are important to
people who care deeply about books.'' The Wolfe article offers
little new information, but the magazine has promise.
</P>
<P>
   _ THE NEWSWEEKLIES: Newsweek ($2.95) offers the most interesting
take on ``this tinny new impeachment war.'' Featuring photographs
of a painfully youthful Bill and Hillary Clinton _ all hair,
polyester and smiles _ the cover story, ``The Children of
Watergate,'' compares and contrasts many of the players in
Watergate and Monicagate. Even Henry Kissinger weighs in with an
essay on what it's like to conduct foreign policy in an impeachment
crisis. ``In such an atmosphere, normality and hysteria exist side
by side,'' the grand old diplomat writes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Time ($2.95) magazine offers a baffling special
report on ``How to Make a Better Student.'' Enjolique Aytch, a
17-year-old student at Atlanta's Grady High School, is one of
several kids with inspirational stories to tell, but these lessons
hardly seem revolutionary. The ``new'' tips for parents include: Be
role models, be involved, encourage learning, feed children's
passions and _ here's the wildest concept of all _ treat every
child as an individual. Well, duh.
</P>
<P>
   _ BEST SCI-FI: Entertainment Weekly ($2.95) takes us where no
magazine has gone before with a feature on the 100 all-time
greatest works of science fiction. Topping the list, of course, is
``Star Wars,'' the 1977 fable that rejuvenated a genre that had
fallen into a black hole. Close behind is ``Star Trek,'' the cult
series by Gene Roddenberry. Rounding out the Top 5 are ``The
Twilight Zone,'' ``Frankenstein,'' and ``2001: A Space Odyssey.''
</P>
<P>
   _ QUICK READS: Savannah, Ga. is not the only coastal city with
colorful characters. In the October issue of GQ ($3.50), Jack Hitt
remembers growing up in Charleston, S.C., with his own version of
Boo Radley next door. Three decades later, he discovers that Dawn
Pepita Langley Hall, who made headlines as one of the world's first
transsexuals, was not what she appeared to be. . . . In its
conspiracy issue, George ($2.95) raises questions about the
mysterious death of Clinton's Whitewater partner Jim McDougal,
probes the murders of Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls, and invites
filmmaker Oliver Stone to speculate about secret plots throughout
history.

 &HT;    Meet the designers who make your clothes: Dana Buchman
 &HT;    (EDS: Third in a series _ contact CoxNet at 404-526-5456 if
previous stories are needed.)
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Target customer: A woman 35 and older,
who doesn't want to spend a lot of time getting dressed but who
also doesn't mind spending money on quality clothing at such stores
as Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdale's and Nordstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Since its founding in 1987, Dana Buchman the company, a division
of Liz Claiborne Inc., has grown to a $200 million a year company.
It is opening two boutiques this year _ including a
4,000-square-foot boutique on Worth Avenue in Palm Beach _ to bring
the total to five. It also doubled its store space on 57th Street
in New York, and three or four other boutiques are planned for next
year.
</P>
<P>
   And Dana Buchman the person, a 46-year-old Memphis, Tenn.
native, is pleased.
</P>
<P>
   Her target customer is herself. She's not into the ``18-year-old
runway model thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wear a pantsuit every day,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   For Buchman and vice president of design, Karen Harman (the two
have worked together for 15 years), designing clothes is not about
their own artistic gratification. They study their customers,
traveling the country trying to get a sense of how the women who
wear their designs live and what they're looking for in corporate
or ``event'' attire. They make personal appearances, greeting
customers at the upscale department stores that carry any of the
six Buchman lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know how our customer lives, her body configuration and
what she's comfortable in,'' says Harman.
</P>
<P>
   When they return to New York, they assess their works in
progress by trying to determine where such outfits would most
likely be worn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We often ask each other, `Where are you going in that?' If we
can't figure it out, we scrap it or change it,'' Buchman said.
</P>
<P>
   They also survey all designs from the staff, including buttons,
beads and accessories. Recently, on a typical day, Buchman studied
a sheer, leaf-print, olive-toned scarf. ``If you put black in it,
then the lady will know what color shoes to wear,'' she said.
Practical and pretty.
</P>
<P>
   Her clothing lines range from size 2 to 24. The least expensive
piece is a $48 cotton and Lycra T-shirt. At the other end is a
cashmere trench coat at $750. A top-tier line, Dana Buchman Luxe,
features clothing styled with embroidery and beading and
transitional layering pieces _ short jackets over wide pants; long
jackets over short skirts. Luxe outfits _ in the $180 to $450 price
range _ are appropriate for office and evening wear, Buchman says.
</P>
<P>
   Next up: boxers. Why not? Buchman thinks it's a cute idea. She
wears them and a T-shirt for reading at home. She's into Dickens
and Edith Wharton, with a copy of The New Yorker thrown in.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, Harman visited Palm Beach for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was expecting ladies in cashmere twin sets and pearls,'' she
says. ``And there was a woman there just like that _ just one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She must be hired by the Palm Beach tourist authority to be
there,'' Buchman says.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion item they would banish: ``enormous shoulderpads.''
</P>
<P>
   Phrase they are tired of hearing from women: ``Oh, I could never
wear that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to shake them,'' Harman says.
</P>
<P>
   Coming tomorrow: Ann Taylor

that broke the century-old grip of utility monopolies on power
generation and allowed customers to choose their own power provider

   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   ROSENFELD-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ The vote by the House of
Representatives to conduct an inquiry into possible impeachment was
historic because Bill Clinton joined the short list of presidents
so entailed. But the transparently political nature of this
undertaking was clearly evident in the hours of debate preceding
the vote and in the vote itself. By HARRY ROSENFELD.

   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ In the aftermath of his
daughter's death in the Oklahoma City bombings, Bud Welch wanted
nothing less of the killers than ``to see them fry.'' Had anyone

 By SUSAN GOUGH HENLY 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Forged with gold-rush money at the height of the Victorian era,
Melbourne is graced with grand public buildings, tree-lined
boulevards and decorous parks. While it may be the most British of
Australian cities, it also has one of the world's largest Greek
cities, a sizable Vietnamese quarter, neighborhood markets that
rival those in Paris, and a palm-fringed waterfront akin to Venice
Beach, Calif. Decades ago, Italian immigrants brought espresso to
its cafes. Today its restaurants are sophisticated and multiethnic,
drawing from the rich surrounding farmlands, vineyards and coastal
waters.
 &HT;    Trams still rattle along the middle of streets on the way to
distinctive neighborhoods that ring the city center:
fashion-conscious South Yarra, funky St. Kilda by the bay, the
terrace houses of Albert Park, retro Fitzroy and the bargain
shopping haven of Richmond, to name a few.
 &HT;    The people here are generally easygoing, but when it comes to
sports _ be it Aussie Rules football, the Melbourne Cup horse race,
the Australian Grand Prix auto race or the Australian Open tennis
tournament _ they display a rare fanaticism. Long before Sydney,
Melbourne was the first Australian city to host the Olympic Games
in 1956.
 &HT;    Melbourne's theater and live music scenes are among the most
vibrant in the country, and the National Gallery of Victoria has
one of the strongest art collections in the Southern Hemisphere.
With the Australian dollar near its 12-year low, this is an ideal
time for Americans to visit.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    The 13th Melbourne Festival, Oct. 15 to Nov. 1, is a celebration
of international and Australian performing and visual arts and free
street festivals, with this year's themes focusing on the family,
migration and indigenous culture. Highlights include ``Paintings
from Utopia'' by the Aboriginal artist Emily Kame Kngwarreye at the
National Gallery of Victoria, Sept. 8 to Nov. 22, and the
French-Albanian company Ballet Preljocaj's erotic ``Romeo and
Juliet'' set in a police state, Oct. 29 to Nov. 1.
 &HT;    Oz Opera and Company B Belvoir presents its remake of Leonard
Bernstein's ``Trouble in Tahiti'' Oct. 22 to 25, and performances
of the Abbey Theatre of Dublin's ``Secret Fall of Constance Wilde''
are Oct. 28 to Nov. 1. ``Teatro,'' Oct. 21 to 24, by the Italo-,
Greek- and Hispanic-Australian IRAA Theater and Canto Coro,
explores the stories of people living far from their countries of
birth searching for a home that does not exist. Tickets:
Ticketmaster, (61-3) 9256-8800.

Racecourse, Oct. 31 to Nov. 7, is Australia's biggest annual
international sporting event, the culmination of which is the

is full of all the pomp and fashion of its British counterparts.

 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    Melbourne's city center encompasses a wide range of architecture
and shopping. For each of its major east-west streets there is a
bustling lane in between worth exploring. Stop by the 19th-century
Old Treasury Building, State Houses of Parliament, and the
elaborate Princess Theater on Spring Street and wander into the
nearby Fitzroy Gardens.
 &HT;    Collins Street offers the ultra-chic George's Department Store
(No. 162), the ornate old-world Block's shopping arcade (No. 282)
and a world of diversity in between. Slip into Flinders Lane for
the galleries; several specialize in Aboriginal art. Little Bourke
Street is in the heart of the city's Chinatown. Free city-circle
trams (painted burgundy and gold) run every 10 minutes and pass
many of the major sights, taking about 40 minutes to make the
circuit.
 &HT;    With almost 1,000 merchants in a series of landmark buildings at
the corner of Elizabeth and Victoria streets, the Queen Victoria
Market is a multicultural food mecca and a good place to pick up

p.m., Friday 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., Saturday 6 a.m. to 3 p.m., Sunday 9

a.m.; $9) up to Herring Island sculpture park in a spit 'n polish
1918 steamboat. The sleek white Spirit of Melbourne, (61-3)
9696-0311, offers lunch ($29, departing 1 p.m.) and dinner cruises
($42, 7:30 p.m.). Both boats leave from Southgate and reservations
are essential.
 &HT;    Melbourne's tranquil Royal Botanic Gardens, bordering the Yarra
on Alexandra Avenue, offer a diverse selection of native and
imported plants. Highlights include the rain forest walk, the
eucalypts and the fern gully (where you may hear flying foxes
making a racket in the trees). A delightful teahouse sits beside
one of the lakes. Free tours depart from the National Herbarium (F
Gate) at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. Sunday to Friday; (61-3) 9252-2300.

9696-9090, fax (61-3) 9696-9092, is one of a row of double-story
Victorian terrace houses in the delightful inner-city suburb of
Albert Park. Guests stay in one of three charming rooms ($80 to
$87), all with private bath and decorated in Laura Ashley-style
prints, and indulge in full cooked breakfasts.
 &HT;    The Olembia Hotel, a restored 23-room Edwardian guesthouse at 96
Barkly Street, in beachside St. Kilda, (61-3) 9537-1412, fax (61-3)
9537-1600, is one of the best bargains around if you don't mind
sharing one of the black-and-white tiled bathrooms. Guests can

 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    The restaurant of the moment, Circa, The Prince, 2 Acland
Street, St. Kilda, (61-3) 9536-1122, is dramatic with its designer
curtains, minimalist with its spare courtyard and large potted
olive trees.
 &HT;    The British chef, Michael Lambie, offers seared scallops with
potato salad and truffle oil before an entree such as bouillabaisse
with saffron potatoes and rouille, a garlicky sauce, and a
caramelized pear tarte tatin for dessert. Dinner for two with wine
is around $110. Currently serving lunch Friday and Sunday, dinner
Tuesday through Sunday; starting Oct. 5, lunch daily except

seen. The food is classic with strong flavors delivered in delicate

and is also open for breakfast Monday to Friday.
 &HT;    Guernica, 257 Brunswick Street, Fitzroy, (61-3) 9416-0969, looks
and feels like a Left Bank bistro, but its food is an exotic
melange of cultural influences that the restaurant calls modern
Australian.
 &HT;    It offers, for starters, drunken chicken with deep-fried Asian
cole slaw and chile mayonnaise followed by prosciutto- and
olive-basted lamb cutlets with spinach, caramelized garlic, field
mushrooms and goat cheese. Desserts might include a Jerusalem
artichoke and vanilla-bean creme brulee. Dinner for two with wine,
$70. Lunch daily except Saturday, dinner every night.
 &HT;    Toofey's, at 162 Elgin Street, in the inner-city Italian
neighborhood of Carlton, (61-3) 9347-9838, is arguably Melbourne's
finest seafood restaurant.
 &HT;    Stark and sleek, with amusing fish sculptures, Toofey's serves
nori rolls of prawn and garfish (a long, thin fish with delicate
white flesh), seafood risotto and the freshest fish of the day
cooked to perfection. Dinner for two with wine, about $75. Dinner

 &HT;    Chinta Ria Soul, 94 Acland Street, St. Kilda, (61-3) 9525-4664,

 By SUSAN GOUGH HENLY 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Forged with gold-rush money at the height of the Victorian era,
Melbourne is graced with grand public buildings, tree-lined
boulevards and decorous parks. While it may be the most British of
Australian cities, it also has one of the world's largest Greek
cities, a sizable Vietnamese quarter, neighborhood markets that
rival those in Paris, and a palm-fringed waterfront akin to Venice
Beach, Calif. Decades ago, Italian immigrants brought espresso to
its cafes. Today its restaurants are sophisticated and multiethnic,
drawing from the rich surrounding farmlands, vineyards and coastal
waters.
 &HT;    Trams still rattle along the middle of streets on the way to
distinctive neighborhoods that ring the city center:
fashion-conscious South Yarra, funky St. Kilda by the bay, the
terrace houses of Albert Park, retro Fitzroy and the bargain
shopping haven of Richmond, to name a few.
 &HT;    The people here are generally easygoing, but when it comes to
sports _ be it Aussie Rules football, the Melbourne Cup horse race,
the Australian Grand Prix auto race or the Australian Open tennis
tournament _ they display a rare fanaticism. Long before Sydney,
Melbourne was the first Australian city to host the Olympic Games
in 1956.
 &HT;    Melbourne's theater and live music scenes are among the most
vibrant in the country, and the National Gallery of Victoria has
one of the strongest art collections in the Southern Hemisphere.
With the Australian dollar near its 12-year low, this is an ideal
time for Americans to visit.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    The 13th Melbourne Festival, Oct. 15 to Nov. 1, is a celebration
of international and Australian performing and visual arts and free
street festivals, with this year's themes focusing on the family,
migration and indigenous culture. Highlights include ``Paintings
from Utopia'' by the Aboriginal artist Emily Kame Kngwarreye at the
National Gallery of Victoria, Sept. 8 to Nov. 22, and the
French-Albanian company Ballet Preljocaj's erotic ``Romeo and
Juliet'' set in a police state, Oct. 29 to Nov. 1.
 &HT;    Oz Opera and Company B Belvoir presents its remake of Leonard
Bernstein's ``Trouble in Tahiti'' Oct. 22 to 25, and performances
of the Abbey Theatre of Dublin's ``Secret Fall of Constance Wilde''
are Oct. 28 to Nov. 1. ``Teatro,'' Oct. 21 to 24, by the Italo-,
Greek- and Hispanic-Australian IRAA Theater and Canto Coro,
explores the stories of people living far from their countries of
birth searching for a home that does not exist. Tickets:
Ticketmaster, (61-3) 9256-8800.
 &HT;    The Victoria Racing Club's Spring Racing Carnival at Flemington
Racecourse, Oct. 31 to Nov. 7, is Australia's biggest annual
international sporting event, the culmination of which is the
Foster's Melbourne Cup.
 &HT;    More than a horse race, it is a 138-year-old tradition that
brings the nation to a stop (this year at 3:20 p.m. on Nov. 3) and
is full of all the pomp and fashion of its British counterparts.
Tickets, $48 reserved seating in lawn stand, $15 general admission
(based on $1.56 Australian to the United States dollar), through
Ticketmaster at www.ticketmaster.com.au.
 &HT;    Wine Australia, Oct. 22 to 27 at the Melbourne Convention and
Exhibition Center, offers a chance to sample more than 8,000 wines
from 350 Australian wineries, representing 42 Australian winemaking
regions. Visitors can meet the winemakers and match the wines with

 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Read a good guidebook lately?
 &HT;    Chances are that in the crowded and competitive field of travel
guidebook publishing, the book in question was the product of
either Frommer's or Fodor's, the giants in the field.
 &HT;    But it's no coincidence that their mutual success is in large
part due to one man, Michael Spring. The former editorial director
of Fodor's is the current publisher of Macmillan Travel and its
flagship imprint, Frommer's, which claims to be the fastest-growing
travel-guide series in the United States.
 &HT;    Reshaping the two biggest guidebook names in the United States
has made Spring something of an expert on what traveling readers
are looking for.
 &HT;    ``Readers want to feel special,'' Spring says. ``They want to
know about traditional sites but in a fresh way. They want to have
the special moments you usually don't find in guidebooks. It's fine
to tell people about the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower, but the
memories they come home with are private moments. Sitting on a
bench in St. James Park watching a game of bowls or walking along
the Seine at 6:30 in the morning and coming upon Notre Dame. The
real challenge is when you're doing a whole series of guides.''
 &HT;    Spring should know. Before coming to Macmillan in 1994, he spent
seven years as the editorial director of Fodor's Travel
Publications.
 &HT;    Spring's efforts to remake that guidebook series were widely
acclaimed in the industry. Now he's attempting to do the same thing
with Frommer's, offering guidebooks to an increasingly segmented
market.
 &HT;    ``There's no longer a single traveler,'' Spring says. ``There
are different series to satisfy the needs of different travelers.
Frommer's had a reputation for being geriatric, for being safe and
school-marmy. We've rewritten everything for today's more savvy and
curious traveler. We're taking people off the beaten track. There's
a lot of outdoor information, on things like bike trips and sea
kayaking. People want to come home with more than a tan.''
 &HT;    There are 17 distinct series under the Frommer's imprint.
There's ``Frommer's Complete Guides,'' comprehensive guides aimed
at both leisure and business travelers. ``Frommer's Portable
Guides'' are smaller and less-expensive guides for short-term
visitors. There's also ``Frommer's Irreverent Guides.''
 &HT;    ``You had student guides and guides for grownups but nothing for
savvy people in their 20s and 30s who hated guidebooks,'' Spring
says. ``These guides are unabashedly honest. They do knock
things.''
 &HT;    The ``Frommer's $-a-Day Guides'' are for value-oriented
travelers who want bang for their buck.
 &HT;    ``When Arthur Frommer started these guides in 1957 with `Europe
on $5 a Day,''' Spring says, ``his idea was not to travel cheaply
so much as to make travel a process of discovery, of getting inside
a culture. He just felt you could do it best on low budget.''
 &HT;    Arthur Frommer sold his interest in the series years ago, but
his name remains. Spring says that ``We're trying to put back that
sense of adventure and discovery in the books. So that you can have
adventure on whatever budget you have.''
 &HT;    Spring prides Frommer's on publishing exact prices and for
publishing annual editions, which few competitors do.
 &HT;    ``It takes almost a year to put together a guidebook and it's
out there for one year,'' Spring notes. ``That means that the
material is no more than two years out of date. In other guides,
the material is likely to be three or four years out of date. It's
enormously expensive to update, which is why many people only
publish a new edition every three or four years. The information is
incredibly perishable, but it's what people count on us most for.
We provide the details that let you have a worry-free vacation.''
 &HT;    Speaking of vacation, Spring had just returned from China, a
visit he said combined both work and play. His own sense of
adventure leads him to go on wilderness camping trips with his
family, to go dog sledding in Alaska or hiking with his kids at the
Arctic Circle.
 &HT;    He also has a fondness for trips he's done to Iceland, Tuscany,
Provence and Morocco, admitting that there are a lot of places he
hasn't been to yet _ places that he insists his writers live in
before they write about them.
 &HT;    And for anyone who has despaired of good, honest guidebook
writing, they should have a chat with Spring.
 &HT;    ``I love good writing,'' he says. ``I used to be an English
teacher. If someone says to me, `So what if a sentence has mixed
metaphors, it's just a travel guide,' I see purple. Travel writing
can be beautiful. And there's also the matter of honesty. Most
travel writing is the `What can I say that's nice variety.' It's
promotional. But if people want to be sold on destinations they can
get brochures. It's not our job to say nice things. We always
include the good and the bad.''
 &HT;    As for pundits who've predicted the demise of guidebooks because
of the advance of electronic media, Spring strongly disagrees.
 &HT;    ``They're not endangered by the Internet,'' Spring insists.
``When people travel, they want to have a book with them. But for
guidebooks to survive, they need to make people feel privileged.''

<P>
   Whether you're traveling solo or in a group, there are
discounts, deals and special offers just for the mature traveler.
Here are a few:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BRITRAIL SENIOR PARTY PASS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BritRail hasn't forgotten a thing for mature travelers _
including a Senior Party Pass for those ages 60 and older that's
priced as much as 25 percent lower than the regular BritRail Senior
Pass.
</P>
<P>
   The Party Pass permits each senior in a party of three to travel
any four days in a month first class for $224, or $202 for each of
four people in a party. These rates compare to $269 for a single
senior BritRail pass.
</P>
<P>
   To travel any eight days in one month the three-party price is
$325, or $293 for four people (compared to $390 for an individual).
</P>
<P>
   The price per senior in a three-person party for one month?
$608; the four-person Party Pass price is $548.
</P>
<P>
   It's all detailed in ``Britain's Heritage Cities,'' a brochure
that helps the independent traveler plan routes and stops for major
events in the cities and to decide which treasure houses and
gardens are available.
</P>
<P>
   For example, at the end of October in Stratford-on-Avon is the
English Music Festival, and from November through the end of
September 1999 the Royal Shakespeare Company will be performing.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of November, unique Christmas shopping is promised in
York's City Centre.
</P>
<P>
   For a copy of the brochure, call (888) 424-3731, or visit their
Web site at www.raileurope.com.
</P>
<P>
   To book, call your travel agent or BritRail.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DELTA FLIES SKYWISE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Delta is flying high with its updated program for mature
travelers. Now called The Delta SkyWise program (formerly ``Senior
Select Savings Plus''), those ages 62 and older can enroll for $40
to get discounted zone airfares to nearly 300 U.S. destinations.
</P>
<P>
   If you're accustomed to flying with friends or relatives, you
can also enroll up to three companions of any age for $25 a person.
</P>
<P>
   While the pricing is good, there are restrictions, including
capacity control, non-refundable fares, blackout dates and such.
Key provisions call for reservations made 14 days in advance with
tickets purchased at the time, round-trip purchase and a required
Saturday-night stay.
</P>
<P>
   Travel must be booked by June 12, 1999, started by June 26,
1999, and completed by June 30, 1999. If you had enrolled in Senior
Select Savings Plus, that program is cancelled.
</P>
<P>
   There are also deal sweeteners: discounts at Radisson and
Swissotel hotels, Alamo, Avis, Hertz and National rental cars, and
Delta Queen, Norwegian and Royal Caribbean cruise lines as well as
select Delta Vacation packages.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the new SkyWise program, Delta still offers 10
percent discounts for those ages 62 and older on most posted fares
and has the ``Young at Heart'' senior coupon books that cost $596
for four coupons.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, call Delta or visit their Web site at
www.delta-air.com/SkyWise. To enroll, call (800) 325-3750 and be
prepared to give your date of birth, SkyMiles number, Social
Security number and credit-card information.
</P>
<P>
   If you are enrolling companions, you'll need their SkyMiles
numbers and dates of birth, too.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COAST TO COAST FOR $254 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak offers many ways to travel America, but its Fall Explore
America Fares provide a leisurely way to travel coast to coast and
back for about $254, which includes the 15 percent senior discount
for travelers ages 62 and older.
</P>
<P>
   The ticket structure starts with the regular fare for traveling
one region at $179, two adjacent regions at $239 or the entire
country at $299. If you want to explore just Florida, the price is
$69.
</P>
<P>
   Mature travelers take 15 percent off these rates, as they can on
all full-fare Amtrak tickets, or special one-way fares.
</P>
<P>
   The Fall Explore America rates are on sale through Nov. 14 for
travel through Dec. 17. Tickets are non-refundable and require
14-day advance purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Work with your travel agent or call (800) 872-7245. You can also
visit their Web site at www.amtrak.com.

<P>
   &UR; ALASKA SIGHTSEEING &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gray Line of Alaska makes seeing the Great State easier _ and
cheaper _ for those traveling on their own or adding extra
sightseeing days before or after cruises.
</P>
<P>
   Two popular tours eligible for the senior discounts are the
Portage Glacier Cruise aboard the mv Ptarmigan, south of Anchorage,
and a visit to Gold Dredge No. 8 at Fairbanks.
</P>
<P>
   The three Portage Glacier tours are a 10-hour tour that combines
the highlights of Anchorage with the cruise for $77; a seven-hour
cruise tour that includes a stop at Alyeska Ski Resort for an
optional tram ride to the top of the mountain for $60; and a
one-hour tour for those with their own transportation to the cruise
dock for $25.
</P>
<P>
   Gold Dredge No. 8, the only dredge open to the public and a
National Historic Site, has two tours eligible for the senior
discount.
</P>
<P>
   The four-hour Discover the Gold Tour for $57 includes a miner's
lunch and a chance to try your hand at panning gold. An eight-hour
tour that combines a tour of the Dredge site and a four-hour
Sternwheeler Cruise on the Chena and Tanana rivers costs $57.
</P>
<P>
   A senior discount of 10 percent is applied to all sightseeing
tours offered by Gray Line of Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   All these tours are available from mid-May to the end of
September. For reservations, call (800) 544-2206. For brochures,
call (800) 628-2449.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRY BEFORE YOU BUY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For seniors looking to try an active adult community lifestyle,
Del Webb's Vacation Getaway packages have been extended to their
Spruce Creek Communities in Ocala, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   For $99, a mature traveler age 55 or older can stay three days

the recreational amenities like the fitness center, bocce,
billiards, tennis courts and swimming pool. Travel companions must
be 18 or older. For reservation information, call (888) 932-2639.
</P>
<P>
   Many Del Webb communities in tourist markets such as Phoenix,
Ariz.; Las Vegas, Nev.; Hilton Head, S.C.; Georgetown, Texas; and
Palm Desert, Calif., offer similar Vacation Getaway programs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ISRAEL'S HOTEL DEAL &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Israel's Dan Hotel chain offers its Silver Star promotion at Dan

Jerusalem for guests ages 65 and older.

food bills through April 1999.
</P>
<P>
   This offer is valid Sunday-Thursday in Haifa and Jerusalem and
weekends in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   Contact your travel agent or call (800) 223-7773.
 &UR; ----- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For mature travelers it's the best time of life to get up and
go! The aim of this column is to help make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the bargains and special trips that will be
reported on are for 49ers-plus, the information can help younger
travelers spot values too.
</P>
<P>
   Mature travelers should remember that wherever they go, whatever
they do, they should always ask for the senior-citizen discount,
even if one isn't posted. That's one of the main privileges of
being among the ``chronologically gifted'' who are 50 or over. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Whether you're traveling solo or in a group, there are
discounts, deals and special offers just for the mature traveler.
Here are a few:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BRITRAIL SENIOR PARTY PASS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BritRail hasn't forgotten a thing for mature travelers _
including a Senior Party Pass for those ages 60 and older that's
priced as much as 25 percent lower than the regular BritRail Senior
Pass.
</P>
<P>
   The Party Pass permits each senior in a party of three to travel
any four days in a month first class for $224, or $202 for each of
four people in a party. These rates compare to $269 for a single
senior BritRail pass.
</P>
<P>
   To travel any eight days in one month the three-party price is
$325, or $293 for four people (compared to $390 for an individual).
</P>
<P>
   The price per senior in a three-person party for one month?
$608; the four-person Party Pass price is $548.
</P>
<P>
   It's all detailed in ``Britain's Heritage Cities,'' a brochure
that helps the independent traveler plan routes and stops for major
events in the cities and to decide which treasure houses and
gardens are available.
</P>
<P>
   For example, at the end of October in Stratford-on-Avon is the
English Music Festival, and from November through the end of
September 1999 the Royal Shakespeare Company will be performing.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of November, unique Christmas shopping is promised in
York's City Centre.
</P>

<P>
   &UR; DELTA FLIES SKYWISE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Delta is flying high with its updated program for mature
travelers. Now called The Delta SkyWise program (formerly ``Senior
Select Savings Plus''), those ages 62 and older can enroll for $40
to get discounted zone airfares to nearly 300 U.S. destinations.
</P>
<P>
   If you're accustomed to flying with friends or relatives, you
can also enroll up to three companions of any age for $25 a person.
</P>
<P>
   While the pricing is good, there are restrictions, including
capacity control, non-refundable fares, blackout dates and such.
Key provisions call for reservations made 14 days in advance with
tickets purchased at the time, round-trip purchase and a required
Saturday-night stay.
</P>
<P>
   Travel must be booked by June 12, 1999, started by June 26,
1999, and completed by June 30, 1999. If you had enrolled in Senior
Select Savings Plus, that program is cancelled.
</P>
<P>
   There are also deal sweeteners: discounts at Radisson and
Swissotel hotels, Alamo, Avis, Hertz and National rental cars, and
Delta Queen, Norwegian and Royal Caribbean cruise lines as well as
select Delta Vacation packages.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the new SkyWise program, Delta still offers 10
percent discounts for those ages 62 and older on most posted fares
and has the ``Young at Heart'' senior coupon books that cost $596
for four coupons.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, call Delta or visit their Web site at
www.delta-air.com/SkyWise. To enroll, call (800) 325-3750 and be
prepared to give your date of birth, SkyMiles number, Social
Security number and credit-card information.
</P>
<P>
   If you are enrolling companions, you'll need their SkyMiles
numbers and dates of birth, too.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COAST TO COAST FOR $254 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak offers many ways to travel America, but its Fall Explore
America Fares provide a leisurely way to travel coast to coast and
back for about $254, which includes the 15 percent senior discount
for travelers ages 62 and older.
</P>
<P>
   The ticket structure starts with the regular fare for traveling
one region at $179, two adjacent regions at $239 or the entire
country at $299. If you want to explore just Florida, the price is
$69.
</P>
<P>
   Mature travelers take 15 percent off these rates, as they can on
all full-fare Amtrak tickets, or special one-way fares.
</P>
<P>
   The Fall Explore America rates are on sale through Nov. 14 for
travel through Dec. 17. Tickets are non-refundable and require
14-day advance purchase.

cheaper _ for those traveling on their own or adding extra
sightseeing days before or after cruises.
</P>
<P>
   Two popular tours eligible for the senior discounts are the

<P>
   Gold Dredge No. 8, the only dredge open to the public and a
National Historic Site, has two tours eligible for the senior
discount.
</P>
<P>
   The four-hour Discover the Gold Tour for $57 includes a miner's
lunch and a chance to try your hand at panning gold. An eight-hour
tour that combines a tour of the Dredge site and a four-hour
Sternwheeler Cruise on the Chena and Tanana rivers costs $57.
</P>
<P>

   For mature travelers it's the best time of life to get up and
go! The aim of this column is to help make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the bargains and special trips that will be
reported on are for 49ers-plus, the information can help younger
travelers spot values too.
</P>
<P>
   Mature travelers should remember that wherever they go, whatever
they do, they should always ask for the senior-citizen discount,
even if one isn't posted. That's one of the main privileges of
being among the ``chronologically gifted'' who are 50 or over. &QL;

SEVERAL ACTORS HAVE SHARED BOND-ING EXPERIENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Would you please list all the James Bond 007 movies and their
leading men? The ``Casino Royale'' I have says ``the original James
Bond.''
</P>
<P>
   _ J.B.M., Jacksonville, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   A: The 19th James Bond film is being produced with Pierce
Brosnan in the lead. Its working title, ``Bond 19,'' presumably
will be changed.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the first 18 and the actor who portrayed ``Bond, James
Bond'':
</P>
<P>
   SEAN CONNERY: ``Dr. No'' (1962), ``From Russia With Love''
(1962), ``Goldfinger'' (1964), ``Thunderball'' (1965) and ``You
Only Live Twice'' (1967).
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE LAZENBY: ``On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' (1969).
</P>
<P>
   CONNERY: ``Diamonds are Forever'' (1971).
</P>
<P>
   ROGER MOORE: ``Live and Let Die'' (1973), ``The Man with the
Golden Gun'' (1974), ``The Spy Who Loved Me'' (1977), ``Moonraker''
(1979), ``For Your Eyes Only'' (1981), ``Octopussy'' (1983) and ``A
View to a Kill'' (1985).
</P>
<P>
   TIMOTHY DALTON: ``The Living Daylights'' (1987) and ``License to
Kill'' (1989).
</P>
<P>
   PIERCE BROSNAN: ``Goldeneye'' (1995) and ``Tomorrow Never Dies''
(1997).
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, Barry Nelson portrayed Bond in ``Casino Royale,'' a
60-minute teleplay that aired on CBS. Producers changed Bond from
British to American for the program.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was the inspiration for the name Indiana Jones?
</P>
<P>
   _ J.D., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: When George Lucas first came up with the concept for
``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' in 1973, he named the character after
his pet Alaskan malamute, named Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   The original idea for the adventuring archeologist came from
``an old poster of a movie hero jumping from a horse to a truck,''
John Baxter writes in ``Stephen Spielberg: The Unauthorized
Biography.'' ``It reminded him of the serial cliff-hangers of the
'30s and '40s.''
</P>
<P>
   The furry dog also inspired another Lucas character: Chewbacca
the Wookie from ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I write to Ricki Lake?
</P>
<P>
   _ S.C., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to Lake in care of the William Morris Agency, 151 El
Camino Drive, Beverly Hills, CA 90212.
</P>
<P>
   Lake is in her fifth year as host of the syndicated ``Ricki Lake
Show,'' which celebrated its 1,000th episode on May 29. She turned
30 on Sept. 21. She has an 18-month-old son, Milo, with husband Rob
Sussman.

 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 BY STEVEN T. GOLDBERG 
 ADAPTED FROM ``BUT WHICH MUTUAL FUNDS?'' by STEVEN T. GOLDBERG  
 Copyright 1998 The Kiplinger Washington Editors, Inc. 
 Published by Kiplinger Books  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stock market's turmoil over the past several months has been
unnerving to almost everyone. When is the turbulence going to stop?
Is the stock market safe? What are good funds to buy now?
</P>
<P>
   Such questions beset nearly all investors in times like these.
But investing in mutual funds can be the right choice _ even when
the market is heading down.
</P>
<P>
   And if you invest in fundamentally sound funds that have proven
themselves over the long haul, a market decline is really the best
time to invest, because stocks are cheaper.
 &UR; WHY PUT YOUR MONEY IN THE MARKET? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Given today's market turmoil, many people want to know: Which
way is the stock market headed next, and what can we expect in the
future?
</P>
<P>
   Alas, despite their frequent pronouncements, none of Wall
Street's highly paid analysts have more than a hunch about which
way the stock market will go today, tomorrow or six months from
now. In fact, you're probably better off paying no attention to
predictions about which way the market is going, because nobody
knows.
</P>
<P>
   Just one example of the experts' fallibility: In 1979, Business
Week ran a cover story: ``The Death of Equities.'' The story argued
that the stock market was never again going to offer the kind of
gains it had in the past. Three years later, the biggest bull
market in history began.
</P>
<P>
   While you should ignore the predictions, do bear this in mind:
Through recessions, wars and all other matter of calamities,
stocks, on average, have returned an annualized 11 percent since
1926. That compares to 5.4 percent for government bonds, and 3.7
percent for ``safe'' cash investments such as short-term Treasury
bills, bank certificates of deposits and money-market funds.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, inflation has averaged 3.1 percent. After inflation,
stocks have actually been less likely to lose money over five-year
periods than bonds or cash.
</P>
<P>
   Over all five-year periods since 1926, stocks have outperformed
bonds and cash more than three-quarters of the time.
</P>
<P>
   But before you put all your money into stocks, remember:
</P>
<P>
   _ Stocks are far more volatile than bonds, meaning their returns
bounce around more from month to month and year to year. Cash is
the least volatile investment.
</P>
<P>
   _ In their worst year (1931), stocks plunged 43 percent, while
long-term corporate bonds lost only 8.1 percent in their poorest
year (1969), and the worst return on cash was a minuscule loss of
0.02 percent (in 1938).
</P>
<P>
   _ Stocks have fallen by at least 20 percent about once every
five years since 1926. There's nothing unique about this year's
decline. On average, it has taken two years and five months to
break even for an investor who put money into stocks just before a
20 percent or greater drop.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1929 crash (when stocks lost 86 percent of their value
over three years), though, it took until 1944 to break even. And
after the brutal 1973-74 bear market (when stocks fell 48 percent),
it took more than three years to break even _ and 10 years to break
even after inflation.
</P>
<P>
   You get the idea: Stocks are great long-term investments; bonds
and cash make more sense for shorter time periods. Think of stocks
as a roller coaster, bonds as bumper cars and cash as a carousel.
And tune out prognostications about which will do best in the short
run.
 &UR; BEFORE YOU GET STARTED &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you've decided to invest in stock funds, there are a few
things you should do before getting started.
</P>
<P>
   First, make sure you pay off high-interest debt such as credit
cards. Next, amass a cash cushion equal to at least three months of
your after-tax salary in a bank CD or a money-market account. Or,
if you are bolder, take out a home-equity line of credit that you
can tap in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've taken those steps, there are two things you'll need
to determine about yourself: Can you tolerate fear-inspiring market
declines like the recent one without selling your stock funds? And
how long will it be until you'll need your money?
</P>
<P>
   To find out how much risk you can handle, answer the following
two questions:
</P>
<P>
   1. The news media is filled with stories quoting experts who
predict stocks will lose money in the coming decade. Many suggest
investing in real estate. You would:
</P>
<P>
   a. consider selling some stocks funds and buying real estate
</P>
<P>
   b. be concerned, but stick to your long-term goals
</P>
<P>
   c. dismiss the articles as a sign of unwarranted pessimism over
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   2. Which of the following statements best describes you:
</P>
<P>
   a. I often change my mind and have trouble sticking to a plan.
</P>
<P>
   b. I can stay with a strategy as long as it seems to be doing
well.
</P>
<P>
   c. Once I make up my mind to do something, I tend to follow
through with it regardless of the obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   If you answered ``a'' both times, consider yourself a low-risk
investor. If you answered with one ``a'' and one ``b,'' or two
``b's,'' or one ``a'' and one ``c,'' you're a medium-risk investor.
</P>
<P>
   If you answered with at least one ``c'' and no ``a's,'' you're a
high-risk investor _ able to hold on to stocks no matter how rough
the market gets.
 &UR; HOW MUCH OF YOUR MONEY SHOULD YOU INVEST IN STOCKS? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some stockbrokers and financial planners would have you believe
that figuring out how much to invest in stocks and lower-risk
investments is as difficult as calculus. Not so.
</P>
<P>
   Following are two tables: one for investing for retirement and
the second for investing to meet all other goals.
</P>
<P>
   The table for retirement calls for you to invest a larger
portion of your money in stocks. That's because most people can
expect to live to be 85 or 90 years old _ a long time for your
money to grow, even in retirement.
</P>
<P>
   HOW MUCH OF YOUR MONEY TO INVEST IN STOCKS FOR RETIREMENT OR
WHILE IN RETIREMENT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (The column on the left represents the number of years until
retirement or your age in retirement)

</P>

you'll need the money)

 &UR; 0 to 2...............0..................0...............0 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Armed with this knowledge, and details that I'll give you on
which funds to buy in the next article, there's no need for you to
buy a fund with a sales charge, or to pay a stock broker or
financial adviser to help you select funds.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, once you become accustomed to the ups and downs of
the market, you may find you're more able to tolerate them. If so,
take the risk test again and see if you should increase the
percentage of your money you put into stock funds.
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR: GETTING STARTED &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to know you need to get started investing _ or
that you need to invest in a more methodical way. It's another
thing to actually pull the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Procrastination is the enemy of investors. You know all the
excuses: Either you don't have enough money, you'd rather spend it
on something else, the market seems too risky just now or you're
already so far behind that starting would be pointless.
</P>
<P>
   You'll feel better about making a move if, instead of plunging
in, you take a tentative step or two. Invest a modest but fixed
amount from your salary in shares of stock funds every month.
</P>
<P>
   Funds often allow a monthly (or quarterly) minimum investment of
as little as $25 or $50, as long as you agree to make regular,
automatic investments via your checking account. Having the fund
company take the money out of your bank account each month is a big
plus.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a 401(k) or 403(b) retirement plan at work, your
employer will similarly invest money straight from your paycheck.
And most companies match at least part of your investment, offering
an instant, substantial return.
</P>
<P>
   Money you don't see is money you won't spend and money you soon
will find you hardly miss. If you have to sit down and write a
check to a mutual fund every month, it's much easier to find
something else you'd rather spend the money on than your future.

<P>
   Despite the stock market's recent nose dive, it's easy to put
together a solid portfolio of mutual funds to meet your investment
needs. What's more, you can do it without knowing much about funds.
</P>
<P>
   Listed below are suggestions for ready-made portfolios (groups
of funds) that work together _ and that are suited to your
individual needs. The reason for owning a portfolio of funds is
that some types of funds will do well when others do poorly.
</P>
<P>
   The previous article helped you determine how much to invest in
stocks and lower-risk investments. The biggest factor in that
decision is how far you are from needing your money. Another
important factor is how much risk you can tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   To judge whether you have a low, moderate or high tolerance for
risk, just think it through for a minute: Are you the type of
person who can handle declines in your stock funds? Or are you
likely to panic and sell during bad times?
</P>
<P>
   If you have some trouble with risk, you're a low- or
moderate-risk investor. Otherwise, you're a high-risk investor.
</P>
<P>
   You'll need the following tables to assemble your portfolio of
funds.
</P>
<P>
   HOW MUCH OF YOUR MONEY TO INVEST IN STOCKS FOR RETIREMENT OR
WHILE IN RETIREMENT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (The column on the left represents the number of years until
retirement or your age in retirement)
 &UR; .........................TOLERANCE FOR RISK &QL; 
 &UR; ........................LOW...............MODERATE.........HIGH &QL; 
 &UR; More than 15 yrs.........100 percent....100 percent....100 percent &QL; 
 &UR; 10 to 15 yrs..............70.............80............100 &QL; 
 &UR; 6 to 10 yrs...............60.............70............100 &QL; 
 &UR; 0 to 6 yrs................40.............50.............85 &QL; 
 &UR; Early retirement (age 65-75).35..........45.............60 &QL; 
 &UR; Late retirement (over age 75).30.........40.............50 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HOW MUCH TO INVEST IN STOCKS FOR ALL GOALS EXCEPT RETIREMENT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (The column on the left represents the number of years until
you'll need the money)
 &UR; ....................TOLERANCE FOR RISK &QL; 
 &UR; ....................LOW............MODERATE............HIGH &QL; 
 &UR; More than 15 yrs....80 percent........100 percent.....100 percent &QL; 
 &UR; 10 to 15 yrs........60.................80.............100 &QL; 
 &UR; 6 to 10 yrs.........55.................70..............90 &QL; 
 &UR; 4 to 6 yrs..........30.................40..............60 &QL; 
 &UR; 2 to 4..............10.................25..............35 &QL; 
 &UR; 0 to 2...............0..................0...............0 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next step is selecting a portfolio of funds that work in
sync. Owning a diversified mix of stock funds (and usually some
bond funds) minimizes the fluctuations of your overall investments.
</P>
<P>
   Bear in mind that the funds in this article are not necessarily
going to be the top performers in their categories. But they are
proven, solid funds that work well together. That's what any
investor should search for.
 &UR; USING INDEX FUNDS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before looking at portfolios of actively managed funds, here's a
really simple alternative _ one that I have found is easier for
many people to actually implement.
</P>
<P>
   This approach employs index funds, which mirror the entire stock
market (or bond market). Because they do, index funds can give you
exposure to all segments of the markets.
</P>
<P>
   These funds strive to track a market index or average _ rather
than to excel. At first blush, that may sound like a losing
strategy, but it's not.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that most fund managers fail to beat the averages.
Adding to the simplicity of index funds, you don't have to monitor
them once you buy them. That's because virtually anyone can manage
an index fund.
</P>
<P>
   Further adding to their advantage, index funds charge lower
annual expenses of investors than do actively managed funds.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard (800-635-1511) has fine, low-cost index funds. You can
build a great, long-term stock portfolio with just two:
</P>
<P>
   _ Vanguard Index Total Stock Market, which tracks all U.S.
stocks, not just large ones.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vanguard Total International, which gives you the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Following are portfolios using these funds, as well as bond
funds when needed.
</P>
<P>
   FOR RETIREMENT 0 TO 50 YEARS AWAY _ OR ANY OTHER GOALS SIX OR
MORE YEARS AWAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Invest 75 percent of your stock money in Vanguard Index Total
Stock Market and 25 percent in Vanguard Total International.
</P>
<P>
   If the tables say you need to keep some of your money out of
stocks, invest that portion in Vanguard Index Total Bond Market. If
you're in the 28 percent tax bracket or higher and are investing
outside a tax-deferred account, put your bond money in Vanguard
Municipal High Yield.
</P>
<P>
   FOR EARLY RETIREMENT (UP TO AGE 75) OR ANY OTHER GOALS FOUR TO
SIX YEARS IN THE FUTURE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Invest 90 percent of your stock money in Vanguard Index Total
Stock Market and 10 percent in Vanguard Total International.
</P>
<P>
   Invest your bond money in Vanguard Index Total Bond Market. If
you're in the 28 percent tax bracket or higher, though, instead
divide your bond money evenly between Vanguard Municipal High Yield
and Vanguard Municipal Intermediate.
</P>
<P>
   FOR LATE RETIREMENT (AGES 75 AND OVER) OR ANY OTHER GOALS TWO TO
FOUR YEARS AWAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Put all your stock money into Vanguard Index Total Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   Put half your bond money in Vanguard Bond Index Short Term,
leaving the remainder in Vanguard Index Total Bond Market. If
you're in the 28 percent bracket or higher, instead divide your
bond money between Vanguard Municipal Intermediate and Vanguard
Municipal Limited Term.
</P>
<P>
   FOR GOALS TWO OR FEWER YEARS AWAY (EXCEPT FOR RETIREMENT) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Divide all your money between Vanguard Bond Index Short Term and
Vanguard Money Market Prime. If you're in the 28 percent tax
bracket or higher, substitute Vanguard Municipal Limited Term for
Vanguard Bond Index Short Term.
 &UR; ANOTHER APPROACH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instead of using index funds, you can invest in T. Rowe Price
Spectrum Growth (800-638-5660) and T. Rowe Price Spectrum Income.
Both are low-cost ``funds of funds'' _ in other words, they
themselves invest in other T. Rowe Price funds.
</P>
<P>
   Consulting the tables, use Spectrum Growth in place of all stock
funds and Spectrum Income when stock funds are not called for. When
you are two years from needing your money, shift it to T. Rowe
Price Prime Reserves.
</P>
<P>
   That's all there is to it.
 &UR; CHERRY-PICKING FUNDS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's only a little more bother to gather a portfolio of actively
managed funds from more than one fund family. There's more
paperwork and such, but it may be worth the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Like the previous portfolios, each of the these will give you
ownership of U.S. and foreign stocks, stocks of large companies and
stocks of small companies, as well as stocks of fast-growing
companies and stocks of cheap, beaten-down companies. As you get
closer to needing your money, the portfolios provide you with less
aggressive funds.
</P>
<P>
   In most instances, they'll also give you exposure to different
corners of the bond market.
</P>
<P>
   FOR RETIREMENT IN 10 OR MORE YEARS _ OR ANY OTHER GOALS 15 OR
MORE YEARS AWAY:
</P>
<P>
   _ Skyline Small Cap Value Plus (15 percent of your stock money;
800-458-5222).
</P>
<P>
   _ Berger New Generation (10 percent; 800-333-1001).
</P>
<P>
   _ Harbor Capital Appreciation (25 percent; 800-422-1050).
</P>
<P>
   _ Selected American Shares (20 percent; 800-243-1575).
</P>
<P>
   _ Artisan International (30 percent; 800-344-1770).
</P>
<P>
   Put any non-stock money into Loomis Sayles Bond, which you'll
have to buy through a discount broker such as Charles Schwab
(800-435-4000). If you're in the 28 percent tax bracket or higher
and investing outside a tax-deferred retirement account, substitute
Vanguard Municipal High Yield (800-635-1511).
</P>
<P>
   FOR RETIREMENT 0 TO 10 YEARS AWAY OR ANY OTHER GOALS 10 TO 15
YEARS AWAY:
</P>
<P>
   _ Berger New Generation (10 percent)
</P>
<P>
   _ Third Avenue Small Cap (10 percent; 800-443-1021)
</P>
<P>
   _ Harbor Capital Appreciation (25 percent)
</P>
<P>
   _ Babson Value (25 percent; 800-422-2766)
</P>
<P>
   _ Artisan International (30 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Divide your non-stock money between Loomis Sayles Bond and
Harbor Bond (800-422-1050). If you're in the 28 percent bracket or
higher, instead use Vanguard Municipal High Yield and Vanguard
Municipal Intermediate.
</P>
<P>
   FOR EARLY RETIREMENT (UP TO AGE 75) OR ANY OTHER GOALS SIX TO 10
YEARS IN THE FUTURE:
</P>
<P>
   _ T. Rowe Price Equity Income (35 percent; 800-638-5660)
</P>
<P>
   _ Yacktman (35 percent; 800-525-8258)
</P>
<P>
   _ T. Rowe Price Small Cap Stock (10 percent; 800-638-5660)
</P>
<P>
   _ Tweedy Browne Global Value (20 percent; 800-432-4789).
</P>
<P>
   Divide your non-stock money between Loomis Sayles Bond and
Harbor Bond. If you're in the 28 percent bracket or higher, instead
use Vanguard Municipal High Yield and Vanguard Municipal
Intermediate.
</P>
<P>
   FOR LATE RETIREMENT (AGES 75 AND OVER) OR ANY OTHER GOALS FOUR
TO SIX YEARS AWAY:
</P>
<P>
   _ T. Rowe Price Equity Income (60 percent)
</P>
<P>
   _ Royce Premier (20 percent; 800-221-4268)
</P>
<P>
   _ CGM Realty Fund (20 percent; 800-345-4048).
</P>
<P>
   Invest one quarter of your bond money in Northeast Investors
Trust (800-225-6704). Put the remainder into Harbor Bond or
Vanguard Municipal Intermediate (800-635-1511) depending on your
tax bracket.
</P>
<P>
   FOR GOALS (EXCEPT RETIREMENT) TWO TO FOUR YEARS AWAY:
</P>
<P>
   _ Greenspring (65 percent; 800-366-3863)
</P>
<P>
   _ Fidelity Real Estate (35 percent; 800-544-8888)
</P>
<P>
   Divide your bond money evenly among Harbor Bond, Loomis Sayles
High Yield (again, you'll have to buy the fund through a discount
broker) and Vanguard Short-Term Corporate (800-635-1511). If you're
in the 28 percent tax bracket or higher, use Loomis Sayles High
Yield, but substitute Vanguard Municipal Intermediate and Vanguard
Municipal Limited-Term for the other two funds.
</P>
<P>
   FOR GOALS FEWER THAN TWO YEARS AWAY:
</P>
<P>
   Split your money equally between Strong Advantage (800-368-1030)
and Vanguard Money Market Prime (800-635-1511).

<TEXT>
<P>
   The stock market's turmoil over the past several months has been
unnerving to almost everyone. When is the turbulence going to stop?
Is the stock market safe? What are good funds to buy now?
</P>
<P>
   Such questions beset nearly all investors in times like these.
But investing in mutual funds can be the right choice _ even when
the market is heading down.
</P>
<P>
   And if you invest in fundamentally sound funds that have proven
themselves over the long haul, a market decline is really the best
time to invest, because stocks are cheaper.
 &UR; WHY PUT YOUR MONEY IN THE MARKET? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Given today's market turmoil, many people want to know: Which
way is the stock market headed next, and what can we expect in the
future?
</P>
<P>
   Alas, despite their frequent pronouncements, none of Wall
Street's highly paid analysts have more than a hunch about which
way the stock market will go today, tomorrow or six months from
now. In fact, you're probably better off paying no attention to
predictions about which way the market is going, because nobody
knows.
</P>
<P>
   Just one example of the experts' fallibility: In 1979, Business
Week ran a cover story: ``The Death of Equities.'' The story argued
that the stock market was never again going to offer the kind of
gains it had in the past. Three years later, the biggest bull
market in history began.
</P>
<P>
   While you should ignore the predictions, do bear this in mind:
Through recessions, wars and all other matter of calamities,
stocks, on average, have returned an annualized 11 percent since
1926. That compares to 5.4 percent for government bonds, and 3.7
percent for ``safe'' cash investments such as short-term Treasury
bills, bank certificates of deposits and money-market funds.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, inflation has averaged 3.1 percent. After inflation,
stocks have actually been less likely to lose money over five-year
periods than bonds or cash.
</P>
<P>
   Over all five-year periods since 1926, stocks have outperformed
bonds and cash more than three-quarters of the time.
</P>
<P>
   But before you put all your money into stocks, remember:
</P>
<P>
   _ Stocks are far more volatile than bonds, meaning their returns
bounce around more from month to month and year to year. Cash is
the least volatile investment.
</P>
<P>
   _ In their worst year (1931), stocks plunged 43 percent, while
long-term corporate bonds lost only 8.1 percent in their poorest
year (1969), and the worst return on cash was a minuscule loss of
0.02 percent (in 1938).
</P>
<P>
   _ Stocks have fallen by at least 20 percent about once every
five years since 1926. There's nothing unique about this year's
decline. On average, it has taken two years and five months to
break even for an investor who put money into stocks just before a
20 percent or greater drop.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1929 crash (when stocks lost 86 percent of their value
over three years), though, it took until 1944 to break even. And
after the brutal 1973-74 bear market (when stocks fell 48 percent),
it took more than three years to break even _ and 10 years to break
even after inflation.
</P>
<P>
   You get the idea: Stocks are great long-term investments; bonds
and cash make more sense for shorter time periods. Think of stocks
as a roller coaster, bonds as bumper cars and cash as a carousel.
And tune out prognostications about which will do best in the short
run.
 &UR; BEFORE YOU GET STARTED &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you've decided to invest in stock funds, there are a few
things you should do before getting started.
</P>
<P>
   First, make sure you pay off high-interest debt such as credit
cards. Next, amass a cash cushion equal to at least three months of
your after-tax salary in a bank CD or a money-market account. Or,
if you are bolder, take out a home-equity line of credit that you
can tap in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've taken those steps, there are two things you'll need
to determine about yourself: Can you tolerate fear-inspiring market
declines like the recent one without selling your stock funds? And
how long will it be until you'll need your money?
</P>
<P>
   To find out how much risk you can handle, answer the following
two questions:
</P>
<P>
   1. The news media is filled with stories quoting experts who
predict stocks will lose money in the coming decade. Many suggest
investing in real estate. You would:
</P>
<P>
   a. consider selling some stocks funds and buying real estate
</P>
<P>
   b. be concerned, but stick to your long-term goals
</P>
<P>
   c. dismiss the articles as a sign of unwarranted pessimism over
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   2. Which of the following statements best describes you:
</P>
<P>
   a. I often change my mind and have trouble sticking to a plan.
</P>
<P>
   b. I can stay with a strategy as long as it seems to be doing
well.
</P>
<P>
   c. Once I make up my mind to do something, I tend to follow
through with it regardless of the obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   If you answered ``a'' both times, consider yourself a low-risk
investor. If you answered with one ``a'' and one ``b,'' or two
``b's,'' or one ``a'' and one ``c,'' you're a medium-risk investor.
</P>
<P>
   If you answered with at least one ``c'' and no ``a's,'' you're a
high-risk investor _ able to hold on to stocks no matter how rough
the market gets.
 &UR; HOW MUCH OF YOUR MONEY SHOULD YOU INVEST IN STOCKS? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some stockbrokers and financial planners would have you believe
that figuring out how much to invest in stocks and lower-risk
investments is as difficult as calculus. Not so.
</P>
<P>
   Following are two tables: one for investing for retirement and
the second for investing to meet all other goals.
</P>
<P>
   The table for retirement calls for you to invest a larger
portion of your money in stocks. That's because most people can
expect to live to be 85 or 90 years old _ a long time for your
money to grow, even in retirement.
</P>
<P>

retirement or your age in retirement)

</P>
<P>
   Armed with this knowledge, and details that I'll give you on
which funds to buy in the next article, there's no need for you to
buy a fund with a sales charge, or to pay a stock broker or
financial adviser to help you select funds.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, once you become accustomed to the ups and downs of
the market, you may find you're more able to tolerate them. If so,
take the risk test again and see if you should increase the
percentage of your money you put into stock funds.
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR: GETTING STARTED &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to know you need to get started investing _ or
that you need to invest in a more methodical way. It's another
thing to actually pull the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Procrastination is the enemy of investors. You know all the
excuses: Either you don't have enough money, you'd rather spend it
on something else, the market seems too risky just now or you're
already so far behind that starting would be pointless.
</P>
<P>
   You'll feel better about making a move if, instead of plunging
in, you take a tentative step or two. Invest a modest but fixed
amount from your salary in shares of stock funds every month.
</P>
<P>
   Funds often allow a monthly (or quarterly) minimum investment of
as little as $25 or $50, as long as you agree to make regular,
automatic investments via your checking account. Having the fund
company take the money out of your bank account each month is a big
plus.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a 401(k) or 403(b) retirement plan at work, your
employer will similarly invest money straight from your paycheck.
And most companies match at least part of your investment, offering
an instant, substantial return.
</P>
<P>
   Money you don't see is money you won't spend and money you soon
will find you hardly miss. If you have to sit down and write a
check to a mutual fund every month, it's much easier to find
something else you'd rather spend the money on than your future.

A PLAY ABOUT GAY JESUS GIVES BLASPHEMY A BAD NAME 
</HEADLINE>
  By JACOB WEISBERG 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most electric moments in ``Corpus Christi'', Terrence
McNally's play about a gay Jesus, come when you arrive at the
theater.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, Catholic protesters in white berets recite
Hail Marys into a megaphone. If you approach the police barricade
that pens them in, they ply you with leaflets charging that the
play portrays ``the Blessed Virgin screaming obscenely to St.
Joseph for sexual relations'' (sadly, it doesn't).
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the controversy, the entire run at the 299 seat
Manhattan Theatre Club is sold out. Should you manage to lay hands
on a ticket, you have to run a gauntlet of burly security guards
and pass through an airport metal detector to get to your seat.
</P>
<P>
   The experience is disorienting _ part First Amendment vigil,
part X-rated movie. ``Corpus Christi'' became instantaneously
notorious in May, when the New York Post revealed that it depicted
a Jesus who has sex with his apostles. After receiving telephone
calls threatening violence, the Manhattan Theatre Club canceled the
production.
</P>
<P>
   But the play was reinstated a week later amid protests from
nearly every important dramatist in America and many elsewhere.
Since restoring the play, the Manhattan Theatre Club has been
congratulating itself on its fearless defense of free expression.
</P>
<P>
   What a letdown, then, to finally see ``Corpus Christi'' and
encounter neither blasphemy nor artistic courage. On the first
score, the play comes up short. It is not, in fact, a work of
savage (or even mild) anti-clericalism. There's no nudity or sex
onstage, and though the Vatican regards the notion of a noncelibate
gay Jesus as heretical, the playwright's intention is not
sacrilegious.
</P>
<P>
   McNally's updating of the life of Jesus is much in the spirit of
``Godspell'' _ if slightly more risque. But while there's nothing
very shocking about ``Corpus Christi'', its dramatic and
intellectual thinness is stunning. McNally's real offense is
invoking a great theme and an all-important principle for something
as trite and banal as this.
</P>
<P>
   The play is in essence a gay retelling of the Gospel. Thirteen
male actors perform a variety of parts in a series of sketches. In
the first, Joshua, a.k.a. Jesus, is born in a sleazy East Texas
motel room (the woman screaming for sex is on the other side of a
thin wall). At 1950s-era ``Pontius Pilate High'' in Corpus Christi,
Texas _ the town where McNally grew up _ Joshua is bullied into
playing football and taunted by his peers as a ``faggot.'' An
encounter in the school bathroom leads to an affair with a sinister
classmate named Judas.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, Joshua hitchhikes across the desert and has
occasional conversations with his dad, God. He performs miracles
and gathers disciples. One is a doctor, another an actor, another a
male prostitute. They go to gay discos and spread the Word. Joshua
performs a marriage for two of the apostles. After a scrumptious
Last Supper, Judas betrays him with a French kiss. On the cross,
Joshua is mocked as ``King of the Queers.''
</P>
<P>
   The staging and performances are competent, if uninspired. The
real limitations are those of the writer, whose hallmarks are weak
sophomoric humor and a cloying sentimentality. It's a gag line in
this play when someone exclaims ``Jesus H. Christ!'' Joseph opposes
naming his son Jesus, because people will thing he's a Mexican. ``I
hear hammering,'' Jesus tells his mother. ``Of course you do,'' she
says. ``Your father's a carpenter.''
</P>
<P>
   This is silly, and not really funny, but the intent is not to
ridicule. The spirit is rather one of camp reverence. McNally, who
was raised a Catholic, apparently considers himself in sympathy
with the deeper meaning of Christianity, which he boils down to an
injunction to be nice to everybody. His setting is supposed to
teach us that Jesus loves gay people, too.
</P>
<P>
   Lest anyone miss the point, one of the apostles appears onstage
to explain it to the audience after the crucifixion. ``If we have
offended, so be it,'' he declares. ``He belongs to us as well as
you.''
</P>
<P>
   This is weak Christian tea. Equally pallid is McNally's
stereotyped portrayal of gay people. Like many of his other plays,
``Corpus Christi'' seems like ethnic PR, in the vein of ``Fiddler
on the Roof'' or the movie ``Moonstruck.'' McNally wants to present
homosexuals to heterosexuals as witty and wonderful. Though his gay
characters aren't always perfect, the overall picture is of a
delightful bunch of fellas. Gay men have flair, taste and humor.
They love Callas and cooking. They are sensitive and deep.
</P>
<P>
   Where McNally fails time and again is by drawing gay people as
types rather than complex characters. Watch the clip from the film
version of ``Frankie and Johnny,'' for which McNally wrote the
screenplay based on his own theater play. Michelle Pfeiffer's gay
next-door neighbor, played by Nathan Lane, is a cut-up, whose jokes
are usually variations of the theme of being a man who likes other
men.
</P>
<P>
   In another McNally play-turned-film, the maudlin soap opera
``Love! Valour! Compassion!,'' Jason Alexander minces around, puts
on women's clothes and continually bursts into show tunes. Watch as
he riffs on those annoying heterosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Corpus Christi,'' the disciple characters are thinly
sketched versions of familiar cliches: the taciturn hairdresser,
the buff male hustler, the yuppie lawyer. This may be Bethlehem,
but it's still The Birdcage.
</P>
<P>
   By focusing on the fact that the play portrays a Christ who has
sex with his disciples, the press has encouraged a misconception
about McNally's work. Most people now assume that ``Corpus
Christi'' is an expression of ACT-UP-style radicalism _ the theater
of queer outrage performed with an NEA grant. But McNally wants to
enlarge the bourgeoisie, not ``epater'' it. ``Corpus Christi,''
like his other plays, is a work of unchallenging, middlebrow
subscription theater on a touchy theme.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's nothing wrong with middlebrow theater if done
well. Neil Simon has his place. But Neil Simon doesn't congratulate
his audience for being brave enough to laugh at his jokes. And Neil
Simon can be funny.

WHAT CHURCHILL KNEW 
</HEADLINE>
  By JUDITH SHULEVITZ and KATE GALBRAITH 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Conquering troops swagger into towns, round up members of an
undesirable ethnic population, and systematically slaughter them.
The world knows all about it but dithers anyway. Not for years
after they first learn of the pattern of atrocities do they do
anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar? We're not talking Kosovo or Bosnia here. We're
talking about the war which taught the Serbs just how much horror
an occupier can get away with.
</P>
<P>
   One of the many unpleasant duties of Holocaust historians
involves rounding out the portrait of Allied indifference to the
genocide of the Jews during World War II. Richard Breitman, a
historian at American University, has just added some new details
to that picture.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, ``Official Secrets: What The Nazis Planned, What
the British and Americans Knew'' (Hill and Wang), he argues that
the British were made fully aware of the Nazi plan to wipe out the
Jews as early as January 1942 _ half a year earlier than previously
thought.
</P>
<P>
   Breitman's argument, based on recently declassified British
intelligence documents, goes as follows:
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1939, British decoders unscrambled radio signals
from German special police units. Messages intercepted from the
Eastern Front in September 1941 showed that these units were
following behind the army and rounding up vast numbers of Jews in
the Soviet Union. The decoders knew something about Nazi
terminology by then, so they understood that ``special duties'' or
``pacification'' meant something much worse than relocation.
</P>
<P>
   They'd also heard enough to know that it was a campaign planned
before the invasion of the Soviet Union, not some random byproduct
of war. This intelligence rose all the way up to British Foreign
Minister Anthony Eden, who quashed it, and Winston Churchill, who
enfolded it in grandiose speeches about mass execution that didn't
quite explain what was occurring.
</P>
<P>
   What difference would this information have made? The difference
the confirmation of rumor always makes. Had the world known for
certain that the incredible stories coming from the Soviet Union
were true, more Jews could have been warned. Neutral and satellite
states could have been pressured to accept more refugees, years
sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the war, the British intelligence reports could have
helped pin the blame on the right people. During the Nuremberg
trials, for instance, prosecutors misclassified the special police
units largely responsible for the slaughter on the Eastern Front as
run-of-the-mill policemen, rather than as the mass murderers they
were.
</P>
<P>
   The future mass murderers of the world surely drew the obvious
moral lesson.

THE LAND OF THE FEE 
</HEADLINE>
  By WALTER SHAPIRO

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   During a series of late-night dinners with candidates and
campaign operatives _ both Democrats and Republicans _ we have
picked up assorted off-the-record anecdotes about the most taboo
topic in politics.
</P>
<P>
   This dirty secret is not about how candidates raise money, but
how they are forced to spend it.
</P>
<P>
   Say you are Morrow E. Pure, running for an open House seat in a
swing district. By begging and pleading for six hours a day on the
telephone for months, you have managed to raise $500,000, the
rock-bottom estimate to conduct a credible congressional race. But
almost half of that money will be funneled right into the pockets
of consultants before you get to air your first 30-second bio spot.
</P>
<P>
   (Here's the script: ``Entrepreneur and father of six, Morrow E.
Pure shares your values--family values--and in Washington will be
on your side fighting for seniors, fighting for families and
fighting for a better future for our kids.'')
</P>
<P>
   Let's follow the money as it disappears:
</P>
<P>
   Right after you win the primary in your district, you fly to
Washington to get sophisticated political advice from your party's
congressional campaign committee. They tell you to immediately
spend $15,000 on a baseline poll in your district.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opponent and I are both unknowns,'' you protest.
``Shouldn't we wait to poll until the race heats up in
mid-October?'' The political pros, rolling their eyes at your
naivete, explain that the sole purpose of this poll is to impress
the Washington PAC community.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, your $15,000 survey shows that Morrow E. Pure has low name
ID. Unimpressed, the PAC community tells you, ``Take a walk, kid.''
Disappearing money: $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   The wise heads at the national campaign committee, worried about
your ability to raise money, direct you to one of the party's
leading fund-raising consultants. With dollar signs dancing in your
brain, you sign a contract promising the consultants 15 percent of
what they raise _ along with $10,000 to purchase lists and, say, a
$6,000 a month retainer.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, during your first conference call with the
fund-raising consultants, they explain that they have run into an
unexpected snag: The word is out in Washington that you can't win
because your own poll shows that you have low name ID.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the firm helps you raise $200,000. Sounds like a
good deal, nonetheless. Not when you subtract the costs: $30,000
for commissions; $20,000 total for lists; $24,000 for the monthly
retainer; $10,000 for a second, inconclusive, poll; and $16,000 for
miscellaneous costs like repeated trips to Washington to get the
brush off from PACs. Disappearing money: $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   But like your pioneer ancestors who settled this district, you
are not deterred by adversity. You take control of your own
financial destiny by importuning everyone you have met in your
life. On your own, you manage to raise another $300,000, all
earmarked for a TV blitz.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly. There are $20,000 in production costs for the
TV spots; $12,000 for the media consultant's monthly retainer; and,
$8,000 for a third poll to identify campaign themes (Answer:
Combating low name ID). So another, far more justifiable, $40,000
is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Still, $260,000 can buy a lot of TV time to show that Morrow E.
Pure is fighting for the future. Except, it's not exactly $260,000.
There is that little item called the ``ad placement fee,'' which
amounts to 15 percent of all TV billings, paid to the media
consultant. (Presidential campaigns often negotiate this ad fee
down to as low as 7 percent.) So wave farewell to another $39,000.
</P>
<P>
   By our reckoning (and we freely admits that many of these
calculations are rough guesses), Morrow E. Pure has been bludgeoned
into paying nearly $200,000 in vigorish to the political rackets.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that most campaign consultants see nothing wrong
with a system that everyone else deplores. As long as the political
handlers are raking off their ample share, who cares if nobody
votes?

GIVING THE INVISIBLE HAND A HAND 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wading through the reams of commentary on the ``global economic
crisis,'' what you're struck by again and again is just how
confused everyone is.
</P>
<P>
   This is a dramatic change in a very short period of time. When
people said that U.S.-style capitalism had triumphed, after all,
what they meant was not merely that U.S.-style capitalism was
spreading across the globe. They also meant that it had triumphed
intellectually, that the truths which underpinned it were
unimpeachable.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's possible to explain almost everything that's happened
in the global economy over the last year as evidence not of the
failure of markets but rather of what happens when markets aren't
able to operate freely. It's possible, but not convincing. The
hedge fund Long Term Capital Management was as unregulated an
entity as could be imagined, and its failure nearly sent the entire
global marketplace into a tailspin. And if Brazil ends up
collapsing in the next few months, it will be because global
investors decided that they couldn't make money there. That's a
collective decision which could precipitate a global slowdown, and
if it happens it will be because the market's responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that, of course, doesn't mean that there are any easy
solutions to what's going on. One can recognize that markets fail
and still not be sure how to keep them from failing and still
believe that there's no real alternative which can deliver the kind
of economic growth enjoyed by Asia and Latin America in the last
decade.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion that prevails among policymakers today is
precisely a confusion about this subject. Investors aren't acting
the way they're supposed to _ coolly measuring return against risk
_ and policymakers don't know how to make them act appropriately.
(The mere fact that the question of how to restore rationality to
markets is being raised is, of course, a challenge to conventional
neoclassical economic theory, since investors are always supposed
to act rationally.)
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, long-accepted truths about the benefits of
free capital flow and the value of speculation are being seriously
questioned. For the first time since the 1970s, a genuine debate
exists.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of this was the op-ed piece on Long Term Capital in
Monday's Wall Street Journal. The piece was co-authored by Daniel
Fishel, an astute advocate of efficient-market theory, opponent of
all government intervention in the marketplace and a vocal defender
of Michael Milken. Fishel sees the Long Term bailout as an example
of markets taking care of one of their own. The hedge fund's
lenders stepped in to take over the firm, Long Term's investors
bore all the risk, and the Federal Reserve merely played a role in
making the process run more smoothly. Any call for regulation of
hedge funds, Fishel argues, is therefore misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   No surprises there. What's interesting, though, is that Fishel
recognizes that Long Term's creditors may very well have bailed out
the hedge fund because they realized ``the possible broader harms
that might result from (its) hedge fund.'' In other words, instead
of just looking only to their individual interests, Goldman Sachs,
et. al. thought about the ``systemic risk'' of Long Term's failure
and acted accordingly. Fishel hails this as ``all the better and
all the more remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   But what's really remarkable is that Fishel believes it's
necessary or rational for investors to think about the collective
interest in making their individual economic decisions. The whole
point of the invisible hand, after all, is that it's supposed to
turn private vice into public virtue. If everyone just looks after
themselves, things will turn out OK. Here, though, Fishel is saying
that what's ``remarkable'' about the bailout is that Wall Street
looked out for everyone else, and so everything turned out OK.
</P>
<P>
   But if we need someone to look out for everyone else, it should
surely be the government, which we have some measure of control
over, and not a group of investment banks.
</P>
<P>
   It may be, in the end, that we decide that the invisible hand
really is the best way to get out of this. But if we don't decide
that, then we need real regulation, and not an ad hoc reliance on
the momentary benevolence of the powerhouses on Wall Street.

WHOSE GOD IS IT, ANYWAY? 
</HEADLINE>
  By CULLEN MURPHY 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 1956 swords-and-sandals epic ``The Ten Commandments'' has
long since turned into a pillar of kitsch, but certain moments in
the movie remain improbably vivid. One is the sneering query put by
the slave master Edward G. Robinson to the humbled Israelite leader
Charlton Heston: ``Where is your God now, Moses?''
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the use of a personal pronoun before ``God'' signaled
a clash of civilizations: The outlook of the whole Nilotic world
was being contrasted with that of the whole Chosen People.
Similarly, the our in Martin Luther's stirring anthem ``A Mighty
Fortress Is Our God'' takes for granted the cultural cohesiveness
of the God concept.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the personal pronouns my, his, her, their, and our are
being deployed before ``God'' as never before: Such locutions have
become a pervasive social trope. But it's hard to pin down just
what they now signify. A new polytheism? A divinely sanctioned
solipsism?
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent recent example comes from Bill Clinton's Aug.
17 speech to the nation: ``Now this matter is between me and the
two people I love most _ my wife and our daughter _ and our God.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, of course, broke no new rhetorical ground here. I have
seen references to issues that lie ``between me, my scale, and our
God'' (an article about dieting); ``me, my stylist, and our God''
(an article about hair care); and ``me and the officer with the
radar trap and our God'' (an article about highway speeding). The
attorney Alan Dershowitz has stated that a lawyer should not have a
position about a client's guilt: ``His guilt is a matter for him
and his God.''
</P>
<P>
   The legend on American coins proclaims, ``In God We Trust.'' The
president taking the oath of office has historically spoken the
words ``so help me God.'' But if the evidence of common speech is
any guide, the idea of God has been rapidly devolving from the
generalized to the particular, from the awesomely abstract to the
intensely (even idiosyncratically) personal.
</P>
<P>
   There has always been a tension between these two concepts of
God. I brought the matter up with Jack Miles, whose book, ``God: A
Biography,'' won the 1996 Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction. Miles sets
the situation into historical context: ``What made the fortune, so
to speak, of the God of Israel,'' he observes, ``was that he
combined two functions previously separate: on the one hand, the
function of the Mesopotamian personal God, a kind of guardian angel
whose responsibilities were concentrated on one man or woman but
whose powers were also limited; on the other, the function of the
Canaanite/Mesopotamian high God, El, whose attention to any
individual man or woman was slight or unpredictable but whose
powers were universal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before this historic synthesis, you got either one or the
other. After it, you had the electrifying possibility that the top
God was also our God and even my personal God. After it, of course,
you also had the whole range of unanswerable questions of the sort
'How could a good God _ and El was an essentially benign, judgelike
figure _ permit X to happen to us, or to me?'''
</P>
<P>
   Is the ``top God''-''my God'' synthesis coming undone? Even as a
great deal of the ``top God'' discussion drifts into remote realms
of cosmology, much of the ``my God'' discussion becomes ever more
individualized.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelical Protestantism has especially cherished the notion of
a personal God, and this continues to be reflected in the heartfelt
speech of ordinary people and even of nonbelievers. (Recall the
reaction of Lt. Scheisskopf's wife, in ``Catch 22,'' to Yossarian's
famous tirade against God. Yossarian asks why she is so upset,
since she doesn't believe in God to begin with. She replies, ``But
the God I don't believe in is a good God, a just God, a merciful
God.'')
</P>
<P>
   The personal God of the sincerely born-again Christian bears
little resemblance to a different sort of personalized God, the
customized kind that one acquires as one might a personal trainer,
though the workouts often are not as strenuous. This latter sort of
personalized God may amount at best to a synonym for ``conscience''
or ``serenity.''
</P>
<P>
   The dark analogs of the personalized God are one's personal
demons--which represent the individually customized version of what
used to go by the nontechnical terms Bad Behavior or Guilt or
simply Evil.
</P>
<P>
   Another form the personal God may take involves a fragmentation
of the concept of divinity itself. Thus, writing in The New Yorker
in December 1996, Louis Menand posited the breakdown of traditional
monotheism into ``genetic polytheism,'' in which personal behavior
is attributable to an individualized genetic pantheon. Where once
there was a God of Anger, now there is a gene of aggression. Where
once there was a God of Wine, now there is a gene of alcoholism. In
ancient Greece, Phobos was the God of Fear. Today he is gene
SLC6A4, whose specific Olympian dwelling place is chromosome 17q12.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the God module, which is not so much
polytheistic as polymorphous. According to researchers at the
University of California at San Diego, there is a region of the
temporal lobe the stimulation of which, sometimes manifested in the
form of seizures, can now be correlated with certain intangible
mental experiences. One of the California researchers, Vilayanur S.
Ramachandran, making public his team's findings late last year at
the annual meeting of the Society of Neuroscience, stated, ``We
like to suggest there may be neural circuits in the temporal lobe
that may be part of the machinery of the brain that is involved in
mystical experiences and God.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers have christened these neural circuits the ``God
module.'' ``Now this is a matter between me, the two people I love
most ... and our god modules.'' We have not heard these words yet,
the Lord be praised.

   CANCER-INSURANCE (Seattle) Teri Lafnitzegger, a 37-year-old
mother of two, was recently diagnosed with a brain tumor and told
by her Group Health doctor that her only chance was a unique
neurosurgical procedure offered by Duke University. She was
referred by her doctor and supposed to get the $100,000 surgery
this week, when Group Health at the last minute refused to cover it
as ``experimental.'' Her doctors at Duke say Group Health is
technically right, but wrong to deny coverage. Most insurers are
paying for this, they say, because it's the only chance for such
tumors. Some patients given months to live have survived for years.
``The clock is ticking on this woman,'' said Dr. Henry Friedman of
Duke. ``What's the problem with this insurance company?'' The Duke
procedure has good data and may be saving lives. PHOTO.

WOMAN DENIED BEST HOPE FOR TUMOR BY INSURANCE CO. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (Photo available through Wieck Photo Database)  
 By TOM PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A Kitsap County, Wash., woman suffering from a
fast-growing and highly lethal brain tumor has been denied
insurance coverage for a procedure she believes offers her the only
chance of survival.
</P>
<P>
   Teri Lafnitzegger, a 37-year-old wife and mother of two in
Olalla, wants Group Health Cooperative to pay for a unique
neurosurgical procedure available only at Duke University Medical
Center in Durham, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Lafnitzegger has glioblastoma, an almost invariably fatal brain
tumor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said I have nine months,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clock is ticking on this woman,'' said Dr. Henry Friedman,
a surgeon at Duke who performs the procedure involving radioactive
antibodies. Surgery for Lafnitzegger had been scheduled for
yesterday, but the operation was canceled when Group Health
officials said they would not pay the $100,000 cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drug they use is not FDA-approved . . . and there's not
much published literature on this,'' said Dr. Hugh Straley, an
administrator and oncologist at Group Health in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman truly believes he has the best approach to treating
glioblastomas, Straley said, but the opinion of one doctor or even
one medical center isn't proof enough. Lafnitzegger can appeal the
decision, he said, and because of the medical urgency that appeal
will be expedited.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do it in a matter of days,'' Straley said.
</P>
<P>
   The broader question, he said, has to do with who should pay for
unproven therapies.
</P>
<P>
   For Lafnitzegger, the answer is simple. ``It's the only chance I
have,'' she said. ``Even if all they can do is help me live another
year, that's reason enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Lafnitzegger, who with her husband, Eric, has two boys, ages 4
and 6, has perhaps the most aggressive and deadliest of brain
tumors, known as glioblastoma multiforme. She's had brain surgery
to remove some of the tumor and external beam radiation therapy,
but the cancer persists.
</P>
<P>
   When it appeared that there was little more to be done for her
at Group Health, she and her doctor began exploring the unique
neurosurgical procedure at Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Lafnitzegger said her physician at Group Health Cooperative in
Tacoma ordered the tests required by Duke's Comprehensive Cancer
Center and her oncologist agreed to refer her.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they had to cancel the surgery because Group Health
was refusing to pay,'' Lafnitzegger said. She was stunned, scared
and angry. The cooperative called Duke to cancel the surgery but
didn't call her, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Straley said Lafnitzegger was not referred to Duke. Her
physician only agreed to explore this option, Straley said, which
was somehow misconstrued by Duke as a referral and authorization
for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of many investigational therapies,'' he said. It
would be irresponsible for Group Health to authorize coverage for
an unproven treatment based on one patient's or one doctor's
assessment, he said. Straley said standard procedure calls for
chemotherapy following surgery and radiation therapy.
</P>
<P>
   But he admits that survival rates for patients who receive
standard care is terrible. ``Most patients die of this in 18
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman said Group Health's refusal is a knee-jerk response
insurers use when asked to pay for any new therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer they stall, the more likely it is she won't be a
candidate,'' he said. ``The clock favors the insurance company. . .
. She may not have weeks . . . They know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman thinks he can give Lafnitzegger more time, perhaps a
lot more.
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina cancer specialists employ a new twist on a
standard approach to treating this form of brain tumor using
radioactive antibodies to target and kill cancer cells. It's
investigational, Friedman acknowledged, but patients are already
surviving much longer than expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our patients appear to be beating the odds,'' Friedman said.
One of his first patients was given a year to live _ nearly five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be five years on Dec. 9,'' said Susan Feinglos,
director of the medical library at Duke. She had a relatively large
tumor in her right frontal lobe and was told by her physician
husband not to read the medical literature on glioblastoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one lived,'' Feinglos said. ``It was pretty gloomy.''
</P>
<P>
   She won't claim to be cured, but Feinglos has so far shown no
signs of recurrent cancer. Not all of the patients at Duke do so
well. Many die anyway, but Friedman contended it's worth the
estimated $100,000 even if all they can do is give someone like
Lafnitzegger a year or two longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see my youngest son enter kindergarten,''
Lafnitzegger said.
</P>
<P>
   The Duke therapy is an improvement on standard therapy, Friedman
said, but he contended it doesn't increase the cost of treating
glioblastoma because they don't charge for the experimental
antibody.
</P>
<P>
   In the procedure, surgeons go in and remove as much of the tumor
as possible. Into the surgically created ``crater'' in the brain,
doctors place a tube. After the crater is tested for leaks using
tracer isotopes, a chamber containing a cancer-killing liquid
iodine solution is connected to the tube.
</P>
<P>
   The liquid contains monoclonal antibodies that have been
manufactured to target specific tumor proteins and that carry
radioactive iodine-131.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use liquid iodine because we figured we'd get a more
homogeneous distribution and less radiation damage to healthy
tissue,'' Friedman said.
</P>
<P>
   In a study published last June in the Journal of Clinical
Oncology, the Duke team, led by Dr. Darell Bigner, reported on the
increased survival time among patients with glioblastoma treated in
this fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman, who works with Bigner, noted that many private
insurers helped pay for the patients in that study. As examples, he
cited Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, Aetna, Prudential, Cigna,
Travelers and even state Medicaid programs in New York and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a disease is terminal and the patient has no other choice,
many insurers cover it,'' Friedman said.

   SEATTLE _ Whenever a clerk asks to see my driver's license, I
say: ``OK, but only if you promise (begin italics) not (end
italics) to laugh at the picture!''
</P>
<P>
   This of course predisposes them to do just that. Some start
giggling even before I reach into my wallet for the license. Or,
they smile when they see the typical police lineup photo. And they
condescendingly say something like: ``Oh, (begin italics) that's
(end italics) not so bad!''
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes they even volunteer: ``You oughta see mine!'' Of
course, very few ever reach into their own wallet or purse to
display their own version of what the Department of Licensing
thinks is a reasonable likeness.
</P>
<P>
   We are, to a person, locked inside our own person. Despite all
the wonders of plastic or corrective surgery, collagen injections,
miracle creams, dietary supplements, artificial tanning and
expensive cosmetics, we are the same guy or gal we came in with.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, we're the spitting image of our parents. I'm not,
which has from the start occasioned whispered conversations about
what our mother might've been doing while my father was out on the
road as a traveling salesman . . . a quirky twist on a standard
joke format.
</P>
<P>
   Neither do I look anything like my twin sister _ something for
which she should be eternally grateful. In fact, although she has
hair on top of her head, neither of us looks anything like our two
older siblings. But the whispers have died down by now and there's
no sense going there.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us, for a variety of mostly vain reasons, affect the
Very Northwest hirsute countenance. And as the ``Wanted'' photo at
the top of this column vividly shows, a beard and/or mustache
cannot truly hide nor much enhance what our genes set in place.
</P>
<P>
   I have, on occasion, come clean by clearcutting the beard and
mustache. And on some of those occasions, the editors bothered to
have the column photo reshot. My late mother, never one to mince
words, saw one of those clean-shaven column photos and told me in
our next telephone conversation: ``You know, you never were a very
handsome guy. I think you should grow it all back.''
</P>
<P>
   She should've lived long enough to read the latest news release
about a University of Louisville plastic surgery researcher who
predicts that complete face transplants might be possible within a
few months.
</P>
<P>
   That gives a whole new meaning, a really scary context to the
driver's license section that declares ``organ donor.'' You don't
get to see someone's liver or kidneys or heart or whatever part you
might be hoping for _ and that's just as well, perhaps. But with
the possibility of complete facial transplants, what you see on the
driver's license photo is what you get.
</P>
<P>
   And let's face it . . . do you know (begin italics) anyone (end
italics) whose countenance you might want, based on their driver's
license photo?
</P>
<P>
   If you've seen the movie ``Face/Off,'' you knew it was already
possible. I'm not sure what their mothers would've thought, but
then, Nicolas Cage and John Travolta already had their faces
merchandised into millions. And as we movie viewers get older, it's
comforting to see Travolta's face, in particular, become rounder .
. . just like our own.
</P>
<P>
   And Cage's nose seems larger . . . just as my own.
</P>
<P>
   This is the time of year everyone toys with the idea of renting
or buying a particularly eye-catching (so-to-speak) Halloween mask.
I haven't taken the time to research whether there are any Bill
Clinton ``What, Me Worry?'' masks. Or any Monica Whatzername masks.
And if I were going out to a Halloween party in a Ken Starr mask, I
think I'd wear a Kevlar vest under my cloak and let someone else
start my car.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is to belittle the legitimate and downright
wonderful facial reconstruction surgeries done for accident, birth
defect or disease victims. But I think we make too much out of how
we look. We are too quick to assess the book by its cover, even if
it's what we see in the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   As a youngster, I used to stand in front of the bathroom mirror
and contort my face into grotesque masks. And that same mother used
to warn: ``If you keep doing that, someday it's going to stay that
way!''
</P>
<P>
   Don't you just hate it when it turns out they were right?

 IN MEETING McVEIGH'S FAMILY, A GRIEVING FATHER FINDS PEACE   
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the aftermath of his daughter's death in the
Oklahoma City bombings, Bud Welch wanted nothing less of the
killers than ``to see them fry.'' Had anyone told him then that he
would one day travel almost 2,000 miles to meet the father and
sister of one of the convicted killers, to embrace them and weep
with them, Welch would have thought that person insane.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, that is exactly what the 59-year-old Oklahoma City Texaco
station owner did last month. Moved by the pain he said he saw in
Bill McVeigh's face, Welch asked to visit the father of convicted
bomber Timothy McVeigh and McVeigh's 24 year-old sister, Jennifer.
He spent about 90 minutes with them, sitting at their kitchen table
in suburban Buffalo, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got ready to leave, Jennifer hugged me and then she
just took to sobbing,'' Welch said by phone from Oklahoma City. ``I
put my hands on her cheeks and held her face and said, `Honey, the
three of us are in this together for the rest of our lives. We can
make the most of it if we choose. I don't want your brother to die,
and I'll do what I can to help.'''
</P>
<P>
   Welch's help is showing itself in an advocacy we rarely see from
people who have lost loved ones to violent crimes: He's become a
public opponent of McVeigh's death sentence and the death penalty
in general. So far the work has thrust him before lawyers,
religious groups and college students. He even debated a pro-death
penalty Catholic theologian for part of an Odyssey Channel series
at Notre Dame University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the third-oldest of eight kids, born about 35 miles from
Oklahoma City and raised on a dairy farm,'' Welch said. ``I've run
a service station for 34 years. High school is it for me. But all
of a sudden I got pitched into this public speaking. Hell, you're
not prepared. But I just stand up there and tell people my story.''
</P>
<P>
   That story is one of philosophical death and resurrection. A
Catholic, Welch spent his life talking a good game against capital
punishment. The death of his 23-year-old daughter, Julie Marie
Welch, shattered that tidy, intellectual perspective. A Spanish
translator for the Social Security Administration, Julie was one of
168 people killed in the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal
Building on April 19, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so proud of her. I bragged on her all the time and it
embarrassed her. But she was such a wonderful kid; she had so much
to offer the world. The rescuers told me that if she'd have just
had another 2 or 3 seconds to get back to her office, she'd have
survived,'' Welch said.
</P>
<P>
   For several months after the bombing, all Welch wanted was to
see the people responsible for Julie's death pay with their own
lives. He was sorry there even had to be a trial: ``I was filled
with so much rage, revenge and hate. Once they were identified and
charged, all I thought was, `Fry 'em.' That was the insanity I went
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, one cold January day, he went to stand by an old American
elm tree that Julie used to try to park her car under on hot days.
Across a parking lot from the Murrah building, it is the only close
object that survived the blast. (Two clones have been grown from
the tree and countless seedlings given to other victims' families.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to think about how miserable I was,'' Welch said.
``I was smoking three packs of cigarettes a day and drinking too
much, and I didn't like myself. I wanted to know: After they
(McVeigh and Terry Nichols) were tried and executed, how was that
going to help me? I struggled with that question for two or three
weeks. And I finally realized, it ain't going to help at all. It
sure won't bring Julie Marie back. Revenge, hatred and rage _
that's why Julie Marie is dead today.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago Welch got a call from a Catholic nun who does
prison ministry in Attica in New York. He told her he would like to
meet with Bill McVeigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to tell him to his face that I care about what he's
going through,'' Welch said. ``I first saw him on television; he
was this plain, unassuming-looking man like myself. But I saw the
pain. Maybe it wasn't visible to others, but it was to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the nun put Welch in touch with people from
McVeigh's Catholic parish, and they set up a September meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked that nobody from the media know about it. I wanted it
to be a personal thing,'' Welch said. ``When we drove out there, I
was really hoping we wouldn't find the house. I was so nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   But Welch asked about McVeigh's garden (he'd been told there was
a substantial one behind the family's modest, frame house), and the
two men spent about a half-hour walking through it and talking
about farming. ``It was kind of common ground, you know?'' Welch
said. Then they went inside and sat at the kitchen table. On a
nearby wall was Timothy McVeigh's high school graduation picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `God, what a good-looking kid,' and this tear came
rolling out of Bill's right eye. I felt so bad for him,'' Welch
said. ``He's worked for General Motors for 36 years. He's just
another slug out there like I am, working for a living. He's six
months younger than I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Welch said he cried for 20 miles as he drove back to town, then
``just bawled for an hour'' when he met up again with the people
who'd arranged the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to Mass every week, but I'm not an overly-religious
person,'' he said. ``I'm not a born-again Christian _ I don't even
know what the hell that means. I've done some crap in my life. But
I've somehow felt closer to God than I ever have since I met with
Bill and Jennifer. It was the most satisfying thing I've done in my
life. It brought me so much peace, I can't tell you _ and I'd
recommend it for anybody who's been in a similar situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Except Welch knows most people who have had his experience don't
want his recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's eight or 10 families who are still so filled with
revenge, it's like, `You're not one of us anymore, Bud.' People
still think you can get closure or healing from revenge, but you
can't. I've had a really deep hole in my heart since Julie was
killed. A big chunk of me is just gone forever. But killing Tim
McVeigh isn't going to grow the chunk back.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Notre Dame debate with the pro-death penalty theologian,
Welch said he asked the man the same question he asks of every
person who claims to be a Christian in favor of capital punishment:
``I just ask, `Would Jesus pull the switch?' Nobody can say yes.''

THE ASIAN-AMERICAN POWER PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM WONG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ California Treasurer Matt Fong's candidacy for
the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Barbara Boxer is one
indicator of the growing desire of Asian Americans for national
political power. Another is a quixotic movement launched in Foster
City last month by a high-profile group of Chinese Americans led by
former University of California at Berkeley Chancellor Chang-lin
Tien and former Delaware Lt. Gov. S.B. Woo, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The movement calls itself the 80/20 Initiative because its lofty
goal is to channel 80 percent of the Chinese-American (and perhaps
Asian-American) vote and political contributions from California,
New York, and New Jersey to the next major party presidential
candidate who will commit to the group's demands. Those demands
include increasing significant policy-making appointments in the
current Democratic administration and, for the majority
congressional Republicans, holding hearings to investigate why
Asian Americans aren't better represented in federal policy-making
positions, as well as in the upper ranks of corporate and academic
life.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate and party that agree to support the 80/20
Initiative will get the Asian-American community's votes and
contributions, the group's leaders say. Otherwise, such support
will be withheld.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, leaders of the 80/20 Initiative want to break the
glass ceiling they say has kept Asian Americans from gaining a fair
share of national power.
</P>
<P>
   The 50 Chinese Americans from all over the country who convened
in the San Francisco area several weeks ago issued a manifesto and
raised more than $50,000 to hire staff to implement their idea,
which is both provocative and pie-in-the-sky. The initiative will
attempt to get grassroots support through e-mail petition and
information campaigns. Woo pointed out that a smaller-scale effort
10 years ago yielded some high-level appointments in the Bush
administration.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the 80/20 Initiative, one must recall the history
of political disenfranchisement of the Asian-American population.
Until the end of World War II, most Asian Americans never had full
rights of U.S. citizenship. The population has risen to almost 4
percent of the U.S. population from less than 1 percent 30 years
ago. Asian Americans make up about 12 percent of California's 32
million people and more than a third of San Francisco's population.
</P>
<P>
   Many among the emerging Asian-American immigrant class are well
educated professionals who are perceived to be technically gifted
and economically astute, but not possessed of political leadership
skills. Tien, Woo and the other founders of 80/20 disagree with
that stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although Asian Americans account for 3.5 percent of the U.S.
population, we represent less than 1 percent of the top
policy-making officials in the federal government and less than 1
percent of the federal judges,'' the group's statement said. ``Not
coincidentally, Asian Americans have only one-third the
opportunities of other Americans to rise to policy-making positions
in the corporate world, academia, and other private sectors. This
is in spite of the fact that the percentage of Asian Americans
having college degrees is twice the national average.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recognizing that Asian Americans are an important part of
America's social fabric and are a significant contributor to the
economy, we believe it is only proper that Asian Americans be able
to participate as equal members in all facets of American life,
including leadership roles in corporations, academia, and
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Tien said the goal is to first unite Chinese Americans, then try
to bring together other Asian Americans. ``As individual
communities, our voices have been ineffective in the political
arena. Together, we shall overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be a Sisyphean task, given the disparate political,
economic, cultural, religious and historical perspectives of
Asian-American groups.
</P>
<P>
   Alicia Wang, a San Franciscan and vice chairwoman of the
California Democratic Party _ who didn't attend the 80/20
Initiative meeting _ applauded the effort, but raised a caution
flag. ``It's wonderful they are raising the issue (of increasing
political power),'' she said. ``It's a great first step, but we
tend to get stuck on that bottom step.''

DESPITE OUTRAGE, GOP MAY HAVE THE EDGE IN ELECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The vote by the House of Representatives to
conduct an inquiry into possible impeachment was historic because
Bill Clinton joined the short list of presidents so entailed. But
the transparently political nature of this undertaking was
self-evident in the hours of debate preceding the vote and in the
vote itself.
</P>
<P>
   Very much unlike the vote on President Richard Nixon in
Watergate, which was overwhelmingly bipartisan, the one against
Bill Clinton was mostly on party lines. All the Republicans voted
for their more encompassing investigation; all the Democrats, save
31, voted against it. Most Democrats voted for a more defined and
restricted version.
</P>
<P>
   These votes constitute a distinct public service. Now the nation
can deal with the ridiculous charges for consideration of
impeachment, drawn entirely from a consensual sexual relationship,
in the framework and the spirit in which they were contrived:
politics.
</P>
<P>
   More than by the pious lip service in the debate upholding
constitutional integrity in the face of popular preferences for
alternative resolution, this will be settled by how many seats the
Republicans pick up in the mid-term elections Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have used the impeachment discussions to energize
their core supporters, the hard right-wingers who despised Clinton
before Monica Lewinsky. The affair and efforts to cover it up
merely fueled already powerful passions that could not abide that
Clinton was elected despite their wishes twice in a row.
</P>
<P>
   As the elections will go, so will impeachment. If the
Republicans make gains of 10 to 20 in the House (depending on which
Republican politico's figures you accept), then the impeachment
process is expected to result in a House vote, again on strictly
party lines, in favor of articles for Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   If Republicans do less well, then the possibilities of a
political compromise become more substantial, which means a deal
for some sort of censure or rebuke and the halting of the
impeachment express.
</P>
<P>
   In this political game, the Republicans have the edge going in.
First of all, non-presidential elections tend to produce lower
voter response. As there are more Democrats than Republicans in the
country as whole, that means fewer of Clinton's natural supporters
might show up.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans enjoy a major advantage in the November election
because their committed supporters tend to actually show up at the
polls to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the party occupying the White House tends to lose
some seats at the mid-term. Democrats earlier had showed promise of
making gains, because of the low esteem in which the
Republican-controlled Congress was held. But that was before
Clinton's reckless behavior impaired those expectations.
</P>
<P>
   So the issue becomes pretty clear: If matters remain as they
are, the Republicans will gain possibly sufficient numbers to push
impeachment. If Democrats wish to forestall that result, they have
to get out their voters in numbers uncharacteristic for an off-year
poll.
</P>
<P>
   This would be hard, according to conventional wisdom, because
Clinton has disheartened and discouraged Democrats. On the other
hand, the blatant partisanship of the House in the Lewinsky matter
and the persistently overwhelming desire, expressed repeatedly by
the people at large, including nominal Republicans, to get this
mess behind us, provide possibilities for the Democrats to exploit.
</P>
<P>
   However, they have to get started. So far, there are few if any
signs that the Democrats are launching any noticeable efforts.
James Carville, the outspoken former Clinton White House staffer
and campaign director, loudly complained last week that the
Democratic Party in Congress and out is too decorous and diffident
with the Republicans in general and House Speaker Newt Gingrich in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   Party worthies worry that the aggressively obnoxious Carville
will hamper the party's attempt to present itself as less partisan
than the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the next days will tell us the likely scenario
that will confront the nation regarding Clinton's fate. In the end,
as in the beginning, it will be a matter of party politics, shaped
by whoever winds up with the perceived mandate from November's
vote.
</P>
<P>
   While the hallowed cliche is that all politics is local, this
year local politics will be seen as turning on Clinton's
presidency. It is in the vicissitudes of political warfare, that
the profoundest implications for future presidencies will be
determined. Just as the Founders and Framers of this nation feared
might happen, impeachment has come down to the exercise of
political muscle to define what constitutes a ``high crime and
misdemeanor.''

NEW AND NOTABLE BOOKS

<P>
   A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; CHARITY &QL; 
 &UR; Mark Richard (Doubleday, $19.95)
</P>
<P>
   The best way to describe these stories is to say that William
Faulkner _ or Flannery O'Connor, or Carson McCullers, with her
affinity for the strange and the outcast _ would have read them and
smiled. Separately, (as they appeared in ``Esquire,'' ``The New
Yorker'' and other magazines), they are vignettes stolen from a
territory of otherworldly isolation. Published together, they take
on an air of macabre suspense, even when the mystery involves
nothing more than a hospitalized boy's Christmas wish to watch
Alfred Hitchcock's film ``The Birds,'' or a child's efforts to come
to terms with the anger of his impoverished father. This is dark
(and sometimes oddly humorous) terrain, yet Richard's characters
are good company and his style is as entertaining as it is ominous
and original. His previous books are ``Fishboy'' and ``The Ice at
the Bottom of the World,'' and he now writes for television's
``Party of Five.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; WORK IN PROGRESS &QL; 
 &UR; Michael Eisner (Random House, $27.95)
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Michael Eisner was at a conference in Idaho with
the likes of Bill Gates, Warren Buffett and Tom Brokaw when he felt
pain in his arms and chest. When he got home, he drove from the
airport to a hospital, where he underwent coronary bypass surgery.
As he was being wheeled into the operating room, he gave orders to
his wife, Jane. He wanted to be buried above ground, not below. He
didn't want her to build the new house they'd been considering.
``And,'' he added, ``if it becomes an issue, I think that either
(Michael) Ovitz or (Barry) Diller would be good choices to succeed
me.'' Eisner, chief executive of the Walt Disney Co., had shifted
into his executive mode, he admits, even ``using the leverage of my
imminent surgery to win deathbed agreements from my wife.'' This
memoir is long (430 pages) and pictureless, but it's an interesting
look at Eisner's management style and at the drive and creativity
required to run Disney. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE BIBLE &QL; 
 &UR; Kenneth C. Davis (Morrow, $25)
</P>
<P>
   The Bible, Davis writes, ``is hard to understand. It's
confusing. It's contradictory. It's boring. In other words, the
Bible perfectly fits Mark Twain's definition of a classic: `a book
which people praise and don't read.' '' Davis thought he had a
working knowledge of the Bible until he researched his previous
book, ``Don't Know Much About Geography,'' and posed a few
questions: Where was the Garden of Eden? What is the world's oldest
city? Did Moses really cross the Red Sea? In answering the last, he
found that Moses and the tribes of Israel never crossed the Red
Sea, but escaped across the Sea of Reeds, which might be one of
several Egyptian lakes or a marshy section of the Nile Delta. In
other words, if he'd been interested in authenticity, C.B. DeMille
would have sent Charlton Heston out across a soggy bog. Among the
questions Davis answers here: What's a ``testament''? Where did
Cain's wife come from? Did Delilah snip more than just hair? Who
really killed Goliath? What happened to Jonah's whale? Davis' other
books are ``Don't Know Much About History'' and ``Don't Know Much
About the Civil War.'' &QL;

   If you've dropped this newspaper and are sprinting to your
doctor's office, Weingarten thinks there's still hope for you. If
you're reading this  &UR; in &LR;  your doctor's office, the outlook for
recovery is grim. There is, in fact, only one known cure for
hypochondria: You must contract a life-threatening disease. That's
what Weingarten did in 1991 (we won't spoil the end of his book by
saying more), and his hypochondria disappeared, perhaps because
suddenly he had other things to think about. He may be writing from
memory, but he's no slouch _ this is a funny book, with chapters
such as ``Hiccups Can Mean Cancer,'' ``How Your Doctor Can Kill
You'' and ``Things That Can Take Out An Eye.'' A writer for the
``Washington Post,'' he invites comparison with Dave Barry, who
contributed an introduction. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   And here, for you who sit jittery in your doctors' offices, is a
hypochondriac's dream. The Sharps have assembled more than 500
pages of what they consider to be the 1,300 best health-care Web
sites available on the Internet today. They are separated into
categories, so it's easier to find sites devoted to children's
care, mental health, sexuality and fertility, aging and long-term
care, insurance and managed care, plastic surgery, dental care,
diseases and conditions, and many other subjects. Each listing
includes a picture of the Web page and a very brief description _
the authors obviously assume you would rather find the details on
your computer. The book includes a CD with links to all the sites. &QL;

DESPITE ITS IRISH CLICHES, `TRINITY' HAS PROMISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ There's the Irish cop and the Irish priest and
the Irish union mobster and the Irish substance abuser. The bar
they all hang out at is called ``Murphy's.'' The family is the size
of a small town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trinity'' has more cliches than a Harlequin romance novel. The
funny thing about cliches and stereotypes is, they are sometimes
true.
</P>
<P>
   And among the myriad shows riddled with stereotypes, there are
good ones like ``Trinity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I met about 20 Irish cops and their fathers were cops and
their uncles were cops,'' said Justin Louis, who plays Detective
Bobby McCallister of the NYPD and Clan McCallister. ``I don't see
the stereotypes.''
</P>
<P>
   Trust us, Justin, they are there. But luckily, the acting and
directing rise above these stereotypes, making ``Trinity'' a
compelling one-hour drama.
</P>
<P>
   NBC is banking heavily on ``Trinity,'' a show from executive
producer John Wells (``ER,'' ``China Beach''), especially since it
is sandwiched between ratings favorite ``Dateline'' and the
critically acclaimed ``Homicide: Life on the Street.'' If you have
seen 30 seconds or more of any NBC show or ballgame in the past few
weeks, odds are you've caught a ``Trinity'' commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Based in New York City's Hells Kitchen, ``Trinity'' (premiering
Friday at 9 p.m. Eastern, check local listings ) focuses on the
individual lives of a diverse McCallister family who still gather
every Sunday at mom and dad's for dinner. The makers promise the
same character twists seen on ``ER,'' where stable characters can
make dumb choices and the miscreants can turn out to be the wise
ones.
</P>
<P>
   This is a great season to be Irish on television. In addition to
``Trinity,'' several other shows built around Irish-American
families will be featured, most notably the one-hour ``To Have &AMP; To
Hold'' on CBS and the sitcom ``Costello'' (yes, it's Irish) on Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, CBS will present the mid-season ``Turks,'' the
story of an Irish cop family starring William Devane, who based his
character in part on a relative who served in the Albany Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   What these shows, especially the dramas, have in common besides
ethnicity is a focus on the family rather than the workplace. Wells
said the dynamics of a family especially an Irish-American family
can provide as much drama as, say, a fictional Chicago emergency
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irish families, because of the influence of the church, and a
history and a heritage which requires that you remain close to your
family, is a good place to sort of examine that tension,'' the
producer said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Louis, Tate Donovan (last seen in a recurring
role on ``Friends'') stars as the Rev. Kevin McCallister. Both
Donovan and Wells said they don't expect the role to create the
same maelstrom that surrounded the fine but doomed ABC priest show
of last season, ``Nothing Sacred.'' But in the first episode Father
McCallister is presented with a pair of ethical/religious dilemmas
that may make some conservative Catholics queasy.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Clayburgh (``An Unmarried Woman'' and many other films) is
a late addition to the ensemble cast as matriarch Eileen
McCallister.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show is essentially the family, about how five individual
people living their own lives somehow connect by blood,'' Louis
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trinity,'' if true to its initial promise, should connect with
viewers. And they won't even have to be Irish.

   CANCER-INSURANCE (Seattle) Teri Lafnitzegger, a 37-year-old
mother of two, was recently diagnosed with a brain tumor and told
by her Group Health doctor that her only chance was a unique
neurosurgical procedure offered by Duke University. She was
referred by her doctor and supposed to get the $100,000 surgery
this week, when Group Health at the last minute refused to cover it
as ``experimental.'' Her doctors at Duke say Group Health is
technically right, but wrong to deny coverage. Most insurers are
paying for this, they say, because it's the only chance for such
tumors. Some patients given months to live have survived for years.
``The clock is ticking on this woman,'' said Dr. Henry Friedman of
Duke. ``What's the problem with this insurance company?'' The Duke
procedure has good data and may be saving lives. PHOTO.

WOMAN DENIED BEST HOPE FOR TUMOR BY INSURANCE CO. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (Photo available through Wieck Photo Database)  
 By TOM PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A Kitsap County, Wash., woman suffering from a
fast-growing and highly lethal brain tumor has been denied
insurance coverage for a procedure she believes offers her the only
chance of survival.
</P>
<P>
   Teri Lafnitzegger, a 37-year-old wife and mother of two in
Olalla, wants Group Health Cooperative to pay for a unique
neurosurgical procedure available only at Duke University Medical
Center in Durham, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Lafnitzegger has glioblastoma, an almost invariably fatal brain
tumor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said I have nine months,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clock is ticking on this woman,'' said Dr. Henry Friedman,
a surgeon at Duke who performs the procedure involving radioactive
antibodies. Surgery for Lafnitzegger had been scheduled for
yesterday, but the operation was canceled when Group Health
officials said they would not pay the $100,000 cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drug they use is not FDA-approved . . . and there's not
much published literature on this,'' said Dr. Hugh Straley, an
administrator and oncologist at Group Health in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman truly believes he has the best approach to treating
glioblastomas, Straley said, but the opinion of one doctor or even
one medical center isn't proof enough. Lafnitzegger can appeal the
decision, he said, and because of the medical urgency that appeal
will be expedited.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do it in a matter of days,'' Straley said.
</P>
<P>
   The broader question, he said, has to do with who should pay for
unproven therapies.
</P>
<P>
   For Lafnitzegger, the answer is simple. ``It's the only chance I
have,'' she said. ``Even if all they can do is help me live another
year, that's reason enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Lafnitzegger, who with her husband, Eric, has two boys, ages 4
and 6, has perhaps the most aggressive and deadliest of brain
tumors, known as glioblastoma multiforme. She's had brain surgery
to remove some of the tumor and external beam radiation therapy,
but the cancer persists.
</P>
<P>
   When it appeared that there was little more to be done for her
at Group Health, she and her doctor began exploring the unique
neurosurgical procedure at Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Lafnitzegger said her physician at Group Health Cooperative in
Tacoma ordered the tests required by Duke's Comprehensive Cancer
Center and her oncologist agreed to refer her.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they had to cancel the surgery because Group Health
was refusing to pay,'' Lafnitzegger said. She was stunned, scared
and angry. The cooperative called Duke to cancel the surgery but
didn't call her, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Straley said Lafnitzegger was not referred to Duke. Her
physician only agreed to explore this option, Straley said, which
was somehow misconstrued by Duke as a referral and authorization
for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of many investigational therapies,'' he said. It
would be irresponsible for Group Health to authorize coverage for
an unproven treatment based on one patient's or one doctor's
assessment, he said. Straley said standard procedure calls for
chemotherapy following surgery and radiation therapy.
</P>
<P>
   But he admits that survival rates for patients who receive
standard care is terrible. ``Most patients die of this in 18
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman said Group Health's refusal is a knee-jerk response
insurers use when asked to pay for any new therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer they stall, the more likely it is she won't be a
candidate,'' he said. ``The clock favors the insurance company. . .
. She may not have weeks . . . They know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman thinks he can give Lafnitzegger more time, perhaps a
lot more.
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina cancer specialists employ a new twist on a
standard approach to treating this form of brain tumor using
radioactive antibodies to target and kill cancer cells. It's
investigational, Friedman acknowledged, but patients are already
surviving much longer than expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our patients appear to be beating the odds,'' Friedman said.
One of his first patients was given a year to live _ nearly five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be five years on Dec. 9,'' said Susan Feinglos,
director of the medical library at Duke. She had a relatively large
tumor in her right frontal lobe and was told by her physician
husband not to read the medical literature on glioblastoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one lived,'' Feinglos said. ``It was pretty gloomy.''
</P>
<P>
   She won't claim to be cured, but Feinglos has so far shown no
signs of recurrent cancer. Not all of the patients at Duke do so
well. Many die anyway, but Friedman contended it's worth the
estimated $100,000 even if all they can do is give someone like
Lafnitzegger a year or two longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see my youngest son enter kindergarten,''
Lafnitzegger said.
</P>
<P>
   The Duke therapy is an improvement on standard therapy, Friedman
said, but he contended it doesn't increase the cost of treating
glioblastoma because they don't charge for the experimental
antibody.
</P>
<P>
   In the procedure, surgeons go in and remove as much of the tumor
as possible. Into the surgically created ``crater'' in the brain,
doctors place a tube. After the crater is tested for leaks using
tracer isotopes, a chamber containing a cancer-killing liquid
iodine solution is connected to the tube.
</P>
<P>
   The liquid contains monoclonal antibodies that have been
manufactured to target specific tumor proteins and that carry
radioactive iodine-131.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use liquid iodine because we figured we'd get a more
homogeneous distribution and less radiation damage to healthy
tissue,'' Friedman said.
</P>
<P>
   In a study published last June in the Journal of Clinical
Oncology, the Duke team, led by Dr. Darell Bigner, reported on the
increased survival time among patients with glioblastoma treated in
this fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman, who works with Bigner, noted that many private
insurers helped pay for the patients in that study. As examples, he
cited Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, Aetna, Prudential, Cigna,
Travelers and even state Medicaid programs in New York and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a disease is terminal and the patient has no other choice,
many insurers cover it,'' Friedman said.

BUGGED BY YOUR MUG? LET'S TALK ABOUT IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JON HAHN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Whenever a clerk asks to see my driver's license, I
say: ``OK, but only if you promise (begin italics) not (end
italics) to laugh at the picture!''
</P>
<P>
   This of course predisposes them to do just that. Some start
giggling even before I reach into my wallet for the license. Or,
they smile when they see the typical police lineup photo. And they
condescendingly say something like: ``Oh, (begin italics) that's
(end italics) not so bad!''
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes they even volunteer: ``You oughta see mine!'' Of
course, very few ever reach into their own wallet or purse to
display their own version of what the Department of Licensing
thinks is a reasonable likeness.
</P>
<P>
   We are, to a person, locked inside our own person. Despite all
the wonders of plastic or corrective surgery, collagen injections,
miracle creams, dietary supplements, artificial tanning and
expensive cosmetics, we are the same guy or gal we came in with.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, we're the spitting image of our parents. I'm not,
which has from the start occasioned whispered conversations about
what our mother might've been doing while my father was out on the
road as a traveling salesman . . . a quirky twist on a standard
joke format.
</P>
<P>
   Neither do I look anything like my twin sister _ something for
which she should be eternally grateful. In fact, although she has
hair on top of her head, neither of us looks anything like our two
older siblings. But the whispers have died down by now and there's
no sense going there.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us, for a variety of mostly vain reasons, affect the
Very Northwest hirsute countenance. And as the ``Wanted'' photo at
the top of this column vividly shows, a beard and/or mustache
cannot truly hide nor much enhance what our genes set in place.
</P>
<P>
   I have, on occasion, come clean by clearcutting the beard and
mustache. And on some of those occasions, the editors bothered to
have the column photo reshot. My late mother, never one to mince
words, saw one of those clean-shaven column photos and told me in
our next telephone conversation: ``You know, you never were a very
handsome guy. I think you should grow it all back.''
</P>
<P>
   She should've lived long enough to read the latest news release
about a University of Louisville plastic surgery researcher who
predicts that complete face transplants might be possible within a
few months.
</P>
<P>
   That gives a whole new meaning, a really scary context to the
driver's license section that declares ``organ donor.'' You don't
get to see someone's liver or kidneys or heart or whatever part you
might be hoping for _ and that's just as well, perhaps. But with
the possibility of complete facial transplants, what you see on the
driver's license photo is what you get.
</P>
<P>
   And let's face it . . . do you know (begin italics) anyone (end
italics) whose countenance you might want, based on their driver's
license photo?
</P>
<P>
   If you've seen the movie ``Face/Off,'' you knew it was already
possible. I'm not sure what their mothers would've thought, but
then, Nicolas Cage and John Travolta already had their faces
merchandised into millions. And as we movie viewers get older, it's
comforting to see Travolta's face, in particular, become rounder .
. . just like our own.
</P>
<P>
   And Cage's nose seems larger . . . just as my own.
</P>
<P>
   This is the time of year everyone toys with the idea of renting
or buying a particularly eye-catching (so-to-speak) Halloween mask.
I haven't taken the time to research whether there are any Bill
Clinton ``What, Me Worry?'' masks. Or any Monica Whatzername masks.
And if I were going out to a Halloween party in a Ken Starr mask, I
think I'd wear a Kevlar vest under my cloak and let someone else
start my car.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is to belittle the legitimate and downright
wonderful facial reconstruction surgeries done for accident, birth
defect or disease victims. But I think we make too much out of how
we look. We are too quick to assess the book by its cover, even if
it's what we see in the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   As a youngster, I used to stand in front of the bathroom mirror
and contort my face into grotesque masks. And that same mother used
to warn: ``If you keep doing that, someday it's going to stay that
way!''
</P>
<P>
   Don't you just hate it when it turns out they were right?

REGULAR TESTING SEEN AS CRUCIAL IN BATTLE AGAINST COLON CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Most Americans are unaware that colorectal
cancers are the second leading cause of cancer death and will kill
an estimated 56,500 people this year.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Katie Couric, the co-anchor of the ``Today'' show,
lost her husband, NBC legal commentator Jay Monahan, to colon
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors are optimistic that Darryl Strawberry, the Yankee
outfielder, will recover from the disease after surgeons removed a
cancerous tumor from his colon earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they catch it early enough, they can do something about
it,'' said Richard Cartwright of Chatham, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright, 68, considers himself fortunate. A decade ago, he
got a fecal occult blood test, recommended for everyone over 50 on
an annual basis. That test detected something amiss and prompted
doctors to look closer at Cartwright's colon.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did indeed find a polyp that had cancer cells on it but
had not spread,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After surgery to remove the problem polyp, Cartwright has been
careful about getting screened on a regular basis, especially
because his father also had a history of colon problems.
</P>
<P>
   While physicians recommend that healthy patients with no family
history of colon cancer get a flexible sigmoidoscopy every five
years and a colonoscopy every 10 years, Cartwright has been
following a more rigorous screening schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Every two years, he gets a colonoscopy, a procedure that allows
doctors to examine the inside of the colon with a long, flexible
fiber optic instrument.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Cartwright's vigilance paid off when doctors
found a larger tumor. Though it turned out not to be cancerous,
Cartwright had to have an operation to remove part of his large
intestine.
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright has since been able to return to work as a strategic
planner. Today, he feels fine and reminds all of his friends and
relatives to get checked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the least-publicized cancers,'' he said. ``People
don't like talking about that part of their anatomy.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows what causes colon cancer and there are no clear,
early warning signs.
</P>
<P>
   That underscores why regular screening is so important for men
and women age 50 and older and in younger people with a family
history of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe there may be some genetic predisposition to
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   But most colon cancers can't be linked to genes. Instead,
researchers believe our country's high-fat, low-fiber diet is to
blame.
</P>
<P>
   The American Cancer Society recommends that people who want to
lower their risk of colon cancer eat more vegetables, fruits and
grains, and limit their consumption of fats and red meat.
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright is doing just that. ``Butter is off the table,'' he
said. He is also taking other steps to improve his overall health.
A decade ago, about the time he was first diagnosed with a colon
problem, he quit smoking, breaking a 40-year addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he's developed another habit to stay ahead of colon
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still get screened every couple of years,'' he said. ``I
plan to keep doing it as long as I'm on the planet.''

   CLINTON-EDUCATION (Washington) _ As budget bargaining
intensifies between the White House and Congress, President Clinton
visits an overcrowded public school with students in classroom

exists between higher-income students who have computers at home
and lower-income students who don't. By DAN FREEDMAN.

   MIDEAST-PEACE _ JERUSALEM _ At best, the summit between Israeli
and Palestinian leaders starting tomorrow in Maryland, will just be
one step on the long road toward bringing hope to disheartened
Israelis and Palestinians. But, it would be a necessary step before
bigger issues than the land in question can be resolved and a
crisis brewing for next May can be avoided. If the requisite
trappings of summits do materialize _ agreements signed, handshakes
photographed you can expect right wing Israelis to try to topple
the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and hard-line
Palestinians to try to block progress with terrorist actions.
Having been burned so many times when hoped seemed just around the
corner, people on both sides won't believe peace progress until
they see it. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

   US-KOSOVO _ WASHINGTON _ (DEVELOPING) An 11th-hour deal the
United States brokered with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
to avert near-term NATO air strikes and stop the bloodshed in
Kosovo has also put the Serbian province on track for talks leading
to autonomy. The breakthrough, announced Monday night by President
Clinton, came after NATO authorized airstrikes if Milosevic didn't
match his promises with action. Clinton said NATO had agreed to
hold off on airstrikes for four days so international inspectors
could verify that Milosevic has met U.N. Security Council demands
to stop the violence. But U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke said, ``We
hope this will mark a turning point in the right direction. But the
proof ... is in compliance with U.N. resolution 1199 and with
actions on the ground in Kosovo.'' (Deans, Cox News Service).

   CLINTON-POLITICS _ ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ How is the

Etheridge's district, his Republican opponent ran ads accusing him
of having ``Clinton values,'' but recently has been focusing on
more traditional issues. That seems to reflect a national trend in

   CLINTON-VICTORY _ WASHINGTON _ Some analysts argue that any
Republican gain is a mandate for impeachment, while others say that
if House Democrats do better than lose 29 seats _ the average this

censure negotiations are likely. What result would be seen as a
victory for President Clinton? (Shepard, Cox News Service).

   CLINTON-JONES _ WASHINGTON _ Come Monday, will scandal
aficionados be using the Internet to examine thousands of pages of
potentially embarrassing transcripts from Paula Jones's sexual
harassment lawsuit against President Clinton? The federal judge in
the Arkansas case plans to start releasing evidence that day in the
case, which has been dismissed but is under appeal. Many observers
bet that a settlement will be reached by then, because both sides
have strong incentives to do so. (Malone, Cox News Service).

   CHILD-ABUSE-REPORT _ A district judge was so emotionally moved
by the child abuse death of an infant last year that he has spent
months working on a special report that presents in painful detail
all the problems with Texas' child protective services system.
Judge Scott McCown took it upon himself to become a one-member
blue-ribbon taskforce to try to help abused and neglected children
in Texas. His unprecedented report _ to be sent to the Governor and
Legislature today _ shows a system spinning out of control and show
how Texas is at the bottom of the barrel compared to other states
in helping abused and neglected children and finding adoptive
parents. (Gamino, Austin American-Statesman).

   ABUSE-JUDGE _ Scott McCown once was headed for partner in one of
the country's most prestigious law firms. Then, he gave it all up
for public service. He has made his mark in Texas by working as an
assistant AG on the prison reform lawsuit and the mental
retardation institution lawsuit. Then, he became a judge and forced
Texas to adopt a more equitble funding formula for public schools.
But his heart is with the children. His most important issue these
days is child abuse and neglect and he is leaving his trademark
handprint on another major Texas issue. (Gamino, Austin
American-Statesman).

HONG KONG'S LAST BRITISH GOVERNOR DESCRIBES CHINA'S TAKEOVER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST AND WEST &QC; 
China, Power, and the Future of Asia &QC; 
By Christopher Patten &QC; 
Times Books, 304 pp., $25 &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In the language of ``East and West,'' Christopher Patten's
attempt to defend his and his country's handling of their last
years as rulers of Hong Kong, part of the colony was granted to
Britain and the remainder was leased.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reference in this book by Hong Kong's last British
governor to the vast quantities of opium that his country's traders
pushed on the 19th-century Chinese with London's blessing, no
mention that the British started wars after which the outmatched
Chinese coughed up the grants and leases for Hong Kong Island, the
Kowloon Peninsula, and the New Territories at the point of a
cannon.
</P>
<P>
   This imperialist history may be well known to diplomats,
scholars, journalists, and a few hundred million Chinese, but
omission of even a concise summary of it from the book deprives
Western readers, particularly young and ahistorical ones, of
essential background for evaluating Patten's argument that Great
Britain has been a benevolent influence in the region and China has
not.
</P>
<P>
   Britain bullied its way into possession of Hong Kong in the
mid-19th century for the noble purposes of selling drugs and
feeding on a decaying Chinese state. For well over a century, it
took no substantive step toward having Hong Kong Chinese
participate in governing themselves. Instead, it pushed another
opiate: the idea that Hong Kong people were interested in business,
not politics.
</P>
<P>
   Readers not schooled in the basic facts still will detect
Patten's bias swiftly. His Brits and their Chinese allies are
almost unfailingly wise, steadfast, hard-working, honorable; his
mainland Chinese are hysterical, noisy, strident, uncooperative.
British negotiators are ``skilled'' or, sometimes, ``affable and
polished.'' Their Chinese counterparts are ``mulish,'' sometimes
with ``a sloppy smile and the personality of a bureaucratic ...
machine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We emancipated our empire,'' Patten writes, implying falsely
that the British had a choice in the matter, and his argument that
Hong Kong should have been treated like other territories departing
from the empire for self-government is hugely flawed. Those other
places, especially in Asia, were identifiable realms before the
British conquerors came; Hong Kong and the mainland territories on
which it depended for its ability to function were part of a great
civilization then in severe decline, now resurgent.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, ``East and West'' is worthwhile on several
counts.
</P>
<P>
   For all his biases, Patten opens fascinating windows onto the
decade-long poker game between the tired empire of the West and the
reviving empire of the East that ended with Hong Kong's reversion
to China in mid-1997. For all his defense of Britain generally, he
shows how the political expediency and wishful thinking of British
leaders in the 1980s left him with few cards to play when the game
neared its end. Patten's skillful prose makes ``East and West'' an
easy read.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most worthwhile are sections on the future of China, and
on the debate over Western values versus Asian values, a debate
that has been going on since the rise of Japan, South Korea,
Taiwan, and Hong Kong as major economies.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Patten feels ``Western'' values like democracy
and the rule of law are in fact universal desires, while
``Eastern'' values like sacrificing self for family and group are
situational and impermanent. Nevertheless, he gives the subject a
thorough, thought-provoking airing.
</P>
<P>
   And his assessment of China, though laced with not-too-funny
zingers that border on the snitty, is levelheaded. It should be
required reading for anyone who fears China could replace the
Soviet Union as an evil, expansionist empire, or replace Japan as
an economic superpower _ for China is not on course to play either
role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should now come clean. It is a grave confession,'' Patten
writes. ``I am not scared witless of the People's Republic of China
or mesmerized by China's might and majesty. I am on balance more
scared of things going wrong in China ... than of things muddling
through or going rather well.''
</P>
<P>
   He then proceeds to make a very good case against the argument
that China should be left alone because it is no threat; he cites
``the arbitrary arrests, the beatings and tortures, the mass
executions, the regional repression, the organ transplants of
criminals'' and many more well-documented abuses of human rights
there. It would be a more powerful case, however, if it came from
someone who recalled the reality of his own empire more accurately,
rather than throwing a casual cloak of benevolence over it.
</P>
<P>
   Patten argues, convincingly, that Britain's tenacious,
pugnacious efforts to democratize Hong Kong in the final moments of
colonial rule put China on its best behavior there, and that the
former colony is better off for this recent history. He ignores the
obverse, which seems equally plausible: that China put Britain on
the spot, making it impossible for the modern world's champion
imperialists to dither, delay, and remain involved when it was time
to pack their bags and go.

DON'T BE DOOMED BY A BAGUETTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every country has its superstitions. So if you don't want your
vacation to be cursed (or have the locals curse you), avoid these
practices, reported by Travel Holiday:
</P>
<P>
   _In France, putting a baguette on a restaurant table with the
flat side up is a sign of doom.
</P>
<P>
   _In Japan, the numbers 4 and 9 are unlucky. Buildings often
don't have floors labeled fourth or ninth, and residents may even
avoid the numbers in conversation. Why? Because the Japanese words
for them sound a lot like their words for ``death'' and ``pain.''
</P>
<P>
   _In Sweden, putting keys on a table is considered bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   _In Russia, shaking hands in a doorway is a no-no. So is
whistling inside a building _ that means you're about to lose
money.
</P>
<P>
   _Ah, but there are good luck practices, too. In Thailand,
sighting the occasional elephant in Bangkok traffic is a positive
sign. Even better, for a small fee you can walk under its belly.
And, the magazine says, if you're a pregnant woman who does so,
that's bonus luck!

MONET MAKES AN IMPRESSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Claude Monet has been hailed as one of the supreme landscape
painters of the 19th century. Now through Dec. 27, a monumental
exhibit of works from his later years is on view at the Boston
Museum of Fine Arts.
</P>
<P>
   This spectacular exhibition brings together the late work of the
founder of Impressionism, between 1900 and his death in 1926. Monet
produced an astonishing and innovative body of work that represents
the height of his engagement with color and light. Highlights of
the exhibit include triumphant views of his garden at Giverny, and
a startling re-creation of a water lily exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit, which is being shown only in Boston, has 80
paintings by Monet, including five monumental Water-Lily panels,
the largest more than 18 feet long. ``Monet in the 20th Century''
displays paintings collected from six countries, including 10
paintings never before exhibited.
</P>
<P>
   Adult admission for the daily showing is $15 weekdays, $17.50
weekends; audio tour admission for adults is $19 weekdays, $21.50
weekends. There are lower prices for students and senior citizens;
children 5-17 are $5 at all times. For information and to charge
tickets, call 617-542-4MFA. For general information, call
617-267-9300. The museum has 38 Monet paintings in its permanent
collection.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best ways to see the exhibit is to obtain a hotel
package that includes tickets good for admission at any time. For
information on 18 hotel packages, call the Greater Boston
Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau at 888-SEE BOSTON (733-2678).
Information is also available on special Amtrak fares.
</P>
<P>
   Among hotels offering weekend packages with two VIP tickets to
the exhibit are the Swissotel (800-621-9200) at $199, including
breakfast; and The Four Seasons Hotel, Boston (617-338-4400),
beginning at $585, which also includes town car service to the
museum, an exhibit catalog, and an in-room treat.
</P>
<P>
   Monet lovers will not want to miss the dinners offered at the
Hotel Meridien inspired by the cooking journals of Monet. The
five-course meals prepared by executive chef Mark Sapienza feature
recipes from Monet's journals, with each course expertly paired
with Champagne Veuve Clicquot (Monet's favorite) and Bouchard Pere
&AMP; Fils wines. During dinner, a Museum of Fine Arts lecturer will
provide an informal talk. The dinners will be offered Oct. 15, 22,
29, and Nov. 5 and are $95 a person with parking included. Diners
have the option to obtain tickets to the exhibit. For information,
call 617-451-1900, ext. 7120. A truly memorable evening. On Nov.
14, Monet's birthday, the hotel will present a special dinner that
benefits the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Fisheries of Boston is also offering a Monet's Table
luncheon Monday through Friday through Dec. 1. The luncheon is $45
a person and includes a ticket to the exhibit and complimentary
shuttle service to the museum. Reservations must be made three days
in advance. Call 617-424-7425. Taxes are not included with either
meal.
</P>
<P>
   Can't get enough of Monet? Then plan on heading to Montreal Jan.
28 through May 9 when the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts presents
``Monet at Giverny: Masterpieces From the Musee Marmottan.'' The
exhibit features 22 paintings produced between 1903 and 1926 at the
artist's estate at Giverny, outside Paris. The exhibit is on loan
from the Marmottan Museum in Paris, which owns the world's largest
collection of the artist's works.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the exhibit will be a collection of photographs from
Montreal's Gabor Szilasi, who has documented the changing of the
seasons in Monet's garden. The photos will be shown in a

   This year, why not celebrate Thanksgiving where it all began, in
Plymouth. Beginning Thanksgiving morning, Nov. 26, the Pilgrim
Progress offers a reenactment of the procession of the Pilgrims who
survived the first cold, desolate winter in the New World. The
procession ends at Burial Hill, where a service will be held
Pilgrim-style with prayers and hymns. At Plimoth Plantation, the
replica of the original settlement, one can enjoy a Victorian
Thanksgiving Dinner with all the trimmings known since Abraham
Lincoln made Thanksgiving a national holiday in 1863. There will be
three seatings. Also available will be a Thanksgiving Day Buffet
and an all-day Courtyard Celebration. For reservations, call
508-746-1622, ext. 366.
</P>
<P>
   For a taste of Thanksgiving tradition 200 years after the
Pilgrims, Old Sturbridge Village in Sturbridge is the place to
visit. Here in the 1830s village, visitors can see families
preparing the feast on the hearth. A traditional Thanksgiving feast
will be served in the Bullard Tavern at the village. For
reservations, call 508-347-3362, ext. 325.

   The days of swashbuckling pirates on the open seas may be long

festival, a bit of the past comes to life. Pirates Week kicks off
Oct. 24 with a theme ``Chapter 22: Pages of Our History.'' Despite
the week's title, the real focus of Pirates Week is to celebrate
the Caymans' unique seafaring heritage and variety of natural and
sporting attractions. For information on events, call the Cayman

   The Florida Keys are returning to business following the recent
visit of Hurricane Georges. Reports from the area indicate all
tourism facilities in Key Largo and Islamorada are open and that
the Keys Overseas Highway, with 42 bridges over water, is open from
Miami to Key West. The Dolphin Research Center on Grassy Key
suffered some damage, but the facility's 18 dolphins were unharmed,
and the center reopened Oct. 2. Key West officially began welcoming
visitors back last Friday with air and cruise-ship visits back
again. Fantasy Fest, Key West's annual masking soiree, is still on
schedule for Oct. 23 through Nov. 1. ``By the time Fantasy Fest
gets here, this town will be really ready to party,'' said festival
director Linda O'Brien.

GROVE PARK INN BOASTS A RELAXING HISTORY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CAROL RUST 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHEVILLE, N.C. _ Sitting in a rocking chair at the back of the
Grove Park Inn is like lolling in the generous lap of a mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Sundown on the Smoky Mountains, where a steel-blue sky is sliced
with bright-orange waves, is the highlight of every day here at the
appropriately named Sunset Terrace, where rocking chairs are
thoughtfully provided to watch the rhapsodic sunsets.
</P>
<P>
   Inn employees know they aren't personally responsible for the
daily sun finale, but they act like they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little worried about it earlier in the day, but we
didn't do too badly,'' said one cocktail waitress, lingering with a
customer after she delivered a drink to the terrace.
</P>
<P>
   Step inside from the Sunset Terrace and into the Great Lodge,
where firelight plays on the mammoth granite stones that line the
yawning fireplaces and a pianist fills the room with tunes that
waft outside and down the mountain along the wind.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Lodge is the heart of the Grove Park Inn, built in
1913 as the ultimate resort lodge. Literally carved out of the
mountains, some of the boulders that make up its walls were put in
place with the moss and lichens that were growing on them when the
stone was quarried.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-story inn has grown considerably over the years. With two
modern wings, it now has 510 rooms and includes an 18-hole
championship golf course, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, a
comprehensive sports facility, three restaurants, a nightclub, two
ballrooms and 50,000 square feet of meeting space. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The Grove Park Inn's guest list reads like a ``Who's Who in
America.'' It is unofficially rumored that Zelda Fitzgerald went
off the wagon at the bar in this very hall; the sanctioned version
has her going off the wagon elsewhere and recuperating here. Or
recuperating elsewhere in Asheville while her husband, F. Scott
Fitzgerald, a giant in Jazz Age literature, stayed here.
</P>
<P>
   Scott visited the city frequently during the 1930s and always
stayed in Room 441. He liked the room because it overlooked the
courtyard and he preferred observing people to mountains. This year
the hotel restored the room to look as it did during his visits,
outfitting it with a vintage telephone and radio and Fitzgerald
memorabilia. The room can be viewed when unoccupied, or you can
stay there for $185 for two during the week, $195 on weekends. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Other famous guests to the Grove Park Inn include eight U.S.
presidents, Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, royalty, movie stars, oil
tycoons _ you name it.
</P>
<P>
   And the guest picture just wouldn't be complete without a ghost.
In Grove Park Inn's case, the Pink Lady roams about, the spirit of
a young woman who jumped to her death from an inner balcony in the
Palm Court atrium around 1920, and wanders the labyrinthine halls
of the sprawling retreat when she pleases.
</P>
<P>
   After years of denying the existence of a ghost, hotel
management finally hired a scientific team in 1996 that specializes
in paranormal occurrences. Step aside, Ghostbusters, these guys
witnessed and photographed sufficient encounters with the Pink Lady
_ all weirdly pleasant _ to fill a movie sequel, not to mention the
first chapter of ``Haunted Asheville'' (Shadowbox Publications,
$14.95). Management, realizing there was no muzzling the Pink Lady,
now touts her as part of its unique panorama of experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Guests checking in will be handed a map of the hotel, and they
would be well advised to hang onto it. Not only is it useful to
find your room in the massive building, but it also serves as a
self-guided history tour.
</P>
<P>
   The halls and courts are set up like a museum, containing
historical tidbits about the guests who've stayed there, a history
of the hotel's construction and remodeling juxtaposed against
clothing, fashions, household items and popular-selling tonics and
foods of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Grove Park Inn received the American Automobile
Association's prestigious Four Diamond Award for the sixth
consecutive year in 1998 and is listed as a four-star establishment
by Mobile Travel Guide's ``American's Best Hotels and
Restaurants.''
</P>
<P>
   Rates per night through Dec. 31 are $115 to $125 for value rooms
with limited view and one bed in the historic main inn; $185-$195
for standard rooms; and $205 to $215 for deluxe rooms with views of
either the golf course, mountains or city. Club floor
accommodations cost $325 to $335. Suites start at $525. Special
packages are available.
</P>
<P>
   The Grove Park Inn is located at 290 Macon Ave. For information,
call 800-438-5800 or 800-438-0050. Or access

   The folks in Santa Claus, Ind., get a little busy around the
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   One group known as Santa's Elves will answer as many as 10,000
children's letters to St. Nicholas this year. And postmaster Sandra
Collignon expects to hand cancel more than 500,000 cards and boxes
this year with the city's special holiday postmark. (Santa Claus'
post office normally processes just 13,000 pieces of mail each
month.)
</P>
<P>
   With all that work, the city of Santa Claus is still taking the
time to celebrate the season. The ``Christmas in Santa Claus''
festival, Dec. 12-13, will focus on an old-fashioned holiday with a
toy fair, craft show and parade. Musical entertainment is planned
and visitors will have the opportunity to be photographed with
Santa.

<P>
   The term ``peanut fares'' may soon take on new meaning in the
sky.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Transportation has notified U.S. airlines of
its position that peanut-free ``buffer zones'' should be created
aboard airplanes upon advance request by passengers with medically
documented severe allergies to peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   These zones would consist, at the minimum, of the passengers'
row and the rows immediately in front and behind.
</P>
<P>
   No, this isn't a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Admit it: No offense to thousands of Americans said to be
bothered by peanuts, but your immediate reaction _ like mine _ was
to laugh, right? I can just envision an already-beleaguered flight
attendant patrolling the aisle prior to takeoff, asking, ``Is your
seat belt fastened? Your briefcase all the way beneath your seat?
All peanuts locked in your purse?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A peanut tax? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Will those passengers still requesting peanuts _ the only
``cuisine'' served on some flights these days _ pay a higher
tariff? Perhaps a peanut tax? And will there be separate seating
sections for those preferring their peanuts salted, honey-roasted
or mixed with cashews and almonds?
</P>
<P>
   But, then, I got to thinking that the DOT may be onto something
here. Modern-day computer systems are so advanced that, utilizing
sophisticated passenger profiles, these peanut-free zones can be
established _ and adjusted _ within seconds for individual flights.
</P>
<P>
   So why stop with peanuts? Welcome to Air Shattuck, where we
really organize cabin interiors.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with ``no-conversation'' buffer zones. Have you ever
plopped into a middle seat dog-tired and ready for a catnap only to
be verbally accosted by the guy on the aisle determined to
embellish every detail about his job, his car, his family or _ my
predicament on one recent flight _ his gallbladder surgery?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, we'll still encourage courtesy how-do-you-do's throughout
the aircraft. But if you intend to babble on incessantly at 35,000
feet, you'll be assigned elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also be required to let us know in advance if you plan to
use a laptop or if you intend to make more than one call on the
airphone at your seat. And for overnight flights, we'll separate
those who wish to read and those who prefer to sleep _ with an
additional distinction among the second group for snorers and
nonsnorers.
</P>
<P>
   Those who disdain cologne or perfume, or worse, deodorant _
another allergy, I presume _ will be grouped, too. Maybe with the
cargo.
</P>
<P>
   We'll require a medical certificate attesting to bladder size
and function. No stepping on innocent toes in a frantic rush aboard
Air Shattuck; passengers with weak bladders will automatically get
an aisle seat near the lavatory.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rest easy &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We'll also keep recliners and nonrecliners apart. Isn't it
amazing how, just as you release the food tray _ in the
peanuts-allowed section, that is _ the passenger in the row ahead
adjusts his seat so that his hair is in your lap? Be thankful at
least that he isn't Dennis Rodman. But we'll solve that problem.
With our passenger profile system, all reclining passengers will
sit together.
</P>
<P>
   I was going to create a ``kid zone,'' too. But Israel's El Air
Airlines beat me to it. El Air's new 15-row, 150-seat section on
some Boeing 747 jets caters specifically to families with small
children; passengers receive a kit with diapers, formula and a
pacifier, and only G-rated videos are shown on movie screens in the
zone.
</P>
<P>
   Now, shame on you for requesting X-rated movies in the
``adults-only'' sections.
</P>
<P>
   Those kiddie zones give me an idea, though. If we put enough
tiny tots together in one section of the plane, we can squeeze more
seats into those rows. That will allow us _ without affecting
revenues _ to establish separate ``wide-bodied sections.'' (Hey,
it's my airline!)
</P>
<P>
   Or with passenger profiles, maybe we'll just require an advance
listing of waist sizes _ I'm already shamed enough to begin
weight-reduction program No. 4,621 _ and make certain a stringbean
sits between every two heavyweights.
</P>
<P>
   I won't get into religious preferences. Or politics. Well, with
these exceptions: Republicans will be seated near the right wing,
Democrats beside the left wing.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and one other thing: Avid Starr backers and Clinton
supporters will all be assigned to the no-conversation zone. With
G-rated videos.
</P>
<P>
   Time to stop. I've got to purchase popcorn for folks in the
peanut-free zone.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone allergic to melted butter? &QL;

HAS PENDULUM SWUNG AGAINST GOP? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For those following politics who like their
analogies taut, to the point, and oversimplified, here are some
thoughts for the stretch drive of '98:
</P>
<P>
   This is 1996, or possibly 1990. This is not 1994. This is for
the moment a campaign in an atmosphere favoring mildly progressive
ideas whose impact is being blunted by scandal politics for which
President Clinton is ultimately responsible _ 1996 redux, if you
will.
</P>
<P>
   This is, again for the moment, NOT a campaign in which a
volcanic, landscape-altering explosion looms. This could be a
fairly typical off-year election, favoring the party not in the
White House in the congressional contests but more likely by less
than is historically typical. And in the State Houses, this could
be a an election that produces very little overall change, meaning
a continuation of the overall Republican domination (32
incumbents), though many of those Republicans govern more like Bill
Clinton than Newt Gingrich. For a metaphor, the Republicans are
superbly positioned to recapture Florida with a dramatically
moderated Jeb Bush from his '94 incarnation, while the Democrats
lead slightly in an attempted takeaway in California with a rabid
moderate, Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   But even this thumbnail sketch may miss a more fundamental
point. Unless one party gets hot nationally, 1999's major paradigm
around here is likely to be the same as this year's: whether it's
impeachment or Social Security, HMOs or public schools, one-party
governance is neither in the cards nor especially desired by the
public. For things of consequence to happen, the hands either reach
across the aisle by the dozens in the House and by 10 or so in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The two most recent, most revealing clues about the atmosphere
going into the final month come from the right. Last week, the
Republican Party began putting out its first big batch of so-called
issue commercials for use, via the outrageous soft money loophole
in election law, in campaigns around the country.
</P>
<P>
   They are warm and fuzzy ads, urging voters to pick Republicans
because they'll protect Social Security and improve education and
because they've done a great job helping to balance the budget, cut
taxes, and reform welfare. There is no Contract with America this
time, no emphasis on vouchers for private schools or huge tax cuts
and government downsizing. They are blurring distinctions far more
than they are making them this year.
</P>
<P>
   And over the weekend, the Republicans in Congress were throwing
their pet, conservative ideas over the side by the crateful in an
effort to meet the president's objections far more than halfway, in
a determined rush to get out of here and go campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for all this mush from a party more committed in
recent years to revolution than reason is simple: The always
swinging poll pendulum has swung slightly against them in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In nonpresidential years, the wisest course for the poor citizen
is to pay absolutely no attention to any national polling or
commentary about the election until the final month. This year,
however, it has been hard to ignore because of the Monica Lewinsky
affair and its complete domination of the national and even
regional media.
</P>
<P>
   This has produced two, equally overstated, swings of the
pendulum. In the spring, when the president was still denying
everything, the Democrats really thought the public reaction
against ScandalRama might give them the House of Representatives
back.
</P>
<P>
   They were wrong. The president's confession on Aug. 17 that he
had at least lied to the country about his relationship with
Lewinsky fired up hardcore Republicans everywhere and clearly
dispirited many hardcore Democrats. The talk then was of 1994, and
another House landslide combined with the dream of a
filibuster-proof, 60-vote Senate majority.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong again. It's now clear that the Republicans nationally and
here overplayed their hand by releasing the gory details of
prosecutor Kenneth Starr's impeachment referral along with the
videotape of Clinton's grand jury testimony to a largely disgusted
country.
</P>
<P>
   So the pendulum moved once again. The largely negative reaction
to the House's initial handling of impeachment has produced an
increasingly mixed view of Congress overall. From 55-36 percent
positive in mid-September by the Gallup people's measurement for
CNN and USA Today, Congress's job approval fell to 48-44 percent
negative last week.
</P>
<P>
   As for the congressional Republicans' handling of the charges
against the president, a mixed verdict in mid-September had turned
sharply negative (58-34 percent) last week and was more sharply so
than it was before Clinton's Aug. 17 confession.
</P>
<P>
   Where the talk last month was of Republican intensity, now it's
angry Democrats who appear to be stirring, while conservatives
grumble about the decision by Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott to
jettison nearly all of their legislative agenda in the closing
hours of the largely unproductive Congress.
</P>
<P>
   That national picture, though, has no lasting validity
necessarily, because it has yet to translate into specific
developments in specific campaigns around the country.
</P>
<P>
   This is going to be a weird, gyrating month, Fasten your
seatbelts remains the most useful advice.

FIGURES OF SPEECH OFTEN BLUR AS THE CULTURE MOVES ON
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Globe's volunteer proofreaders have been especially vigilant
in recent months, judging by the volume of tsk-tsk mail coming in.
Both William Lockeretz and Monica Wing noted the headline that
declared ``Unions try new tact to organize'' _ perhaps written by
someone who thought tact was short for tactic _ when the nautical
tack was the word to use. Bob Kittredge found us broaching no
opposition when we should have been brooking none, mitigating
rather than militating, and calling an ascetic guy aesthetic (not
that he couldn't have been both).
</P>
<P>
   But the complaint that caught my eye was the e-mail from Chip
Hitchcock pointing out our use of ringer for wringer. ``Wringers
were obsolete when I was a child, but I still knew what they
were,'' he said, and so should we. But we blew it againin a recent
Washington story that quoted a White House assistant who was upset
at not having been told about the Lewinsky matter. ``Now my butt's
in a ringer,'' the Globe had him saying.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever that feels like, it's probably better than having it in
a wringer, which was standard equipment on early washing machines
until the spin cycle (mechanical, not political) superseded it in
the middle of the century. A pair of spinning rollers, the wringer
squeezed out excess water before the clothes were hung out to dry
(another expression that gets more figurative than literal use
these days). Think of a pasta machine rolling out dough, and you'll
get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Figures of speech often blur as the culture moves on _ we have
no horses, so free rein becomes free reign _ but it seems too soon
for journalists to be getting wringer wrong. After all, it's
central to one of the most famous quotations in newspaper history:
Attorney General John Mitchell's declaration, in 1973, that if the
Washington Post printed a story about a secret fund controlled by
Nixon's backers, its publisher, Katharine Graham, would ``get her
tit caught in a big fat wringer.'' That was 25 years ago, but I'll
bet the Post's writers and editors still know the difference
between ringer and wringer.

 &HT;    As the evidence has mounted against President Clinton, I
believed that he would resign in shame and in the best interests of
our country. But it is now obvious that Clinton will not
voluntarily resign.
 &HT;    Impeachment proceedings will drag on for months and preoccupy
our nation to the detriment of ourselves and the world.
 &HT;    Our attention should be focused on a global economy that is
crumbling and could melt down and on a number of unstable military
situations, from Korea to India to Pakistan to Kosovo. Aside from
the alarming international scene, domestic problems such as health
care, social security and education must be solved.
 &HT;    Our nation, which has been a source of stability and good
throughout the world, cannot be leaderless at such a crucial time _
and yet we are.
 &HT;    President Gerald Ford's recommendation that Clinton be publicly
rebuked in the well of the House of Representatives is not the
answer. It would only further diminish Clinton's effectiveness at a
time when we need a strong, respected president _ not a man whose
reputation has been totally destroyed by an embarrassing public
rebuke on the House floor.
 &HT;    By now, Clinton has been reduced to attending political
fund-raisers and making endless phone calls to friends seeking
their advice on his pitiful personal crisis.
 &HT;    More than 180 newspapers have called for Clinton to resign. Many
have editorialized that his inexcusable actions in the Oval Office
threaten to seriously erode the integrity of the nation and damage
the standards, morals and ethics of our young people.
 &HT;    History teaches us that for any free society to survive and
thrive it must rest on a strong moral and ethical base. The issue
is not, ``Did he lie under oath?'' The issue is, ``Did he lie?''
And the answer is yes.
 &HT;    Clinton has taught our children to lie. Clinton has taught our
nation that a man does not have to be faithful to his wife and
family and can repeatedly devastate them by his irresponsible
actions. Clinton has taught our students in high school and college
that anything goes in their sexual behavior.
 &HT;    No wonder at least seven Boy Scouts in Utah who won Eagle awards
for observing the oath of honor and duty to God, country and self _
the highest commendation boys age 11 to 17 can earn _ refused their
certificates with Clinton's signature as honorary president of the
Boy Scouts of America.
 &HT;    Our children learn the words of our first president, George
Washington, who said, ``I cannot tell a lie.'' Two hundred years
later we have a president, Bill Clinton, who cannot tell the truth.
 &HT;    Any person who observes Clinton's behavior _ ranging from
intelligent to clever to wildly reckless and juvenile _ can only
conclude that he is emotionally unstable. And he shows a complete
inability to learn from the ill-chosen experiences of his youth,
from promiscuity to ``experimentation'' with drugs to evading the
draft.
 &HT;    Again and again, as a married adult, he has taken advantage of
women _ whether it's Gennifer Flowers, Paula Jones, Monica Lewinsky
or others whose names are not in the public record. He has earned
their disrespect and destroyed their lives. Any business executive,
high school principal or police chief who repeatedly lied and had
sex with an employee would be fired.
 &HT;    Why should we accept a lower standard from Clinton, who as
president is charged with life-and-death responsibilities?
 &HT;    Any member of the military who lies will be court-martialed,
without regard to whether he was under oath. Any military person
who is involved in sexual harassment or adultery will be
court-martialed.
 &HT;    Clinton, as commander in chief, surely must be held to these
same standards. He has the ability to order our precious sons and
daughters off to war to fight and die. Yet the motivation, wisdom
and rationality of his judgment are highly debatable in matters of
domestic and foreign policy.
 &HT;    Clinton has lied to the people he loves the most and he has
repeatedly devastated them _ his immediate family and closest
colleagues and friends _ and yet the pattern persists. He is
willing to inflict serious long-term damage on the Democratic
Party, our nation and millions of people throughout the world just
to stay in power.
 &HT;    As a young man campaigning for Congress in Arkansas in 1974,
Clinton repeatedly included references to President Richard Nixon's
predicament. ``I think it's plain that (Nixon) should resign and
spare the country the agony of this impeachment and removal
proceeding,'' Clinton said, according to the Arkansas Democrat on
Aug. 6, 1974. ``There's not any point now in (Nixon) putting the
country through an impeachment since he isn't making any pretense
of innocence now,'' Clinton said, according to the Little Rock
Gazette on Aug. 8, 1974.
 &HT;    After making these demands on Nixon, why doesn't Clinton hold
himself to the same standard of accountability and resign?
 &HT;    Clinton doesn't understand duty, honor, country or faith,
courage, service or truth _ and honor beyond all. He certainly does
not understand the Navy's ethic: ``When principle is involved, be
deaf to expediency.''
 &HT;    We cannot take the privileges and freedom we have in this great
nation for granted. We, the people, must be the guardians at the
gate.

   GIVERNY-ON-HUNTINGTON _ All right, so he was more infatuated _
even obsessed _ with water lilies than Popeye was with spinach, or
George Bush isn't with broccoli. France's Green party would run him
for president if he were around today. And if they were around,
Lily Pons of opera fame and Lillie Langtry, queen of music halls,
would sing his praises for painting the town green, enshrining
their namesakes.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't necessarily make Claude Monet weird. Even though he
celebrated water lilies as Andy Warhol did soup cans, there's a
difference. Monet had talent. Glorious talent. Tremendous talent.
His models, the lilies of the pond in his Japanese garden at
Giverny, not far from Paris, were thriving the last time I looked a
couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   They thrive today with a forever-look on their verdant flat
faces at the Huntington Avenue picture palace in Boston called the
Museum of Fine Arts. Here the bearded Frenchman's fetish for
flowering floaters is being beautifully indulged until Dec. 27 in a
show called ``Monet in the 20th Century.'' Currently, Monet's
Giverny loves are more accessible by MBTA than jet, and the price
is righter, says my friend, Author.
</P>
<P>
   As we wander the rooms glowing with his soothing colors, Author
says she isn't an impressionable person but is ``pretty impressed''
by the great impressionistic stuff this geezer (1840-1926) was
still turning out when he was around the 80 mark. He aged as well
as our local treasures, Fenway Park and Maud Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how he painted the same scene over and over, but
gave each painting new meaning,'' she says. ``As a writer, I'd find
it difficult to do that, keep describing a situation again and
again, yet make it ever fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   So fresh that you feel a couple of resident frogs will suddenly
appear in one of his scenes, croaking amorously, ``Your pad or
mine?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, he was kinky for `nympheas' _ that's water lilies in
Greek,'' says Author. ``Lucky for us. Because he was out there
painting at all times of day, in every season. He caught the
reflections of sun and sky in the pond at different hours, and each
painting we see is distinctive.''
</P>
<P>
   Remembering Giverny, I'm starting to think that Monet improved
on nature, and it didn't even set him back carfare. His walk to
work was never more than a few steps from the pink house he shared
with his wife, Alice. Probably Alice often commanded, ``Take a
hike, Claude. Get out of the house and see what you can do with the
4:45 light.''
</P>
<P>
   However, that doesn't mean he was a Johnny
One-noteworthy-subject. This isn't only a lily-nilly presentation,
as rewarding as that would be. Monet hit the road, too. His visions
of London and Venice are new to most of us and hauntingly gorgeous.
Maybe he wrecked both towns for MFA gawkers who may visit them. I
mean, how can they live up to his portrayals?
</P>
<P>
   London can't. The landmarks endure, but not the conditions. The
baleful, unhealthy fog that was synonymous with London in his time,
frequently enshrouding the city _ an eerie character in story and
song _ was Monet's pal, his ally. Gazing at his misty canvases of
Parliament and the Waterloo and Charing Cross bridges, you can
almost hear him crooning ``A Foggy Day in London Town.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Without fog, London would not be a beautiful city,'' he felt.
``Fog gives it its marvelous breadth.'' But almost took away its
breath.
</P>
<P>
   One man's pollution was another man's artistic solution.
Antipollution laws after World War II cleared up and dissolved
Monet's hazy London. But we'll always have his wonderful sunset
over the Parliament House tower in 1904. Through the gauzy fog, the
sun itself and its reflection in the Thames seem orange globes of a
barbell. Parliament will never be the same again.
</P>
<P>
   Marvelous as it is, the genuine Venice pales beside his works of
1908 _ 12. ``Venice has got hold of him,'' wife Alice said. And he
gave the city a stunning brush-off. The Palazzo Ducale is a ghost,
a mirage, and the dirty, greasy Grand Canal sparkles with pinks,
greens, mauves.
</P>
<P>
   Making its public debut is a large canvas of a weeping willow in
his garden. ``Too dark and somber,'' says a viewer. Her friend
agrees. ``Too sad. I can see why it's never been shown.''
</P>
<P>
   A woman named Ruth Stanger says it looks like something a Red
Sox fan would have painted. True enough.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, the guards will have to be alert in the next room,
wary of Sox loyalists who may survey the massive canvases of the
pond and lilies that stretch 20 feet and rise six. Poor anguished
souls. Some of them, overpowered by Monet's magic and its promise
of peace, may be tempted to end it all by diving in.

   MASHED-POTATOES (Undated) _ Comfort food _ that buzz phrase
embracing all the bland, soft satisfactions of childhood eating _
doesn't quite have the cachet now that it did a few years ago, when
restaurants everywhere were trying to outdo each other in the
evocation of home and hearth. But somehow, one of those
quintessentially comforting foods, mashed potatoes, has not only
held on in popularity but also managed to ease right into the
turbulent mainstream of today's creative cookery. By Florence
Fabricant.

<P>
   EATZI-MARKET (New York) _ It's not a restaurant. It's not a
grocery store. It's Eatzi's Market and Bakery, the food store that
ate Dallas. Now, in the boldest out-of-town incursion since George
Steinbrenner bought the Yankees, it has planted its cowboy boots
right in Macy's basement. As stunned shoppers in Dallas, Houston
and Atlanta already know, Eatzi's means high-energy and high-volume
(in both senses of the word). It's a prepared-food store in which
dozens of chefs, working in open kitchens, turn out hundreds of
dishes every day, with Puccini arias blasting away in the
background. By William Grimes.
</P>
<P>
   SEASONAL-FOOD (New York) _ It's autumn in New York. A chill is
nudging through the last trace of summer's warmth, and the leaves
hint of turning. The signs are impossible to miss _ except, maybe,
if you're a chef. After all the lip service New York's best cooks
have given to the virtues of seasonal cooking, some of them have
decided that they'll cook seasonally, all right, but they'll be the
ones to choose exactly which season. By Amanda Hesser.
</P>
<P>
   MASTIC-ICE-CREAM (New York) _ Of the eight Greek dessert choices
on the menu at Molyvos, the one ordered least is mastic ice cream
with Commandaria and fig sauce. Mastic ice cream? True, the dessert
suffers from a name-image problem: it's not exactly loaded with
lyricism. It's unfamiliar, too, except to those who know this rare
and costly flavoring; at $60 to more than $100 a pound, mastic
might be called the caviar of flavors. By Suzanne Hamlin.

CREDIT INDUSTRY HAS FRIENDS IN HIGH PLACES 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT WINOKUR  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Plastic, fantastic as it is, is a major American
addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer bankruptcy filings are up 66 percent in the last five
years, to 1.35 million annually, according to the American
Bankruptcy Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Could blame lie with the sweet-talking guys at MBNA and
Providian and everyone else pushing easy credit? Could it have to
do with the fact that credit-card solicitations totaled 3 billion
last year?
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren thinks so. So do
San Francisco-area bankruptcy lawyers Norma Hammes and Irving
Kornfield, and their colleague, David Ebert of Fort Worth, Texas,
whose grade-school daughters have received applications in the
mail. All four hold the credit avalanche responsible for the
bankruptcy explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the mid-'80s consumer debt became vastly more profitable
than any other kind of lending activity because state usury laws
were effectively overturned,'' Warren said. ``Today, credit card
lending is twice as profitable as all other lending activity, even
when you account for costs and losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the mid-'80s consumer debt also just took off _ and guess
what? Bankruptcies went right through the roof behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren and the bankruptcy lawyers also are aghast that Congress
_ after being lobbied hard and lavishly by the credit industry _ is
likely to approve sweeping bankruptcy reform legislation that would
make it much more difficult for families who get in over their
heads to wipe the slate clean while protecting critical assets.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative action could force people to repay up to 30
percent of their credit card debts. Estimated savings to the
industry: more than $4 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is special-interest legislation, period,'' Warren said.
</P>
<P>
   Ebert called the legislation efforts by creditors ``to empower
the government to collect debts owed to them.''
</P>
<P>
   People like Sen. Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican, say _
correctly _ that bankruptcy should be a last resort, not a
financial planning tool. But then they cite extreme examples of
abuses under current law, such as the Virginia man who filed under
Chapter 7 but managed to keep his $640,000 race horse. This is
terribly misleading, consumer advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   Warren: ``The median income of Chapter 7 filers in 1997 was
$17,652 _ that's momma and daddy and the kid's paper route.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammes, a San Jose lawyer who heads the National Association of
Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys, said she doesn't believe the many
members of the lawmakers backing the proposed law understand the
damage it would do to hard-working people down on their luck
because of job loss or medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Kornfield, an Oakland lawyer who served as a bankruptcy trustee
in about 10,000 cases between 1969 and 1981, said the frequency of
abusive bankruptcy filings actually is low.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're losing so much money, why did Citicorp pay $3.5
billion to AT&AMP;T to buy the Universal Card?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because when you have friends in high places _ Congress,
namely _ consumer debt is a high-profit narcotic you can push
without concern for the consequences.

WHO'S THE BETTER CANDIDATE IF ECONOMY TURNS SOUR?
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With less than three weeks to go before Massachusetts
voters pick their next governor, Attorney General Scott Harshbarger
last week stood in the heart of Boston's Financial District with
the autumn sun shining on him and a cloud of economic anxiety
hovering overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon Co., the state's largest private employer, had just
announced massive layoffs on the heels of huge cutbacks at nearby
Gillette Co. The stock market was continuing its tumultuous
downward trend, the dollar was sinking, and the threat of a
worldwide recession spread by the Asian economic flu was no longer
unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   So here was Harshbarger, the gubernatorial candidate, standing
outside the old Federal Reserve Building with a dozen Democratic
business leaders who pledged their support and who said Harshbarger
is best equipped to run the state should the economy indeed sour.
</P>
<P>
   It's not an argument that's immediately convincing _ nor even
widely heard, given the tiny group of onlookers and reporters who
turned out for the event. And it's one that political analysts say
Harshbarger might not want to stress as voters come to grips with
the likelihood that the next governor will preside during a
recession.
</P>
<P>
   Do they want the Democrat, with the willpower to hold up a
safety net no matter how many people get flung from their jobs? Or
the Republican, who never saw a tax cut he didn't like?
</P>
<P>
   ``Research suggests that stock market fluctuations have no
bearing on the election,'' said Darryll West, chairman of the
political science at Brown University. ``The economy matters only
when it starts to affect people's daily lives and they start
getting laid off. And even then, there is a three- to four-month
lag effect. ... So voters will look for someone who is both
reassuring and seen as competent on economic matters.''
</P>
<P>
   West said that benefits Acting Governor Paul Cellucci, not just
because he's a Republican, but because he's the incumbent. ``When
things are in turmoil, people don't want to rock the boat,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston Globe poll taken last week shows voters are split along
party lines when asked if it is better to have a Democrat or
Republican governor in office when the legislative majority is
Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   But among independent voters _ who could be key to deciding this
election _ 37 percent favored a Republican governor, while just 19
percent of the 400 likely voters surveyed chose a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, when asked ``If the economy were to go into a
recession, who do you think would better manage bad economic
times?'' 41 percent said Cellucci, compared to 30 percent for
Harshbarger.
</P>
<P>
   Again, independents overwhelmingly sided with Cellucci on that
question, with 49 percent for him, compared to 19 percent for his
Democratic rival.
</P>
<P>
   Although Harshbarger repeatedly says Cellucci takes too much
credit for shaping the state's economy _ the attorney general says
we're riding on a national economic boom _ those polled disagree.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-four percent say Cellucci has taken about the right amount
of credit for the state of affairs and 15 percent said he is not
taking enough credit. Only 26 percent said he was taking too much
credit.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Globe/WBZ-TV poll, conducted by KRC Communications
Tuesday and Wednesday, has a margin of error of plus or minus 5
points. Of the 400 surveyed, 140 were Democrats, 177 independents
and 59 Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Harshbarger continues to plunge ahead like the running
back he was in college, trying to explain why he, and not Cellucci,
should be the steward when leadership is needed most.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger argues:
</P>
<P>
   _Cellucci wants to roll back the income tax rate to 5 percent
while the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation has said doing so
would ``be difficult to manage beyond 1999.'' Harshbarger would
gradually reduce the income tax rate, employing breaks and triggers
that allow an annual review of the budget.
</P>
<P>
   _The state has the third highest per capita debt in the nation.
Harshbarger says he would rather pay cash for capital projects when
the state can afford it. Cellucci believes vetting projects through
the bonding process keeps costs down.
</P>
<P>
   _Harshbarger says Cellucci has no plan for the economy. The
acting governor says the economy is doing well partly because of
the 28 tax breaks the Weld-Cellucci administration doled out,
including those for the burgeoning financial services and health
care sectors. Cellucci also cites opening the utility industry to
competition, reducing workers' compensation rates and lowering
unemployment insurance rates as steps he and former governor
William F. Weld have taken to encourage growth.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Cellucci says, the economy is more diversified,
relying less on the defense industry often targeted for cuts by the
federal government. It was a point he made several times last week
after Raytheon announced 14,000 layoffs, 1,200 of them in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Just days before, Gillette Co. said it was eliminating 4,000
positions, some of which may be local. Another 675 manufacturing
workers will lose their jobs at Intel's Hudson chip-making plant
over the next year, the company said last month.
</P>
<P>
   Also last week, Cellucci touted an economic report showing the
state outperforming the nation on unemployment, personal income
(growing at 5 percent a year), median household income, and
inflation, at 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cellucci, wisely, is drawing attention to those things which
have gone well,'' said Roger Porter, a political economist at
Harvard University. ``In the end, this is largely going to be a
referendum on whether or not you are satisfied with the performance
to date, and essentially it has little if anything to do with party
(affiliation).''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, there are other issues Harshbarger is pressing.
</P>
<P>
   _He criticizes Cellucci for vetoing $18 million in job-training
funding last summer, saying the move is symbolic of the acting
governor's disregard for investing in needed projects during good
times to prepare for the bad times. Cellucci defends the veto,
saying the program was unnecessary. He also was looking for ways to
fund a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   _Harshbarger, meanwhile, says he would expand adult education by
$25 million over 5 years, targeting grants for areas with the
highest unemployment rates, such as Fall River, Chelsea and Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   _And while Weld eliminated the Executive Office of Economic
Development as a separate agency to save money by reorganizing
government, Harshbarger would bring back the secretariat.
</P>
<P>
   Seizing on such ideas, Rob Gray, Cellucci's campaign manager,
said Harshbarger ``will not be a governor who will try to enforce
fiscal discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just about partisan theories on how to get out of
a recession,'' Gray said. ``It's more about keeping the Legislature
in check. In 1991, Bill Weld and Paul Cellucci came into office and
said no, you guys have to take the medicine and make the difficult
decisions to get the economy back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   But House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran, in endorsing Harshbarger
last week despite earlier concerns the attorney general might lean
too closely to the ``loony left,'' said the Legislature deserved
the credit for healing the economy. Not the corner office.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Finneran said, having a one-party system on Beacon
Hill would not be dangerous because the Democratic party knows
better than to return to ``pursuing an unfettered entitlement
mentality'' and ``trying to be all things to all people.''

HAS PENDULUM SWUNG AGAINST GOP? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For those following politics who like their
analogies taut, to the point, and oversimplified, here are some
thoughts for the stretch drive of '98:
</P>
<P>
   This is 1996, or possibly 1990. This is not 1994. This is for
the moment a campaign in an atmosphere favoring mildly progressive
ideas whose impact is being blunted by scandal politics for which
President Clinton is ultimately responsible _ 1996 redux, if you
will.
</P>
<P>
   This is, again for the moment, NOT a campaign in which a
volcanic, landscape-altering explosion looms. This could be a
fairly typical off-year election, favoring the party not in the
White House in the congressional contests but more likely by less
than is historically typical. And in the State Houses, this could
be a an election that produces very little overall change, meaning
a continuation of the overall Republican domination (32
incumbents), though many of those Republicans govern more like Bill
Clinton than Newt Gingrich. For a metaphor, the Republicans are
superbly positioned to recapture Florida with a dramatically
moderated Jeb Bush from his '94 incarnation, while the Democrats
lead slightly in an attempted takeaway in California with a rabid
moderate, Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   But even this thumbnail sketch may miss a more fundamental
point. Unless one party gets hot nationally, 1999's major paradigm
around here is likely to be the same as this year's: whether it's
impeachment or Social Security, HMOs or public schools, one-party
governance is neither in the cards nor especially desired by the
public. For things of consequence to happen, the hands either reach
across the aisle by the dozens in the House and by 10 or so in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The two most recent, most revealing clues about the atmosphere
going into the final month come from the right. Last week, the
Republican Party began putting out its first big batch of so-called
issue commercials for use, via the outrageous soft money loophole
in election law, in campaigns around the country.
</P>
<P>
   They are warm and fuzzy ads, urging voters to pick Republicans
because they'll protect Social Security and improve education and
because they've done a great job helping to balance the budget, cut
taxes, and reform welfare. There is no Contract with America this
time, no emphasis on vouchers for private schools or huge tax cuts
and government downsizing. They are blurring distinctions far more
than they are making them this year.
</P>
<P>
   And over the weekend, the Republicans in Congress were throwing
their pet, conservative ideas over the side by the crateful in an
effort to meet the president's objections far more than halfway, in
a determined rush to get out of here and go campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for all this mush from a party more committed in
recent years to revolution than reason is simple: The always
swinging poll pendulum has swung slightly against them in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In nonpresidential years, the wisest course for the poor citizen
is to pay absolutely no attention to any national polling or
commentary about the election until the final month. This year,
however, it has been hard to ignore because of the Monica Lewinsky
affair and its complete domination of the national and even
regional media.
</P>
<P>
   This has produced two, equally overstated, swings of the
pendulum. In the spring, when the president was still denying
everything, the Democrats really thought the public reaction
against ScandalRama might give them the House of Representatives
back.
</P>
<P>
   They were wrong. The president's confession on Aug. 17 that he
had at least lied to the country about his relationship with
Lewinsky fired up hardcore Republicans everywhere and clearly
dispirited many hardcore Democrats. The talk then was of 1994, and
another House landslide combined with the dream of a
filibuster-proof, 60-vote Senate majority.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong again. It's now clear that the Republicans nationally and
here overplayed their hand by releasing the gory details of
prosecutor Kenneth Starr's impeachment referral along with the
videotape of Clinton's grand jury testimony to a largely disgusted
country.
</P>
<P>
   So the pendulum moved once again. The largely negative reaction
to the House's initial handling of impeachment has produced an
increasingly mixed view of Congress overall. From 55-36 percent
positive in mid-September by the Gallup people's measurement for
CNN and USA Today, Congress's job approval fell to 48-44 percent
negative last week.
</P>
<P>
   As for the congressional Republicans' handling of the charges
against the president, a mixed verdict in mid-September had turned
sharply negative (58-34 percent) last week and was more sharply so
than it was before Clinton's Aug. 17 confession.
</P>
<P>
   Where the talk last month was of Republican intensity, now it's
angry Democrats who appear to be stirring, while conservatives
grumble about the decision by Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott to
jettison nearly all of their legislative agenda in the closing
hours of the largely unproductive Congress.
</P>
<P>
   That national picture, though, has no lasting validity
necessarily, because it has yet to translate into specific
developments in specific campaigns around the country.
</P>
<P>
   This is going to be a weird, gyrating month, Fasten your
seatbelts remains the most useful advice.

THE MANHATTAN GIULIANI WANTS TO SHOW GOP IS CLEANER AND CHEAPER
</HEADLINE>
 YORK-BOS  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He has cut crime, slashed welfare, cleaned up Times
Square, and cracked down on the Mob, but now, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani has set out on his most improbable campaign _ convincing
heartland Republicans that New York City is their kind of town.
</P>
<P>
   For several months, Giuliani has been pushing for the next
Republican Convention to be held in Manhattan _ a location not only
unprecedented in the party's 144-year history but, to many of its
more conservative members, unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the Republican National Committee's nine-member
site-selection committee has put New York City on its short list of
five, and some say it ranks high among those finalists.
</P>
<P>
   Key to the success so far is that the city Giuliani and his
aides have been selling is not quite the Manhattan that New Yorkers
love and loathe. Instead, they plan to create a cleaner, quieter,
less costly alternative _ what deputy mayor Randy Levine calls ``a
Republican Convention Village'' _ encompassing the mile-and-a-half
stretch from Madison Square Garden to Columbus Circle and all the
watering holes, resting spots, and tourist traps in between.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates worried about traffic? Key streets will be closed off
to the outside world. Security? The nation's most famous police
force will be out in full regalia. Don't like fast, rude taxi
drivers? Shuttle buses will take people to and from the Garden,
hotels, and restaurants, 24 hours a day. Hotels and restaurants too
expensive? Some of the best hotels have agreed to drop their
nightly rates below $200, and ``200 of the finest restaurants,''
Levine said, have agreed to serve delegates dinner for $20 each.
</P>
<P>
   The site-selection committee has visited here three times.
Giuliani personally gave them a bus tour of the city, wined and
dined them at Jean-George, and supplied them with tickets to
Broadway shows.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it's working.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were plenty impressed,'' said Pat Larimer, the selection
committee's chairwoman, who lives in Wyoming. ``We noticed so many
changes _ clean, safe streets. The mayor has really turned the city
around. I don't think it's any different from any other city. You
didn't get that big-city feel.''
</P>
<P>
   The big pitch, as Giuliani's communications director, Cristyne
Lategano, spelled out, is this: ``New York City is a living,
breathing example of how Republican policies can turn around an
urban center. All of the ideals and policies the mayor has put
forth have been, by and large, Republican ideals. ... The best way
to deliver that message nationally in the year 2000 is to have the
Republican Convention here.''
</P>
<P>
   That's working, too.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Fitzpatrick, a spokesman for the Republican National
Committee, which will vote on the selection panel's recommendation
in January, echoed the sentiment: ``There's a tremendous success
story that Republicans in New York have to tell. It's a
family-friendly place now.''
</P>
<P>
   Many see another dimension to New York's big push for the
convention. They note that it would showcase not only the
Republican Party, not only New York City, but also the man who led
this transformation, the next (fill in the blank: president, vice
president, attorney general, FBI director, any of the above),
Rudolph William Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor and his aides deny such ambitions, but it is
universally suspected that Giuliani has his eye on a high-level
national slot. A local term-limit law automatically ends his
mayoralty in 2001, and Giuliani has pointedly refused to promise
that he will finish the term out. He has been very cordial lately
with George W. Bush, the party's front-running presidential
aspirant. And for a man who used to hate leaving New York for even
a night, Giuliani has taken a sudden interest in touring the
remotest reaches of the country, speaking at a dozen out-of-state
Republican fund-raisers since April _ generally to acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Republican governor, George W. Pataki, has also been
making the national rounds, and lately has made no secret of his
ultimate goal, telling the New York Observer, in an interview
published last week, ``If you're governor of New York, you can't
help but think about being president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Giuliani and Pataki both suffer from the fact that they
flunk most of the modern Republican Party's social policy litmus
tests. They may score well on taxes, welfare, and law and order.
But they also favor abortion rights, gay rights, immigrants'
rights, gun control. For the conservative core that generally
chooses the Republican presidential nominee, that puts them beyond
the pale.
</P>
<P>
   Holding the convention in New York would certainly brighten the
spotlight on the mayor and the governor. ``The question,'' said one
Republican consultant, ``is whether the party wants to give a
platform to two guys who go against so much of what they hold
dear.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's New York City itself. No matter how securely the
delegates are contained in their Convention Village, the event
would certainly attract large groups of demonstrators, protesting
the party's stance on abortion, gay rights, and welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is a great city to have media attention,'' said one
local business leader with ties to the Giuliani administration, who
asked not to be identified. ``But I'd think the Republican
leadership would want the complete focus to be on the message
they're trying to deliver, as opposed to 10,000 people protesting a
few blocks away. You're guaranteed that situation in New York City.
Maybe in Indianapolis or San Antonio you're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are two of the four cities competing with New York for the
prize. The others are New Orleans and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican who is heavily involved in the campaign to bring
the convention here waved off the other cities, especially
Indianapolis and San Antonio, which he has heard are the main
threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do they get from having the convention there?'' he asked.
``They've already got those places won. To win the election, you've
got to move beyond your base. If you have the convention in New
York City, that's moving into the Democrats' heartland. If you make
New York competitive, that puts the Democrats in big trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he acknowledged, ``Certain people on the RNC staff'' are
attracted by what those cities have to offer. ``They're seen as
safe places, small towns,'' he said. ``Some Republicans like
that.''

BILL TO ISSUE MORE HIGH-TECH VISAS NEAR DEAD FOR THE YEAR
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Once considered a sure bet to become law,
legislation sought by the high-tech industry to hire more foreign
workers for US computer jobs has all but died for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was politically sensitive because President Clinton and
many other Democrats count on support both from high-tech
companies, who badly want the bill, and from labor groups, who
oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers and the White House worked out compromise legislation
last month, which the House ratified 288-133. Prospects were
considered high in the Senate, because that chamber had passed a
version of the bill earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, with the congressional session winding down, a small
group of senators blocked a vote on the bill, all but ensuring its
demise for now. Congress plans to adjourn once it passes a federal
budget, which could come as early as tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   One of the opponents, Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, said
he blocked the bill because high-tech companies had exaggerated
their difficulties in finding qualified US workers to take computer
jobs. He said many companies are laying off workers, so there was
no need to allow more foreign workers to take those jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But businesses reacted with dismay to the legislation's apparent
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this hurts the ability of American companies to
compete in the global marketplace,'' said Ken Mokler, director of
staffing at EMC Corp. of Hopkinton. ``We're looking at filling
high-level positions, enginering positions, technical-related
positions, where we need to be able to hire the best and the
brightest, and being able to hire them from anywhere is certainly a
big advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill have one more opportunity to move the
legislation, if they can persuade lawmakers to include it in a
massive budget bill that sets spending for about one-third of all
government operations for the next year. That bill is sure to be
approved, but congressional aides said chances were slight that the
foreign-worker provision would be attached to it.
</P>
<P>
   Current law allows the government to grant 65,000 so-called H-1B
visas each year for foreigners to work at skilled US jobs ranging
from software writer to nurse, physician, and fashion model. The
visas are valid for six years.
</P>
<P>
   But high-tech companies, including many around Boston, asked
Congress to raise the quota. The current allotment was filled
quickly this year, they said, because the US job market was so
tight that they could not find enough people to take computer jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions and other workers' groups opposed the new visas,
saying that employers could draw more US workers if they merely
raised wages. The labor groups also said that the alleged shortage
of high-tech workers was overstated.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation, employers would have been able to hire
115,000 skilled foreign workers in the fiscal year that began Oct.
1, and 115,000 in the following year. The cap would have dropped to
107,500 in 2001 and returned to 65,000 in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and a group of House members had negotiated
successfully to include &UR;  &LR;  several provisions that they said would
protect US workers from being replaced by foreign workers on H-1B
visas. The bill would have given the Department of Labor broader
authority to investigate companies for abuse of the visas, and it
would have set aside $75 million annually for job training and
scholarships to prepare low-income students for high-tech jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to EMC, Massachusetts companies that backed the
increase in visas included Keane Inc., a Boston software consulting
and services firm, and Cognex Inc., a Natick maker of industrial
software.

KEDS, ONCE A BLUE-CHIP BRAND, TRIES TO MAKE COMEBACK
</HEADLINE>
 RITE-KEDS-BOS  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The 1987 movie ``Dirty Dancing'' sold a lot of Keds for
the Stride Rite Corp., a company now in the midst of a turnaround.
After female lead Jennifer Grey danced slinky rhumbas while wearing
Keds, the canvas shoes became a teenage fashion statement.
</P>
<P>
   The movie ``gave us teen-age girls,'' said the company's
chairman and chief executive, Robert C. Siegel, 61, who is about to
step down and entrust Stride Rite's future to an
as-yet-unidentified successor.
</P>
<P>
   With Keds accounting for about 35 percent of annual sales for
the company, which also makes children's shoes and Sperry
Top-Siders, Lexington-based Stride Rite has been trying to hang on
to those teenage girls ever since _ but with mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, grunge was in vogue, and teens swapped their
Keds for Doc Martens. Now there are signs that Keds are cool again,
this time in pricier, reinvented styles that Keds division
president Joanna M. Jacobson debuted last spring.
</P>
<P>
   A top-of-the-line leather model with thicker soles can retail
for almost $50 , a big jump from the $18 canvas Keds most folks are
familiar with. So far, consumers are undaunted by the higher price.
For the quarter that ended Aug. 28, Keds sales were up 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
   An analyst for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Josephine R.
Esquivel, projects Keds sales of $203 million for fiscal 1998,
which ends in November.
</P>
<P>
   That's a far cry from $362 million when Keds peaked in 1992 and
accounted for 65 percent of Stride Rite's sales, but still better
than the $178 million in Keds sales last year, when most customers
were women over 25.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by a Keds comeback, Siegel thinks the company that he was
hired to turn around in 1993 is now on the right track. Still, many
Wall Street investors remain unimpressed. Stride Rite's stock price
has lost much of its value this year, hitting a 52-week low last
week of 6 5/8 on the New York Stock Exchange. Stride Rite shares
fell 1/4 yesterday to close at 7 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Stride Rite may be getting lost in the shuffle, analysts say.
``The whole footwear industry is getting beaten up,'' said Steven
A. Richter, an analyst for Tucker Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   But Steven Marotta, an analyst with Wasserstein Perella
Securities, asked: ``Does the stock price reflect Stride Rite's
future prospects? The answer is an emphatic `no.'''
</P>
<P>
   If Keds sales are up sharply, growth for Stride Rite's
well-respected brand of childen's shoes is solid, but less
dramatic. Children's shoes delivered about 35 percent of overall
Stride Rite sales last year, but this brand competes &UR;  &LR;  in a
shrinking market &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Once boys wore Stride Rite shoes almost until they were 13.
``Now we lose boys at 5 or 6,'' Siegel said. ``They want to wear
Nikes and be like Michael Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the same with girls. By age 8, many are fed up with
sensible shoes. They want fashion, shoes similar to the ones worn
by teenage sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Given the fickleness of children's tastes _ and how rapidly
young feet grow _ many parents would rather buy cheap footwear at
Wal-Mart than pay a premium for Stride Rite shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Partly to give more fashion options to young consumers and
partly to augment its ``mature'' Keds and Stride Rite brands, the
company recently signed licensing agreements to make shoes under
the brand names of such fashion-minded companies as Tommy Hilfiger,
Nine West, and Levi Strauss &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Stride Rite and Levi Strauss opted to discontinue the
Levi's shoe line after its July debut was poorly received. Results
for other licensed lines have been mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Launched in spring 1997, ``Tommy Hilfiger for Men'' got off to a
great start with many of the shoes having the same silhouette and
look as a basketball sneaker. But then sales for all basketball
sneakers, including those made by Nike, ``hit a wall'' about a year
ago, Siegel said.
</P>
<P>
   The early line on the ``Tommy Hilfiger for Women'' shoes is a
different story. The recent launch was ``spectacular,'' said
Marotta, the analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Hilfiger and Nine West also are supposed to help Stride Rite
achieve another goal _ stimulate sales all year. Keds and Top-Sider
boat shoes are spring and summer brands. And once children have
been outfitted with Stride Rite shoes at back-to-school time,
company sales go into winter hibernation.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to change that, Stride Rite recently aired the first
fall advertising campaign in recent memory. And one priority for
Siegel's successor will be to make an acquisition that rounds out
the company's brand portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   As a former president of the Dockers USA division at Levi
Strauss, Siegel thinks trouser fashions help drive shoe trends.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, people wore jeans and complemented them with
Nike sneakers and the chunkier outdoor look of Doc Martens. Now
khakis from the Gap are the king of pants, and Stride Rite, along
with many other companies, makes shoes that go well with khakis. As
a result, Stride Rite is upbeat about 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the company earned $19.8 million on sales of $515.7
million. In a Sept. 25 report, analyst Richter estimated it would
earn $28.4 million on sales of $540.9 million &UR;  &LR; in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But because of uncertainty about Stride Rite's licensed shoe
lines, Richter recently lowered his sales projections and earnings
estimates for fourth-quarter 1998 and for 1999. &UR;  &LR; And he said he may
lower them again following Friday's announcement that Stride Rite
is pulling the plug on the Levi's line.
</P>
<P>
   Because Levi's accounted for 3 percent of Stride Rite's
third-quarter sales, the move is not expected to have much impact.
``The long-term recovery of this company is driven by Keds,''
Richter said. ``And Keds have exceeded our expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   One challenge is improving sales of the Tommy Hilfiger line.
That job may fall to Diane M. Sullivan, head of the company's
licensed brands division, who is mentioned as a possible successor
to Siegel.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to giving Stride Rite more of a fashionable edge,
Siegel has presided over cost-cutting measures that moved shoe
production to factories overseas.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he brought in a new management team and helped
solve problems at a distribution center in Louisville, Ky., that
bedeviled the company in 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``My great disappointment is a lack of financial success,'' he
said. ``We have not achieved the level of stock performance that
shareholders deserve. But we've completely changed the culture of
the company, and we were in dire need of that.''

HAND-BALANCING RIPPEL BROTHERS GIVE CIRCUS UNUSUAL ACT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MCCABE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you watch the Rippel Bros. perform their act, you can't
wait to give them a hand. But it's certainly not the kind of hand
they give each other.
</P>
<P>
   The Hungarian brothers, Ferenc, 27, and Viktor, 25, are
hand-balancers, one of the more unusual acts in Ringling Bros. and
Barnum &AMP; Bailey Circus, the 127th edition of which opens
Wednesday &UR;  &LR; at the FleetCenter and continues through Oct. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Performing in the Bahamas in 1991, the brothers hit upon the
idea of doing their act painted in gold, making them look like
gilded statues that move. Audiences went for it in a big way and
they've been doing it ever since. They refer to themselves as
``living Oscars,'' after the Academy Award statuettes.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers, from Budapest, perform what is called an
``equilibristic'' act, Ferenc Rippel said over lunch recently,
carefully writing the word out on a napkin. He and his brother had
just finished demonstrating their skill for an appreciative crowd
of noontime strollers in the rotunda of Faneuil Hall Marketplace.
Rippel said the act has also been described as ``a lifestyle, an
extreme sport, slow-motion contortionists, a habit.'' There are
only five or six such performing groups in the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since balance is key to their act, the brothers must remain
virtually identical in weight _ 200 pounds each. They watch each
others' diet carefully. They manage their own act and appear to
share equally a desire to excel. Both love the United States, love
performing here, and have many friends here. Ferenc Rippel has been
married for two years. His brother Viktor grins and says he's
``never going to get married.''
</P>
<P>
   In each of their performances, Viktor supports Ferenc's entire
body weight _ with his head. ``If he goes up pounds, it's harder
for me,'' Viktor Rippel said. ``I watch every breadstick he eats.''
</P>
<P>
   The tricks they perform flow seamlessly from one to another.
They balance horizontally on a revolving platform, using their
strength and focused concentration to perform moves that often seem
to defy gravity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to keep in shape,'' Viktor Rippel said. ``Every part
of our body is visible. The body is our costume.''
</P>
<P>
   The brothers, sons of acrobats, began competing at sports
gymnastics, a popular form of acrobatics throughout Europe, at age
4. They attended the renowned Hungarian Artist School from 1982 to
'88. After that, while in Russia, they began working up their
hand-balancing routine. They developed it primarily because they
didn't want to split up and pursue separate, more traditional
careers ``as jugglers, on the high wire or low wire,'' Viktor
Rippel said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning, they made mistakes. ``We used to fight a lot
and hold each other in bad places,'' Ferenc said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   With perestroika, opportunities in the international world of
the circus opened up. ``We're not self-made millionaires,'' Ferenc
Rippel said. ``We just want to be.''

`CORPUS CHRISTI' ANYTHING BUT BLASPHEMOUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFFREY ERIC JENKINS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In these days of debased civil discourse, blasphemy
is in the eye of the beholder.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is Terrence McNally's controversial new play
``Corpus Christi,'' which opens Tuesday night at Manhattan Theatre
Club's Stage I. For the past five months, the public has been
treated to a media spectacle of protests and demonstrations, both
for and against the production because of its purported content.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the protests have made ``Corpus Christi'' the
hottest ticket in town since ``Cabaret'' opened earlier this year.
Audience members thread past protesters clad in pastel berets who
kneel on the pavement and recite Hail Marys. Entering the theater
building, the security checkpoints create a tension and a sense of
event. Once inside the theater space, though, anxieties dissipate.
</P>
<P>
   Designer Loy Arcenas has undermined theatrical artifice by
removing all wings and curtains, leaving a bare wooden playing
space in the center of the stage. Props and costumes are in plain
sight to the rear, the lighting is practical and spartan. The
actors chat comfortably among themselves before one of them
addresses the audience with a gentle warning of what is to come.
</P>
<P>
   What follows, though, is hardly shocking and scarcely
scandalous. Indeed, McNally and director Joe Mantello offer a
delicate and moving alternative to the ``greatest story ever
told.'' The overtones about homosexual relationships in the
apostolic inner circle certainly vary from accepted biblical
scholarship. But McNally clearly states that his point of view is
simply that.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-production rumors that a Christ-like figure named Joshua has
sex with his disciples prove untrue. ``Corpus Christi'' ultimately
is a modern-day allegory about the journey of an outsider from
childhood to manhood. The character of Joshua (Anson Mount) is a
sensitive young man who hears the voice of God telling him, ``This
is my son, in whom I take much delight.'' Born to his virgin mother
in a lowly fleabag hotel in Texas, he grows up a misfit who is
interested in the arts and isn't much good at sports.
</P>
<P>
   Attending Pontius Pilate High School in Corpus Christi, he is
tormented by the other boys for his difference and accused of being
``a queer.'' Rescued by the sexually predatory Judas (Josh Lucas),
Joshua finds a kind of warmth and acceptance in the arms of a man.
But whatever passes between Joshua and Judas _ we see no more than
a brief kiss _ is short-lived as the young seeker goes in search of
his life with God.
</P>
<P>
   Since late spring, the media here and abroad have fed at the
trough of ``obscenity'' and ``blasphemy'' when writing of the
play's subject matter. Although it hasn't quite had the guilty
attractions of the Monica Lewinsky story, the ``Corpus Christi''
imbroglio has drawn the interest of a Catholic civil rights group,
as well as an element of the lunatic fringe.
</P>
<P>
   You may recall hearing that the Manhattan Theatre Club pulled
the production from its schedule last May after receiving anonymous
phone threats to ``exterminate every member of the theater and burn
the place to the ground.'' Before the threats, however, the
Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights already had mounted
a campaign against the play, insisting that McNally excise certain
passages offensive to Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   But no one at the Catholic League had read or seen the play; it
is not unusual for new works to be unavailable before opening. So
the league relied on reports in the New York Times and the (London)
Guardian that referred, respectively, to the play's potentially
offensive and ``flagrantly blasphemous'' content.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing the play in previews last weekend, the Catholic
League released a statement calling the play ``a faithful rendition
of the gay stereotype.'' However, the news release quotes the play
inaccurately and insists that Joshua ``has sex with a man (Philip)
at his high school prom.'' Philip is neither present in the scene
mentioned, nor does ``sex'' occur. Also, if the league seriously
believes that ``Corpus Christi'' is meant to represent the actual,
biblical Jesus, then its leaders should remember that the priests
criticized by Jesus were Jewish, not Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   The theater's decision in May to yank the production also raised
a firestorm of protest from the artistic community. In support of
McNally, the noted South African playwright Athol Fugard withdrew a
play from the company's season. ``Angels in America'' author Tony
Kushner helped initiate a campaign of support for the production.
Hundreds of theater artists and administrators, including Seattle's
Gordon Edelstein, Mame Hunt, Eddie Levi Lee, Ben Moore, Laura Penn
and Warner Shook, signed a statement supporting the company's right
to free artistic expression.
</P>
<P>
   The production was reinstated, but not before the company
received assurances from the city of New York that its staff and
audiences would be protected. Metal detectors were installed in the
theater's lobby, other security measures were instituted and the
production moved forward.
</P>
<P>
   Attacked as a ``Jew guilty homosexual'' in the threatening phone
messages, McNally, who was raised Catholic, has been publicly
silent except for a note of triumph when he received his fourth
Tony Award in June for ``Ragtime.''
</P>
<P>
   Criticized by some in the gay community for his portrayal of gay
men in ``Love! Valour! Compassion!,'' McNally again may find
himself at odds with the same critics in addition to the Catholic
League. During Joshua's temptation in the desert, he meets Satan in
the form of the actor James Dean. Helping Satan in the temptation
of power and privilege, is the character of Judas. Does this imply
that the openly gay character of Judas is the tool of Satan? There
seems no other conclusion to draw. Surely, this is not offensive to
the Catholic League.
</P>
<P>
   Miracles familiar from the New Testament are enacted in ``Corpus
Christi,'' some with a jokey twist. Lazarus is raised from the dead
because Joshua can't stand the mournful wails of his family. A man
possessed by demons hurls profane vitriol, in words we know all too
well, at God and everyone until Joshua releases him from his
torment. An angry male hustler who is HIV-positive is healed,
emotionally and physically, by Joshua's enfolding arms.
</P>
<P>
   In medieval times, the Feast of Corpus Christi was a celebration
of the body of Christ that included theatrical entertainment aimed
at promoting understanding of the mystery of Christ's passion. In
the new play, the sexual content furor has obscured McNally's
sweetly human message advocating universal brotherhood and love for
one another.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, McNally teases Catholic school education here and
there, but is that truly blasphemous or hateful? Are there any
former Catholic school kids who don't make occasional jokes about
the nuns and priests who taught them (and cracked their knuckles
with rulers)?
</P>
<P>
   As histrionic elements of the media and publicity-seeking
watchdogs of morality go in search of the lewd and the profane, one
person's blasphemy may be another person's beauty. For all of the
Catholic League's hyperbole about hate speech, there is nothing
hateful in ``Corpus Christi.''
</P>
<P>
   And if others see it that way, why attack? Why not simply turn
the other cheek?

FAMOUS DYLAN CONCERT OF 1966 RELEASED COMMERCIALLY

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Not many pop stars attain the status of icon, not in
their lifetimes anyway, and not in the deepest sense of the word,
which carries connotations of the holy and stirs the faithful
beyond appreciation to a concentrated awe.
</P>
<P>
   If there is an iconic figure still roaming the landscape of
American pop, it's Bob Dylan _ maybe only Dylan, whose mystique in
recent years has grown, deepened, and broadened, even as his
creative output has dimmed.
</P>
<P>
   The proof was on display here last week at the Museum of
Television and Radio, where hundreds gathered to hear a panel
discussion on two old-new Dylan releases _ a double CD of his
famous May 17, 1966, concert in Manchester, England, and an
hourlong film of that concert, called ``Eat the Document,'' that
has not been seen anywhere for 26 years. (The museum, at 25 W. 52d
St., is showing it through Nov. 20.)
</P>
<P>
   The Manchester concert _ long available on pirate LPs but
released commercially by Columbia Tuesday, as ``Live 1966: The
`Royal Albert Hall' Concert'' _ was the penultimate date on Dylan's
first tour with an electric band. The tour with the group, called
the Hawks (later known as the Band), caused a historic uproar.
</P>
<P>
   The panelists waxed philosophic on the implications of this
band, this concert, the songs Dylan was writing and singing, the
transitions he was wrenching himself through, and the transitions
he was reflecting _ and amplifying, so to speak _ in society.
</P>
<P>
   Greil Marcus, the rock critic-historian and author of
``Invisible Republic,'' which links Dylan's work from this era to
an underground tradition of American folk music dating back a
century, laid out the context of the times.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an unprecedented, self-conscious revolution in all
the arts,'' he reminded the audience at the museum. ``People were
saying, `I can do what's never been done before, win what's never
been won before''' _ a Dylan lyric _ ``and going out and proving
it. There was Jean-Luc Godard's `Weekend,' Roth's `Portnoy's
Complaint.' People were saying, `Can you believe he's doing that?'
And most people were responding, `No, I can't. Give me more.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Rosenbaum, the lit-sleuth who has plumbed the depths of
texts from Shakespeare to Pynchon to Hitler, went further, seeing
the mid-'60s Dylan as foraging the dark corners of the
post-Holocaust subconscious.
</P>
<P>
   ``People often say he stopped doing protest songs at this time,
but I think he was shifting to a more radical protest,'' Rosenbaum
proclaimed. ``He's not protesting political injustice _ that's
taken for granted. He's protesting the very order of the universe,
or lack of it. It's a protest against the laws of gravity _ against
the lack of gravity, in the sense of seriousness and
meaningfulness. I think he's angry that the universe is absurd.''
Many of his songs are about being abandoned by a woman, but this is
metaphor. ``He's feeling that he's living in a universe that's been
abandoned by God.''
</P>
<P>
   All this started to seem a bit over the edge. But then another
panelist, D.A. Pennebaker _ who directed an earlier Dylan
documentary, the classic ``Don't Look Back,'' and served as
cameraman on ``Eat the Document'' _ supplied the coup de theatre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Samuel Beckett, before he died, asked me for a script of
`Don't Look Back,''' Pennebaker revealed. ``Beckett never referred
to Dylan by name. He always called him `The Poet.' He'd say, `Could
you bring me the script of The Poet?'''
</P>
<P>
   If Beckett, the 20th century's bleakest black-humor playwright,
saw a soul mate in Dylan, maybe Rosenbaum was on to something.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum himself added a capper. He interviewed Dylan at great
length in the late 1970s for Playboy. ``At one point,'' he
recalled, ``Dylan kept harping on about how all the troubles of our
world can be traced back to that Time magazine cover in the '60s
that read, `Is God Dead?' Dylan told me, `What if you were God?
What if you saw that cover? You'd be pissed off!'''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Invisible Republic,'' Marcus wrote that Dylan was shifting
to a more elemental, individual, genuinely traditional concept of
folk music than the social-protest songs of the early '60s _ a folk
music, as Dylan once described it, ``based on myth and the Bible
and plague and famine and all kinds of things like that, which are
nothing but mystery.'' It was a concept not incompatible with
electric thunder.
</P>
<P>
   The film and CD confirm the longstanding reports that much of
the audience hated this new sound. The previous summer, at the
Newport Folk Festival, Dylan had famously plugged in an electric
guitar and unleashed howls of rage. (Pete Seeger tried to cut
Dylan's power cords with an ax backstage.) Dylan himself was shaken
by the catcalls, and came back for a reprise strumming his acoustic
guitar.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time of the Manchester show, Marcus noted, the hoots
and hollers had become ``a game for Dylan.'' Pennebaker agreed:
``His idea of putting on a show that stunned people _ that's what
made him happy.'' At an earlier concert in France, Dylan came
onstage against the backdrop of a huge American flag _ during the
height of French anti-Americanism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dylan was celebrating insolence, as something that artists at
the top of their game sometimes radiate,'' Rosenbaum reflected.
``He knew he was doing something absolutely extraordinary and he
didn't care what people thought of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The degree of anger heard from the audience, on the second disc
of the concert (on the first, he plays solo acoustic to reverential
applause), is Munich-beer-hall frightening. At one point, Dylan
tries to start a song but he's drowned out and disoriented by the
angry masses, stomping their feet off the beat. People yell
``Sellout!'' and worse at every break.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus posited an eyebrow-raising thesis. Dylan's music, he
noted, came as no surprise to this audience. They had heard about
Newport. ``They knew exactly what they were going to be getting,
and they were ready to fight it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were British folk-music clubs all over the UK,'' he went
on, ``and they were run by the Communist Party.'' Even more than in
the States, where folkies tended to be sentimental leftists but not
hardball communists, this faction of the audience saw Dylan as a
traitor to the cause.
</P>
<P>
   Another panelist, Betsy Bowden _ a Chaucer professor at Rutgers
University who had just flown in from a conference in Arizona that
compared the concept albums of Dylan and Frank Sinatra _ thought
Marcus was going too far. ``I have a more benign attitude toward
folklorists,'' she shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the protesters' motivations, Dylan and the Band hammer
back by turning out their most riveting rock concert on record _
much fiercer than anything on ``The Basement Tapes'' or their 1974
reunion concert. Even now, long after the sound has been
assimilated, it feels like a gale of fresh air, a joyous fist of
free expression.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan sings that great refrain from ``Ballad of a Thin Man''
(``You know somethin's happenin'/-But you don't know what it is/-Do
you, Mr. Jones?'') with a wonderful, withering sneer. It's not
square suburbia that's Mr. Jones, it's this audience, it's his
former fans! And you can practically feel the shock bouncing off
the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the concert, someone cries out ``Judas!'' and
many laugh and applaud. Dylan shouts back, ``I don't believe you''
_ an odd response, until you remember that, a bit earlier, he sang
his 1964 song called ``I Don't Believe You,'' about a girl whose
``skirt swayed as the guitar played/her mouth was watery and wet''
but the next morning ``acts like we never met.'' Again, he's
telling his audience: You're like that girl. You're the turncoat.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he turns to guitarist Robbie Robertson, tells him, ``Play
(expletive) loud!'' and launches into a mind-blowingly raucous
rendition of ``Like a Rolling Stone,'' laying into the line that
ends ``... couldn't yoooouuuuuuu!'' with cheery contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan and the Hawks had more than 50 dates scheduled into the
fall. Who knows where they would have taken this music? But then
Dylan had his motorcycle accident, he went into seclusion, the
Hawks moved on to become the Band, the Zeitgeist changed _ the
folk-rock schism, which Dylan had straddled and incited, came down
on rock's side _ and Dylan emerged with a newer sound still (which
culminated in his masterpiece, ``Blood on the Tracks'').
</P>
<P>
   On that night in Manchester, though, the doors of history can
clearly be seen and heard swinging. As Marcus promised the crowd at
the museum, ``You've never heard anything like this.''

 By MIKHAIL GORBACHEV  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    On Oct. 7 millions of people demonstrated in the streets of
Russian cities. Their protest was responsible, their behavior
moderate, with no sign of extremism.
 &HT;    The demonstrators' main demand was for the resignation of
President Yeltsin and early elections of both the president and the
State Duma. It was a clear verdict on the political regime and the
kind of ``shock'' reforms that the country has had to endure for
the past seven years.
 &HT;    Russia is at a dangerous threshold. The clock shows five minutes
to midnight.
 &HT;    Yet, observers noted, the government of Yevgeny Primakov was
spared the demonstrators' criticism. Primakov, his first deputy
Yuri Maslyukov and the new Central Bank president Viktor
Gerashchenko had not been eager for jobs in the Russian cabinet. In
fact, they took some time before deciding to come on board. That
they finally agreed to carry this burden in the present dire
circumstances is a credit to them. These people are capable of
giving priority to the national interests rather than the narrow
interest of those who have become fabulously and unjustifiably rich
during the years of pseudo-reforms.
 &HT;    The new government, however, has already come under criticism
from extreme free-marketeers in Russia and in the West. Primakov is
being accused of dragging his feet and of lacking a clear economic
program. There is concern that the team may backtrack from market
economics. Much is being made of their past, such as the fact that
Maslyukov was chairman of Gosplan, the Soviet Union's central
planning agency.
 &HT;    I must disagree with this rush to judgment. I know these men,
their views and their character. During the years of perestroika
they were firmly in favor of reforms.
 &HT;    In spring 1990, Maslyukov was ready to resign from Prime
Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov's government, accusing him of stalling on
much-needed change. Other members of the new cabinet have also
shown on many occasions their commitment to socially responsible
market economics and democracy.
 &HT;    It would certainly be too soon to demand that they produce an
elaborate, detailed program or far-reaching decisions on how to
advance reforms at the very moment they have to focus on how to
stabilize the overall situation and avoid total disaster. This
might require measures, some of which could resemble a return to
command economics. But don't rush to label the new government
``anti-reform.''
 &HT;    The steps that may be needed to take the situation in hand do
not mean that reforms are being abandoned. They are the price that
must be paid for the misguided policies of the recent past. If
chaos became total, any reforms would have to be written off and we
would see a very different government, an economic dictatorship.
 &HT;    During the time needed to put the real economy _ the production
of goods and services _ back on track, we shall need aid and loans.
Even more than aid, we shall need direct investment and cooperation
projects. After what happened here, creditors and investors are
understandably doubtful about dealing with Russia. I feel, however,
that Primakov and Gerashchenko will be able to persuade the world
that they are serious people and responsible partners.
 &HT;    So both the West and our own economic radicals would do well not
to push the new team. Do not scare people with the prospect of a
``return to communism.'' Russia has made an irrevocable choice.
Even the communists, the lunatic fringe excepted, are saying that
the clock cannot be turned back. So let us not panic; let us work
with quiet determination.
 &HT;    I am afraid, though, that the government could be dealt a blow
from an unexpected quarter, and where it is least protected. I am
afraid the president might try to meddle in the government's work.
Even worse, he could reshuffle it before it had a chance to make a
difference. I have reason to believe that Yeltsin's entourage is
already intriguing to make this happen.
 &HT;    The president should be reminded that such things have always
turned out badly, for himself as well as for the country. It would
be best for all of us if the president gave the Primakov government
a carte blanche _ and then called for early elections of president
and parliament.
 &HT;    Concerns about the results of early elections are, I believe,
exaggerated. The Russians will not support extremists or
irresponsible populists. Today, much more than before, there is a
good chance for the emergence of a coalition of moderate, centrist
forces capable of winning a majority in the Duma and fielding a
strong candidate for president. Tomorrow, that chance could
disappear.
 &HT;    Who that candidate would be depends in large part on the
``content'' of the presidency. I believe that the constitution
should be amended in order to allocate more power to the parliament
and the cabinet.
 &HT;    With a more reasonable balance of government powers, the
president would no longer be a monarch in democratic clothing, nor
would he be able to usurp power and paralyze the federal
government, as Yeltsin was able to do.
 &HT;    The president would become a true guardian of the constitution
and of the people's rights and freedoms _ the nation's moral and
political leader. Primakov could turn out to be just the right man
for this role.
 &HT;    The Cabinet of Ministers would then become the main body of the
executive branch of government. And, although the mayor of Moscow,
Yuri Luzhkov, has already declared his readiness to run for
president, I think that he is better suited for the role of prime
minister.
 &HT;    I urge our Western partners to analyze the political realignment
now under way in Russia without prejudging it and with a
willingness to help Russia. Objectively, Russia may now have a
chance to begin recovering, and gradually reemerge as a serious and
dependable international player.

   UNDATED - In the contest between good and evil, good often looks
like a sap. The bad guys' deeds get the press. Their actions
command attention that decency and gentleness can't match.
</P>
<P>
   Take what happened in Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   The two men charged with beating another to death are national
names. They are charged with murderous brutality against a man
because he was a homosexual. That has led to calls for new hate
crimes legislation. It has underlined what some people in Laramie
say is a ``complacency and apathy'' about hostility toward gays and
lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney share the spotlight because
of their alleged viciousness. Their capacity for evil.
</P>
<P>
   They are charged with luring Matthew Shepard from a bar and
beating him so savagely that he died five days later. Kristen
Price, McKinney's girlfriend and mother of their 4-month-old son,
told the ``Denver Post'' the two men were embarrassed because
Shepard had made a pass at them. They wanted to get even, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard was pistol-whipped with a .357 Magnum. A bicyclist found
him unconscious and tied to a fence post outside town.
</P>
<P>
   The assailants earned their infamy. The town that spawned them
deserves scrutiny. Charges that Shepard was targeted for violent
assault because of his sexual orientation are like a shrieking
alarm in Laramie, which is called the ``hometown'' of Wyoming _
nicknamed the Equality State because it was the first to let women
vote.
</P>
<P>
   The nation can't ignore the injustice of prejudice directed at
people simply because of their sexual orientation. America can't
ignore the human cost of hating someone so much that the person
ceases to be treated as human.
</P>
<P>
   But there is something else in this sad story that deserves
attention.
</P>
<P>
   The response to Shepard's beating was a flash of decency from
people who refuse to accept such actions.
</P>
<P>
   About a thousand people met for a candlelight vigil Sunday night
near the University of Wyoming campus to support Shepard. There was
another candlelight vigil at the Fort Collins, Colo., hospital
where he lay dying. There was a parade in his honor. So many
flowers arrived at the hospital in his name that staff had to
divert some to other patients. His room was full.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Shepard may not have known of the kindness of these
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   But the nation knows.
</P>
<P>
   And in the name of wiping out hate, the nation ought to
celebrate the good that continues to outnumber the evil. &QL;

CREDIT INDUSTRY HAS FRIENDS IN HIGH PLACES 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Edits to reflect legislation appears doomed in Congress)  
 Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT WINOKUR  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Plastic, fantastic as it is, is a major American
addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer bankruptcy filings are up 66 percent in the last five
years, to 1.35 million annually, according to the American
Bankruptcy Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Could blame lie with the sweet-talking guys at MBNA and
Providian and everyone else pushing easy credit? Could it have to
do with the fact that credit-card solicitations totaled 3 billion
last year?
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren thinks so. So do
San Francisco-area bankruptcy lawyers Norma Hammes and Irving
Kornfield, and their colleague, David Ebert of Fort Worth, Texas,
whose grade-school daughters have received applications in the
mail. All four hold the credit avalanche responsible for the
bankruptcy explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the mid-'80s consumer debt became vastly more profitable
than any other kind of lending activity because state usury laws
were effectively overturned,'' Warren said. ``Today, credit card
lending is twice as profitable as all other lending activity, even
when you account for costs and losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the mid-'80s consumer debt also just took off _ and guess
what? Bankruptcies went right through the roof behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren and the bankruptcy lawyers also are aghast that
Republican leaders in Congress _ after being lobbied hard and
lavishly by the credit industry _ pushed sweeping bankruptcy reform
legislation that would have made it much more difficult for
families who get in over their heads to wipe the slate clean while
protecting critical assets.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last-minute rush of legislation, the legislation
appeared doomed. Still consumer advocates bristled at changes that
they say would have hurt families struggling with debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is special-interest legislation, period,'' Warren said.
</P>
<P>
   Ebert called the legislation efforts by creditors ``to empower
the government to collect debts owed to them.''
</P>
<P>
   People like Sen. Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican, say _
correctly _ that bankruptcy should be a last resort, not a
financial planning tool. But then they cite extreme examples of
abuses under current law, such as the Virginia man who filed under
Chapter 7 but managed to keep his $640,000 race horse. This is
terribly misleading, consumer advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   Warren: ``The median income of Chapter 7 filers in 1997 was
$17,652 _ that's momma and daddy and the kid's paper route.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammes, a San Jose lawyer who heads the National Association of
Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys, said she doesn't believe the many
members of the lawmakers backing the proposed law understand the
damage it would do to hard-working people down on their luck
because of job loss or medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Kornfield, an Oakland lawyer who served as a bankruptcy trustee
in about 10,000 cases between 1969 and 1981, said the frequency of
abusive bankruptcy filings actually is low.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're losing so much money, why did Citicorp pay $3.5
billion to AT&AMP;T to buy the Universal Card?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because when you have friends in high places _ Congress,
namely _ consumer debt is a high-profit narcotic you can push
without concern for the consequences.

STARMEDIA BANKS ON GROWTH OF INTERNET IN LATIN AMERICAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Private investors are betting nearly $100
million that Latin America will be the next front in the
information revolution.
</P>
<P>
   StarMedia Inc., a 2-year-old New York-based Internet company
that publishes a multifeature Web site exclusively for Latin
America, announced Monday it had received $80 million in private
funding.
</P>
<P>
   That investment, made by such companies as Warburg, Pincus &AMP;
Co., General Electric Equity Capital Group and Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter &AMP; Co., brings StarMedia's investor war chest to $96.1
million, gathered since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say this is the largest private investment in a
privately held on-line company.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have managed to come up with a pretty big capital raising
at the intersection of two of the most volatile investment themes
in America: the Internet and Latin America,'' said Lanny Baker, an
analyst of on-line media industry for Salomon Smith Barney in San
Francisco. ``That's pretty impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are constructing a pan-country network for Spanish- and
Portuguese-speaking people,'' said StarMedia's 32-year-old founder,
chairman and chief executive Fernando Espuela. ``This round of
financing will let us continue to become a unifying force across
Latin America.''
</P>
<P>
   The StarMedia Web site is fashioned after two well-known Web
success stories: America Online and Yahoo. Like AOL, StarMedia
contains news, free e-mail, classifieds and personal ads, chat
rooms and other content, which is generated by StarMedia staff
located in New York, Miami and eight Latin American countries,
including Brazil, Mexico and Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Like Yahoo, StarMedia does not charge a fee for access, instead
relying on advertisements from companies such as Ford and Citibank
to generate revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We drew from both models,'' said Espuela, who expects his
company to be profitable by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Espuela said StarMedia was created, in part, to take advantage
of the explosive growth in Latin America Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey conducted by the Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi
advertising agency, Latin American computer users will increase
fivefold, to some 34 million, by the turn of the century. U.S.
computer use, by contrast, will increase threefold by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Espuela said the Latin America Internet market is skipping the
development stage and moving right into a full-fledged mass media.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a market that's leapfrogging technologies,'' Espuela
said. ``Latin America isn't going through all this technological
revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Espuela, a native of Uruguay, says the idea for StarMedia came
to him while he was sitting on a mountain in Nepal, trying to
decide what to do with his life after reaching the executive ranks
of AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was feeling very empty,'' he said. ``I had gotten this
promotion, but I really didn't want it. Then I had a realization,
that the Internet was going to be the biggest thing, ever.''
</P>
<P>
   StarMedia is just one player in the burgeoning
non-English-speaking Web field, which has been estimated to now
include some 107 million users and counting. According to
Emarketer, a New York-based Internet research group, the number of
Internet users from outside the United States will begin to
outnumber those inside the country by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   And StarMedia isn't playing on an empty field. Latin America's
explosive Internet growth has spawned a number of popular Web
sites, including Brazil's Universo Online and Zaz. Both of these
sites dominate the coveted Brazilian Internet on-line market, in
which an estimated 79 percent of all Internet connections are made
by consumers, according to a recent study by IDC, a Framingham,
Mass., technology research firm. That same study found that Mexico
home users account for only 29 percent of Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet in Latin America is just so new,'' Baker said.
``Although StarMedia has grabbed a huge brand recognition lead in a
very short time, there's going to be a lot of jockeying for
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``But having that $96 million is going to certainly help
StarBright. No question about that,'' he said.

   MASHED-POTATOES (Undated) _ Comfort food _ that buzz phrase
embracing all the bland, soft satisfactions of childhood eating _
doesn't quite have the cachet now that it did a few years ago, when
restaurants everywhere were trying to outdo each other in the
evocation of home and hearth. But somehow, one of those
quintessentially comforting foods, mashed potatoes, has not only
held on in popularity but also managed to ease right into the
turbulent mainstream of today's creative cookery. By Florence
Fabricant.

<P>
   EATZI-MARKET (New York) _ It's not a restaurant. It's not a
grocery store. It's Eatzi's Market and Bakery, the food store that
ate Dallas. Now, in the boldest out-of-town incursion since George
Steinbrenner bought the Yankees, it has planted its cowboy boots
right in Macy's basement. As stunned shoppers in Dallas, Houston
and Atlanta already know, Eatzi's means high-energy and high-volume
(in both senses of the word). It's a prepared-food store in which
dozens of chefs, working in open kitchens, turn out hundreds of
dishes every day, with Puccini arias blasting away in the
background. By William Grimes.
</P>
<P>
   SEASONAL-FOOD (New York) _ It's autumn in New York. A chill is
nudging through the last trace of summer's warmth, and the leaves
hint of turning. The signs are impossible to miss _ except, maybe,
if you're a chef. After all the lip service New York's best cooks
have given to the virtues of seasonal cooking, some of them have
decided that they'll cook seasonally, all right, but they'll be the
ones to choose exactly which season. By Amanda Hesser.
</P>
<P>
   MASTIC-ICE-CREAM (New York) _ Of the eight Greek dessert choices
on the menu at Molyvos, the one ordered least is mastic ice cream
with Commandaria and fig sauce. Mastic ice cream? True, the dessert
suffers from a name-image problem: it's not exactly loaded with
lyricism. It's unfamiliar, too, except to those who know this rare
and costly flavoring; at $60 to more than $100 a pound, mastic
might be called the caviar of flavors. By Suzanne Hamlin.

   As expected, though by a much smaller margin than foreseen,
Fernando Henrique Cardoso was re-elected president of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   As expected also, his country will receive an aid package of
about $30 billion from the international financial community,
though the difficulties in raising it are also somewhat greater
than forecast.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, finally, Cardoso will have to begin his second
four-year term with a draconian austerity program, though
resistance to it in the Brazilian congress and state governments
will be stronger than anticipated. Why? It is a program that will
worsen unemployment, recession, skyrocketing interest rates and
social inequality.
</P>
<P>
   And by now, for this nation trapped in a self-induced economic
downturn since last October, a moderate devaluation of the currency
is also likely in store.
</P>
<P>
   So what lessons can be drawn?
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso's re-election entailed a heavy cost for Brazil. More
than $30 billion in reserves were spent over the last two months to
prevent a devaluation in Brazil's currency that probably will occur
anyway but that coming sooner would have doomed Cardoso's bid for
another term.
</P>
<P>
   The new currency put in place by Cardoso in 1994, when he was
finance minister, allowed him to control Brazil's hyperinflation
and was sufficiently impressive to lead to his first-term election
as president. In October 1997, when the Asian financial crisis hit,
millions of Brazilians were laid off while the government, seeking
to bolster the real, was forced to cut spending, raise interest
rates and cool down the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Since October, Brazil's interest rates have remained at
stratospheric levels. Without them, the tens of billions of foreign
dollars the country sought to attract would have left, or never
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   There were options to Cardoso's measures. In fact, the most
important costs incurred by Brazil are the very changes a different
president might have implemented:
</P>
<P>
   _ to give up the frozen exchange rate once inflation had been
brought under control;
</P>
<P>
   _ to discourage speculative capital from entering the country
through controls and taxes on entry or early exit.
</P>
<P>
   This, together with a different set of alliances and a much
greater effort to reduce inequality, attain high growth rates and
create millions of stable, decent paying jobs, would have been the
heart of an alternative to Cardoso's re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Which points directly to the second lesson.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian left, led for the third time in 10 years by former
metalworker Luiz Ignacio Lula da Silva, must answer a number of
tough questions today that it has avoided for more than a decade.
Some are the typical, superficial charges made against da Silva _
that he represents an insufficiently ``modernized'' left and
opposes many features of the so-called neo-liberal economic reform
program applied in Brazil and elsewhere in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   But let's reach beyond the standard, often senseless criticism
directed at the left for merely being the left.
</P>
<P>
   The key question in Brazil is the same as in Mexico, Chile, El
Salvador and Argentina _ all countries where a strong left will be
contending for the presidency between now and the year 2000. It is
whether the left should contend on its principles alone, without
compromising its stances, even if that foretells defeat, or instead
support centrist candidates and programs able to win, but
inevitably less committed to social change.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, the left wing of da Silva's Workers' Party forced him
to be their standard bearer for the third time in order to avoid
supporting a more centrist, appealing candidate, the former
governor and finance minister, Ciro Gomes. Had the party adopted
Gomes as their candidate from the outset, they might have been able
to take better advantage of a theoretically ideal situation: an
incumbent running on his economic program at the precise moment it
collapses.
</P>
<P>
   As the young, competent, professional opposition candidate
running amid an intensifying economic and social crisis, with
rising unemployment and recession, Gomes might have attracted a
combination of the party's strong labor, peasant and student
constituency with a ready middle-class electorate.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Workers' Party machinery refused to risk a
reduced presence in Brazil's congress and statehouses in exchange
for a definite shot at the presidency. They forced da Silva to run,
largely against his will. The result was the re-election of
Cardoso, who could have been beat _ and indeed, even da Silva did
substantially better than last-minute polls suggested.
</P>
<P>
   There is a case to be made for standing on principle and losing.
But in a region where the left has been banned from power for so
many years yet, at the same time, remains on-target in so many of
its analyses and criticisms of the status quo, there is probably a
better case to be made for compromise and victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Argentine and Chilean left seem to have reached this
conclusion; the Salvadorean and Mexican left, not quite yet. The
example of what just happened in Brazil might serve them all in
good stead.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGHLAND PARK, N.J. _ This time it's not the tiresome adventure
that forever has joined Bill Clinton with Monica Lewinsky, but a
real love story, without disgraceful power struggles or treacherous
friends.
</P>
<P>
   The central character in this story is Simone de Beauvoir. The
other one isn't Jean-Paul Sartre (or, at least not the only one),
but rather Nelson Algren, the American novelist, for whom Beauvoir
felt, between 1947 and 1951, an intense and submissive passion, ``a
slave's passion,'' as she called it.
</P>
<P>
   The form of the story is epistolar, as in the moral fables of
the 18th century: letters between both lovers, in English _ a
language Beauvoir handled masterfully _ from Paris to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The story is told in a book published in early October, titled
``A Transatlantic Love Affair,'' containing the letters of
Beauvoir, not those of Algren. In the third volume of her
autobiography, ``La force des Choses'' (1963), Beauvoir had already
revealed long excerpts from his letters to her.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Beauvoir is popular right now. A long New
York Times article published in September mentions about 10 recent
books and essays that have tried to determine how much of Sartre's
ideas, and especially his ``Being and Nothing,'' came from the mind
of his most devoted disciple.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few years ago, most biographers were convinced it was
Sartre who, between 1929 and 1930 _ when she was 21 and he was 24 _
had imposed the laws that permitted them to share a physical and
intellectual passion, yet still have other relationships and talk
about them without any hint of jealousy. This made it necessary, of
course, for both of them to live in separate homes.
</P>
<P>
   For a time Beauvoir was Sartre's privileged relationship and
vice-versa: Each had the right to enter the other's life at any
time of day or night and know before anyone else what the other was
doing. Lying was forbidden. ``Sincerity (or transparency) is
something I can't renounce,'' Sartre wrote at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, they had the obligation not to ask secrets. It was
understood that ``circumstantial'' loves were also short lived, and
that no unforeseeable passion could destroy the real and ironclad
``essential love.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Beauvoir who revealed the pleasures and torments of this
arrangement. Sartre, the supposed proponent of the idea, only
mentioned it marginally and published almost nothing about it.
</P>
<P>
   He was ugly, shortsighted and awkward, while she was very
attractive. In the letters to Algren we also discover he was a
lousy lover. With the American writer _ who wrote ``The Man With
the Golden Arm,'' among other minor books _ Beauvoir discovered the
joys of the flesh, and so she declares: ``I belong to you, Nelson.
I am your small fetish.'' Everything she could feel as a woman she
felt with Algren before anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   For a long a time, I had thought Beauvoir acted as a sort of
intellectual parasite on Sartre, living in the shadow of his breath
so she could turn it into words. I should have known I was wrong
when Sartre himself, in his ``Letters to the Beaver'' (Beauvoir was
called ``Beaver'' by many people because of her energy and capacity
for work), revealed that he, not she, was the vassal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to enforce my liberty before women,'' Sartre wrote,
``which was comical because it was I who ran after them. One of
those days, I was trapped. The Beaver accepted that liberty, and
she kept it for herself.''
</P>
<P>
   This theme of freedom or the lack of it among couples was a big
rallying point in the Western world during the '60s. Part of the
hippie revolution, as well as the revolutionary ideals in Latin
America during that decade and the next, had to do with the search
for sexual equality as a form of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Sartre's and Beauvoir's pact looked like an ideal way to escape
conventional mores. They shared everything and owed nothing to each
other. But in the end, it was a disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   When she was in love with Algren (while the whole world thought
she loved Sartre), Beauvoir wrote one of the basic treatises of
feminism: ``The Second Sex,'' her masterful essay in two volumes.
As far as anybody knows, she didn't even mention it to Algren.
Whenever she spoke to him about her books, she did it in passing,
not giving it any importance, as though she was ashamed of them.
</P>
<P>
   This is a strange twist on her feminine condition: With Sartre,
who was her equal, she acted arrogant, capricious and erudite. With
Algren, son of a proletarian Detroit family, who was far below
Beauvoir in intellectual curiosity, she acted courteously and even
servile, as though she wanted to be excused for her intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear, my dearest,'' she wrote when they were about to share a
cabin near Lake Michigan: ``I'm going to wash the floors, cook all
the meals. I'm going to write not only my books, but yours also.''
</P>
<P>
   As with Sartre, it was Beauvoir who got the most creative
benefit from this other relationship. In 1954 she published another
novel, ``The Mandarins,'' in which Algren appears almost exactly as
he was, but with another name, Lewis. In ``La Force de Choses'' she
decided to go even further and wrote their love story with
painstaking detail. Algren, very annoyed, tried to answer back in
several articles published by Harper's and Playboy. But by then
(1963), she was too famous and he was a mere shadow in the literary
world.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows what Beauvoir did with Sartre. She told
everything about him in writing. Loves, intellectual fights, work,
personal habits, senility. Everything she knew about Sartre was
transformed into words. But it seems her curiosity about other
peoples' intimate lives was used to hide whatever curiosity
Beauvoir must have felt about herself.
</P>
<P>
   In her memoirs, she never mentions even one of her failures in
love or letting herself go in pleasure. She is as shameless about
revealing what her lovers did as she is modest about her own
intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   But the letters to Algren show us a Beauvoir capable of begging,
suffering and living love in an impetuous and almost adolescent
way, with a tenderness that almost inspires compassion.
</P>
<P>
   At least in the four years from 1947 to 1951 _ when she wrote
``The Mandarins'' and ``The Second Sex,'' her two masterpieces, she
showed she could be as vulnerable and awkward in love as any other
human being. In this image of her smallness lies a great deal of
her greatness. The rest is only hurt feelings, or maybe pride.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer of 1950, in the cabin in Lake Michigan, Algren
told her unexpectedly he didn't love her anymore. They met in the
same place, a year later, and almost didn't touch each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be happy, my darling'' she wrote to him from New York's
airport, in her goodbye letter. ``Be happy and save a small corner
in the attic of your heart.''
</P>
<P>
   With those words, Beauvoir left the realm of sentiment and
entered the world of pure intelligence, where sadness is almost
absent, but happiness is almost as scarce.

AIRLINE PASSENGERS LIVING IN THE `ZONE' 
 
By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The term ``peanut fares'' may soon take on new meaning in the
sky.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Transportation has notified U.S. airlines of
its position that peanut-free ``buffer zones'' should be created
aboard airplanes upon advance request by passengers with medically
documented severe allergies to peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   These zones would consist, at the minimum, of the passengers'
row and the rows immediately in front and behind.
</P>
<P>
   No, this isn't a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Admit it: No offense to thousands of Americans said to be
bothered by peanuts, but your immediate reaction _ like mine _ was
to laugh, right? I can just envision an already-beleaguered flight
attendant patrolling the aisle prior to takeoff, asking, ``Is your
seat belt fastened? Your briefcase all the way beneath your seat?
All peanuts locked in your purse?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A peanut tax? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Will those passengers still requesting peanuts _ the only
``cuisine'' served on some flights these days _ pay a higher
tariff? Perhaps a peanut tax? And will there be separate seating
sections for those preferring their peanuts salted, honey-roasted
or mixed with cashews and almonds?
</P>
<P>
   But, then, I got to thinking that the DOT may be onto something
here. Modern-day computer systems are so advanced that, utilizing
sophisticated passenger profiles, these peanut-free zones can be
established _ and adjusted _ within seconds for individual flights.
</P>
<P>
   So why stop with peanuts? Welcome to Air Shattuck, where we
really organize cabin interiors.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with ``no-conversation'' buffer zones. Have you ever
plopped into a middle seat dog-tired and ready for a catnap only to
be verbally accosted by the guy on the aisle determined to
embellish every detail about his job, his car, his family or _ my
predicament on one recent flight _ his gallbladder surgery?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, we'll still encourage courtesy how-do-you-do's throughout
the aircraft. But if you intend to babble on incessantly at 35,000
feet, you'll be assigned elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also be required to let us know in advance if you plan to
use a laptop or if you intend to make more than one call on the
airphone at your seat. And for overnight flights, we'll separate
those who wish to read and those who prefer to sleep _ with an
additional distinction among the second group for snorers and
nonsnorers.
</P>
<P>
   Those who disdain cologne or perfume, or worse, deodorant _
another allergy, I presume _ will be grouped, too. Maybe with the
cargo.
</P>
<P>
   We'll require a medical certificate attesting to bladder size
and function. No stepping on innocent toes in a frantic rush aboard
Air Shattuck; passengers with weak bladders will automatically get
an aisle seat near the lavatory.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rest easy &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We'll also keep recliners and nonrecliners apart. Isn't it
amazing how, just as you release the food tray _ in the
peanuts-allowed section, that is _ the passenger in the row ahead
adjusts his seat so that his hair is in your lap? Be thankful at
least that he isn't Dennis Rodman. But we'll solve that problem.
With our passenger profile system, all reclining passengers will
sit together.
</P>
<P>
   I was going to create a ``kid zone,'' too. But Israel's El Air
Airlines beat me to it. El Air's new 15-row, 150-seat section on
some Boeing 747 jets caters specifically to families with small
children; passengers receive a kit with diapers, formula and a
pacifier, and only G-rated videos are shown on movie screens in the
zone.
</P>
<P>
   Now, shame on you for requesting X-rated movies in the
``adults-only'' sections.
</P>
<P>
   Those kiddie zones give me an idea, though. If we put enough
tiny tots together in one section of the plane, we can squeeze more
seats into those rows. That will allow us _ without affecting
revenues _ to establish separate ``wide-bodied sections.'' (Hey,
it's my airline!)
</P>
<P>
   Or with passenger profiles, maybe we'll just require an advance
listing of waist sizes _ I'm already shamed enough to begin
weight-reduction program No. 4,621 _ and make certain a stringbean
sits between every two heavyweights.
</P>
<P>
   I won't get into religious preferences. Or politics. Well, with
these exceptions: Republicans will be seated near the right wing,
Democrats beside the left wing.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and one other thing: Avid Starr backers and Clinton
supporters will all be assigned to the no-conversation zone. With
G-rated videos.
</P>
<P>
   Time to stop. I've got to purchase popcorn for folks in the
peanut-free zone.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone allergic to melted butter? &QL;

 FROM: Washingtonian Magazine  
 &HT;    The 20th century opened with Sigmund Freud publishing ``The
Interpretation of Dreams'' and closes with Freud so controversial
that not long ago the Library of Congress postponed an exhibit on
him. In October the library again hopes to display its large
collection of original Freud works.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, psychiatrists such as Sandra Gail Hershberg practice
Freud's craft and use his techniques.
 &HT;    Born and raised in the Bronx, N.Y., Dr. Hershberg graduated from
New York University and Yale Medical School. After an internship in
pediatrics at the University Hospitals of Cleveland and a residency
in general psychiatry at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, she
completed a fellowship in child and adolescent psychiatry. She is a
graduate of the Washington Psychoanalytic Institute.
 &HT;    Hershberg specializes in child and adolescent psychiatry, the
psychology of female development, and the psychological dimensions
of medical illness. She lives in Bethesda with her husband, a
physician, and their two adolescent daughters. She enjoys reading
fiction, antiquing, watching old movies and biking.
 &HT;    In her office, lined with Freud's complete works and featuring a
couch, we discussed what she's learned.
 -0 
 &HT;    KEN ADELMAN: What makes Freud so incendiary a century after he
started writing?
 &HT;    DR. SANDRA GAIL HERSHBERG: Three things come to mind. People
today often view psychoanalysis negatively _ as a luxury treatment
that takes a long time and is very expensive. So it's thought that
Freud's method doesn't work any longer. At least, that it's been
surpassed by medication, group therapy, family counseling, or other
techniques. I've found that's wrong.
 &HT;    The psychoanalytic method is alive and well. To me it's an
exciting and meaningful treatment. But it's no quick fix. People
now seek to do everything faster and faster. Western Union's been
replaced by the Internet. So many people no longer have the
patience for psychoanalysis they once did.
 &HT;    Second is this big category summarized as comprising ``women.''
The way Freud viewed women _ as having inferior superegos and penis
envy and all that _ opened him to harsh criticism. I'm with the
critics here. I don't agree with Freud much on this score. Some of
what he said on women has some relevance. But there are much more
complex and productive ways of looking at women and gender than
what he presented.
 &HT;    Third is Freud's treatment of sexual seduction and abuse as a
type of fantasy. He initially did think there was real sexual
abuse, but then switched when he attributed patient accounts to
subconscious fantasies.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What did Freud get right?
 &HT;    A: When considering Freud in his own times _ he was a pioneer,
there was no one before him; he used his cases and his
self-analysis as data _ I'm impressed at how much Freud got right.
Every brilliant individual who makes discoveries makes errors along
the way. Freud made many important contributions.
 &HT;    First and foremost was the nature of the inner life, the
significance and meaning of the unconscious. Freud pioneered the
use of free association. Through his analyses of others and
self-analysis, Freud delineated the concept of psychosexual
development, the child's progression through various developmental
stages.
 &HT;    Unconscious motivation was and is an enormous discovery. It
permeates our lives and culture. Fantasy and creativity are central
to modern life. The fact that we never fully know our less rational
motivation is a staggering insight. Freud developed all that.
 &HT;    Moreover, Freud showed greatness in his willingness to revise
his theories based on new clinical information. He was thus
openminded in an honest, scientific way. Freud got carried away by
his ideas and his narcissism in deciding to psychoanalyze his
daughter Anna. His putting his daughter on the couch and hearing
her innermost thoughts and fantasies in that way breached an
important boundary.
 &HT;    Clearly Anna Freud identified with her father through her
trailblazing work with children and her defining contributions in
the field of child development and child psychoanalysis.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Was Freud an attack on free will?
 &HT;    A: I don't see it that way. Not at all. Because of unconscious
factors, we make choices on the basis of more than rational free
will. That's true. But Freud's thrust makes one freer, not less
free. For people truly suffering _ as his patients did, as many of
my patients do, and as all of us do from time to time throughout
our lives _ Freud showed us a technique to better understand and
treat conflicts that result in feelings of shame, disgust, guilt,
etc.
 &HT;    Freud frees us by enabling us to be aware of inner connections
and see deeper motivations. That's at least been my experience with
patients. Once they're able to peer into their innermost feelings,
memories, fantasies, they can then make real choices. Freud knew
psychology and biology went together. As a trained neurologist, he
always searched for the biological basis of psychology. The concept
of mind versus brain interested him deeply.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Why should someone choose psychoanalysis over drugs, a
family-systems approach, group therapy or yoga?
 &HT;    A: Pharmacotherapy helps with symptom relief. Drugs can
accompany psychoanalysis or another therapy for someone who's
extremely depressed or with a manic-depressive disorder.
Psychoanalysis works best with patients who suffer from traumas or
other early experiences they haven't integrated well.
 &HT;    It opens up an opportunity to be in a safe situation with
someone committed to exploring such experiences in depth. This
enables the patient to transform internal representations and thus
to act and feel better. They can be freer.
 &HT;    Granted, other therapies do that too. But to me psychoanalysis
provides that help in a deeper and broader way than the other
approaches. It opens a greater sense of meaning and knowing one's
internal motivations.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Do you still use a couch?
 &HT;    A: Yes. I usually sit behind the patient, out of view _ like
Freud. The patient's usually lying down.
 &HT;    Q: What's your average length of treating one patient?
 &HT;    A: More than two years and up to 10 or 12 years _ or more. It
really depends.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: How did you feel as a patient?
 &HT;    A: Undergoing psychoanalysis was an essential part of my
professional training. It had a very important, even dramatic,
impact upon my life and it made me more aware of what the process
is like for the patient. That made me a better analyst because I
both knew myself better and knew what this process was like on the
other side of the couch.
 &HT;    Psychoanalysis made me much more aware of who I am as a person _
what interests me, how I pursue creative interests, act as a
parent, and what I carry from my own childhood which then gets
aroused in me as an adult. Knowing all this, and these responses,
makes me freer to act _ more of being my own person.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Being a parent, I wonder if Freud really blamed neuroses
almost entirely on the mother.
 &HT;    A: Mothers do have a tough time and a tough job. By emphasizing
the importance of early childhood experiences, Freud did put
mothers at the center of traumas and such early episodes. But
remember that in cases like little Hans, Freud focused on the
father as well. I don't see it as being hard on mothers so much as
trying to understand the nature of the conflict in front of him.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Which groups get maddest at Freud?
 &HT;    A: We've all gotten mad at Freud. But too many have treated
Freud as the last word. They expect too much of him. No one gets it
all right. Certainly Freud didn't. By focusing on so many
cornerstones of the theory of the mind, development, and
psychopathology, Freud opened the door for others to modify and
change the theory. I think that even he would embrace that view. He
did change his theories when shown contrary evidence.
 &HT;    Remember, Freud was a man of his time. He was limited by the
milieu and context in which he worked. The field was brand new
then. There wasn't much to go on. Some of Freud's blind spots
reflect that. Many times he went beyond these constraints and made
enduring insights. And that's why he's still prized, and praised.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: You've lectured on creativity?
 &HT;    A: Freud wrote a lot on the subject. His office was full of art
pieces, mostly antiquities. Freud read constantly on art and had
many artistic friends. In a paper analyzing Dostoyevski, Freud
said, ``Before the problem of the creative artist, an analyst must
alas lay down his arms. '' Freud thus recognized that he was at a
loss when analyzing creativity. But then, as on most topics, he
proceed to say a lot on the topic.
 &HT;    Freud writes beautifully. I hope the Library of Congress exhibit
and the resulting conferences will prompt more people to read what
Freud actually wrote, rather than what other people have written
about Freud. Works like ``The Psychopathology of Everyday Life,''
``The Interpretation of Dreams'' and ``Civilization and Its
Discontents'' are accessible to the average person.
 &HT;    One of my favorite essays of Freud's was ``Creative Writers and
Daydreaming. '' There he says, ``The child's best loved and most
intense occupation is with his play or games. Might we not say that
every child at play behaves like a creative writer in that he
creates a world of his own, or rather rearranges the thing of his
world in a new way which pleases him?''
 &HT;    While a child takes play seriously, Freud pointed out that he
``distinguishes it quite well from reality.'' Freud concludes:
``The creative writer does the same as the child's play. He creates
a world of fantasy which he takes very seriously _ that which he
invests with large amounts of emotion, while separating it sharply
from reality.''
 &HT;    Freud goes on in this vein of comparing play and creative
writing. It's a very lovely essay.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What makes creativity?
 &HT;    A: Many artists had an early appreciation of the sensual world.
Sometimes even an early trauma. Edgar Allen Poe's mother died when
he was quite young. Poe saw her body then in all its horror. That
description appears in some of his later stories. Magritte's mother
jumped off a bridge and drowned. You can see that sense of time
standing still and unreal nature in his work.
 &HT;    Many creative people were ill or had a lot of time to
themselves. They then became more aware of their own thinking and
fantasies _ their inner workings. For those of us less gifted, we
must find a way to bring out the creativity within us. I see
psychoanalysis as a very creative act. In that space between me and
a patient, something exceptional happens.
 &HT;    I take in a vast range of images, fantasies and feelings from an
analysis, and I respond on a similar level. It's a most exciting
and creative endeavor. I'm very privileged to be able to help
people in need, to free them from symptomatic behavior.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: How can we increase our creativity?
 &HT;    A: Give yourself time every day when you're not busy with
something else. Allow your thoughts then to flow out. When Freud
was very young, he'd place a blank sheet of paper in front of
himself every day, just to see what would come up. That was a way
to expand his creativity.
 &HT;    You can see how he was always interested in learning about
himself. This led him into the unconscious, being able to connect
with inner thoughts and emotions. That's what creativity's all
about and what psychoanalysis is about.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: You've also lectured on eating disorders. Is that an
upper-class, female adolescent disease?
 &HT;    A: Basically. It's not only teen-agers but young adult women as
well. I've treated so many that it appears to me like a societal
disease.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What causes it?
 &HT;    A: It involves a girl coming to terms with her body, with sexual
feelings, and relationships with each of her parents, particularly
with her mother. She must develop a sense of herself with
confidence _ just who she is in the world. While this sounds like
the adolescent struggle in general, some women are of a
perfectionist bent and more preoccupied with their bodies. They
have more eating disorders than others. But adolescent boys
body-build and strut around. They too fixate on their bodies.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: So why don't they have eating disorders?
 &HT;    A: The incidence of eating disorders in boys is on the rise;
however, our culture emphasizes beauty mostly in the female body.
Look at our advertisements. Girls must look a certain way, wear
makeup, watch every ounce of fat. There's a different emphasis on
the female body for the girl, and for her mother and father, which
is generally less pronounced in boys.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: You've studied women who have careers. Give us lessons
learned there.
 &HT;    A: The opportunities to be fulfilled by one's work are ever
increasing in our society. That's so wonderful. Not that women get
compensated equally for their work _ they don't yet _ but they can
fulfill such ambitions more easily nowadays. That's important. For
working mothers, it's essential to keep open all lines of
communication.
 &HT;    From professional experience I've learned that sometimes my kids
need more of me. Sometimes they need less of me. Occasionally they
don't need me at all, for a while.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Is the incidence of mothers with careers increasing?
 &HT;    A: Yes, but we should look at how the whole family functions in
that household. The real problem arises when one parent becomes so
absorbed that he or she doesn't realize what's missing in the
family.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What have you learned from Freud?
 &HT;    A: The main thing is the primacy of one's inner life. That
determines so much of how we think and behave. As an analyst, I'm
very grateful to Freud for his methodology, which is very much a
part of my way of working and helping others.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What are the main lessons of life?
 &HT;    A: Psychological health is based on the capacities to love, to
work, and to play, as Freud indicated. To be able to maintain a
balance of those abilities makes for a satisfying and fulfilling
life.

pieces, mostly antiquities. Freud read constantly on art and had
many artistic friends. In a paper analyzing Dostoyevski, Freud
said, ``Before the problem of the creative artist, an analyst must
alas lay down his arms. '' Freud thus recognized that he was at a
loss when analyzing creativity. But then, as on most topics, he
proceed to say a lot on the topic.
 &HT;    Freud writes beautifully. I hope the Library of Congress exhibit
and the resulting conferences will prompt more people to read what
Freud actually wrote, rather than what other people have written
about Freud. Works like ``The Psychopathology of Everyday Life,''
``The Interpretation of Dreams'' and ``Civilization and Its
Discontents'' are accessible to the average person.
 &HT;    One of my favorite essays of Freud's was ``Creative Writers and
Daydreaming. '' There he says, ``The child's best loved and most
intense occupation is with his play or games. Might we not say that
every child at play behaves like a creative writer in that he
creates a world of his own, or rather rearranges the thing of his
world in a new way which pleases him?''
 &HT;    While a child takes play seriously, Freud pointed out that he
``distinguishes it quite well from reality.'' Freud concludes:
``The creative writer does the same as the child's play. He creates
a world of fantasy which he takes very seriously _ that which he
invests with large amounts of emotion, while separating it sharply
from reality.''
 &HT;    Freud goes on in this vein of comparing play and creative
writing. It's a very lovely essay.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What makes creativity?
 &HT;    A: Many artists had an early appreciation of the sensual world.
Sometimes even an early trauma. Edgar Allen Poe's mother died when
he was quite young. Poe saw her body then in all its horror. That
description appears in some of his later stories. Magritte's mother
jumped off a bridge and drowned. You can see that sense of time
standing still and unreal nature in his work.
 &HT;    Many creative people were ill or had a lot of time to
themselves. They then became more aware of their own thinking and
fantasies _ their inner workings. For those of us less gifted, we
must find a way to bring out the creativity within us. I see
psychoanalysis as a very creative act. In that space between me and
a patient, something exceptional happens.
 &HT;    I take in a vast range of images, fantasies and feelings from an
analysis, and I respond on a similar level. It's a most exciting
and creative endeavor. I'm very privileged to be able to help
people in need, to free them from symptomatic behavior.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: How can we increase our creativity?
 &HT;    A: Give yourself time every day when you're not busy with
something else. Allow your thoughts then to flow out. When Freud
was very young, he'd place a blank sheet of paper in front of
himself every day, just to see what would come up. That was a way
to expand his creativity.
 &HT;    You can see how he was always interested in learning about
himself. This led him into the unconscious, being able to connect
with inner thoughts and emotions. That's what creativity's all
about and what psychoanalysis is about.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: You've also lectured on eating disorders. Is that an
upper-class, female adolescent disease?
 &HT;    A: Basically. It's not only teen-agers but young adult women as
well. I've treated so many that it appears to me like a societal
disease.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What causes it?
 &HT;    A: It involves a girl coming to terms with her body, with sexual
feelings, and relationships with each of her parents, particularly
with her mother. She must develop a sense of herself with
confidence _ just who she is in the world. While this sounds like
the adolescent struggle in general, some women are of a
perfectionist bent and more preoccupied with their bodies. They
have more eating disorders than others. But adolescent boys
body-build and strut around. They too fixate on their bodies.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: So why don't they have eating disorders?
 &HT;    A: The incidence of eating disorders in boys is on the rise;
however, our culture emphasizes beauty mostly in the female body.
Look at our advertisements. Girls must look a certain way, wear
makeup, watch every ounce of fat. There's a different emphasis on
the female body for the girl, and for her mother and father, which
is generally less pronounced in boys.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: You've studied women who have careers. Give us lessons
learned there.
 &HT;    A: The opportunities to be fulfilled by one's work are ever
increasing in our society. That's so wonderful. Not that women get
compensated equally for their work _ they don't yet _ but they can
fulfill such ambitions more easily nowadays. That's important. For
working mothers, it's essential to keep open all lines of
communication.
 &HT;    From professional experience I've learned that sometimes my kids
need more of me. Sometimes they need less of me. Occasionally they
don't need me at all, for a while.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Is the incidence of mothers with careers increasing?
 &HT;    A: Yes, but we should look at how the whole family functions in
that household. The real problem arises when one parent becomes so
absorbed that he or she doesn't realize what's missing in the
family.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What have you learned from Freud?
 &HT;    A: The main thing is the primacy of one's inner life. That
determines so much of how we think and behave. As an analyst, I'm
very grateful to Freud for his methodology, which is very much a
part of my way of working and helping others.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What are the main lessons of life?
 &HT;    A: Psychological health is based on the capacities to love, to
work, and to play, as Freud indicated. To be able to maintain a
balance of those abilities makes for a satisfying and fulfilling
life.

SMALLER BOOK CHAIN RESTYLES ITSELF TO COMPETE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JO-ANNE JOHNSTON  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUILDERLAND, N.Y. _ Lauriat's, the East Coast chain of
bookstores that filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this year,
is beginning a new chapter, the privately-held company's new chief
executive says.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trying to compete head-on with cash-rich superstores,
Lauriat's will go back to a smaller and humbler profile that
emphasizes personal service and a more streamlined inventory, says
Matthew C. Harrison, Jr., a business-turnaround specialist brought
in to head the chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had four problems,'' Harrison said in an interview Monday
at the Crossgates Mall near Albany. ``We had too many unprofitable
locations, too much overhead. We had lost focus with some stores
competing directly with superstores.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he added, the chain was undercapitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison said the chain, which operates stores under the
Lauriat's, Encore and Royal names in the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic, has now worked through many operational problems.
</P>
<P>
   First, the chain shut down 37 unprofitable stores, bringing the
number of locations to 75. And the chain fired some staff at its
Canton, Mass., headquarters, bringing employment there from 60 to
40.
</P>
<P>
   Some locations _ including the one at the Crossgates Mall _
stayed open, but needed special attention to become more viable.
</P>
<P>
   The store had too much floor space for its level of sales. So
Lauriat's downsized the store from 12,441 square feet to 8,624
square feet. The move eliminated the sales of recorded music and
relocated the children's department within the core of the store.
The store also managed to renegotiate its lease to get cheaper
rent, Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
   The trimmed-down store, selling books, calendars, stationery and
some gifts, should be more profitable and generate more sales per
square foot, Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
   The redesigned store will carry 30,000 to 40,000 titles, said
Patrick White, store manager at Crossgates. Superstore booksellers,
by contrast, carry some 150,000 titles and occupy 65,000 square
feet.

 &UR; FROM: The New York Times Magazine &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Azerbaijan is a former Soviet republic located in a disagreeable
spot just south of Russia and just north of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   It is known for nothing except oil, and the smell of that oil is
inescapable, even inside the cabin of an arthritic helicopter
desperately trying to gain altitude for a trip across the Caspian
Sea.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter, a rusting Soviet Mi-8, seems unable to move
forward, which is problematic, because we are already hovering 25
feet above the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Our destination, an offshore pumping complex known as Oily
Rocks, sits 15 miles away. Azerbaijan Airlines inherited the
helicopter from Aeroflot but did not, apparently, inherit spare
parts.
</P>
<P>
   One of these helicopters recently crashed into an oil platform,
initially prompting the president of Azerbaijan's state oil company
to turn down my request for a lift. ``It would be very embarrassing
if foreigners were killed on the way to Oily Rocks,'' Natig Aliev
told me.
</P>
<P>
   But I told Aliev I couldn't leave Azerbaijan without seeing Oily
Rocks, one of the world's largest offshore oil complexes, a place
that would certainly rank as Azerbaijan's greatest tourist
attraction if Azerbaijan had tourists. And so the accommodating
Aliev lifted the ban, for an afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   After hanging in the air for two minutes, the pilot sets the
helicopter back down. Big yellow rings of sweat stain his shirt. He
tosses off the last man to climb aboard, and returns to his seat.
This time we're off, a single 150-pound oil worker making all the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   As we gain altitude, the Apsheron Peninsula spreads out before
us. The ground below is brown and cracked dry in the heat. Crippled
oil pumps dot the landscape all the way back to the capital city,
Baku, which is built on vast reservoirs of oil and gas and is
crowded with ornate buildings that date back to the first great oil
rush here, more than a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   We fly out over the pale blue Caspian, which is spidered with
mean black slicks of oil. Which makes me think of ... caviar. Just
how safe can Caspian beluga be, if the sturgeon swim in light
crude?
</P>
<P>
   And then, there it is: Oily Rocks, a Stalinist fabulation of
broken-down oil platforms and causeways that stretch past the
horizon. Crosshatched streets, 125 miles of them, rest on pylons
sunk into the seabed.
</P>
<P>
   We touch down on a weedy landing pad and are met by a school bus
that will carry us down the causeways that link one platform to
another. The state oil company has sent a senior executive, Baba
Musayev, to be my official minder. He is a man of about 50,
rough-hewed, with rotting teeth and arms tanned the color of plums.
There is no place like Oily Rocks in the entire world, he says, and
this is true: In the West, oil platforms are built freestanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in the Soviet Union,'' Musayev says, ``steel was cheap and
there was a lot of it, so the Soviet mentality said that everything
should be linked by road.''
</P>
<P>
   Oily Rocks is crumbling. Truck-size chunks of it are falling
into the sea, and everything is orange with rust. One-third of the
600 wells are inoperative, and miles and miles of causeway have
broken apart.
</P>
<P>
   The Caspian is rising, and water now laps the second stories of
many buildings, even those that house oil workers. These
eight-story apartment buildings are a remarkable sight. Only the
Soviet Union could build slum housing in the middle of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized that we couldn't sustain this when the market
economy came along,'' Musayev tells me, curling his lip when he
says ``market economy.''
</P>
<P>
   We are eating lunch in the cafeteria, fresh greens, white cheese
and boiled chicken, served by dour, henna-haired women. A
photograph of Azerbaijan's president, Heydar Aliyev, watches us
from the wall. It is impossible to avoid Aliyev's image _ or his
influence _ anywhere in Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Capitalism is only interested in revenue, not in
engineering,'' Musayev continues. And yet he wants to join the
market economy he so distrusts. He has already applied for jobs
with four Western oil companies. He earns $80 a month, and knows
that even drivers for Amoco and Unocal make three or four times
that amount.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans are already aboard Oily Rocks, in a limited way.
We drive past a yellow-painted facility that shines in the
hammering sun. It is a gas-compression facility just built by
Pennzoil. ``No smoking around here,'' Musayev says, tossing his
cigarette. ``American rules.''
</P>
<P>
   American rules may soon apply to all of Oily Rocks. The complex,
like everything in Azerbaijan, is for sale. The government is
looking for a partner, a Western oil company, that will modernize
this mess. It will surely find one, because Baku is overflowing
with oilmen. The city stands at the center of the first great oil
rush of the 21st century, an oil rush of great consequence for
Washington and Moscow, and for a dozen capitals in between.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars who believe that history ended with the collapse of
communism should visit Baku, because in Baku, nothing is settled.
Who could predict the future of a country that many in Moscow _
volatile, feverish Moscow _ believe shouldn't be a country at all,
but instead a province of a reanimated Russian empire?
</P>
<P>
   In Teheran, Azerbaijan is seen as an unforgivable contradiction:
a secular Shiite state, a country ripe for Islamization. In 10
years' time, Azerbaijan could be an Islamic state, or a
neo-Communist state, or a capitalist democracy, or a capitalist
autocracy, or even part of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Azerbaijan gained its freedom in 1991, but soon lost 15 percent
of its territory to Armenia, which humiliated it in a vicious war.
Azerbaijanis were killing each other too; the country seemed
ungovernable, a failed-state-in-the-making of warlords and
gangsters.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1993, Aliyev came back to Baku. He was the former
Communist Party boss of Azerbaijan who had gone into self-imposed
rural exile, but returned to Baku and exploited the chaos there.
His bloodless coup brought a temporary stability.
</P>
<P>
   He also brought with him an idea that ensured his country's
independence. There has always been oil in Azerbaijan. Centuries
ago, the Zoroastrians built their fire temples in the hills of
Baku, worshiping the flames that burst from the gas-filled earth.
More than 100 years ago, the Nobel brothers and the Rothschilds
built fortunes on Baku oil. Then the Soviets came, and closed off
Azerbaijan's oil reserves to the West.
</P>
<P>
   It took an ex-KGB general and former Politburo member to open
them up again. For Aliyev, oil wasn't only a commodity; it was
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oil is our strategy, it is our defense, it is our
independence,'' Aliyev's foreign-policy adviser, Vafa Gulizade,
told me. ``Iran is dreaming dreams of Azerbaijan, and if the
Russians were strong, they would colonize Azerbaijan. But they
can't because Aliyev invited the whole world in to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1994, the world's major oil companies, with Aliyev's
encouragement, were busy developing Azerbaijan's neglected oil
wealth. Aliyev's theory was that flag follows trade, and the theory
is proving correct. Aliyev has become Washington's man, and
Azerbaijan's oil has become an issue of great strategic importance
for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Azerbaijan sits atop as much as 20 billion barrels of oil, which
makes its reserves smaller than Kuwait's but about the same size as
Nigeria's, from which the United States imports nearly 5 percent of
its oil. Azerbaijan may also become the conduit for even more oil
and natural gas that will flow from Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan, on
the east side of the Caspian.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the Caspian region could be the source of as much as
200 billion barrels of oil. For America, the stakes are enormous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Caspian region will hopefully save us from total
dependence on Middle East oil,'' says Bill Richardson, the
secretary of energy and the administration's point man on the
Caspian oil rush. For the oil companies, the opening of the Caspian
means access to tens of billions of dollars of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Western companies have signed oil contracts totaling
$40 billion in Azerbaijan. More than 1,000 American oilmen are
making Baku their base, part of an expatriate community numbering
at least 4,000. Profits at this early stage, though, are still
theoretical, and some companies are having a lousy time of it. A
consortium including Pennzoil, for instance, recently spent a great
deal of money drilling in the Caspian and came up with no oil.
</P>
<P>
   Aliyev has ladled out much of his oil already, entering his
state company into 12 development projects with foreign oil
companies, but there is still plenty of oil left to be found. In
the race to capture it, the Americans hold the early lead, with the
British close behind and the French, Germans, Norwegians, Japanese
and Italians all trailing. Even the Russian oil company Lukoil has
a presence.
</P>
<P>
   Baku is a United Nations of oil, and the jockeying for the most
lucrative oil fields is intense. But no more intense than the
jockeying between Russia and America, which find themselves in a
subterranean and unacknowledged war for primacy in an especially
dangerous corner of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have difficulty convincing the Russians that we're not
trying to edge them out,'' Richardson says. ``They see the area as
their sovereign, virgin territory.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason the Americans might have difficulty convincing the
Russians that they're not being edged out is because they are being
edged out. Aliyev has already cut favorable deals with American oil
companies at the expense of Russian ones. Which is why the Russians
don't like it when the Americans start talking about pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   The next best thing to controlling the source of the oil is
controlling its flow. Some of Azerbaijan's oil already flows north
to Russia through a small pipeline. Another small pipeline is being
built to Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   But an international consortium of oil companies is scheduled to
recommend a route for a main export pipeline in October that could
eventually move one million barrels of oil daily.
</P>
<P>
   Russia wants the pipeline to run through its territory but the
United States wants it to run west, through Georgia and into
Turkey, a NATO ally. Iran too would like to have a pipeline, but
that won't happen as long as the United States says it won't
happen.
</P>
<P>
   The competition for all this oil means that Baku is filled with
intrigue and the fear of instability. Last month, Aliyev's police
and opposition demonstrators fought street skirmishes in advance of
the mid-October national election.
</P>
<P>
   Aliyev has been the object of three, or four, or five
assassination attempts in the last several years (his intelligence
chief counted six for me, though two sounded more like wishful
thinking than executable plots), and his ally to the west,
Georgia's Eduard Shevardnadze, is also a semiregular target of
assassins.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed throughout the Caucasus that the assassins are
dispatched by Russian nationalists who have not accepted the death
of their empire. Russia's current meltdown has only heightened the
fear in Baku and Tbilisi, Georgia's capital, that Russian
hard-liners will be trying even more enthusiastically to pull
Azerbaijan and Georgia back into Moscow's orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Assassins are only occasional visitors to Baku, but the city is
rampant with ham-handed Russian spies, as well as Turkish
gangsters, Chechen revolutionaries, American diplomats, Iranian
terrorists and financial speculators of various nationalities,
drawn to Baku because it is a frontier of global capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Before I left for Baku, I was inundated with propaganda from the
oil companies and from Azerbaijan's lobbyists in Washington,
assuring me that Azerbaijan is a lighthouse of stability, a
pro-American redoubt and a place ready to do business in the
community of Western nations. Most of all, they said, it is a place
whose shining future, under the leadership of Aliyev, is assured.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not that's true, Baku is a fine place to watch the
future of capitalism unfold. The Caspian oil rush is a reminder
that not all commerce in the future will be carried out
antiseptically over the Internet, that the ethereal talk of
globalization means little to men who have to drill for oil and
then physically move that oil across dangerous territory.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the old verities apply. At least in this corner of the
globe, 21st-century capitalism looks very much like 19th-century
capitalism. Baku is a city of the bribe and the shakedown, of
florid corruption and baroque greed.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of high-tech capitalism _ in this place America hopes
will help solve its Persian Gulf oil problem _ the fragility of the
oil business is apparent. Success depends on the cooperation, or at
least the acquiescence, of Russians and Chechens, Iranians and
Armenians, as well as the fortunes of Azerbaijani politics.
</P>
<P>
   The future may be not nearly as hopeful as Aliyev believes it
will be, and not nearly as secure as the oil companies _ and
Washington _ need it to be.

 By MARGARET TALBOT  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    In October the Library of Congress opens the doors of its Thomas
Jefferson Building for the largest exhibit ever assembled on the
life and work of Sigmund Freud.
 &HT;    If the Library's estimates are correct, by the time the show
closes on Jan. 16, more than a quarter million people will have
inspected Freud's handwritten case notes on immortal patients such
as the Rat Man, the famous letter to his friend Wilhelm Fliess in
which Freud renounces the so-called seduction theory and dozens of
other manuscripts and first editions from the library's vast
collection of Freudiana.
 &HT;    Visitors will see the actual chair Dr. Freud used in his
examining room, the actual kilim rug that draped the iconic couch,
his actual spectacles and a phalanx of the antiquities Freud
collected and arrayed with fetishistic precision on his desk.
 &HT;    What makes this exhibit remarkable, however, is not so much the
objects in it as the fact that it is happening at all. In the
jagged cardiogram that is the history of Freud's reputation, 1998
is not, after all, a peak. Managed care has been notoriously
inhospitable to long-term psychotherapy and notoriously hospitable
to the quicker, cheaper fixes of behavior mod and Prozac.
 &HT;    The steady drip-drip of Freud criticism over the past decade _
attacks on his personal character, his originality, his therapeutic
models and his scientific status _ has corroded the cultural
prestige psychoanalysis once enjoyed among American intellectuals.
 &HT;    Moreover, the Freud show could just as easily have been doomed
by the increasingly contentious politics of museum curatorship as
by the anti-Freudian zeitgeist _ and for a time it looked as if it
would be.
 &HT;    Museums _ especially history museums _ are now subject, in
unprecedented degree, to the scrutiny and pressure tactics of
interest groups, many of which insist on being heard at the
earliest planning stages of a show and, more and more successfully,
on getting their point of view incorporated into exhibits.
 &HT;    Witness the fate of the Enola Gay exhibit at the Smithsonian's
National Air and Space museum, drastically altered after veterans
complained that it portrayed the Japanese as victims and failed to
credit the bombing of Hiroshima with ending the war.
 &HT;    Or the exhibit of 19th- and 20th-century photographs called
``Back of the Big House: The Cultural Landscape of the
Plantation,'' scheduled by the Library of Congress to open two
years ago but canceled entirely after a group of African-American
library staff members complained that the images it contained _ of
slaves and slave quarters _ were offensive.
 &HT;    Or the recent Smithsonian exhibit on the history of sweatshops,
which drew indignant protests from clothing industry lobbyists.
They didn't like the fact that the mock-up of a sweatshop featured
in the show happened to be one that made not cigars or trinkets but
apparel. The dust-up over ``Sigmund Freud: Conflict and Culture''
came just after the Enola Gay and ``Big House'' protests, and
seemed to presage a similar end.
 &HT;    In the summer of 1995, about a year after the library appointed
a guest curator and scheduled the exhibit, an independent
researcher and irrepressible Freud skeptic named Peter Swales
rallied about 50 other scholars, most of whom had published work
critical of Freud, to sign a petition. The show's planning
committee, the petitioners complained, was stacked with
psychoanalytic apologists and its goal, as one of the signatories
put it in an interview, was simply ``to polish up the tarnished
image of a business'' _ psychoanalysis _ ``that's heading into
Chapter 11.''
 &HT;    The petition said nothing about canceling or even postponing the
exhibit. But in December of that year, when the library suddenly
announced that it was delaying the show indefinitely, the decision
was widely perceived as a capitulation to the petitioners and to
the threat of controversy. The library's own explanation _ that it
had run short of funds _ convinced virtually no one writing about
the story at the time.
 &HT;    ``Underlying the attempt to block the Freud exhibit was a
particularly dangerous notion: that an institution owned by the
government should avoid doing anything controversial,'' wrote the
New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis. In the pages of The New
Republic, the sociologist Todd Gitlin declared that, just as it had
in the case of the ``Back of the Big House'' show, the library had
``chosen suppression over exhibition, silencing over debate.''
 &HT;    It now looks as if the library did delay the exhibit primarily
for financial reasons _ it was $350,000 shy of the $900,000 budget
projected for the exhibit, and this was not the first or last time
that it had postponed shows for lack of funds.
 &HT;    Moreover, the Freud petitioners had not mobilized the support of
members of Congress, as the Enola Gay protesters had, nor did their
objections pivot on racial sensitivities, patriotism or the kind of
populist, defense-of-decency politics that drove the disputes over
art-museum shows _ such as the one devoted to Robert Mapplethorpe's
photographs. For these reasons, the library could afford not to
yield to them.
 &HT;    Oddly enough, it was the assumption that it was caving in to
pressure that allowed the library to raise the extra money it
needed for the show. Members of the American Psychoanalytic
Association organized a letter-writing campaign. Subsequently, the
Discovery Channel made a gift of $125,000 and the Jewish Museum in
New York signed on as a new venue to which the exhibit would
travel. A number of individuals made small, unsolicited donations,
often tucked into letters decrying Freud-bashing or censorship or
both.
 &HT;    And yet it will be difficult for anyone who sees ``Freud'' and
who remembers the squall over it to judge it without some of the
criteria of the anti-Freudians in mind. Welcome to the era of
preemptive-strike criticism.
 &HT;    Three years ago, when library officials chose the Freud show's
guest curator, they selected, rather cannily, a young cultural
historian named Michael S. Roth. Roth, who was then at the
Claremont Graduate School and is now at the Getty Research
Institute in Los Angeles, was only 38 at the time.
 &HT;    And despite the fact that he had written a book called
``Psycho-Analysis as History: Negation and Freedom in Freud,''
Freudian theory wasn't really his specialty or obsession _ he had
published just as much about Hegel. His intellectual preoccupation
is with memory (``how people make sense of the past and what
happens when they can't or won't,'' as he puts it), which might be
thought of as a Freudian theme, but which clearly isn't exclusively
one.
 &HT;    For a time it seemed that even the petitioners were willing to
see Roth as a well-meaning sort, at worst a dupe of the older and
more orthodox members of the show's planning committee _ the
historian Peter Gay and the analyst Harold Blum, for instance.
 &HT;    ``It seems so odd to talk of a significant cultural figure in
terms of he's great or he's bad,'' Roth told me in an interview one
rainy evening this past summer. ``Historians don't talk that way.
It's almost hubris to talk that way.''
 &HT;    Yet in the saga of this exhibit, there was Roth, with his wry,
agnostic, historian's turn of mind, called upon to negotiate with
Freud critics for whom there was really only one salient question:
Was Freud right? and one answer: No.
 &HT;    ``It was so strange. I was used to the atmosphere of a small
college,'' Roth said, shaking his head. ``And then this petition
came up and the postponing of the show and all the press coverage
of it, and suddenly friends were calling me from France saying, 'My
God, Michael, we hear you're being burned in effigy over there.'''
 &HT;    The Library of Congress owns the pre-eminent Freud collection in
the world, but much of the material in it had arrived with
restrictions imposed by the organization that had assembled it, the
Sigmund Freud Archives.
 &HT;    In recent years, however, the library had engineered a
compromise with the archives' director, Blum, to make some sealed
papers available if the names of patients were blacked out by
reviewers chosen by the archives. In the year 2000, almost all of
the previously restricted material was at last due to be opened
anyway.
 &HT;    The exhibit, then, was to be for the collection a sort of early
and symbolic ``coming-out party,'' as the Librarian of Congress,
James Billington, took to calling it.
 &HT;    Then Swales entered the picture. Among the loose assembly of
Freud skeptics, Swales is the anti-Freudians' anti-Freudian. This
is not only because of his research over the last 25 years,
revealing the true identities of several early patients of Freud's
who had been known only by their pseudonyms, but because of his
appetite for provocation.
 &HT;    Swales is 50 now but still something of an enfant terrible. He
grew up in rural Wales, ran away from high school and home at 17
and spent much of his early career toiling in the British pop
industry, mainly as a personal assistant to the Rolling Stones.
Freud studies was something Swales fell into in the early '70s,
while working in New York with Stonehill Publishing, which brought
out the first thorough study of Freud's early infatuation with
cocaine.
 &HT;    In the summer of 1995, when Swales began circulating a letter of
protest about the library's Freud exhibition, it didn't take him
long to collect nearly 50 names. Some of them were obvious choices
_ for example, Frederick Crews, the literary critic turned
Freud-loathing polemicist who holds Freud responsible for
everything from ``egocentric and prurient encouragement to look for
low motives in everyone'' to the excesses of the recovered-memory
movement.
 &HT;    Gloria Steinem, a Freud disser from way back, added a glint of
celebrity to the campaign. And some of the signatories were rather
surprising _ the writer and neurologist Oliver Sacks, for one, who
had never made common cause with the anti-Freudians. (Sacks later
distanced himself from the affair, telling Psychiatric News that
``No one who knows me could imagine me as an anti-Freudian.'')
 &HT;    Apart from its rather mild language, the letter made one odd
request _ namely, that a man named Henry Cohen, an attorney at the
Congressional Research Service who was friendly with some of the
petitioners, sit in on committee meetings ``to keep all of us
apprised of the deliberations and developments.''
 &HT;    Roth would not have it: ``I remember being really disturbed by
the idea that we would have this guy who was not a Freud scholar
and who happened to be a lawyer monitoring us,'' he says.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, in the fall of 1995, Roth made a number of
overtures to the petitioners. He felt they deserved a serious
response and he clearly hated the idea of being construed as a
propagandist.
 &HT;    In October, he sent the petitioners each a ``Dear Scholar''
letter in which he said that they had ``alerted me to the dangers
that the exhibit might unwittingly contain a partisan defense of
Freud, or that we might not have paid sufficient attention to the
recent historical and philosophical critiques of psychoanalysis.''
 &HT;    That fall (and indeed over the next two years), Roth grappled
with the question of how an exhibit whose fundamental purpose was
to showcase manuscripts in Freud's own hand and to explicate for
the widest possible audience the ideas they contained could, at the
same time, do justice to the contemporary critique of Freud.
 &HT;    ``Some people wanted an exhibit that said that Freud was wrong,
that he was a bad person, that, as one critic put it, we should
have the moral courage to condemn him,'' Roth says. ``Well, that's
just not what this particular show is about.''
 &HT;    It turns out that in the end, some of the critics are
represented in a series of quotes that wrap around the display
panels and amplify or refute the arguments of the manuscripts
below. They are a little too sound-bite-y, though, to convey much
sense of their authors' objections.
 &HT;    And they are surrounded by quotes from earlier critics _
Wittgenstein, Nabokov, Germaine Greer _ which tend to make the
contemporaries seem like merely the latest and tinniest voices in a
long and clamorous parade of Freud detractors. Freud has always
generated resentment, this cacophony of commentary seems to say,
and yet, look: He's still with us.
 &HT;    For a while, Roth wanted to end the show with a section called
``Contested Legacies,'' which would have highlighted the continuing
debate over Freudian theory. He liked the idea of introducing this
section with ``two very simple, direct questions about
psychoanalysis: Is it true? and Does it work?''
 &HT;    But the other advisers worried that they were in danger of
accentuating the conflict over Freud at the expense of what they
saw as their first duty: setting out his ideas. Besides, they
concluded, the average museumgoer might well be alienated by an
exhibit that seemed preoccupied with what was essentially a debate
among scholars.
 &HT;    Now what viewers will see near the end of the exhibit, bracketed
by photos of Nazi book-burnings and of Freud's four sisters who
perished in concentration camps, are the manuscripts of ``A Word
about Anti-Semitism,'' ``Why War?'' and ``Civilization and its
Discontents.''
 &HT;    It is curious that the Freud show protests _ and all the new
museum protests _ seem to share the notion, or fear, that every
museumgoer will interpret an exhibit in exactly the same way and
indeed, exactly as its planners intended.
 &HT;    ``The premise behind all these protests,'' says Steven Conn, a
museum historian at Ohio State University, ``is that all museum
exhibits come heavily laden with political and interpretive baggage
_ and there is only one way to read them. The audience is
essentially a passive receptacle.''
 &HT;    But why should that be so? ``No one thinks of texts that way
anymore,'' as Conn points out. ``No one would argue that there is
only one way to read 'Hamlet.'''
 &HT;    On the one hand, the interest groups that protest museum shows
take a skeptical, post-modern view of exhibits. They maintain that
neutrality and objectivity are flimsy veils for the inescapably
ideological agendas of curators. And on the other hand, they take a
rather old-fashioned, not to say condescending, view of the
audience for those exhibits: They will think what they are being
told what to think.
 &HT;    The question is: Why should the rest of us accept that premise?

 &HT;    
 By DIANE CARDWELL  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Early on in Jonathan Demme's movie ``Beloved,'' a character
named Paul D (Danny Glover) literally walks a gantlet of memories,
moving slowly down a hallway while bloody images of the past are
flashed before him, the work of an invisible and extremely hostile
young ghost.
 &HT;    He shields his eyes _ who wouldn't? _ trying not to look but
having to as he moves toward a room free of these visions.
 &HT;    It's an unsettling sequence, certainly, but one that evokes the
familiar: He could just as easily be a viewer cringing from any one
of a number of recent and soon-to-be released movies and television
shows that traffic in graphic violence, difficult sex and plain old
nastiness.
 &HT;    Things on-screen have been getting increasingly explicit for
years now, but what is striking about these new works is their
hyperrealism: They are all serious creative undertakings intended
to slam home a particular reality, as opposed to offering up
gross-outs merely to shock or entertain, as in ``Urban Legends'' or
``Very Bad Things.''
 &HT;    Stylistically diverse and divergent in scale, they are united in
their use of hard-to-watch images in the service of a larger social
or political message.
 &HT;    Take, for example, ``American History X,'' which opens this
month and tells the story of Derek Vineyard (Edward Norton), a
racist skinhead consumed by virulent hatred, and the younger
brother (Edward Furlong) who idolizes him. Norton recently told a
reporter from George magazine that he and the creative team
realized they ``had the potential to touch the nerve of a very
potent reality in contemporary American life ...'' and that the
inspiration for a few of the movie's more horrific scenes _ a
murder, a rampage in a grocery store _ ``was all material straight
out of news clippings.''
 &HT;    The heart of the movie's viscera is perhaps the death by curbing
of a young black man at Vineyard's hands _ well, foot, to be
precise. (Curbing, a particularly vicious practice in which a
victim's open mouth is placed on a curb and the head is stomped,
breaking at least the jaw if not the neck, is known among skinheads
and other assorted sociopaths.)
 &HT;    Similarly, Oprah Winfrey, who co-produced and stars in
``Beloved,'' has said that she ``wanted to do with a movie what
Toni Morrison had done with a book. She allowed us to see what
slavery felt like and ... allowed you to go into the interior of a
person's spirit, to understand what slavery did to their soul.''
 &HT;    In one sequence, as Sethe (Winfrey) narrates the disturbing
events of the night she escaped a plantation, a pastiche of
bondage, sexual brutality and punishment plays out in grainy,
washed-out color.
 &HT;    Even Steven Spielberg, an emotionally but not visually
promiscuous filmmaker, delved headlong into gory territory with his
famously explicit combat scenes in ``Saving Private Ryan,''
recreating the mayhem of battle so effectively that his movie
becomes an antiwar message.
 &HT;    But the trend isn't limited to violence or film. Todd Solondz's
``Happiness'' depicts the intense dysfunction that afflicts
relationships, showcasing not only a faintly sympathetic pedophile
but also a good deal of masturbation and, jarringly, its aftermath.
 &HT;    On television there's the HBO series ``Oz,'' a stylish drama
that examines the social and spiritual bankruptcy of men in prison
and the lives that led them there. Last year's final episode
featured gruesome revenge for a season's worth of sexual slavery,
and this season opened with an imprisoned child abuser being nailed
to the floor by fellow inmates. (Significantly, both horrors took
place in the gym, that everyday temple of masculinity, here gone
haywire.)
 &HT;    It has often been the justification for this sort of show-me
culture that the benefits of seeing the truth far outweigh its
unpleasantness, that we cannot know (and therefore be moved to
eradicate) the ugliness of life without being subjected to it (an
argument that oddly puts Kenneth Starr and gangsta rappers in the
same camp as reporters of reality).
 &HT;    And as a society we seem to have a taste for it. Witness the
proliferation of documentary programming on television _ shows such
as ``Cops'' or ``Justice Files,'' which take you into the world of
crime, or even ``The Operation,'' which takes you inside the human
body. The net effect has been to ratchet up our tolerance for what
we can watch. Now for a film to distinguish itself as portraying a
real pathology, it has to go even further.
 &HT;    There's nothing inherently wrong with using harsh images to
shock audiences out of their complacency, to dramatize the ways in
which our society has gone around the bend. Indeed, real-life
hideousness _ juvenile crime, family abuse, racial hatred,
inner-city despair _ worsens every day. The problem is that there
seems to be no end on the horizon; we are progressing toward a
point where nothing will be left unseen.
 &HT;    And when everything is laid bare, as viewers we will have no way
to engage, no way to use our own experiences and ideas to interpret
what we take in. This, it seems, robs art of its most animating
function: the exchange of imagination between creator and consumer.
 &HT;    In fact, one reason that the images in ``Beloved'' are powerful
is precisely because they don't last too long; they insinuate
themselves on the psyche, leaving an imprint that lingers and
recurs. Though there is much to admire in fictions such as
``American History X'' and ``Oz,'' they ultimately suffer from a
fascination with their own authenticity, from their obsessive need
to keep it realer than real.
 &HT;    And the more the urge to show is indulged, the more we'll all be
like Paul D, turning one squinty eye to the visions before us as we
try to endure them and reach safer ground.

 &HT;    
 By SARAH KERR  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Barbara Kingsolver has been hospitable beyond the call of duty
ever since I accidentally arrived early at her house in Tucson and
surprised her padding barefoot in a sundress and sipping a beer.
 &HT;    She's been solicitous about jet lag. She has gone out into her
woolly desert garden, plucked giant cucumbers and bright purple
eggplants and cooked up a delicious meal.
 &HT;    But when I ask about her childhood, she says, ``I'm not crazy
about myself,'' and emits a low, edgy chuckle.
 &HT;    Kingsolver, you see, doesn't want to be just another
late-20th-century image for sale. She's no performer, and the
history of her psyche is not in the public domain.
 &HT;    When I suggest that Dickens, Twain and Wilde all happily
embraced fame, she counters: ``Well, they weren't raising kids. And
Oscar Wilde was never shoved onto the noontime news in Denver and a
mike clipped to his lapel and asked, 'In 58 seconds, because that's
what we have, what did you mean when you wrote ``The Importance of
Being Earnest?'' '
 &HT;    What she does want is to be an engaged writer, a responsible
citizen, a positive moral force. Her novels have always been
indirectly political.
 &HT;    ``The Bean Trees,'' ``Animal Dreams'' and ``Pigs in Heaven''
touched, respectively, on the Sanctuary movement to shelter Central
American refugees in Tucson; on idealistic young Americans who went
to work with the Sandinista government and on laws concerning the
adoption of Indian children. But her latest novel moves politics to
the front burner.
 &HT;    ``The Poisonwood Bible'' is set in the Congo in the late 1950s
and early 1960s, just as that republic is winning independence from
Belgium. The novel is Kingsolver's first in five years, and it is a
quantum-leap breakthrough.
 &HT;    Where her earlier books tended to be simple and sweet, the new
one is learned, tragicomic and sprawling. It is also more truly the
work of an activist _ critical, especially, of American involvement
in the assassination of Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba and the
installation of the dictator Mobutu.
 &HT;    Not that the politics are always right there on the surface:
``If I were to write a nonfiction book about the brief blossoming
and destruction of the independence of the Congo, and what the CIA
had to do with it, then probably all 85 people who are interested
in the subject would read it. Instead I can write a novel that's
ostensibly about family and culture and an exotic locale. And it's
entertaining, I hope.''
 &HT;    It's not your typical literary chat, this frank admission by
Kingsolver that she deliberately set out to hook people with a good
story, then smuggled in a political lesson. But Kingsolver is
pretty much indifferent to your typical literary chat.
 &HT;    Shy she may be, but she's also an iconoclast. She believes that
much of America's literary elite (``the gatekeepers, the inner
circle,'' she calls them, almost certainly overestimating their
influence) is squeamish and snobby. She believes critics made a
fatal mistake in the 1950s by caving in to McCarthyism and allowing
a gulf to divide art from politics. With some justification, she
points to great writers from George Bernard Shaw to Solzhenitsyn
who weren't afraid to mix literature and advocacy.
 &HT;    And when Kingsolver believes something, she tends to act on it.
With the advance from ``The Poisonwood Bible'' (estimated at close
to $1 million), she is endowing a new literary prize, the
Bellwether, which will award $25,000 to the writer of an
unpublished novel that addresses issues of ``social change.''
 &HT;    The prize, which will be handed out in the spring (on May Day,
to be exact), is, for all its idealism, also stunningly pragmatic _
and this is key to understanding Kingsolver. The typical literary
award entails a backbreaking amount of slogging through
manuscripts, but Kingsolver streamlined the process by asking 25
literary agents to submit one entry each.
 &HT;    Another shrewd idea: She'll team up each year with a different
publisher, who will guarantee a minimum run of 10,000 copies. So
the Bellwether winner won't be just another ``worthy'' book; it
will be a worthy book with a publisher behind it.
 &HT;    ``As much as she wants to encourage younger writers, she wants
publishers scrambling to publish these books,'' Frances Goldin,
Kingsolver's longtime agent, says of her client's aspirations. In
short, Kingsolver wants to change the world _ her way. She wants to
bring politics back into literature. She wants progress, not a chic
cocktail-party discussion of progress.
 &HT;    But she's realistic about what she can do, and careful not to
overextend. Hers is a pared-down radicalism _ a radicalism of
lowered expectations, aware of its limits and selectively
strategic. Kingsolver may object to the commodification of American
life. But in her own way, she's as wily as an entrepreneur.
 &HT;    In private, she considers herself just an average ``working
mom.'' And indeed, dinner with Kingsolver and her husband, Steven
Hopp, an ornithologist, is the same stop-and-go chaos as dinner in
any household with a toddler.
 &HT;    Two-year-old Lily hasn't been fed since lunch and is gearing up
for a protest. Barbara and Steven desperately hunt for the special
``sippy cup'' she likes to drink from, but it's too late. Lily
frets. She starts to cry. And while Lily is unhappy, Kingsolver is
unable to focus on anything else.
 &HT;    In several essays, Kingsolver has agonized about what lessons to
teach her daughters. (Besides Lily, there is Camille, who is 11 and
the child of a previous marriage.) Kingsolver tells me she worries
constantly about her performance as a mother. In fact, she seems to
approach motherhood with such specific ideas _ frequent walks in
the woods to learn about nature; don't outlaw TV but set an example
by curling up on the couch with a good book _ that you wonder if
she is trying to replicate her experience as a little girl or make
up for shortcomings.
 &HT;    For instance: Camille has been allotted a space in the garden
behind the house, where she's expected to grow a crop. When Lily's
a little older, she'll get one too. This, it turns out, was exactly
the practice in a certain household in Carlisle, Ky., the backwater
``one valley away from Appalachia'' where Kingsolver grew up.
 &HT;    Kingsolver sounds nervous when talking about her parents, who
are still alive _ admiring but defensive. She tells me that her
father was a physician who could have made a pile of money
practicing in the city but stayed behind to deliver babies to women
in need; her mother was a homemaker with exceptional strength of
character.
 &HT;    She speaks with gratitude about the sense of responsibility they
instilled in her, the way they gently guided her toward an
appreciation of nature and books. But as soon as she can change the
subject, she does, moving toward some general statement about the
world.
 &HT;    ``My parents always gave me to know I could make a difference _
and I'd better make one.'' Pause, then the move-out: ``In some
sense, I realize it's a luxury to feel the way I do. I know there
are plenty of people who are completely overwhelmed just by
survival.''
 &HT;    It is impossible to know whether Kingsolver is (quite
understandably) trying to protect her parents' feelings or whether
her own feelings about her childhood are simply unresolved. What's
true is that in her fiction, the subject of parents is a loaded
one.
 &HT;    ``Animal Dreams'' told the story of a young woman who feels like
an outsider in her small home town and who struggles in a
relationship with her distant father _ like Kingsolver's own, a
physician.
 &HT;    The parental issue becomes even more awkward when you consider
``The Poisonwood Bible.'' The new novel is told in the voice of
five females _ the wife and four daughters of a Christian
missionary who moves his family to the Congo and sacrifices their
health and safety in order to further his arrogant dream of
``civilizing'' Africans.
 &HT;    The year 1963 happens to be the same one when the Kingsolver
family moved to the Congo. Kingsolver seems to have relatively
carefree memories of her time there _ a child's memories of
learning songs in a new language and playing in a strange, lush
forest.
 &HT;    ``The Congo sent an electric shock through my brain. It was so
interesting to live in a place with no electricity, no radio, no
running water, no plumbing. There were just worlds of people living
perfectly satisfying lives, without needing some of the stuff I'd
assumed was necessary. I looked around and thought: 'Wow! I don't
know the half of it.'''
 &HT;    Kingsolver is infuriated when readers and journalists ask her to
elaborate on the parallels between her novels and her life.
 &HT;    ``She gets very upset when she has to do interviews,'' Frances
Goldin says. ``She's fearful of saying something about her family
that will upset them. People are sometimes not sensitive. They're
going to ask her why her father went to Africa, but it's got
nothing to do with her family. They conclude it must be
autobiographical, and she can't get them off their insistence.''
Goldin sounds protective, and upset. ``She's the most polite person
I've ever met. She lives her life by her principles. She gives so
much back. So I hate to see her wounded.''
 &HT;    Still, the fact remains that the fraught theme of most of her
fiction is the same theme that comes up when she talks about her
childhood. Kingsolver assumes that people want to draw vulgar
diagrams of her work _ to find out what real person X and Y
represent.
 &HT;    But she may be underestimating readers who don't want to pry (or
vilify her parents, who sound as if they were extraordinarily
loving and conscientious) so much as they want to know more about
her experience of responsibility: its possibility for good, its
burdens, its danger when carried too far.
 &HT;    There's a palpable fragility about Kingsolver. A mistrust, even.
When we go to a friendly local restaurant, she requests a booth
seat, back against the wall, so as not to be exposed to the rest of
the room.
 &HT;    As we drive out of Tucson one afternoon, across a parched plain
studded with gnarly mesquite, she points out dozens of ostentatious
mansions that rich escapees from California are building high in
the hills. Why would anyone want to live there, she wonders,
exposed for all the world to see? Her own sleek, ecologically
responsible adobe ranch house is built into the side of a hill
outside of Tucson, screened by the trees from the scrutiny of
passers-by.
 &HT;    When she bought it three years ago, Kingsolver was daunted by
its magazine-ready glamour, so with her typical _ modesty?
practical-mindedness? guilt? _ she roughed it up a little to make
it more homey.
 &HT;    She gets much, much happier when the conversation moves from her
personal life to her political views. They seem quite deeply felt,
if occasionally dewy-eyed. She thinks the United States could learn
a thing or two from Denmark's generous social programs. She was
enraged this summer when America bombed the Sudan. She believes
that Mumia Abu Jamal, a former radio journalist and black activist
convicted of killing a policeman in Philadelphia, is being held as
a political prisoner.
 &HT;    (She sent Abu Jamal a draft of ``The Poisonwood Bible,'' and he
wrote back with extensive, helpful comments ``from the point of
view of an African-American,'' she tells me.)
 &HT;    Her capacity for outrage and hope makes me nostalgic for the
thrill I felt as a college freshman discovering the outside world _
and it turns out this is precisely the giddy age at which many of
Kingsolver's views took shape.
 &HT;    In the early 70's she entered DePauw University. She had zoomed
through high school, studying Kant and Hume for a correspondence
course in philosophy, but she had yet to learn the judgmental pop
language of American youth. The adjustment was painful. ``It was
very scary when I first got there, because there were all these
kids who looked alike and they had these clothes and these hairdos.
There was a veneer of knowing things before you know them that I
didn't have.''
 &HT;    She gradually lost her Southern accent because ``they'd hear me
say 'Hi' and they'd think how cute it was that I was wearing shoes
and it wasn't even Sunday.''
 &HT;    Soon she found a comfortable role as a campus activist, reading
``The Feminine Mystique'' (``a book that changed my life'') and
Karl Marx (``the scales fell from my eyes'') and joining sit-ins in
front of the ROTC building. This was the tail end of the Nixon era,
remember.
 &HT;    Before she went to DePauw, Kingsolver says all she knew about
Vietnam was that Kentucky boys were coming home in body bags.
``When I got to college, bang, I saw the rest of the story. Like
everything else in the world, it was rich people somehow protecting
their interests. And I got right out in the streets and protested
against that war. And the war ended, and I felt very empowered. I
felt like I had something to do with it. Whether or not I did is
not the point, you know. I felt like I did.''
 &HT;    I was struck by the thematic resemblance in ``Poisonwood'' to
two books that came out last spring: Jane Smiley's ``The All-True
Travels and Adventures of Lidie Newton'' and Russell Banks'
``Cloudsplitter.'' All three novels revisit the actions of white
people living side by side with blacks at a critical period in
history. All three are long, dense and mournful over white
arrogance of the past.
 &HT;    I called Banks to see if he thought these novels constituted a
trend _ a mildly guilt-ridden white sequel to multiculturalism.
Call it the literature of re-examination, if you will.
 &HT;    ``It's inevitable as we come to the end of the century,'' he
answered. ``Fiction writers are going to reflect the culture's
desire to take its own measure. I look around, I see Don DeLillo
doing this, Thomas Pynchon, Jane Smiley. ... these are all books
that are kind of stepping back a little in time and distance to
re-examine what it is to be American. We sort of know what it means
to be on the left side of the hyphen: Italo-American,
Native-American, African-American _ but we don't know much about
what it means to be on the right side.
 &HT;    ``Part of it is the millennial swing, that sense of rhythm or
tide that pulls you. The other part of it is cultural history. When
Americans have been least sure of what it was to be American have
been periods when historical fiction has been most engaged.''
 &HT;    Banks raises an interesting point about uncertainty and the
cyclical nature of fiction. Kingsolver tells me, ``Everything I do,
from writing to raising my kids, is about preparing for the
future.''
 &HT;    Like many novelists right now, Kingsolver is preparing for that
future by atoning for the past. But one could argue, in a way, that
this retrospective mood actually confines her writing to the
present tense. Kingsolver has tended her career like a patient
gardener, weeding out nuisances and watching for predators, making
sure the seeds she's sowing take firm hold.
 &HT;    The question remains: Will the kind of political writing she
hopes to nurture flourish, and if so, for how long? Or does it
represent a corrective moment, a look back as the millennium
approaches _ an anxious pause while the world gets ready for
something new?

she is trying to replicate her experience as a little girl or make
up for shortcomings.
 &HT;    For instance: Camille has been allotted a space in the garden
behind the house, where she's expected to grow a crop. When Lily's
a little older, she'll get one too. This, it turns out, was exactly
the practice in a certain household in Carlisle, Ky., the backwater
``one valley away from Appalachia'' where Kingsolver grew up.
 &HT;    Kingsolver sounds nervous when talking about her parents, who
are still alive _ admiring but defensive. She tells me that her
father was a physician who could have made a pile of money
practicing in the city but stayed behind to deliver babies to women
in need; her mother was a homemaker with exceptional strength of
character.
 &HT;    She speaks with gratitude about the sense of responsibility they
instilled in her, the way they gently guided her toward an
appreciation of nature and books. But as soon as she can change the
subject, she does, moving toward some general statement about the
world.
 &HT;    ``My parents always gave me to know I could make a difference _
and I'd better make one.'' Pause, then the move-out: ``In some
sense, I realize it's a luxury to feel the way I do. I know there
are plenty of people who are completely overwhelmed just by
survival.''
 &HT;    It is impossible to know whether Kingsolver is (quite
understandably) trying to protect her parents' feelings or whether
her own feelings about her childhood are simply unresolved. What's
true is that in her fiction, the subject of parents is a loaded
one.
 &HT;    ``Animal Dreams'' told the story of a young woman who feels like
an outsider in her small home town and who struggles in a
relationship with her distant father _ like Kingsolver's own, a
physician.
 &HT;    The parental issue becomes even more awkward when you consider
``The Poisonwood Bible.'' The new novel is told in the voice of
five females _ the wife and four daughters of a Christian
missionary who moves his family to the Congo and sacrifices their
health and safety in order to further his arrogant dream of
``civilizing'' Africans.
 &HT;    The year 1963 happens to be the same one when the Kingsolver
family moved to the Congo. Kingsolver seems to have relatively
carefree memories of her time there _ a child's memories of
learning songs in a new language and playing in a strange, lush
forest.
 &HT;    ``The Congo sent an electric shock through my brain. It was so
interesting to live in a place with no electricity, no radio, no
running water, no plumbing. There were just worlds of people living
perfectly satisfying lives, without needing some of the stuff I'd
assumed was necessary. I looked around and thought: 'Wow! I don't
know the half of it.'''
 &HT;    Kingsolver is infuriated when readers and journalists ask her to
elaborate on the parallels between her novels and her life.
 &HT;    ``She gets very upset when she has to do interviews,'' Frances
Goldin says. ``She's fearful of saying something about her family
that will upset them. People are sometimes not sensitive. They're
going to ask her why her father went to Africa, but it's got
nothing to do with her family. They conclude it must be
autobiographical, and she can't get them off their insistence.''
Goldin sounds protective, and upset. ``She's the most polite person
I've ever met. She lives her life by her principles. She gives so
much back. So I hate to see her wounded.''
 &HT;    Still, the fact remains that the fraught theme of most of her
fiction is the same theme that comes up when she talks about her
childhood. Kingsolver assumes that people want to draw vulgar
diagrams of her work _ to find out what real person X and Y
represent.
 &HT;    But she may be underestimating readers who don't want to pry (or
vilify her parents, who sound as if they were extraordinarily
loving and conscientious) so much as they want to know more about
her experience of responsibility: its possibility for good, its
burdens, its danger when carried too far.
 &HT;    There's a palpable fragility about Kingsolver. A mistrust, even.
When we go to a friendly local restaurant, she requests a booth
seat, back against the wall, so as not to be exposed to the rest of
the room.
 &HT;    As we drive out of Tucson one afternoon, across a parched plain
studded with gnarly mesquite, she points out dozens of ostentatious
mansions that rich escapees from California are building high in
the hills. Why would anyone want to live there, she wonders,
exposed for all the world to see? Her own sleek, ecologically
responsible adobe ranch house is built into the side of a hill
outside of Tucson, screened by the trees from the scrutiny of
passers-by.
 &HT;    When she bought it three years ago, Kingsolver was daunted by
its magazine-ready glamour, so with her typical _ modesty?
practical-mindedness? guilt? _ she roughed it up a little to make
it more homey.
 &HT;    She gets much, much happier when the conversation moves from her
personal life to her political views. They seem quite deeply felt,
if occasionally dewy-eyed. She thinks the United States could learn
a thing or two from Denmark's generous social programs. She was
enraged this summer when America bombed the Sudan. She believes
that Mumia Abu Jamal, a former radio journalist and black activist
convicted of killing a policeman in Philadelphia, is being held as
a political prisoner.
 &HT;    (She sent Abu Jamal a draft of ``The Poisonwood Bible,'' and he
wrote back with extensive, helpful comments ``from the point of
view of an African-American,'' she tells me.)
 &HT;    Her capacity for outrage and hope makes me nostalgic for the
thrill I felt as a college freshman discovering the outside world _
and it turns out this is precisely the giddy age at which many of
Kingsolver's views took shape.
 &HT;    In the early 70's she entered DePauw University. She had zoomed
through high school, studying Kant and Hume for a correspondence
course in philosophy, but she had yet to learn the judgmental pop
language of American youth. The adjustment was painful. ``It was
very scary when I first got there, because there were all these
kids who looked alike and they had these clothes and these hairdos.
There was a veneer of knowing things before you know them that I
didn't have.''
 &HT;    She gradually lost her Southern accent because ``they'd hear me
say 'Hi' and they'd think how cute it was that I was wearing shoes
and it wasn't even Sunday.''
 &HT;    Soon she found a comfortable role as a campus activist, reading
``The Feminine Mystique'' (``a book that changed my life'') and
Karl Marx (``the scales fell from my eyes'') and joining sit-ins in
front of the ROTC building. This was the tail end of the Nixon era,
remember.
 &HT;    Before she went to DePauw, Kingsolver says all she knew about
Vietnam was that Kentucky boys were coming home in body bags.
``When I got to college, bang, I saw the rest of the story. Like
everything else in the world, it was rich people somehow protecting
their interests. And I got right out in the streets and protested
against that war. And the war ended, and I felt very empowered. I
felt like I had something to do with it. Whether or not I did is
not the point, you know. I felt like I did.''
 &HT;    I was struck by the thematic resemblance in ``Poisonwood'' to
two books that came out last spring: Jane Smiley's ``The All-True
Travels and Adventures of Lidie Newton'' and Russell Banks'
``Cloudsplitter.'' All three novels revisit the actions of white
people living side by side with blacks at a critical period in
history. All three are long, dense and mournful over white
arrogance of the past.
 &HT;    I called Banks to see if he thought these novels constituted a
trend _ a mildly guilt-ridden white sequel to multiculturalism.
Call it the literature of re-examination, if you will.
 &HT;    ``It's inevitable as we come to the end of the century,'' he
answered. ``Fiction writers are going to reflect the culture's
desire to take its own measure. I look around, I see Don DeLillo
doing this, Thomas Pynchon, Jane Smiley. ... these are all books
that are kind of stepping back a little in time and distance to
re-examine what it is to be American. We sort of know what it means
to be on the left side of the hyphen: Italo-American,
Native-American, African-American _ but we don't know much about
what it means to be on the right side.
 &HT;    ``Part of it is the millennial swing, that sense of rhythm or
tide that pulls you. The other part of it is cultural history. When
Americans have been least sure of what it was to be American have
been periods when historical fiction has been most engaged.''
 &HT;    Banks raises an interesting point about uncertainty and the
cyclical nature of fiction. Kingsolver tells me, ``Everything I do,
from writing to raising my kids, is about preparing for the
future.''
 &HT;    Like many novelists right now, Kingsolver is preparing for that
future by atoning for the past. But one could argue, in a way, that
this retrospective mood actually confines her writing to the
present tense. Kingsolver has tended her career like a patient
gardener, weeding out nuisances and watching for predators, making
sure the seeds she's sowing take firm hold.
 &HT;    The question remains: Will the kind of political writing she
hopes to nurture flourish, and if so, for how long? Or does it
represent a corrective moment, a look back as the millennium
approaches _ an anxious pause while the world gets ready for
something new?

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Seeing Paris through the eyes of
Texas
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By JOE MURRAY
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ I'm picking up the tab for an oyster dinner but, still,
Kyle Jarrard is paying a price.
</P>
<P>
   This is the night that French TV shows ``Star Trek.'' Kyle, an
old friend and a Texan to boot, says he'd rather have dinner with
me.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle, a novelist, says a lot of things.
</P>
<P>
   In his recently completed novel, his third in the last several
years, Kyle says what he actually thinks of France, where he has
lived and written since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Roundabouts _ what my people call traffic circles _ feature
prominently.
</P>
<P>
   The book, ``Bastille Day Weekend,'' centers on a village in
France (not unlike the one where the family of Kyle's French wife
owns a country home) and symbolizes ``everything that's wrong with
France,'' the author says.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it has become the village of the dammed, ever
since a government project diverted the river and, as a result of
the dam, polluted its waters.
</P>
<P>
   As for the roundabout, the book version of the village never had
need for so much as one traffic circle. Now, thanks to corrupt
politics and payoffs by contractors to local officials, dozens
surround the little town.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the book's plot is a terrorist plan to dynamite
the dam during Bastille Day weekend, though this French legion of
inept anarchists is more humorous than murderous.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the basis of the story. Such, for its author, is the
basis of his problem with publishers.
</P>
<P>
   His French agent's initial reaction was that of ``Perplexed.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyle, almost immediately, felt the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perplexed?'' he pondered. ``Is that bad?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm wondering,'' she wondered aloud, ``if the French people
will be insulted.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a political correctioness thing with a French twist.
</P>
<P>
   To wit: Can a foreigner write a book about France without
offending the French?
</P>
<P>
   Kyle, who is in his early 40s and an editor at the International
Herald Tribune, thinks he has paid his French dues, and then some,
over the past 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   He is married to a French woman. Their children are growing up
more French than American. They are even in the process of
investing in a home.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about French dues. Talk about Paris real estate.
</P>
<P>
   A three bedroom, one bath home in a subdivision of lots closer
to the size of burial plots costs in the neighborhood of $350,000.
And it's not even that good of a neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have muddy little yards, and some of the walls even touch
each other at the property lines,'' Kyle muttered.
</P>
<P>
   So it is, in fact, that he and his family find themselves
thinking more and more of Texas where there's plenty of wide open
spaces, though about the same density of closed minds.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle's first novel, ``Over There,'' which takes place in Paris,
Texas, (though not Paris, Texas) and Mexico was a puzzlement for
more than a few critics.
</P>
<P>
   Some found it incomprehensible, and I liked it a lot.
</P>
<P>
   His second novel, ``Down In There,'' mostly about Mexico, is
being shopped around by Kyle's agents, so far without success.
</P>
<P>
   One must wonder:
</P>
<P>
   Can a Texan living in Paris write a novel about Mexico without
offending the island nation of Seychelles in the Indian Ocean?
</P>
<P>
   It's a marketing thing. You wouldn't understand.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. We'll always have Paris. And right now I think I'll
have another plate of oysters, Paris style.

WOMEN AGAIN ASKING FOR IMPLANTS; SALINE TOUTED AS SAFER THAN
SILICONE GEL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLIFFORD PUGH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few years ago, Houston cosmetic surgeon Dr. Henry Mentz rarely
met a patient who wanted breast implants. Instead, many women with
silicone-gel implants were clamoring to have them removed amid
reports they might be unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   But now, his office is swamped with women who are lining up for
the surgery _ this time for saline implants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we're obsessed, but American women like to
have bigger breasts,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic surgeons nationwide are reporting the same thing.
Despite continued health concerns about the safety of implants and
an ongoing debate about what constitutes feminine beauty, a growing
number of women are again opting for cosmetic surgery to enlarge
their breasts.
</P>
<P>
   The American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons
reports that the number of breast-implant procedures has soared
nationwide nearly 40 percent in the past two years to more than
122,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   The figures rival peak levels of eight years ago, when breast
augmentation was the No. 1 form of cosmetic surgery in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Many women say they are opting for the procedure because it
makes them feel better about themselves. They see implants as just
another way to enhance their appearance, like dying their hair or
wearing makeup.
</P>
<P>
   One Houston socialite who has appeared on the Chronicle's Best
Dressed list says she had implants about a year ago in order to fit
better into the body-conscious styles that are the rage in stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally had no desire to be real large. I didn't want to
go out and be dancing at Rick's. I just wanted to fill out my
clothes a little more,'' she says. ``Now I have a lot more freedom
when I go shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   When Stacy Thompkins lost weight during the past year, her
breasts decreased in size, along with her self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   So about six months ago, the 28-year-old interior designer had
breast-augmentation surgery that boosted her from a 34B to a 34D
cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing what a difference it's made in my appearance,''
she says. ``People just treat you differently. I hate to say it,
but it's true. A lot more doors open for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompkins says she decided to undergo surgery after researching
the subject on the Internet and convincing herself that the surgery
was safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my friends tried to talk me out of it, but once I had
it done, now they want to do it,'' she says. ``I guess it's sad in
a way, but that's the way our society is. I had the means to better
myself, so I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such testimonials, some experts suspect the resurgence
in the procedure and other types of cosmetic surgery is based more
on the unrelenting pressures on women to conform to unrealistic
ideals than the drive for self-betterment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a whole issue of how we deal with aging,'' says
Patricia Yongue, associate professor of women's studies at the
University of Houston. ``Are we going to be allowed to grow old
naturally or are we going to be put under the gun to look like
Cher?''
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, the Food and Drug Administration banned
silicone-gel implants amid growing concerns that the gel might leak
and trigger such auto-immune diseases as lupus and scleroderma.
</P>
<P>
   The number of breast-implant procedures plummeted from an
estimated 120,000-150,000 in 1990 to nearly 33,000 in 1992, the
year the FDA ban took place. Many women with the silicone-gel
implants had them removed and some opted for saline implants, which
were touted as a safer, more natural alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Franklin Rose, who built a large practice in the boom years
of the 1980s with a clientele that included models and topless
dancers, estimates he removed 1,000 pairs of silicone-gel implants
from frightened women after the FDA ban.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he is again performing several breast-augmentation
surgeries every week. He usually works with saline implants,
although he occasionally uses silicone-gel implants in an
FDA-approved experimental program.
</P>
<P>
   He says his typical client is a thirtysomething mother who wants
to have her breasts restored to pre-pregnancy perkiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The desire for an attractive breast goes back to antiquity,''
Rose says. ``Certainly our culture places a great importance on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But experts say that hasn't always been the case. During the
Middle Ages, the ideal breast was the size of a walnut, says
Lorraine Stock, an associate professor of English at the University
of Houston whose speciality is the study of medieval times.
</P>
<P>
   She points out that in the 1920s the ``flapper'' look was so
popular that busty women bound their breasts to fit into skimpy
chemise dresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a specific mark of our particular time in history that
women have been convinced that large breasts are more feminine or
more womanly than small breasts,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Mentz, whose practice is performing five times more augmentation
procedures than two years ago, believes the numbers have
skyrocketed, in part, due to pent-up demand.
</P>
<P>
   He says women desiring bigger breasts held off from having the
surgery until they could gather more information about the safety
and durability of saline implants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients are satisfied about the research that has been
done,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Saline implants have not been linked to health problems,
although scar tissue can harden around the implants in some cases
and cause discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   In some thin patients, the implant shell may wrinkle noticeably
under the skin. Some patients complain of reduced sensation in the
breast area after the surgery. As with any surgery, there is also
the risk of infection and complications from anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
   Implants also can interfere with mammography and make it more
difficult to detect cancer in early stages, says Dr. Mark
Schusterman, a cosmetic surgeon who specialized in breast
reconstruction at University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center
in Houston before going into private practice last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to tell (implant) patients that especially as they
approach 40, they need to have mammograms, and they need to be done
in a very specific manner,'' says Schusterman.``It's something
patients need to understand before they get involved with them.''
</P>
<P>
   But such drawbacks have not deterred women from flocking to the
procedure, which costs from $4,000 to $8,000 in Houston and is
usually not covered by health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Some women who have received implants say they are surprised by
the increased attention they get.
</P>
<P>
   For several months before undergoing the surgery, a 39-year-old
Houston teacher wore falsies to determine if she could handle the
added scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of attention and the `babe factor,' it's much more
than I had ever imagined,'' she says. ``There's definitely big
power in big breasts.''
</P>
<P>
   The surgery, in which saline implants were placed under the
pectoral muscle for a natural, realistic look, was so painful that
she could not open a refrigerator door for a month.

WOMEN AGAIN ASKING FOR IMPLANTS; SALINE TOUTED AS SAFER THAN
SILICONE GEL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLIFFORD PUGH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few years ago, Houston cosmetic surgeon Dr. Henry Mentz rarely
met a patient who wanted breast implants. Instead, many women with
silicone-gel implants were clamoring to have them removed amid
reports they might be unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   But now, his office is swamped with women who are lining up for
the surgery _ this time for saline implants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we're obsessed, but American women like to
have bigger breasts,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic surgeons nationwide are reporting the same thing.
Despite continued health concerns about the safety of implants and
an ongoing debate about what constitutes feminine beauty, a growing
number of women are again opting for cosmetic surgery to enlarge
their breasts.
</P>
<P>
   The American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons
reports that the number of breast-implant procedures has soared
nationwide nearly 40 percent in the past two years to more than
122,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   The figures rival peak levels of eight years ago, when breast
augmentation was the No. 1 form of cosmetic surgery in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Many women say they are opting for the procedure because it
makes them feel better about themselves. They see implants as just
another way to enhance their appearance, like dying their hair or
wearing makeup.
</P>
<P>
   One Houston socialite who has appeared on the Chronicle's Best
Dressed list says she had implants about a year ago in order to fit
better into the body-conscious styles that are the rage in stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally had no desire to be real large. I didn't want to
go out and be dancing at Rick's. I just wanted to fill out my
clothes a little more,'' she says. ``Now I have a lot more freedom
when I go shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   When Stacy Thompkins lost weight during the past year, her
breasts decreased in size, along with her self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   So about six months ago, the 28-year-old interior designer had
breast-augmentation surgery that boosted her from a 34B to a 34D
cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing what a difference it's made in my appearance,''
she says. ``People just treat you differently. I hate to say it,
but it's true. A lot more doors open for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompkins says she decided to undergo surgery after researching
the subject on the Internet and convincing herself that the surgery
was safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my friends tried to talk me out of it, but once I had
it done, now they want to do it,'' she says. ``I guess it's sad in
a way, but that's the way our society is. I had the means to better
myself, so I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such testimonials, some experts suspect the resurgence
in the procedure and other types of cosmetic surgery is based more
on the unrelenting pressures on women to conform to unrealistic
ideals than the drive for self-betterment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a whole issue of how we deal with aging,'' says
Patricia Yongue, associate professor of women's studies at the
University of Houston. ``Are we going to be allowed to grow old
naturally or are we going to be put under the gun to look like
Cher?''
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, the Food and Drug Administration banned
silicone-gel implants amid growing concerns that the gel might leak
and trigger such auto-immune diseases as lupus and scleroderma.
</P>
<P>
   The number of breast-implant procedures plummeted from an
estimated 120,000-150,000 in 1990 to nearly 33,000 in 1992, the
year the FDA ban took place. Many women with the silicone-gel
implants had them removed and some opted for saline implants, which
were touted as a safer, more natural alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Franklin Rose, who built a large practice in the boom years
of the 1980s with a clientele that included models and topless
dancers, estimates he removed 1,000 pairs of silicone-gel implants
from frightened women after the FDA ban.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he is again performing several breast-augmentation
surgeries every week. He usually works with saline implants,
although he occasionally uses silicone-gel implants in an
FDA-approved experimental program.
</P>
<P>
   He says his typical client is a thirtysomething mother who wants
to have her breasts restored to pre-pregnancy perkiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The desire for an attractive breast goes back to antiquity,''
Rose says. ``Certainly our culture places a great importance on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But experts say that hasn't always been the case. During the
Middle Ages, the ideal breast was the size of a walnut, says
Lorraine Stock, an associate professor of English at the University
of Houston whose speciality is the study of medieval times.
</P>
<P>
   She points out that in the 1920s the ``flapper'' look was so
popular that busty women bound their breasts to fit into skimpy
chemise dresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a specific mark of our particular time in history that
women have been convinced that large breasts are more feminine or
more womanly than small breasts,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Mentz, whose practice is performing five times more augmentation
procedures than two years ago, believes the numbers have
skyrocketed, in part, due to pent-up demand.
</P>
<P>
   He says women desiring bigger breasts held off from having the
surgery until they could gather more information about the safety
and durability of saline implants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients are satisfied about the research that has been
done,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Saline implants have not been linked to health problems,
although scar tissue can harden around the implants in some cases
and cause discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   In some thin patients, the implant shell may wrinkle noticeably
under the skin. Some patients complain of reduced sensation in the
breast area after the surgery. As with any surgery, there is also
the risk of infection and complications from anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
   Implants also can interfere with mammography and make it more
difficult to detect cancer in early stages, says Dr. Mark
Schusterman, a cosmetic surgeon who specialized in breast
reconstruction at University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center
in Houston before going into private practice last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to tell (implant) patients that especially as they
approach 40, they need to have mammograms, and they need to be done
in a very specific manner,'' says Schusterman.``It's something
patients need to understand before they get involved with them.''
</P>
<P>
   But such drawbacks have not deterred women from flocking to the
procedure, which costs from $4,000 to $8,000 in Houston and is
usually not covered by health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Some women who have received implants say they are surprised by
the increased attention they get.
</P>
<P>
   For several months before undergoing the surgery, a 39-year-old
Houston teacher wore falsies to determine if she could handle the
added scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of attention and the `babe factor,' it's much more
than I had ever imagined,'' she says. ``There's definitely big
power in big breasts.''
</P>
<P>
   The surgery, in which saline implants were placed under the
pectoral muscle for a natural, realistic look, was so painful that
she could not open a refrigerator door for a month. &QL;

<P>
   Even so, she is pleased with the outcome, although she is
sometimes bothered by some reactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do find some men will speak to my breasts. They won't speak
to me, and that's pretty outrageous,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   One Houston woman who had her breast implants removed after
seven years says men noticed her when she had them, but for all the
wrong reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I look back on it, I got a lot of attention from men
who ended up being not worth two seconds of my time,'' she says.
``Do you really want a man who is going to give you attention
because your breast size is bigger?''
</P>
<P>
   She says she originally got implants because she was newly
divorced and felt terribly insecure. She later met a wonderful man
(now her husband) who asked her to consider removing the implants.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if you won't like me anymore?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could fall in love with you with those fake breasts, I
can learn to love you with natural breasts,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   After having the implants taken out, her breasts returned to
their natural shape within three months. She's happy with her real
breasts and can't imagine why she felt compelled to enhance them in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, they're a little droopy, but they're real, and they're
natural, and they're proportional to my body,'' she says. ``I feel
so much more feminine without (implants).''
</P>
<P>
   There are some subtle signs that Hollywood image makers, who
have been accused of manufacturing an ideal of sexiness that no
woman could maintain, are changing their attitude about implants.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny McCarthy, the big-busted actress who shot to stardom on
MTV, advises young girls not to get breast implants. Hers just
``gave me something to make fun of,'' she told Redbook magazine,
adding she was contemplating having her implants removed.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Sally Kirkland recently underwent surgery to remove
breast implants that had given her problems for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many women look to celebrities as role models for their
appearance,'' she said. ``I don't want to feel responsible in any
way that I might be the cause of another woman getting implants and
having to suffer the way I have for 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Such actresses as Meryl Streep, Michelle Pfeiffer, Kristin Scott
Thomas and Calista Flockhart of the TV hit ``Ally McBeal'' have
resisted the urge to ``go bigger'' and are models of class and
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the new role models, some observers believe there is
still tremendous pressure in our society to conform to a standard
of beauty defined by TV shows such as ``Baywatch,'' movies and
magazine covers featuring braless babes, and the models in
Victoria's Secret catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   The pressures may be especially acute in Texas, where in many
cases, bigger is considered better.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, Texas trailed behind California and Florida in the
number of breast-implant procedures performed last year, but women
in the Lone Star state requested bigger implants than those in any
other state.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's always been the case,'' says Dr. Jim Moore. ``I guess
it goes with big blonde hair and Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore says that the average size of an implant requested in
Texas is more than double that in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not my decision. I have women put on a leotard and put
breast implants in front and look in the mirror. They decide what
size they want to be. We honor that entirely,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Others attribute the bigger size, in part, to the fact that
implants were originally invented in Houston and are considered
more acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think women like to be sexier here, and they see breasts as
part of their sexy look,'' says Dr. R. Scott Yarish, who does more
than twice as many breast-augmentation surgeries as a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most women tell me they just want to fill out their clothes or
they want to be back to where they were before they had babies, but
I think it also involves a little bit of showmanship. Women are
flashier here than anyplace I've ever been. That's part of the
flash.''
</P>
<P>
   It also may be a cultural thing. Dr. German Newall, whose
practice includes patients from South America, Central America and
Mexico, says those patients are usually more concerned than U.S.
women about appearing too big.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's blueprinted in the Latin American mind that big breasts
are not cosmetically appealing. It's the medium size they're aiming
for,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Newall performed breast reduction surgery on some
teen-age girls from Merida, Mexico, who were embarrassed about what
they considered to be large breasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``To us it would have been very attractive large breasts. For
them it was just monstrous,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   When considering implant surgery, women should make sure the
surgeon is certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery and
have all the facts before making a decision, says Schusterman.
</P>
<P>
   When patients ask him if implants are safe, he replies,
``They're as safe as any other piece of plastic you want to implant
in your body.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that in 10 percent to 20 percent of cases, scar tissue
hardens around the implants to the point that additional surgery is
necessary to remove the tissue. In some cases, the area around the
implants may become infected and have to be taken out.
</P>
<P>
   The implants also need to be monitored by a doctor for as long
as the woman has them in her body, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it is a bad option as long as women understand
what they're getting into,'' says Schusterman.
</P>
<P>
   He adds that 95 percent of women who have breast-implant surgery
nowadays are happy with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously a majority of women feel like it's a worthwhile
thing,'' he says. ``I wouldn't recommend my daughter having it
done. But if she wanted it, I'd guess I'd say, `Fine, if that's
what you want.' '' &QL;

 &HT;    BOSNIAN SERBS DEFIANT IN FACE OF POSSIBLE NATO AIR STRIKES
 &HT;    With US-KOSOVO-1014.
 &HT;    By SUSANNAH A. NESMITH 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRCKO, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ As they prepared to evacuate the
Serbian-controlled area of Bosnia Monday, international officials
worried that NATO airstrikes in Kosovo might derail the stumbling
peace process in this part of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   As they talked about returning their jobs Tuesday, having heard
that airstrikes probably were not going to happen, they worried
that the whole Kosovo conflict had already done a lot of damage
here.
</P>
<P>
   For over a week, politicians both in Yugoslavia and in Bosnia
have been calling on all ethnic Serbs, wherever they might be, to
prepare to retaliate against Westerners if NATO bombs Yugoslavia.
Some have suggested that a NATO airstrike could lead to armed
conflicts in Bosnia, and even mean the end of the Dayton Peace
accords.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the International Police Task Force, the United
Nations agency charged with reforming and monitoring Bosnia's
civilian police force, felt the heat immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``IPTF has nothing to do with NATO, but sure, we're part of the
international community here,'' said Stefo Lehmann, spokesman for
the Brcko (pronounced ``Burch-Ko'') IPTF office. ``One of our
officers, a guy came up to him and said, 'You boom-boom Belgrade.
We boom-boom you.'''
</P>
<P>
   With warnings like that in mind, the U.S. State Department
issued the order Monday morning for all Americans to evacuate the
Serbian-controlled area, before Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic agreed to NATO demands Monday night apparently
forestalling an airstrike.
</P>
<P>
   A political advisor for an international agency sat in his Brcko
office Monday morning, his suitcase packed, fielding calls from
other members of the international community wondering if he had
heard anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Status quo here. Sphincter muscles are tight,'' he told one
caller.
</P>
<P>
   Asking that his name not be used, he said he figured NATO
airstrikes would cripple the U.S. effort in the Serbian area of
Bosnia by further radicalizing the people who are already
suspicious of Western efforts here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does this set us back? Sure. Absolutely. The elections set us
back months. And this is worse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the September elections, the Serb Radical Party, an
anti-Western party based in Belgrade and operating in both Bosnia
and Yugoslavia won several important seats, including the
presidency of the Serb state within Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton Peace accords which ended the ethnic war here three
years ago divided Bosnia into two states -- a Serbian Republic and
a Croat/Muslim Federation -- each with its own president, prime
minister and military. Since the peace accords were signed in
December 1995, officials in the Serbian Republic have resisted the
ethnic reintegration of Bosnia called for in Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that resistance, the Serbian Republic has maintained
close ties to Yugoslavia, sharing things like a telephone system,
currency and political parties.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb Radical Party chairman, Vojislav Seselj, is deputy
prime minister in Yugoslavia. Before the elections, he said the
Serb Republic should secede from Bosnia and abandon Dayton. For the
past week, he has been urging all Serbs, in Yugoslavia and
elsewhere, to get ready to retaliate against Western officials,
foreign and local journalists and local civic activists. He has
labeled all of the above spies and warned that they might be taken
hostage in the event of an airstrike.
</P>
<P>
   And Seselj isn't the only one urging vengeance. Last week, the
Office of the High Representative, the international supervisor of
Bosnia, removed a member of the Serbian Republic parliament from
office because of similar statements.
</P>
<P>
   One of the groups Seselj has said might be attacked is the
Helsinki Committee for Human Rights. Branko Todorovic, president of
the Serbian Republic chapter of the Helsinki Committee, has
received death threats in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a dangerous political mafia which is equally active
both in Yugoslavia and in the Serbian Republic,'' he said. ``It is
a pity that a lot of our politicians go to Belgrade to get advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seselj has complete control over the Serbian Republic,'' he
added. ``The politicians on both sides of the border (between
Yugoslavia and Bosnia) are using the Kosovo issue to drum up
support.''
</P>
<P>
   On the streets, the hard-line message had been heard and was
being repeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like your country too much,'' said Aleksic Danko, a
19-year-old forestry student. ``A lot of our policeman and soldiers
were killed in Kosovo, but the world doesn't want to see that. But
when our soldiers kill a few terrorists, the whole world knows
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not scared of NATO,'' he said defiantly. ``There are a
lot of Serbs in a lot of places.''
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday afternoon, the threat of a NATO airstrike seemed to
be receding, at least in the cafes of Sarajevo, where evacuated
international officials gathered to exchange theories. One theory:
Even if NATO takes no action, the damage has been done in the
Serbian Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's so worked up over this, it will take a long time
for them to calm down, to forget that they hate us,'' said a
contractor working for the U.N. ``I mean . . . I'll go to work, and
I'll try to talk to the same people I spoke with last week. But
they know . . . I had to leave because my country was threatening
to bomb their brethren in Yugoslavia. Doesn't make for a good
working relationship.''

POWER STRUGGLE REVISITED OVER DEREGULATION IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By George Raine  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ At the end of August 1996, a legislative
committee, ringed by lobbyists, worked without much sleep for some
200 hours to wrap up a two-year effort to deregulate the
electricity industry in California.
</P>
<P>
   The final stretch was appropriately called ``the Steve Peace
death march,'' after the committee co-chairman, a Senate Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the shrill debate today over who has actually
benefited from deregulation, the death march seems like the good
old days.
</P>
<P>
   The law that broke the century-old grip of utility monopolies on
power generation and allowed customers to choose their own
electricity provider has been excoriated by consumer advocates as
corporate welfare for utilities.
</P>
<P>
   A group of these critics gathered sufficient petition signatures
to place on the Nov. 3 ballot Proposition 9, which would undo
elements of the law Santa Monica activist Harvey Rosenfield calls
``the greatest single con job I have seen in 20 years as an
advocate.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfield, who led the consumers' effort on behalf of auto
insurance reform _ Proposition 103 _ 11 years ago, is the co-author
of Proposition 9. It would prohibit the utilities from passing on
to rate payers the costs of repaying $6 billion in bonds the
utilities issued to finance a 10 percent rate cut for those same
customers.
</P>
<P>
   It would also eliminate utility charges for operating
unprofitable nuclear power plants and promises a 20 percent rate
cut for residential and small business customers.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, some of Proposition 9's biggest proponents either
supported or did not oppose the original deregulation law when it
passed the Legislature _ unanimously and amid much fanfare _ in
1996. The state's leading consumer group, The Utility Reform
Network (TURN), participated in the lobbying and writing process
and in the end said it was neutral.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Quentin Kopp, a San Francisco independent, voted in
favor of the bill but is now supporting the Yes on Proposition 9
effort. ``There was a mantra that deregulation is good, regulation
is bad, and everyone was swept into the mantra. Including me,'' he
said. ``The more I thought about it I was repulsed by the notion of
lending the utilities money to pay their debt.'' But to overturn
the past, Kopp and others have found, is a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is driving out of the rear view mirror,'' said
Commissioner Gregory Conlon of the California Public Utilities
Commission. ``After (deregulation) passes they say, `Look how bad
this thing is.' It's a little late, guys.''
</P>
<P>
   For the measure's proponents, one problem is an enormous money
gap: As of Sept. 30, the No on 9 Coalition had collected $30.1
million and spent $22.7 million, according to the Secretary of
State's office.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money is being spent on television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Yes on 9, on the other hand, had collected $1,229,866 and spent
$1,247,971. Representatives of the group say it has no advertising
budget and is endeavoring to tell its story through the news media
and volunteers knocking on doors.
</P>
<P>
   The utilities, Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric Co., San Diego Gas &AMP;
Electric and Southern California Edison, are the principal donors
to the No on 9 Coalition. Opponents of the measure include both
major political parties and their gubernatorial candidates,
Democrat Gray Davis and Republican Dan Lungren; major trade
associations representing large power users who have already
benefited from deregulation; and labor and hundreds of other
business and local government groups that say Proposition 9 could
lead to higher taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco-based Consumers Union, which publishes
Consumer Report, found in state filings that several people
associated with groups that signed ballot pamphlet arguments
against Proposition 9 have received contributions from the
utilities and No on 9 Coalition. They include a former TV consumer
reporter David Horowitz, paid $106,000 as a consultant, and Gerald
Meral, executive director of the Planning and Conservation League,
who was paid $70,000. Meral heads a committee called ``Yes on 7 (a
clean air measure), No on 9.''
</P>
<P>
   Horowitz did not return a telephone call and Meral said he was
not influenced to oppose Proposition 9 by a contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainty about the outcome of Proposition 9 brought
Houston-based Enron Corp., one of the world's largest integrated
natural gas and electricity companies, into the fold of the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to improve electric restructuring and make it
more competitive is through the regulatory and legislative process,
while a proposition will stop the clock and probably set it back
quite a bit through legal challenges that would tie it up in courts
for years,'' said Enron spokesman Gary Foster. ``Proposition 9
could throw the entire deregulation law into jeopardy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Enron has signed contracts with major California customers,
including Pacific Bell and the University of California and
California State University systems, but it said in April that it
found no opportunity for profit in competing for smaller customers,
because the current deregulation rules favor the existing
utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfield is undaunted by the odds. ``Every once in a while an
initiative comes along that exposes the corruption in cash register
politics in this state, and Proposition 9 is one of those.''
</P>
<P>
   He alleges California's investor-owned utilities had their way
with a legislature more concerned with the art of the deal than
with consumer protection.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Proposition 9 passes, a blizzard of lawsuits is likely. The
proponents themselves recognize a flaw in the initiative's bond
section: The contract clause of the U.S. Constitution says neither
the federal government nor any state may impair a contract, like
the one existing between the utilities and bondholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at that proposition and see a legal nightmare,'' said
Bill Dombrowski, president of the Sacramento-based California
Retailers Association, representing some 9,000 department,
specialty, grocery and chain drug stores in California.
</P>
<P>
   The association is one of many representing large energy users
that have benefited from electric deregulation since it took effect
March 31.
</P>
<P>
   But it will be four years before residential and small business
users see meaningful competition and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the electric restructuring law that Proposition
9 attacks created a four-year transition period, giving utilities
an opportunity to pay down perhaps as much as $20 billion in
``stranded costs.'' These costs include some $5 billion in nuclear
plants, other generating facilities and power contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Peace said he was offended by his opponents' tactics and use of
the initiative process to undo deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I frankly have never seen more irresponsible and deceitful
conduct in 16 years of public life,'' he said. ``They have total
disregard for truth. I was very aggressive about trying to make
sure everybody had the opportunity to participate in the process.
But the pro-Proposition 9 people demonstrate precisely the
irresponsible, childish behavior that ultimately leads to people
not believing in the system.''

FRESH THOUGHTS ELUSIVE EVEN FOR RESTED WOMEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   According to S. Freud, men think about sex a dozen or more times
a day.
</P>
<P>
   Women, especially married women with children, like me, are far
less likely to think about sex. Freud says that we average one
fleeting sexual thought a day unless we're on vacation, in which
case we equal the men.
</P>
<P>
   That's Sherman Freud, by the way. He's the guy who delivers the
bottled water to my office. He was right about the Cowboys and the
Vikings last week, so I'll at least entertain the thought.
</P>
<P>
   After pondering this baffling statistic for a while, I decided
to monitor my thoughts closely for an entire day just to see if
Freud was right. I chose a Monday because I'm still fresh then and,
therefore, most likely to have fresh thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   6 a.m.: Rise and shine. OK _ just rise. Put on robe and make
coffee. Wake children. Husband is gone, can't remember where he
went. Don't care. Drink coffee. Go to work.
</P>
<P>
   8 a.m.: Start work. Act friendly, help people. Wonder what to
eat for lunch. Admire assistant's new hairstyle. Get hot. Adjust
thermostat. Count days until next vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Noon: Go to Mexican restaurant. Order Greek salad with French
dressing. Waiter is attractive, nice cologne, tight jeans. Almost
think of sex, then remember that youngest son needs new jeans. Eat
salad and make grocery list.
</P>
<P>
   2 p.m.: Call spouse at work. He says, ``Hey baby, what's up?''
Flashback to college days, when he always called me ``baby.'' Feel
warm and fuzzy momentarily;then I remember labor pains. Ask husband
to bring home bread and chips. Hang up.
</P>
<P>
   5 p.m.: Drive home and change into something comfortable. Help
with homework while cooking dinner. Open mail, return calls, read
newspaper. Read about sex but have no independent thoughts about
the subject.
</P>
<P>
   10 p.m.: Prepare for bed. Think about sex while brushing teeth.
Husband is watching Monday night football and yelling at the
television. Not romantic. Crush thought and go to bed.
</P>
<P>
   12 p.m.: Did not hear spouse enter room and come to bed. Hear
son scratch his ear and shiver in his bedroom. Get up, wash son's
ear, apply cortisone, put extra blanket on him. Climb over husband,
fluff pillow, go back to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   6 a.m. Rise.
</P>
<P>
   Gosh, I guess ol' Sherman's onto something. Just to make sure
that I wasn't weird, I called several friends of various ages,
races, and professions. Friends assured me that I'm normal, and
possibly above average. No one had an explanation for the thought
drought. Everyone updated me on their children's latest
accomplishment and their horrendous workload. We concluded that
thinking about romance is just another responsibility, like paying
bills or balancing the checkbook. It should be assigned to one
spouse so that there is no confusion and things don't get out of
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Wait; I think I'm about to have one of those thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Nah, it was just gas.
</P>

SCHOOLS FACE `DIGITAL DIVIDE' OVER COMPUTER USAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When it comes to computer skills in the classroom,
there's a troubling ``digital divide'' between higher-income
students who have computers at home and lower-income students who
don't, according to a survey of educators released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the survey found that computers in schools help
students at all achievement levels to perform better but the
respondents urged better training of teachers on how to teach
computer skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that should concern all of us,'' said Paul
Houston, executive director of American Association of School
Administrators, which co-sponsored the study along with Lightspan
Partnership Inc., a San Diego-based educational software firm. He
spoke at a news conference unveiling the survey of teachers,
principals and superintendents.
</P>
<P>
   While 86 percent of those surveyed said home computers help get
parents involved in their childrens' education, only 8 percent who
work in low-income schools reported the majority of their students
have computers, Houston said.
</P>
<P>
   The divide appears more pronounced in rural and urban areas,
compared with suburban areas.
</P>
<P>
   Among rural educators, 74 percent said less than half their
students have home computers. For urban educators, the figure was
73 percent. But among suburban educators, 46 percent said less than
half their students have home computers.
</P>
<P>
   At least one school district reported it is taking steps to
close the ``digital divide.'' With $800,000 in federal and state
grants, the school system in Wichita, Kansas, gave simple computers
to students for home use in three high-poverty schools.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen Carol Holmes, a Wichita elementary school principal, told
the news conference that the lowest-achieving students in those
schools did nearly 50 percent better in reading and math than
comparable students in schools without the home computers.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, of 811 teachers, principals and superintendents
surveyed, 78 percent said computers and educational software had
yielded solid gains in student achievement. And 30 percent said
computers had helped low-performing students achieve higher test
scores, with 42 percent saying they had enabled these students to
master the content of a particular school subject.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty percent reported increased motivation among low-achieving
students, many of them from poverty-stricken areas, and 28 percent
reported decreased behavioral problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the survey results, we concluded that educational
technology is working for students and working for teachers, and
that it does help student performance especially in low-performing
schools,'' said John Kernan, chairman and CEO of the Lightspan
Partnership.
</P>
<P>
   The survey contrasts with a separate study released two weeks
ago by the New Jersey-based Educational Testing Service, which
administers the college entrance exams. That survey of 14,000
fourth and eighth graders showed that students who spent more time
on computers actually did not do as well on math exams as students
who spent less time.
</P>
<P>
   The ETS study said computers can be beneficial but only when
students use them to learn real-life applications of math concepts,
instead of for repetitive drills. It also noted that success with
computers depends in large measure on the teachers' own computer
skills.
</P>
<P>
   That concern was reflected in the survey released Tuesday. Among
superintendents and principals who make budget decisions, 84
percent reported that computer purchases got the lion's share of
their schools' overall technology budget. Only 26 percent reported
that teacher training in computers and software got such high
priority.
</P>
<P>
   When asked the most effective way to help students get the most
out of computers in the future, 42 percent said provide additional
instruction to teachers on the use of educational software.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are behind the curve,'' said Houston. Compared to computer
hardware purchases, computer training for teachers is ``a much
tougher sell.''
</P>
<P>
   When schools purchase computers, ``It's easy to say `this is
what your money bought.' You put money into staff development, it's
real hard to trot that out. Yet we know that's a real part of it
... There is a gap there.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has made computers in schools a centerpiece of
his educational policy, setting a goal of wiring all schools to the
Internet by the year 2000. The administration is spending $425
million this year in technology grants to schools, part of an
overall effort projected at $2 billion.

AUTUMNAL PARADOX: PICK A SEASON, ANY SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's autumn in New York. A chill is nudging through
the last trace of summer's warmth, and the leaves hint of turning.
The signs can't be missed _ except, maybe, if you're a chef.
</P>
<P>
   After all the lip service New York's best cooks have given to
seasonal cooking, some have decided that they will cook seasonally,
all right, but they will be the ones to choose exactly which
season.
</P>
<P>
   Just take a look at what's on the menu this week:
</P>
<P>
   A ``winter vegetable plate'' at L'Absinthe on the Upper East
Side. A ``terrine of spring vegetables and goat cheese'' at
Provence in SoHo. A ``Long Island summer corn chowder'' at One3, in
Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   And on the fall menu at Patroon in midtown, ``a spring asparagus
soup served chilled with fresh crab.'' Asked about that spring
asparagus, the chef, Geoffrey Zakarian, said the menu listing
referred to a variety he gets from upstate New York. ``I like the
name,'' he said. ``It sounds wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   But as it turns out, ``spring'' is not a variety of asparagus.
And this time of year, Zakarian buys asparagus shipped from South
America.
</P>
<P>
   At Provence, Liz Arana, the chef, puts eggplant, zucchini,
yellow squash, tomato, red and yellow peppers and asparagus in the
vegetable terrine printaniere (which means ``springlike''). It is
on the lunch menu just now, and she says she keeps the terrine
pretty much the same year round. ``These vegetables are always in
season _ zucchini and squash,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It's true, of course. They are always in season _ somewhere.

ANTIQUES DEALERS KEEP A WATCHFUL EYE ON WHAT THEY BUY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN WECHSLER  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUDSON, N.Y. _ When the middle-aged stranger walked into
Townhouse Antiques about a week ago looking to sell some
merchandise, owner George Jurgsatis was immediately interested.
</P>
<P>
   The man told Jurgsatis he was the owner of an antiques shop in
the Catskills that was closing. He wanted to unload some items.
Outside, in the back seat of his car, were a number of items,
including a $150 Empire mirror that was easily worth twice that.
</P>
<P>
   Jurgsatis liked the mirror. He was ready to pay for it. But he
didn't. There was simply no way to know if that mirror was stolen
or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't feel comfortable buying it,'' he said. ``I just
didn't know him.''
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the genteel surface of antiques is a darker side that
many dealers would prefer to not discuss.
</P>
<P>
   The case of multiple killer and antiques thief Gary Evans
exposed another side to this genteel world of gilded frames and
elegant Windsor chairs. Evans, who confessed to killing five
people, specialized in stealing rare and valuable antiques. He
killed himself after escaping from the U.S. Marshals Service and
jumped off a bridge in Troy, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But dealers say thieves are the exception.
</P>
<P>
   Most fine arts and antiques stolen in the United States are
taken by someone who has no idea of its value _ and then hocked to
a dealer who, most likely, does not know what he's buying is
stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to be in this business, you're going to end up
with something stolen,'' said R. William Vollbrecht, owner of an
antiques store here.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers say they have to exercise caution when purchasing
antiques and books. Most dealers say they'd rather pass up on a
good deal then get stuck with something hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's risk enough,'' Jurgsatis said. ``Plus, it's not good for
your reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the world, the sale of stolen antiques and fine arts
makes up the fourth-largest black-market trade, after drugs,
money-laundering and weapons, according to Interpol, the
international police agency. It's estimated that the illegal
trading of stolen antiques runs between $2 billion and $6 billion
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, for example, the theft of art, antiques and
collectibles is more costly than automobile thefts. In prisons
there, one of the most popular television programs is ``Antiques
Roadshow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're stealing items for the same reason they're stealing
your car,'' said Anna Kisluk, New York director of the Art Loss
Registry. ``For the money.''
</P>
<P>
   The registry is a London-based organization that keeps a
worldwide database of stolen ``items of culture.'' Their list
contains more than 100,000 items, everything from Tiffany lamps to
an Aston-Martin automobile. The list is used not only by crime
victims but by buyers who want to check on the authenticity of an
item they're about to purchase.

   Evans, who once nabbed an $80,000 Audubon book from a library,
wasn't the only one dealing with rare items. Earlier this year,
Daniel Spiegelman of Yonkers, N.Y., was sentenced to 5 years in
prison and fined $314,150 for stealing rare books from a Columbia
University library. The rare items included a letter from George
Washington, hundreds of hand-painted maps cut from an extremely
rare 1667 German atlas and a number of medieval works.
</P>
<P>
   Spiegelman was caught in 1995 after trying to pass the items off
to a dealer in the Netherlands who recognized the items from a list
of stolen material.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, most antiques journals include a report of
stolen items, with photos and a contact number.

<P>
   Comfort food _ that buzz phrase embracing all the bland, soft
satisfactions of childhood eating _ doesn't quite have the cachet
now that it did a few years ago, when restaurants everywhere were
trying to outdo each other in the evocation of home and hearth.
</P>
<P>
   But somehow, one of those quintessentially comforting foods,
mashed potatoes, has not only held on in popularity, but also
managed to ease right into the turbulent mainstream of today's
creative cookery.
</P>
<P>
   Mashed potatoes, it turns out, can do or be anything: they form
the basis for foods as varied as pancakes, noodles and tortes; they
serve as a platform for that seared fish fillet pinned with a
spring of herbs; they morph from Cajun to Mediterranean, and they
even find their way into desserts. And while some of today's
adaptations are just as comforting as ever, others can be
unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   They are a blank canvas, waiting to be embellished with a chef's
truffles, goat cheese, garlic or wasabi. Stefano Battistini, at
Fresco in midtown, offers at least five kinds of mashed potatoes,
including parsnip and white truffle with quail eggs.
</P>
<P>
   A restaurant in Chicago, the Mashed Potato Club, offers more
than 100 possible toppings for mashed potatoes, including
anchovies, pickled beets, jalapenos, granola and peanut butter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first opened we had plain mashed potatoes with or
without gravy,'' said Greg Kovach, the owner, who picked the name
because he always served mashed potatoes when he entertained at
home and his friends insisted he feature them on the menu. ``Then
people kept requesting toppings, so we kept adding them to the
list,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Of course, Joel Robuchon didn't need jalapenos or granola. He
made his reputation, at his Michelin three-star restaurant in
Paris, now closed, with a sublime, unadorned _ but indecently
buttered _ potato puree.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, the inclination toward variation has traditional roots.
Boosting mashed potatoes with distinctive flavors or using their
pliant texture to enhance other foods is common in many cuisines.
They are used to temper salt cod for Mediterranean baccala and fish
roe for Greek taramosalata. They provide the crust, traced with a
fork perhaps to create crispy little ridges, for an English
shepherd's pie. Rolled in crumbs, small cylinders or balls, they
can be deep-fried as croquettes. And when mixed with flour, mashed
potatoes can be turned into pastalike Italian gnocchi, often
colored and seasoned with spinach as they are at Osteria del Circo
in midtown.
</P>
<P>
   Tradition is also important at Sonora, a new restaurant on East
39th Street, where Rafael Palomino mixes mashed potatoes with black
beans. ``It's a variation on a winter dish we eat at home in
Colombia, made with red beans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thinned down, mashed potatoes become a hot or cold soup _ think
vichyssoise _ and even a creamy yet creamless sauce. In Tunisia,
they cushion the runny egg in the fried pastry turnover called
brik. New England cooks know that mashed potatoes in the batter
guarantee tender doughnuts. And mashed potatoes are inextricably
joined with sausages in England for bangers and mash.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago in Rome, at Bramante, a stylish restaurant near
the Piazza Navona, a ``tortino di patate,'' a kind of mashed potato
pie studded with bits of mortadella and topped with bread crumbs,
was an excellent first course. The tortino turned out to be just
mashed potatoes _ they had formed their own crisp, pastrylike crust
during baking. Was it a coincidence that this little restaurant
also serves wonderful meatloaf?
</P>
<P>
   But there's no reason to abandon the plain mashed potatoes of
every childhood in America. Though I use mashed potatoes to prepare
dishes like baccala, when I serve mashed potatoes at home, whether
for a family meal or a formal dinner party, they are usually plain,
with just some pureed garlic perhaps. And I do it the old-fashioned
way, using a heavy old-fashioned potato ricer with its extra-fine
screen that I found for $1 at a yard sale many years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In my mother's kitchen, mashed potatoes bound fish cakes and,
with the addition of flour and eggs, became little Austrian
noodles. Occasionally, she would wrap the same dough around small
purple plums to make dumplings called zwetschken knoedel, which she
boiled and served rolled in buttered, sugared bread crumbs seasoned
with cinnamon. This was one of my father's favorite dishes, and it
had to be eaten with all the care one takes with chicken Kiev lest
the plum juices squirt all over the place when the dumpling is cut.
</P>
<P>
   Dumplings like these are now being served at the Monkey Bar,
whose pastry chef, Anna Elisabeth Altenburg, is a native of
Salzburg, Austria. She serves them with a Concord grape and plum
sauce. The menu calls them Austrian plum dumplings, not even giving
a hint of mashed potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   If there's a season for mashed potatoes, it's starting now, and
not because this year's crop was just harvested. Thanksgiving is
just around the corner. And the commonplace, everyday mashed potato
pulls off yet another wonderful trick: call on it to be festive
and, sure enough, it will be.

EATING WELL: SUCCESS FOR NEW U.S. STANDARDS ON MEAT AND POULTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The federal government's new system for reducing contamination
in meat and poultry appears to be having positive results. Two
weeks ago, the Agriculture Department announced that the system has
almost cut in half the number of broiler chickens contaminated with
salmonella in the plants where it is in use. It has also greatly
reduced the amount of salmonella-infected pork.
</P>
<P>
   The system, called Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points,
and also known as Haacp (pronounced HASS-ip), became mandatory in
January at the largest meat and poultry processing plants (like
Perdue's and Tyson's). By the year 2000, the standards will include
smaller plants as well. Under Haacp, plants must identify critical
points in the production process where contamination is likely to
occur and implement plans to prevent the contamination.
</P>
<P>
   The system, with its routine testing for various bacteria, marks
the first time the federal government has set microbial standards
and required industry and government testing on such a large scale.
</P>
<P>
   It is a definite step up from the old sniff-and-poke method.
</P>
<P>
   There are many ways for producers to reduce the levels of
contamination to meet the system's standards. Scientific study has
increased in the wake of highly publicized outbreaks of food-borne
illness as well as huge and costly recalls of tainted food,
especially ground beef.
</P>
<P>
   Critics charge that the meat and poultry industries resisted
change. It was easier _ and cheaper _ to tell consumers it was
their fault if they got sick from eating tainted beef or chicken
because they had mishandled it. The industry realized that sales of
its products were affected by these incidents. More or less.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the ideas for safer food are so simple you wonder why no
one ever thought of them before. More humane handling of cattle,
for example, reduces stress and thereby reduces shedding of deadly
E. coli 0157:H7. When the cattle are stressed, the E. coli are
released from their intestinal tract and are excreted in their
manure.
</P>
<P>
   And just last month, scientists at Cornell University discovered
that if cattle were switched from a diet of grain to a diet of hay
or fresh grass for five days before slaughter, E. coli 0157:H7 is
virtually eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   No one is suggesting that any of the new technologies will
completely eliminate the hazards associated with eating raw or
minimally processed foods. And in fact, recalls of contaminated
food do not appear to have fallen. Late last month, about two
million pounds of meat and poultry headed for institutional use
were recalled because of salmonella contamination at a Georgia
processing plant.
</P>
<P>
   But the new ideas can reduce the level of risk. Some of them,
like inoculating animals with ``good'' bacteria to crowd out the
dangerous bacteria, have already won federal approval; others are
still in the development stage.
</P>
<P>
   Some of New York City's best-known chickens are already
participating in a new technology called competitive exclusion.
One-quarter of Bell &AMP; Evans chickens are being sprayed with
Preempt, a mixture of friendly bacteria that prevent harmful
bacteria like salmonella from ever taking hold. The spray, produced
by MS Bioscience Inc. in Madison, Wis., has been approved by the
Food and Drug Administration. The president of Bell &AMP; Evans, Scott
Sechler, says that eventually, all the company's chickens will be
treated with Preempt.
</P>
<P>
   The president of MS Bioscience, Dr. John DeLoach, says the
chickens are sprayed in the hatchery and within two days they have
a lifetime protection against salmonella.
</P>
<P>
   But the spray is only part of the MS Bioscience regimen: there
must also be clean litter for the chickens, and neither antibiotics
nor growth promoters can be used. DeLoach admits he is not sure
what part is responsible for the success.
</P>
<P>
   Sechler said: ``We are very happy with the results so far. For
the most part we found completely negative tests with a very small
amount of positives. The percentages amazed us.''
</P>
<P>
   Possible future treatments include the work of Dr. Michael
Doyle, who is the director of the Center for Food Safety and
Quality Enhancement at the University of Georgia. Doyle is
experimenting with another form of competitive exclusion, giving
young calves an oral dose of friendly E. coli bacteria to prevent
the growth of E. coli 0157:H7. But sufficient tests for FDA
approval are at least two years away, Doyle said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have been working on the egg front as well.
Pasteurized Eggs LP of Laconia, N.H., has patented a technique for
pasteurizing eggs in their shells. The eggs would carry an
Agriculture Department shield that certifies them as pasteurized
and 99.999 percent salmonella free. The company says that the
pasteurized eggs will retain their characteristic taste, appearance
and cooking characteristics. Welcome back sunny side up and real
Caesar salad.
</P>
<P>
   Shady Brook Farms has been using trisodium phosphate, an
anti-bacterial rinse, on its turkey carcasses for several years,
and according to the company it virtually eliminates such disease
causing bacteria as E. coli 0157:H7, salmonella and listeria.
</P>
<P>
   But elimination of all bacteria from food is neither feasible
nor desirable. There is such a thing as ``too pristine,'' James
Jay, a microbiologist at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas,
said. Getting rid of all bacteria on a carcass leaves the meat with
no protection if it is recontaminated, he added.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what improvements are made to reduce the levels of
harmful bacteria in the food supply, everyone still needs to be
careful at home and follow the recommendations for safe handling.

WINE: ZABACO PINOT NOIR 1995, RUSSIAN RIVER, SONOMA COUNTY, CALIF.
ABOUT $11. 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The label on this most attractive pinot noir would have you
believe it was made by a winery called Zabaco in Healdsburg, Calif.
That is true up to a point; there is a Zabaco Winery, but it is
also known as E.&AMP; J. Gallo.
</P>
<P>
   Zabaco is one of a number of labels the Gallos use for the
lower-priced wines made in their new Sonoma County winery. They
also make pinot noir under the Indigo Hills and Anapamu labels, the

 &HT;    Within Cowboys' secondary, Smith's play primary concern
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In an otherwise positive season for the Dallas
Cowboys, cornerback Kevin Smith continues to be missing in action
at crucial moments.
</P>
<P>
   Some consider Smith the only weak link in a secondary that ranks
among the best in the NFL. As long as Deion Sanders continues to
line up on one side of the field, Smith will be targeted by
opposing offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys improved to 4-2 after Sunday's 27-20 victory over
Carolina, but concerns about Smith's breakdowns run rampant. The
Panthers took an early lead when Raghib Ismail blazed past Smith
for a long scoring pass.
</P>
<P>
   That was the latest in a long line of busted coverages for
Smith, a seven-year pro who remains immensely popular in the
Cowboys locker room. Yet his inability to stay with opposing
receivers is a problem the Cowboys have addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like everybody and their brothers want to jump on
Kevin's case,'' said Coach Chan Gailey, who has no plans of
removing Smith from the lineup. ``Is he playing as aggressively as
I'd like? At times he is and at times he isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, Smith is a good player who _ fairly or not _
gets the bulk of work in the Cowboys secondary. It is not unusual
for opponents to throw exclusively to Smith's side of the field, as
long as Sanders is on the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is not to give up and just don't give up any
touchdowns,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas secondary had its worst game of the season Sunday
against Carolina. Panthers backup quarterback Steve Beuerlein threw
for 286 yards and three touchdowns. Among the Cowboys he burned on
deep passes were Smith and strong safety Darren Woodson.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, however, said beating the Panthers should outweigh
whatever mistakes the Cowboys made. He admitted being frustrated in
the close contest, but softened his tone later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't the happiest guy in the locker room (after the
game),'' Gailey said. ``I need to put in perspective that we won
the game. I don't want the players to feel bad about winning a
game. I told the team some things I wish I could take back. The
object is to win. Were we perfect? No. Do I wish we had played
better? Yes. But we won. And if the rest of the games go like this
one, that'll suit me just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey reported no major injuries Monday. Emmitt Smith and
receiver Billy Davis will be limited in practice this week because
of a hip bruise and foot sprain, respectively, but both will play
Sunday at Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey also said he is ``99 percent certain'' that injured
quarterback Troy Aikman will not return until the Nov. 2 game at
Philadelphia.

 &HT;    Mandatory withdrawals might prove to be painless
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Here's good news for retirees who must make mandatory
withdrawals from retirement accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s:
</P>
<P>
   You don't necessarily have to sell your stocks or other assets
and make the withdrawals in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Many people, including some professional financial advisers,
have assumed transfers out of those tax-deferred accounts must be
in cash.
</P>
<P>
   That left both retirees and advisers groping for the best move
in a sinking stock market. Is a retiree compelled to sell some
stock, even if it means he or she must take a loss? Is there a way
to dodge into another investment, or to limit the amount they must
sell? Is there a way to avoid the problem in future years?
</P>
<P>
   Ellen O. Keller, a certified financial planner in Roswell,
provided the basic answer: In many plans, the problem just doesn't
exist. If you don't want to sell a stock, just tell your account
manager to transfer the stock from your IRA to a brokerage account.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a perfect solution. ``You'll have to declare the value
of the stock as taxable income,'' Keller said. ``You have to come
up with money for the taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it universally available.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's legal, but it is not a required option,'' said Randall W.
Eidson, a group vice president at SunTrust Securities. In a 401(k),
the employer who sets up the plan can decide whether to allow
``in-kind'' rather than cash withdrawals, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He has helped numerous small businesses set up their 401(k)s,
and those typically authorize withdrawals of securities. But you'll
have to check with the corporate office that administers your plan
to be sure, he added.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a self-directed plan _ an IRA, for example _ you
still need to check the rules. ``Then it's a question of whether
your service provider _ SunTrust or Fidelity or whoever _ will
allow you to do it,'' Eidson said.
</P>
<P>
   Mandatory withdrawals are an element of most tax-deferred
retirement plans, with the exception of Roth IRAs. The requirement
kicks in shortly after the owner of the account passes the age of
70 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   There are several methods for establishing how much you must
withdraw each year. Each of them is based on standard tables of
life expectancy for the owner and the beneficiary of the plan, said
Bob Bordett, a certified financial planner in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   He worked out an example, using the most commonly selected
method for establishing a minimum withdrawal: Suppose the owner of
an IRA is 71 and the beneficiary is 67. Their combined life
expectancy comes to 21.7 years. If they have $50,000 in the
account, they would be required to withdraw a minimum of $2,305
this year, Bordett said.
</P>
<P>
   The amount must be recalculated each year to account for the
couple's increasing age. Next year, this hypothetical couple would
have to take out at least $2,404.
</P>
<P>
   If another couple of the same ages had $650,000 in an IRA, the
first-year withdrawal would have to be $29,954.
</P>
<P>
   If you are looking ahead to next year, Bordett recommends
putting a portion of your retirement account into money market
funds or other cash equivalents.
</P>
<P>
   For those who intend to pass some of their retirement plan
investments along to children or grandchildren, certified financial
planner Steve McConihay recommends stashing some assets in a
separate IRA with the child named as the beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   That changes the calculation, since the beneficiary's age will
be much less than, say, a spouse's age. When calculating a minimum
withdrawal, the Internal Revenue Service allows a maximum spread of
10 years between the ages of the owner and the beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   Is any of this worth messing with? It depends on how big a
withdrawal you have to make and how much of a loss you might have
to take by selling stocks. In Bordett's second example, with nearly
$30,000 at stake, it would certainly be worth checking out your
alternatives.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Seeing Paris through the eyes of
Texas
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By JOE MURRAY
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ I'm picking up the tab for an oyster dinner but, still,
Kyle Jarrard is paying a price.
</P>
<P>
   This is the night that French TV shows ``Star Trek.'' Kyle, an
old friend and a Texan to boot, says he'd rather have dinner with
me.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle, a novelist, says a lot of things.
</P>
<P>
   In his recently completed novel, his third in the last several
years, Kyle says what he actually thinks of France, where he has
lived and written since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Roundabouts _ what my people call traffic circles _ feature
prominently.
</P>
<P>
   The book, ``Bastille Day Weekend,'' centers on a village in
France (not unlike the one where the family of Kyle's French wife
owns a country home) and symbolizes ``everything that's wrong with
France,'' the author says.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it has become the village of the dammed, ever
since a government project diverted the river and, as a result of
the dam, polluted its waters.
</P>
<P>
   As for the roundabout, the book version of the village never had
need for so much as one traffic circle. Now, thanks to corrupt
politics and payoffs by contractors to local officials, dozens
surround the little town.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the book's plot is a terrorist plan to dynamite
the dam during Bastille Day weekend, though this French legion of
inept anarchists is more humorous than murderous.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the basis of the story. Such, for its author, is the
basis of his problem with publishers.
</P>
<P>
   His French agent's initial reaction was that of ``Perplexed.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyle, almost immediately, felt the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perplexed?'' he pondered. ``Is that bad?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm wondering,'' she wondered aloud, ``if the French people
will be insulted.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a political correctioness thing with a French twist.
</P>
<P>
   To wit: Can a foreigner write a book about France without
offending the French?
</P>
<P>
   Kyle, who is in his early 40s and an editor at the International
Herald Tribune, thinks he has paid his French dues, and then some,
over the past 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   He is married to a French woman. Their children are growing up
more French than American. They are even in the process of
investing in a home.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about French dues. Talk about Paris real estate.
</P>
<P>
   A three bedroom, one bath home in a subdivision of lots closer
to the size of burial plots costs in the neighborhood of $350,000.
And it's not even that good of a neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have muddy little yards, and some of the walls even touch
each other at the property lines,'' Kyle muttered.
</P>
<P>
   So it is, in fact, that he and his family find themselves
thinking more and more of Texas where there's plenty of wide open
spaces, though about the same density of closed minds.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle's first novel, ``Over There,'' which takes place in Paris,
Texas, (though not Paris, Texas) and Mexico was a puzzlement for
more than a few critics.
</P>
<P>
   Some found it incomprehensible, and I liked it a lot.
</P>
<P>
   His second novel, ``Down In There,'' mostly about Mexico, is
being shopped around by Kyle's agents, so far without success.
</P>
<P>
   One must wonder:
</P>
<P>
   Can a Texan living in Paris write a novel about Mexico without
offending the island nation of Seychelles in the Indian Ocean?
</P>
<P>
   It's a marketing thing. You wouldn't understand.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. We'll always have Paris. And right now I think I'll
have another plate of oysters, Paris style.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Vivian Bearing, at age 50 a professor of 17th-century
poetry, has devoted her life to the ``Holy Sonnets'' of John Donne.
She holds the sort of Ph.D. that restores some sense of academic
majesty to the honorific of doctor, now most frequently used by
radio and television people who tell us whether the sun is in or
out.
</P>
<P>
   Vivian's concerns are a bit more cerebral: the line by line,
word by word, comma by comma investigation of the work of a poet
who jousts with God using wit, paradox, philosophical speculation
and dialectics to get at the meaning of life. The poet never wins;
his dazzling sonnets are ends in themselves.
</P>
<P>
   When first met in ``Wit,'' Margaret Edson's fine play now at the
Off Broadway MCC Theater, Vivian is wearing a hospital gown of an
institutional size and flimsiness to deny any patient's
individuality. Her only distinguishing feature: a cherry-red
baseball cap that doesn't quite hide her bald head. She has the
beaky, hollow-eyed look of a large handsome chicken that has been
plucked too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Right at the start of ``Wit,'' it is apparent that Vivian values
words too much to waste them. ``It is not my intention to give away
the plot,'' she tells the audience with mock humility, ``but I
think I die at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   She does die at the end but, for the next two hours that pass in
a wink, the audience is treated to the kind of theatrical
experience of which legends are made. We come to know and
appreciate the mind and substance of this singular character and of
the playwright who conceived her, as well as the ravishing
potential of the singular actress who plays Vivian: Kathleen
Chalfant. You have seen Ms. Chalfant in many productions, usually
in support of other people; you probably remember her best as the
mother in Tony Kushner's ``Angels in America.'' In ``Wit,'' Ms.
Chalfant becomes a star, triumphing in the role of her career.
</P>
<P>
   Vivian has advanced metastatic ovarian cancer, identified as
Stage Four (there is no Stage Five). In the course of the play, she
is undergoing a cycle of still-experimental chemotherapy, which
requires that she be hospitalized for up to a week out of every
four over an eight-month period. It is a horrendous assault on the
body and the psyche.
</P>
<P>
   Her constitution, which is that of an ox, astonishes the
doctors. She is Exhibit A in their daily rounds as they talk over
and around her, observing, feeling and probing. ``It's just like a
graduate seminar,'' she says. ``Once I did the teaching; now I am
taught.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor she sees most often is Jason (Alec Phoenix), a bright
young clinical fellow on the oncology team in charge of her case.
By chance, he had taken her course in 17th-century poetry. He had
no interest in Donne, but he wanted to prove to himself that he
could earn an A (he actually got an A minus) in one of the toughest
courses the university offered. In a play of more commonplace
goals, a sentimental bond might be established between the patient
and her whiz-kid doctor. Not in ``Wit.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a relationship, but it is one-sided: the increasingly
introspective Vivian slowly recognizes in Jason the same kind of
ruthless, utterly impersonal obsession with knowledge that
propelled her own career. The only difference is that his field is
cancer research. Theirs are ruthless obsessions, perhaps, but not
worthless. They might even be called magnificent, the word used by
Lloyd C. Douglas in the title of one of his sudsy romantic novels
in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly the play's toughest, most moving confrontation is
prompted by Jason's impatience with Vivian's attempts to be
something other than a textbook case in his eyes. He doesn't
apologize; he more or less admits that she is. He says that med
school courses in bedside manners are a waste of time for
researchers. When she continues to question him as to how cancer
became his subject, he suspects that she is experiencing new
symptoms: mental confusion, maybe even memory loss.
</P>
<P>
   She persists in her probing of him. More for his own
satisfaction than hers, he begins to talk about the profound
mysteries of cancer, sounding almost like a poet. Healthy cells, he
explains, can be grown in the lab in a tissue culture, but they
eventually conk out. Cancer cells are something else. They will
replicate forever. It is called ``immortality in culture.'' Says
Vivian: ``It sounds like a symposium.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edson has her own remarkable feeling for words. Her
accomplishment as playwright has been to take the life of a woman
who never married, who had no lovers (as least none that still
haunt her dreams) and who has no family, whose focus is narrow if
deep, and create a big, strong character of enormous range and
theatrical interest.
</P>
<P>
   In flashbacks we meet briefly but importantly her father (Walter
Charles) and the professor, Dr. Ashford (Helen Stenborg), who
initially taught Vivian the need for discipline and precision when
dealing with Donne. Dr. Ashford is especially scathing about
``inauthentically punctuated'' Donne texts, what with their
``hysterical'' semicolons and exclamation points. A wonderfully
grave and wise eccentric of 80, she returns toward the end of the
play to read to the now heavily sedated Vivian. The scene, which
could have been bathetic, is a killer.
</P>
<P>
   As superlatively directed by Derek Anson Jones, ``Wit'' is
presented without an intermission, mostly in a series of hospital
settings. These are speedily, minimally indicated by the use of the
sort of hospital curtains that promise the patient a privacy never
remotely achieved.
</P>
<P>
   The supporting cast is without flaw, but note particularly the
work of Ms. Stenborg, Phoenix and Paula Pizzi, who plays the
primary nurse of the cancer in-patient unit, the only person, aside
from Dr. Ashford, who sees Vivian as the custodian of her own
idiosyncratic soul.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chalfant inhabits the play from beginning to end. She is
never off the stage. The performance proceeds seamlessly as a
series of revelations while layers of Vivian's character are
discovered, acknowledged and stripped away, until, at last, all
Vivian can say is, ``Now is the time for simplicity.'' There is no
ego left. After that, there is little thought of Donne, doctors,
hospital routine or even the past. What remains of the present is
consumed in the battle with pain, leading, ultimately, to a final
stage image that at first shocks and then seems inevitably,
supremely right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wit'' is the first play by Ms. Edson, who is an elementary
school teacher in Atlanta. Where will she go now, having made such
an astonishing debut? ``Wit'' has taken some time to reach New
York. It was first produced by South Coast Repertory in California
in 1995. The current production, which originated last fall at the
Long Wharf Theater in New Haven, began performances in New York on
Sept. 13 for a four-week run, now extended through Nov. 22. It
would seem to promise good things to come from the Long Wharf under
Doug Hughes, who succeeded Arvin Brown as the artistic director in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wit'' is tough but it is not a downer. It is too intelligent
and vibrantly theatrical for that. Also, don't mistake it for the
kind of fatal-disease weepies Hollywood turns out with regularity.
It is as sentimental as a CAT scan. Though it has a number of
witty, sarcastic lines, it never pretends to find redeeming humor
in despair, nor does it celebrate some comforting, all-purpose
faith, either ongoing or opportunely reclaimed. ``Wit'' identifies
death with the way that, according to Dr. Ashford, the use of a
comma gives all-encompassing point to the last line of one of the
most often quoted of the ``Holy Sonnets'': ``And death shall be no
more, Death thou shalt die.''
</P>
<P>
   Death, says Donne, is a slight pause, between life and life
everlasting. `Corpus Christi'

 NEW YORK: ``Corpus Christi.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Terrence McNally's ``Corpus Christi,'' now at the Manhattan
Theater Club, is a thoroughly professional production: the work of
an accomplished playwright, directed by Joe Mantello, the man
responsible for the staging of McNally's bracing, neo-Chekhovian
``Love! Valour! Compassion!'' at the same theater in 1994. The
actors are eager and, occasionally, able.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the entire production has the teeth-grinding earnestness of
an amateur theatrical put on by a neighborhood encounter group.
Talk about raised consciousnesses! This is a gay-oriented
``Greatest Story Ever Told,'' in which the Passion of Jesus has all
of the mystery of a ``Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' put on by a
bunch of fellows who appear to shop at the Gap. There are many
lines that are meant to be funny, and a lot more that are
unintentional hoots.
</P>
<P>
   True, the language is raunchy. And on a Saturday night, after a
long week of doing good works and, maybe, digging the beatitudes of
the Sermon on the Mount, they like to dance up a storm, sometimes
getting very, very drunk. Even Joshua, which is the character name
for the Snow White (or Jesus) role.
</P>
<P>
   After his first sexual encounter with Judas, and later, after
the Miracle of the Loaves and Fishes, when he gets it on with
Simon, Joshua solemnly tells his partner: ``You can come no closer
to me than your body. Everything else you will never touch.
Everything important is hidden from you.'' The disciples being just
guys, after all, that's good enough for them.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to know what McNally has in mind. To celebrate
the compatibility of Christian beliefs and gay life? To point out
the hypocrisy of much Christian practice in relation to gay
believers? To state the obvious?
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to be able to defend ``Corpus Christi'' in view
of the pre-opening threats designed to abort the production, and
the later sidewalk demonstrations, which were meant to intimidate
the theater as well as audiences. The show, unhappily, is a fizzle;
defensible, yes, but only on the grounds of the First Amendment.
Art has nothing to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   Another nonstarter is Dare Clubb's ``Oedipus,'' a deconstructed
adaptation of the Oedipus saga, which takes four hours to work wan,
anachronistic variations on the story we mainly know from
Sophocles' ``Oedipus Rex'' and ``Oedipus at Colonus.'' Presented by
the usually astute Blue Light Theater Company, the exhausting,
often ineptly croaked production is at the CSC Theater, staged by
the author with unwarranted love and admiration.
</P>
<P>
   Clubb's main conceit is that Oedipus (Billy Crudup) goes to the
oracle at Delphi as a young man, still living in Corinth with his
(unknown to him) foster parents, King Polybus and Queen Merope.
Told that his fate is to murder his father and marry his mother,
the impressionable teen-ager, eager to honor the gods, rushes home
and slays Polybus, only to learn that he, Oedipus, is a foundling.
The poor kid has to start all over.
</P>
<P>
   This much could be a rather funny revue sketch, suitable for
presentation at year-end faculty revels. It is, unfortunately, no
more than the first hour of Clubb's ``Oedipus,'' which unravels
like a slow-motion ``Odyssey'' as Oedipus tries to go home again to
the natural parents he doesn't remember. Adventures of mounting
inconsequence accumulate and, by the end of the fourth hour,
confusion reigns, leaving the audience more exhausted than even the
actors.
</P>
<P>
   Clubb is no wordsmith, or maybe he is and that's the problem.
Writing in a poetic vein, he produces intentionally overstuffed
lines that sound as if they had been decorated by Laura Ashley. Put
in a reference to a babbling brook here, hang a simile associating
something to a starry night there. His blunt anachronisms are even
sillier.
</P>
<P>
   There is his peculiar fondness for the word copulate, as
something done by kings, queens and common people. The word stands
out, for a purpose maybe, but without point in dialogue that
otherwise makes free use of other contemporary vulgarisms. You
might think he was writing about meerkats.
</P>
<P>
   The cast also includes the Oscar-winner Frances McDormand, who
plays both Merope and the Sphinx to no great advantage. Like
everyone else in the cast, she spends much of the time rolling
around on the stage floor or walking on her knees, like Jose Ferrer
in ``Moulin Rouge.''
</P>
<P>
   The play ends with a crucifixion. If, like me, you had seen
``Corpus Christi'' the night before, that's at least one
crucifixion too many in a single week.
</P>

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Seeing Paris through the eyes of
Texas
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By JOE MURRAY
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ I'm picking up the tab for an oyster dinner but, still,
Kyle Jarrard is paying a price.
</P>
<P>
   This is the night that French TV shows ``Star Trek.'' Kyle, an
old friend and a Texan to boot, says he'd rather have dinner with
me.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle, a novelist, says a lot of things.
</P>
<P>
   In his recently completed novel, his third in the last several
years, Kyle says what he actually thinks of France, where he has
lived and written since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Roundabouts _ what my people call traffic circles _ feature
prominently.
</P>
<P>
   The book, ``Bastille Day Weekend,'' centers on a village in
France (not unlike the one where the family of Kyle's French wife
owns a country home) and symbolizes ``everything that's wrong with
France,'' the author says.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it has become the village of the dammed, ever
since a government project diverted the river and, as a result of
the dam, polluted its waters.
</P>
<P>
   As for the roundabout, the book version of the village never had
need for so much as one traffic circle. Now, thanks to corrupt
politics and payoffs by contractors to local officials, dozens
surround the little town.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the book's plot is a terrorist plan to dynamite
the dam during Bastille Day weekend, though this French legion of
inept anarchists is more humorous than murderous.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the basis of the story. Such, for its author, is the
basis of his problem with publishers.
</P>
<P>
   His French agent's initial reaction was that of ``Perplexed.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyle, almost immediately, felt the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perplexed?'' he pondered. ``Is that bad?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm wondering,'' she wondered aloud, ``if the French people
will be insulted.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a political correctioness thing with a French twist.
</P>
<P>
   To wit: Can a foreigner write a book about France without
offending the French?
</P>
<P>
   Kyle, who is in his early 40s and an editor at the International
Herald Tribune, thinks he has paid his French dues, and then some,
over the past 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   He is married to a French woman. Their children are growing up
more French than American. They are even in the process of
investing in a home.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about French dues. Talk about Paris real estate.
</P>
<P>
   A three bedroom, one bath home in a subdivision of lots closer
to the size of burial plots costs in the neighborhood of $350,000.
And it's not even that good of a neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have muddy little yards, and some of the walls even touch
each other at the property lines,'' Kyle muttered.
</P>
<P>
   So it is, in fact, that he and his family find themselves
thinking more and more of Texas where there's plenty of wide open
spaces, though about the same density of closed minds.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle's first novel, ``Over There,'' which takes place in Paris,
Texas, (though not Paris, Texas) and Mexico was a puzzlement for
more than a few critics.
</P>
<P>
   Some found it incomprehensible, and I liked it a lot.
</P>
<P>
   His second novel, ``Down In There,'' mostly about Mexico, is
being shopped around by Kyle's agents, so far without success.
</P>
<P>
   One must wonder:
</P>
<P>
   Can a Texan living in Paris write a novel about Mexico without
offending the island nation of Seychelles in the Indian Ocean?
</P>
<P>
   It's a marketing thing. You wouldn't understand.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. We'll always have Paris. And right now I think I'll
have another plate of oysters, Paris style.

   THEN AND NOW: CHANGES SINCE THE 1973 ARAB OIL EMBARGO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Imports, 28 percent of total U.S. oil consumption in 1973,
have risen to 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC), which supplied 54 percent of the world's crude oil, now
provide 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Inflation-adjusted retail prices have risen 6.5 percent for
gasoline and 7 percent for electricity in those 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The inflation-adjusted price paid by refiners for crude oil
has risen by 58 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The inflation-adjusted price of natural gas as it comes out of
the ground has increased by 187 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  U.S. consumption of petroleum is up by 13 percent, though the
nation's growing population means that on a per-person basis, it is
down by 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Improved exploration and development technology has cut the
cost of finding new oil and gas wells by 68 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The average car then got 14 miles per gallon, compared to
today's 28.5 miles per gallon for a car and 20.4 miles per gallon
for light trucks -- including minivans, sport utility vehicles and
small pickups.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Today's average car or light truck has 25 percent more
horsepower than its equivalent in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The 31 percent share of homes heated by oil has dropped to 17
percent. The main reason: The 54 percent share of new homes heated
by natural gas has risen to 69 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Electric utilities, which got 17 percent of their power from
oil before the embargo, get only 2.5 percent from oil today.
Natural gas, then 18 percent of fuel for utilities, fell to 9.5
percent. To make up the difference, coal rose from 46 percent to
nearly 57 percent of utility fuel, and nuclear rose from 4.5
percent to about about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  While U.S. energy consumption has increased by 27 percent
since the embargo, energy use has grown so much faster in other
countries that the U.S. share of the world's energy consumption has
dropped from 31 percent in 1973 to 25 percent today.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Twenty-five years ago, Arab countries around the
Persian Gulf started an oil embargo that shattered Americans'
complacency over the security of their energy supply.
</P>
<P>
   The artificial oil shortage that began on Oct. 18, 1973, led to
six months of agonizing and improvising by government officials and
drivers desperate to find a service station that still had gas.
</P>
<P>
   In the next quarter-century, the federal government spent more
than $90 billion looking for ways to reduce our reliance on foreign
oil.
</P>
<P>
   Today, over-production and faltering demand from developing
countries has created a worldwide glut of oil. Half the oil
consumed in the United States -- or roughly one-fifth of the
nation's total energy supply -- is imported from Mexico, Canada and
other foreign lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Americans have apparently forgotten about that crisis of
25 years ago,'' said Cecile Warner, who has not. An engineer who
directs the federal Center for Renewable Energy Resources in
Golden, Colo., she designed, built and lives in ``a passive solar
home that uses less than one-third of the energy of a home built to
today's standards.''
</P>
<P>
   New energy efficiencies have cut petroleum use per person. But
expensive efforts to develop clean, non-nuclear alternatives to
fossil fuels have failed to come up with a product cheap enough to
compete with deregulated oil and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than half our oil now is imported, compared to only a
little more than one-third before the embargo, and that figure is
expected to rise to about two-thirds by 2020,'' Warner cautioned.
``Average vehicle miles per gallon are decreasing because of the
popularity of sport -utility vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, today's SUVs and other light trucks average more than 20
miles per gallon -- while the average car or pick-up of 1973 burned
up a gallon every 14 miles.
</P>
<P>
   That may be one reason why few Americans even noticed the three
price-propping production cutbacks announced in the last 10 months
by the the Arab and non-Arab countries in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   OPEC's first two cutbacks flopped. The third, announced in June,
might be taking hold. After sliding from $25 a barrel in October
1996 to under $14 in August, the world price for crude oil has
bobbed up to around $16 in the last two months. The two-dollar jump
translates to about a nickel a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Sales from new suppliers dilute any cutback's effects. ``Russia,
the Caspian Sea region, Asia, West Africa and Latin America'' are
the industry's new frontiers, said Michael Cates, chief economist
of the American Petroleum Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond this, our vulnerability to such disruptions has been
significantly reduced by the development of the (federal) Strategic
Petroleum Reserve,'' Cates said. The reserve's storage pits hold
enough crude oil to make up for the loss of all U.S. imports for
about 60 days -- longer in the more likely event that only part of
the imports are blocked. The reserve system worked well in 1990
during and after the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   But the 1973 embargo was another story. The Saudis announced
that if the United States continued supporting Israel militarily,
it wouldn't be allowed to buy Arab oil.
</P>
<P>
   That threat was issued just one day after 11 Arab nations agreed
in Kuwait City to raise the charge for their oil by 17 percent and
prop up the new price by cutting their production by five percent
each month.
</P>
<P>
   Defying the economic and political threat, the United States
continued to re-supply the Israelis as they drove back the
Soviet-supplied armies of Syria and Egypt, which had invaded Israel
earlier in the month on the solemn Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur.
</P>
<P>
   Public confidence in American leaders was sinking that month, as
Vice President Spiro Agnew was forced to resign and President
Richard Nixon ordered the firing of the Watergate special
prosecutor. In addition, an elaborate system of price and wage
controls had failed to prevent heating-oil shortages the previous
winter and disruptions of the gasoline supply that summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recall consumers following our delivery trucks and when the
truck arrived at the station, it would be trailing a ready-made
line of cars waiting for gas,'' said Leo Liebowitz, president and
CEO of Getty Oil, an independent oil marketer on Long Island, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pumping about 52,000 gallons a month, but as soon as
the embargo hit, I was cut back to 26,000,'' remembered station
owner Larry Beattie of Augusta, Ga. ``I think the oil companies and
the government, both of them, overdid it, and, of course, there was
a little abuse of the situation by some people on the side.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   Station closings were most common in Florida, Georgia, the
Carolinas and Tennessee. ``We'd have 70 to 100 dealers who'd spend
their own money to go up to Washington and lobby for relief,'' said
Jack Houston, retired executive director of the Georgia Association
of Petroleum Retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers who used to wait until their gas tank was three-quarters
empty began refilling when their tank was three-quarters full.
``Better safe than sorry,'' said Lois Epstein's grandfather, when
she asked why they were lined up to buy gasoline for the second day
in a row. Multiplied by millions of motorists, that precaution
drained oil terminals, tank farms and refineries of surpluses that
could have eased the pain.
</P>
<P>
   Epstein, now a senior engineer with the Environmental Defense
Fund, said she worries that oil today is so cheap and plentiful
that careless companies lack economic incentives to fix leaky
equipment that could contaminate water or soil.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   At the embargo's peak, crude oil imports dropped by 17 percent.
The 38-cent average price for gasoline jumped to 54 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter, a governor who three years later would be elected
president, asked Georgia's state employes to save electricity by
using the stairs instead of the elevators at work.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Americans heeded Nixon's pleas to turn down their
home and office thermostats to 68 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines conserved jet fuel by packing more passengers onto
fewer flights. They overbooked so heavily that when consumer
advocate Ralph Nader was bumped, a federal district judge ordered
the airline to pay him $25,100.
</P>
<P>
   The big neon signs in front of motels blinked off. Nixon parked
Air Force One and caught a commercial flight to his home in
California. That year, the lights on the national Christmas tree
erected outside the White House each December were kept turned off.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices stayed up, and Israel reached a truce with Syria and
Egypt. Missions accomplished, the Arabs halted their embargo in
March 1974.
</P>
<P>
   But many older Americans still suspect it was all a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knew what was going on,'' recalled Lee Ramsnyder, who
operated the Lan-Mar Marina on Georgia's Lake Lanier. ``I remember
hearing there was a secret supply in Louisiana or someplace like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We pumped most of our gas to boaters on weekends, and we kept
running out by Sunday afternoon,'' he said. ``I think maybe a lot
of it was done by the government to pull us out of a little
recession by making people back up a bit on fuel use and dig in.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ramsnyder rebuilds used tour buses, installs luxuries
ranging from stoves and showers to trash compactors, and then sells
the vehicles to entertainers and other travelers who don't care
that they only get about eight miles to the gallon.

<P>
   KUWAIT CITY, Kuwait _ There has never been so much available
oil, which is good news for motorists at gas pumps just about
everywhere -- but here.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices are dropping. So, nervous officials in this oil-rich
sheikhdom might raise the price of gasoline in their own land to
raise money for the government-sponsored lifestyle of free
health-care, full employment and air-conditioned comfort.
</P>
<P>
   High-priced gasoline would be a reversal of fortune for Kuwait.
It's oil reserves make up nearly one-tenth of the world's supply
and gushes up through drill holes to the desert surface without the
pumps needed elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks odd and peculiar that, at a time when many countries
are cutting the prices at the gas stations, you're increasing it in
Kuwait,'' said Kuwaiti Oil Minister Saud Nasir Al-Sabah in a recent
interview with Cox News Service. ``That's absurd . . . I don't
think this is something that's acceptable to us now.''
</P>
<P>
   Life is still good here. Car dealerships are busy every night
and young Kuwaitis can still count on a job in the bloated
government bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   But Kuwait and its oil-producing neighbors, from wealthy Saudi
Arabia to giant and volatile Iran, are struggling with the
ramifications of low oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, the so-called Arab oil embargo shocked
the West. Attempting to keep the U.S. from backing Israel, these
countries threatened to cut oil supplies -- particularly to the
U.S., where frightened Americans rushed to line up their
gas-guzzling automobiles at pumps despite rising prices.
</P>
<P>
   The panic in the West brought a windfall in the Gulf, which
became awash in cash as well as oil. Big countries like Iran and
Iraq could bring their people modern social services, roads and
education. Small countries, like Kuwait, could luxuriate.
</P>
<P>
   It raised the gulf countries' world clout. Arabic became an
official language at the United Nations. The United States started
selling sophisticated military airplanes to the Saudis.
</P>
<P>
   But, prompted by the higher prices, new competition in oil
production took off from Mexico to Russia. And, oil importers --
especially the United States -- found ways to conserve.
</P>
<P>
   Today, oil prices are about as low, adjusted for inflation, as
they were before the embargo in 1973. More oil is produced than
ever -- 73 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   So, while Persian Gulf oil exporters still sit on 65 percent of
the world's supply, it is losing value. The 11-member OPEC cartel
(including three nations outside the Mideast) will see revenues
drop by a third this year -- down about $40 billion. Since 1980,
the per capita income in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and three other
oil-producing monarchies has dropped by more than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A continued decline in oil prices could cause hard times here,
leading to radicalism -- or worse, instability -- even among
stalwart American allies like Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Kuwait has just 1.8 million inhabitants and nearly 10 percent
of the world's oil. But, Kuwaitis are edgy about the soundness of a
system that provides free health-care, subsidized utilities and
charges no income or sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More vulnerable is Saudi Arabia, with about 18 million people.
It is also cutting back benefits -- like the low-income housing
loans for newlyweds -- while trying to calm a restless minority of
have-nots and religious fundamentalists. Unemployment is rising.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More volatile still is Iran. A regional giant with 68 million
people, Iran's government deficit and economic recession could
undercut nascent steps toward detente with the West.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Iraq is another story. Its oil production has been limited by
economic sanctions and industrial disrepair following the Persian
Gulf War. But, should things improve -- and Russia and China have
their way -- its production will kick into gear and add to the oil
glut.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Zalmay Khalilzad, director for Strategic Studies at the Rand
Corp., warns that the United States is still dependent on Persian
Gulf oil supplies. If Americans want low prices, he said, they may
have to be ready to help quell the resulting unrest in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The oil producers tend to make the problem worse. Most have
refused to make tough cuts in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gulf countries, unfortunately, are still dreaming that the
welfare state will last forever,'' said Kuwaiti political scientist
Shamlan al-Essa(CQ).
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they just try to raise money by pumping and selling
more oil. That lowers the price even more.
</P>
<P>
   Far from controlling the market, OPEC members now are struggling
just to keep their organization together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole situation is very different than it was in the
past,'' Al Sabah said. ``We have to be extremely careful about
mixing oil and politics.''

<P>
   BEIJING _ Oil barons around the world, take heart: China's leap
toward prosperity has caused nearly 1 million families to switch
from bicycles to cars.
</P>
<P>
   By itself, the coming of the car culture to China isn't going to
shock the world's oil markets, as did the Arab oil embargo of
1973-74.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Chinese private car phenomenon should gain momentum
in the next few years just when the rest of Asia is soaring back
from its current economic crisis, the combined impact on world oil
prices could be dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   The simple mechanism of supply-and-demand could slowly crimp the
world oil market in much the same way as members of OPEC did in the
oil cartel's heyday, when they agreed to cut production quotas --
and then stuck to the rules. Gradually, oil would become less
available and the price would go up.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the number of private cars in China has jumped from
virtually zero five years ago to at least 699,000, according to a
report by the China Automobile Market Survey and Research Society.
China's auto makers are now increasing the production of passenger
sedans by 15 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the year 2000, there will be at least 1 million privately
owned vehicles in China's cities,'' the research society declared.
``In major municipalities and provincial capitals, the ownership
rate among families will reach five(CQ) percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, since 1996 China has ``trimmed'' the production of
bicycles, the China Light Industry News reported last month. It
attributed the fall-off to ``shrinking market demand'' and
``accelerated development of the automobile industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Though affluence is on the rise in China, the rest of Asia is in
a deep recession. This has flattened Asia's spectacular 5
percent-a-year growth in oil consumption that generally kept world
prices above $24 a barrel throughout the 1980s. When Asia's energy
demand sagged last year, world oil prices slid by this summer to
below $11 a barrel, their lowest level (on an inflation-adjusted
basis) since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, almost every expert believes that Asian oil demand will
start to rebound fairly soon. When that happens, it will probably
spell the end of cheap gasoline around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Writing this March in the American journal ``Foreign Affairs,''
world oil experts Daniel Yergin, Dennis Eklof and Jefferson Edwards
predicted that overall Asian energy consumption ``will again rise
sharply in two or three years'' -- once Japan and its neighbors
solve their internal economic woes.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in the lowest trough of the Asian economic doldrums,
Asian countries consume about 19 million barrels of oil a day.
That's just over one-fourth of the oil that is used worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Oil fields in Asia produce just 8 million barrels for Asia's
daily needs; the remaining 11 million barrels a day must be
imported. Three-fourths of Asia's imported petroleum comes from the
Persian Gulf, with Saudi Arabia by far the largest supplier.
</P>
<P>
   ``In sum, the prospects for Asia's oil supply look decidedly
grim,'' wrote Yergin, Eklof and Edwards. ``By 2010, (Asian)
productive capacity will have declined 6 percent from its 2005
peak, with new oil field developments unable to compensate for
maturing Indonesian, Malaysian and Australian fields. So regardless
of exploration, Asia is destined to import more than 20 million
barrels of oil per day by 2010, compared with approximately 11
million today.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   China is the newest and fastest-growing customer for Middle East
oil. Until five years ago, China was proud of its status as an
``energy-independent'' oil exporter. But thanks to its own meteoric
economic growth, China now imports 25 percent of its oil, amounting
to 1 million barrels a day. So far, most is for industrial uses and
only a small fraction for private cars.
</P>
<P>
   China derives another 3 million barrels a day of oil from
domestic oil wells while obtaining the balance of its energy from
massive reliance on coal, and hydro-electric and a few nuclear
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Most of China's imported oil now comes from Saudi Arabia, Iran
and the United Arab Emirates. Determined to diversify its oil
sources beyond the Persian Gulf, China's national petroleum
corporation last year outbid some of the biggest Western oil
companies for the right to help develop some of the choicest
Caspian Sea Basin oil properties in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   Still, China's steep increases in oil imports worries some
Chinese energy experts. Early last year retired scientists Yang
Jike, the former vice president of China's national environmental
protection committee, published a warning that it was better to
rely
</P>
<P>
   on coal than imported oil.
</P>
<P>
   If China allowed its oil imports to increase, ``China will get
entangled in Middle East politics, like the United States,'' Yang
wrote.

   MEXICO CITY _ When the price of crude oil falls, it's happy days
for American consumers and the U.S. economy. But those same price
cuts strike fear in the hearts of Mexicans and Venezuelans, now
critical exporters of oil to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil dominates the economies of Latin America's biggest
producers. And every time prices fall, big cuts in federal spending
and economic crisis are sure to follow.
</P>
<P>
   The ties that bind the U.S. and its Latin American suppliers
have grown strong since the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s, part of
a promise by the U.S. to diversify and avoid oil dependence on one
region.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, for example, is expected to supply the U.S. with 13.4
percent of its imported oil in 1998. That's up from 1.2 percent in
1975. In 1985 Mexico's share of U.S. oil imports hit a high of more
than 16 percent, then dropped a bit before rising again this year.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   The growth of mutual dependency between the United States and
Mexico is ironic, given how jealously Mexico guards its national
resources. In Mexico, the day that oil was nationalized in 1938 is
still celebrated as a moment of civic pride, and suggestions that
privatizing the nation's oil industry to make it more efficient
always prompts a flurry of angry denunciations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, not all of Mexico's oil was sold to the United
States,'' said John Lichtbleu, an analyst with Pira Energy Group in
New York. ``There was a time when they didn't want to sell more
than 50 percent of exports to the U.S. because of a fear of
domination. Now 85 to 90 percent of Mexican exported oil goes to
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   While the northward flow helps stabilize the Mexican economy, it
also means demand and price fluctuations have a greater impact on
average Mexicans. About 33 percent of the country's federal revenue
comes from Petroleos de Mexico -- Pemex -- the government's oil
company.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   That's a dependency Mexico has tried hard to shake. A decade
ago, oil money made up 45 percent of the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   And oil used to be Mexico's number one export, drawing three out
of every four dollars worth of foreign capital flowing into the
country. Today, as Mexico has built up its manufacturing base, oil
accounts for only 5.4 percent of the foreign revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the economy and the national budget are highly vulnerable
to the ups and downs of international oil prices. Three times this
year Mexican government officials made emergency budget spending
cuts to make up for oil revenue shortfalls. More cuts are expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico will have to operate next year with an austere budget
and somehow depend less on oil revenues,'' said Jonathan Heath, a
Mexico City-based economist. ``That will be tough for a country
like Mexico, where public needs are so great today.''
</P>
<P>
   The bust-and-boom oil price cycles have been even rougher on
Venezuela, who's main crude producer, Petroleos de Venezuela, is
the world's second largest.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela puts out 3 million barrels of crude each day, and
relies on oil to generate 60 percent of its government budget
revenue and 80 percent of its foreign income.
</P>
<P>
   The result: recession and political instability this year as the
price for Venezuelan crude hit a 12-year low; oil revenue is off by
a third; the government has slashed spending by $4 billion; and
bank-loan interest rates have soared to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The chaos has opened the door for protectionist politicians like
Hugo Chavez, a former military leader who headed a failed coup in
1992 against then-president Carlos Andres Perez. Chavez is the
front-runner in the race for presidency, which culminates in a
December vote.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has promised to revisit Venezuela's open-door policy on
outside investments in the nation's oil business -- a move that
could crimp the revenues of dozens of foreign companies that
operate in Venezuela. He's even hinted at cutting back on exports
to rich nations, like the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chavez is really the big unknown and he's got investors
scared,'' said Don Bowles, Latin America director for the Economist
Intelligence Unit, a research firm in London. ``Whether he wins,
and what he decides to do if he does, will shape the country's
economic future and could affect the oil industry.''

BY THE BOOK: BEYOND LIVING BY BEER ALONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: recipe at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By SUZANNE HAMLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've never quite understood the term ``beer drinker.'' Does it
mean someone who drinks only beer, or can you qualify if you also
drink water, wine, coffee, tea and milk? And more, is there
another, new category, the boutique-only beer drinker?
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jackson's book ``Ultimate Beer'' (DK Publishing, $29.95)
should appeal to all three types. Jackson, an engaging British
writer, has already established himself as a _ perhaps THE _ hops
authority, through a number of books and television programs. Burly
and bearded, he has an enthusiasm that is infectious; one would
follow him into a pub or tavern anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Another in the large-format, visually stunning Dorling
Kindersley series of food and beverage books, ``Ultimate Beer'' is
chock full of almost-life-size color photographs of beers from
around the world, and text that is equally cosmopolitan. The author
gives brew-by-brew descriptions of hundreds of beers by aroma,
flavor and finish _ ``look, swirl, sniff, sip'' _ not just as
something to order bellied up to a bar, but as a beverage to match
with food.
</P>
<P>
   His descriptions are so vivid I can understand how well La
Choulette _ a light, spicy beer made in Northern France _ would go
with lamb, or how pleasant it would be to wind up a cold winter's
night with a nightcap of Old Knucklehead, a barley wine-style ale
from the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   There are beers for almost every food and each season, Jackson
contends. Now in his mid-50s, he has spent years pursuing the
perfect match.
</P>
<P>
   The current book includes an intriguing section on cooking with
beer. In the way that recipes often specify a particular wine,
Jackson's recipes call for a particular type of beer. And just as
one might use burgundy in a red-wine stew from that region, Jackson
often matches foods and beers by geography. A ham basted with dark
lager, for instance, calls for a rich, malty dark lager in the
German dunkel or schwarzbier style. (In a basting liquid of dark
lager, the malt sugars caramelize, creating a crust and sweet
flavor.)
</P>
<P>
   A fruitcake recipe calls for a spicy dark beer, which
contributes both moisture and flavor. One for mussels in India pale
ale steams the mussels in a dry, savory and acidic brew from a
shellfish region, the Pacific Northwest. And a recipe for
dark-chocolate truffles with an equally dark rich porter should
convince any doubters. Chocolate and beer? It's astoundingly good.
</P>
<P>
   The author's close attention to complementary flavors not only
is intriguing, but also makes a big difference in the final result.
(Don't bother trying the truffles with a lightweight American
lager, as I did.)
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, incidentally, seems to enjoy cooking as much as he does
drinking. Instead of joining him at a pub, maybe you'd rather
follow him home around supper time.
</P>
<P>
   MUSSELS IN INDIA PALE ALE
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from ``Ultimate Beer'' by Michael Jackson
</P>
<P>
   Time: 15 minutes  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 pounds mussels, cleaned
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1 clove garlic, peeled and crushed
</P>
<P>
   2 medium-size red onions, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   1 1/3 cups India pale ale
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of salt
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of sugar
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   French bread, for serving.
</P>
<P>
   1. Buy mussels cleaned if possible; if not, scrub and rinse them
thoroughly and pull off any barnacles and ``beardy'' attachments.
Make sure mussels are closed.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a large heavy pot, melt butter and, over medium heat, cook
garlic and onions until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the thyme, a cup
of the ale, a third of the parsley, a pinch of salt and sugar, and
some grinds of pepper. Add mussels, and simmer for 10 minutes or
less, until the mussels half open. Remove mussels with a slotted
spoon and set aside. Strain the broth through a sieve, and return
strained broth and mussels to the pan. Add the rest of the ale, and
cook a minute longer, until mussels are fully open. Scoop out
mussels with the slotted spoon, and keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   3. Add the rest of the parsley to the liquid in the pan. Reduce
just a little, then pour the liquid over mussels. Serve in
individual soup bowls with plenty of French bread.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

   MOSCOW _ Think of the world's major oil powers and the first
images likely to come to mind are of Persian Gulf sheikdoms or the
sun-baked Texas plains.
</P>
<P>
   Think vodka and snow, too.
</P>
<P>
   A sizable portion of the world's future oil and natural gas
supplies will come from Russia and other former Soviet republics,
if Western oil companies can get to it.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the Soviet Union seven years ago sparked the
last great oil boom of this century.
</P>
<P>
   Oil giants like Exxon, Amoco, Mobil, Shell, Texaco and British
Petroleum are investing billions of dollars across the continent to
tap oil and gas fields from the Siberian tundra of Russia to the
arid Central Asian plains of Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't be here and ready with this kind money if it
wasn't worth it,'' said Alexander Ordjonikidze of the Sakhalin
Energy Investment Company, a consortium of Shell, Marathon and
several Japanese partners that is set to begin offshore production
next year off Russia's far east coast.
</P>
<P>
   Worthwhile maybe, but it is far from easy.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is the world's second largest energy supplier; it
produces more natural gas than any country in the world and is
third behind Saudi Arabia and the United States in quantities of
oil.
</P>
<P>
   But its teetering economy and aging production facilities have
left its status as an oil and gas giant in a sorry state, pumping
about half the levels it did a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Western oil companies have touted themselves as the solution to
Russia's problem -- with partnerships to help Russia extract its
oil and get it to market.
</P>
<P>
   Yet frustrated oil companies have run up against a snarl of
bureaucracy, unfavorable tax conditions and changing terms of the
production deals by Russian partners who want a bigger stake. With
Russia's economy now in crisis and its market reformers on the
political outs, conditions are not expected to improve soon.
</P>
<P>
   Flat world oil prices and a threat of global recession have
further eliminated the urgency and eagerness to push ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Along the Caspian Sea on Russia's southern fringe, billions of
dollars in deals are going forward in a region with the largest new
oil finds in three decades.
</P>
<P>
   It is hailed as the next great Middle East, and the Caspian Sea
basin -- including the former Soviet republics of Kazakhstan,
Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and the breakaway Russian republic
Chechnya -- could be just that.
</P>
<P>
   The region combines the lucrative and dangerous elements of oil,
political unrest and geopolitical implications as the United
States, Russia and Iran vie for influence there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cliche about the former Soviet Union is it is a place with
lots of problems and lots of opportunities. The problems may now
look bigger than they did two or three years ago, but the oil is
still here,'' said Stephen O'Sullivan, an oil and gas industry
analyst in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the Caspian prizes is the Tengiz oil field in
Kazakhstan. Tengiz potentially could produce more than 1 million
barrels a day -- more than the current yield of Alaska's Prudhoe
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   But how to get the oil from the Caspian basin to market has been
a source of diplomatic frustration and intrigue. Russia, Iran and
the United States have differing alternatives for pipelines to the
West.
</P>
<P>
   In the far east, an estimated 2.5 billion barrels of oil and 400
billion cubic meters of natural gas lie under the waters around
Sakhalin Island.
</P>
<P>
   The Sakhalin consortium so far has spent $1 billion and is
prepared to spend ten times that to fully develop its offshore
fields. But it is stalled by the Russian parliament's refusal to
approve legislation on a production-sharing agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma, the lower house of parliament, is dominated by
Communists and die-hard nationalist parties suspicious of the West
and reluctant to share Russia's resources with big oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the allure of Russia is fading. Countries in Latin America
and Asia, whose economies also need foreign investment, have begun
to woo the oil companies. Even Saudi Arabia, which nationalized its
oil interests in the 1970s, is making overtures to Western
companies to buy a stake there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously Western oil companies take a very long view in
Russia, but they've begun to direct their attentions elsewhere,''
said O'Sullivan. ``They won't leave completely. But they may be
content to allow the oil to stay in the ground another five, 10 or
20 years longer.''

USING FARCE TO BREAK THE DARK SPELL OF FASCISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Oct. 18) 
(JT) 
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fascist humor may be an oxymoron. Fascism, after all, is a
serious matter. It submerges the whims and freedoms of the
individual to the uniform demands of the state. It treats its
authority as natural law and any opposition as mortal sin.
</P>
<P>
   Humor is just the opposite. It thrives on offense, plays on
vulnerabilities and absurdities, inverts authority and mocks
nature; it is surreptitious, sly, iconoclastic. Humor may be, in
its essence, anti-fascistic: It takes what is most self-important,
most unyielding and most unforgiving, and dissolves it into
absurdity. Fascism meets its match in farce.
</P>
<P>
   That is the approach, delicately taken, of the new Italian film
``Life is Beautiful,'' the winner of the grand jury prize at the
1998 Cannes International Film Festival. Its director and
co-writer, Roberto Benigni, also stars in the film as an
irrepressible Jewish bookseller in the 1940s determined to shield
his 5-year-old son Giosue from the horrors of an extermination camp
by pretending that it is all a game being staged for the boy's
amusement.
</P>
<P>
   A bit bizarre, perhaps, not to mention risky _ turning something
so evil into something so trivial. But down to his own jangling
skeleton and rubbery sinews, Benigni's character Guido embodies an
inversion of fascist ideals. He is impossibly voluble, a manic
fantasist, an acrobat, an ironist. When he poses as a fascist
official and has to demonstrate the superiority of the Italian race
to a roomful of children, he strips to his underwear, grandly
praising the nobility and proportions of his scrawny physique.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this comic fable, which opens Friday, he undermines
natural law (the very heart of fascist rhetoric): a key falls from
the sky, a beautiful woman falls into his arms. And, for his son's
benefit, he ``translates'' the threats barked out by a German
prison guard into rules of a childhood game: no one is allowed to
ask for a snack or cry out for mommy.
</P>
<P>
   These are efforts at a kind of enchantment, attempts to
magically undo the fascistic order _ a trademark theme in farce
about fascism. For doesn't fascism itself seem like a form of
hypnotic enchantment, binding a nation to join in its singular
horrors? This dark secret was caught early, in 1929, by Thomas
Mann, in his short story ``Mario and the Magician.'' In an Italian
summer resort, a hunchbacked hypnotist lures a woman to slavishly
follow him, convinces a working-class man to give him an amorous
kiss and demonstrates, in his ominous words, ``that there are
powers stronger than reason or virtue, and not always so
magnanimously ready to relinquish their prey!''
</P>
<P>
   How can such enchantment be undone? Partly with other spells,
some recalling the innocence of childhood. Benigni's character
hypnotically waves his hand and tries to will objects and persons
into place _ a gesture no more absurd than the triumph of the will
being enacted all around him. When the Theatre de Complicite
brought its staged version of Bruno Schulz's ``Street of
Crocodiles'' to the Lincoln Center Festival in the summer, the
image of the character sorting through books banned by the Nazis
gave way to a fantastical universe of childhood memories, a world
in which men walked on walls, turned into birds and became infants
seeking comfort from impending doom.
</P>
<P>
   Enchantment in a rawer form occurs in the Italian director Lina
Wertmuller's ``Seven Beauties'' (1976). The vain, bumbling hatchet
murderer (played by Giancarlo Giannini), who has been imprisoned in
a concentration camp, is brought to the private den of the grossly
corpulent concentration camp commandant (Shirley Stoler). He sings
her praises, declaring his love, hoping it will win him freedom:
``Who are you?'' he asks, ``An enchantress? A magician? Because you
have put a spell on me.'' Sex with her, he secretly hopes, might
set him free, but as he stares at her tree-trunk thighs he can
barely work the necessary magic.
</P>
<P>
   But humor may be the most powerful of counter-spells. The risk,
though, is that in the midst of dissolving fascism in farce, it
also dissolves the suffering of its victims. Benigni, in a recent
telephone interview from Italy, named Charlie Chaplin's ``Great
Dictator'' as an important influence. In that 1940 film, characters
resembling Mussolini and Hitler get into a petulant food fight;
Hynkel (Hitler) has two sidekicks named Garbitsch and Herring, and
Hitler's plans for world domination are lampooned in the
now-classic ballet with an inflated globe, set to Wagnerian musical
strains. Meanwhile the Jews in a ghetto become aware of at least
part of Hynkel's great plan: ``Get rid of the Jews first, then the
brunettes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chaplin also said that if he had known the extent of the
German horrors, he would never have made the film. In his heavily
accented English, Benigni acknowledged a similar concern. ``I quote
this a lot of times,'' he said. ``I worried about this a lot. Yes,
of course. This is my first thought. Nobody can make a gag about
Nazis; because humor must be detached, and here it can't be.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, one radical approach, taken by Mel Brooks in ``The
Producers,'' is to charge ahead, treating even the anticipated
offense as an object of humor. His Broadway impresario (Zero
Mostel)  &UR; yearns &LR;  to offend his opening night audience, hoping for a
theatrical flop. He courts tastelessness: he will turn Nazism into
campy farce. But when the musical becomes a comic hit, crowned by
the big production number, ``Springtime for Hitler,'' it is not
just fascism that is dissolved into farce but solemn pieties about
fascism.
</P>
<P>
   Benigni obviously did not want to go so far. But his character
is also detached from both his surroundings and the intimations of
fascist dominance in his town of Arezzo. At first he is unaffected
by the disturbing signs, and later he is intent on  &UR; seeming &LR;  to be
in order to protect his son. He is almost nonchalant about a sign
in a store window, ``No Jews or dogs.'' He tries to turn it into a
jest for his son, shielding him from its cruelty; he mentions a
hardware store he once saw with a sign reading, ``No kangaroos or
Chinese,'' and proposes a sign on his own bookshop, ``No spiders or
Visigoths.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This is how the movie works its double-edged spell: in trying to
treat fascism itself as a game for a child, Benigni's character
ends up revealing both its nightmarishness and its grotesque
absurdity. The magic doesn't always work: there are times when
Benigni's fable makes the camps so much less horrific than they
really were that one begins to question the fable's premise. But
the character's efforts to preserve his son's innocence, down to
his final mocking goose-step, are heart-rending. Benigni said he
had in mind the classic clown's ability to illuminate tragedy by
touching the ``majesty of truth.''
</P>
<P>
   This style of death-haunted clowning may even be part of the
Italian theatrical tradition (something that Mann seemed to know in
his tale as well). It is there in Fellini's 1974 ``Amarcord'' _ a
film Benigni mentioned _ in which fascism has the aura of a circus,
dominated by ``the big, big face of Mussolini.'' It is also there
in the Italian commedia dell' arte, in which the buffoon often
faces death. The Italian clown Toto was immensely popular during
the fascist period, Benigni pointed out. ``Physically, he was like
a skeleton,'' he said. In the midst of his clowning ``everything
was full of death; behind the laugh there was death.''
</P>
<P>
   And behind fascism there might be a laugh. ``My pop planned
something like this for me, too, when I was little,'' Benigni's
character tells his son as they are being transported to the camps
on their surprise outing. Ha.

AND NOW TO THE HARDWARE: A RICER, OF COURSE, BUT WHICH? 
</HEADLINE>
   (With MASHED-POTATOES)  
 (bl)  
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 C.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The potato ricer has survived into the age of the
food processor. And it has the starch content of the potato to
thank. The food processor's blade slices open too many of its
starchy cells, and what you end up with is not a silky potato
puree, but a sticky, gluey, unpleasant mess.
</P>
<P>
   So the potato ricer remains the only way to get a perfectly
smooth potato puree.
</P>
<P>
   Most potato ricers look like large garlic presses. The boiled
potato sits in a cylinder or V-shaped receptacle, and the handles
are squeezed together to push the potato through a plate punched
with small round holes. This crushes the potato into shapes varying
from small grains of rice to strands the thickness of yarn,
depending on the ricer.
</P>
<P>
   Some starch is released when this is done, but not enough to
make the resulting puree tight and gluey. Once riced, the potatoes
can be placed back into a pan and heated gently while you stir in
cream, butter, olive oil, herbs, or whatever you like.
</P>
<P>
   All five potato ricers I tested produced fine pureed potato, but
some did it with more ease than others.
</P>
<P>
   I began with the monster: the Admiral Craft V ricer. Large and
industrial, it looks more suitable for a cafeteria kitchen than a
home. I thought it might have some advantages for Thanksgiving. I
was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   There is a hook on the ricer end so you can position it on the
edge of a bowl. The idea is good. But this thing is so heavy and
you have to press so hard that it slips all over the place, bowl
and all.
</P>
<P>
   The other frustration is that, despite its size and solidity, I
could rice only one potato at a time. You would need to have
Schwarzenegger forearms to handle two or more potatoes. If that's
your build and you eat A LOT of mashed potatoes, this ricer is sold
at Broadway Panhandler, 477 Broome St., (Wooster Street), (212)
966-3434, for $47.95.
</P>
<P>
   SCI Cuisine International makes a ricer almost identical to the
Admiral Craft, but smaller and without the bowl hook.
</P>
<P>
   It rices potatoes into tiny little shreds, but the handle has
such hard edges that your hand suffers through the entire process.
And the flat part that presses the potato against the holes does
not press it far enough, so you are left with a layer of flattened
potato in the ricer after each potato.
</P>
<P>
   Its best attribute is that it's a bargain, just $9.95 at
Broadway Panhandler. Personally, I'd rather pay for comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why I was interested in Williams-Sonoma's Metaltex
potato ricer. It is made of plastic, which makes it comfortable in
the hand, and it has three ricer plates, each with different-size
holes. The plates are held in place by a plastic cylinder that fits
snugly inside the main cylinder; I would have preferred it without
this extra part to wash.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, most potatoes require a lot of force to rice, and
when using this plastic ricer, I could feel its potential to crack.
Which is not what I want to feel when I am paying $12 for it. It is
available by mail-order at (800) 541-2233.
</P>
<P>
   Far superior to the first three was the aluminum Simplex 2
Dischi potato ricer. Though there is no bowl hook or support, the
handles are rounded so that even when you press hard, it is easy to
hold.
</P>
<P>
   This ricer comes with two plates, one with small holes the size
of sesame seeds and one with larger ones the size of peppercorns.
It costs $11.98 at Zabar's, 2245 Broadway (80th Street), (212)
787-2000. It was a pleasure to use, rather than an ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Comfort, ease of use and quality all came together in the Oxo
potato ricer. The handles, padded with black rubber, were gentle on
the hands. There are no interchangeable plates, so the cylinder
holding the potato is one solid piece and is easy to clean.
</P>
<P>
   Potatoes riced through the tiny holes came out like spaghetti,
and because it is so solid, keeping control of it was effortless.
It is sold for $19.95 at Broadway Panhandler and at a Cook's
Companion, 152 Atlantic Ave., Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, (718)
852-6641.

   THEN AND NOW: CHANGES SINCE THE 1973 ARAB OIL EMBARGO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Imports, 28 percent of total U.S. oil consumption in 1973,
have risen to 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC), which supplied 54 percent of the world's crude oil, now
provide 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Inflation-adjusted retail prices have risen 6.5 percent for
gasoline and 7 percent for electricity in those 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The inflation-adjusted price paid by refiners for crude oil
has risen by 58 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The inflation-adjusted price of natural gas as it comes out of
the ground has increased by 187 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  U.S. consumption of petroleum is up by 13 percent, though the
nation's growing population means that on a per-person basis, it is
down by 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Improved exploration and development technology has cut the
cost of finding new oil and gas wells by 68 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The average car then got 14 miles per gallon, compared to
today's 28.5 miles per gallon for a car and 20.4 miles per gallon
for light trucks -- including minivans, sport utility vehicles and
small pickups.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Today's average car or light truck has 25 percent more
horsepower than its equivalent in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The 31 percent share of homes heated by oil has dropped to 17
percent. The main reason: The 54 percent share of new homes heated
by natural gas has risen to 69 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Electric utilities, which got 17 percent of their power from
oil before the embargo, get only 2.5 percent from oil today.
Natural gas, then 18 percent of fuel for utilities, fell to 9.5
percent. To make up the difference, coal rose from 46 percent to
nearly 57 percent of utility fuel, and nuclear rose from 4.5
percent to about about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  While U.S. energy consumption has increased by 27 percent
since the embargo, energy use has grown so much faster in other
countries that the U.S. share of the world's energy consumption has
dropped from 31 percent in 1973 to 25 percent today.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Twenty-five years ago, Arab countries around the
Persian Gulf started an oil embargo that shattered Americans'
complacency over the security of their energy supply.
</P>
<P>
   The artificial oil shortage that began on Oct. 18, 1973, led to
six months of agonizing and improvising by government officials and
drivers desperate to find a service station that still had gas.
</P>
<P>
   In the next quarter-century, the federal government spent more
than $90 billion looking for ways to reduce our reliance on foreign
oil.
</P>
<P>
   Today, over-production and faltering demand from developing
countries has created a worldwide glut of oil. Half the oil
consumed in the United States -- or roughly one-fifth of the
nation's total energy supply -- is imported from Mexico, Canada and
other foreign lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Americans have apparently forgotten about that crisis of
25 years ago,'' said Cecile Warner, who has not. An engineer who
directs the federal Center for Renewable Energy Resources in
Golden, Colo., she designed, built and lives in ``a passive solar
home that uses less than one-third of the energy of a home built to
today's standards.''
</P>
<P>
   New energy efficiencies have cut petroleum use per person. But
expensive efforts to develop clean, non-nuclear alternatives to
fossil fuels have failed to come up with a product cheap enough to
compete with deregulated oil and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than half our oil now is imported, compared to only a
little more than one-third before the embargo, and that figure is
expected to rise to about two-thirds by 2020,'' Warner cautioned.
``Average vehicle miles per gallon are decreasing because of the
popularity of sport -utility vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, today's SUVs and other light trucks average more than 20
miles per gallon -- while the average car or pick-up of 1973 burned
up a gallon every 14 miles.
</P>
<P>
   That may be one reason why few Americans even noticed the three
price-propping production cutbacks announced in the last 10 months
by the the Arab and non-Arab countries in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   OPEC's first two cutbacks flopped. The third, announced in June,
might be taking hold. After sliding from $25 a barrel in October
1996 to under $14 in August, the world price for crude oil has
bobbed up to around $16 in the last two months. The two-dollar jump
translates to about a nickel a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Sales from new suppliers dilute any cutback's effects. ``Russia,
the Caspian Sea region, Asia, West Africa and Latin America'' are
the industry's new frontiers, said Michael Cates, chief economist
of the American Petroleum Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond this, our vulnerability to such disruptions has been
significantly reduced by the development of the (federal) Strategic
Petroleum Reserve,'' Cates said. The reserve's storage pits hold
enough crude oil to make up for the loss of all U.S. imports for
about 60 days -- longer in the more likely event that only part of
the imports are blocked. The reserve system worked well in 1990
during and after the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   But the 1973 embargo was another story. The Saudis announced
that if the United States continued supporting Israel militarily,
it wouldn't be allowed to buy Arab oil.
</P>
<P>
   That threat was issued just one day after 11 Arab nations agreed
in Kuwait City to raise the charge for their oil by 17 percent and
prop up the new price by cutting their production by five percent
each month.
</P>
<P>
   Defying the economic and political threat, the United States
continued to re-supply the Israelis as they drove back the
Soviet-supplied armies of Syria and Egypt, which had invaded Israel
earlier in the month on the solemn Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur.
</P>
<P>
   Public confidence in American leaders was sinking that month, as
Vice President Spiro Agnew was forced to resign and President
Richard Nixon ordered the firing of the Watergate special
prosecutor. In addition, an elaborate system of price and wage
controls had failed to prevent heating-oil shortages the previous
winter and disruptions of the gasoline supply that summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recall consumers following our delivery trucks and when the
truck arrived at the station, it would be trailing a ready-made
line of cars waiting for gas,'' said Leo Liebowitz, president and
CEO of Getty Oil, an independent oil marketer on Long Island, N.Y.

   ``We were pumping about 52,000 gallons a month, but as soon as
the embargo hit, I was cut back to 26,000,'' remembered station
owner Larry Beattie of Augusta, Ga. ``I think the oil companies and
the government, both of them, overdid it, and, of course, there was
a little abuse of the situation by some people on the side.''

   Station closings were most common in Florida, Georgia, the
Carolinas and Tennessee. ``We'd have 70 to 100 dealers who'd spend
their own money to go up to Washington and lobby for relief,'' said
Jack Houston, retired executive director of the Georgia Association
of Petroleum Retailers.

   Drivers who used to wait until their gas tank was three-quarters
empty began refilling when their tank was three-quarters full.
``Better safe than sorry,'' said Lois Epstein's grandfather, when
she asked why they were lined up to buy gasoline for the second day
in a row. Multiplied by millions of motorists, that precaution
drained oil terminals, tank farms and refineries of surpluses that
could have eased the pain.
</P>
<P>
   Epstein, now a senior engineer with the Environmental Defense
Fund, said she worries that oil today is so cheap and plentiful
that careless companies lack economic incentives to fix leaky
equipment that could contaminate water or soil.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   At the embargo's peak, crude oil imports dropped by 17 percent.
The 38-cent average price for gasoline jumped to 54 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter, a governor who three years later would be elected
president, asked Georgia's state employes to save electricity by
using the stairs instead of the elevators at work.

<P>
   Millions of Americans heeded Nixon's pleas to turn down their
home and office thermostats to 68 degrees.

<P>
   Airlines conserved jet fuel by packing more passengers onto
fewer flights. They overbooked so heavily that when consumer
advocate Ralph Nader was bumped, a federal district judge ordered
the airline to pay him $25,100.
</P>
<P>
   The big neon signs in front of motels blinked off. Nixon parked
Air Force One and caught a commercial flight to his home in
California. That year, the lights on the national Christmas tree
erected outside the White House each December were kept turned off.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices stayed up, and Israel reached a truce with Syria and
Egypt. Missions accomplished, the Arabs halted their embargo in
March 1974.
</P>
<P>
   But many older Americans still suspect it was all a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knew what was going on,'' recalled Lee Ramsnyder, who
operated the Lan-Mar Marina on Georgia's Lake Lanier. ``I remember
hearing there was a secret supply in Louisiana or someplace like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We pumped most of our gas to boaters on weekends, and we kept
running out by Sunday afternoon,'' he said. ``I think maybe a lot
of it was done by the government to pull us out of a little
recession by making people back up a bit on fuel use and dig in.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ramsnyder rebuilds used tour buses, installs luxuries
ranging from stoves and showers to trash compactors, and then sells
the vehicles to entertainers and other travelers who don't care
that they only get about eight miles to the gallon.

NEW YORK SENATE LEADER OPPOSES LAW ON HATE CRIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CAHER  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Despite the brutal murder of a gay man in Wyoming
and increasing pressure to enact bias-crime legislation, the leader
of New York's Senate has grave reservations about joining the 41
states that impose tougher penalties on perpetrators of so-called
hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, who has blocked legislation
in the past that would increase penalties for attacks stemming from
prejudice based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation,
ethnicity or disability, said he favors tough sentences for any
violent criminal, regardless of the motivation, and is leery of
creating a special class of victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone deserves an extra five years for a crime, they
ought to get an extra five years whether they committed it against
you, me, a straight person, or anybody, not just for somebody who
is considered gay or senior or Jewish,'' Bruno, a Republican, said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno has for several years shut the door on hate-crime
legislation, despite bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Gov. George Pataki has twice proposed bias-crime
legislation and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat from
Manhattan, has repeatedly passed his own version in the lower
house. Attorney General Dennis Vacco is a strong proponent of a
hate-crime bill. But without Bruno's say-so, the measure is
probably doomed in New York, and Bruno remains cool to the concept.
</P>
<P>
   The issue, which emerges annually and relatively quietly, takes
on heightened visibility in the wake of the death Monday of Matthew
Shepard. Shepard, 21, a University of Wyoming student, was savagely
beaten, pistol-whipped and lashed to a fence post. The Police said
that robbery was the main motive but that Shepard apparently was
chosen in part because he was gay.
</P>
<P>
   New York state Sen. Neil Breslin, a Democrat from Delmar and
proponent of bias-crime legislation, has never had an opportunity
to vote on such a law because the Republican majority led by Bruno
will not let the bill out of committee.
</P>
<P>
   Breslin on Monday expressed hope that Shepard's death would
provide the impetus to bring a hate-crime bill to the floor of the
Senate in the next session. Bruno said he is open to discussions on
any initiative that might deter crime, but said the Shepard
incident alone did not affect his views on hate crime, although it
did reinforce his belief that violent criminals should be subjected
to the severest penalties allowed by law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that crime that was committed (in Wyoming) was about
as hateful and disturbing as anything could be,'' Bruno said. ``My
feeling is, and has always been, you have to punish people who
commit crimes like that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bruno suggested hate-crime legislation is unnecessary, and
possibly unwise. The majority leader said the state already has a
statute that allows judges to increase sentences when there are
aggravating circumstances, and questions whether it is appropriate
for the state to declare crimes against members of certain groups
as more serious than offenses against other individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco argues that an assault on an individual motivated by
hatred toward a particular group _ minorities, gays, Catholics and
others _ is essentially an attack designed to intimidate and
instill fear in an entire class of citizenry and should be punished
accordingly, said spokesman Mike Zabel. The attorney general has
supported Pataki's bias crime initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Silver, however, claims that Pataki has shown no leadership on
the issue and made no effort to nudge his allies in the Senate,
such as Bruno, to consider the bill, according to spokeswoman
Patricia Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McKeon, spokesman for the governor, noted that Pataki
proposed bias crime legislation in 1997 and 1998 and remains
committed to the concept. He said Silver, who has refused to
consider many of the governor's criminal justice initiatives, has
``no credibility'' on issues of crime and punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Federal statistics indicate that hate crimes in New York jumped
7.4 percent from 1995 to 1996 _ and in 1995, New York law
enforcement agencies reported the second highest number of
hate-crime incidents in the nation, 845. California led with 1,751.

   KUWAIT CITY, Kuwait _ There has never been so much available
oil, which is good news for motorists at gas pumps just about
everywhere -- but here.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices are dropping. So, nervous officials in this oil-rich
sheikhdom might raise the price of gasoline in their own land to
raise money for the government-sponsored lifestyle of free
health-care, full employment and air-conditioned comfort.
</P>
<P>
   High-priced gasoline would be a reversal of fortune for Kuwait.
It's oil reserves make up nearly one-tenth of the world's supply
and gushes up through drill holes to the desert surface without the
pumps needed elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks odd and peculiar that, at a time when many countries
are cutting the prices at the gas stations, you're increasing it in
Kuwait,'' said Kuwaiti Oil Minister Saud Nasir Al-Sabah in a recent
interview with Cox News Service. ``That's absurd . . . I don't
think this is something that's acceptable to us now.''
</P>
<P>
   Life is still good here. Car dealerships are busy every night
and young Kuwaitis can still count on a job in the bloated
government bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   But Kuwait and its oil-producing neighbors, from wealthy Saudi
Arabia to giant and volatile Iran, are struggling with the
ramifications of low oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, the so-called Arab oil embargo shocked
the West. Attempting to keep the U.S. from backing Israel, these
countries threatened to cut oil supplies -- particularly to the
U.S., where frightened Americans rushed to line up their
gas-guzzling automobiles at pumps despite rising prices.
</P>
<P>
   The panic in the West brought a windfall in the Gulf, which
became awash in cash as well as oil. Big countries like Iran and
Iraq could bring their people modern social services, roads and
education. Small countries, like Kuwait, could luxuriate.
</P>
<P>
   It raised the gulf countries' world clout. Arabic became an
official language at the United Nations. The United States started
selling sophisticated military airplanes to the Saudis.
</P>
<P>
   But, prompted by the higher prices, new competition in oil
production took off from Mexico to Russia. And, oil importers --
especially the United States -- found ways to conserve.
</P>
<P>
   Today, oil prices are about as low, adjusted for inflation, as
they were before the embargo in 1973. More oil is produced than
ever -- 73 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   So, while Persian Gulf oil exporters still sit on 65 percent of
the world's supply, it is losing value. The 11-member OPEC cartel
(including three nations outside the Mideast) will see revenues
drop by a third this year -- down about $40 billion. Since 1980,
the per capita income in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and three other
oil-producing monarchies has dropped by more than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A continued decline in oil prices could cause hard times here,
leading to radicalism -- or worse, instability -- even among
stalwart American allies like Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Kuwait has just 1.8 million inhabitants and nearly 10 percent
of the world's oil. But, Kuwaitis are edgy about the soundness of a
system that provides free health-care, subsidized utilities and
charges no income or sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More vulnerable is Saudi Arabia, with about 18 million people.
It is also cutting back benefits -- like the low-income housing
loans for newlyweds -- while trying to calm a restless minority of
have-nots and religious fundamentalists. Unemployment is rising.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More volatile still is Iran. A regional giant with 68 million
people, Iran's government deficit and economic recession could
undercut nascent steps toward detente with the West.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Iraq is another story. Its oil production has been limited by
economic sanctions and industrial disrepair following the Persian
Gulf War. But, should things improve -- and Russia and China have
their way -- its production will kick into gear and add to the oil
glut.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Zalmay Khalilzad, director for Strategic Studies at the Rand
Corp., warns that the United States is still dependent on Persian
Gulf oil supplies. If Americans want low prices, he said, they may
have to be ready to help quell the resulting unrest in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The oil producers tend to make the problem worse. Most have
refused to make tough cuts in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gulf countries, unfortunately, are still dreaming that the
welfare state will last forever,'' said Kuwaiti political scientist
Shamlan al-Essa(CQ).
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they just try to raise money by pumping and selling
more oil. That lowers the price even more.
</P>
<P>
   Far from controlling the market, OPEC members now are struggling
just to keep their organization together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole situation is very different than it was in the
past,'' Al Sabah said. ``We have to be extremely careful about
mixing oil and politics.''

   BEIJING _ Oil barons around the world, take heart: China's leap
toward prosperity has caused nearly 1 million families to switch
from bicycles to cars.
</P>
<P>
   By itself, the coming of the car culture to China isn't going to
shock the world's oil markets, as did the Arab oil embargo of
1973-74.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Chinese private car phenomenon should gain momentum
in the next few years just when the rest of Asia is soaring back
from its current economic crisis, the combined impact on world oil
prices could be dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   The simple mechanism of supply-and-demand could slowly crimp the
world oil market in much the same way as members of OPEC did in the
oil cartel's heyday, when they agreed to cut production quotas --
and then stuck to the rules. Gradually, oil would become less
available and the price would go up.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the number of private cars in China has jumped from
virtually zero five years ago to at least 699,000, according to a
report by the China Automobile Market Survey and Research Society.
China's auto makers are now increasing the production of passenger
sedans by 15 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the year 2000, there will be at least 1 million privately
owned vehicles in China's cities,'' the research society declared.
``In major municipalities and provincial capitals, the ownership
rate among families will reach five(CQ) percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, since 1996 China has ``trimmed'' the production of
bicycles, the China Light Industry News reported last month. It
attributed the fall-off to ``shrinking market demand'' and
``accelerated development of the automobile industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Though affluence is on the rise in China, the rest of Asia is in
a deep recession. This has flattened Asia's spectacular 5
percent-a-year growth in oil consumption that generally kept world
prices above $24 a barrel throughout the 1980s. When Asia's energy
demand sagged last year, world oil prices slid by this summer to
below $11 a barrel, their lowest level (on an inflation-adjusted
basis) since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, almost every expert believes that Asian oil demand will
start to rebound fairly soon. When that happens, it will probably
spell the end of cheap gasoline around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Writing this March in the American journal ``Foreign Affairs,''
world oil experts Daniel Yergin, Dennis Eklof and Jefferson Edwards
predicted that overall Asian energy consumption ``will again rise
sharply in two or three years'' -- once Japan and its neighbors
solve their internal economic woes.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in the lowest trough of the Asian economic doldrums,
Asian countries consume about 19 million barrels of oil a day.
That's just over one-fourth of the oil that is used worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Oil fields in Asia produce just 8 million barrels for Asia's
daily needs; the remaining 11 million barrels a day must be
imported. Three-fourths of Asia's imported petroleum comes from the
Persian Gulf, with Saudi Arabia by far the largest supplier.
</P>
<P>
   ``In sum, the prospects for Asia's oil supply look decidedly
grim,'' wrote Yergin, Eklof and Edwards. ``By 2010, (Asian)
productive capacity will have declined 6 percent from its 2005
peak, with new oil field developments unable to compensate for
maturing Indonesian, Malaysian and Australian fields. So regardless
of exploration, Asia is destined to import more than 20 million
barrels of oil per day by 2010, compared with approximately 11
million today.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   China is the newest and fastest-growing customer for Middle East
oil. Until five years ago, China was proud of its status as an
``energy-independent'' oil exporter. But thanks to its own meteoric
economic growth, China now imports 25 percent of its oil, amounting
to 1 million barrels a day. So far, most is for industrial uses and
only a small fraction for private cars.
</P>
<P>
   China derives another 3 million barrels a day of oil from
domestic oil wells while obtaining the balance of its energy from
massive reliance on coal, and hydro-electric and a few nuclear
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Most of China's imported oil now comes from Saudi Arabia, Iran
and the United Arab Emirates. Determined to diversify its oil
sources beyond the Persian Gulf, China's national petroleum
corporation last year outbid some of the biggest Western oil
companies for the right to help develop some of the choicest
Caspian Sea Basin oil properties in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   Still, China's steep increases in oil imports worries some
Chinese energy experts. Early last year retired scientists Yang
Jike, the former vice president of China's national environmental
protection committee, published a warning that it was better to
rely
</P>
<P>
   on coal than imported oil.
</P>
<P>
   If China allowed its oil imports to increase, ``China will get
entangled in Middle East politics, like the United States,'' Yang
wrote.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ When the price of crude oil falls, it's happy days
for American consumers and the U.S. economy. But those same price
cuts strike fear in the hearts of Mexicans and Venezuelans, now
critical exporters of oil to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil dominates the economies of Latin America's biggest
producers. And every time prices fall, big cuts in federal spending
and economic crisis are sure to follow.
</P>
<P>
   The ties that bind the U.S. and its Latin American suppliers
have grown strong since the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s, part of
a promise by the U.S. to diversify and avoid oil dependence on one
region.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, for example, is expected to supply the U.S. with 13.4
percent of its imported oil in 1998. That's up from 1.2 percent in
1975. In 1985 Mexico's share of U.S. oil imports hit a high of more
than 16 percent, then dropped a bit before rising again this year.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   The growth of mutual dependency between the United States and
Mexico is ironic, given how jealously Mexico guards its national
resources. In Mexico, the day that oil was nationalized in 1938 is
still celebrated as a moment of civic pride, and suggestions that
privatizing the nation's oil industry to make it more efficient
always prompts a flurry of angry denunciations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, not all of Mexico's oil was sold to the United
States,'' said John Lichtbleu, an analyst with Pira Energy Group in
New York. ``There was a time when they didn't want to sell more
than 50 percent of exports to the U.S. because of a fear of
domination. Now 85 to 90 percent of Mexican exported oil goes to
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   While the northward flow helps stabilize the Mexican economy, it
also means demand and price fluctuations have a greater impact on
average Mexicans. About 33 percent of the country's federal revenue
comes from Petroleos de Mexico -- Pemex -- the government's oil
company.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   That's a dependency Mexico has tried hard to shake. A decade
ago, oil money made up 45 percent of the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   And oil used to be Mexico's number one export, drawing three out
of every four dollars worth of foreign capital flowing into the
country. Today, as Mexico has built up its manufacturing base, oil
accounts for only 5.4 percent of the foreign revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the economy and the national budget are highly vulnerable
to the ups and downs of international oil prices. Three times this
year Mexican government officials made emergency budget spending
cuts to make up for oil revenue shortfalls. More cuts are expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico will have to operate next year with an austere budget
and somehow depend less on oil revenues,'' said Jonathan Heath, a
Mexico City-based economist. ``That will be tough for a country
like Mexico, where public needs are so great today.''
</P>
<P>
   The bust-and-boom oil price cycles have been even rougher on
Venezuela, who's main crude producer, Petroleos de Venezuela, is
the world's second largest.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela puts out 3 million barrels of crude each day, and
relies on oil to generate 60 percent of its government budget
revenue and 80 percent of its foreign income.
</P>
<P>
   The result: recession and political instability this year as the
price for Venezuelan crude hit a 12-year low; oil revenue is off by
a third; the government has slashed spending by $4 billion; and
bank-loan interest rates have soared to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The chaos has opened the door for protectionist politicians like
Hugo Chavez, a former military leader who headed a failed coup in
1992 against then-president Carlos Andres Perez. Chavez is the
front-runner in the race for presidency, which culminates in a
December vote.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has promised to revisit Venezuela's open-door policy on
outside investments in the nation's oil business -- a move that
could crimp the revenues of dozens of foreign companies that
operate in Venezuela. He's even hinted at cutting back on exports
to rich nations, like the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chavez is really the big unknown and he's got investors
scared,'' said Don Bowles, Latin America director for the Economist
Intelligence Unit, a research firm in London. ``Whether he wins,
and what he decides to do if he does, will shape the country's
economic future and could affect the oil industry.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Think of the world's major oil powers and the first
images likely to come to mind are of Persian Gulf sheikdoms or the
sun-baked Texas plains.
</P>
<P>
   Think vodka and snow, too.
</P>
<P>
   A sizable portion of the world's future oil and natural gas
supplies will come from Russia and other former Soviet republics,
if Western oil companies can get to it.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the Soviet Union seven years ago sparked the
last great oil boom of this century.
</P>
<P>
   Oil giants like Exxon, Amoco, Mobil, Shell, Texaco and British
Petroleum are investing billions of dollars across the continent to
tap oil and gas fields from the Siberian tundra of Russia to the
arid Central Asian plains of Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't be here and ready with this kind money if it
wasn't worth it,'' said Alexander Ordjonikidze of the Sakhalin
Energy Investment Company, a consortium of Shell, Marathon and
several Japanese partners that is set to begin offshore production
next year off Russia's far east coast.
</P>
<P>
   Worthwhile maybe, but it is far from easy.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is the world's second largest energy supplier; it
produces more natural gas than any country in the world and is
third behind Saudi Arabia and the United States in quantities of
oil.
</P>
<P>
   But its teetering economy and aging production facilities have
left its status as an oil and gas giant in a sorry state, pumping
about half the levels it did a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Western oil companies have touted themselves as the solution to
Russia's problem -- with partnerships to help Russia extract its
oil and get it to market.
</P>
<P>
   Yet frustrated oil companies have run up against a snarl of
bureaucracy, unfavorable tax conditions and changing terms of the
production deals by Russian partners who want a bigger stake. With
Russia's economy now in crisis and its market reformers on the
political outs, conditions are not expected to improve soon.
</P>
<P>
   Flat world oil prices and a threat of global recession have
further eliminated the urgency and eagerness to push ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Along the Caspian Sea on Russia's southern fringe, billions of
dollars in deals are going forward in a region with the largest new
oil finds in three decades.
</P>
<P>
   It is hailed as the next great Middle East, and the Caspian Sea
basin -- including the former Soviet republics of Kazakhstan,
Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and the breakaway Russian republic
Chechnya -- could be just that.
</P>
<P>
   The region combines the lucrative and dangerous elements of oil,
political unrest and geopolitical implications as the United
States, Russia and Iran vie for influence there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cliche about the former Soviet Union is it is a place with
lots of problems and lots of opportunities. The problems may now
look bigger than they did two or three years ago, but the oil is
still here,'' said Stephen O'Sullivan, an oil and gas industry
analyst in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the Caspian prizes is the Tengiz oil field in
Kazakhstan. Tengiz potentially could produce more than 1 million
barrels a day -- more than the current yield of Alaska's Prudhoe
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   But how to get the oil from the Caspian basin to market has been
a source of diplomatic frustration and intrigue. Russia, Iran and
the United States have differing alternatives for pipelines to the
West.
</P>
<P>
   In the far east, an estimated 2.5 billion barrels of oil and 400
billion cubic meters of natural gas lie under the waters around
Sakhalin Island.
</P>
<P>
   The Sakhalin consortium so far has spent $1 billion and is
prepared to spend ten times that to fully develop its offshore
fields. But it is stalled by the Russian parliament's refusal to
approve legislation on a production-sharing agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma, the lower house of parliament, is dominated by
Communists and die-hard nationalist parties suspicious of the West
and reluctant to share Russia's resources with big oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the allure of Russia is fading. Countries in Latin America
and Asia, whose economies also need foreign investment, have begun
to woo the oil companies. Even Saudi Arabia, which nationalized its
oil interests in the 1970s, is making overtures to Western
companies to buy a stake there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously Western oil companies take a very long view in
Russia, but they've begun to direct their attentions elsewhere,''
said O'Sullivan. ``They won't leave completely. But they may be
content to allow the oil to stay in the ground another five, 10 or
20 years longer.''

 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are those who love their mashed potatoes lumpy, and those
who prefer them ultra silky. I'm a classicist: to me, the perfect
mashed potatoes are smooth and thickly creamy, but not overly
buttered, with a definite potato flavor.
</P>
<P>
   I always follow certain rules: boil whole potatoes in their
skins (so they absorb less water and have better flavor and
texture). Use salted water (to reduce the amount of salt needed at
the end). Avoid new potatoes (too moist and waxy, they make a gummy
mash). Mash the potatoes with an old-fashioned ricer, food mill,
fork or wire masher, never a machine (which also turns them to
glue). Finally, heat any liquid added to the potatoes, like milk or
cream.
</P>
<P>
   When I'm in the mood for something indulgent, I like mashed
potatoes a la Joel Robuchon, the French chef. These mashed
potatoes, widely considered the ultimate, have been copied all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
   To make them, start with fingerling or Yukon Gold potatoes
(Robuchon uses a variety called the ratte or the princesse). Scrub
the potatoes, and place them in a pot of cold, well-salted water.
Bring to a boil, and cook covered, at a simmer, for 20 to 30
minutes. Drain, then peel the potatoes as soon as possible (hold
them with mitts or a clean towel) and pass them through a ricer
into a heavy saucepan.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, for a few minutes to dry the
potatoes, then add, for each pound of potatoes, six to eight
tablespoons of cold butter in bits, beating the potatoes constantly
with a big wooden spoon or paddle. Add about a half cup of scalded
whole milk in a thin stream, then season the puree with sea salt.
They have to be eaten to be believed.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs insist that the drying step is necessary for a perfect
puree, one that home cooks usually omit. ``The more steam you take
out of the cooked potatoes, the nuttier and creamier the puree will
be,'' David Bouley said. He often substitutes olive oil or a puree
of roasted onions for some of the butter.
</P>
<P>
   Robuchon makes only a few variations: olive oil or goose fat for
the butter, and nutmeg or saffron as seasonings. That's about it.
American chefs have gone farther afield:
</P>
<P>
   _ A few tablespoons of fresh, tender herbs, especially basil
pureed with olive oil or snipped chives, add color and flavor.
</P>
<P>
   _ Root vegetables like turnips, parsnips or celery root can be
boiled, mashed and added to the potato puree for flavor; carrots,
sweet potatoes, beets, pumpkin or butternut squash contribute color
as well. You can make up to half the mash with other vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   _ Peeled garlic cloves can be boiled with the potatoes and
mashed at the same time. Pureed roasted garlic is another good
addition. Raw garlic is too harsh.
</P>
<P>
   _ Onions, shallots or leeks _ chopped and sauteed until they are
soft and golden _ are good to fold in at the end. Crisp sauteed
onions, perhaps with chicken cracklings, are better as a topping.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mincings of black truffle with some truffle juice or truffle
oil ennoble a puree, but white truffles should be shaved on top,
otherwise they get lost.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mushrooms, finely diced and sauteed until tender but not
crisp, can be folded into the puree. One recipe uses the black corn
fungus, huitlacoche, making the potatoes nearly black.
</P>
<P>
   _ Grated fresh horseradish and sour cream, folded in at the end,
are popular, especially with hearty beef dishes like short ribs.
Prepared horseradish is not as good because it is made with
vinegar. Using wasabi paste, sold in tubes in many food shops,
instead of white horseradish, adds a different sharpness and a hint
of green.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sweet red pepper puree blended with the potatoes makes a
pretty side dish, served with red snapper.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cheese, especially grated parmesan or soft goat cheese, can be
folded in.
</P>
<P>
   _ Add steamed diced cabbage or kale, and you're on your way to
Irish colcannon, also made with chopped onion. Steamed spinach, of
course, may evoke those less-than-felicitous childhood memories.

WINE TALK: BOTTLES BY MAIL FROM BROOKS BROTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brooks Brothers is getting into the wine business. But please,
hold the jokes about buttoned-down merlot and pinstriped
chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   As many charge customers of the venerable haberdasher already
know (a brochure went out recently with the monthly bills), the new
venture is called Brooks Brothers Cellar, and it is strictly a
mail-order business. So no, you won't be able to drop into your
nearest Brooks Brothers store for a pair of socks and an '82
Latour.
</P>
<P>
   It works like this: Send Brooks Brothers Cellar $30 a month,
plus shipping, and it will send you two bottles of wine.
Subscriptions, if that's the appropriate word, are for three, six
or 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   The 180-year-old company is moving into wine cautiously. The
program is available in only three states, New York, New Jersey and
Massachusetts, but there are plans to expand it to about 20 other
states that permit selling wine by mail.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks Brothers Cellar is the latest in a series of moves by the
clothier to attract a newer, younger clientele and update its image
while taking advantage of its famous name. The company recently
licensed its name to a line of eyewear. ``Brooks Brothers is a
slumbering giant,'' said Barbara Barry, a Los Angeles designer
hired to polish the company image.
</P>
<P>
   As Paul Gitter, the Brooks Brothers executive overseeing the
wine program, put it: ``This is a life-style brand. It has immense
possibilities, and we plan to exploit them all.''
</P>
<P>
   Wine clubs like this one are not new. Windsor Vineyards, a
subsidiary of Rodney Strong Vineyards in Windsor, Calif., in Sonoma
County, has sold wine by mail for more than 30 years. Windsor sells
only its own wines, generally priced at $9 to $20. Its specialty is
personalizing the labels for weddings and birthdays.
</P>
<P>
   Mail-order wine is billed as a bargain but rarely is, if for no
other reason than that the customer must pay shipping charges.
Money-saving claims are difficult to back up because many of the
labels are obscure or unknown. Knowledgeable customers can usually
do just as well or better in wine shops.
</P>
<P>
   Wine by mail rarely attracts savvy customers. While some
wine-club clients prefer mail-order wine because of the convenience
or because they have no good wine shops nearby, others are
attracted to it because they know little about wine and prefer
having someone else select it for them.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks Brothers Cellar subscribers can order two bottles of wine
a month for a minimum of three months for a total of $90, or $15 a
bottle. The shipping charge, $6.95 a month, will be waived for the
first month for the store's charge-card holders.
</P>
<P>
   Members can select the color of their wines _ all red, all white
or a mixed order of red and white _ but not the wines themselves.
No need for concern, Brooks Brothers says. Its brochure assures
that ``these are wines to remember; full-bodied, crisp, or
classic.''
</P>
<P>
   How does a clothing business come to address its customers in
wine jargon? It hires someone else to do the job. Brooks Brothers'
program is run by Geerlings &AMP; Wade, a 20-year-old direct marketer
of wine and wine-associated products in Canton, Mass., near Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Geerlings &AMP; Wade sells directly to most of its customers,
attracting them to its own wine club through brochures, catalogs
and telephone sales. It has also run programs like the one it has
set up for Brooks Brothers. ``We've done them for Century 21 and
the Brookstone chain,'' said Jay Essa, the president and chief
executive, referring to the real estate company and the catalog and
retail concern.
</P>
<P>
   Geerlings &AMP; Wade's own customers can buy its wines only in six-
and 12-bottle cases. Prices range from as little as $7 a bottle to
as much as $80 for a wide variety of domestic and imported wines.
</P>
<P>
   The more expensive labels often bear familiar names like Joseph
Phelps, the Napa Valley winery, and the Hospice de Beaune in
Burgundy, but the lower-priced wines often have little-known or
unknown names. In fact, Geerlings &AMP; Wade owns more than 20 names,
which it uses on domestic wines it buys at low prices in the
California bulk-wine market.
</P>
<P>
   Its customers can be excused for being confused by names like
Glass Ridge, J. Krant Cellars, Lapis Lazuli Winery and Vineyards,
Rose Valley and St. Carolyne Winery. These places don't exist; they
are brand names Geerlings &AMP; Wade can use as it sees fit.
</P>
<P>
   Should Brooks Brothers Cellar members be more demanding,
Geerlings &AMP; Wade will almost certainly be ready to oblige them. Its
current catalog offers fine Bordeaux like Chateau Clerc Milon and
California cabernets like Joseph Phelps' Insignia at prices up to
$840 a case, about what they cost in retail shops.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks Brothers is entering wine by mail at a time when the
business is under broad attack from part of the wine trade and from
the government. Wine sales are regulated by a bewildering array of
laws that vary from state to state but generally require winemakers
and importers to sell only to licensed distributors, who are then
required to sell only to licensed retailers. Direct-mail operators
are accused of bypassing this three-tiered system and also of
avoiding state taxes the distributors must pay.
</P>
<P>
   Wine distributors are solidly opposed to any form of wine by
mail and, under pressure from them, many states have been
tightening the rules. Geerlings &AMP; Wade says it conforms to the
system by holding retail licenses for warehouses in 14 states that
are supplied by licensed distributors. It collects taxes in all
states where the law requires it to, Essa said. ``We're confident
that we're in compliance with the laws wherever we operate,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   But Brooks Brothers' principal concern is, of course, customer
response to an untried venture. If it works, buttoned-down merlot
may not be so far-fetched after all.

AZNAVOUR, THE LAST CHANTEUR 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Oct. 18) 
(JT) 
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Charles Aznavour may well be the only person who
remembers his first visit to New York, in 1948. He was 24, poor,
and spoke no English, but he was eager for adventure. Edith Piaf
had invited him to accompany her to the United States _ as a
friend, not a lover, he insists _ and the ``little sparrow'' helped
him find a few gigs of his own. More important, this short, wiry
Frenchman entered a world of music in which he felt immediately at
home. He already knew the work of Cole Porter, George Gershwin and
Jerome Kern, and now he discovered Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington
and Dizzy Gillespie.
</P>
<P>
   When he next visited New York, in 1963, Aznavour had already
made it as a singer, songwriter and actor in Europe, but he was
still largely unknown in the United States. This time, he was
determined to be noticed. He rented Carnegie Hall and, helped by a
television appearance on the Jack Parr show and by his starring
role in Francois Truffaut's hit movie ``Shoot the Piano Player,''
his concert was a sellout. ``No one knew me, except they had seen
the film and they thought I played the piano,'' he recalled with
amusement. ``I don't play the piano.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, as Aznavour embarks on a new American tour, public
recognition is the least of his problems. Having sold close to 100
million albums (his latest is ``Plus Bleu ...''), he now enjoys the
magical status of international musical legend. Indeed, after the
death of Frank Sinatra, he may well be the last practitioner of a
song tradition that dates back to the 1940s. Yet he is no relic
from the past. At 74, as energetic and good-humored as ever, he
remains a performer extraordinaire. Starting Tuesday, he will be
appearing through Nov. 1 at the Marquis Theater on Broadway. He
will take the same show to the Wilshire Theater in Los Angeles from
Nov. 19 through Nov. 24.
</P>
<P>
   For all his world travels, though, Aznavour's American tours are
special to him, not least because they always raise a teasing
question: Would he also have become a celebrity if, as was almost
the case, he had been born an American? When his Armenian parents _
his singer father, Micha, and actress mother, Knar _ arrived in
Paris in 1920, their intention was to travel on to the United
States. And if their visas had come through quickly, Charles
Aznavourian (his original surname) would no doubt have been born in
the New World. Instead, he became a Frenchman, and his family
settled here. Eventually, he learned English (through the songs of
Fred Astaire, Mel Torme and Frank Sinatra, he notes), but as a
third language.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, his upbringing in Paris was as cosmopolitan as it
would have been in the New York of the 1920s and 1930s. His
parents, already part of the Armenian diaspora provoked by Turkish
persecution, were born in Georgia and his father spoke Yiddish as
well as Russian and Armenian. Further, in Paris, where his father
ran a small Armenian restaurant to supplement his earnings as a
singer and where Charles went to French primary school to learn of
``our ancestors, the Gauls,'' the family lived in the heart of the
Jewish community of the Marais.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my childhood friends are Jews,'' Aznavour said in a recent
interview in his son's office at Editions Breton, one of several
music publishers that Aznavour now owns. ``I was brought up among
them. I finished up having the same gestures, the same way of
talking, the same way of joking. During the German occupation, I
was arrested several times for being Jewish. Shall we say, I don't
have a very Catholic appearance. They'd take me to the command
post. I'd show my baptism certificate, but they didn't believe me.
They'd make me take down my trousers. As I tell my friends, I am
the only Ashkenazi goy in France.''
</P>
<P>
   Aznavour's musical education, albeit informal, was no less
international. His father taught him Russian, Jewish, gypsy,
Italian and Armenian songs. He felt drawn to American music _
Josephine Baker had led an invasion of Paris by black American
musicians and entertainers _ and he loved the tangos of Carlos
Gardel. Years later, he discovered Arab, Iranian and Spanish music.
And, in time, he concluded that his highly distinct tenor voice,
with its raspy nasal color, had a Mediterranean quality that
appealed to a variety of audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jews like my voice because it has a bit of the
cantor,'' he mused. ``I have North African followers because my
voice also has something of the muezzin. It's an Eastern voice. I
have an Eastern voice and a Western way of writing songs. Not that
I have a particular musical style. In fact, I don't think there is
a French musical style. The rhythms have always come from abroad _
tango, rock, jazz, samba, bossa nova. Perhaps only the French
accordion is special.''

 PARIS: is special.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   And yet Aznavour sounds so quintessentially French, so much part
of a rich tradition of chanson Francaise, which over the last 60
years has included Maurice Chevalier, Charles Trenet (now 85 years
old and retired, but still Aznavour's role model), Georges
Brassens, Jacques Brel, Leo Ferre, Yves Montand, Gilbert Becaud,
Juliette Greco, Barbara and, of course, Edith Piaf.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chanson Francaise is the text,'' he explained. ``It's the
text that conditions the music. It's curious. Most French
songwriters are people without high school education, like me. I
left school at 11. They're people who come from the streets. In the
chanson Francaise, a sort of street wisdom suddenly becomes
literature. It's the same principle as country-western music in the
United States. Also rap and the troubadour tradition of Arab music.
The songs tell stories, sometimes puerile, but always well
written.''
</P>
<P>
   What immediately distinguished Aznavour from his peers was that
he wrote his own songs. In fact, while still unknown as a
performer, he wrote songs for Piaf, Becaud, Ms. Greco and Eddie
Constantine. Years later, vocalists around the world continued to
tap his songs, including those that became hits in English, like
``Yesterday, When I Was Young'' (recorded by Bing Crosby), ``La
Mamma'' (recorded by Ray Charles), ``She'' and ``Take Me Along.''
But with the exception of medleys sung in joint appearances with
Pia Zadora and Liza Minnelli in recent years, Aznavour has always
sung his own words and often his own music. Thrice married with
four children, presumably his own wanderings through life and love
have given him a tale or two to recount.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always start with the words,'' he said of his method of
creating. ``First there is a phrase, like `you must know,' or `I
could see myself' or just `however' _ things people say every day.
People would tell me, `You know, we say lots of things taken from
your songs.' But that's not true. I just repeat what I often hear.
That's what makes the chanson populaire. Then there are the songs
based on social issues. These are not hits, but they work very well
on stage. Men who drink, AIDS, traffic accidents, divorce, children
in times of war, a man in love with a deaf-mute woman. They are my
trademark. The chansons populaires are show business. These are
Aznavour.''
</P>
<P>
   Some songs are a few hours in the making, others a few years. He
discovered, for example, that the French language works well for
swing but that its words are too long for jazz, which naturally
prompted him to write using short words. When he is satisfied with
the lyrics, he then sits down at a piano to work out the melody. If
it comes, all well and good; if it does not, he turns to another
composer. In one case, ``Tu te laisses aller,'' he recalled, it was
12 years before he came up with a tune that pleased him. In his
latest album, though, he does something unusual. Inspired by duets
recorded by Natalie Cole using old soundtracks of her father, Nat
(King) Cole, Aznavour has recorded a ``virtual duet'' with Edith
Piaf of the title song, ``Plus Bleu.''

KIDS GET THEIR OWN PIECE OF SAN FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GERALD D. ADAMS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The late real estate developer Ben Swig would be
appalled at the idea: setting aside an entire block of downtown San
Francisco just for children.
</P>
<P>
   Swig, owner of the Fairmont Hotel, proposed in 1954 that Yerba
Buena Center's 87 acres be reserved for a sports arena, multilevel
parking garages and a convention center _ uses that would be good
for business.
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday, surrounded by some of San Francisco's most
high-priced turf, nearly 10 acres of real estate atop the Moscone
Convention Center was opened for children.
</P>
<P>
   For a downtown devoted almost exclusively to grown-ups and
commerce the new Rooftop at Yerba Buena Gardens is an anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   The $60 million project, originally called the Children's
Center, is a modern playground for children of all ages. It
includes:
</P>
<P>
   _ A permanent ice skating rink.
</P>
<P>
   _ A 12-lane bowling alley.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Zeum, an upside-down cone where kids can learn creative
arts using the latest in computer technology.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gardens where they can learn to cultivate vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   _ An amphitheater.
</P>
<P>
   _ A 95-year-old carousel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fantastic thing,'' attorney John Sanger, a Zeum
board member, said of the Rooftop complex.
</P>
<P>
   Considering political and financial problems, the children's
center also is a political miracle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to fight. This was always the stepchild,''
environmental lawyer Sue Hestor said. ``There was this fantasy that
everything (built at Yerba Buena) be huge revenue generators
instead of for residents of the city and their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the struggle to claim a block for children has taken at
least two decades of politicking and the lobbying of four mayors,
several Redevelopment Agency executive directors and dozens of
redevelopment commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a lot of perseverance, hard work, politics and
badgering,'' said Douglas Engmann, a member of the late Mayor
George Moscone's original Select Committee on Yerba Buena. That
committee's consensus in the late 1970s revived what had been a
moribund redevelopment project.
</P>
<P>
   As to badgering, the chief self-described ``badger'' through two
decades was Supervisor Sue Bierman, who championed the idea of
restoring the Playland carousel at Yerba Buena through her 16-year
career as a planning commissioner before joining the Board of
Supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think of all the time I spent in those meetings,
glaring like a mother superior ...'' Bierman laughingly recalled.
``But we got it, especially the carousel.''
</P>
<P>
   Bierman credits architect Richard Gryziec with conceiving of the
idea of a children's block during the 1970s when he persistently
submitted potential sketches to the Redevelopment Agency.
</P>
<P>
   One major effort centered on restoring the antique carousel. The
merry-go-round was decaying at a Long Beach shopping center until
Bierman and the carousel owner, Marianne Stevens of Rosewell, N.M.,
managed to get it back to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   First installed in 1906 at a park in Seattle, the Playland
carousel is a child's fantasy of mirrored walls, poles of brass and
reflecting jewels, together with horses, giraffes, rams, camels and
chariots, all hand-crafted by craftsman Charles I.D. Looff.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the success in recovering the carousel and setting aside
the block for children, an additional problem threatened the
children's center: the lack of money to construct it.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Bob Gamble, the former chief fiscal officer for the
Redevelopment Agency, who suggested using the city's sacrosanct
hotel tax fund _ rather than Redevelopment Agency revenues _ to
finance a major portion of the children's block.
</P>
<P>
   ``That met with less than overwhelming enthusiasm from some
quarters,'' Gamble recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism industry representatives ``have always viewed hotel tax
revenues as their province, directly related to filling hotel
rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Untouchable as that treasury was, his proposal caught on. With
grassroots enthusiasm for the children's project rising, and key
support from Redevelopment Commissioner Leroy King, ``That helped
us to overcome any potential opposition,'' Gamble said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the $60 million cost of the children's block is financed
by bonds backed by the city's 14 percent hotel tax.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When I opened my own pastry shop last year, I wanted
the selection of pastries, cakes and chocolates to be so dazzling
that people would not only have trouble deciding what to taste
first, but also wonder how everything was made. Most of what we do
at the shop is pretty complicated, and after all, if everyone could
make these sweets at home, who'd need us?
</P>
<P>
   But in fact I have a large repertory of desserts that anyone can
do at home _they're the desserts I prepare on my day off and the
ones that my wife, Alexandra, makes for friends. For the next eight
weeks, these are the desserts I'm going to share with you, starting
with a pain d'epices from my childhood.
</P>
<P>
   All through my school years, my 4 o'clock snack was always the
same: Van Damme's pain d'epices _ literally spice bread, in
reality, a cross between a honey cake and a spice loaf.
</P>
<P>
   Even though my father and my grandfather were pastry chefs, I
got the same straight-from-the-grocery cake everyone else did.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, still in love with the memory of Van Damme's, I
decided to do my own version, one with deeper flavor and lots more
add-ins. My pain d'epices is three-quarters nuts and dried fruits.
When you cut a slice you see a mosaic of ingredients held together
by the batter, which is nothing more than honey, water, sugar,
flour and fragrant spices. There are no eggs and no butter in the
cake, a rarity in the annals of pastry.
</P>
<P>
   I like to use strongly flavored pine honey for this cake, and
although you can use just two or three different kinds of fruits
and nuts, I urge you to get as many varieties as you can into the
mix; it will make every bite of the cake that much more exciting.
</P>
<P>
   This recipe makes four small loaves. There's no reason to cut
the recipe down, because this cake is an excellent keeper. In fact,
it should not really be eaten until three days after it's made: Its
flavors need time to ripen. In addition, this cake is great toasted
for breakfast and superb with savory foods.
</P>
<P>
   At the bistro, Philippe Bertineau, our executive chef, brushes
slices of pain d'epices with clarified butter, runs them under the
broiler for a crisping, and serves the toast alongside equally
spicy shrimp with lemon, capers and herbs. Pain d'epices has almost
as many uses as it does spices, nuts and fruits.
</P>
<P>
   PAIN D'EPICES
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour 15 minutes, plus cooling
</P>
<P>
   Butter for greasing pans
</P>
<P>
   Flour for dusting pans
</P>
<P>
   2 cups nuts, preferably a mix of sliced almonds, slivered
almonds, skinned pistachios, skinned hazelnuts, walnut halves and
pine nuts
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dried fruit cut in 1/4-inch dice, preferably equal amounts
of apricots, figs, prunes and dates
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup dark raisins
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup golden raisins
</P>
<P>
   Finely grated zest of 1 lemon
</P>
<P>
   Finely grated zest of 1 orange
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons baking soda
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon pastis or other anise-flavored liqueur
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon ground cloves (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of salt
</P>
<P>
   1 cup pine honey, or other strongly flavored honey
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons dark rum
</P>
<P>
   2 pieces star anise, tied in cheesecloth
</P>
<P>
   3 cups all-purpose flour, sifted.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter four aluminum-foil baby
loaf pans, each 5 3/4 inches by 3 1/4 inches by 2 inches. Dust the
insides with flour, and tap out excess. Place pans on baking sheet;
set aside. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. In large mixing bowl, combine nuts, diced fruit, dark
raisins, golden raisins, lemon zest and orange zest. Mix well. Add
baking soda, pastis, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and salt. Stir to
mix. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. In medium saucepan over medium heat, combine 1 3/4 cups water
with honey, sugar, rum and star anise. Bring to boil, and
immediately remove from heat. Remove and discard star anise. Pour
liquid into bowl of fruit and nuts, and stir gently. Let mixture
rest for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add all-purpose flour,
stir well and let rest for 2 or 3 minutes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4. Divide batter among the pans; the pans will be about 3/4
full. Place baking sheet in oven. Bake until knife inserted in
center of cakes comes out with the tiniest bit of moist batter at
the tip, 45 to 50 minutes. (Check cakes after 20 minutes of baking;
if at any time the cakes appear to be browning too quickly, cover
them loosely with tent of aluminum foil.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5. Transfer cakes to a rack, and cool to room temperature.
Unmold, and wrap in plastic film. To serve, cut into thin slices.
The cakes are best after ripening for three days at room
temperature. If sealed in airtight wrap, they may be frozen for a
month. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 small loaves. &QL;

 &HT;    ISRAELIS, PALESTINIANS SKEPTICAL OF PEACE TALKS' POSSIBLE
OUTCOMES
 &HT;    EDs: Optional add begins at 700 words.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The murder of an Israeli Tuesday in what police here
called a terrorist attack sent tremors through the preparations for
peace talks in Maryland this week.
</P>
<P>
   Two Israelis were shot while swimming in a spring near
Jerusalem, one died. The assailants fled in the victims' car,
apparently toward a Palestinian-controlled area.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said that, in light of the shooting, ``there is no chance of an
agreement being signed at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the terse statement may be just a reiteration of
Netanyahu's consistent push for the Palestinians to fight terror
before Israel will hand over any more land under the Oslo peace
process. It might not preclude a success this weekend at the summit
hosted by President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't rule anything out,'' said Israeli government
spokesman Moshe Fogel. ``There is no reason why we shouldn't reach
an agreement if the Palestinians fill in the details with regard to
fighting terror.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal that will be under discussion at the Middle East summit
meeting starting on Thursday would be a small, but needed, step in
softening the disappointment Palestinians and Israelis feel for the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen months of deadlock have hardened their deep distrust in
each other and their leaders. Israelis and Palestinians alike, say
they are tired of pointless meetings and handshakes disguised as
progress.
</P>
<P>
   The talks center on an American proposal -- initially agreed to
months ago by the Palestinians -- in which Israel would pull its
army out of more land in the West Bank territory it captured in
1967. In exchange, Palestinians would have to crack down on
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu Tuesday met with his Cabinet, and some right-wing
allies threatened to topple his government if he gives away too
much in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis are divided over whether an agreement hammered out in
the United States would be good or bad for their safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a small step forward,'' said Yaron Meir, a retired
Israeli laborer who sipped coffee this week at a Jerusalem mall.
``I know you can't trust Arabs. The main thing is that no more
blood is shed.''
</P>
<P>
   At a table nearby sat Meir Uhamkin, 30, in a black skullcap. He
is a member of the large Lubavitch Orthodox Jewish group, which
teaches that Israel should give away none of its biblical land. He
hopes the summit ends in deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope nothing will come of it,'' said Uhamkin, who inspects
the Kosher practices at a restaurant in the mall's food court. ``My
position is according to (Jewish law), that you cannot give an
inch.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians, meanwhile, are still surrounded by Israeli
checkpoints and Jewish settlements. They will take what they can
get, but do not expect much.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not achieving anything, just promises and promises,''
Fathi El-Hawari, a 52-year-old Palestinian electrician who often
has to sneak around Israeli soldiers to travel from his home in the
West Bank city of Ramallah to jobs in Jerusalem. ``The people are
so sick and tired of what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to his anxiety is the widely-held belief among
Palestinians that the United States favors its ally, Israel in the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   The Oslo peace process, begun in 1993, set out a schedule of
unspecified Israeli army pull- backs from the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip. These Palestinian areas were captured in the 1967
war.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Gaza Strip is now controlled by Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian National Authority. About three percent of the West
Bank -- including its eight largest cities -- are under PNA
control, and another 24 percent is controlled by Arafat in civil
matters but still patrolled by Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian-controlled areas remain divided into more than
150 pockets surrounded by Israeli areas and Jewish settlements, the
latter neighborhoods now house more than 160,000 Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   No land has been handed over since January 1997. The pull-backs
were supposed to lead to negotiations over the toughest issues,
including settlements and Jerusalem, at final talks. The process
expires May 4, when Arafat says he will declare Palestinian
statehood over Israeli objections.
</P>
<P>
   The American proposal would have Israel turn over another 13
percent of West Bank land. The hand-over could be broken into
stages, with the Palestinians required to take security steps along
the way.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The deal could also include requirements, sought by the
Palestinians, that Israel stop expanding the West Bank settlements
and allow the opening of an airport and an industrial center in the
Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, American negotiators are asking Arafat to accept a
schedule of 50 specific anti-terrorist actions. Also, there will be
work on an agreement on security procedures, brokered by the CIA,
that the Palestinians have accepted and the Israelis have not.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said three ``major gaps''
exist between the two sides, including whether Israel will: Agree
to crack down on Jewish extremists who have threatened
Palestinians, stop settlement expansion and withdraw troops
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   But, Israelis shift the burden to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu spokesman David Bar-Illan said Israel still insists
that the leadership of the PLO, the international Palestinian
organization also headed by Arafat, convene and amend the
anti-Israel portions of its charter. Arafat once convened the PLO
to begin the revision process, but it was not completed.

NEW GUIDE BRINGS ALIVE A CENTER OF POLISH JEWRY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 18) 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland _ Increasingly, American Jews are traveling to
Poland to unearth family histories or to revisit a past that is
painfully known. These are often moving and solemn trips taken for
emotional and personal reasons. Now a carefully researched
guidebook has come along that concentrates on Jewish history,
people and places in eastern Poland and its main border city,
Bialystok.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``Jewish Bialystok and Surroundings in Eastern Poland,''
the guide is written by Tomasz Wisniewski, a 40-year-old journalist
who was jailed by the Communists during martial law in the 1980s
for his dissident activities. Wisniewski, who is not Jewish, spent
his time in prison researching the region's Jewish heritage and
learning basic Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   In contemporary Poland, Bialystok has turned itself from a drab
Communist outpost into a bustling market town where traders from
the former Soviet Union hawk their goods and then move west. Before
World War II, Bialystok's population was more than 60 percent
Jewish, giving it the highest concentration of Jews of any city in
the world, Wisniewski writes.
</P>
<P>
   Historians have estimated that 200,000 Jews from the Bialystok
region were murdered during the war, with about 60,000 of them
taken from the ghetto in the city. Today, only about half a dozen
Jews live in the city, which was largely rebuilt after heavy
destruction in the war.
</P>
<P>
   To get a sense of what Jewish Bialystok was like, Wisniewski has
myriad suggestions. Here are just a few places to visit:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Jewish Cemetery on Wschodnia Street, the largest Jewish
burial site in northern Poland. The Germans removed many of the
burial stones, but about 7,000 remain in the 30-acre site. Of
interest to New Yorkers is a 1922 memorial to Rabbi Chaim Herc
Halpern, who was chief rabbi in Bialystok for more than 50 years.
The memorial was a gift of Bialystok Jews living in New York. To
the right of the Halpern memorial is a black marble pillar
commemorating the victims of the Jewish pogrom in 1906.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Synagogue at Branickiego Street, destroyed during World
War II, was partly rebuilt for use as a movie house and then a
sports hall. At the back of the building, some characteristic
Jewish architectural details were included, like high half-rounded
windows and a small apse. A plaque describing the synagogue's
history was added in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Hebrew Gymnasium at 79 Sienkiewicza Street, now a
hospital, was the leading Jewish school in Bialystok and one of the
finest academies in pre-World War II Poland. Graduates, among them
former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, celebrated the 70th
anniversary of the school in 1990 at a reunion in Haifa, Israel.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Tykocin, about 20 miles west of Bialystok, stands the Great
Synagogue, built in 1642 and considered one of the best-preserved
sites of Orthodox Jewry in Poland. The synagogue, a fortified
square structure with a high mansard roof, was heavily damaged by
the Nazis but was rebuilt after the war and is a museum. Services
are held at the request of visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Wisniewski says that small evocative details can allow visitors
to reach back to the past. He mentions the stamp of the Sholem
Aleichem Jewish Library found on an old book in an antiquarian book
store or the empty space a mezuzah once occupied, or a detail from
a Star of David on a wall. His book includes period photographs
that help recreate the lost landscape of Jewish life.
</P>
<P>
   Bialystok is about three hours by car from Warsaw, but it can
also be reached by train or bus.
</P>
<P>
   Wisniewski also points out that halfway between Warsaw and
Bialystok, visitors can stop at Treblinka, the death camp where the
Nazis killed more than 800,000 Jews. The site has been transformed
into a field of symbolic tombstones, each one representing a town
whose Jewish residents were killed in the camp.
</P>
<P>
   The foreword to the guide is by the food critic Mimi Sheraton,
whose forebears came from other parts of Poland, but who became
enchanted with the town when she traveled there to try bialys on
their home ground for a book she is writing. Her researcher was
Tomasz Wisniewski.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jewish Bialystok and Surroundings in Eastern Poland'' can be
ordered through the Ipswich Press, Post Office Box 291, Ipswich,
Mass. 01938. It costs $12.95; add $2.95 postage for the first copy,
50 cents for each additional one. It is also available from
www.amazon.com.
</P>
<P>

his research on synagogues in eastern Poland, see the Web site

 By ALAN RIDING    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEEDS, England _ There is something rather touching about Ian
McKellen's new enthusiasm for cinema. During a long stage career,
he has won all the honors (including a knighthood) that are the due
of great English actors. His interpretations of such roles as
Macbeth, Iago, Richard III and Uncle Vanya are considered
generational benchmarks. Yet now, at 59, he has acquired an
appetite to work in movies, to do what for the best part of four
decades he found unappealing.
</P>
<P>
   Is it fame that he is after? Although long a favorite of London
theatergoers, McKellen has neither the name nor face recognition
that movies and television bring. Yet this slim, good-natured actor
insists that he is not yearning for greater fame or fortune. An
enhanced reputation, he says, has just one purpose at this juncture
of his life: to help him obtain good screen roles.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, he is on the right track with the release of two new
movies in which he plays the lead role. In Bryan Singer's ``Apt
Pupil,'' which opens Friday, he appears as a Nazi war criminal
hiding out in an American town in the early 1980s in a story based
on Stephen King's novella of the same name. In Bill Condon's ``Gods
and Monsters,'' which opens Nov. 4, he portrays James Whale, the
Hollywood movie director best known for making ``Frankenstein'' and
``The Bride of Frankenstein'' in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I did the movie of `Richard III,' I thought, this has an
excitement that I have not felt before,'' McKellen said during an
interview here in Leeds, where he is rehearsing the first of three
successive stage roles at the West Yorkshire Playhouse. ``And I
wanted to do more. I have only come back to theater now because I
was enjoying movies so much that I thought, maybe I won't act again
in the old way. I wasn't missing theater, and I wanted to know if I
still enjoyed it. I do _ but I'm now missing films.''
</P>
<P>
   While McKellen had previously played small roles in big films
and big roles in small films, it was Shakespeare's most villainous
English monarch that led him to discover the joy of moviemaking.
Richard Loncraine's 1995 film version of ``Richard III'' was
inspired by Richard Eyre's 1992 stage production, in which McKellen
also appeared (in London and at the Brooklyn Academy of Music) as
the kind of uniformed 1930s tyrant who might have seized power in
Britain had Naziism crossed the Channel. But the film was
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of the film because it was cinema,'' McKellen
said, puffing on a cigarette. ``It was not the play and was never
intended to be. I was credited as co-writer with the director, but
it was a film written by William Shakespeare _ just that he didn't
know he had written it. But I was not going to do anything that I
didn't think Shakespeare would have approved of had he been making
the film. If it didn't work, it was my fault; if people liked it,
they liked it because it was by Shakespeare.''
</P>
<P>
   The film won McKellen a Golden Globe nomination for best actor
and a Felix Award as best European actor of the year, although he
might well have worried about typecasting when he took the part of
the fugitive Nazi, Kurt Dussander, in ``Apt Pupil.'' Had his
Richard III escaped to America?
</P>
<P>
   Living under the assumed name of Arthur Denker, the octogenarian
Dussander is a heavy-drinking recluse whose dark past is discovered
by Todd Bowden (Brad Renfro), a high school student with an
obsessive interest in the Holocaust. Todd's purpose, though, is not
to denounce Dussander but rather to blackmail him into recounting
in detail the atrocities that he committed and witnessed in German
death camps. Todd even rents a theater costume of an SS uniform and
forces Dussander to wear it. But the old Nazi is not bereft of
cunning, and he gradually draws the young man into his own net of
evil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the fate of most middle-aged actors, particularly with my
background, that you get asked to play Nazis or villains or
odd-ball characters,'' McKellen noted, ``or else you become an
ersatz American, as Tony Hopkins, Gary Oldman and Tim Roth
occasionally do. In other words, I don't get sent that many scripts
with leading parts in them. In this case, it was directed by Bryan
Singer, riding high from `The Usual Suspects.' There was also the
challenge of being convincingly 25 years older than I am and having
an Essen-cum-Southern California accent. It just seemed too good a
treat.''
</P>
<P>
   So he enjoyed playing this personification of diablerie?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great fun,'' he said with a laugh.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   In contrast, his role in ``Gods and Monsters'' has echoes of the
real Ian McKellen: James Whale had also been an actor on the London
stage, became an Englishman-in-Hollywood and was openly gay. Not
that McKellen had heard of Whale before he read ``Father of
Frankenstein,'' a 1995 novel by Christopher Bram. The book imagines
the weeks before the director's death in 1957 when he was found at
the bottom of his swimming pool; it was adapted by Condon for
``Gods and Monsters.'' But when this gay English actor looking for
a Hollywood role read what he called a ``beautifully written''
screenplay, he felt the part had been written for him.
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, he knows a great deal more about Whale, who made
no fewer than 21 films between 1930 and 1941. The Frankenstein
movies keep his name alive today, but Whale also directed
``Journey's End,'' ``Show Boat'' and ``The Man in the Iron Mask''
(four of his horror films will be shown at the Film Forum in New
York Oct. 30 through Nov. 12 as part of a series called ``Universal
Horror'').
</P>
<P>
   After falling out with Universal Studios in the early 1940s,
Whale then retired to a mansion in Pacific Palisades, where he
painted and partied until shortly before his suicide at the age of
61.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Gods and Monsters,'' which played recently at the New York
Film Festival, an elegant white-haired Whale, weakened by a stroke,
is captivated by a hunky former Marine-turned-gardener, Clayton
Boone (Brendan Fraser), whom he persuades to sit as a model for
sketching. With Hannah the housekeeper (Lynn Redgrave) constantly
fussing around, the unsophisticated _ and heterosexual _ Clayton
gradually understands that Whale is gay and must have ulterior
motives. But when he sees ``Frankenstein'' on television, he comes
to appreciate Whale's talent, which Condon exhibits through
flashbacks to the making of the horror films. Above all, though,
``Gods and Monsters'' is a poignant character study of an old gay
artist looking back on his life.
</P>
<P>
   In a review in The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote that
McKellen's performance ``richly deserves to be remembered at the
end of the year.'' And she added: ``What especially elevates (the
movie) is the razor-sharp cleverness of McKellen's performance,
which brings unusual fullness and feeling to a most unusual man.''
</P>
<P>
   Did it worry McKellen to be playing a sad old gay?
</P>
<P>
   The question was intentionally provocative because, although
McKellen's sexual preference was never a secret in theater circles,
he went public with his homosexuality 10 years ago and has since
campaigned vocally for gay rights and sexual equality in Britain.
So, the question implied, was he reinforcing a stereotype by
playing a ``sad old gay''?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said firmly. ``Ten years ago, this might have been
true. But Whale's character rings true. He was a fighter. He got
out of his industrial hometown in the Midlands, he survived World
War I, he trained himself as a graphic artist, he had a good career
as an actor in London, he was Hollywood's most famous director for
15 years, so I think that he had a really good life.''
</P>
<P>
   And, no doubt, the same could be said of McKellen, who also
fought his way out of a Lancashire mill town to win a place at
Cambridge University, then moved quickly through regional repertory
companies to become a pillar of the English theater, with stretches
at the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Royal National Theater and
a yearlong run in 1978 on Broadway as Salieri in ``Amadeus.'' He
jokes that when the likes of Albert Finney and Peter O'Toole opted
for movie careers, they allowed him and Derek Jacobi to assume the
great Shakespearean roles. Now, younger actors play Hamlet and
Romeo, but McKellen continues to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``His peers and the critics perceive new depths, a finer
sensitivity,'' Robert Chesshyre wrote in a profile of him for the
London Daily Telegraph some years ago. ``He has tempered his
intermittent weakness, the tendency to dramatic pyrotechnics, with
a more emotional vein that comes from somewhere near his soul.''
</P>
<P>
   For this, McKellen has a simple explanation. Coming out, he
said, enabled him to ``enter the world'' and contribute something
to society, to try to practice his preacher grandfathers' belief
that ``you are in this world to make it a better place for other
people.'' But it also changed his approach to acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't fake emotion any longer as an actor,'' he explained.
``I don't pretend. I actually experience it. I've been trying to do
that all my life, but I find it easier now to go straight into the
emotion. I can be angry. For years I couldn't be angry. I could be
angry with myself, but I couldn't feel real anger _ and now I can.
That's why it's so good for people to come out. Being `in a closet'
is a good image: you're in there, you're enclosed, you can't
express yourself. Now I even have a Web site. I'm more voluble than
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. When he recently moved to Leeds to perform at the West
Yorkshire Playhouse in ``The Seagull,'' ``Present Laughter'' and
``The Tempest,'' he publicly bemoaned the ``impersonal audiences''
of London theaters and celebrated the chance to act before a local
community. Suddenly British newspapers were speculating about
McKellen's ``plan'' to boycott London, and Peter Hall, the veteran
theater director, was expressing admiration at the actor's
``expert'' manipulation of the media. ``Sir Ian will not appear on
the London stage again,'' Hall noted, ``until he appears on the
London stage again.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, by early spring, after he has spoken Prospero's Epilogue
here for the last time, McKellen seems far more likely to head to
Hollywood than London. Or at least that is his wish, because that
is where his new challenge lies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much easier to have a long career in the theater,'' he
said. ``It's almost expected of you. After 30 years, the respect
begins to flow. But in cinema, there's a ranking that changes
almost month by month, and very odd people are not on the list.
Well, I'd like to be on the list of the bankable screen actors so
that any part that I want to play might come my way. Life doesn't
begin at 40; it begins at 50. At least it did for me. I've got a
whole new lease on life.''

RURAL HOSPITAL ISN'T TAKING MILLENNIUM BUG FOR GRANTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROGER CROTEAU  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEGUIN, Texas _ At midnight on Dec. 31, 1999, a health care
worker will be stationed at the bed of every patient in the
Guadalupe Valley Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The workers all will be holding flashlights _ just in case the
millennium bug bites.
</P>
<P>
   Computer experts fear that computers and other electronic
equipment originally programmed to recognize only the last two
digits of a year will fail or malfunction on Jan. 1, 2000, when the
machines will assume it is 1900. This is known various as the
millennium bug, the year 2000 problem or YK2 problem.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals, like this rural South Texas facility of fewer than
100 beds, aren't immune.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, Don Richey, the hospital administrator, got a
call from a supplier who told him all four of the hospital's
anesthesia machines would quit working on Jan. 1, 2000, and must be
replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each machine costs $40,000,'' Richey said. ``I told them, `We
may need to replace them, but we won't buy the replacement machines
from you.' Then a miracle happened. Two days later he called back
and told me the machines could be fixed for $1,000 each.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's just four machines in a hospital with literally
thousands of pieces of equipment with embedded microchips that
could malfunction when the calender and its electronic counterparts
turn to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   While all businesses have to deal with the potential problems of
the year 2000 problem, hospitals depend on equipment to keep people
alive. Consequently, they have a bigger stake in ensuring the
transition to 2000 goes smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Making sure Guadalupe Valley Hospital makes the transition
without problems is the job of the associate administrator, Robert
Haynes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not spending long, sleepless nights worrying about it, but
I am working long days so we can have a clue what will happen,''
Haynes said. ``We will do what we can to make sure everything is
Y2K compliant, but we will have contingencies built in to have a
backup ready if anything fails.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Y2K compliant'' is a phrase that may edge out ``Happy New
Year'' by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Guadalupe Valley Hospital is making an inventory of
every piece of equipment that has a computer chip in it and working
closely with the hospital's vendors about potential Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   It's a slow process.
</P>
<P>
   The operating room, for example, has 87 pieces of equipment, 70
of which are considered critical to patient care. Hospital
officials don't know yet if a single piece of that equipment will
malfunction after 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be ready,'' Haynes said. `I am not going to be 100
percent confident about anything, but I'm going to try to be as
sure as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with the Y2K bug is not cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Richey said the cost for his small hospital would be ``in the
hundreds of thousands of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The hospital recently replaced its entire phone system for
$200,000. Richey said the system was old and needed to be replaced
within the next few years anyway. But the fact it was not Y2K
compliant sped its replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking this Y2K situation and using it to upgrade our
equipment over a three-year period,'' he said.

TAKEOUT, PUCCINI AND CHUTZPAH: EATZI'S TAKES ON MANHATTAN

 By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's not a restaurant. It's not a grocery store. It's
Eatzi's Market &AMP; Bakery, the food store that ate Dallas. Now, in
the boldest out-of-town incursion since George Steinbrenner bought
the Yankees, it has planted its cowboy boots right in Macy's
basement.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing shy about Eatzi's, which opens its doors to New
Yorkers on Friday. As stunned shoppers in Dallas, Houston and
Atlanta already know, and as Long Islanders who frequent the Carle
Place Shopping Center near Old Westbury are learning, Eatzi's means
high energy and high volume (in both senses of the word).
</P>
<P>
   It's a prepared-food store in which dozens of chefs, working in
open kitchens, turn out hundreds of dishes every day, with Puccini
arias blasting away in the background.
</P>
<P>
   The Macy's opening is a high-stakes gamble for Eatzi's. Less
than three years after opening its first store in Dallas, it is
occupying 17,000 square feet in the dead center of Manhattan, the
most competitive, demanding food city in the United States, where
the locals think they know a thing or two about quality takeout
food already. In the land of Zabar's, Balducci's and Dean &AMP; DeLuca,
does an upstart like Eatzi's stand a fighting chance?
</P>
<P>
   Even Eatzi's executives admit that they would not have taken on
Manhattan without the Macy's sponsorship, but Eatzi's is not going
empty-handed to the party. Industry analysts credit Eatzi's with
being the one company that seems to have figured out how to make
quality take-home food and sell it at an affordable price.
</P>
<P>
   That puts it in an excellent position to make a killing in the
fast-growing takeout market, now worth about $60 billion, analysts
say, with the potential to double in size over the next seven or
eight years.
</P>
<P>
   But Eatzi's is also the sort of place some New Yorkers love to
hate _ the heavy corporate hand reaching into what had been, often
as not, a charming mom-and-pop industry. Maybe that's why the
cuteness factor at Eatzi's is high. When bread comes out of the
oven, jolly bakers shout, ``Hot bread, fresh out of the oven.''
</P>
<P>
   When roasted chickens emerge from their trial by fire, a team of
chefs welcome them with a chant: ``Wood-fired roasted chicken,
fresh out of the oven. So tender, so juicy, so succulent, and oh,
so golden brown.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the bustle, yielding right of way to platter-bearing chefs,
shoppers do what Eatzi's was designed for them to do: put together
a completely prepared restaurant-quality meal at a price of about
$7.
</P>
<P>
   The pickings go beyond a roast chicken with two vegetables. At
Macy's, 100 chefs and bakers will turn out 1,800 prepared items
every day, from baguettes ($1.99) and individual creme brulees
($2.49) to braised broccoli rape and cannellini beans ($6.99).
</P>
<P>
   The prices are market-driven, said Eatzi's spokeswoman Carol
Cobbler. For example, an 18-ounce meat loaf that costs $6.49 on
Long Island will be $6.99 in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   As they move from station to station (14 in all), customers can
build salads at three price points ($5.49, $5.79, $6.49), put
together their own Oriental noodle soups, take away pasta salads
and entrees, or cruise the refrigerated shelves for box lunches,
sushi meals and frozen foods. Add the chips, sodas, salad
dressings, jams and condiments, and Eatzi's offers 4,500 items.
</P>
<P>
   In its other sites, Eatzi's has flourished because it offers a
solution to a problem: how to put together a reasonably priced,
good-tasting meal without actually cooking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public is looking for some control over where and when
they eat,'' said Philip Romano, a consultant who developed the
Eatzi's concept for Brinker International Inc., the Dallas-based
company that operates casual dining chains like Chili's Grill &AMP;
Bar. ``They like restaurant food, but it's not been available on
their terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast foods offer convenience and price but fall short on
quality. Top-end stores like Dean &AMP; DeLuca and Zabar's have the
quality, but middle-class shoppers would run the risk of
credit-card meltdown assembling a dinner for four. Eatzi's is
taking dead aim at the broad middle, and in a restaurant-mad,
takeout-crazy city like New York, it may have found its richest
target.
</P>
<P>
   ``To go out to eat to avoid cooking at home is overkill,'' said
Eatzi's president F. Lane Cardwell Jr. ``It's an hour-and-a-half
solution to an hour-and-a-half problem. We're trying to give a 15-
or 20-minute solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Eatzi's, as Cardwell is fond of saying, wants to be your
refrigerator. After the first Eatzi's opened in Dallas in January
1996 _ and customers figured out how to use the store, and stopped
calling to make reservations _ it took off. An average of 2,500
people pass through the store each day. Last year, it rang up sales
of about $14 million.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, the learning curve is likely to be flat. ``In New
York, it's easy to understand,'' said Steven Kent, a restaurant
analyst at Goldman, Sachs. ``You can say, `It's almost like
Balducci's or Zabar's.' Here, a gigantic supermarket is a
novelty.''
</P>
<P>
   With a touch of understatement, Romano said, ``Dallas surprised
us.'' Brinker, whose 806 restaurants generated sales of $1.6
billion last year, is not a company that rushes into things, and it
had planned to observe the Dallas experiment for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas forced the company's hand. Four months after Eatzi's
opened, Brinker began looking for new locations. It branched out to
Houston's Galleria, and then to Atlanta before creeping north to
Long Island and Manhattan, looking for neighborhoods that Romano
calls ``slam-dunk locations.'' Next stop, Rockville, Md., in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan was not part of the plan. ``Believe me, it takes
courage to come to Manhattan if you're from Dallas,'' Cardwell
said. ``We would not have come if it were not for Macy's.''
</P>
<P>
   Macy's, in the midst of a $150 million makeover, was looking for
a tenant who would bring new life to Macy's Cellar, created nearly
25 years ago from what had been the store's bargain basement.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Ed Finkelstein opened it, Macy's placed a great emphasis
on the cellar, but as time went by, the food business was becoming
more difficult for us to master,'' said Kathy Kramer, Macy's vice
president for leased operations, referring to Edward Finkelstein,
the store's former chairman. Neal Goldberg, its senior vice
president and general manager, put it more bluntly. ``We didn't
know how to run food well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is a trade-off. Macy's gambles on a start-up operation
with no name recognition in Manhattan. Eatzi's submits to the
discipline of living under someone else's roof in order to gain
access to the 30,000 customers who pass through Macy's every day,
and to the 100,000 pedestrians who traverse 34th Street each day.
</P>
<P>
   To snare the sidewalk traffic, Macy's has set up a bank of video
monitors in a 34th Street window that lets passers-by see the
Eatzi's chefs and bakers at work one floor below the street.
</P>
<P>
   Eatzi's will also get its own entrance on 34th Street in the
middle of the block, so it will be able to serve breakfast foods
starting at 7 a.m. and to stay open until 10 p.m. But it has had to
deviate from its formula by installing tables and seats for 170
diners. Tables and chairs say ``restaurant''; Eatzi's desperately
wants to avoid that association, just as it makes a point not to
have shopping carts, which say ``grocery store.''
</P>
<P>
   To put some more New York into it, Eatzi's revised its offerings
after sending its food team to the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a complete eat-fest, shopping the markets, eating at
top restaurants,'' said Michael Spinelli, Eatzi's executive chef at
Macy's, who formerly worked as an executive sous-chef at the
Marriott Marquis in midtown. He and John D'Amelio, Eatzi's
corporate executive chef, added a lot of Italian food, like
braciola, polenta and a revised meatball recipe borrowed from
D'Amelio's grandmother. To compete with New York's soup business,
Eatzi's created Italian lentil soup, and a soup that incorporates
roasted poblano peppers and New York state cheddar.
</P>
<P>
   With an eye to New York's Asian restaurants, the chefs came up
with a noodle-bowl station. They added pastrami and corned beef to
the sandwich board, and also fancy offerings like roasted pork with
onion, garlic, Boursin cheese and arugula on ciabatta bread.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that New Yorkers will look at Eatzi's and say,
``Been there, done that,'' that they will hear the singing chefs,
roll their eyes, and say, ``PLEASE.'' Brinker executives are
betting that the neighborhood office workers, the human tidal wave
that moves to and from Pennsylvania Station and the captive
audience of Macy's shoppers will see Eatzi's as the answer to their
prayers.
</P>
<P>
   They're also betting that New Yorkers, familiar with Grace's
Marketplace, Citarella and Balducci's, will get the concept faster
than any other market.
</P>
<P>
   That's the gamble. Both sides, pressed up against the gaming
table, are looking anxiously to see how the dice tumble.

N.Y. FOOD NOTES: BABY KIWIS; MANSION FOR CATERING; WILLIAMS-SONOMA

   They Look Like Olives and Taste Like Big Kiwis
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They're called baby kiwis because inside, these
inch-long specimens look and taste exactly like regular kiwis. But
they have no fuzz. ``We like to say we have a contract with
Remington,'' said Mark Hurst, the owner of Hurst's Berry Farm in
Sheridan, Ore., a grower of baby kiwis, which are available
nationally through the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their name, baby kiwis are actually mature fruit, a
variety developed in Russia at least 50 years ago. (All kiwis
originated in China. They were introduced as Chinese gooseberries
in New Zealand in 1906. After New Zealand developed an
international market for the fruit in the 1950s, the name was
changed to kiwi.)
</P>
<P>
   The babies have thin, smooth, gray-green skins, sometimes with a
bit of blush, and they look something like olives. When ripe, they
yield slightly, like a nectarine. The best part is they can be
eaten skin and all, making them convenient for salads or for
children's lunch boxes. Each baby kiwi has four or five calories.
Like regular kiwis, they are rich in vitamin C.
</P>
<P>
   Many Food Emporium and Waldbaum's supermarkets sell them for
$2.50 for a six-ounce basket, about 30 kiwis. They are also
available at Agata &AMP; Valentina, 1505 First Ave. (79th Street), for
$2.98 a basket.
</P>
<P>
   Off to Dobbs Ferry
</P>
<P>
   On the bus taking party guests from Manhattan to Westchester
County, servers pop the corks on bottles of champagne and pass hors
d'oeuvres. It's just the beginning for a catered event at
Estherwood, a turn-of-the-century mansion in Dobbs Ferry that is
available to rent.
</P>
<P>
   The house was built by James Jennings McComb and his wife,
Esther Wood McComb, in 1895. It is now on the grounds of the
Masters School, which once used it as a dormitory. For 16 years,
Jensina Olson catered parties at Estherwood, doing the cooking
herself. Two years ago, she teamed up with Remy Gautier, the chef
who owns Cuisine de France, a Manhattan catering company, to
provide the food for parties.
</P>
<P>
   The house can accommodate up to 225 people for a cocktail
reception, and buses from Manhattan can be arranged. Costs for
catered events vary, depending on the menu. In addition, the school
charges $250 an hour for the use of the house on weekdays and
$1,400 plus $10 a person on weekends. Information: (914) 693-3322.
</P>
<P>
   From Williams-Sonoma
</P>
<P>
   Williams-Sonoma has introduced a catalog devoted entirely to
foods _ both shelf-stable goods like condiments and perishables
like lamb chops and croissants.
</P>
<P>
   The catalog may come in handy for people who do not have ready
access to retail shops that sell fresh rabbit or imported
prosciutto, but they will pay high prices for the convenience. And
they cannot expect last-minute service. Perishable items like meats
and seafood have to be ordered more than a week in advance, with
very little flexibility in the delivery date. The fastest delivery
for nonperishable foods is two days, with a $10 surcharge.
</P>
<P>
   A look through the catalog shows that the collection has been
gathered from generally high-quality domestic and imported sources.
The catalog gives precise information about shelf life, storage and
serving.
</P>
<P>
   The food catalog (800-699-2297) will be published twice a year;
the company's regular catalog will continue to carry some food
items as well.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Of the eight Greek dessert choices on the menu at the
highly regarded midtown Manhattan restaurant Molyvos, the one
ordered least is mastic ice cream with Commandaria and fig sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Mastic ice cream?
</P>
<P>
   True, the dessert suffers from a name-image problem: it's not
exactly loaded with lyricism.
</P>
<P>
   It is unfamiliar, too, except to those who know this rare and
costly flavoring; at $60 to more than $100 a pound, mastic might be
called the caviar of flavors. Strictly speaking neither a spice nor
an herb, mastic is the resin of the mastic tree, or the pistacia
lentiscus bush, an evergreen related to the pistachio plant, for
which the Greek island of Chios is known.
</P>
<P>
   At Molyvos, the bold souls who take a chance on the unknown meet
authentic mastic and are invariably rewarded. It makes a creamy and
very rich ice cream with a haunting, slightly sweet flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The subtle taste of mastic is hard to pinpoint exactly. Jim
Botsacos, the chef at the restaurant, describes it as a combination
of fennel, anise and mint. To me, it's the taste equivalent of the
smell of a pine forest.
</P>
<P>
   Mastic, an ancient Greek ingredient, was introduced to Molyvos
by Aglaia Kremezi, a food writer in Athens who acts as a consultant
to the restaurant. By e-mail from Athens, she confirmed that in the
realm of flavorings, it's probably safe to say there is no
substitute.
</P>
<P>
   It is an ingredient well known to home cooks in Greece and some
Middle Eastern countries, but I have never seen it mentioned by
name on a restaurant menu. Ms. Kremezi suggested using it at
Molyvos in part because it is so little known here.
</P>
<P>
   It is sometimes inaccurately called gum arabic, ``but mastic
should never be confused with that tasteless substance,'' Ms.
Kremezi emphasized.
</P>
<P>
   Known from antiquity and thought to have healing properties,
mastic straight from the tree was the first chewing gum and today
it is still used as a kind of natural Chiclet. You can try it as
chewing gum by putting a little mastic crystal in your mouth and
chewing; if you try hard enough, you can even blow bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   Mastic is sold as crystals, and a handful of them look like tiny
bits of golden rock candy or coarse colored sea salt. But to use it
as a flavoring, the mastic crystals are ground into a powder (easy
to do in a home spice grinder) and then added in small amounts to
pastries, puddings, cookies, ice cream and breads, both savory and
sweet.
</P>
<P>
   In Egypt and elsewhere in the Middle East, mastic is sometimes
used in chicken dishes, combined with spices like cardamom and
cinnamon. It blends nicely, but in a spice mix, subtle mastic tends
to get lost.
</P>
<P>
   In a Greek sweet like loukoumades though, mastic can make a big
flavor statement. These puffy deep-fried flour and yeast fritters,
once commonplace as street food, are fast disappearing from Greece,
Ms. Kremezi said. The mastic gives the light little fritters an
unexpected complexity.
</P>
<P>
   As a bonus at Molyvos, the sauce served with the mastic ice
cream introduces another relatively unfamiliar ingredient,
Commandaria, a fortified dessert wine from Cyprus. Made from a
blend of red and white grapes, this is an ancient wine _ some
historians contend it is the world's oldest in continuous
production.
</P>
<P>
   Commandaria is a dark wine with a rich sweetness, similar to
some ports. It is great with biscotti and especially good with figs
and chocolate. For the sauce, Botsacos reduces Commandaria with a
bit of sugar and some cinnamon sticks, and then mixes in dried
figs.
</P>
<P>
   (In the summer, he varies the sauce by using a muscat wine from
the island of Samos, reducing it with a bit of sugar, thickening it
with a little cornstarch and then letting fresh summer fruits
macerate in the sauce for an hour or two before serving it with the
ice cream.)
</P>
<P>
   More elegant than syrupy, Commandaria is readily available in
this country and a great buy, too. The Commandaria St. John I buy
at a local wine shop costs $9 for a 750-milliliter bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Mastic crystals are sold at Greek and many Middle Eastern shops,
including Sahadi Importing Co., 187 Atlantic Ave., Brooklyn
Heights, 718-624-4550 ($3.75 an ounce), and Kalustyan, 123
Lexington Ave., at 28th Street, 212-685-3451 ($6.50 an ounce; mail
orders accepted).
</P>
<P>
   The price is not as prohibitive as it may seem; a little bit of
mastic goes a long way. My $5 bag from Sahadi (about an ounce and a
half) has taken me through the following recipes, and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I'm using a half teaspoon or so of mastic as a flavoring in
standard bread and cookie recipes, all of which, so far, have been
masticated happily by all comers.

<P>
   2 cups heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   15 egg yolks.
</P>
<P>
   1. Put the mastic and } tablespoon sugar in a coffee-bean
grinder, and pulverize into a powder.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a large heavy saucepan over medium heat, bring milk, heavy
cream and \ cup of sugar to a boil. While the mixture is heating,
combine remaining \ cup sugar with the egg yolks in a bowl. With a
wire whisk, beat until mixture is pale yellow.

<P>
   3. Temper the yolks by gently pouring 1 cup of the hot cream
mixture into the yolk mixture, whisking constantly until well
mixed. Return the remaining cream mixture to the stove over low
heat. Stir in the yolk mixture. With a wooden spoon, stir slowly
over very low heat until the mixture thickens, about 6 minutes. Do
not let it boil. To test, run your finger across the back of the
spoon after dipping it into the cream. If it is sufficiently
cooked, the line will hold.
</P>
<P>
   4. Strain the hot mixture through a fine mesh sieve into a

   LOUKOUMADES (BATTER FRITTERS WITH HONEY SAUCE)
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from ``Foods of Greece'' by Aglaia Kremezi (Stewart,
Tabori &AMP; Chang, 1993)
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes, plus 2 hours' rising time
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon active dry yeast
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon mastic crystals
</P>
<P>
   2 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/3 teaspoon fine sea salt
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons ouzo
</P>
<P>
   { cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 cup honey, preferably thyme-scented
</P>
<P>
   Olive oil or sunflower oil, or a combination, for frying
</P>
<P>
   Ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   Toasted sesame seeds
</P>
<P>
   Grated nutmeg.
</P>
<P>
   1. Dissolve yeast in { cup warm water. Let sit for 10 minutes.
Grind the mastic crystals to a powder in a coffee-bean grinder.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a large bowl, mix the ground mastic, flour, salt, ouzo and
{ cup warm water. Stir well with a wooden spoon to make a thick but
pourable batter. Cover loosely, put in a warm place and let stand
until doubled in size, about 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   3. In a heavy saucepan, mix the sugar, { cup water and the
honey. Bring to a boil, lower heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Set
aside.
</P>
<P>
   4. Heat 4 inches of oil in a deep, heavy skillet or deep fryer
to 375 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   5. Take a handful of batter in one hand and make a fist; in your
other hand, hold a wet spoon. Squeeze your fist so that a 1{-inch
spherical piece of dough emerges from the top of your fist, like
toothpaste coming out of its tube. Collect the piece of dough on
the wet spoon, then drop dough into oil. Dip the spoon in a glass
of water, then proceed in the same way until all the batter is
used. The fritters will puff up and rise to the surface. When they
are golden brown, remove them with a slotted spoon and drain on
paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   6. Transfer fritters to a serving plate while still hot. Pour
honey sauce over them, and sprinkle with cinnamon, sesame seeds and
a little nutmeg. Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 20 to 25 fritters.

FISH WITH A CRISP CRUST, AND NO FRYING OR BREADING 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: recipe at end of article)  
 (bl)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've sat at lunch with friends and heard them wonder when
presented with a nicely crisped piece of fish, ``How do they get
such a fabulous crust on there?'' The fish isn't fried, nor is it
breaded: it's just perfectly browned.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The detectives among them notice that the fish is perfectly
browned on one side only, and that's the key. In fact, it is cooked
on one side only _ or nearly so.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most fish is so moist that it is difficult to brown it. The
surface of the flesh must dry out before it browns, and since fish
cooks so quickly, the interior is usually done long before this
happens.
</P>
<P>
   That's why fish is often coated before cooking; the coating
browns much more rapidly than the fish itself.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If, however, you brown only one side of the fillet, that side
develops a crisp crust, and the center remains moist.
</P>
<P>
   In restaurants, where this technique is common, the cooking is
completed by flipping the fish for the last minute or so of
cooking, which is sufficient (it is then presented crisp side up,
and few people ever notice that the downward facing side is
completely pale).
</P>
<P>
   This technique will work at home, too, but the results are not
only nicely cooked fish, but also a messy stove top and a lingering
aroma. Restaurants solve these problems with powerful exhaust fans
and a crew of night cleaners.
</P>
<P>
   Most home cooks need a different solution, and this is it: heat
your oven to the absolute maximum before beginning to cook (even
600 degrees is not too hot).
</P>
<P>
   Start the fish on top of the stove to heat the pan a bit, then
immediately move it to the oven (if you have a baking stone, place
the pan on it; if not, place the pan on any oven rack). In just a
few minutes, the fish will brown beautifully on the bottom and
remain moist within (as long, of course, as it isn't overcooked).
And you won't have to flip the fish.
</P>
<P>
   This technique works equally well with fish that has its skin
and that has had its skin removed.
</P>
<P>
   If the skin is on, it becomes irresistibly crisp and delicious
(especially when sprinkled with a little coarse salt). If it is
off, the flesh becomes crisp and almost tough, a nice contrast to
the remaining part of the fish, which remains moist and tender.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A too-thin piece of fish will overcook in the time it takes to
brown one side. You cannot follow this technique with, for example,
a fillet of flounder or even a thin piece of cod. It is best
performed with fillets of a near-uniform thickness of about one
inch: thicker pieces of cod, for example, or center cuts of striped
bass or salmon, or a thick piece of sea bass.

<P>
   STRIPED BASS COOKED ON ONE SIDE, WITH MUSHROOMS
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons minced shallots
</P>
<P>
   1 pound mushrooms, preferably a mixture like shiitake, crimini
and button, trimmed, rinsed and sliced
</P>
<P>
   1{ to 2 pounds of 1-inch thick fillet of striped bass or other
fish in 1 or 2 pieces, preferably with skin on
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Minced parsley for garnish.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven it to its maximum, at least 500 degrees. Place 2
tablespoons of oil in a large skillet, and turn heat to medium. Add
shallots, and cook, stirring, until they soften, about 3 minutes.
Add mushrooms, and raise heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring
occasionally, until mushrooms give up their liquid and become
tender, about 10 minutes. Season to taste and keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   2. On the stove top, heat an ovenproof skillet over high heat.
Add remaining oil; when it smokes, add fish, skin side down. Season
fish with salt and pepper, and transfer to oven (place it on a
baking stone, if you have one); set a timer for 6 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   3. Stir vinegar into the mushrooms; taste, and adjust seasoning.
Check fish when timer goes off; it is done when the interior is
opaque and a thin-bladed knife passes through it with little
resistance. Serve fish, skin (or crisp) side up, on a bed of the
mushrooms. Drizzle with the fish pan juices, and garnish with the
parsley.

   MIDEAST-PEACE _ JERUSALEM _ At best, the summit between Israeli
and Palestinian leaders starting tomorrow in Maryland, will just be
one step on the long road toward bringing hope to disheartened
Israelis and Palestinians. But, it would be a necessary step before
bigger issues than the land in question can be resolved and a
crisis brewing for next May can be avoided. If the requisite
trappings of summits do materialize _ agreements signed, handshakes
photographed you can expect right wing Israelis to try to topple
the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and hard-line
Palestinians to try to block progress with terrorist actions.
Having been burned so many times when hoped seemed just around the
corner, people on both sides won't believe peace progress until
they see it. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

   US-KOSOVO _ WASHINGTON _ (DEVELOPING) An 11th-hour deal the
United States brokered with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
to avert near-term NATO air strikes and stop the bloodshed in
Kosovo has also put the Serbian province on track for talks leading
to autonomy. The breakthrough, announced Monday night by President
Clinton, came after NATO authorized airstrikes if Milosevic didn't
match his promises with action. Clinton said NATO had agreed to
hold off on airstrikes for four days so international inspectors
could verify that Milosevic has met U.N. Security Council demands
to stop the violence. But U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke said, ``We
hope this will mark a turning point in the right direction. But the
proof ... is in compliance with U.N. resolution 1199 and with
actions on the ground in Kosovo.'' (Deans, Cox News Service).

</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-POLITICS _ ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ How is the
Clinton-Lewinsky scandal playing in the fall races? In Rep. Bob
Etheridge's district, his Republican opponent ran ads accusing him
of having ``Clinton values,'' but recently has been focusing on
more traditional issues. That seems to reflect a national trend in
whcih both parties are content to let the scandal simmer in the
background. (Shepard, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-VICTORY _ WASHINGTON _ Some analysts argue that any
Republican gain is a mandate for impeachment, while others say that
if House Democrats do better than lose 29 seats _ the average this
century for an incumbent party's sixth year in the White House _
censure negotiations are likely. What result would be seen as a
victory for President Clinton? (Shepard, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-JONES _ WASHINGTON _ Come Monday, will scandal
aficionados be using the Internet to examine thousands of pages of
potentially embarrassing transcripts from Paula Jones's sexual
harassment lawsuit against President Clinton? The federal judge in
the Arkansas case plans to start releasing evidence that day in the
case, which has been dismissed but is under appeal. Many observers
bet that a settlement will be reached by then, because both sides
have strong incentives to do so. (Malone, Cox News Service).

   TECH-GENDER _ WASHINGTON _ A major new gender gap in technology
has developed in American schools, the American Association of
University Women reported today. ``While boys program and
problem-solve with computers, girls use computers for word
processing, the 1990s version of typing,'' said AAUW Executive
Director Janice Weinman. The report said the gap was developing
even as girls close previous gender gaps in math and science
achievement. (Shepard, Cox News Service).

Department may be preparing to settle a discrimination suit filed
by black farmers, a federal judge holds a 1 p.m. EDT status hearing

pursue their claim as a class-action suit, increasing pressure on
the department. (Monroe, Cox News Service).

Rudolph because it was his biggest sale since he went into business
in 1993 - one of the bills was $622. Rudolph used the name Bob
Randolph and paid with checks, although Rudolph has reportedly told

   CHILD-ABUSE-REPORT _ A district judge was so emotionally moved
by the child abuse death of an infant last year that he has spent
months working on a special report that presents in painful detail
all the problems with Texas' child protective services system.
Judge Scott McCown took it upon himself to become a one-member
blue-ribbon taskforce to try to help abused and neglected children
in Texas. His unprecedented report _ to be sent to the Governor and
Legislature today _ shows a system spinning out of control and show
how Texas is at the bottom of the barrel compared to other states
in helping abused and neglected children and finding adoptive
parents. (Gamino, Austin American-Statesman).
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ABUSE-JUDGE _ Scott McCown once was headed for partner in one of
the country's most prestigious law firms. Then, he gave it all up
for public service. He has made his mark in Texas by working as an
assistant AG on the prison reform lawsuit and the mental
retardation institution lawsuit. Then, he became a judge and forced
Texas to adopt a more equitble funding formula for public schools.
But his heart is with the children. His most important issue these
days is child abuse and neglect and he is leaving his trademark
handprint on another major Texas issue. (Gamino, Austin
American-Statesman).

   TAINTED-MEAT _ ATLANTA _ More meat was recalled from a Georgia
meat plant. Meanwhile, some metro Atlanta students were served the
undercooked, possibly salmonella-tainted meat patties on Monday.
School officials say they weren't notified of the recall. (Kim,

<P>
   LONDON _ One is caught in a horrendous Catch-22 situation,'' is
the way Prince Edward, the youngest of Queen Elizabeth's three
sons, once described the overwrought burst of attention that
greeted him here in 1993 when he announced that in a distinctly
unroyal move he was starting his own film production company,
Ardent Productions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we devote all our time to public duties, we are criticized
for being spongers,'' he said, speaking of his family. ``If we go
off and do our own thing, they say we wouldn't be doing any
business at all if we weren't who we were. It's a no-win situation,
so it doesn't matter which side of the fence you jump off.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, the 34-year-old prince (who calls himself
Edward Windsor professionally) has begun to prove himself
financially, if not always critically, with a series of
lighthearted historical programs on royal-related subjects _
subjects that are embedded in his genes and close to his heart. And
although competitors in Britain's television industry complain that
he is shamelessly trading on his connections to advance his career
(in a way, who would blame him?), he has managed to insure
new-found respect for Ardent by crossing the all-important
continental divide and selling a number of his programs to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The first of these, ``Crown and Country,'' which was shown in
part last month and is being rebroadcast in an expanded format on
Public Television in six 30-minute segments over the next five
weeks (the first segment begins at 7 Sunday night, Oct. 18), is a
whistle-stop tour, written and narrated by Windsor, of various
English spots and their relationship to the monarchy. Among other
things, viewers get an insiders' tour of Windsor Castle from the
prince, who more or less grew up in the castle and thus gains
access to places ``not usually attainable by the public,''
according to Public Television press releases. They are taken
through Winchester, England's ancient capital (and, according to
legend, the original home of King Arthur), and told the story of
King Edmund the martyr, in a segment on St. Edmundsbury, where he
lived.
</P>
<P>
   Next month (Nov. 1 at 8 p.m.), the Learning Channel is to
broadcast another Windsor effort, ``Tales From the Tower,'' a
three-hour encapsulation of hundreds of years of history at the
Tower of London that takes in the stories of Guy Fawkes, Richard
III and Rudolf Hess, among countless others. The three-part program
is presented as ``drama documentary,'' Windsor said, meaning that
the narrative is enlivened by the presence of nontalking actors in
period costume who enact some of the scenes, while a narrator
(Samuel West, rather than Windsor himself) describes the action.
</P>
<P>
   Windsor, who studied history at Cambridge, brings an amateur's
enthusiasm to the research involved (research that doesn't always
bear out, unfortunately: the review tape of the first episode of
``Tales From the Tower'' identifies Ann Boleyn, Henry VIII's second
wife, as his third wife). He loved, he says, the chance to travel
around the country as a regular person, delving into the nooks and
crannies of its history.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all these programs, we're trying to find a balance between
presenting the history and making it entertaining,'' Windsor said
recently, interviewed in his handsome office at Ardent, in a
converted stable on the 87-acre estate in Surrey that he is
currently refurbishing as his principal residence (he also gets a
rent-free apartment in Buckingham Palace). ``To me, it's the
stories _ not the camera angles or the technical tricks or trying
to be frightfully with-it in the way it's filmed _ that make it
entertaining. We don't want something that's frightfully dry,
that's like a history lecture.''
</P>
<P>
   Windsor is such a familiar figure in a country obsessed with
royalty that it's impossible to forget, when talking to him, that
he is, in fact, a prince (even if you did forget it, his signet
ring, stamped with a crown over the initial E, would be a dead
giveaway). But as the third son (he is seventh in line for the
throne), he has an eager-to-please ease of manner that would not be
associated with, say, Prince Charles, his eldest brother and the
heir to the throne.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   His work has not been particularly well received in Britain,
where he is sometimes cheekily referred to as ``the Edward formerly
known as prince.'' The Evening Standard, for instance, said that
``Crown and Country'' was ``cheesy and pompous'' and too
reverential toward the monarchy. The Guardian, however, took a more
forgiving view. ``Edward cut a surprisingly telegenic figure:
relaxed, informal, handsome even,'' the paper wrote. ``His
intellectual credentials may have been overstated, but the series
was a success.''
</P>
<P>
   Mean comments about his work, Edward says with an insouciant
shrug, are par for the course. In Britain, he told a group of
television reporters recently, ``If you've got a title, than you
also don't have any brains.'' (The British news media were not
amused by his mini-rant, calling him ``the prince of petulance.'')
In truth, Edward does seem to spend a depressingly large percentage
of his time trying to prove that he is not a chinless royal dolt
playing at having a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``People's perceptions of these things are very strange,'' he
said, describing what it means to compete as a royal in a nonroyal
world. ``It takes a very, very long time to shift people's minds
and how they generate these perceptions. And by continuing to
perpetuate these stereotypes, the news media doesn't help.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued, speaking of Britain: ``There's probably more
baggage here, more age-old perceptions here. It's possible to be
able to get a foot in the door but then you have a much deeper
climb. If one of the stations is going to commission you to do a
program, than Ardent has got to be 10 times better than anyone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   His public relations campaign has not been helped by the fact
that early on, he announced that he didn't plan to produce a ``rush
of royal programs.'' It is a remark that has come to haunt him.
After racking up nearly $2 million in losses in its first three
years, Ardent began moving increasingly toward royal programs,
programs that depend explicitly on the producer's impeccable
connections. These include a documentary on the 1992 fire and
subsequent restoration of Windsor Castle, which used special
footage from the Royal Collection, free of charge, and a film
called ``Edward on Edward,'' in which Windsor examined the strange
and sad life of his uncle, King Edward VII, who abdicated and lived
the rest of his life as the Duke of Windsor.
</P>
<P>
   Windsor rejects the notion that he has become the in-house
filmmaker for the royal family, pointing out that Ardent has made a
number of nonroyal programs, including a drama, ``The Cater Street
Hangman,'' based on a Victorian murder mystery by the novelist Anne
Perry (to be shown on A&AMP;E in December). ``It's more balanced than
it seems,'' he said, ``but the royal programs are the ones that
attract the press and publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he acknowledged, he does bring a singular
perspective to the subject. ``The nation measures its life in terms
of reigns, and the kings and queens provide the thread that runs
through history,'' he said of his ancestors. ``What I want to do is
to no longer see them just as extraordinary people in terms of
history but to see them as real people, often thrown together by a
twist of fate into extraordinary circumstances. Some are very good
at it, some are dreadful, and the majority just get by. At the
heart, they're ordinary people.''

WHITE HOUSE DOG WON'T SING 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are two potential eyewitnesses to HankyPankygate, neither
of whom has testified before the grand jury, given a deposition or
even been offered $3 million to appear on Roseanne's new talk show.
</P>
<P>
   I am speaking, of course, of Socks the cat and Buddy the dog.
</P>
<P>
   Socks and Buddy have, quite wisely, kept a very low profile
throughout this whole unpleasantness, a strategy that may have
diverted the attention of Ken Starr and company to other sources of
information.
</P>
<P>
   If anybody had taken the trouble to ask Socks or Buddy what they
knew or when they knew it, this whole unfortunate matter might well
be behind us by now and we, the American people, could get on with
more important business such as dreading Christmas shopping or
waiting for the ``Lost in Space'' sequel to come out.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, if not likely, that Socks and Buddy were asleep
or busy elsewhere during those many times that Bill and Monica were
alone together in the Oval Office, ordering pizza.
</P>
<P>
   From my experience, dogs are particularly unreliable witnesses
and often have trouble keeping track of what's happening right
under their nose, let alone in some distant, pepperoni-scented
hallway.
</P>
<P>
   My pug dog, Buster, for example, sleeps an average of 21 hours a
day, and it's during those times that his mental faculties are at
their most alert.
</P>
<P>
   It's during those rare moments of consciousness that his brain
leaves his body and is replaced by a stale biscuit or, possibly, a
sunflower seed.
</P>
<P>
   Since I have very little else going on in my life, much of my
fun comes from watching Buster ``chase'' bunnies.
</P>
<P>
   Before you animal rights nuts mail me a pipe bomb, be advised
that no bunnies are harmed in any way during this game, unless,
perhaps, they pull a muscle in their side from laughing so hard.
</P>
<P>
   Buster and I will be out in the yard, doing our business, and I
will see a bunny grazing contentedly on my yard weeds, say, 30 feet
away. Buster, his keen canine senses at full alert, sees nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buster!'' I shout, pointing at the bunny. ``Bunny! Get the
bunny!''
</P>
<P>
   This is Buster's signal to turn in the exact opposite direction
from wherever I'm pointing and charge off at full speed, usually
into a tree or a fence.
</P>
<P>
   The bunnies that eat my yard learned long ago that they are more
in danger from falling asteroids than they are from Buster, and
often invite their friends over to watch the ``chase.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes there will be three or four bunnies in the yard
watching Buster tear around in frantic circles just a few feet from
where they're grazing. You would think by sheer, dumb luck he would
bump into one by accident, but so far that hasn't happened.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I will pick Buster up and throw him in the direction
of the bunnies, in order to better his odds. This has had no
effect, either, other than to cause me some lower-back pain.
</P>
<P>
   But the game is not a total loss. Buster and I both get exercise
and for the bunnies it's like an evening at a comedy club, only
cheaper and without all the annoying cigarette smoke.
</P>
<P>
   All of which I mention simply to make the point that President
Clinton probably has nothing to fear from any testimony Buddy may
give, because if he is anything like Buster, he wouldn't have
noticed Monica's visits if she had steamed in on the Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony of Socks the cat, though ... well, that's an
entirely different matter.

   After years of being tolerated with a mixture of apathy,
cynicism and denial, corruption is becoming a target of serious
international action.
</P>
<P>
   Where once they looked the other way, the World Bank,
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other global organizations
are now seeking to curb bribery and other corrupt practices.

   The convention, signed in 1997 and now undergoing ratification
by the legislatures of 34 nations, will end the competitively
damaging isolation of the United States, which banned bribing
foreign public officials in 1977. Bribery scandals in half a dozen
countries led the United States to pass the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act in hopes that other countries would follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   But the act was derided as misguided American moralism, and
foreign competitors remained free to use bribes to win commercial
orders. Many countries, including Germany and France, even allowed
their deduction as business expenses. The United States also
promoted a U.N. treaty to ban bribery, but that effort fizzled. The
developing world saw the proposed treaty merely as an opportunity
to bash multinational companies.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom saw corruption as a chronic characteristic
of human behavior that, in any event, was not of debilitating
proportions in the developed world.
</P>
<P>
   Although admittedly widespread in the Third World, endemic
corruption was not seen as impeding rapid growth in countries such
as Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand. Some economists
even saw bribery as grease for the wheels of progress in
overregulated societies.
</P>
<P>
   During the last six years, however, there has been a dramatic
change in the tolerance of corruption. A wave of bribery scandals
hit all parts of the world. In Asia, the downfall of Indonesian
President Suharto followed swelling protests against his refusal to
undertake reforms, especially regarding his family's ill-gotten
billions from state-connected enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption charges played a critical role in the defeat of Prime
Ministers P.V. Narasimha Rao of India and Benazir Bhutto of
Pakistan. In South Korea, former Presidents Roh Tae Woo and Chun
Doo Hwan were jailed following disclosures that they had received
enormous bribes from Korean companies.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, numerous top-level government and business leaders
have resigned in the wake of corruption scandals. In Latin America,
bribery charges resulted in the impeachments of Presidents Fernando
Collor de Mello of Brazil and Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela, as
well as the resignation of President Abdala Bucaram of Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari was tarnished by
his brother's illicit accumulation of huge sums. President Ernesto
Samper of Colombia avoided impeachment over his acceptance of money
from the Cali drug cartel, but his political authority was eroded
and his party lost the recent presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, the bribery charges brought by Milanese magistrates
have overthrown the entire leadership that ruled Italy for more
than four decades. The defeat of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of
Spain was partly due to bribery scandals involving members of his
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Bribery charges also caused the resignation of NATO
Secretary-General Willy Claes, a former Belgian defense minister,
and of Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's overthrow of Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko was
fueled by popular resentment of his multibillion-dollar corruption.
In China, a member of the Politburo resigned in a massive
corruption scandal. The foregoing, while far from complete,
demonstrates a worldwide phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   The growing intolerance of corruption stems from the convergence
of several political and economic pressures. The post-Cold War era
has brought an opening up of governmental processes, freer news
coverage and increased independence of prosecutors and judges.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption is harder to hide, as the wave of bribery scandals
involving high-level officials in Europe, Asia and South America
demonstrates. On the economic front, impediments to investment and
other dysfunctions due to corruption are vividly displayed in
Russia, Africa and Eastern Europe. With the growth of the global
economy, international business leaders are increasingly
recognizing that common, morally defensible rules are essential.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, people have recognized that corruption is a
major obstacle to democratic transitions, market economies and
development. Citizens are using protests, elections and agencies of
civil society to press for reform.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the World Bank and other international financing
agencies paid little heed to corruption, apparently considering it
a political matter outside their purview. At the bank, this
attitude began to change with the appointment of James Wolfensohn
as president in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   His speech at that year's annual meeting included the first
reference to corruption in a presidential address. At the 1996
meeting, Wolfensohn made combating bribery a top priority. He
invited Transparency International _ an anticorruption organization
that in five years has established chapters in more than 70
countries and publishes an annual index rating corruption country
by country _ to help develop the bank's anticorruption strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the bank adopted a comprehensive program, including
strong controls to prevent bribery on World Bank-financed projects
and assistance to governments to promote reforms. Similar changes
are taking place at other international financing agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF, going beyond its traditional focus on monetary and
fiscal policy, is emphasizing the need for transparency and other
steps to curb corruption. The Inter-American, European and Asian
Development Banks are following the World Bank's lead in adopting
stricter controls over projects they finance. And the Global
Coalition for Africa has made combating corruption its most
important priority for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Inter-American Convention Against Corruption was adopted in
March 1996. It has been signed by 26 countries, but ratified by
only 10. Momentum behind this convention lessened as efforts to
create a hemispheric free-trade area stalled. Congressional renewal
of the fast-track authority needed by the executive branch to
negotiate trade treaties could reignite interest.
</P>
<P>
   Establishment by the Organization of American States of a body
similar to the OECD's Anti-Bribery Working Group to provide
professional support and monitor progress by Western hemisphere
governments would also be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   The International Chamber of Commerce in Paris is playing an
important role in encouraging the global business community to
become active in fighting corruption. The chamber's focus is on
improving corporate self-regulation programs.
</P>
<P>
   Strong ``Rules of Conduct to Combat Extortion and Bribery,''
prepared by a group of lawyers, managers, and scholars from over a
dozen countries, were issued in 1996. The rules deal forthrightly
with such issues as payments to sales agents and other
intermediaries, business entertainment and gifts, and political
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   They cover not only bribery of public officials but bribery
within the private sector as well. The chamber is preparing a
manual to assist companies in complying with the rules and with the
OECD principles.
</P>
<P>
   This, along with greater use of corporate rules of conduct, will
reduce the supply side of international corruption. The demand side
_ extortion and other forms of corruption by public officials _ is
more difficult to target effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Every country has laws prohibiting its officials from taking
bribes, but such laws are unlikely to be enforced when top
officials are corrupt. The World Bank, IMF, Transparency
International and others are working on programs to promote greater
transparency in government operations and other measures to combat
demand-side abuses.
</P>
<P>
   By curbing foreign bribery, industrialized countries will
increase the credibility in the developing world of their proposals
for combating demand-side corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The developments of the last five years, although remarkable,
are only the start of a long, diffcult effort. Although there is
widespread support for action against corruption, entrenched groups
oppose reforms. Corruption has powerful beneficiaries: officials in
high places, companies with large resources and a legion of
influential middlemen.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever corruption has become a way of life, wholesale change
is necessary. Tossing out a few rotten apples will not be enough.
During the last five years, the argument that the costs of
corruption are intolerable has been winning. The biggest challenge
for the next five years is to assure continued public support by
showing tangible results.
</P>
<P>
   Many factors contribute to the pressure for accountability in
the post-Cold War world: the spread of investigative journalism,
opposition parties anxious to expose corrupt ruling parties, more
independent prosecutors and judges, whistle-blower protection, the
growth of the corporate governance movement and the expansion of
the global economy with increased demand for international
accounting standards.
</P>
<P>
   These developments bolster the movement to curb corruption and
enhance the prospects for achieving lasting reforms.

   After years of being tolerated with a mixture of apathy,
cynicism and denial, corruption is becoming a target of serious
international action.
</P>
<P>
   Where once they looked the other way, the World Bank,
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other global organizations
are now seeking to curb bribery and other corrupt practices.
</P>
<P>
   These expanding efforts add up to a reform movement whose most
significant achievement to date is the Convention on Combating
Bribery of Foreign Public Officials of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
</P>
<P>
   The convention, signed in 1997 and now undergoing ratification

THE NEXT INCARNATION OF A GOOD COAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Tuesday Oct. 20)  
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The two wool coats have been my good friends. Though slightly
worn, they are still serviceable, the linings intact, the pockets
not poked through and free of old movie stubs and gum wrappers.
</P>
<P>
   Both coats have been around a while and were not of the highest
quality to begin with. But they've still got some life in them and
would suit someone just fine for a California winter.
</P>
<P>
   The right person could give the coats her own personal signature
and they, in turn, provide warmth and a lift. One is wine red and
short, with impressive shoulders, the other a long charcoal tweed,
two opposites on the fashion spectrum, two different personalities.
</P>
<P>
   The first night I wore the red coat I was exactly where I wanted
to be, out on the town with my husband and friends in an European
city, walking fast on cold icy streets and hurrying into warm loud
taverns.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is red and has outstanding shoulders, you can see it
in the fog and it looks pretty with a dusting of snow on it.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that it came from a German department store, was marked
as a European size 40 instead of an American size 12 and was bought
with marks and not dollars impressed me, as if its foreign origins
gave it, and therefore me, bonus panache.
</P>
<P>
   Had it been hanging on a rack at an American mall I might have
walked right past it. I think my intent that day was to buy
something warm and neutral which otherwise would have translated to
brown or black but this coat forced itself on me. It looked like
something from the 1940s and demanded to be worn with lipstick just
as red. It had swagger, that coat.
</P>
<P>
   It went everywhere I did for a while and then started to turn. I
put it on one day a winter ago and one of my resident fashion
critics frowned and said the coat was losing its dazzle. The color
was slightly faded and it looked tired. Not wanting to appear the
same, I hung it back in the closet.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I gave it up grudgingly. It would have been nice to keep
it around just for the memories but it needs to be worn by someone
who this winter requires a red wool coat.
</P>
<P>
   The tweed was bought on a whim and a lunch break and it worked
for many years. I took it to New York on a winter vacation with my
daughter and it looked as stylish shopping on Fifth Avenue as it
did ice skating in Central Park. Of course, I froze in it since it
was absolutely insufficient for a New York winter, being a
California coat made of light wool and a thin lining and worthless
any place where the temperature gets below freezing and stays
there.
</P>
<P>
   But it made me feel long and tall and urban. It hung straight
and ended at mid-calf. For most of its years I wore it open, loose
and casual as if I had just grabbed it running out the door. The
truth is that I couldn't button it without it bunching in bad
places, which would have given it a definite frump factor which
this coat does not deserve.
</P>
<P>
   But, like the red one, it has miles to go before it sleeps.
Besides, you can't throw a coat away just because its time with one
person is over.
</P>
<P>
   You can turn a T-shirt into a cleaning cloth, hoard the jeans
until stovepipe legs come back and toss the baggy pantyhose without
any guilt at all. But a coat has many lives.
</P>
<P>
   If they were Beanie Babies I could give them names and adopt
them out. But they're just coats that need to move on.
</P>
<P>
   I learned coat recycling long before we did it with bottles and
cans. My mother gave all coats to the church for its rummage sale
and then worked the rummage sale so she could put the lowest price
on them for the neediest candidate. I pass mine on to Goodwill or
Salvation Army.
</P>
<P>
   The Goodwill truck was open that day and the attendant said,
``You sure you want to give these up? You could be needing them in
another month.''
</P>
<P>
   No, I said, explaining I was buying a new coat and I'd feel
better about it if someone else gets these. Then I worried that I
sounded kind of spoiled or like I was looking for a blessing for my
incredible generosity. I drove off, hoping he could tell by my car
I was one of the common folk and not some Lady Bountiful off to
Neiman Marcus to invest in this year's fur.
</P>
<P>
   Someone is going to love these coats and they will be loved
back. Soon they'll be in another closet, wearing someone else's
perfume, taking on a new personality, making someone smile at
herself as she catches her reflection walking down the street.
</P>
<P>
   And I and my balanced karma will be in our new gray silk trench
coat with a detachable fleece lining. Gray is in this year, I hear,
and this fabric is treated with something that allows you to wad it
up in a ball and shake out to full elegance.
</P>
<P>
   I imagine arriving by train into a foreign port. I uncoil from
its gray silkiness, fluff out my hair, put on my dark glasses and
emerge from the compartment looking cool and confident, though
vaguely mysterious. It is my next life and my coat's first.

COMPAQ ADDING FEATURES TO ALTAVISTA WEB SITE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Compaq Computer Corp. and its Alta Vista Web site, the
search is the thing.
</P>
<P>
   While other Internet search engines have chosen to downplay
their services' search functions, Compaq has decided to beef up the
capabilities of AltaVista, the popular site acquired in the $9
billion purchase of Digital Equipment Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intention is to make AltaVista synonymous with search on
the Internet,'' said Rod Schrock, senior vice president of Compaq's
consumer division. ``Searching is the No. 1 thing people do on the
Internet. While every other company is deinvesting in this arena,
we believe there are substantial customer needs yet to be met.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Compaq has added a slew of new features to
AltaVista, including the ability to handle plain-English questions
and filter objectionable content out of searches.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy is distinctly different from that of competing
search sites such as Excite, Lycos and HotBot, which are relying on
glitzy content and topic-based directories to attract visitors,
rather than purely on search.
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista, located at www.altavis-ta.com, was something of a
poor stepchild under its previous owner, Digital. It began as a
research project and was nearly spun off as a separate company.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq placed AltaVista under its consumer division and spruced
up the site. A deal with ABC News provides journalistic content,
while a partnership with a company called LookSmart gives AltaVista
a Yahoo-style site directory.
</P>
<P>
   The features include:
</P>
<P>
   Ask AltaVista, which lets users ask simple English questions,
such as ``Where can I buy a car online?'' or ``How do I care for a
puppy?'' Schrock said the feature relies on a database of 7 million
commonly asked questions that were gathered by a team of
researchers. It was developed in conjunction with a company called
Ask Jeeves, which has its own site at www.aj.com.
</P>
<P>
   AV Family Filter prevents potentially offensive sites from
popping up on a search. Louis Monier, technical director at
AltaVista, said the filter can distinguish between medical
information and ``actual smut,'' so that a search on the word
``breast'' won't prevent a user from learning about breast cancer.
This feature was created in conjunction with SurfWatch, which makes
filtering software for PCs.

<P>
   AV Photo Finder, developed in partnership with Virage, lets
users search a database of 10 million images scattered across the
Web. A search returns a thumbnail picture of the image, which can
be enlarged with a click.
</P>
<P>
   AV Full View Searching combines different types of searching _ a
raw search of AltaVista's 140-million-page Web index, directory
searching a la Yahoo and plain-English questions _ into a single
process.
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista will now spell check a query, recommending correct
spellings of words. For example, if a user misspells ``bottle'' as
``botle,'' the results page includes the words, ``Did you mean
bottle?''
</P>
<P>
   AV On Target is new technology that results in placing more
relevant sites near the top of the results list. Schrock called
this feature the ``secret sauce'' of AltaVista, saying it makes
searches more useful than those of other search engines.
</P>
<P>
   AV Recommends will highlight specific sites that the AltaVista
software believes will most satisfy a user's search for
information.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Parr, director of electronic commerce research at
Framingham, Mass.-based International Data Corp., said AltaVista
already enjoyed a reputation as one of the best search engines on
the Web, and these new features will enhance that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Search is very much a commodity, and despite the fact that
AltaVista is the best, most consumers don't necessarily know the
difference,'' Parr said. ``Ultimately, the question is whether
there is room in the marketplace for a site that is strictly a
search engine.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, search sites have been bidding to become the
start-up page for users' Web browsers as portals to the rest of the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the heap is Yahoo (www.yahoo.com), which is built
around a catalog of Web sites that is maintained by humans.
</P>
<P>
   Other search engines, such as AltaVista, use automation to comb
the Web for new sites to add to a database. When users search for a
site, the database is examined and relevant sites presented in a
page or pages of results.
</P>
<P>
   Those result pages often can return thousands and even millions
of target sites, or hits, per search. The improvements at AltaVista
are an attempt to help sort through that glut of information.
</P>
<P>
   Parr said AltaVista was ``one of the two most-missed
opportunities on the Internet, with the first being the Netscape
home page.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, Netscape Communications did little with its home
page, the default start-up page found on its Navigator Web browser.
Netscape recently has begun beefing up the content there, turning
it into an Internet portal and selling advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq is beginning to realize the promise of AltaVista, Parr
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly a marketing problem, and that's a problem Compaq
knows how to solve,'' he said. &QL;

 Managerial exercise strikes right chord for health sciences
faculty  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Mozart met management Monday morning on the
Folly Theater stage.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six members of the Kansas City Symphony bowed and blew
their way through sections of a Mozart symphony, sitting among
about 100 faculty and department heads of the University of Health
Sciences College of Osteopathic Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The musicians played.
</P>
<P>
   The managers listened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Music Paradigm'' unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   Conductor Roger Nierenberg used his baton and commentary to
weave leadership lessons into a $15,000 management seminar that
Karen Pletz, University of Health Sciences president, hopes will
pay long-term dividends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my goodness. This was money well spent,'' Pletz raved after
the two-hour seminar. ``The musicians illustrated management
principles you hear about and read about all the time, but I'll
never forget the way they were illustrated here.''
</P>
<P>
   In two weeks, university managers will go on a planning retreat.
That, Pletz said, will be a good time to see in action the
principles demonstrated Monday _ teamwork, communication and
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Pletz said she learned from her own turn at sharing
Nierenberg's baton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw all the potential out there and had an overwhelming
sense of responsibility, knowing that all those people were relying
on you to help them develop their potential,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nierenberg, a New York-based musician, developed ``The Music
Paradigm'' as a ``real-time teaching tool that has no lag between
behavior and the results produced from that behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   He contracts with orchestra members around the country to help
him emphasize good management principles. He has worked with
representatives of such companies as Bristol-Myers Squibb; Lever
Brothers; Lockheed Martin; and Sears, Roebuck and Co.
</P>
<P>
   Cora Ray, the university's director of communications, saw a
piece on CNN about Nierenberg and urged Pletz to hire him for a
management training exercise.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during his Folly Theater appearance, Nierenberg led
a lackluster playing of the second movement. Technically it was
proficient, but even untrained ears could hear there were no
dynamics and no emotion in the playing. The musicians complained
when asked for their response.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, a leader can command and control,'' Nierenberg said.
``But I reduced the artists to functionaries, to typists. Through
my desire to be good at my job, to lead, I controlled...but they
didn't like it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's micromanagement!'' laughed Geoffrey Decker, corporate
recruiter for DST Systems, one of the Business Symphony Partner
companies invited to send participants to the training event.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, Nierenberg encouraged the musicians to play as
masterfully as each could. Some virtuoso individual work resulted,
but musicians and managers alike agreed the sum was flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the magic was gone because everyone was trying to
dominate,'' observed Kristi Olsen, training and staff development
specialist for the university.
</P>
<P>
   Nierenberg used the moment to illustrate ``hard skills'' _
technical mastery of the specific job _ and ``soft skills'' _ which
include the ability to work together.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the conductor said, ``We see everything from the
chairs in which we sit. That's our perspective, our reality. We
don't always see the big picture....But when asked to play to make
the orchestra sound absolutely great _ rather than the individual _
the results change.''
</P>
<P>
   To teach other big-picture lessons, Nierenberg plucked members
of the faculty from the stage chairs to join him at the podium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell us what you saw,'' Nierenberg coached William Morris,
assistant professor of osteopathic principles and practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see everyone,'' Morris responded. ``And they can see
me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How does that make you feel?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anxious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those sitting in the chairs have no idea of the anxiety felt
by their leaders,'' Nierenberg summarized. ``They just feel the
effects of their leaders' actions...
</P>
<P>
   ``When you stand at the podium, you see a different reality. We
all need to supersede those boxes we're in and try to see the
bigger picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris perceived something else: ``It was powerful to watch the
music flowing this way. (The musicians) were glancing up here
frequently for guidance. That's something I couldn't see from where
I was sitting at the back.''
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Thomas, a professor of anatomy, also had an opportunity
to help direct. It was, she admitted later, nerve-racking, and it
taxed her more than lecturing to 240 students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't loosen up,'' she said. Yet she did perceive a
``flowing feeling _ not like we were ordering it _ but the response
was immediate, the orchestra was already there.''
</P>
<P>
   Nierenberg said seminar participants everywhere had the same
reactions, even when they came from dysfunctional workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   It's also common, he said, for the juxtaposition of musicians
and management tips to quickly win over skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   At the session Monday, some of the back-row doubters, who
initially sat with arms crossed or heads down, or wearing slight
smirks _ body language that said they weren't buying into it _
appeared engaged within half an hour of Nierenberg's introduction.
Their bobbing heads and smiles spoke for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The skills of these professional musicians are the fundamental
building blocks of the organization,'' Nierenberg reminded the
participants. ``The `hard skill' of playing their instruments is
the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not enough to have the skills if they can't play to
fit in. They must play as a team. They must play as one.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizational leaders have the extra burden of providing vision
and direction, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``A leader must not just give orders. A leader must trust people
to do their jobs, not stifle them by command and control,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Nierenberg said, just as every member of a symphony
must play so listeners hear the most pleasing product, strong
organizations must have a customer focus ``so that everyone thinks
about their own jobs as they relate to the end product.''

A COOKOFF WITH A TASTE FOR OPENERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - I enjoyed a new culinary experience over the weekend.
I judged a chili cookoff.
</P>
<P>
   So what, you're thinking. And it's true _ as a known and devoted
glutton, I've judged plenty of cookoffs before. But this was
different.
</P>
<P>
   This was (begin ital) canned (end ital) chili.
</P>
<P>
   Just the words put you in mind of a reddish gelatinous goo that
slides out of the can with a THWOCK!, tastes like warmed-up sweat
socks and contains beans with the same texture as water chestnuts.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't what I tasted at the Third Annual Kaiser Bill
Memorial Canned Chili Cookoff, a benefit for the St. Vincent de
Paul Food Bank held in the scenic parking lot behind the Texaz
Grill, in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the canned chili was just the base _ cooks could
add whatever ingredients they wanted to the mix (with the exception
of better meat) _ so what we judges ended up tasting bore the same
relation to the canned chili you buy at the supermarket as filet
mignon has to Spam.
</P>
<P>
   Stagg and Wolf were the most popular brands. Rumors of secret
ingredients abounded, some more appetizing than others. A stuffed
armadillo adorned the table used by the ArtPharts _ a great chili
team name if ever there was one (they were from the Phoenix Art
Group).
</P>
<P>
   And he was missing some of his tail.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, one team member said. We didn't use the tail. We
used a paw. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Counting paws &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hey, wait _ didn't that violate the no-extra-meat rule, in
addition to violating my own policy of not eating meat from animals
that look like they are wearing medieval suits of mail?
</P>
<P>
   ``No meat,'' he said. ``Just claw.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he was kidding. I hope. And the armadillo still had
all four feet.
</P>
<P>
   We judged by passing around cups of chili and rating each. It's
a quick process, and the first few chilies go by quickly. Which is
dangerous, because by the sixth or seventh taste, all that chili
catches up to you and you suddenly feel as if you've swallowed an
anvil. Whole.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just the gastronomic effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``My nose is running, and I don't know which one caused it,''
former Arizona Gov. Rose Mofford, another judge, sniffed.
</P>
<P>
   When the judging was done, E.D. Baptist stood alone at the top,
despite someone taping a handmade sign to his table that said
``fried booger stew.'' He took second place last year, so you might
guess that he took that recipe and improved upon it. Perhaps a
year's worth of experimentation, tasting and honing until he found
just the right combination?
</P>
<P>
   Nah.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the life of me, I couldn't tell you what was in it,''
Baptist said. ``A little of this and a little of that. Onions,
peppers, a whole clove of garlic, all kinds of spices. Just a
little bit of everything.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Burned entry &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last place, and the plastic garbage can that accompanies that
honor, went to Dr. Chompers, who in real life is Carol Ford, a
dentist, and members of her office. What they lacked in cooking
ability, they more than made up for in good spirits. And intentions
_ they included a dollop of fluoride in their chili. Hope none of
the judges were John Birchers.
</P>
<P>
   Their chili suffered from a scorched taste, blamed upon smoked
chipotle peppers or too much cooking, depending on whom you asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a method,'' Sandy Perkins, a dental assistant, said.
``We didn't just throw in (ingredients) carelessly. Tequila, chili,
peppers, onions. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``And then we burned it,'' Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   Their table sat between members of the Phoenix and Gilbert,
Ariz., fire departments, and they had a nice little rivalry going.
Neither fire department won anything; after one of the firefighters
dumped a bucket of water on me (and except for my belly, I wasn't
even on fire), I can't say I was sorry.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the difference between a fireman and a puppy?'' Ford
asked. ``Puppies stop whining after six months.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just get their first names,'' a firefighter shot back,
``because they've all got the same last name _ ``Losers''!
</P>
<P>
   But there were no losers, really. Unless you count my digestive
system. &QL;

SUPREME COURT TAKES UP COMPETITION IN THE LOCAL PHONE MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDs: FILED in ``w'' and ``f'' categories)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration urged the Supreme Court
Tuesday to reinstate federal rules designed to break up monopolies
in the $100 billion local phone industry.
</P>
<P>
   Solicitor General Seth Waxman told the justices that the rules,
which would be administered by the Federal Communications
Commission, would allow free competition in the local phone market
to grow ``rapidly and throughout the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But Diane Munns, representing state utility regulators, argued
that the rules would take away the right of state governments to
oversee communication companies operating within their borders.
</P>
<P>
   She maintained that ``the FCC doesn't have a role with respect
to pricing unless the state fails to act.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Justice Antonin Scalia said that if her contention is
correct, ``you could have 50 different states having 50 different
regulations ... until they were all litigated out.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the early days of the telephone, state governments have
controlled intrastate communications while the federal government _
primarily through the FCC _ has had jurisdiction over interstate
and foreign communications.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1996 Congress passed the Telecommunications Act, which
was designed to break up local telephone monopolies and to open
those markets to free competition.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve these goals, the act authorized the FCC to set
regulations that would allow an outside competitor to get into the
local phone business by building its own network, leasing parts of
existing local phone networks or by buying a local service and
reselling it to customers. That would offer Americans, for the
first time, a choice in local service.
</P>
<P>
   Existing local phone companies and state utility commissions
objected, saying that the FCC had no right to meddle in state
telecommunications business.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 the 8th U.S. Court of Appeals in St. Louis agreed,
striking down the regulations. It ruled that the states _ not the
federal government _ have the power to regulate local phone
service.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court also invalidated several FCC rules that
required existing local phone companies to sell parts or all of
their service networks to outside competitors for no profit.
</P>
<P>
   In his argument Tuesday Waxman said the federal regulations were
needed to foster competition in the local phone industry.
</P>
<P>
   He said that some federal control over the local phone industry
was needed because the line between interstate and intrastate
communications was becoming ``blurred.'' Waxman said local phone
companies now provide services such as long distance and Internet
access that extend beyond state lines.
</P>
<P>
   He said that under the FCC rules, state governments would retain
the right to oversee and, at times, to set the price that outside
firms would pay for leasing local phone networks from existing
companies _ although those prices would be within guidelines set by
the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   But Munns said the authority to set price guidelines and other
rules must be reserved to the states. ``Since 1934, that power has
been given to the states,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and the Clinton administration hope that competition in
the local phone market would have the same impact on local phones
rates that the 1984 breakup of the Bell system had on the
long-distance phone rates, which have dropped by more than 70
percent since then.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme court also heard arguments Tuesday from lawyers for
existing local phone companies. They objected to the 1996 law's
provisions that would allow outside companies to lease parts or all
of an existing phone company's network at wholesale rates.
</P>
<P>
   William Barr, representing several local phone carriers, said
the act would ``destroy'' any competitive edge that his clients
possessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``For existing phone companies, any system or process that they
develop which would help them beat their competitors would
immediately be available at cost to those same competitors,'' he
said. ``It's ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr suggested the act be changed so that outside companies,
such as AT&AMP;T and MCI, could lease only the parts of a local phone
network that they could not build or buy on their own, such as
underground phone wires. ``New entrants to the market should be
allowed to buy what they need, not what they want from existing
phone companies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Carpenter, lawyer for the FCC, said the agency would
monitor the local markets to make sure that outside firms did not
take advantage of existing phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   The justices are expected to issue a decision by July.

   In 1997 the 8th U.S. Court of Appeals in St. Louis agreed,
striking down the regulations. It ruled that the states _ not the
federal government _ have the power to regulate local phone
service.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court also invalidated several FCC rules that
required existing local phone companies to sell parts or all of
their service networks to outside competitors for no profit.
</P>
<P>
   In his argument Tuesday Waxman said the federal regulations were
needed to foster competition in the local phone industry.
</P>
<P>
   He said that some federal control over the local phone industry
was needed because the line between interstate and intrastate
communications was becoming ``blurred.'' Waxman said local phone
companies now provide services such as long distance and Internet
access that extend beyond state lines.
</P>
<P>
   He said that under the FCC rules, state governments would retain
the right to oversee and, at times, to set the price that outside
firms would pay for leasing local phone networks from existing
companies _ although those prices would be within guidelines set by
the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   But Munns said the authority to set price guidelines and other
rules must be reserved to the states. ``Since 1934, that power has
been given to the states,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and the Clinton administration hope that competition in
the local phone market would have the same impact on local phones
rates that the 1984 breakup of the Bell system had on the
long-distance phone rates, which have dropped by more than 70
percent since then.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme court also heard arguments Tuesday from lawyers for
existing local phone companies. They objected to the 1996 law's
provisions that would allow outside companies to lease parts or all
of an existing phone company's network at wholesale rates.
</P>
<P>
   William Barr, representing several local phone carriers, said
the act would ``destroy'' any competitive edge that his clients
possessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``For existing phone companies, any system or process that they
develop which would help them beat their competitors would
immediately be available at cost to those same competitors,'' he
said. ``It's ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr suggested the act be changed so that outside companies,
such as AT&AMP;T and MCI, could lease only the parts of a local phone
network that they could not build or buy on their own, such as
underground phone wires. ``New entrants to the market should be
allowed to buy what they need, not what they want from existing
phone companies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Carpenter, lawyer for the FCC, said the agency would
monitor the local markets to make sure that outside firms did not
take advantage of existing phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   The justices are expected to issue a decision by July.

EFFORTS TO PROTECT SEA TURTLES SUFFERS SETBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A campaign to protect endangered sea turtles
suffered a key setback when the World Trade Organization ruled that
the United States cannot force other countries to equip their
shrimp boats with devices that enable turtles to escape shrimp
nets.
</P>
<P>
   In a 90-page decision, the WTO said Monday that the United
States cannot impose its environmental standards on other
countries, even if those standards were established to save species
from extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Steiner, executive director of Earth Island Institute's Sea
Turtle Restoration Institute, said the decision ``begins a downward
spiral which will dismantle many U.S. environmental laws.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort to protect the endangered sea turtles was initiated
by the San Francisco-based Earth Island Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of the decision is to ``allow our standards to be
reduced to the lowest common denominator of any of our trading
partners. This is absurd and not acceptable,'' Steiner said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. law requires all shrimpers to use nets with ``turtle
exclusion devices'' _ trap doors in trawl nets that enable turtles
to escape after they've been scooped up with the shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   The law also forbids the importation of shrimp caught in nets
that do not have those devices, but it was not enforced until 1995,
when Earth Island Institute sued the State Department and won.
</P>
<P>
   The Earth Island Institute estimates that 150,000 sea turtles
drown annually because they are caught in shrimp nets.
</P>
<P>
   India, Malaysia, Pakistan and Thailand challenged the U.S.
embargo against their shrimp catches before the WTO in April and
won. The United States appealed _ and lost.
</P>
<P>
   The United States now has two choices: either allow shrimp
imports without restrictions or continue to enforce the law and
face trade sanctions from the four countries, said Martin Wanger,
international programs director for the Earth Justice Legal Defense
Fund in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the State Department was ``a reluctant defender'' of
the requirement that all shrimping nations use nets that protect
turtles, Wagner said he doubted the United States would continue to
enforce the law.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky insisted that the
ruling would not affect its efforts to protect endangered sea
turtles. But Steiner said ``the spin she's putting on the ruling is
nothing but fantasy and wishful thinking.''

 &HT;    TECH INDUSTRY PUSHES TO SAVE INTERNET TAX BAN
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARY BETH REGAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ E-commerce advocates are pressing Congress to save
a bill banning new Internet taxes, amid a flurry of last-minute
lobbying that may result in one of the most productive legislative
sessions yet for the high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists were scrambling late Tuesday to shore up support among
Republican House members for the Internet Tax Freedom Act, which
cleared the Senate with overwhelming support last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leadership has signaled its intent to put
portions of the bill into the massive omnibus spending bill now
making its way through the Congress. ``It's impossible to imagine
this being left on the cutting room floor,'' said Rep. Christopher
Cox , R-Calif., who sponsored the House version of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still unclear how this is going to get done,'' said Jill
Lesser, a lobbyist for America Online Inc. ``But we're optimistic
that we'll end up with an Internet tax bill.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would bar taxes for three years on Internet
access fees, such as the monthly connection charge by AOL, as well
as new taxes that apply solely to electronic commerce. However, the
bill would allow existing local Internet taxes to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators were also weighing what other parts of the Senate
bill to include in the omnibus spending measure. The Senate bill
includes provisions that would protect children's privacy on line,
recognize digital signatures as authentic, require Internet service
providers to make filtering software available, and restrict
on-line speech deemed ``harmful to minors.''
</P>
<P>
   If lobbyists are successful in pushing the Internet tax bill
through, this week's last-minute lobbying will have resulted in a
stunning string of victories for the nation's high-tech community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have accomplished most of our legislative agenda,''
said Ira C. Magaziner, President Clinton's senior policy adviser
for Internet issues.
</P>
<P>
   The major victories include a measure to more than double the
number of visas for foreign-born high-tech workers, which also will
be tucked into the overall spending bill. Under the compromise, the
visa ceiling would rise to 115,000 over the next two years from
65,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
   A measure to protect online copyrights that passed the House
late Monday likely also will become law.
</P>
<P>
   The Digital Millennium Copyright Act updates the U.S. copyright
laws to protect products such as software, musical recordings and
software. It also protects Internet service providers from
liability if their customers infringe on copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   But lobbyists aren't popping the champagne yet. ``We're not
going to celebrate until President Clinton signs this into law,''
said Jon Englund, senior vice president of the Information
Technology Association of America, which represents the software
industry.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A potent jet stream disturbance will sweep toward the Northeast
Coast preceded by a broken area of showers. As additional moisture
is drawn into the system, briefly heavy showers and some rumbles of
thunder will occur near a front from the Hudson River valley to the
New England coast. As the front slows later Wednesday, a steady
rain may develop across northern and eastern New England. In the
wake of the front, gusty winds from the northwest will import
chilly air from eastern Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Southeast will have abundant sunshine with a
comfortably warm afternoon as high pressure moves east from the
Mississippi Valley. Isolated showers will erupt in the more humid
air mass over southern and eastern Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Warm air will spread north from the southern Plains as breezes
from the south increase. As the warmth encounters a cooler air mass
in place over the northern parts of the Plains and Mississippi
Valley, clouds and a few showers will develop, especially near the
Missouri River. Meanwhile, sunshine will be plentiful in the warm
air from Kansas to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A complex storm system will initially have limited moisture as
it begins to develop over the Rockies. Cool air will spread south
through the northern Rockies accompanied by a few light showers.
Wednesday night and Thursday, more widespread showers and mountain
snow will develop as the storm strengthens. In the Pacific
Northwest, onshore winds will promote showers and some snow in the
Cascades above 5000 feet. Meanwhile, the Southwest will be warm and
dry.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: A Change of Pace
</P>
<P>
   Autumn weather is a marked change of pace. Afternoon
temperatures in the balmy 60s and 70s in the Rockies early this
week will yield to the locally heavy mountain snow by Thursday.
Weather moves about twice as fast at this time of year compared to
the summer season. During the autumn, the deepening Arctic chill
advances southward from Canada as tropical warmth clings to the
southernmost United States. This temperature contrast is the fuel
for the jet stream winds which steer the parade of weather systems
that march to an ever-quickening drum beat.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ ``Gak!'' is one expression likely to burst from a
visitor. Also ``Agh!' and ``Yew!'' Or here and there, a more
articulate ``Hoo boy! Is that bad!''
</P>
<P>
   Beautifully bad. Mind-bogglingly bad. As bad as this: a
pointillist rendering of a footless, corpulent man seated on a
toilet in only his undershorts and titled ``Sunday on the Pot with
George.'' Or a portrait of a frowning, slack-busted old woman
sitting in an office chair in a field of flowers against a yellow
sky. Or a shrunken, mud-colored papier-mache pirate's head
protruding from an aqua seascape canvas, a truly astonishing,
bowling-ball-size excrescence.
</P>
<P>
   So bad that the paintings become _ well, not good, but at least
somehow worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   For though the Museum of Bad Art might seem at first to be
nothing but a joke, an elaborate sendup of the snooty pretension
and dictated taste of the professional art world, it also has a
positive point, its founders say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say we're celebrating the right to fail,'' said Scott
Wilson, an antiques dealer who is the museum's curator, which means
he decides which paintings are too good to enter the collection.
</P>
<P>
   The works accepted by the museum, said Marie Jackson, its
director of esthetic interpretation, ``are done with enthusiasm,
with sincerity of purpose, with exuberance, with everything going
for them _ except that something's gone horribly awry.''
</P>
<P>
   Think of the collection, said Jerry Reilly, its executive
director, as the equivalent of songs sung by people in the shower.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are millions and millions of people who paint but have
no aspirations to be the next Monet,'' he said. ``Just as someone
singing in the shower is not singing to be the next Frank Sinatra.
They just sing because they love it. These are paintings from
people who just paint because they love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Art connoisseurs could never love the results. The museum, which
charges no entrance fee and is housed in the locker-room-like
basement of the community theater in the Boston suburb of Dedham,
even sells T-shirts that read, ``In our museum, it's not the
artists that are tortured.''
</P>
<P>
   But funnily enough, for all that it is based on failure, the
museum is an ever more resounding success.
</P>
<P>
   Its beginnings could hardly have been more humble. In 1993,
Wilson rescued the portrait of the old woman against the yellow sky
(since named ``Lucy in the Field with Flowers'') from some trash.
He was interested in its gilded frame, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not long afterward, his friend Reilly, a computer programmer
with a penchant for elaborate pranks and celebrations, laid eyes on
it. And, said Wilson with the mock pomposity common among the
museum's tongue-in-cheek crowd: ``There was a feeling that
something bigger than all of us was happening. Jerry asked me, `Is
there anything else like this out there?' And I said, `Oh, yeah, I
see it all the time.'''
</P>
<P>
   The museum began to take form in the basement of Reilly and Ms.
Jackson's house. Five years later, the Museum of Bad Art has a book
out under its name subtitled ``Art too bad to be ignored'' (1996,
Andrews and McMeel, Kansas City) and a CD-ROM (distributed by
Backyard Computing of Needham, Mass.), and is well visited at its
Web site (http://www.glyphs.com/moba/). Thousands receive the
museum's newsletter, the most active volunteers have been awarded
highfalutin titles and nearly 3,000 patrons have become ``Friends
of MOBA.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks the museum has sent out traveling
exhibitions to Calgary, Canada, and to Arlington, Va. The paintings
are accompanied by texts like this one for a blurry ``Madonna and
Child'': ``A work of undisputed tenderness that places the
spiritual above the physical through careful disregard for details
of the human form.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit of about 70 pieces of bad art at the Ellipse Art
Center in Arlington has proved so popular that visitors have been
dragging their co-workers in to enjoy it, said Trudi Van Dyke, the
gallery's curator.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going right through the gallery and laughing out
loud,'' she said. ``We've never had anything like this before.''
</P>
<P>
   The show was relatively simple to put on, she said, because she
did not have to worry about insurance for the artworks or fancy
transport arrangements. ``They just sort of boxed it up and threw
it on a Mayflower,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Bad Art has a policy of never paying more than
$6.50 for a work of art, its founders say, and, in fact, it almost
never has to pay anything, so eager are bad-art owners around the
country to unload their anti-treasures. It also has a hard-and-fast
policy of never sending back art that has been submitted.
</P>
<P>
   But it actually accepts into its permanent collection only about
one of every 10 works it is given; it rejects all reproductions,
works on black velvet and other cliched kitsch, obvious student
exercises and bad art that was deliberately made badly rather than
just turning out that way.
</P>
<P>
   Still, submitting a piece to the museum is always a win-win
proposition, Ms. Jackson said. All the museum's known artists have
been happy to be exhibited: ``If you get in, you can say you've got
a piece in a museum,'' she said. ``And if your work's rejected,
you're officially not bad: you're certified not bad by the world's
leading authority on bad art.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To some, the museum's picky criteria and the gusto with which
its founders explain them amount to a sort of long-running
performance art parodying traditional museum selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've found this just fascinating, that they basically take the
model of a museum of fine arts and apply the same kind of criteria
to acceptance for bad work,'' said Dean Nimmer, a painter and
longtime professor at the Massachusetts College of Art, in Boston.
Rules like the one against black velvet, he said, ``are very
similar to a gallery or museum that says, `Well, our area is really
installation art or realist paintings or neo-postmodern
abstractions.'''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, said Nimmer, whose affiliation with the museum
affords him the lofty but little-used title of ``executive director
of good taste,'' it is heartening to see a place created for the
kind of artist who has no hope of being shown in a mainstream
museum or gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like a comedian who winds up making very poignant
social commentary without intending to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's founders emphasize that they are not in any way
anti-art or anti-artist _ quite the opposite. ``There are people
who have frowned on us and said we're taking these poor innocent
people's work and twisting it,'' Wilson said, ``and that's not what
we're about. We're celebrating the artist.''
</P>
<P>
   The founders say they are also giving viewers a direct
connection to a painting, circumventing the usual priesthood of
curators and critics, and allowing comments in full voice instead
of the hush of typical museums and openings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regularly,'' Reilly recounted, ``people say: `There's nothing
wrong with that! I think that's a good painting!' Everyone feels
completely at ease; people don't kowtow to the central process.''
</P>
<P>
   So what now for the world-renowned Museum of Bad Art? Its
founders are toying with an exhibition called ``Art in the Gutter''
that would involve hanging bad paintings in a bowling alley.
Previous exhibitions have included the ``I Just Can't Stop'' show,
which focused on certain artists' tendencies to produce a great
many similar bad works.
</P>
<P>
   Nimmer said he hoped the museum would branch out into truly bad
needlepoint, crocheting and long-fiber fabric work _ for example,
an artistic '70s-style shag carpet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The piece I have, the fibers are two inches long and it's a
squirrel with a nut, and the nut looks like it's oozing, everything
is melting in it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson ``liked it,'' Nimmer said, ``but I don't think he's ready
for shag.''  &QL;

`LIKE NEVER BEFORE': THE LINE BETWEEN LOVING AND CURSING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: publication notes are at end of review) 
(bl) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a moment in Ehud Havazelet's new book, ``Like Never
Before,'' that incarnates the distilled bitterness, the melancholy
sting, of this quietly powerful collection of stories. Max
Birnbaum, the distracted and ineffectual son of a famous rabbi from
Cracow and the father of two disappointing children, is in his
living room in Queens speaking to his wife, Esther, who is dying of
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love them,'' he says abruptly, speaking of his children,
David and Rachel, whose estrangement from their parents exemplifies
Havazelet's view of human relations as battles nearly to the death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell them that,'' Esther replies. And then:
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell them,'' he sneers. ``That I never will understand them,
how they live?'' Max thinks about his long-dead brother, killed by
the Nazis, and he has Job-like thoughts of God: ``That every
morning I curse him for a traitor and I curse them for the
unhappiness they bring.'' His hands make a gesture of futility.
``You too,'' he says, ``for tricking me like this, for leaving.
Every morning I curse you all, and then I curse myself. I should
tell them that?''
</P>
<P>
   Havazelet, who got respectful attention for ``What Is It Then
Between Us?,'' his first collection of stories, proves himself
again an impressively talented writer in ``Like Never Before,'' a
book that lives on the precarious edge between loving and cursing.
A series of independent but related stories, the new book consists
of intense, often searing scenes from three generations of a
spiritually wounded Polish Jewish family living in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Havazelet writes with a kind of anatomical precision, his
scalpel slicing at his characters to expose the dark reality
beneath. He has a sharp, almost grotesque wit, a fine ear for the
eccentric cadences of lower-middle-class New York Jews and an
unsentimental compassion for the scars they bear.
</P>
<P>
   The first story, ``Six Days,'' sets the scene, etching in the
relationship between Birnbaum and his son that will emerge as the
central conflict of Havazelet's collection of vignettes. Birnbaum
teaches in a Hebrew day school, living in the shadow of his father,
the rabbi of an Orthodox Brooklyn congregation. One Yom Kippur, in
his father's synagogue, prayers are interrupted when David and a
friend, playing ball outside (already a sacrilege), break a
synagogue window with a ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boy saw his father's eyes, the look in them. He's going to
kill me, he thought. Birnbaum leaned over, grunting words he didn't
recognize. He tried to reach with his fists, but he couldn't, so he
began using his feet on the red-faced creature scuttling away from
him on its back near the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Light of This World,'' which describes a day in the life of
three truants from the Hebrew Day School, it becomes clear that
there is a cruelty in David that goes beyond the normal cruelty of
children. Havazelet provides a flashback in the next story,
``Lyon,'' where Birnbaum, then 16 and known as Maxim Birnboym, and
his older brother, Rachmil, both refugees from Cracow, collect
money to pay for Jews to be smuggled across the border into
Switzerland. This brief excursion into Birnbaum's past is all the
more powerful because it is so brief, and only once more referred
to _ in Birnbaum's acrid comment to his dying wife.
</P>
<P>
   The brief incident, written with a kind of verbal suddenness
reminiscent of Isaac Babel, tells almost all one needs to know
about the troubled fate of the Birnbaum family. It is not only the
sins of the fathers that are visited upon the sons, Havazelet seems
to be saying. It is more importantly the wounds that have been
inflicted upon them and that they struggle without success to keep
to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The most brilliantly executed piece in the collection may be
``Leah,'' which is the story of Rachel, David's sister, told
through her relationship with a female cousin exactly her age, a
kind of inverse doppelganger. While Rachel shares David's
rebelliousness, she is more lost than vengeful. David, whose look
is one of ``quiet outrage, detachment, the aloof expectation of
pain,'' is a disturbed and disturbing figure, shown by Havazelet in
an almost luridly bright and unforgiving light.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Leah'' we see him as a 17-year-old full of mockery,
contempt and self-punishment, a boy who spreads a dark shadow
around him. We later glimpse his marriage to a non-Jewish woman
named Maura, who fails to evoke a sympathetic response in her
husband when a neighbor is murdered. David by now has become an
architect, intelligent and ambitious, but he is so damaged and
self-punishing as to be unwitting in his cruelty. He falls in love
with a young woman at work, comes home late one night and wakes
Maura to tell her the news. ``What was happening to him was
unusual,'' he thinks in his solipsistic way; ``if it happened to
you once in your life you were lucky. Could she try and see that?''
</P>
<P>
   Havazelet tells these stories with a remarkable economy and
stylistic precision, the characters emerging in just a few quick
strokes. ``His mouth, through his thick ungainly beard, was a wet
red hole glistening with teeth,'' he writes of an early suitor of
Rachel's cousin Leah. When Birnbaum is introduced to David's second
non-Jewish wife, he takes it as ``one more signal that his life, so
meagerly lit, was about to get darker still.''
</P>
<P>
   There is very little in the way of redemption in Havazelet's
vision of subtly but irrevocably afflicted lives, only a small
flicker of possible understanding between David and Rachel near the
end. When Birnbaum, his wife dead, goes to Seattle to try to settle
his accounts with David, living there with his wife and two young
children, even the effort of the two men to embrace is a failure.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of reading Havazelet's stories is one well on the
dark side of poignancy, but it is also one of pleasure at the
realization of a striking talent.

CLINTON WARNS MILOSEVIC: BRING PEACE TO KOSOVO PROVINCE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Keeping pressure on Yugoslavia, President Clinton
warned President Slobodan Milosevic on Tuesday that he must
demonstrate by deeds, not words, his intentions to bring peace to
Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic agreed on Monday to a series of concessions, including
the pullback of armed forces that have attacked ethnic Albanian
civilians and the arrival of 2,000 international inspectors to
verify his compliance. NATO gave Milosevic 96 hours to comply or
face an airstrike.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commitments he has made could lead _ and I emphasize the
word `could' _ to the peaceful resolution of a crisis that
threatens the stability of the Balkans, and the lives of tens of
thousands of refugees, many of them homeless,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for that to happen, we must see progress as President
Milosevic turns his commitments into concrete realities,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not rely on what President Milosevic says, but on what
he does for the whole world to see. To that end, a key component of
the commitments he has made is an intrusive, on-the-ground and
in-the-air verification system,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Milosevic, leader of the ethnic Serb majority
in the former Communist nation, sent in the Yugoslav army and
police to put down a rebellion by ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Since
then, hundreds of Kosovar Albanians have been killed and 300,000
left homeless by Milosevic's forces.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, the Yugoslavian capital, Milosevic appeared on
television to announce the agreement. He said the accord will
``avert the danger of a military intervention against our country.
Our task is to accelerate the political process and economic
recovery of our country as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough came after marathon negotiations by U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke and after an international military response
seemed imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke also cautioned that the emergency was not over yet and
that Milosevic must abide by the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot stress too highly how deeply concerned we are about
what happened in the past few months in Kosovo ... the unnecessary
horror of it,'' Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
   Just prior to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization action,
Milosevic agreed to continue an 11-day cease-fire, withdraw new
troops sent to Kosovo and garrison the rest, permit full access by
international monitors and allow humanitarian relief agencies to
provide services to the thousands of homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Americans will be among the 2,000 international inspectors who
will be sent to the region to verify that Milosevic is in
compliance. Administration officials could not say how many
Americans would be involved in the mission being formed by the
55-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE).
</P>
<P>
   Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger, Clinton's national security adviser,
said the 2,000 inspectors will have authority to ``establish
permanent presences at any location in Kosovo,'' as well as to
accompany Serb police and troops, coordinate relief efforts, return
refugees to their homes, supervise elections, establish
institutions and local police and demand removal or punishment of
those people violating compliance.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, NATO will provide air surveillance, with
participation by United States forces, to verify compliance as
well. Navy Capt. Mike Doubleday, a Pentagon spokesman, said NATO
also expected to station a ``rapid reaction'' military force near
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Doubleday said the U.S. military would not likely be apart of
the rapid reaction team. However, U.S. spy planes would be
available for reconnaissance missions and U.S. war planes could be
a part of a protection force for unarmed NATO planes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said NATO planes would have unrestricted access to Kosovo
air space and Milosevic will remove or store away air defense
systems.
</P>
<P>
   He said the verification mission will remain in Kosovo ``so long
as it's necessary'' and ``certainly months'' will be required.
Berger said that within the four-day deadline set by NATO, ``we
have to see serious progress'' by Milosevic toward meeting his
obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called verification the key to peace.
</P>
<P>
   The president referred to the international inspectors as
``watchdogs'' who will ensure the cease-fire holds and that Serb
forces withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international community prefers compliance to conflict.
But in voting to give our military commanders the authority to
carry out airstrikes against Serbia, NATO sent a clear message to
President Milosevic _ NATO is ready to act,'' Clinton said. ``It is
now up to the president of Serbia to follow through on his
commitments.''
</P>
<P>
   The Balkans have been in turmoil since the collapse of
Communist-ruled Yugoslavia led to internal battles between ethnic
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 nations of NATO authorized the use of force Monday night
to enforce a United Nations resolution aimed at forcing Milosevic
to stop the attacks on Kosovar Albanian civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the 2 million people
living in Kosovo. The agreement calls for Milosevic to allow
elections next year for an autonomous, but not independent, Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the second time NATO authorized the use of force and
the first involving the internal affairs of a nation.
</P>
<P>
   NATO previously authorized airstrikes in Bosnia where the Serb
minority backed by Milosevic waged war against Muslims and Croats.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke helped fashion the peace accord in Bosnia which led
the the partitioning of that country into a Serb Republic and the
Muslim-Croat Federation. U.S. ground troops have been in Bosnia
since the 1995 peace accord. &QL;

DETOUR FOR AMERICAN THEATER, DIRECTION UNCERTAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  Frank Rich, an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times and its
former chief theater critic, is the author of ``Hot Seat: Theater
Criticism for The New York Times, 1980-1993,'' which is being
published this week by Random House. 
(For release Sunday, Oct. 18) 
(bl) 
 By FRANK RICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you love the theater, or are part of it, or even writing
about it, then everything's a drama.
</P>
<P>
   When I joined The New York Times as a drama critic in 1980, I
had no idea that there would be so many offstage events that would
be part of my beat.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't have imagined that director Gower Champion's death
would be announced from the stage by the producer David Merrick on
the opening night of ``42nd Street.'' Or that Joseph Papp would
lead a fierce protest two blocks from my office to try
(unsuccessfully, of course) to halt the demolition of three
theaters, including the Morosco (hallowed site of the premiere of
``Death of a Salesman''), to make way for a towering Marriott
hotel. Or that the theatrical community would be decimated by an
epidemic, as yet unnamed and unremarked, like AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   When 13 years later I moved on, somewhat sadder and (I hope)
more than somewhat wiser, the landscape was unrecognizable _ and
not just because of the vanished old theaters. The hottest play in
town was a two-part, eight-hour ``gay fantasia'' known as ``Angels
in America,'' Disney was toying with sticking its first toe
(``Beauty and the Beast'') into Broadway, and Neil Simon, whose
plays for better and worse had defined Broadway for three decades,
was being exiled by economic realities to a small playhouse dozens
of blocks from Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Now nearly another five years have passed, and the American
theater seems poised for an even more dramatic and far more rapid
shift _ perhaps the most momentous systemic change since the rise
of off-Broadway and the regional theater movement in the 1950s, or
even since the onslaught of television in the decade before that.
And again, the biggest story is happening offstage.
</P>
<P>
   After generations of being a backwater to the big-money,
mass-audience show business mainstream of movies, television and
the recording industry, the American theater is no longer secluded
in its own idiosyncratic world where it can be entirely the master
(however erratic and self-destructive) of its own fate.
</P>
<P>
   Like book publishing before it _ until the last decade, another
quaint holdout against the forces of media consolidation _ the
theater is now becoming ``content'' suitable for synergistic
annexation and exploitation by our new entertainment conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   What prompts me to take stock of the theater's recent past and
looming future is the time I recently spent compiling ``Hot Seat:
Theater Criticism for The New York Times, 1980-1993,'' an anthology
of the drama reviews I wrote for The Times. Confronting an
avalanche of old clippings for the first time in years, I
re-encountered some great nights and artists that remain indelible,
as well as some fabulous fiascoes, like ``Moose Murders'' and
``Carrie,'' that linger almost as brightly as triumphs like
``Sunday in the Park With George'' and ``Glengarry Glen Ross.''
</P>
<P>
   I also discovered that other plays, including some I had
praised, had vanished entirely from memory.
</P>
<P>
   My editor suggested that I acknowledge this new perspective by
adding retrospective afterthoughts to my reviews and, for fun,
create an appendix with lists not just of bests and worsts but also
of plays that I now feel I had overestimated (starting with Sam
Shepard's ``Lie of the Mind'') and underestimated (``Nicholas
Nickleby'') the first time around.
</P>
<P>
   Rocco Landesman, the rare Broadway producer who is actually a
reformed drama critic, has long griped that one of the worst things
about critics is that they never admit to making mistakes. He's
right. It was certainly liberating to admit to mine, now that I had
some historical distance that allowed me to look at the record
fresh and recognize them.
</P>
<P>
   (Though some of that historical perspective is simply the
vicissitudes of age; in another 20 years, maybe I'll even look back
fondly on ``Aspects of Love.'')
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest, most humbling mistake I discovered _ and I feel
only slightly defensive about it, since everyone else in or around
the theater made it, too _ was my utter failure to anticipate the
single most important change on Broadway in decades: the arrival of
Disney as a redevelopment force, which led in turn to the happy
revival of 42nd Street and the entire Times Square neighborhood
but, less happily, to the impending corporatization of the American
theater, on Broadway and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   From this discovery it was only a sobering moment until I
realized that, whatever my lists of bests and worsts, there was
only one candidate for the honor of ``most influential'' production
during my time as drama critic.
</P>
<P>
   The winner, without question, is ``Cats.''
</P>
<P>
   I am not talking about the quality of this musical or lack of
same _ a mirthless debate even in 1982 _ or its marathon run, now
and perhaps forever the longest in Broadway history.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, ``Cats'' is ``most influential'' in terms of its
mega-influence on the national theatrical culture. ``Cats''
outlasted its critics, outlasted umpteen casts, outlasted
English-speaking audiences, even outlasted the career of its
principal creator, Andrew Lloyd Webber, who hasn't had a hit in
more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   But now, 16 years after its New York opening, the new world that
the American theater is entering _ the world typified but not
exclusively represented by Disney _ is the one that ``Cats'' has
made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cats'' proved as no production had before that there was an
infinite tourist audience for a theatrical attraction (as opposed
to, say, a circus, Las Vegas revue or Radio City Music Hall
pageant) in which spectacle trumped (or perhaps Trumped) content
and no English was required for comprehension, whether by young
children or foreign visitors.

CLINTON AND GOP BATTLE OVER EDUCATION SPENDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the budget battle between the White House and
Congress in the final phase, President Clinton visited overcrowded
classrooms Tuesday to dramatize his insistence that the 1999
federal budget include money to hire new teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders on Capitol Hill countered that the $1.1
billion sought by Clinton for new teachers should instead be
funneled directly to local school districts to enable the nation's
16,000 school districts to decide how to spend the money, whether
on teachers' salaries or training or educational materials.
</P>
<P>
   The dueling education proposals three weeks before the Nov. 3
mid-term elections underscore how Democrats and Republicans are
trying to address a pressing concern of the parents of the 52.7
million school children enrolled this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-election polls show that voters rank education second only
to the global economic crisis as their most important concern. A
Newsweek survey published Monday found 23 percent ranked education
as their chief worry compared to 27 percent who ranked the global
economic crisis as their No. 1 concern. Only 14 percent gave top
billing to the congressional inquiry into Clinton's relationship
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Voters will decide on all 435 seats in the House, where 218
Republicans out number the 206 Democrats and one independent.
Voters are deciding 35 Senate seats in November. The GOP has a 55
to 45 advantage in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle highlighted the conflicting approach by Democrats
and Republicans to federal assistance to local education. Democrats
favor wide-ranging federal support for public education.
Republicans insist on local control over all aspects of education,
including facets subsidized by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants Congress to appropriate $1.1 billion as the
initial downpayment on a $12 billion proposal to hire 100,000 new
teachers over seven years to help cut average class size to 18
through the third grade.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also wants Congress to begin appropriating the
first part of $5 billion in proposed spending over five years to
help schools modernize their buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's other education proposals include requests to
establish national achievement tests for reading in the fourth
grade and for math in the eight grade to make sure students are
learning what they need to learn for a high tech economy.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on Capitol Hill favor a less ambitious federal role
in education. Republicans favor establishment of tax deferred
education savings account and the creation of a voucher system to
help private school students pay for private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, at a hurriedly arranged visit to the Forest Knolls
Elementary School in nearby Silver Spring, Md., appealed for
congressional support for his proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office _ the investigative arm of
Congress _ reports that 14 million U.S. school children attend
classes in schools that need ``extensive repair or replacement of
one or more buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton declared: ``I don't believe a country that says it's OK
for a huge number of its children to stay in trailers indefinitely
is serious about preparing them all for the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appearance at the school was his fourth straight day
of highlighting his view that there should be more federal spending
for public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the House Committee on
Education and the Workforce, appealed to the president to move
toward the Republican approach.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is ``going to have to make up his mind on whether he
wants an issue for the fall congressional campaigns or whether he
wants to work with us and accomplish something for our children,''
Goodling said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., chairman of the House Republicans'
campaign committee, said that his colleagues are eager to hit the
hustings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to get back and campaign,'' Linder said.

<P>
   Negotiations appeared to be in the final stages, with the White
House team led by chief of staff Erskine Bowles shuttling to
Capitol Hill to bargain budget details with the GOP congressional
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The final budget package is designed to wrap together eight of
the 13 annual spending bills that had not become law by Oct. 1 when
fiscal 199 got underway.
</P>
<P>
   The measures _ including action on Clinton's request for $33.6
billion in federal spending on education _ would total about $500
billion _ or nearly one-third of the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton signed a third continuing resolution late Monday to
continue federal operations without interruption until Wednesday
midnight to give the White House and Congress time to work out
spending disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and Congress fought to a budget standstill in
the fall of 1995, leading to two partial shutdowns in federal
operations,

 UNDATED: foreign visitors.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In conjunction with the rise of ticket prices into the
stratosphere during its run, ``Cats'' soon made it difficult for
adult, conventionally scaled musicals to compete in the commercial
theater's marketplace. Why pay the same high ticket price for a
show, consumers asked, that didn't have a levitating spaceship or a
falling chandelier but only good songs, compelling characters or
provocative drama?
</P>
<P>
   A very few smaller-scale musicals, like ``Rent'' and ``Bring In
da Noise, Bring In da Funk,'' have bucked the odds, but they are
anomalies. Straight plays, already an endangered species when
``Cats'' opened, have fared even worse. Drama on Broadway now
pretty much means exclusively British imports and one-person shows.
There is no major (or even semi-major) American playwright with a
new work scheduled for Broadway this season _ and it's not because
American playwrights aren't writing.
</P>
<P>
   The lasting influence of ``Cats'' is felt not just in the
ascendancy of spectacles. With its environmental set and
audience-pawing performers, ``Cats'' (and its immediate Lloyd
Webber sequel, the roller-skating ``Starlight Express'') also
anticipated the kind of national theatrical franchise, from ``Tony
and Tina's Wedding'' to ``Late Nite Catechism,'' in which the
``interactive'' theatrical experience becomes virtually
indistinguishable from theme parks and theme restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, ``Cats'' is the show that led indirectly but
inexorably to Disney's arrival on Broadway a decade later by
proving, first, that Broadway musicals could be marketed in a
big-budget, Hollywood-style ``branding'' blitz (previously unknown
in an industry that was suspicious of television commercials until
the 1970s) and, second, that there was a huge profit to be made in
exploiting animated characters on a Broadway stage. The characters
of ``The Lion King,'' at the gorgeously restored Ziegfeld palace
the New Amsterdam, are literally descendants of the cats of
``Cats,'' with the gifted director Julie Taymor providing the
illusion of highbrow gloss to the kiddie show that British director
Trevor Nunn and (involuntarily) T.S. Eliot lent to their feline
ancestors at another former Ziegfeld roost, the Winter Garden.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing wrong with a ``Cats'' or a ``Lion King'' as
part of the Broadway mix _ if it actually were a mix _ but what
``Lion King'' helped bring to Broadway (as ``Cats'' did not) is a
corporate sensibility in the work itself, not just its marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its merits, ``Cats'' was produced by individuals as an
original piece for the theater, while ``Lion King'' is but the
stage incarnation of an already existing product line (the movie,
the tchotchkes, the video, the Disney World representations, etc.)
manufactured by the most sophisticated entertainment giant on the
planet.
</P>
<P>
   The corporate mentality extends to the ``Lion King'' score,
which is by an assembly line of disparate songwriters (``Cats'' had
only Lloyd Webber and his unacknowledged alter ego, Puccini). The
performances at the New Amsterdam are often unspontaneous, as if
they were audio-animatronic carbons of the animated movie's
prototypes.
</P>
<P>
   There is synergistic cross-product-plugging not just in the
Disney store off the lobby but onstage (a gag promoting ``Beauty
and the Beast'').
</P>
<P>
   Disney is not alone in bringing a corporate approach to the
theater. It is merely the corporation with the biggest marquee
name, deepest pockets and, in truth, the most skill.
</P>
<P>
   A similar sensibility infuses ``Ragtime,'' the product of
Livent, the first publicly traded company to devote itself to
theater. Though based on a nuanced, indisputably adult novel by
E.L. Doctorow, this musical has the same look and feel as the
previous Livent product, ``Show Boat'' _ even though the shows have
different authors and were staged by very different directors
(Frank Galati and Harold Prince, respectively). ``Ragtime,'' like
``Lion King,'' comes to a halt for a gratuitous corporate plug (a
number about Ford Motor Co., whose cash donation bought it the name
of the new theater where the show is playing). And, like ``Lion
King'' as well, ``Ragtime'' is suffused with a bland political
correctness designed to appeal to all markets and offend no one.
(In retrospect, the vulgar sexism of ``Cats,'' with its
whore-kitty-with-a-heart-of-gold heroine, seems almost daring.)
</P>
<P>
   Since Disney still (rightly) regards theater as a small-potatoes
part of its empire, and Livent is on the ropes in the midst of
declining revenues and rising fraud investigations, they may
actually end up as relatively minor players in the new corporate
theater. The real power could turn out to be a newcomer few have
heard of: SFX Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The brainchild of radio mogul Robert F.X. Sillerman, the
publicly traded SFX has swallowed up a bevy of pop-music concert
presenters and venues, now controlling more than half the national
market, including 31 of the country's 37 amphitheaters.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, it bought Pace, the leading producer of
theatrical touring shows in the country, then went shopping for
other theatrical properties across the map. Since theater on the
road is now a far larger business than Broadway, SFX is de facto
the most powerful theater producer in the country.
</P>
<P>
   We have come a long way from impresarios like David Merrick and
Joseph Papp, who produced both high art and schlock but who
ventured from theater only to dabble in movies or television.
</P>
<P>
   SFX's nontheatrical enterprises include not just pop concerts
but the staging of monster-truck rallies, demolition derbies and
the career management of Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   On the new road dominated by SFX, not only are straight plays
extinct but even a Disney or Livent musical may prove to be a
relatively rarefied theatrical offering. Much of the schedule at
gargantuan touring houses around the country is filled out by what
Variety has called ``pseudo'' theatrical attractions: multiple
companies of ``Riverdance,'' ``Stomp,'' ``Tap Dogs'' and their many
imitators and variations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Broadway more than ever tailors itself to this same
huge and lucrative market. This explains not only why there are no
major American plays on Broadway's schedule this season but why
most of the announced shows are chestnuts with familiar, instantly
saleable titles (``Footloose,'' ``Peter Pan,'' ``Annie Get Your
Gun,'' ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown'').
</P>
<P>
   The only antidote to this new commercial theater, which has more
in common with the values of special-effects American movies and
network television than did even old Broadway at its most
commercial, remains the nonprofit theater of off-Broadway and
resident theaters nationwide. As has been true since the 1970s, the
most exciting new plays originate in such companies _ but now they
are ghettoized there.

 UNDATED: ghettoized there.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nonprofit theater hits like ``How I Learned to Drive,'' ``Wit''
and ``The Dying Gaul'' _ which once might have moved to Broadway
(and from there, possibly, to the road), as ``Glengarry Glen
Ross,'' ``Driving Miss Daisy'' and ``Angels in America'' once did _
now remain in small houses for their entire runs.
</P>
<P>
   An occasional ``Side Man'' notwithstanding, they rarely transfer
to Broadway and their only hope for national dissemination is if
they are mounted in new productions by local companies around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   On its face this seems a workable system: a two-tiered theater
just as there is a two-tiered film culture divided between
Hollywood blockbusters and independent art-house films. But
nonprofit theaters don't have the reach or the financial clout of
even the movie industry's small fry; the most successful of these
theaters still need serious philanthropic subsidies (public or
private) just to meet costs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the new corporate theater giants are knocking at their door
with bigger and bigger checks. This season alone three major
nonprofit theaters _ Lincoln Center Theater in New York (Livent's
``Parade''), the Alliance Theater in Atlanta (Disney's ``Elaborate
Lives: The Legend of Aida''), the Alley Theater in Houston
(SFX/Pace's ``Civil War'') _ are collaborating with the new
behemoths, exclusively on musicals.
</P>
<P>
   Are these Faustian bargains that will lead to other commercial
collaborations that will change the character of such theaters and
ultimately wipe tough new plays off their schedules, too? Or are
they benign, one-shot deals? It is too early to tell.
</P>
<P>
   An even larger open question is how corporate theater will
affect nonprofit theaters indirectly _ by shaping the taste of
their future audiences. If the new generations of theatergoers
coming up now are mostly weaned on the esthetics of ``Lion King''
and ``Riverdance,'' will they want the same limited theatrical diet
when they become the new audience pool for the Roundabout Theater
Company or the Goodman Theater in Chicago or Arena Stage in
Washington?
</P>
<P>
   A new Theater Development Fund survey released last month
reported the good news that the under-18 theater audience is
increasing for the first time in more than a generation. But there
is chilling news buried in the fine print: almost all of these new
theatergoers were attending ``Beauty and the Beast'' and the like,
with the under-18 component of straight-play audiences numbering a
minuscule 1.1 percent. (Even for 25-year-olds, the figure rises
only to 6.4.)
</P>
<P>
   But what keeps me optimistic about the theater, and always has,
is that the influx of talent never stops. If companies that were
vital when I was a drama critic, like the Circle Rep and Negro
Ensemble Company, vanish, new ones like the Atlantic, New York
Theater Workshop and Drama Dept. still come along to take their
place.
</P>
<P>
   These are the theaters that find and nurture the individual
voices that produce our best plays and musicals _ and they are the
antithesis of the new corporate theater, which is run by committee.
No corporation is ever going to create a ``Death of a Salesman'' or
a ``How I Learned to Drive `` or a ``Bring In da Noise'' or a
revival that makes you look at Shakespeare or Williams or Ibsen
anew. But will the nonprofit theaters that do this work be heard
against the forbidding din of giants like Disney and SFX and the
other media conglomerates certain to follow?
</P>
<P>
   At this point, as I recall, a drama critic ritualistically
reminds readers that the theater is a fabulous invalid, destined to
rise once more from its deathbed. But our theater, a bigger
business than ever as measured in dollars, is hardly dying. The
real question about a theater overrun by cartoon characters and
scripted by marketers is what, over the long haul, will be its
quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   I never would have guessed as I watched a defiant Joe Papp, the
great O'Neill actress Colleen Dewhurst beside him, fight big
commercial interests to save hallowed old playhouses in the early
1980s that his struggle was quixotic. Even if he had saved those
theaters, what would he have been saving them for? Not for the
theater of language and intimacy and passion. Not for anything he
or many of the rest of us back then would have recognized as plays.

`BELOVED': STAYING STUBBORNLY TRUE TO A WRITER'S VISION
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Oct. 18)  
(bl) 
 By WILL JOYNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Toni Morrison's novels have never been easy reading. Much like
the work of William Faulkner, another Nobel laureate, they tell
large, graphic, emotionally charged stories but do so with a level
of poetic language that fights against being understood too
quickly. They are full of vision about race and dominion in
America, but that vision is cumulative, even oblique, emerging only
in a slowly prevailing rhythm of words.
</P>
<P>
   How do you make a mainstream pack-'em-into-the-theaters movie
from ``Beloved,'' Ms. Morrison's 1987 novel about a former slave
named Sethe, whose endurance depends on her grappling with a
maturing flesh and blood daughter, Denver, and with the embodied
spirit of another daughter, Beloved, whom she long ago murdered out
of desperate devotion? Well, surprisingly and gratifyingly, you
don't.
</P>
<P>
   What is most impressive about the film version of ``Beloved''
that opened Friday is not that it simplifies Ms. Morrison's
difficult esthetic to attract a wider audience and become a
blockbuster in the process, but that it takes an opposite tack: It
stubbornly reinforces a literary way of looking at things, whereby
allusion counts for more than action or illusion, whereby fleeting
images _ a sprawling tree silhouetted against an evening sky, a
body hanging from a long branch in the light of a bonfire, a
treelike scar on a woman's back _ naturally enhance spare, almost
abstract dialogue about the weight of a horrific past. The film is
meant to appeal to serious readers and to seduce nonreaders.
</P>
<P>
   Although it comes to the screen heralded by solemn large-scale
advertisements and a welter of magazine covers featuring its
primary star and producer, Oprah Winfrey, ``Beloved'' turns out to
be that rare lushly photographed Hollywood movie that resists being
too accessible. This sweet irony can surely be attributed to the
skill, nerve, persistence and, yes, clout of Ms. Winfrey, who has
recently been the instigator of similar uncompromising literary
adaptations on television, and of Jonathan Demme. The director of
successes like ``The Silence of the Lambs'' and ``Philadelphia,''
he probably has the most to lose if this new film ends up being
considered an artistic failure.
</P>
<P>
   Which may well happen. It's telling that little of the early
Oscar talk about ``Beloved'' centers on the title character, played
in aggressively unsettling fashion by the British actress Thandie
Newton. Instead, the buzz seems to have settled more comfortably on
the performances of Ms. Winfrey, as Sethe; of Kimberly Elise, as
Denver, and of Danny Glover, as Paul D, a former slave who
rediscovers Sethe at the head of a troubled household outside
Cincinnati in 1873 and tries to help her imagine a future that's
not always shadowed by what Ms. Morrison calls ``rememory.''
</P>
<P>
   All these performances are worthy ones, and of a piece with the
movie as a whole, but they make up the more traditional, realistic
side of ``Beloved,'' the side that exists as a lyrical history of
institutionalized evil and the fight for freedom. It's the other
side _ represented by Ms. Newton's portrayal of the spirit child
who suddenly appears in the guise of an oddly well-dressed
teen-ager and works as a cosmic irritant on the souls of Denver,
Paul D and especially Sethe _ that gives Ms. Morrison's story its
dimension.
</P>
<P>
   Beloved is no ghost or angel in Hollywood terms: she's not
equipped with transparent wit, wings or the ability to treat the
living as bumbling chess pieces. She's more essence than being, a
frightening Old Testament-like force that whips up huge questions
of identity. She is both victim and antagonist. She is an aspect of
everyone around her. She has a feral kind of diction; she drools
and flails and eats like a wild animal. Most important, she is not
supposed to be completely understood _ by reader or viewer or
probably even author.
</P>
<P>
   Portraying Beloved, Ms. Newton took on a diffuse role that was
virtually impossible to get completely right, and many people will
be put off by the result. At one early screening several weeks ago,
more than a few viewers inappropriately laughed out loud at
Beloved's grotesque gestures and slurred speech.
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly a performance that can fairly be called
disturbing and over the top all at once, but in almost all of its
details Ms. Newton artfully followed descriptions in the novel (the
screenplay is largely true to Ms. Morrison's sentences), and it's
difficult to think of anyone who could have done better.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, though the Oscar nominations may go to Ms. Winfrey
and Glover, Ms. Newton plays just as large a part in giving
``Beloved'' its admirable against-the-grain texture. One hopes that
the movie will be used in high-school classes as Steven Spielberg's
``Amistad'' and ``The Color Purple'' have been.
</P>
<P>
   Discussions may prove inconclusive, but ``Beloved'' will impress
upon young people how the ravages of injustice can be addressed not
only in court cases and documented instances of personal courage
but also in the imperfect, unliteral contemplation of memory and
absences within an individual.
</P>
<P>
   Many moviegoers will recall that Ms. Winfrey and Glover also
appeared in ``The Color Purple,'' Spielberg's adaptation of the
Alice Walker novel about emotional warfare among a group of rural
blacks in the early 20th century. A look back at that accomplished,
if melodramatic, film illustrates just how different a Hollywood
vehicle ``Beloved'' is for the literary-cinematic consideration of
America's racial history, and perhaps how different 1998 is from
1985.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Color Purple,'' Glover is Mister, a self-centered man
who is especially cruel to the woman he should love the most; Ms.
Winfrey, making her feature film debut, is Sophia, a willful woman
who pays dearly for her self-respect. Both come across as versatile
actors who are able to swing between antics and dramatic effect.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Beloved,'' as Sethe and Paul D recall their lives as slaves
_ in searing, sepia-toned vignettes _ and then adjust what those
lives have become, Ms. Winfrey and Glover seem to have shed the
artifices of acting, stripping to a quiet, pure human center. From
vastly divergent directions, they evoke legitimate tears in both
films.
</P>
<P>
   The character in ``Beloved'' who will undoubtedly cause the most
tears, however, is Baby Suggs, Sethe's mother-in-law, who was
bought out of slavery by her enslaved son, Halle, and sent on to
Ohio, where she became a spiritual leader beyond sectarian
concerns, waiting for her kin to be free. Played wonderfully by
Beah Richards, Baby Suggs is a natural bridge between poetry and
history, literature and cinema, fiction and reality. In swirling
scenes that verge on the look of documentary, she preaches in a
forest clearing, intoning truths that have everything and nothing
to do with race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here in this here place, we flesh, flesh that weeps, laughs;
flesh that dances onbare feet in grass. Love it. Love it hard.
Yonder they do not love your flesh. They despise it. They don't
love your eyes, they'd just as soon pick 'em out. No more do they
love the skin on your back. Yonder they flay it. And O my people
they do not love your hands. Those they only use, tie, bind, chop
off and leave empty. Love your hands! Love them. Raise them up and
kiss them. Touch others with them, pat them together, stroke them
on your face 'cause they don't love that either. You got to love
it, you!''

SAN FRANCISCO CANDIDATE TAKES AIM AT MAYOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHUCK FINNIE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCSICO _ In a city where the dominant political
establishment revolves in tight orbit around one man, Board of
Supervisors candidate Rose Tsai is a runaway meteor.
</P>
<P>
   Tsai's bid for office takes aim at the man at the center, Mayor
Willie Brown, and her election would upset a City Hall where
loyalty to the mayor rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many issues that Rose and I agree and disagree on,''
said Angela Alioto, the former Board of Supervisors president and
two-time mayoral candidate. ``One thing about Rose is she is her
own conscience, and that is so important these days _ that she is
nobody's puppet.''
</P>
<P>
   Alioto, along with state Sen. Quentin Kopp and Supervisor Leland
Yee, are three prominent figures and Brown detractors who are
supporting Tsai's anti-Brown campaign for the board.
</P>
<P>
   Though she is not the only candidate being pitched to voters as
an independent voice in the Nov. 3 election for five seats on the
Board of Supervisors, Tsai stands apart in two regards:
</P>
<P>
   _ She is the lone challenger entered in the race with a solid
base of neighborhood support.
</P>
<P>
   _ Her candidacy, more than any other, gives the electorate a way
to vote against the mayor and what Tsai contends is Brown's
imperial way of governing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to call it a pro-democracy campaign,'' Tsai said,
whose views are slightly more conservative than many politicians in
this liberal city.
</P>
<P>
   Her campaign street signs make the message perfectly clear:
``She'll Stand Up To Willie Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   Tsai, 44, was born in Hong Kong and emigrated to New York at age
7. She moved to San Francisco in 1982 to attend Hastings College of
the Law.
</P>
<P>
   Tsai emerged publicly as a political force during the 1995
mayoral campaign when she helped pack a school auditorium with
opponents of a set of proposed, preservationist-inspired limits on
remodeling and expanding single-family homes.
</P>
<P>
   All five candidates for mayor, including Brown, left that
evening pledging to kill construction restrictions if elected.
</P>
<P>
   The homeowners, members of a group called the San Francisco
Neighbors Association, also became the core radio audience of a
Chinese language public affairs call-in show hosted by Tsai and
Julie Lee. Tsai and Lee, co-leaders of association, used the
program to inspire political activism and excoriate their foes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Tsai, Lee, and the Neighbors Association, then about
4,000-members strong, gathered signatures for a ballot measure to
retrofit and partially rebuild the elevated Central Freeway. The
measure, Proposition H, appalled the city's environmentally minded
activists and was resisted by the mayor and the county Democratic
Party apparatus. It won easily with 53 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't know that Rose has been active for years,''
said David Lee, director of the Chinese American Voter Education
Committee. ``Certainly planning commissioners did. But the Central
Freeway marked a turning point toward electoral politics as her
remedy of choice for problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The question for Tsai is whether the west- and south-side voters
who put Proposition H over the top _ voters in neighborhoods with
large or growing Chinese-American populations _ will turn out for
her Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Tsai said she learned from the Central Freeway issue to ignore
people when they say, ```Forget it, throw in the towel.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I proved them wrong,'' she said. ``I believe that if you are
right and truly you believe what you are doing is right, then you
should do everything possible to promote it. That is how we can
improve on society.''
</P>
<P>
   Her ideas include eliminating rent control on owner-occupied
buildings with four or fewer units, a proposal trounced at the
polls in June, and easing other city regulations on rental-property
owners and builders.
</P>
<P>
   Tsai also is at odds with legislation requiring city contractors
to provide benefits for registered domestic partners on a par with
those given to spouses of employees. She doesn't propose repealing
the ordinance, but said the city went too far in not exempting
social service agencies, like the Salvation Army, with religious
objections to the policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``To promote gay rights, do you have to shut down those
services, or can there be a compromise and things worked out?'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tsai's stances have won her the support of the county Republican
Party and the city's major restaurant and real estate associations.

CLIVE BARKER CREATES `LIVING MOVIE' FOR UNIVERSAL STUDIOS
</HEADLINE>
 
(Includes optional breakout box of upcoming appearances) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Clive Barker is at peace. No, not as in RIP.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few years, Barker had been uncomfortable being seen
as the ``horror guy,'' who is invited out at Halloween to comment
on the Dark Side. He felt remote from his earlier works, such as
``Books of Blood'' (1984), intense horror tales that Barker calls
``violent, visceral, erotic stuff.'' But these stories and his
``Hellraiser'' movies had made his reputation. And no less an
authority than Stephen King had christened him ``the future of
horror.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barker felt that he had grown as an artist and gone on to
other things, including his fantasy novels and his painting, and
bristled at being pigeonholed.
</P>
<P>
   Then last year, he attended a Halloween celebration and, well,
enjoyed himself. And Barker still seems to be enjoying himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's exactly right,'' he says with a laugh when it's
suggested that he's come to peace with himself and his image.
Though he still feels remote from the man who created ``Books of
Blood,'' Barker says, he has a new respect for the stories and for
his former self.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the man who created Pinhead, the urbane, spike-faced minion
of evil with a bloodlust for human souls from the ``Hellraiser''
movies, has turned his talents to creating a maze for Universal
Studios Hollywood, ``Halloween Horror Nights II,'' which will begin
Friday, to give fright fans their ``own private piece of horror
theater.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clive Barker's Freakz,'' which Universal is billing as a
``living movie,'' will use 35 actors, Barker says, and ``each
person will get a slightly different experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Barker says Universal was indulgent with him. ``They haven't
made me water anything down,'' and he wasn't obliged to use
Universal horror figures such as the Frankenstein monster, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 15 minutes into the meeting with Clive I knew we had the
right person,'' says Norm Kahn, vice president of entertainment at
Universal Studios Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understands how to build horror and tension.'' ``Freakz,''
says Kahn, is ``an assortment of horrific oddities that Clive has
gathered from around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Barker admits that creating the maze appeals to the
showman and voyeur in him, he also acknowledges the public's
craving to be frightened. ``If we gave them watered-down scare
they'd be angry,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something deeply perverse about this. If something
like this happened to us in real life _ a completely negative thing
_ we'd reject it wholesale. But if it's a safe environment, like a
movie or a ride or a book that we can put down, there's a very
strong public appetite for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Barker says that what he is doing with the maze is the same as
what King calls ``taking the reader into the morgue and feeling
beneath the sheets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What it is,'' Barker says, ``is a confrontation with death in
a very safe environment. If we walk away from the play environment
having confronted death ... then maybe we are stronger when we
confront it in the real world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all need to do this. We're all going to die.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day we talk, Barker is celebrating his 46th birthday, and
so maybe mortality is on his mind. ``The years tick on and you get
closer to the end,'' he philosophizes, ``and that's part of the
dynamic of being alive. Knowing we're on that journey.''
</P>
<P>
   He then points out how newspapers tell us every day that there
are innumerable ways we may not die peaceably, and that there is
this need in people to feel an adrenaline rush _ such as a near
miss on the highway _ that makes them feel more alive than they did
before it happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that goes again to why people need these kinds of
experiences (horror shows, etc.) in their lives,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But Barker is sounding very upbeat and alive this day, enjoying
a Havana cigar as he talks. And there isn't much time to be ``at
peace.'' Besides the horror maze, the Renaissance man has a list of
ongoing projects that would make the rest of us just tired from
looking at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clive is like David Bowie. He constantly reinvents himself,''
says Del Howison, the owner of Dark Delicacies, a horror book shop
in Burbank. ``I think that's almost for sanity reasons. ... When
you've accomplished something, why would you want to repeat
yourself? Clive constantly has broken new ground, whether it's his
artwork, writing or filmmaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Howison was hooked on Barker from his early books but has
watched the author expand his horizons, citing Jean Cocteau, the
French film director, as one of Barker's inspirations. ``Cocteau,''
Howison says, ``didn't limit himself to one thing, and Clive hasn't
done that, either.''
</P>
<P>
   If you doubt it, just look at what's on Barker's calendar. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Beginning Halloween eve at a Los Angeles-area gallery, an
exhibit of Barker's artwork, ``The Weird and the Wicked,'' goes on
display. He describes it as ``chiefly erotic work and some fantasy
stuff.'' Howison points out that Barker always has made himself
accessible to fans, and prices his artwork beginning at around $600
so it's not out of reach for his public.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's ``Gods and Monsters,'' which will be out in
November. The film, which Barker produced, deals with the life and
career of ``Frankenstein'' director James Whale. Directed by Bill
Condon (``Candyman Farewell to the Flesh''), ``Gods and Monsters,''
stars Sir Ian McKellan, Brendan Fraser and Lynn Redgrave, and has
been getting early raves.
</P>
<P>
   The energetic Barker hopes that ``Weaveworld,'' the miniseries
adaptation of his fantasy novel for Showtime, will go before the
cameras next spring. He's also developing ``Heretics,'' a TV series
for HBO that is described as being about America's dark secret
lineage.
</P>
<P>
   And he's still writing. In June, he released his 11th book,
``Galilee'' (HarperPrism), a novel he labeled ``a romance'' that
chronicles the interwoven histories of two powerful families, one
human and one divine. For next October, he is writing a collection
of short stories _ something he hasn't done since ``Books of
Blood'' _ that will contain both horror and fantasy tales. And then
two years down the road, there's ``The Book of Hours,'' which is 25
6,000-word stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything brings out a slightly different side to what I'm up
to,'' he says, quipping that all these projects keep him off the
streets, which means he's busy coming up with new adrenaline rushes
for his fans.
</P>
<P>
   So, what scares the man who scares us?
</P>
<P>
   Barker admits to a fear of ``airplanes, elevators, anything
that's claustrophobic.'' Seeing a couple of his friends committed
to mental institutions and going to visit them made him feel
uneasy. It's that ``fear that we might be perceived as crazy or
that we are crazy and don't know it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Anything else?
</P>
<P>
   ``Running out of Havanas,'' he says, laughing.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Universal Studios, which was once the fright king
with films such as ``Frankenstein'' and ``Dracula,'' wants to
reclaim its role as leader in horror, says Norm Kahn, vice
president of entertainment at Universal Studios Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a corporate priority,'' he says, citing not only the
Halloween extravaganzas at the theme parks here and in Florida but
upcoming films such as ``Bride of Chucky,'' ``Psycho'' (by the way,
you can see the film's trailer before it hits theaters on the
Internet at www.psychomovie.com) and the recently announced
``Untitled Frankenstein CGI Project,'' which is a full-length
all-digital computer-generated film.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that priority, Kahn says, is to build up attendance at
the theme parks during off-peak times. Acknowledging that it faces
tough competition from Knott's Berry Farm, Universal hopes that
``Halloween Horror Nights'' becomes an annual draw.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn says that along with ``Clive Barker's Freakz'' maze this
year there will be three other mazes _ the sci-fi based ``Alien
Assault!''; the ``Crypt Keeper's Screaming Room,'' which is a
tribute to modern horror; and ``Classic Creature Features,''
spotlighting Universal monsters such as Frankenstein, Dracula, the
Wolfman and the Mummy.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the park's usual attractions will take on a Halloween
theme, too. ``Waterworld'' will become ``Slaughterworld,'' and
there will be an ``Animal House of Horror.'' There also will be a
Kiss tribute band performing at the Beetlejuice Rockin' Graveyard
Revue and a host of ``scaracters'' roaming the park.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's ``Halloween Horror Nights II'' runs three
consecutive weekends beginning this Friday and Saturday and running
Oct. 23-24 and Oct. 29-31. It will be open 7 p.m. to midnight
Thursdays and 7 p.m. to 1 a.m. Fridays and Saturdays. Tickets are
$24 in advance, $34 at the gate. For information, call (818)
622-3801.  &QL;

   NBC got some punishing news for its first big movie project of
the season, an adaptation of the Dostoyevsky classic ``Crime and
Punishment,'' which drew ratings so frigid that the network may
send several of the other literary works on its development list to
Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   The movie was crushed on Sunday night, finishing last among
programs on four networks. It fared particularly poorly against the
CBS movie ``Marriage of Convenience.'' That movie, about a couple
who marry to be parents for a dead sister's son, more than doubled
the NBC rating for ``Crime and Punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Crime and Punishment'' had a 6.1 rating, while ``Marriage of
Convenience'' was a 14.5. Each rating point represents 994,000
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very disappointing morning around here,'' said Lindy
DeKoven, the executive in charge of NBC's movies. ``We knew it was
a particularly difficult classic for television. But I think the
audience was clearly sending us a message. The audience said they
prefer the CBS movie, which was really a far more traditional kind
of television movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeKoven had led the effort at NBC to bring literary classics
to television and turn them, though big-name casting and aggressive
promotion, into events. The strategy worked brilliantly with such
fare as ``The Odyssey'' ``Gulliver's Travels'' and the legend of
Camelot packaged in ``Merlin.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the wake of Sunday's lugubrious results, Ms. DeKoven
said, ``We probably will re-evaluate some of the literary projects
we have in development here.'' She did not specify which projects
might be affected but said they would not include several other
classic-type movies in the works for this season, like ``Alice in
Wonderland'' and ``Noah's Ark.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed for a reason why ``Crime and Punishment'' fell so short
of NBC's hopes, Ms. DeKoven said she believed the national mood was
not right for a movie with a setting or theme so serious and heavy.
``We commit to these two years out,'' she said. ``Now we have the
collapse of the Russian economy in the news. The realism in the
movie was obviously very difficult.''

</P>
<P>
   Nobody is laughing at the Fox network _ both on the air and in
its office suites. Four of the five live-action comedies on Fox's
schedule drew anemic ratings and Fox's patience ran out quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The network has taken a meat ax to its comedy lineup, knocking
the four comedies off the air. Tuesday, ``Holding the Baby'' was
the latest to make the hit list (that's hit as the Mafia, not
Nielsen, defines it). On Monday, Fox dropped both its Friday
comedies, ``Living in Captivity'' and ``Getting Personal.'' Last
week ``Costello'' was the first show on any network canceled this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting Personal'' is the only one of the three comedies
bounced this week to get an official cancellation notice. The other
two will stay in production, though Fox had no idea when they would
return. No other network has removed shows from its schedule this
season.
</P>
<P>
   The moves leave only ``That 70's Show'' in the crop of
live-action comedies on Fox's schedule as it heads into the
November sweep month in just a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Fox will replace the Friday comedies by rearranging its plans
for a drama series called ``Brimstone,'' originally set for Tuesday
nights at 9. Fox will now run the show on Friday nights at 8,
starting on Oct. 23. The network has ordered new episodes of its
summer series ``Guinness Book of World Records'' to fill the spot
on Tuesday nights at 9.
</P>
<P>
   Fox will count on football overruns and perhaps some double
episodes of its Sunday series ``World's Funniest'' to fill the gap
left on Sunday by the shelving of ``Holding the Baby.''
</P>

   ASCENDING ABC
</P>
<P>
   At least one network had something to smile about in the weekly
ratings: ABC saw some promise in its improvement in many areas from
a week earlier and the network has moved into a solid second place
behind NBC in the category of viewers between ages 18 and 49 that
ABC considers its measuring stick.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly ABC is pleased that it has patched up what had been
disastrous nights on Thursday and Saturday and has gotten solid
performances out of such holdover series as ``Home Improvement,''
``Spin City'' and ``The Practice,'' while hoping some new shows
like ``The Hughleys'' and ``Sports Night'' will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel really upbeat about the first three weeks,'' said Stu
Bloomberg, chairman of ABC Entertainment. ``We were so close to NBC
in the 18-to-49 group last week.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC had a 5.9 rating among that age group last week compared
with a 5.5 for ABC. CBS had a 3.9 and Fox a 3.5. (Each rating point
represents 994,000 homes.)
</P>
<P>
   ABC was extremely pleased to be well ahead of Fox, which has
beaten ABC in that category two years in a row, leading to much
teeth gnashing at ABC and its parent, the Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   Before the season began, Bloomberg predicted that ABC would
improve its overall ratings after several seasons of steep
declines. So far, ABC is down, not up, for the season, though in
half of the hours on the schedule it has improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think our new shows are better this year,'' Bloomberg
said. ``I still think we have a good chance to improve overall by
the end of the season.''

   A CALL FOR DECENCY
</P>
<P>
   Is television leading children down a moral sewer? Steve Allen
thinks so, and his name and photograph have appeared in full-page
newspaper advertisements _ one ran Tuesday in The New York Times _
asking people to send money to a conservative media advocacy group
that is urging advertisers ``to stop sponsoring sex, filth,
violence and sleaze.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you fed up with steamy unmarried sex situations, filthy
jokes, perversion, vulgarity, foul language, violence, killings,
etc.?'' the ad asks. It also argues that television violence causes
real violence and that television sex encourages teen-agers to have
sex.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, the comedian and former television talk show host, has
joined actress Shirley Jones as a co-chairman of the Parents
Television Council, the Los Angeles arm of the Media Research
Council, which is based in Alexandria, Va., and whose chairman is
L. Brent Bozell III.
</P>
<P>
   In the ad, Allen asks people to send in a coupon so that the
council can tell advertisers how many people want them to ``bring
back family-safe TV,'' and to contribute money for more ads.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign began with $500,000 donated by a retired
advertising executive who wishes to remain anonymous, said Mark
Honig, executive director of the Parents Television Council. Ads
have appeared in about 50 newspapers, and the group has placed
orders with a total of 119.
</P>
<P>
   But advertisers are more concerned about reaching a particular
age group than with placing their ads in specific shows, said
Andrew Schwartzman, executive director of the Media Access Project
in Washington. ``Sponsors want a certain demographic and they leave
it to the ad agencies' computer models to pick where their ads
go,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Valenti, head of the Motion Picture Association of America
and an architect of the year-old television content ratings system,
applauded Allen's concern but criticized his contention that
television shows cause criminal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homicide rates and crime generally have been going down for
the last three or four years, especially in big cities,'' he said.
``Should television get the credit for that, too?''
</P>
<P>
   Allen was on a plane Tuesday afternoon and could not be reached
for comment.

 &HT;    COLUMN: My mistake was pointing out his mistake
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   My dog Kazan has been house-broken almost as long as I can
remember. But the other morning, he fell from grace.
</P>
<P>
   When I went downstairs to let him out, I saw it wasn't soon
enough. He had made a puddle in the living room. I shouted, I
scolded, I upbraided and berated. A soon as I opened the door, he
was gone. He dashed out into the darkness and didn't return.
</P>
<P>
   When I had finished with the mop and made my first cup of
coffee, I began to regret my hasty tirade. After all, he is an old
dog and generally well-behaved. He sleeps on a bathmat at the foot
of my bed, and when I move around the house and yard, he's my
shadow, taking every step I take. Most of the time he asks to go
out and he asks to come in, and when I talk to him, he sits still
and listens, which is more than my own children are famous for.
</P>
<P>
   If Pavarotti were a dog, he would sound like Kazan. A voice of
such range, such volume. It's said that he has an Eskimo in his
background. The dog, not the tenor. (I never question the lineage
of anybody, man or beast, that I'm fond of.)
</P>
<P>
   But he does lift his muzzle and howl on occasion, and it is pure
Jack London and the frozen north.
</P>
<P>
   I thought of all this as I waited for his return. Finally, when
there was no summons to the back door, I took the flashlight and
set out to look. The sun was still missing from our sky; the birds
were still silent.
</P>
<P>
   I heard a neighbor's dog in the distance, but I didn't hear
Kazan. I called. (He doesn't always answer. I think his hearing is
impaired.) I flashed the light under shrubs and down the driveway.
He is very fond of my daughter and her children, and if I'm not at
home on a stormy day, he seeks refuge from thunder in their house
next door. So I visited them, flashing my light under their front
steps where he has been known to sleep on a hot afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   No Kazan. I went back in the house and got another cup of coffee
and repented of my nasty temper.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody who would scold such a fine friend doesn't deserve his
bright-eyed attention, his big paw on her knee, his false but
impressive effort to repel all suspicious visitors. My coffee
didn't taste like anything. I put the cup in the sink and picked up
the flashlight again.
</P>
<P>
   This time I tried the dirt road in front of the cabin. He was
run over there once, and I think he doesn't spend time on the road
any more unless one of us takes him walking. But I flashed my light
and called. He came out of the bushes, his big plum tail at full
mast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kazan, come on home,'' I pleaded. ``I'm sorry I scolded you.
You are a good dog.''
</P>
<P>
   He acted as if he didn't hear me. He trotted to the other side
of the yard out of range of my light. But then he turned, and when
I opened the screened door to the porch he deigned to enter. He did
not, however, have any interest in my apologies.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a good day. I groveled. Kazan pouted. I fed him and
refilled his water bowl. He wasn't grateful.
</P>
<P>
   Only when my granddaughter Betsy came over and rubbed his ears
and scratched his back and discussed the life of a dog and a little
girl in comparable terms did his long doggish face lighten up.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon, when I settled in the swing with a book, he
came and lay down nearby, sighing heavily. I think I'm forgiven.

 &HT;    Home furnishings take on latest accent
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you think exotic getaways are only for the rich and famous,
think again.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture manufacturers are designing pieces inspired by places
they hope will take you, vicariously, around the world. And they're
hoping to make the trip more enticing by attaching celebrity names
to their products _ a trend among the thousands of manufacturers
that show their newest pieces each spring and fall at the world's
largest furniture trade exposition in High Point, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing the essence of world travel ... as a big
influence on home furnishings with a blend of exotic and tropical
themes and motifs,'' said Mark McMenamin, merchandising and
business editor for Home Accents Today, a trade publication. ``What
that looks like is a setting in which the traveler has kept all his
prized possessions from his travels.''
</P>
<P>
   Think Ernest Hemingway. When the weeklong fall market opens
Thursday, Thomasville Furniture Industries and other manufacturers
will introduce a collection of 96 pieces inspired by places where
the famed author lived or worked _ Kenya, Key West, Ketchum and
Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Think merry old England. Artist Thomas Kinkade has teamed with
La-Z-Boy to create a line of furnishings with images of his
landscape paintings emblazoned on everything from lampshades to
upholstery. ``One thing we'll see at this market is a resurgence of
the English country cottage look,'' McMenamin said.
</P>
<P>
   Think golf outings. The Professional Golfers Association and
Vanguard Furniture, in one of the more unusual licensing
agreements, will present PGA Tour, a collection inspired by ``the
casually elegant decor of upscale resorts and the finest old
country clubs,'' its promotions claim.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the lines introduced this fall (and expected in stores
by spring) reflect the increasingly popular strategy of
``branding'' _ linking a famous name or trademark to a product to
give it a sense of value.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Mackie, the Hollywood costume designer, will unveil a
collection of Louis XV-style furnishings for Ladd Furniture Co.
Manufacturer John Widdicomb will be showing reproductions of pieces
in London's famed Victoria and Albert Museum. Even trends guru
Faith Popcorn, who coined the term ``cocooning'' in the '80s and
will speak at Thursday's press breakfast, is about to launch the
Faith Popcorn Cocooning collection with BarcaLounger. It will
include a recliner with features for nursing mothers and
aromatherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have many heroes today, as the millennium
approaches,'' Marla Metzner, who created the Hemingway brand, told
The New York Times. ``We're going back to the great icons of the
century, as heroic brands.''
</P>
<P>
   Hang onto your luggage, furniture buyers. It could be quite a
trip.

 &HT;    HALLOWEEN IS HAUNTINGLY ENTICING AS THE CITY BY THE SEA GOES
SPECTRAL
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL OCTOBER 18: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla._A persistent early evening drizzle enshrouds
the nation's oldest city. Menacing gray clouds hang heavily above.
Rain-drenched sidewalks, glistening under the soft glow of
streetlights, are all but empty. Attractions and shops that lure
tourists by day are locked for the night.
</P>
<P>
   All is quiet near the City Gate _ built in 1739 as the only
entrance to the then-walled settlement _ except for the sound of a
bluesy guitar at the Milltops, a tavern upstairs at the Old Grist
Mill with its landmark water wheel. Nearby, a few brave souls
huddle under umbrellas, waiting for the ``Ghostly Experience''
walking tour to commence. Dampened by the rain, we follow our
guide, Stephanie Kent, into the night.
</P>
<P>
   We splash across St. George Street, dodging puddles as we head
toward the shadowy Catholic Tolomato Cemetery on Cordova Street.
It's an eerily appropriate spot to begin with a chilling tale.
</P>
<P>
   A young wife who had died of a severe illness was being carried
to her grave _ sitting upright in a chair, as was the custom of the
time, her head nodding back and forth from the motion. Suddenly,
the story goes, she was cut in the temple by a thorny branch and
began to ... bleed. When a friend thought he saw her blink, she was
returned home where she recovered and lived six more years. When
she died again, her husband warned the pallbearers to steer clear
of the offending tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a zillion stories in St. Augustine,'' says native
Sandy Craig, who ought to know. A descendent of one of the city's
oldest families, the Solanas, she started the ``Ghostly
Experience'' tours in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Tales of the supernatural take our imaginations on phantasmic
flights from the sturdy coquina fortress of Castillo de San Marcos
downtown to the black-and-white striped lighthouse across Matanzas
Bay on Anastasia Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``These stories are true stories,'' says the harmonica-playing
guide Tommy Ray Bledsoe as he begins another tour through the dark
streets, lantern in hand. ``But even though they're all true
doesn't mean they're all factual.''
</P>
<P>
   Believe 'em or not, the legends make for great entertainment.
And the visitor in search of haunted history can get an earful _ if
not an eyeful. On a recent visit, we collected ghost tales like
souvenirs, but left without encountering a single spirit of the
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the restless ones are waiting around to make their grand
re-appearances during the Halloween celebration Oct. 30-31. The
family-friendly party has been dubbed ``Old Haunts in the Old
City.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything old is revered here: There's the Old Market at the
Plaza, the Oldest House, the Oldest Wooden School House, the Oldest
Drugstore, the Oldest Store Museum, the Authentic Old Jail.
Overnight guests can stay at the Old City House Inn. Oh, and don't
forget the Ancient City Baptist Church and the Ancient Cab Co.
</P>
<P>
   Just what you'd expect to find in the oldest permanently
occupied European settlement in the United States, founded by
Spanish explorer Pedro Menendez de Aviles in 1565 on land occupied
by the Timucuan Indians. In more than four centuries, the city has
weathered periods of Spanish, English and U.S. rule, flourishing in
the late 1800s when oil millionaire Henry Flager built elegant
hotels and churches to create what he envisioned as an American
Riviera.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's remarkable what this town has been through,'' says Tony
Kuykendall of Louisville, Ky., as he examines a patinated bronze
cannon on the gun deck of the Castillo de San Marco. ``It's not
surprising there'd be a few ghosts.''
</P>
<P>
   A few, indeed. Every building in town, it seems, has a resident
ghost (or ghosts). And almost everyone you meet has a spooky story.
</P>
<P>
   Esther Aikens, who runs the Gatekeeper gift shop, recalls an
unsettling experience when she was tour guide at the DeMesa-Sanchez
House, built about 1760 and now furnished to reflect the
comfortable lifestyle of a St. Augustine family in the American
Territorial Period (1821-1845).
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the one who locked up,'' she recalls, ``and I made sure
everything was in its place. The next morning when I came in, a
little tea set had been moved.'' Another time, she and an
accompanying group of tourists heard a piano playing _ but no else
was in the house.
</P>
<P>
   One theory about the ghost suggests it could be a Native
American boy whose grave was disturbed when the house was built.
But Aikens thinks the spirit is probably a daughter of the Loring
family that lived there in the 1830s. The child drowned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was quite interesting and curious,'' Aikens says.
``That set me to find out more about that house. That's the fun of
St. Augustine _ there's so much history to explore and research.
The things I've heard over the years have made me believe these
stories are authentic.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, the dark tales give this historic town an appeal
that's at once magical and romantic. Maybe that's why even the
dearly departed simply refuse to leave.

 &HT;    Cronkite and Glenn team up again for live space coverage
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Glenn isn't the only object of nostalgia associated with
NASA's Oct. 29 space mission, when the first man in space becomes,
at 77, the oldest man in space.
</P>
<P>
   CNN viewers will experience another deja vu when Walter
Cronkite, 81, co-anchors the cable news network's live coverage,
with Miles O'Brien, from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
Cronkite was virtually the voice America's space heyday, including
Glenn's 1962 Earth orbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my first opportunity to do a live broadcast in many
years,'' says Cronkite, who last called a launch in 1991. ``It's
exciting to all of us (at CNN), and to the public as well. (It
will) remind the public that we're still in space. The flights of
the shuttle have become so routine, we've really almost lost track.
This is a good opportunity to remind the public and educate a new
generation about what we're doing in space.''
</P>
<P>
   Cronkite spoke to reporters on Tuesday from New York about the
coverage of Glenn and his mission. Here are some excerpts:
</P>
<P>
   -- On the recent death of CNN correspondent John Holliman, who
was scheduled to co-anchor with Cronkite, and to whom CNN is
dedicating its coverage: ``I was seriously affected by the death of
John Holliman. I had many meetings with him by telephone, and then
I met him the Wednesday before the Saturday he was so tragically
taken from us. I understood at that meeting why he was so beloved
at CNN. He was an extrordinary personality.''
</P>
<P>
   -- On covering the launch for CNN instead of CBS, for whom he
has worked for 49 years: ``Since (CNN newsgroup chairman) Tom
Johnson came to me with the proposition, I asked CBS whether they
had plans to cover the mission live. I thought they did not (CBS
will cover the 2 p.m. launch live from 1:30 to 2:30 p.m.) and they
released me to do this with CNN. Since CNN was the only operation
going live with a full day's broadcasting, this was obviously a
great place to be.''
</P>
<P>
   -- On whether he's sorry he's not the one being sent into space:
``Of course. I'm delighted (Glenn) is getting the flight _ he's the
qualified one. But as I told him in a phone call, I told him it's
most unfair. I'm older than he is, and if they want to test old age
in space, I'm the one to send up there.''
</P>
<P>
   -- On whether he views Glenn's launch as a publicity stunt by
NASA: ``I reject (that). NASA obviously is excited with the
publicity. But they took this suggestion after two years of study
... and certified it as a legitimate mission. An astronaut ... at
the age of 77, who would be willing to go through all this rigorous
training _ it's not child's play. This is not a vacation trip by
John Glenn in any manner. I don't see how it can be called a
publicity stunt.''
</P>
<P>
   -- On his impressions of Glenn when he first met him in the '50s
and '60s: ``John always seemed more serious about the mission than
the other (early astronauts). It was the way he tackled everything
in life. There was a little bit of a feeling among the rest that
John was kind of a boy scout about the thing; he chastised them
when he thought they weren't taking it seriously enough.''
</P>
<P>
   -- His impressions of Glenn now: ``Nothing's changed.''
</P>
<P>

   Kaufman doing fine
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Atlanta TV anchor Monica Kaufman has received the best
possible news following her breast cancer lumpectomy Friday at
Emory University Hospital. Kaufman told WSB-TV that her doctors
have said the tumor was extremely small, that it had not spread,
and that radiation will not be necessary. ``This excellent result
came from the power of prayer,'' Kaufman was quoted as saying in a
memo posted at WSB, thanking the staff for their prayers.
</P>
<P>
   WSB general manager Greg Stone said Kaufman will probably return
to her anchor seat next week, tentatively on Monday.
</P>

   Everything basic with MTV show
</P>
<P>
   MTV's new ``Revue'' (10:30 EDT tonight) is basically an artist
talking to a camera.
</P>
<P>
   No interviewer. No studio audience. Not interested? Well, the
first artist is rapper/singer Lauryn Hill, arguably the most
talented member of rap act The Fugees, so this simple program's
debut registers higher than your basic TV fare.
</P>
<P>
   Since its release six weeks ago, Hill's solo debut ``The
Miseducation of Lauryn Hill'' has held Top 10 positions on
Billboards's R&AMP;B and pop album charts. She's been on the cover of
seemingly every magazine but because Hill released her album way
into her pregnancy, she's been avoiding TV.
</P>
<P>
   No problem. ``Revue'' shoots from the waist up as the
25-year-old weaves bits of her life story around selections from
``Miseducation.'' The music is the much better part.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a response to her long-rumored troubles with fellow
Fugees Wyclef Jean and Pras, we get what it was like when they
first met. (``(Pras) was very suave for high school.. . . Clef was
whoo!''). While the single Hill talks about her first child Zion,
she relates nothing about his father. And even when it seems like
she just might open up _ ``I was going in a direction that wasn't
healthy for me,'' she says of her life before children _ there are
no details about that ``direction.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no follow-up question. After all, there's no
interviewer. Makes you miss Kurt Loder a little bit.

 &HT;    'Rice eel' may threaten Everglades soon, biologists say
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Walking catfish, take a hike. A
yard-long, sex-changing, air-breathing eel may take the crown as
the weirdest foreign fish ever to invade South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian swamp eel also may pose one of the greatest threats
ever to the Everglades, federal biologists say.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that tens of thousands of
the nocturnal carnivores are lurking in canals along the border of
Broward and Miami-Dade counties.
</P>
<P>
   Though nobody has found the eels in the Everglades, scientists
say they see little to stop them from spreading through the
region's maze of canals.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, they could drive out native species while devouring
the crawfish, frogs and small fish that wading birds need for food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida has a lot of exotic fishes,'' USGS biologist Leo Nico
said. ``But unfortunately, I think this is one of the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the walking catfish, the eel can breathe air. It can
migrate over land, slithering as fast as a snake between waterways
hundreds of yards apart, Nico said.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike most of South Florida's foreign fish, which mostly
stick to canals, this one likes marshes, said Jim Williams, a
researcher at the agency's Florida Caribbean Science Center in
Gainesville. In its native Asia it thrives in rice paddies, giving
it the nickname ``rice eel.''
</P>
<P>
   It also tolerates cold weather and has been spotted as far north
as Atlanta. It's versatile, too, often starting out life as female
before swapping genders.
</P>
<P>
   But Paul Shafland, an administrator at a state exotic-fish lab
in Boca Raton, cautioned against panic. He said the walking catfish
spawned all sorts of spurious rumors after it arrived here from
Thailand in the 1960s, including news reports claiming that it
climbed trees and attacked dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned,'' said Shafland, a biological administrator
for the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission. But he said
scientists don't know yet whether the eel will prove a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   For the record: Scientists have no reports of the eels attacking
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've handled several hundred eels, and they never show
aggression to humans,'' Nico said. Instead, they use their slimy
bodies to slither away.
</P>
<P>
   The eel joins an estimated 28 foreign fish species thriving in
South Florida _ including various catfish, tilapias, gouramies, the
pike killifish, cichlids, guppies and carps. Even piranhas have
turned up from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   The eel appeared in late 1997 in two spots across the state:
south of Tampa Bay and in the Snake Creek Canal near Pro Player
Stadium. Since then, the USGS has found the eels in the canal from
east of Interstate 95 to as far west as U.S. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists suspect that people who own aquariums dumped the eels
in the wild. Now, they may be here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   One solution to other foreign fish problems _ using chemical
poisons against sea lampreys in the Great Lakes _ is unlikely in
canals that help supply South Florida's drinking water, Nico said.
</P>
<P>
   He said scientists have used a boat equipped with electrodes to
shock the water, stunning the eels before scooping them with a net.
But that method can't catch them all, and the inches-long babies
can be small enough to slip through the mesh.
</P>
<P>
   Alligators, birds and water snakes probably will eat the eels,
Nico said. But the eels might prove too elusive to catch, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible solution: plain old human appetite.
</P>
<P>
   Daryl Roche of Fort Lauderdale, an activist with the Native Fish
Conservancy, has posted a recipe on the Internet for Asian swamp
eel _ marinated and fried. He says it can be ``served over cold
pasta and garnished with fresh chopped tomato and a sprig of
rosemary.''

 &HT;    Most of Florida's political soft money comes from capital
 &HT;    By Shirish Date
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE _ The state capital is not among Florida's largest
cities, but it is easily the most generous to politicians looking
for money.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one in every nine dollars given to either Democratic or
Republican parties _ so-called soft-money, because there are no
limits on how much can be given _ comes from just three of the
state's 1,500 zip codes: downtown Tallahassee, home to a couple of
thousand legislative and executive branch lobbyists, according to a
Palm Beach Post analysis of contribution records.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't surprise me at all,'' said Sally Spener,
executive director of Common Cause of Florida, a group that has
long pushed more stringent limits on campaign contributions. ``The
lobbyists, the special interests, are in Tallahassee.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the $29.8 million taken in by the two parties as of Sept. 24,
almost $3.4 million, or 11 percent, comes from the three
Tallahassee zip codes surrounding the state Capitol: 32301, 32302
and 32399.
</P>
<P>
   The three codes ranked one, two and three as Democratic donors
and one, two and five for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, donations to the two candidates for governor _
which are limited to $500 per individual or corporation _ from the
three zip codes are much more in line with those of other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay received $82,940 from the 32302
area code in the capital, his best territory for fund raising but
only about $30,000 more than what he raised in Miami's 33131 zip
code, his next highest contributor base.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Jeb Bush, a Miami developer, raised $47,963 from
Tallahassee's 32301, but that zip code ranked 18th on Bush's list.
First for Bush was 33134 in Coconut Grove, which raised $136,801.
Miami's 33131 also came in second for Bush, which gave him $132,290
_ more than 2 1/2 times what it gave MacKay.
</P>
<P>
   Between the two candidates, Tallahassee's downtown zip codes
account for only 1.8 percent of the $9.9 million the two men have
raised.
</P>
<P>
   It is the unregulated, ``soft-money'' donations to the parties
that show the abuse of the system, critics like Spener believe,
especially since lobbyists are expected to make campaign
contributions just as they are expected to pay their phone bills or
rents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a cost of doing business,'' Spener said, adding that
although donations are not tax deductible business expenses,
ultimately it is the clients who pay for the donations through the
lobbyists' fees.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most generous lobbyists, Aventura's Ron Book, said he
gives money because, as with any job, he has grown closest to those
people he must deal with every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call it a cost of doing business, call it anything you want,''
said Book, who counts Wayne Huizenga and many south Florida cities
among his clients. ``To me it's helping your friends.''
</P>
<P>
   So far this election cycle, Book has contributed $107,240 to
various campaigns. That includes $44,490 to the state Republican
Party and $6,000 to the state Democratic Party. His wife, Patricia,
has donated another $46,750, according to state Division of
Election records.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time you can help people the most is during their
campaigns,'' he said.

   While businesses donate indirectly through their lobbyists, they
also can donate directly through their executives and the
corporation itself _ sometimes creating interesting contrasts.
</P>
<P>
   The 33440 zip code in Clewiston, for instance, is not generally
regarded as a well-to-do area. But it is the corporate home to U.S.
Sugar, which put the zip code in the No. 16 spot for Republican
Party donations statewide with $145,410. That ranked above 34103 in
Naples, 33426 in Boynton Beach and 33133 in Coconut Grove.
</P>
<P>
   The Clewiston zip code also gave $19,735 directly to Bush and
$31,130 to the Democratic Party. In contrast, MacKay, a staunch
supporter of a failed constitutional amendment to tax sugar to pay
for Everglades restoration, received but $75.

 &HT;    UT student enrollment again highest in nation
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Sitting in a state that's big on being big, the
University of Texas is the nation's biggest university for the
second year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   With 48,917 full- and part-time students this fall, UT has more
student bodies than its closest rival, Ohio State University, which
counted 48,169 last Friday. Head counts at both schools will change
before they become final later this month, but Ohio State officials
said Monday they won't fluctuate nearly enough to close a
748-student gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're safe in saying UT is the largest,'' said Gail
Stephenoff, an assistant in the office of enrollment management.
</P>
<P>
   UT officials aren't crowing, however. They had hoped to fall
below last year's enrollment of 48,857 and get closer to their
ideal head count: 48,000, said James Vick, vice president for
student affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a love-hate relationship,'' Vick said. ``It's nice to
have something where you're No. 1, . . . but when you're recruiting
students, often they may have resistance to a large school.''
</P>
<P>
   UT officials said the campus was coping well with the influx.
Many services are now computerized, eliminating long lines for such
things as financial aid and schedule changes.
</P>
<P>
   But lots of students still mean big classes, and high
student-faculty ratios have caused UT to suffer in quality
rankings. Most big schools around the nation said they have taken
pains to shrink.
</P>
<P>
   UT had as many as 50,245 students in 1989 and brought the
numbers down to 47,905 in 1995. They crept back up, however,
propelling UT to its No. 1 status last fall. Ohio State last year
had 48,278 students.
</P>
<P>
   Although UT hoped to enroll a much smaller freshman class this
year, it ended up with 6,744, just 341 fewer than last fall.
</P>
<P>
   It will take time to get smaller, Vick said, adding, ``It's a
little bit like turning a battleship around.''

   KOSOVO-ACCORD (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ The U.S. special envoy
Richard Holbrooke announces an agreement that averts the immediate
threat of NATO air strikes against Serbia and addresses measures
that could lead to a form of autonomy in Kosovo Province. By Jane
Perlez.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-ASSESS (Brussels, Belgium) _ Through forceful if belated
diplomacy, the Clinton administration has won enormous concessions
from the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic. But the agreement
on Kosovo seems fraught with the dangers that have long bedevilled
the West in Bosnia. A news analysis by Roger Cohen.
</P>

   CONGRESS-IMF (Washington) _ The Treasury Department and
congressional Republicans hammer out final details of compromise
legislation to provide $18 billion to the International Monetary
Fund in exchange for new restrictions on its ability to lend to
foreign governments. By Philip Shenon.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-CLINTON (Broomfield, Colo.) _ While the election in
three weeks has been portrayed in Washington as a referendum on
whether President Clinton should be impeached, the scandal has not
become a central part of the discourse _ or the candidates'
strategies _ in the closest House and Senate contests in the
country. By Richard L. Berke. 1,500 words.
</P>
<P>
   TRAILER-GIRL (Dixon, Ill.) _ Watching classmates strut past in
designer clothes, Wendy Williams sat silently on the yellow school
bus, wearing a cheap belt and rummage-sale slacks. One boy stopped
and yanked his thumb, demanding her seat. ``Move it, trailer
girl,'' he sneered. It has never been easy to live on the wrong
side of the tracks. But in the economically robust 1990s, with
sprawling new houses and three-car garages sprouting like
cornstalks on the Midwestern prairie, the sting that comes with
scarcity gets rubbed with an extra bit of salt. By Dirk Johnson.
With photos. 1,600 words.

   GAZA-INDUSTRIAL-PARK (Gaza City, Gaza Strip) _ The grandly named
Gaza Industrial Estate, hailed by all sides as the first tangible
achievement of the current phase of the tortuous
Israeli-Palestinian negotiating process, is expected to be
operating before the end of the year. It will employ up to a
thousand Palestinians in several small-scale manufacturing
ventures. It is a measure of the Gaza Strip's isolation and
economic desperation that this tentative, modest project looms so
large for Palestinian planners. By William A. Orme Jr. 1,200 words.
</P>
<P>
   MERRILL-CUTBACK (New York) _ Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the first big
American financial firm to announce cutbacks in response to the
world's troubled financial markets, says it will eliminate about
3,400 jobs, or just more than 5 percent of its work force. By Peter
Truell. With graphic.

 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ From the towering bubble-gum-pink wigs in the new
opening number to the three-way sword fight in the new finale,
Broadway's troubled musical, ``The Scarlet Pimpernel,'' has
undergone a major overhaul, noteworthy not only for its breadth but
also for who is behind it.
</P>
<P>
   The musical, based on the 1905 novel by Baroness Orczy, had been
foundering. Critics dismissed the show, about an English aristocrat
who rescues victims from the Reign of Terror after the French
Revolution, as campy when it opened in November 1997. By this
spring, the 1,700-seat Minskoff Theater was less than half full,
and in its worst weeks the show was losing an estimated $50,000 to
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   But the people who did go kept giving standing ovations, and one
of those people was Madison Square Garden president and chief
executive David Checketts, who saw ``Pimpernel'' several times and
felt it deserved to continue. So Checketts decided to do something
about it: buy the show, fix it and try to make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Madison Square Garden's parent, Cablevision Systems
Corp., announced that its Radio City Entertainment division was
acquiring ``The Scarlet Pimpernel'' in a joint venture with
financier Theodore Forstmann, who is one of the show's original
producers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to saving a show he believed in, Checketts said, he
thought the investment would pay off, that Cablevision could market
the show more effectively on television and, if it proved
successful, start several road companies around the country.
</P>
<P>
   For a company like Cablevision, the ``Pimpernel'' deal is small
potatoes. The company and Forstmann each put up about $1 million
for the refurbishment, according to one person who is working on
the new production. No cash, stock or debt was exchanged in the
``Pimpernel'' deal. Cablevision assumed financial responsibility
for the musical and obtained all the rights to it.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, although Broadway shows are always a roll of the dice,
Checketts seemed unfazed by the odds. ``When you start talking
about businesses that have risks _ the New York Knicks, the New
York Rangers _ we're kind of used to that,'' Checketts said. ``I
don't see this as very risky.''
</P>
<P>
   Checketts also said his company wanted to break into Broadway,
beyond the three live entertainment shows it already produces in
New York: ``A Christmas Carol,'' ``The Wizard of Oz'' and the
``Radio City Christmas Spectacular.''
</P>
<P>
   Radio City is already one of the producers on the new Broadway
musical ``Footloose,'' which opens at the Richard Rodgers Theater
this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our business is live events, and Broadway is an extension of
that,'' Checketts said. ``We're going to develop more and more live
products, particularly products that we can take out of town,
because we think Middle America loves Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 1 the curtain came down on the final performance of the
old ``Pimpernel.'' The show was dark for eight days while the cast
rehearsed. And Saturday afternoon, the curtain rose on the new
``Pimpernel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We bought the show; it belongs to us,'' Checketts said. ``From
the day we closed the show, we could do anything we wanted, subject
to the creative team.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the highly unusual nature of this arrangement, theater
veterans are skeptical. ``It's always a long shot that you can redo
a musical that's already been seen by so many people,'' said Rocco
Landesman, president of Jujamcyn Theaters. ``But you have to admire
the belief in the project. And if it helps the show have a longer
life, I'm all for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it will remains to be seen. Songs and scenes have been
cut and new ones added. There are new costumes and new sets. And
although Douglas Sills has stayed on in his Tony-nominated role as
the Pimpernel, Rex Smith and Rachel York have taken over the other
two leading roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no scene that stayed exactly as it was,'' said Nan
Knighton, who wrote the book and lyrics. ``There are only a couple
of songs that have remained completely untouched.''
</P>
<P>
   One would expect considerable creative tension when a
corporation comes in and takes over. But the writers and actors in
``Pimpernel'' say they view Cablevision as nothing short of a
knight in shining armor; the show's days were clearly numbered.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Ms. Knighton said, she was the one who originally
turned to Forstmann for help in financing a television commercial
as a last-ditch effort when it looked as if the ``Pimpernel'' was
doomed. ``We reached a point where we knew we would have to close
the show down,'' Ms. Knighton said.
</P>
<P>
   Forstmann hooked up with Checketts, and the two men realized
that they agreed on two things: the show was worth saving and it
needed work. What the show lacked, the businessmen determined, was
a consistent tone, clearer plot and character development and _
perhaps most important _ more aggressive marketing.
</P>
<P>
   In marketing, Checketts felt Radio City Entertainment had a lot
to offer, given its ability to promote its projects on cable
television and its success with sports events and concerts and more
recently with theater at Madison Square Garden, Radio City Music
Hall and the Theater at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   As for Forstmann, he said turning around troubled businesses is
what he does for a living _ why not a Broadway show? His leveraged
buyout company, Forstmann Little &AMP; Co., has reversed the fortunes
of companies like the Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. and Dr
Pepper/Seven-Up Cos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conceptually, this is not foreign to me at all,'' Forstmann
said. ``Let's say a company has a good product and there's
something wrong. So you step in and you try to fix it. Here I
wouldn't have put my money into it to begin with if I hadn't
thought the idea was great.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, now that Forstmann is in deep, he said he was
eager to see the ``Pimpernel'' pay off. If it does, the original
producers stand to benefit as well. In addition to Forstmann, they
include Pierre Cossette, Bill Haber, Hallmark Entertainment and
Kathleen Raitt. ``Our investors are now in a position to get their
money returned,'' Cossette said. ``This is terrific for all.''
</P>
<P>
   In remaking the show, the new producers turned to Tim Hawkins,
the senior vice president of Radio City Entertainment who became an
executive producer on ``Pimpernel,'' and to Robert Longbottom, who
became the show's director and choreographer, replacing Peter Hunt,
the original director, and Adam Pelty, the original choreographer.
Longbottom has directed the ``Radio City Christmas Spectacular''
for four years and he directed ``Sideshow'' on Broadway last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Longbottom said he had tried to emphasize the heroic aspect of
the play. ``We've focused on the adventure of this and what it
means to get involved, what ultimately will push our buttons to
take a stand,'' he said. ``That's the part that really spoke to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The producers replaced two of the leads, Christine Andreas and
Terrence Mann, ostensibly because of scheduling conflicts. In
August Ms. Andreas told Playbill Online: ``The producers have come
in with new ideas about the role of Marguerite that don't include
me. And that is fine.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Before going forward, Checketts said, he and Forstmann met with
Sills and made sure he would stay with the show. ``I said, `We
don't want to be in the rowboat alone,''' Checketts said. ``He's
got such great energy and leadership, I don't think we could have
done it without him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sills said their commitment was compelling: ``I think that is
the future of Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   Radio City did some market research _ focus groups and phone
surveys _ and found that a key problem with the show was that the
general public did not know what it was about. ``The challenge was,
how do you change a communications strategy about a show so this
time people understand what it is you're doing?'' Checketts said.
``You can't call it, `Scarlet Pimpernel II,' but it is a different
show.''
</P>
<P>
   They enlisted the advertising agency Kirshenbaum Bond &AMP;
Partners, which developed the ``Broadway's Most Intriguing
Musical'' campaign for the show that is already blanketing
billboards and television. A sample: ``Blackmail. Murder.
Seduction. Bring Your Mother!''
</P>
<P>
   The play's creative people say they are grateful for the rare
opportunity to improve on their mistakes in real life, rather than
merely in retrospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unfortunate that we never got the chance to have an
out-of-town gig and had to open cold in New York,'' said Frank
Wildhorn, the composer. ``It's great now to take the knowledge
learned from the audience and apply that.''
</P>
<P>
   As the anchor of the show (he's onstage almost constantly),
Sills faced perhaps the most challenging transition. In September,
he was rehearsing the new version of ``Pimpernel'' during the day
and performing the old version at night. There were some close
calls. One evening, for example, he momentarily forgot the words to
the song ``The Creation of Man,'' which has been moved from the
start to the end of the first act. ``It was panic city for the
first 10 seconds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest risk lies with ``the suits'' who have
gambled on saving a struggling show. But at the moment, they sound
pretty confident. ``If we're right and the music is good and the
thing really works and people like what we think they like, this is
going to be a big success,'' Forstmann said. ``If we're wrong, it
isn't. We will not be wrong.''

CONGRESS-LIMBO (Washington) - Arizona's congressional delegation is

110) and border-crossing cards (Section 104) - are under intense

COCKFIGHT (Dewey, Ariz.) - Dale Dunivin got a little misty-eyed as
he remembered the first time he hauled his fighting cock, Ol' Blue,
to the pits in Quartzsite three years ago. Seems that Ol' Blue was
paying way too much attention to loving and not enough to fighting,
when a rather effeminate-looking ``henny cock'' took to the center
of the ring. ``He thought he had himself a new girlfriend,''
Dunivin said. ``But that other cock got on top of him and cut down
through his back, cutting his ribs loose. ``We thought we were
going to lose him.'' But Ol' Blue rallied, put some moves on his
foe, and managed to dig his spurs into the heart of the other fowl.
It was all over but the shouting as the bleeding bird slumped to

COCKFIGHT-PROP (Undated) - Trailing in the polls, Arizona
cockfighters are huddling behind a ``Mt. Rushmore defense'' against
a proposed ban on their sport. Presidents Washington, Jefferson,
Jackson and Lincoln all were cockfighters, David Harris says in a
publicity pamphlet for the Nov. 3 general election. Proposition 201
would be a slap in the face of the nation's founders, Harris, a
cockfighter, claims. A check with historical agencies in the home
states of all four presidents found no chicken blood in the
background of Jefferson or Lincoln. But Washington and Jackson were
another matter. Washington's correspondence mentions that the
future president attended a cockfight when he was 19. And
cockfighting was only the least scurrilous of the accusations
hurled against Jackson in the 1828 presidential campaign. In his
defense, Jackson scrawled in a handwritten message that he had not
been to a match ``for the last 13 years.'' By MIKE MCCLOY. Story

SNOWBIRDS-ARIZONA (Undated) - This time of year, Joe Stofsick, 76,
and his bridge pals at Leisure World in Mesa can usually count on

rolling in for the season. The annual welcome back party for
thenortherners is planned for Oct. 19, but Joe and his neighbors
areconcerned that most the seats reserved for the Canadians will be
empty. The Canadian dollar, now worth just under 64 U.S. cents, is
causing some Canadians to cancel or shorten their U.S. winter
visits. The number of winter visitors in Arizona declined 6 percent
last season_ the first drop since the recession of the early 1990s.
Arizona rankssecond only to Florida as a winter destination for
retirees. Other forces may be at work besides Canadian exchange
rate and health policy. Arizona's strong economy, for example, is

 &HT;    GOP WATCHING NORTH CAROLINA RACE FOR CLUES ON 'CLINTON FACTOR'
 &HT;    600&AMP;add. With CLINTON-VICTORY.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ The ``mess in Washington'' is an unwelcome
guest in this year's congressional elections, even for a Republican
like Dan Page, who has spurned the advice of national GOP leaders
and has turned his campaign into a referendum on impeaching
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Political strategists have been watching Page's race since
August, when he became the first Republican to run TV ads tying his
Democratic opponent to Clinton's moral failings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Applauding Clinton's values, not ours,'' trumpeted the ad,
which featured a photo of the president and incumbent Rep. Bob
Etheridge standing together. Etheridge was outraged.
</P>
<P>
   But Page has maintained an almost daily drumbeat of baiting
Etheridge to act ``responsibly'' and join him in demanding
Clinton's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Less than three weeks before a general election which may decide
the fate of Clinton's presidency, few Republicans elsewhere seem to
be following Page's example.
</P>
<P>
   Only 11 Republicans and 4 Democrats have made any reference to
Clinton's troubles in their advertising since Page's in August,
according to calculations by The Hotline, an electronic political
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Just weeks ago, Clinton's troubles seemed likely to drag
Democrats to large House losses and below 40 seats in the Senate,
sapping their power to filibuster bills they oppose. But now,
analysts wonder if an anti-impeachment backlash is rising.
</P>
<P>
   A Washington Post poll published Monday found that the
Republican-held Congress has lost support among likely voters since
last week's largely partisan vote in the House to begin a formal
impeachment investigation of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   According to the poll, the proportion of likely voters who say
they intend to vote for the Republican House candidate dropped from
47 percent to 42 percent during the past two weeks. Democratic
support increased from 47 to 51 percent in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   With such a volatile electorate, the analysts say, candidates in
close races are largely avoiding the impeachment topic, although
some who trail badly are using it to draw attention to their
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders are continuing to advise candidates to let the
scandal simmer on its own without stirring it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our folks out there have a great story to tell the American
people,'' said House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas, citing
the party's role in balancing the federal budget, cutting taxes and
reforming welfare.
</P>
<P>
   In such uncertain times, both parties have reverted to what they
know best: Democrats are promoting Social Security and education,
and Republicans are advocating tax cuts and smaller government.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do what people perceive you are best at,'' said Mike
Davis, a longtime Democratic political consultant in Raleigh, the
state capital, who is advising the Etheridge campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear, however, that on the day after the Nov. 3 election,
the Republican leadership of Congress will dissect the results in
the Page-Etheridge race before deciding how far to proceed in their
inquiry on whether to impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a district that is going to send a message to the
president and to the Republican Party,'' said Jack Hawke, a veteran
of Republican political wars in the South going back to Barry
Goldwater's presidential campaign in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Hawke said Republicans intend to express their anger not only
with Clinton's extramarital relationship with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky, but also their disappointment in the GOP
congressional leadership for ``not doing enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis insisted the election is still issue-driven, which should
benefit Democrats. ``But if Bob Etheridge loses by 10 or 15 points,
the president is in serious trouble,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina's 2nd Congressional District, which includes
parts of Raleigh and nine small farming and manufacturing towns
like this one in the northeastern part of the state, is a swing
district. In 1994, it elected a conservative Republican, David
Funderburk. In 1996, it was carried by Etheridge and Democratic
Gov. Jim Hunt, but ticket-splitters also favored Republican Sen.
Jesse Helms, and 52 percent of its vote went to the GOP
presidential candidate, Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Smith, a retiree and longtime resident of Rocky Mount, is
typical of the district's voters. She identifies herself as a
Democrat, but admits voting Republican occasionally. And like so
many others here, she is fed up with ``that mess in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What the president did was repulsive,'' she said. ``But what
the Republicans are doing is repulsive, too. The president didn't
hurt the government. He hurt his family. But the Republicans won't
get on with what's important to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawke, a former state GOP chairman who is an unofficial adviser
to Page's campaign, acknowledged that the Clinton scandal, once a
clear advantage to the GOP, has shifted enough that Republicans
throughout the country are fearful of a voter backlash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House strategists are brilliant,'' said Hawke.
``They've made it look like people are fed up with it and
Republicans are going too far. So nobody wants to get involved.
Republicans are always complaining that the White House pays too
much attention to polls. But I think that maybe the Republican
leadership is paying too much attention to polls right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republican pollster Bill McInturff predicted that polls are
going to ``snap back in a Republican direction'' in the coming
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And Democrats, who earlier this year entertained the prospect of
reclaiming the House from the GOP, are fanning backlash sentiments
just to hold their own.

 &HT;    IN IMPEACHMENT CONTEXT, WHAT IS ELECTORAL VICTORY OR DEFEAT?
 &HT;    With CLINTON-POLITICS.
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Measuring victory or loss for President Clinton in
the upcoming general election is no mere matter of tallying up the
number of elected and defeated Democrats. It's more a matter of
exceeding or falling below expectations.
</P>
<P>
   New York Times columnist William Safire tried to ``lowball''
Clinton this week in a column suggesting that any increase of
Republican seats in the House would be a mandate for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But that ignores historic trends that work against all incumbent
presidents. In this century, the party that controls the White
House has lost an average of 29 House seats in elections taking
place during their sixth year of control.
</P>
<P>
   Some have predicted that if the Democrats can do better than
this historical average, Republicans will feel pressure to
negotiate a Clinton punishment of censure or another sanction
rather than impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if House Democrats gain 11 seats, they will control
the new Congress in January. But hardly anyone expects that result.
</P>
<P>
   In an uncertain political climate, some Democrats are boldly
predicting they'll gain a few seats, while some Republicans foresee
picking up scores.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., chairman of the National Republican
Campaign Committee, said recently that the GOP could add 10 to 15
seats to its current majority.
</P>
<P>
   Any Republican gain of less than this level would be viewed by
some political analysts _ and certainly by the White House _ as a
Republican loss that could slow the momentum toward impeachment.

ARCADI VOLODOS: SHADES OF HOROWITZ, BUT AN INDIVIDUAL IN THE
MAKING 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Oct. 18) 
(JT) 
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When you next go hiking in the hills outside Madrid,
you might come across a stocky young man with thick, wavy hair,
very Russian-looking, very polite, and never know that inside his
head he was considering how to phrase and shade the melody in a
piece by Schumann; how to render the shape of a Schubert sonata, or
how to bestow counterpoints on something by Glinka to create a
fantastical variation.
</P>
<P>
   This pianist in the open air would be Arcadi Volodos, who
astonished an audience at Avery Fisher Hall in February when he
played Rachmaninoff's Third Concerto and his own exuberantly
festooned version of Mozart's ``Turkish'' Rondo, and who plays a
solo program of Schumann, Liszt and Russian music on Wednesday
evening at Carnegie Hall. The Russian pieces, he says, balance
``exaltation and darkness,'' consisting of some late Scriabin, ``a
music of insects in the forest,'' and four of Rachmaninoff's
``Etudes-Tableaux,'' all somber and in the minor mode.
</P>
<P>
   Volodos' extraordinary technique _ a matter not only of speed
(though the velocity of his right hand is amazing) but also of
color, textural clarity and, especially, consistently singing tone
_ fits him for the Everests of the piano repertory. And indeed, his
first recording, made in 1996 for Sony Classical, begins with a
reinterpretation of Horowitz's dazzling memento of ``Carmen.''
</P>
<P>
   But he denies he is a specialist in virtuosity. In his New York
hotel room, recently, he spoke with quiet passion about a vast
range of piano music, from Mozart concertos and Schubert sonatas
(evidently a great love) to works of Messiaen. The piano's whole
literature, it seems, is a country he has surveyed, and he likes
the look of most of it. Now 26, he could go in almost any
direction.
</P>
<P>
   That he has reached this position of authority at such a young
age is a tribute to his intellectual powers, and is all the more
remarkable given that he began serious study of the piano only 10
years ago. He had the advantage of being born into a musical
family: his father is a professional operatic baritone, and his
mother is also a singer. Maybe some singing genes have come down
into his fingertips, but if so, it took him a while to discover
them there. As a boy at the leading music school in Leningrad, he
wanted to be a conductor and took the piano only as a secondary
study. When, at 16, he decided to devote himself to the instrument,
he was, bewilderingly, refused entry to the piano department of the
Leningrad Conservatory.
</P>
<P>
   Leningrad, he reasonably concluded, was not for him. He went to
Moscow and, at the conservatory there, became a pupil of Galina
Eguizarova. ``She was not a piano teacher but a great musician who
could see far into the future of her pupils,'' Volodos said. His
musical relationship with her was very close, and it was decisive.
He was already familiar with recordings by some of the gods of the
piano: Rachmaninoff, Cortot, Gieseking and Schnabel are the first
names he mentions, and after them, the great Russians of the
midcentury, like Samuel Feinberg, Vladimir Sofronitsky and Maria
Yudina. With Ms. Eguizarova as his mentor, these exemplars became
his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 21, he left Russia for Paris, where he studied for a
year with Jacques Rouvier. Then he went to Madrid, following his
Venezuelan girlfriend, though it must have helped that in the
Spanish capital he would be able to resume contact with Ms.
Eguiza-rova, who was by then teaching at the Queen Sofia Music
Academy. There he also took lessons with Dmitri Bashkirov. And
there he has stayed, living in an isolated house in the country,
where he can enjoy, he says, silence and solitude, and the chance
to work on his music away from the piano.
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, when he was 23, he had come to the attention of
Jean-Hugues Allard, Sony's executive vice president for classical
music, who brought him together with Thomas Frost, the producer of
many of the recordings Horowitz made from 1962 on.
</P>
<P>
   Here was a crucial test. At their first encounter, Volodos dared
to play Horowitz's ``Carmen'' showpiece, which he had memorized by
listening intently to Horowitz's 1968 recording, overseen by Frost.
The producer was impressed, not only by the young pianist's
resemblance to Horowitz in his extreme skill and expressive
spontaneity but also by the differences. This was not a Horowitz
sound-alike but an artist with his own ideas. Volodos' first
recording duly followed, with Frost producing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the most talented young pianist I've seen in many
years,'' Frost said recently. ``He has everything: imagination,
color, passion and a phenomenal technique to carry out his ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   The CD demonstrates a spectacular technical mastery, of course,
but also a musicianship that has been widely and justly praised.
Amid the fireworks come more reflective items _ two Rachmaninoff
songs transcribed by Volodos, a Bach slow movement adapted by
Feinberg _ that bring out the pianist's melodic fluency, his use of
color to define counterpoint and his generous warmth of tone,
together with a rhythmic solidity that marks him out as something
other than the ``old-fashioned virtuoso'' of publicity releases.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Volodos is determinedly his own man. Only his repertory might be
called old-fashioned, though he responds vigorously to such an
accusation. ``All music is contemporary,'' he said. ``If music
interests me, it is of the present. There is no such thing as dead
music.'' And the music that interests him is by no means all from
the main virtuoso track: his first London recital, in 1996,
included an early, unfinished Schubert sonata, and the Schumann in
his Carnegie Hall program is the underplayed ``Bunte Blatter.''
</P>
<P>
   When invited to talk more particularly about his musical
preferences, aims and hopes, he becomes reticent, repeating the
sage old formula that ``where words end, music begins.'' But he is
firm and eloquent about the kind of preparation he does, which is
exhaustive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am studying a Schubert sonata, I need to hear all the
sonatas, the songs, the quartets, in order to discover the
composer's thought,'' he said. ``To study just one `Etude-Tableau'
of Rachmaninoff, for example, would be absurd.'' And indeed, his
Rachmaninoff performances seem to be informed by a knowledge of the
songs, of how, as it were, the composer sang.
</P>
<P>
   His seriousness about breadth of awareness _ revealed also in
how he plays concertos, looking with close attention at his
partners in the orchestra, responding to them _ provides one reason
for his contempt for competitions, in which superficial performers
can often get by very well. ``In music there are no winners and
losers,'' he said. ``The whole idea is ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he is clearly one of the music world's winners at the
moment, and he may well remain so if he can preserve his feeling of
responsibility. ``For me to play at Carnegie Hall is not
important,'' he said. ``My success with the audience is not
important. What matters is whether Schumann and Scriabin have a
success. This is music that has been in existence for many years,
played by great musicians. What is my success?''

 &HT;    IN IMPEACHMENT CONTEXT, WHAT IS ELECTORAL VICTORY OR DEFEAT?
 &HT;    With CLINTON-POLITICS.
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Measuring victory or loss for President Clinton in
the upcoming general election is no mere matter of tallying up the
number of elected and defeated Democrats. It's more a matter of
exceeding or falling below expectations.
</P>
<P>
   New York Times columnist William Safire tried to ``lowball''
Clinton this week in a column suggesting that any increase of
Republican seats in the House would be a mandate for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But that ignores historic trends that work against all incumbent
presidents. In this century, the party that controls the White
House has lost an average of 29 House seats in elections taking
place during their sixth year of control.
</P>
<P>
   Some have predicted that if the Democrats can do better than
this historical average, Republicans will feel pressure to
negotiate a Clinton punishment of censure or another sanction
rather than impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if House Democrats gain 11 seats, they will control
the new Congress in January. But hardly anyone expects that result.
</P>
<P>
   In an uncertain political climate, some Democrats are boldly
predicting they'll gain a few seats, while some Republicans foresee
picking up scores.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., chairman of the National Republican
Campaign Committee, said recently that the GOP could add 10 to 15
seats to its current majority.
</P>
<P>
   Any Republican gain of less than this level would be viewed by
some political analysts _ and certainly by the White House _ as a
Republican loss that could slow the momentum toward impeachment.

NEXT CALIFORNIA LEADER MAY HAVE TO GRAPPLE WITH GAY MARRIAGE
ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Although Republican Dan Lungren and
Democrat Gray Davis don't talk about it unless asked, gay marriages
will be one of the issues facing the next governor.
</P>
<P>
   The state may soon be forced to decide if marriage licenses
issued to gay couples in Hawaii should be legal in California, too.
And supporters of an initiative to outlaw gay marriages have
submitted signatures to qualify for the June 2000 ballot _ ensuring
a divisive debate during the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond marriages, the next governor must make important
decisions on a variety of issues the gay community cares about _
issues such as financing a $52 million AIDS-drug program, allowing
gays to adopt children and legalizing domestic partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   The gay-rights community is universally supporting Davis, the
current lieutenant governor, over Lungren, the state's attorney
general. But many had supported financier Al Checchi and Rep. Jane
Harman in the Democratic primary, mainly because they were viewed
as taking more committed gay-friendly stands. Davis, who supports
domestic partnerships and civil rights protections, said he
wouldn't sign a gay-marriage bill ``because I don't think America
is yet ready for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lungren is staunchly opposed to gay marriages, even citing the
Seventh Commandment on adultery in one legal argument. And he went
out of his way to support a Colorado initiative barring local
anti-discrimination laws for gays. But he supports expanding
public-private partnerships to house AIDS patients, and he opposed
an effort to ban gays from public classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Gay-rights and conservative groups believe the Nov. 3 election
is crucial, particularly if the Legislature remains controlled by
the Democrats. A poll released Monday by the Public Policy
Institute of California showed Davis favored by 49 percent of those
surveyed compared with 41 percent for Lungren and 9 percent
undecided. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 2
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative groups say 16 years of Republican governors have
helped stop the ``homosexual agenda.'' Gov. Pete Wilson, who cannot
seek re-election, vetoed every domestic partnership and gay civil
rights measure sent to him last year, saying existing
anti-discrimination laws were adequate.
</P>
<P>
   Gay-rights groups say a Democratic governor would improve the
civil rights laws and expand benefits for gay families.
</P>
<P>
   Davis as governor ``would be a challenge,'' said Lou Sheldon
with the Anaheim-based Traditional Values Coalition. ``I'm not
going to brush that one off. We'd have to prepare ourselves for a
huge onslaught.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years ago this month, California became the first state to
sanction inter-racial marriages. Activists say California faces
another historic moment soon, depending on how its leaders act on a
pending Hawaii Supreme Court case regarding two men fighting for a
marriage license there.
</P>
<P>
   A 1977 California law defines marriages as ``a personal relation
... between a man and a woman.'' But the U.S. Constitution requires
states to give ``full faith and credit'' to the laws of other
states, just as California accepts marriages between cousins in
some Southern states. The Hawaii decision could mean thousands of
gay California couples getting married on the islands, and
returning with a license.

 &HT;    AIR STRIKES AVERTED - FOR NOW, PROBLEMS REMAIN IN KOSOVO
 &HT;    With BOSNIA-STRIKES-1014.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. pilots, diplomats and military observers will
begin moving this week into positions to help monitor a Serb
military pullback in Kosovo, but President Clinton warned TUESDAY
that the threat of NATO air strikes will hang over Belgrade until
Serbs have ended their campaign of repression and terror against
Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   While pledges by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic have
averted NATO airstrikes for now, Clinton stressed that the United
States and its allies would rely on an ''intrusive'' verification
regime -- some 2,000 observers on the ground supported by military
surveillance aircraft in the skies -- to determine whether the
Serbs live up to their word.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be facts, facts on the ground, which will tell us
whether or not the compliance is there,'' Clinton told reporters on
the South Lawn of the White House. ''I certainly would hope that
this NATO position will, in effect, be maintained until all the
conditions are fully met, and I expect that it will be.''
</P>
<P>
   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, has given
Milosevic until Friday night to comply with a Monday agreement
concerning Kosovo or face the prospect of air strikes carried out
by a massive, U.S.-led force.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments made clear that he favors retaining the
threat of NATO force for the foreseeable future, as the
verification team moves into place to monitor Serb actions on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the verification regime were still being hammered out
as of late Tuesday, the day after Milosevic agreed to pare back
military and other security forces in the southern province of
Kosovo and enter into talks centered on Kosovar autonomy in
exchange for a reprieve from a threatened NATO attack.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the United States and three dozen other
members of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) will provide some 2,000 observers who will go unarmed into
Kosovo and fan out across the province to verify Serb compliance
with Monday's accord. It wasn't known how many of the observers
would be Americans, though several administration sources suggested
it would be at least several dozen.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic also agreed to enter into negotiations -- by early
next month -- over a path toward autonomy for Kosovo. Nine in ten
residents of the province, part of Yugoslavia, are ethnic
Albanians. Since 1989, however, the province has been governed by
ethnic Serbs, under a series of decrees and legislation ushered
through by Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke brokered Monday's accord with an
eye toward three basic goals:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  end Serb violence that has led to the deaths of hundreds of
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ensure the safety of an estimated 300,000 Albanians that have
fled their homes so that they might return before winter takes a
grisly humanitarian toll;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  and set up negotiations between the government of Serb
nationalist Milosevic and the Kosovars aimed at returning to the
Albanian majority some measure of control over the institutions of
provincial government -- chiefly, the police, judiciary, schools
and local administrative organs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea here is you have a verification mission in place to
provide confidence and security to the people of Kosovo that they
can get the food they need, they will not be subject to police
intimidation, that they can come back to their homes ... pending a
political settlement,'' said U.S. State Department spokesman James
Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   Fully staffing and deploying the observer mission could take
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers, however, were expected to begin moving within
days, likely beginning with a doubling and reactivation of the much
smaller Kosovo Diplomatic Observers Mission, or KDOM, that had been
operating in Kosovo under the auspices of NATO and the OSCE. The
KDOM team, roughly 50 observers, had recently moved out of Kosovo
due to escalating violence and the prospect of a possible NATO
attack, but was expected to return within days.
</P>
<P>
   Observers on the ground will be assisted by NATO aircraft,
including U.S. planes, flying over Kosovo on surveillance missions.
No NATO warplanes are envisioned for the mission, though the
Pentagon suggested that combat aircraft would be available to
support the reconnaissance planes if they came under threat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll leave it to NATO to figure out whether they want to
disclose how they're going to handle the protection of those
flights,'' Pentagon spokesman Cpt. Michael Doubleday told
reporters. ''There are plenty of aircraft to take any steps that
NATO commanders feel are necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the risk to NATO pilots, air defense systems operated
by the Yugoslav military will be moved out of Kosovo or placed
under the observation of international monitors. In addition,
Yugoslav combat aircraft will not be permitted to fly in the
vicinity of NATO surveillance aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Doubleday said NATO would have ''unrestricted access'' to the
airspace above Kosovo, but would file advance flight plans with
Yugoslav officials ''up to several days in advance,'' of NATO
flights.
</P>
<P>
   ''But if it becomes necessary, because of weather or other
considerations, to set up one of these flights on a very rapid
basis, it could be done with as little as an hour's notice,''
Doubleday told reporters during a Pentagon briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were quick to point out potential flaws in Monday's
accord and the plans for verifying Serb compliance with it.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, while Monday's agreement calls for Milosevic to
pull back thousands of troops and police, some backed with armor
and heavy artillery, from Kosovo, it allows him to maintain
thousands more who were already in the area before he unleashed an
aggressive campaign of terror last February upon the ethnic
Albanian Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're still going to be at the mercy of Serbian force,''
said Kurt Bassuener, associate director of the Balkan Action
Council, a non-profit research outfit here.
</P>
<P>
   Bassuener also fears that unarmed observers on the ground in
Kosovo might be used as human shields by Serbs should NATO threaten
future strikes. Similar concerns were an impediment to NATO strikes
against Serbs during three and a half years of fighting in
neighboring Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ''These people,'' in Kosovo, ''could have the same effect,''
Bassuener said.
</P>
<P>
   To anticipate that problem, NATO will set up a rapid reaction
force just outside of Kosovo -- possibly in nearby Macedonia, where
a U.S. military observer mission has been stationed for several
years -- that would have the capability to conduct combat rescue
missions on short notice.
</P>
<P>
   And, while U.S. officials declined to publicly discuss the
prospect of observers being used as human shields, one White House
official said privately that ''It would be a gross
miscalculation,'' for Serbs to threaten observers, adding that
''any punitive response would be decisive.''

JUDY GARLAND: A BUNDLE OF EMOTION FROM ``MISS SHOW BUSINESS'' 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Oct. 18) 
(JT) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pure feeling. Judy Garland didn't just deliver it when she sang,
she embodied it, no matter how ragged her voice or how histrionic
her delivery. The sound of that much emotion so densely
concentrated wasn't always easy to take. Like no other American
singer, Garland erased the line between laughter and tears,
suggesting a barely suppressed hysteria with each gasp and
choked-up cry.
</P>
<P>
   Edith Piaf, who was seven years Garland's senior, also delivered
pure feeling, but it was harsher, even sadder, and more
animalistic. Even so, Garland, who conveyed the same mixture of
wracked fragility and resilience, was America's answer to the
Parisian legend. Both women were tiny, explosive and
self-destructive, dying at 47 yet paradoxically coming to symbolize
survival over terrible odds.

from her 1963-64 television variety show, Garland's recorded legacy
was scattered among several different labels. This set, produced by
Joel Dorn and his son, Adam, with the Garland archivist Scott
Schechter, encompasses the breadth of Garland's recording career,
from an early 1929 recording of the 7-year-old vaudevillian through
a stunning, stripped-to-the-bone 1969 concert performance of ``Over
the Rainbow,'' recorded in London five months before her death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judy'' goes out of its way to intersperse familiar songs with
fascinating esoterica and previously unheard concert performances.
Her version of ``Over the Rainbow'' in ``The Wizard of Oz,'' for
instance, is prefaced with a dramatic re-creation made for radio of
the composer Harold Arlen ``teaching'' Garland the song, which he
sings in a sweet cantorial tenor.
</P>
<P>
   By 1946, Garland's wistful lost-little-girl sound had ripened
into a brassier post-vaudevillian trumpet. The set includes many
crucial movie songs, the most wrenching being ``The Man That Got
Away'' from ``A Star Is Born.'' The selections from Garland's years
at Capitol include two swinging Nelson Riddle-arranged performances
and two dark-night-of-the-soul selections from her Gordon Jenkins
album, ``Alone'' as well as are high points from her landmark 1961
concert album, ``Judy At Carnegie Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Disks three and four concentrate almost entirely on excerpts (in
mono) from Garland's television show and include her first
television duet with Liza Minnelli as well as duets with Tony
Bennett (Garland's favorite male singer), Bobby Darin and Barbra
Streisand (their famous medley of ``Get Happy!'' and ``Happy Days
Are Here Again''). Also here are her rousing post-Kennedy
assassination version of ``The Battle Hymn of the Republic'' and a
heart-stopping rendition of her favorite song, ``Through the
Years.''
</P>
<P>
   Even at its most disturbing, it's powerful stuff. A performer
who always gave her all, Garland more than lived up to her nickname
(and title of her first Capitol album) ``Miss Show Business.'' &QL;

 &HT;    COURT PUSHES FOR SETTLEMENT IN BLACK FARMERS LAWSUIT
 &HT;    BY NICHOLE MONROE
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge on Tuesday heavily pressed black
farmers and the Department of Agriculture to reach a settlement in
a nationwide discrimination case.
</P>
<P>
   In a hearing to discuss the status of the class-action case,
U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman upheld a planned February trial
date and said if the USDA is serious about remedying past
discrimination against farmers, all efforts should be made to reach
an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman said a settlement is even more appropriate since both
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman and President Clinton have
acknowledged some farmers have a legitimate case against the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the secretary of agriculture is saying these things in good
faith . . . then why can't it get done?'' Friedman asked. ``Trials
aren't necessarily the best way to solve systemic problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Although USDA lawyers declined to discuss details of settlement
negotiations in court, spokesman John Sparks said the department
has submitted an offer that seems appealing to farmers . He said
that although the two sides are growing closer to agreement,
several issues still need to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more than just throwing money at the issue,'' said
Sparks, who works in the agency's office of civil rights. ``What we
really want to do is afford redress to those deserving of it and
get as many farmers who want to farm back to farming. There are a
lot of details that need to be worked out to achieve the goal we
all want to achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks said solutions may include giving farmers access to
lending programs or returning land that was foreclosed on.
</P>
<P>
   The $2.5 billion lawsuit filed by more than 400 farmers contends
that, since 1983, the USDA denied or delayed their bids for
government farm loans because of their race. It also claims the
agency ignored or unfairly rejected their discrimination
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Friedman certified the farmers as a class, meaning they
can sue the government as a group rather than have to pursue cases
individually.
</P>
<P>
   In the event negotiations fail, USDA lawyers said Tuesday they
doubted whether they will be prepared for a Feb. 1 trial. However,
farmer representatives said they are ready to go to court as
scheduled, if not sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the government is just buying time,'' said J. L.
Chestnut, a lawyer representing the farmers. ``It is in the
government's best interest to delay this. . . . We don't have
one-tenth of the resources available to the government. These poor
farmers are ready for trial.''
</P>
<P>
   During the hearing, department lawyers also questioned whether
the court has a right to hear cases that fall under the agency's
jurisdiction. They said the court may need to remand the cases of
the 12 initial plaintiffs back to the agency for further
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   However, Friedman said the department already has had the
opportunity to investigate the farmers' claims, and in many cases
either ignored them or lost their files. He said the court will not
remand the cases, and unless there is a settlement, ``we're going
to have a trial.''

SUPREME COURT HEARS ARGUMENTS IN MAJOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS CASE 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal regulators squared off against local
telephone companies at the Supreme Court on Tuesday, with the
future of local telephone service potentially hanging in the
balance of this bitter fight.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was whether Congress, in a 1996 law, gave the Federal
Communications Commission broad authority to require that existing
local telephone companies, such as Bell Atlantic, give new firms
access to phone lines in an effort to increase competition for
local service. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with
state agencies and local telephone companies in ruling that the FCC
lacked such a broad mandate, prompting a Supreme Court appeal from
the federal government and firms seeking to provide local service.
</P>
<P>
   Solicitor General Seth Waxman, pressing FCC's case, said the
agency has been regulating telephone service for 65 years and,
since the breakup of AT&AMP;T, ensuring competition in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Established companies ``have never embraced competition,'' said
Waxman, the Clinton administration's chief spokesman before the
justices. ``This act was not designed to protect AT&AMP;T.''
</P>
<P>
   However, attorney William Barr, representing local telephone
companies Ameritech Corp. and GTE, countered that the FCC violated
its limited authority under the 1996 Telecommunications Act by
requiring existing companies to grant fledgling competitors wide
access to phone lines at wholesale prices. The law says FCC can
grant new local companies access only to those lines needed to
begin service, but the agency has misinterpreted the statute by
allowing these firms access to all the lines they want, Barr
argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrants sometimes want what they don't need,'' the Washington
lawyer said, adding that the FCC rule gives these new companies
``the most promiscuous right to access you can imagine.'' As a
result, start-up local firms get instant, inexpensive access to
phone lines and technology that the established companies have
spent a fortune to install, Barr told the justices.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, reflecting the enormity of an issue that has
prompted eight separate appeals to the justices, took the unusual
step of scheduling two hours of oral arguments in the matter _
twice the amount of time the court usually gives attorneys. During
the session, the justices peppered government attorneys and lawyers
for existing and fledgling local phone companies with questions
addressing whether Congress gave the FCC authority to regulate
local service and order companies to provide access to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist asked Waxman how the agency
can regulate competitive access for local service when the law
limits federal jurisdiction to interstate and foreign commerce.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Waxman said that telephone lines do not distinguish
between local and interstate service. The same lines that handle
calls down the street also connect telephones across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission has unquestioned jurisdiction'' over interstate
commerce, Waxman said. ``Congress recognized that the use of
(telephone) network elements is inextricably entwined with both''
interstate and local service, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen G. Breyer, noting Barr's criticism of the FCC
regulations, asked the attorney if he could suggest a more fair
rule.
</P>
<P>
   Barr responded that the agency should address individual
requests for access from companies seeking to provide local service
rather than establish a national rule that fails to consider the
particular relationship each established company has with its new
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia was especially critical in questioning
attorneys on both sides of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   He assailed a lawyer for companies seeking to enter the local
market, Bruce Ennis Jr. of Washington, for arguing that state
agencies retain their authority to regulate phone service _ so long
as the FCC agrees with the state's decision. In that case, state
agencies could regulate only at ``the grace of the FCC,'' Scalia
said in a comment Ennis did not contest.
</P>
<P>
   The justice, however, also derided the argument of Diane Munns,
the Iowa Commerce Department's general counsel, who said state
agencies have sole authority to set rates, without fear of FCC
oversight. ``You can (then) have 50 states with 50 different sets
of regulations,'' Scalia said incredulously.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy was even more critical of Munns'
argument, saying it ``doesn't make sense'' that California could
have one set of telephone access rules while New York could have
another.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Munns said FCC can regulate local telephone service
only if Congress expressly states that it can. She added that the
1996 act provides FCC with no local regulatory authority.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University law Professor Laurence Tribe, pressing the
case of established local phone companies, said the
telecommunications law states with ``great precision'' that local
commissions can set rates and makes no reference to FCC regulation
in that area. However, some justices seemed unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation has great precision?'' Scalia said with
surprise, noting the sharp difference of opinion regarding FCC
authority under the controversial law. Breyer asked whether the
court is presented with an option of ``all or none'' in which the
FCC has either pre-eminent authority over rates or no authority
whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   Tribe responded that any authority FCC would have under the law
would be as a ``backstop'' to ensure state agencies comply with
federal procedural guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   However, attorney David Carpenter, representing companies that
want to provide local phone service, said Congress intended FCC to
have wide discretion to require that established telecommunications
firms grant access to their existing phone lines. ``The non-AT&AMP;Ts
of the world cannot build alternative facilities,'' the Chicago
lawyer told the justices.
</P>
<P>
   The high court is expected to render its decision by July. &QL;

CLIVE BARKER CREATES `LIVING MOVIE' FOR UNIVERSAL STUDIOS
</HEADLINE>
 
(Includes optional breakout box of upcoming appearances) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Clive Barker is at peace. No, not as in RIP.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few years, Barker had been uncomfortable being seen
as the ``horror guy,'' who is invited out at Halloween to comment
on the Dark Side. He felt remote from his earlier works, such as
``Books of Blood'' (1984), intense horror tales that Barker calls
``violent, visceral, erotic stuff.'' But these stories and his
``Hellraiser'' movies had made his reputation. And no less an
authority than Stephen King had christened him ``the future of
horror.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barker felt that he had grown as an artist and gone on to
other things, including his fantasy novels and his painting, and
bristled at being pigeonholed.
</P>
<P>
   Then last year, he attended a Halloween celebration and, well,
enjoyed himself. And Barker still seems to be enjoying himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's exactly right,'' he says with a laugh when it's
suggested that he's come to peace with himself and his image.
Though he still feels remote from the man who created ``Books of
Blood,'' Barker says, he has a new respect for the stories and for
his former self.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the man who created Pinhead, the urbane, spike-faced minion
of evil with a bloodlust for human souls from the ``Hellraiser''
movies, has turned his talents to creating a maze for Universal
Studios Hollywood, ``Halloween Horror Nights II,'' which will begin
Friday, to give fright fans their ``own private piece of horror
theater.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clive Barker's Freakz,'' which Universal is billing as a
``living movie,'' will use 35 actors, Barker says, and ``each
person will get a slightly different experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Barker says Universal was indulgent with him. ``They haven't
made me water anything down,'' and he wasn't obliged to use
Universal horror figures such as the Frankenstein monster, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 15 minutes into the meeting with Clive I knew we had the
right person,'' says Norm Kahn, vice president of entertainment at
Universal Studios Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understands how to build horror and tension.'' ``Freakz,''
says Kahn, is ``an assortment of horrific oddities that Clive has
gathered from around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Barker admits that creating the maze appeals to the
showman and voyeur in him, he also acknowledges the public's
craving to be frightened. ``If we gave them watered-down scare
they'd be angry,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something deeply perverse about this. If something
like this happened to us in real life _ a completely negative thing
_ we'd reject it wholesale. But if it's a safe environment, like a
movie or a ride or a book that we can put down, there's a very
strong public appetite for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Barker says that what he is doing with the maze is the same as
what King calls ``taking the reader into the morgue and feeling
beneath the sheets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What it is,'' Barker says, ``is a confrontation with death in
a very safe environment. If we walk away from the play environment
having confronted death ... then maybe we are stronger when we
confront it in the real world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all need to do this. We're all going to die.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day we talk, Barker is celebrating his 46th birthday, and
so maybe mortality is on his mind. ``The years tick on and you get
closer to the end,'' he philosophizes, ``and that's part of the
dynamic of being alive. Knowing we're on that journey.''
</P>
<P>
   He then points out how newspapers tell us every day that there
are innumerable ways we may not die peaceably, and that there is
this need in people to feel an adrenaline rush _ such as a near
miss on the highway _ that makes them feel more alive than they did
before it happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that goes again to why people need these kinds of
experiences (horror shows, etc.) in their lives,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But Barker is sounding very upbeat and alive this day, enjoying
a Havana cigar as he talks. And there isn't much time to be ``at
peace.'' Besides the horror maze, the Renaissance man has a list of
ongoing projects that would make the rest of us just tired from
looking at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clive is like David Bowie. He constantly reinvents himself,''
says Del Howison, the owner of Dark Delicacies, a horror book shop
in Burbank. ``I think that's almost for sanity reasons. ... When
you've accomplished something, why would you want to repeat
yourself? Clive constantly has broken new ground, whether it's his
artwork, writing or filmmaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Howison was hooked on Barker from his early books but has
watched the author expand his horizons, citing Jean Cocteau, the
French film director, as one of Barker's inspirations. ``Cocteau,''
Howison says, ``didn't limit himself to one thing, and Clive hasn't
done that, either.''
</P>
<P>
   If you doubt it, just look at what's on Barker's calendar. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Beginning Halloween eve at a Los Angeles-area gallery, an
exhibit of Barker's artwork, ``The Weird and the Wicked,'' goes on
display. He describes it as ``chiefly erotic work and some fantasy
stuff.'' Howison points out that Barker always has made himself
accessible to fans, and prices his artwork beginning at around $600
so it's not out of reach for his public.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's ``Gods and Monsters,'' which will be out in
November. The film, which Barker produced, deals with the life and
career of ``Frankenstein'' director James Whale. Directed by Bill
Condon (``Candyman Farewell to the Flesh''), ``Gods and Monsters,''
stars Sir Ian McKellan, Brendan Fraser and Lynn Redgrave, and has
been getting early raves.
</P>
<P>
   The energetic Barker hopes that ``Weaveworld,'' the miniseries
adaptation of his fantasy novel for Showtime, will go before the
cameras next spring. He's also developing ``Heretics,'' a TV series
for HBO that is described as being about America's dark secret
lineage.
</P>
<P>
   And he's still writing. In June, he released his 11th book,
``Galilee'' (HarperPrism), a novel he labeled ``a romance'' that
chronicles the interwoven histories of two powerful families, one
human and one divine. For next October, he is writing a collection
of short stories _ something he hasn't done since ``Books of
Blood'' _ that will contain both horror and fantasy tales. And then
two years down the road, there's ``The Book of Hours,'' which is 25
6,000-word stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything brings out a slightly different side to what I'm up
to,'' he says, quipping that all these projects keep him off the
streets, which means he's busy coming up with new adrenaline rushes
for his fans.
</P>
<P>
   So, what scares the man who scares us?
</P>
<P>
   Barker admits to a fear of ``airplanes, elevators, anything
that's claustrophobic.'' Seeing a couple of his friends committed
to mental institutions and going to visit them made him feel
uneasy. It's that ``fear that we might be perceived as crazy or
that we are crazy and don't know it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Anything else?
</P>
<P>
   ``Running out of Havanas,'' he says, laughing.
</P>
<P>

ROBBING GRAVES IN ODD SEARCH FOR `THE NEW' 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Oct. 18) 
(JT) 
 By BERNARD HOLLAND    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As musicologists and record labels look ever harder for
something new _ some novelty to justify their jobs or prod their
affairs forward _ the line between scholarly inquiry and
grave-robbing blurs.
</P>
<P>
   The American auto industry knew better and concentrated on the
living. It did so by inventing planned obsolescence, a strategy by
which dissatisfaction with a crumbling prior purchase was made to
intersect with the promise of something shiny and virginal to take
its place. A rhythm of life and death, carefully choreographed and
spaced out over two or three years, made auto makers billions.
</P>
<P>
   Planned obsolescence works less well in classical music, which
has invested the bulk of its holdings in the used-symphony and
used-opera business, and has lots of trouble convincing listeners
that the new models are any good. So in this moribund compact with
the past, musical newness _ always the catalyst for waking the
sleepy customer _ has to be sought by going backward.
</P>
<P>
   The early-music movement succeeded by devising the spiffy new
concept of historical accuracy. Previously, old music was played
the way each new generation heard it, if it was played at all. Now
one is invited to trade in the gas-guzzler for the slimmed-down
compact: Hamilton Harty's Handel exchanged for the sleek 1998
Harnoncourt.
</P>
<P>
   A further strategy for cooking up novelty is to unearth those
long laid to rest, prop them up and associate them with what is
happening in the present. There was evidently grant money available
a few years back to organize a scholarly conclave on Bruckner and
the Nazis, and one hopes that participants had a pleasantly
subsidized few days on some leafy campus.
</P>
<P>
   Raising from the dead a man who died in 1896 because very bad
people played his music 40 years later in their own grandiose,
self-serving way may not be fair. Not Bruckner's fault, the
argument will go, but the name is tarnished nonetheless. Why not a
seminar on Grieg because some present-day serial killer whistled
his tunes while carving up victims?
</P>
<P>
   Still another retro-search for novelty aims at composers
themselves, the latest exercise being the premiere by the pianist
Alan Feinberg and the Cleveland Orchestra of a concerto that
Charles Ives imagined but, depending on your point of view, either
never actually wrote or wrote so many times that any one version is
meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   The ethical justifications of David Porter's newly reconstructed
``Emerson'' Concerto are mixed, but what of someone like Brahms?
Are there unsung masterpieces hidden on library shelves? Might not
the earliest pieces that he declined to publish still advertise the
embryonic genius?
</P>
<P>
   Brahms was too smart for the academy and the record companies.
Probably the first composer systematically to plan his life after
death, he burned everything musicologists might otherwise have got
their hands on. Debussy was less farsighted, and scarcely a year
goes by that some schoolboy exercise of his is not advertised as an
important gift to the pre-Impressionist literature.
</P>
<P>
   Debussy surely expected his juvenilia to be buried with him, but
he did not count on all those musicological shovels scraping at his
coffin. Berg has suffered similarly, and Webern, too _ especially
Webern, whose name on symphony programs promises the avant-garde
but almost always delivers some white-hot late-Romantic sin of his
youth: certainly not music he wanted to be remembered for.
</P>
<P>
   Grave-robbing, I must admit, sometimes pleases. ``The Garden of
Eden,'' unpublished in Hemingway's lifetime, turns out to be one of
his best books. But what of those lily-gilders writing out
posthumous piano accompaniments for Bach's solo string music? The
``new'' Ives concerto is a different matter. It was real enough in
Ives' mind to inspire nearly 40 years of tinkering, but I
personally wish that Porter had left the ``Emerson'' Concerto to
rest in its untidy tomb: not as a clumsy-sounding finished product
but as an elaborate impulse more interesting to think about than to
hear.
</P>
<P>
   Digging for Ives is a less egregious form of grave-robbing than
a lot of other examples. For little of Ives' important music was
published when it was written, and his output lacks the
pronouncement of completeness implied by black and white set on
paper by some publishing house. We are teased with possibility _ or
impossibility.
</P>
<P>
   The urge to complete seems to vary with the times. The 18th
century valued order and abhorred loose ends. The Romantics, on the
other hand, made ancient ruins _ the marble steps leading nowhere,
the great columns supporting nothing _ a source of reverie.
</P>
<P>
   We seem to be somewhere in between. Modern science doesn't
exactly picture a tidy, knowable universe, and in sympathy, I
think, a lot of new music makes beginnings, middles and ends a
vague concept. Musical restorers with little faith in the future
keep burrowing in the past. The motives range from
self-aggrandizement to the thrill of the chase or sincere
dedication to a composer. One applauds Deryck Cooke's motives for
reconstructing Mahler's 10th Symphony, while at the same time
siding with Mother Nature, who in her wisdom allowed Mahler only
the finished Adagio. Potent by virtue of its enforced isolation,
this frightening music is obscured by the walls Cooke rebuilt

   Restorers, their zeal and craftsmanship notwithstanding, worry
us as we watch them filling in the silences left by a dead creator:

 &HT;    AIR STRIKES AVERTED - FOR NOW, PROBLEMS REMAIN IN KOSOVO
 &HT;    With BOSNIA-STRIKES-1014.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. pilots, diplomats and military observers will
begin moving this week into positions to help monitor a Serb
military pullback in Kosovo, but President Clinton warned TUESDAY
that the threat of NATO air strikes will hang over Belgrade until
Serbs have ended their campaign of repression and terror against
Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   While pledges by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic have
averted NATO airstrikes for now, Clinton stressed that the United
States and its allies would rely on an ''intrusive'' verification
regime -- some 2,000 observers on the ground supported by military
surveillance aircraft in the skies -- to determine whether the
Serbs live up to their word.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be facts, facts on the ground, which will tell us
whether or not the compliance is there,'' Clinton told reporters on
the South Lawn of the White House. ''I certainly would hope that
this NATO position will, in effect, be maintained until all the
conditions are fully met, and I expect that it will be.''
</P>
<P>
   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, has given
Milosevic until Friday night to comply with a Monday agreement
concerning Kosovo or face the prospect of air strikes carried out
by a massive, U.S.-led force.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments made clear that he favors retaining the
threat of NATO force for the foreseeable future, as the
verification team moves into place to monitor Serb actions on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the verification regime were still being hammered out
as of late Tuesday, the day after Milosevic agreed to pare back
military and other security forces in the southern province of
Kosovo and enter into talks centered on Kosovar autonomy in
exchange for a reprieve from a threatened NATO attack.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the United States and three dozen other
members of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) will provide some 2,000 observers who will go unarmed into
Kosovo and fan out across the province to verify Serb compliance
with Monday's accord. It wasn't known how many of the observers
would be Americans, though several administration sources suggested
it would be at least several dozen.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic also agreed to enter into negotiations -- by early
next month -- over a path toward autonomy for Kosovo. Nine in ten
residents of the province, part of Yugoslavia, are ethnic
Albanians. Since 1989, however, the province has been governed by
ethnic Serbs, under a series of decrees and legislation ushered
through by Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke brokered Monday's accord with an
eye toward three basic goals:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  end Serb violence that has led to the deaths of hundreds of
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ensure the safety of an estimated 300,000 Albanians that have
fled their homes so that they might return before winter takes a
grisly humanitarian toll;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  and set up negotiations between the government of Serb
nationalist Milosevic and the Kosovars aimed at returning to the
Albanian majority some measure of control over the institutions of
provincial government -- chiefly, the police, judiciary, schools
and local administrative organs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea here is you have a verification mission in place to
provide confidence and security to the people of Kosovo that they
can get the food they need, they will not be subject to police
intimidation, that they can come back to their homes ... pending a
political settlement,'' said U.S. State Department spokesman James
Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   Fully staffing and deploying the observer mission could take
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers, however, were expected to begin moving within
days, likely beginning with a doubling and reactivation of the much
smaller Kosovo Diplomatic Observers Mission, or KDOM, that had been
operating in Kosovo under the auspices of NATO and the OSCE. The
KDOM team, roughly 50 observers, had recently moved out of Kosovo
due to escalating violence and the prospect of a possible NATO
attack, but was expected to return within days.
</P>
<P>
   Observers on the ground will be assisted by NATO aircraft,
including U.S. planes, flying over Kosovo on surveillance missions.
No NATO warplanes are envisioned for the mission, though the
Pentagon suggested that combat aircraft would be available to
support the reconnaissance planes if they came under threat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll leave it to NATO to figure out whether they want to
disclose how they're going to handle the protection of those
flights,'' Pentagon spokesman Cpt. Michael Doubleday told
reporters. ''There are plenty of aircraft to take any steps that
NATO commanders feel are necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the risk to NATO pilots, air defense systems operated
by the Yugoslav military will be moved out of Kosovo or placed
under the observation of international monitors. In addition,
Yugoslav combat aircraft will not be permitted to fly in the
vicinity of NATO surveillance aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Doubleday said NATO would have ''unrestricted access'' to the
airspace above Kosovo, but would file advance flight plans with
Yugoslav officials ''up to several days in advance,'' of NATO
flights.
</P>
<P>
   ''But if it becomes necessary, because of weather or other
considerations, to set up one of these flights on a very rapid
basis, it could be done with as little as an hour's notice,''
Doubleday told reporters during a Pentagon briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were quick to point out potential flaws in Monday's
accord and the plans for verifying Serb compliance with it.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, while Monday's agreement calls for Milosevic to
pull back thousands of troops and police, some backed with armor
and heavy artillery, from Kosovo, it allows him to maintain
thousands more who were already in the area before he unleashed an
aggressive campaign of terror last February upon the ethnic
Albanian Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're still going to be at the mercy of Serbian force,''
said Kurt Bassuener, associate director of the Balkan Action
Council, a non-profit research outfit here.
</P>
<P>
   Bassuener also fears that unarmed observers on the ground in
Kosovo might be used as human shields by Serbs should NATO threaten
future strikes. Similar concerns were an impediment to NATO strikes
against Serbs during three and a half years of fighting in
neighboring Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ''These people,'' in Kosovo, ''could have the same effect,''
Bassuener said.
</P>
<P>
   To anticipate that problem, NATO will set up a rapid reaction
force just outside of Kosovo -- possibly in nearby Macedonia, where
a U.S. military observer mission has been stationed for several
years -- that would have the capability to conduct combat rescue
missions on short notice.
</P>
<P>
   And, while U.S. officials declined to publicly discuss the
prospect of observers being used as human shields, one White House
official said privately that ''It would be a gross
miscalculation,'' for Serbs to threaten observers, adding that
''any punitive response would be decisive.''

EDUCATION SPENDING, IMF DISPUTES DELAYING BUDGET DEAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
and DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Disputes over education spending and the
International Monetary Fund kept White House and Republican
negotiators from a budget deal Tuesday, raising the possibility
that Congress may have to approve a fourth stopgap funding measure
today to keep the government from shutting down.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from an afternoon meeting with White House Chief of
Staff Erskine Bowles and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., said the prospects for a final 1999
spending agreement did not look good, given the deep divisions over
education and other policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having very difficult negotiations about very serious
principles, whether Washington controls everything or local
citizens have an impact on their own lives,'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am much less optimistic than I was this morning because I am
beginning to realize how far apart we are,'' the speaker said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich had predicted on Monday that an agreement would be
reached by Tuesday night and that the House and Senate would vote
on it today. But instead of voting on a final package of spending
items for the new fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, members may have
to approve yet another interim funding measure to keep government
departments running past midnight when a stopgap bill passed Monday
will expire.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have said they are willing to continue funding
federal agencies with short-term spending authorizations to avoid a
repeat of the 1995 budget disaster when the public largely blamed
them for two partial government shutdowns. Clinton has said that he
would continue to sign the authorizations. But with the Nov. 3
election now less than three weeks away, most members are eager to
get on with their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   House Appropriations Chairman Bob Livingston, R-N.Y., said he
was telling members not to lose heart, that negotiations are ``95
percent done.'' But he acknowledged that negotiators are stuck on
issues such as education, financial support and reform questions
for the IMF, family planning and abortion language in the foreign
aid provisions, and how to conduct the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Clinton and Republican leaders have agreed on only five
of 13 major appropriations bills needed to fund all government
departments and agencies. They hope to roll the remaining eight
into one catch-all bill that would finish out the appropriations
process for the 1999 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the remaining disputes is Clinton's request for
$18 billion for the IMF. House Republicans have agreed to the
funding, but are insisting that the IMF undertake some strict
reforms like shortening the amount of time it gives countries to
repay loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There remain some issues that Treasury and the Congress are
trying to work out, but we've made a lot of progress,'' White House
Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a tentative agreement worked out late Monday, the
Clinton administration will require loan periods be reduced from
three years to no more than 2 1/2 years, according to Republican
sources.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF also would be forced to halt its practice of making
loans at below-market rates, which House Majority Leader Dick
Armey, R-Irving, repeatedly has complained about.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also are pushing for greater openness at the IMF by
requiring it to provide written summaries of board meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department, meanwhile, would be required to oppose
future IMF loan payments to South Korea, unless federal officials
can certify that IMF funds are not being used to subsidize Korean
industries.
</P>
<P>
   The additional funding would be used by the IMF to replenish
coffers depleted during its 1 {- year battle against a world
economic crisis that has hit economies from Thailand to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is one of 182 member countries with financial
stakes in the IMF. But as the fund's largest shareholder, with an
18 percent share in the entity, Washington's concerns carry great
weight.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the IMF issues, Republicans are balking at
Clinton's request for nearly $4 billion more in education money
that he wants earmarked for helping some of the nation's most needy
communities build new schools and hire more teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have agreed to provide more money, but they want it
disbursed to the states in the form of block grants so that local
officials can decide how to use it. Clinton and the Democrats,
however, have refused to give in to that demand, saying the block
grants would end up being used for administrative costs or other
programs that would not achieve the ultimate goal of reducing class
size.
</P>
<P>
   They say a big portion of the money under the GOP block grant
proposal would end up going to school districts that are wealthy
enough to provide more teachers and build more schools without the
input of ``federal seed money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The net result of a block grant would be a significant shift
of federal funds from poor schools and communities to wealthier
ones,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Texas Democrats in Congress share that view. On
Tuesday, Texas Reps. Sheila Jackson Lee, Gene Green and Ken Bentsen
joined with Reps. Lloyd Doggett of Austin and Ciro Rodriguez of San
Antonio, Texas, to endorse the Clinton plan.
</P>
<P>
   The five lawmakers expressed concern that Texas could end up
losing $17 million in education money under the block grant
proposal. They said the only way the money would end up in the
neediest communities would be for the federal government to dictate
how it could be used and where it would go.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to earmark to make sure it goes to the classroom,''
said Rodriguez, summing up the position of his colleagues. &QL;

SUPREME COURT LETS STAND LAW BARRING LEGISLATION PROTECTING GAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two years after overturning an anti-gay rights
amendment to the Colorado constitution, the Supreme Court on
Tuesday left intact a similar measure barring protective
legislation for gay people in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   The court refused to hear a challenge to the Cincinnati charter
amendment, which voters adopted in 1993 and which a federal appeals
court found last year to be constitutional. On the surface, the
justices' action sent a confusing signal about whether the court
still meant what it said, by a 6-3 majority in the Colorado case,
about the Constitution not permitting gay people to be stripped of
legal protection and made ``strangers to the law.''
</P>
<P>
   However, although the court's disposition of the Cincinnati case
Tuesday was evidently unanimous, three justices took the unusual
step of explaining the action in a separate statement that put the
case in a different and less suggestive light.
</P>
<P>
   While the three _ Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter
and Ruth Bader Ginsburg _ spoke only for themselves, they offered a
rare window into the court's internal deliberations over whether to
take up a new case, deliberations that usually end only with a
published order of ``granted'' or ``denied.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the three justices said, the actual meaning of the
Cincinnati amendment was sufficiently ambiguous, and sufficiently
different from the Colorado amendment struck down in Romer vs.
Evans, as to make the case at this point a poor vehicle for a
Supreme Court decision.
</P>
<P>
   The justices noted that in upholding the measure last year, the
6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had interpreted it as barring
only ``special protection'' for gay men and lesbians, as opposed to
taking the more sweeping step of depriving gay people of the
general anti-discrimination protections available to other groups.
In the Colorado case, by contrast, the Supreme Court said the
state's Amendment 2 could fairly be read as depriving gay men and
lesbians ``even of the protection of general laws,'' amounting to
``a denial of equal protection of the laws in the most literal
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   While the gay rights groups challenging the Cincinnati amendment
insisted that it was essentially identical to the Colorado
provision, the 6th Circuit found otherwise. In its 1997 decision,
the appeals court, which sits in Cincinnati, said there was a
``stark contrast'' between the two provisions, with the Colorado
provision having excluded gay people ``from the protection of every
Colorado state law'' while Cincinnati's charter amendment ``merely
prevented homosexuals, as homosexuals, from obtaining special
privileges and preferences,'' such as affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   In their statement Tuesday, Stevens, Souter and Ginsburg said
the dispute over what the Cincinnati amendment actually means
``counsels against granting the petition.'' They said that ``this
court does not normally make an independent examination of state
law questions that have been resolved by a court of appeals,''
adding that the denial of review should not be taken as an
indication of the court's views on the underlying issues. The case
was Equality Foundation of Greater Cincinnati vs. City of
Cincinnati, No. 97-1795.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Goldberg, a lawyer with the Lambda Legal Defense and
Education fund, a gay rights group that challenged both the
Colorado and Cincinnati amendments, said Tuesday that the Supreme
Court's action cast no doubt on the nondiscrimination principle the
court adopted in the Colorado decision of two years ago. However,
she said in an interview, her group would monitor the situation in
Cincinnati to make sure that the amendment, known locally as Issue
3, was indeed as ``meaningless'' as the 6th Circuit opinion found
it to be. ``This is not the end of the battle over Issue 3,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati charter amendment was adopted after a campaign by
a group called Equal Rights, Not Special Rights. That group's
lawyer, Michael Carvin, said in an interview Tuesday that he
interpreted the court as sending a signal that while under the rule
of the Colorado case, states cannot bar gay rights legislation at
the state level, localities can do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Local citizen initiatives can overturn gay rights laws even if
states cannot,'' he said, adding that the action Tuesday
demonstrated that ``the court will not extend Romer vs. Evans to
the facts of this case.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While the litigation that led to Tuesday's case challenged the
amendment on its face, rather than in any particular application,
specific cases could come up next, she said. One Cincinnati
ordinance, enacted before the voters adopted Issue 3, prohibits
discrimination in city employment on the basis of race, sex,
religion, disability, national origin and sexual orientation. If a
gay city employee challenges an adverse employment action as
discriminatory, the Ohio state courts will have to decide whether
Issue 3 is as narrowly drawn as the 6th Circuit found it to be.
</P>
<P>
   If the 6th Circuit was right, Issue 3 would be irrelevant to the
operation of a general anti-discrimination law, which would
continue to protect gay people on the same basis as other protected
groups. But if Issue 3, properly interpreted, does carve gay people
out from such generally worded protection, then a new case would
move back up through the courts with the amendment in a different
light.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the court's action Tuesday nor the Cincinnati dispute
bears on the further, and distinct, question of whether sexual
orientation should be included as a protected category in
hate-crimes legislation. Such laws are newly in the spotlight
following the recent slaying of a gay college student in Wyoming.
While 40 states have some form of hate crimes legislation, only 21
include crimes based on sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati voters adopted Issue 3 by a margin of 62 percent to
38 percent. It is entitled: ``No special class status may be
granted based upon sexual orientation, conduct or relationships.''
It is the only such provision currently on the books anywhere in
the country, according to Ms. Goldberg, the co-author of a newly
published book on the Colorado case called ``Strangers to the Law''
(University of Michigan Press, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   Issue 3 provides that the city, including various boards and
commissions, ``may not enact, adopt, enforce, or administer any
ordinance, regulation, rule or policy which provides that
homosexual, lesbian or bisexual orientation, status, conduct, or
relationship constitutes, entitles, or otherwise provides a person
with the basis to have any claim of minority or protected status,
quota preference or other preferential treatment.''

ARMY CORPS PROPOSES HUGE RESTORATION OF EVERGLADES ECOSYSTEM

 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN JR.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Army Corps of Engineers on Tuesday proposed its
comprehensive plan for replumbing the Everglades, an $8 billion,
20-year project that proponents called the most ambitious
restoration of an ecosystem ever attempted.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which was years in the making, would radically alter
how fresh water is stored and how it flows south from above Lake
Okeechobee to Everglades National Park and the Florida Bay. It
would capture up to 85 percent of the fresh water _ hundreds of
billions of gallons a year _ that is now channeled out to sea
during the wet season, leaving the Everglades parched when the
rains cease.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the water would be stored in massive lagoons and
in underground aquifers, some to be released in the kind of
sheet-like flow that used to seep across the gently inclined
landscape, regulated only by the seasons, until settlement and
development interfered.
</P>
<P>
   And some of the water would continue to be used for irrigation
or to slake the thirst of urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   After a few months of public comment, the corps will revise the
plan and present it next summer to Congress, which has to approve
it before the work begins, probably not before the year 2002. Half
the expense would be paid by the federal government, and the other
half by the state of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore made the plan public during a visit to
Florida Tuesday, two days ahead of its scheduled release by the
Army Corps of Engineers, which manages federal water projects. As
he spoke, budget negotiators in Washington were still arguing over
how much to spend for related water- and land-acquisition projects
in Florida _ a sign that the proposal remains far from a certainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an ambitious and aggressive plan, but this much we
know: The cost of inaction cannot be afforded,'' Gore said. ``It is
way too high.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental advocates, one of Gore's core constituencies,
embraced the plan enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important for a lot of reasons,'' said Stuart Strahl,
executive director of the National Audubon Society's Everglades
office. ``It is important because it is an endangered ecosystem,
because there is no other ecosystem like it in the world, because
it is our most endangered national park and because it is a test
case of our interest in living sustainably with a natural
ecosystem.''
</P>
<P>
   Even big agriculture companies that have been leery of plans to
remove land from farming spoke approvingly, noting that unless
something is done they will face water crises in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next 50 years we are going to have significant
problems and we are not going to survive if we don't do something
to re-engineer the system,'' said Malcolm Wade Jr., senior vice
president of U.S. Sugar Corp., one of the region's biggest
landowners.
</P>
<P>
   About 170,000 acres of agricultural land will be replaced by
storage reservoirs and storm water treatment plants, the corps
study said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan has several key features, many of which reverse the
corps' practices going back for decades as it ditched and drained
the Everglades. These features include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Large water reservoirs will be built north of Lake Okeechobee,
in the Caloosahatchee and St. Lucie basins, in the Everglades
Agricultural Area and along western Palm Beach, Broward and
Miami-Dade counties.
</P>
<P>
   _ Water will be stored underground _ recharging the aquifer _ by
pumping it into more than 300 wells that may accept as much as 1.6
billion gallons a day. The injected fresh water would form a bubble
around existing underground salt water and could be pumped back up
when it is needed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fresh water would be sent southward on more natural patterns
by removing more than 500 miles of canals and levees and rebuilding
the Tamiami Trail (U.S. 41) to let water flow beneath it in more
natural sheets.
</P>
<P>
   But many of these techniques have never been used on such a vast
scale or in regions like the porous flats of Florida, and much
testing lies ahead before the wells and reservoirs can be proved
feasible.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is intended to address problems that stem from existing
water management practices: the loss of 1.7 billion gallons a day
of fresh water into the ocean, the resulting damage to estuaries
where the balance of fresh and salt water is disturbed, the
over-regulation of Lake Okeechobee as a reservoir, the erratic
pulsing of water into the Everglades at the wrong times and in the
wrong amounts, the lack of fresh water flowing into Florida Bay,
the pollution of water by cities and farms and the dwindling
supplies of fresh water for all purposes.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing is done, the study said, water shortages will
increase as the population grows, and the whole ecosystem will be
``vastly degraded.'' Wetlands that store and cleanse flood waters
and provide wildlife habitat will be lost, driving more animals
into extinction, while inland and coastal water quality will
continue to decline. In a state so heavily dependent on fishing and
tourism, the economic effects would be profound, the study said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although environmental groups praised the plan, they said its
success is far from assured.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a perception that somehow the Everglades is saved, or
close to being saved, or well on its way to recovery,'' said Ron
Tipton, a senior program officer of the World Wildlife Federation.
``But the fact is, we are not anywhere near having restored the
Everglades. We are perhaps at the end of the beginning phase of
coming to the critical decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``There are big obstacles in the way _ very big
political and policy obstacles in the way, that we have got to get
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those he cited were the failure of Congress to provide the
money that has already been pledged for Everglades projects,
opposition by the sugar industry, uncertainty over the policies of
Jeb Bush, the front-runner in the race for governor, and hostility
in the Florida Legislature, which last year passed two bills to
weaken Everglades protection, only to have them vetoed.

NOBEL PANEL AWARDS PHYSICS PRIZE TO 3, CHEMISTRY PRIZE TO 2
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill., N.Y., N.J., Mass.)  (bl)  
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

<P>
   Quantum theory, in its most arcane and practical guises, was the
focus of the Nobel Prizes in Physics and Chemistry announced
Tuesday by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. The three winners
of the physics prize and the two winners of the chemistry award are
all university professors in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Quantum theory, which has been evolving since the early 20th
century, is a mathematical framework describing the behavior of
ultra-small objects, including atoms.
</P>
<P>
   The chemistry prize of $978,000 will be shared by Dr. Walter
Kohn, 75, an Austrian-born physicist who works at the University of
California at Santa Barbara, and Dr. John Pople, 73, a Briton who
is a mathematician at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Their achievements helped extend the mathematics of quantum
mechanics to predicting specific chemical reactions and to
designing molecules for use in medicine and other applications.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the laureates in chemistry is a chemist. ``I don't
even have a degree in chemistry,'' Pople said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The physics prize, also $978,000, will be shared by Dr. Robert
Laughlin of Stanford University, 48, Dr. Horst Stoermer, 49, a
German-born professor who works both at Columbia University in New
York and at Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, N.J., and Dr. Daniel
Tsui, 59, a Chinese-born professor at Princeton University.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, when they conducted the research for which they were
honored Tuesday, all three physicists were working for Bell
Laboratories, which is now a part of Lucent Technologies Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Nobel committee honored the three physicists for their
discovery of a phenomenon called the fractional quantum Hall
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Their achievement culminated a series of discoveries that began
in 1879, when an American student, Edwin Hall, found that a
magnetic field applied perpendicularly to a thin metal plate caused
an electric potential to appear that was perpendicular to both the
plate and the magnetic field. This became known as the Hall effect,
and it is commonly used to measure the strength of magnetic fields.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Dr. Klaus von Klitzing, a German physicist,
investigated the Hall effect again and discovered that when the
strength of the magnetic field increased smoothly, the change in
electric potential did not occur smoothly, but in steps that were
proportional to integer numbers _ a hallmark of quantum mechanics.
The phenomenon was named the integer quantum Hall effect, and
Klitzing was awarded the 1985 Nobel Prize in Physics for its
discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Stoermer and Tsui took this a step further in 1982 using an
ultra-powerful magnet at the Francis Bitter National Magnet
Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
Cambridge, Mass. Preparing their experiment at Bell Laboratories,
they pioneered a technique for making a transistor sandwich from
layers of gallium and arsenic. The layers in this sandwich were so
thin that electron movement between them was restricted to two
dimensions instead of the usual three.
</P>
<P>
   Installed in the big MIT magnet and chilled to near absolute
zero, their device exhibited the well known quantum Hall effect,
but with a new twist: the response of the electric potential to
changes in the magnetic field was not only stepwise; it occurred in
thirds of a step. It was as if normal electrons, which are
indivisible, had been split into thirds.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing their results, Laughlin, the theorist of the group,
said he framed an explanation for the effect that was ``completely
wrong, and which, fortunately, was rejected by the referees at the
journal to which I submitted our paper.''
</P>
<P>
   But later, he said, the true explanation came to him. ``It took
about one day,'' he said. ``Science is like that. You spend a long
time in the desert, and then suddenly the truth dawns.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at Bell Laboratories on Tuesday, Stoermer
compared the electrons undergoing the fractional quantum Hall
effect to balls on a billiard table. Because of a weird quantum
effect that occurs when the balls are exposed to a magnetic field
about a million times stronger than that of Earth, they interact
with each other as if they were a fluid, and ``they look as if they
had broken into thirds. When you take the magnetic field away, the
normal electrons reappear and the one-third fractional electrons
disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Laughlin and Stoermer agreed that the fractional quantum Hall
effect was unlikely to have immediate applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more of cosmological than practical interest at the
moment,'' Laughlin said. ``Potentially, it can help us understand
the quantum structure of the vacuum throughout the spacetime of the
universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two great trends in physics: Newtonian reductionism,
in which you look for the wheels and cogs that make the big
mechanism work, and the opposite, in which you take little things
like the equations of motion and see how they make the big
mechanism work. The latter is our approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Laughlin said his 13-year-old son, awakened at 2 a.m., answered
the telephone call from the Nobel committee to notify Laughlin of
the award. ``Some guy is calling from Sweden,'' the boy yelled at
his father.
</P>
<P>
   If some quantum effects occasionally seem more like magic than
reality, quantum chemistry restores the balance.
</P>
<P>
   All very small objects _ molecules, atoms, subnuclear particles,
photons of light and so forth _ obey the rules of quantum
mechanics. Quantum mechanics deals with large assemblages of
particles, and calculates probabilities rather than certainties.
Viewed quantum mechanically, all objects are said to have ``wave
functions'' that include all their possible conditions. For
instance, it is possible, because a wave function includes all
possibilities, for an object to be in two places at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Since the electrons that orbit atoms are quantum particles, the
mathematics of quantum mechanics apply to them, and physicists and
chemists have long known that it is theoretically possible to
predict the interactions of atoms by calculating the wave functions
of their orbital electrons.
</P>
<P>
   In practice these calculations were originally so difficult that
the method had limited use in practical chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 1960s a breakthrough occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Kohn, working at the time at the University of California at San
Diego, discovered that the total energy of an atomic or molecular
system could be calculated from the density of electrons at all
places within the system. Knowing the energy of a chemical system
allows a scientist to calculate how it will react with another
system and what its characteristics may be.
</P>
<P>
   Kohn's approach came to be known as the Density-Functional
Theory, and it is the basis of many aspects of computational
chemistry, in which the geometrical structure of molecules can be
mapped and reactions predicted.
</P>
<P>
   For this, Kohn shares the 1998 chemistry award with Pople, who
refined computer analysis of the quantum mechanics of molecules as
a powerful chemical tool.
</P>
<P>
   Pople was cited by the Nobel committee for his 1970 computer
program named Gaussian, which allows chemists to apply quantum
calculations in making rapid, reasonably accurate estimates of
molecular behavior. Improvements in the Gaussian program, the Nobel
committee said, have been so dramatic that it ``is now used by
thousands of chemists in universities and commercial companies the
world over.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the users are pharmaceutical laboratories seeking
shortcuts in designing effective therapeutic drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In principle, Pople said in an interview, mathematics can
explain all aspects of chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick is tailoring the mathematics to fit,'' he said.

 &HT;    COURT PUSHES FOR SETTLEMENT IN BLACK FARMERS LAWSUIT
 &HT;    Eds: Inserts grafs 8-9 with comment from lawyer for farmers.
 &HT;    BY NICHOLE MONROE
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge Tuesday heavily pressed black
farmers and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to reach a
settlement in a nationwide discrimination case.
</P>
<P>
   In a hearing to discuss the status of the class-action case,
U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman upheld a planned February trial
date and said if the USDA is serious about remedying past
discrimination against farmers, every effort should be made to
reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman said a settlement is even more appropriate since both
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman and President Clinton have
acknowledged some farmers have a legitimate case against the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the secretary of agriculture is saying these things in good
faith ... then why can't it get done?'' Friedman asked. ``Trials
aren't necessarily the best way to solve systemic problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Although USDA lawyers declined to discuss details of settlement
negotiations in court, John Sparks, a special assistant to
Glickman, said the department has submitted an offer that seems
appealing to farmers. He said that although the two sides are
growing closer to agreement, several issues still need to be
addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more than just throwing money at the issue,'' said
Sparks, who works in the agency's Office of Civil Rights. ``What we
really want to do is afford redress to those deserving of it and
get as many farmers who want to farm back to farming. There are a
lot of details that need to be worked out to achieve the goal we
all want to achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks said solutions may include giving farmers access to
lending programs or returning land that was foreclosed on.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Pires Jr., the lead lawyer for the farmers, disagreed
with Sparks, saying the farmers are not close to reaching a
settlement with the USDA.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very difficult agency to work with because they're
not used to paying black farmers, especially in discrimination
cases,'' Pires said. ``They won't put the money on the table, and I
don't think we're making progress at all. I've never seen an offer
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The $2.5 billion lawsuit filed by more than 400 farmers contends
that, since 1983, the USDA denied or delayed their bids for
government farm loans because of their race. It also claims the
agency ignored or unfairly rejected their discrimination
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Friedman certified the farmers as a class, meaning
they can sue the government as a group rather than have to pursue
cases individually.
</P>
<P>
   In the event negotiations fail, USDA lawyers said Tuesday they
doubted whether they will be prepared for a Feb. 1 trial. However,
farmer representatives said they are ready to go to court as
scheduled, if not sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the government is just buying time,'' said J. L.
Chestnut, a lawyer representing the farmers. ``It is in the
government's best interest to delay this. ... We don't have
one-tenth of the resources available to the government. These poor
farmers are ready for trial.''
</P>
<P>
   During the hearing, department lawyers also questioned whether
the court has a right to hear cases that fall under the agency's
jurisdiction. They said the court may need to remand the cases of
the 12 initial plaintiffs back to the agency for further
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   However, Friedman said the department already has had the
opportunity to investigate the farmers' claims, and in many cases
either ignored them or lost their files. He said the court will not
remand the cases, and unless there is a settlement, ``we're going
to have a trial.''

TWO DECADES LATER, FRAT-HOUSE EPIC IS STILL HIGH-WATER MARK IN LOW
COMEDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC CELESTE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, the quintessential frat-house comedy
``National Lampoon's Animal House'' was released, and it signaled a
sea change in major motion-picture comedies. It also coincided with
my father's ascension to his status as Coolest Dad in the History
of Dads.
</P>
<P>
   Pops was living in Denver, recently divorced, and my younger
brother (then 9) and I (11) were visiting him. We had all seen a
``family'' movie together and were leaving the theater when we saw
the poster for ``Animal House,'' an intricate illustration of the
Delta House. Sundry characters poked their heads out of the
frat-house windows, displaying a sense of joie de vivre I had not
known since my dodge-ball days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad, what's this movie?'' I asked. ``Looks kinda crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   My father stared at the poster for a long time. He smiled in an
... unfatherly manner. He spoke slowly. ``Well, it's a very, very
funny movie. But it's not for kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Then something in him snapped. Somehow, the movie's anarchic
sensibility formed itself into a ray of energy that literally shot
forth from the poster and stunned my father, causing the incredibly
irresponsible parental act that ensued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, why not? Go in, boys, and grab a seat. I'll get the
tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when He Who Had Previously Been a Poseur became cool. It
didn't matter that I didn't get many of the jokes. (I had no idea
what a ``frat'' was, didn't even know what a ``zit'' was _ a
crucial bit of knowledge to fully appreciate the famous
Belushi/mashed potatoes gag.) It was still one of the most
indelible moviegoing experiences I've had, and not just because of
the movie's adult dress code. It's because ``Animal House'' was the
perfect slob comedy _ a deft mix of music, lovemaking, friendship
and stupidity that typified the things Americans want to believe
their college experiences were all about.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible I remember the movie so fondly because of the
good-parenting mishap that led to my first viewing of it. (I've
seen the movie, in its entirety, more than 50 times since.) Film
critic Leonard Maltin, for example, says that ``National Lampoon's
Vacation'' was a funnier movie than ``Animal House,'' which he
calls ``sporadically funny.''
</P>
<P>
   About that, consider two things: 1) Leonard's name is
``Leonard''; 2) He's wrong. It's sporadically hysterical. And its
sporadicism is part of the film's charm. It explores other things
that are important to anyone caught in that purgatory between
childhood and adulthood, the age when you are, to quote a country
music lyric, old enough to know better and still too young to care.
</P>
<P>
   There's a sexual awakening (Pinto's attempts to lose his
virginity); class hatred (the rich Omegas vs. the
lower-middle-class Deltas); the cracks that form in longtime
relationships (the love triangle among Boone, Katie and her
professor); and, of course, toga parties (''to-ga, to-ga'').
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the film's many imitators thought ``Animal
House'' was successful ``only'' because of its vulgarity. They
missed elements that made it as much a social commentary as an
exploration of collegiate excess. The film really takes hold when
the Delta House's energy is aimed at conquering the authoritarian
restrictions placed on it by Faber College's Dean Wormer. He
represents the one thing most imitators forget to include: a figure
or institution against which to rebel. The film's sexual subplots
were mindful of this. Although there's plenty of appropriately
gratuitous nudity, the sex scenes weren't just thrown in to undress
the most shockingly proportioned actresses on-set, as ``Porky's''
and its ilk did. Pinto doesn't just find love _ he finds it with
the dean's underage daughter. (Proving you can laugh at something
that, in everyday life, you don't chuckle too often at.) Otter
finds it with the dean's ``wife,'' Mrs. Wormer. Vegetable shopping
was never the same for me.
</P>
<P>
   Neither was movie-watching, at least comedy-watching. ``Animal
House'' still feels fresh, less dated than more ``respectable''
films from the '70s, certainly more so than the tripe we're forced
to sit through these days. ``(BASEketball,'' anyone?) In fact, I
think I'll rent it this weekend. Maybe invite Dad over. I will,
though, make sure my daughter is out of the room. I mean, have you
seen this movie? It ain't for kids.

MEN ARE UNDONE, AND DONE IN, BY UNDINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new entry in the Modern Library series has ``New York Novels''
as its collective title. The novels are Edith Wharton's, and they
are ``The House of Mirth,'' ``The Custom of the Country'' and ``The
Age of Innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   In the recent notorious list of the 20th century's 100 ``best''
novels as chosen by Modern Library board members, both the
unmirthful ``House of Mirth'' and the not-so-innocent ``Age of
Innocence'' were recognized, and Wharton's ``Ethan Frome'' should
have been. (The tepid explanation that ``Frome'' was ``too short''
doesn't satisfy; it's longer than George Orwell's ``Animal Farm,''
which made the cut.)
</P>
<P>
   So what of ``The Custom of the Country,'' possibly a surprise
companion to Wharton's best-known novels in the omnibus volume? I'm
delighted by its inclusion, because it's my favorite Wharton, and
not mine only.
</P>
<P>
   I do not vote a straight Edith Wharton ticket. Among her two
dozen or so novels and novellas are several gems but as many
clunkers. If she never fails in her depiction of a society, she
often misses in the matter of its individual members. Lily Bart in
``The House of Mirth'' and Ellen Olenska in ``The Age of
Innocence'' are fully realized somber heroines, and the three
tormented principal characters in ``Ethan Frome'' are masterfully
drawn. But that's almost it.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, I tried reading all of Edith Wharton all at once, and
it was heavy going. I couldn't care enough about so many of her
people. The most shining exception was and is a woman by the
unusual name of Undine Spragg, the heroine or anti-heroine of ``The
Custom of the Country.''
</P>
<P>
   Revival of interest in Wharton's fiction began in earnest, I
believe, with R.W.B. Lewis' much-honored 1975 biography of her. In
conversation with Lewis around that time, I learned that he also
rated ``The Custom of the Country'' as Wharton's strongest work. He
reasoned that the title itself was weak, less alluring than, say,
``The Age of Innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   An earlier biographer, Cynthia Wolff, reported that ``The Custom
of the Country,'' ``... superbly polished and utterly
uncompromising, has now come to be regarded by many critics as
Wharton's best work.''
</P>
<P>
   So why its comparable obscurity? The answer may lie not only in
its title but in its timing. ``The Custom of the Country'' arrived
in 1913, nine years after ``The House of Mirth'' and seven years
before ``The Age of Innocence.'' Bad-girl protagonists were not yet
in literary fashion; but the mercurial Undine Spragg anticipates
Scarlett O'Hara by almost a quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   Undine, too, is selfish and self-centered, using her dazzling
beauty to manipulate men as steppingstones to power. What she wants
is anything that would be denied her. Undine is born without
pedigree but not without cunning. She marries four times (twice to
one man) without experiencing love. One husband is her passport to
New York society; another gives her claim to a French title; and
she casually discards a husband when she becomes bored by him.
</P>
<P>
   There's a shade of difference. One believes Margaret Mitchell
finally admired born-survivor Scarlett, but one is fairly certain
that Edith Wharton detested Undine, whom she projected as a symbol
of the grasping materialism that appeared to have consumed the
world in which Wharton came of age.
</P>
<P>
   In his foreword to the $27.95 Modern Library package, Louis
Auchincloss _ himself novelist of later blueblood generations _
notes a ``distinct implication'' in the novel that Undine, for all
her beauty, is sexually cold. She is ``... the triumphant Genghis
Khan of American commercial society: the sexless female who knows
nothing and believes in nothing but holds the world strictly
accountable for her eternal disappointments.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't necessary to love or like Undine Spragg to enjoy her.
After all, fascination with a ``femme fatale'' is a custom of our

HISPANIC CAUCUS OUTLINES LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Congress inching toward adjournment, Hispanic
lawmakers on Tuesday urged the House and Senate not to slap
restrictions on bilingual education and called for clearing up the
long backlog of people waiting to become U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus also called for
disaster relief for farm laborers who have lacked work because of
severe flooding in some areas and harsh drought conditions in
others.
</P>
<P>
   Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra, D-Calif., said these issues
``must be addressed before the Latino community can say that this
Congress and this president are engaged in trying to work toward
resolving issues for the Latino community.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rubin E. Hinojosa, D-Texas, said Hispanic educational
achievement has been the lowest of any population group in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   But he said Congress has made strides in improving that record
by increasing to $28 million from $12 million money for
universities that cater to Hispanics and adding $25 million for
bilingual-education programs.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the caucus, however, said they were determined to
fend off any last-minute efforts to gut bilingual-education
programs as both houses of Congress whittle away at legislation
before heading home, possibly at the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
   The caucus also is urging that Congress grant the $171 million
President Clinton requested for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service to process citizenship requests.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., said the money would eliminate the
``atrocious'' backlog of people who are waiting to become citizens.
Gutierrez said House and Senate negotiators were considering
providing only half what the White House requested.
</P>
<P>
   There are some 1.9 million people waiting to become citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we going to do, let a million of them get through and
the other 900,000 just linger and wait and suffer?'' Gutierrez
said.
</P>
<P>
   On another immigration issue, Gutierrez asked that Salvadorans,
Guatamalans and Hondurans who are persecuted in their home
countries be granted the same amnesty protection that Nicaraguans
and Cubans received last year, instead of having to attain a higher
standard of proof of persecution.
</P>
<P>
   And he called on the federal government to grant amnesty to
300,000 to 400,000 immigrants who came to this country before 1982
but who didn't receive permission to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the greatest tragedies out there,'' Gutierrez
said, adding that these people are denied legal status in the
United States ``because some bureaucrat decided that they filed too
late... or that they left the country and didn't follow all the
rules exactly.'' Gutierrez said these people are entitled to
judicial review of ``something so critical and crucial as whether
you stay in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   On another issue, Rep. Esteban Edward Torres, D-Calif., said it
appeared that farm workers who were unable to work because of
drought and other weather conditions will likely receive $7 million
in federal disaster aid.
</P>
<P>
   However, Torres urged Congress to kill a Senate proposal that
would bring Mexican and Central-American ``guest workers'' into
this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have many farm workers who are now unemployed,'' Torres
said. ``There are ample Americans out there in need of work. This
is only a guise to bring in guest workers under inferior
conditions... The industry would rather bring people in and
underpay them or not pay them benefits.''

</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda, a
coalition of major Latino groups, released its ``congressional
scorecard'' for the 105th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The ranking showed Senate Democrats voted for issues supported
by coalition 89 percent of the time, while Republican senators
voted that way 20 percent. The scorecard was based on 11 key votes.
</P>
<P>
   The group said House Democrats voted 85 percent of the time on
24 key issues, while House Republicans voted that way 19 percent of
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and House Speaker
Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., both received scores of zero on voting for
issues of concern to the coalition, while the group said Senate
Minority Leader Thomas A. Daschle, D-S.D., voted favorably 91
percent of the time, and Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt,
D-Mo., voted favorably 75 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Senators receiving scores of 100 from the National Hispanic
Leadership Agenda were Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.; Daniel K. Akaka,
D-Hawaii; Tom Harkin, D-Iowa; Richard Durbin, D-Ill.; Carol
Moseley-Braun, D-Ill.; Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.; John F. Kerry,
D-Mass.; Paul David Wellstone, D-Minn.; Frank R. Lautenberg,
D-N.J.; and Jack Reed, D-R.I.
</P>
<P>
   House members receiving 100 percent scores were Ed Pastor,
D-Ariz.; Lois Capps, D-Calif.; Julian C. Dixon, D-Calif.; Barbara
Lee, D-Calif.; Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif.; Cynthia McKinney,
D-Ga.; Neil Abercrombie, D-Hawaii; Danny Davis, D-Ill.; Jesse
Jackson R., D-Ill.; Elijah Cummings, D-Md.; David E. Bonior,

MOTHER SUES GUN MAKER OVER TEEN'S DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JACOB H. FRIES  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Lynn Dix recently had a dream about the future:
She was taking a grandchild to a museum and pointed to one of the
exhibits, saying, ``See, they used to sell guns that allowed anyone
to shoot them, even children. That was when gun manufacturers
refused to make them safer, back when your uncle was killed.''
</P>
<P>
   That uncle, Kenzo Dix of Berkeley, died at age 15 when a friend
thought his father's unlocked handgun was empty and accidentally
killed Kenzo in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Now Lynn Dix is suing Beretta USA Corp., the maker of the 9mm
pistol that killed Kenzo, claiming the company's failure to install
an internal lock on its guns makes it liable for her son's death.
If she wins the case, her lawsuit may accomplish what years of
political lobbying could not: a climate in which gun makers must
install safety devices in their products or pay the price when
someone dies in an accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``This approach is very similar to how people took on the
tobacco industry,'' said Nancy Hersh, a lawyer representing Dix.
``This is our checks and balances at work. The courts correct where
legislators fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Dix is certainly not the first person to sue a gun manufacturer.
Cases claiming that guns are inherently dangerous and thus imply
liability for the companies that make them, have been rejected by
courts over the past two decades. Another case pending in New York
makes an even broader claim: that manufacturers ``oversupply'' the
legal gun market, so guns inevitably end up in the wrong hands.
</P>
<P>
   This case, however, is being closely watched by gun
manufacturers nationwide because it makes a very narrow and
specific claim: that built-in trigger locks were available and
known to be effective when Beretta made its pistol, so not
installing the locks is akin to selling a car without a seat belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case could have huge implications,'' said Eric Gorovitz,
legal director of The Trauma Foundation in San Francisco, another
lawyer in the case. ``If it is successful, there will probably be a
flood of lawsuits against gun manufacturers. All it takes is for
one to survive, and more will pop up.''
</P>
<P>
   About 1,500 people a year die in accidental shootings, according
to a 1991 report by General Accounting Office, the investigative
arm of Congress. Of those, the GAO estimated that a third could
have been prevented had the guns been equipped with internal locks
or indicators that the chambers were loaded with bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Dix's case hinges on product-liability law, Hersh said. Under
that law, a manufacturer is liable for injuries resulting from its
product's design _ unless it can show that the benefits of the
design outweigh its risks, she said. When Beretta made the
1992-model pistol that killed Kenzo, the manufacturer had the
ability to ``personalize'' the gun so that only the owner could
discharge the weapon after punching in a code on a miniature
built-in lock, Dix's lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a simple case of manufacturers designing an unsafe
product, knowing how to make them better and not doing it,'' Hersh
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Gebhardt, lead lawyer for Beretta, declined to comment
directly on the case, saying he did not want to influence potential
jurors.
</P>
<P>
   But court motions filed by Beretta outline their case. Beretta
argues that the design of the gun ``was not the legal cause of the
plaintiff's injuries.''

<P>
   DIXON, Ill. _ Watching classmates strut past in designer
clothes, Wendy Williams sat silently on the yellow school bus,
wearing a cheap belt and rummage-sale slacks.
</P>
<P>
   One boy stopped and yanked his thumb, demanding her seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Move it, trailer girl,'' he sneered.
</P>
<P>
   It has never been easy to live on the wrong side of the tracks.
But in the economically robust 1990s, with sprawling new houses and
three-car garages sprouting like cornstalks on the Midwestern
prairie, the sting that comes with scarcity gets rubbed with an
extra bit of salt.
</P>
<P>
   Seen through the eyes of a 13-year-old girl growing up at
Chateau Estates, a fancy name for a tin-plain trailer park, all the
rosy talk about the nation's general prosperity carries a certain
mocking echo.
</P>
<P>
   The everyday discussion in the halls of Reagan Middle School
here touches on computer toys that can cost $1,000, family
vacations to Six Flags or Disney World and designer clothes with
recognizable labels like the Nike Swoosh or Tommy Hilfiger's logo.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike young people a generation ago, those today must typically
pay fees to play sports for the school sports teams or band. It
costs $45 to play in the youth summer soccer league.It takes money
to go skating on weekends at the White Pines roller rink, to play
laser tag or rock-climb at the Plum Hollow Recreation Center, to
mount a steed at the Horseback Riding Club, to gaze at Leonardo
DiCaprio and Kate Winslet at the Plaza Cinemas, to go shopping for
clothes at Cherryvale Mall.
</P>
<P>
   To be without money, in so many ways, is to be left out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told this girl, `That's a really awesome shirt. Where did
you get it?'' said Wendy, explaining that she knew it was out of
her price range, but that she wanted to join the small talk. ``And
she looked at me and laughed and said, `Why would you want to
know?'''
</P>
<P>
   A lanky, soft-spoken girl with large brown eyes, Wendy pursed
her lips to hide a slight overbite that got her the nickname
Rabbit, a humiliation she once begged her mother and father to
avoid by sending her to an orthodontist.
</P>
<P>
   For struggling parents, keenly aware that adolescents agonize
over the social pecking order, the styles of the moment and the
face in the mirror, there is a no small sense of failure in telling
a child that she cannot have what her classmates take for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know what it's like?'' asked Wendy's mother, Veronica
Williams, ``to have your daughter come home and say, `Mom, the kids
say my clothes are tacky,' and then walk off with her head hanging
low.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the desperate poverty of Chicago housing projects,
where the plight of empty pockets is worsened by the threat of
gangs and gunfire. Wendy lives in relative safety in a home with
both parents. Her father, Wendell Provow, earns $9 an hour as a
welder. Her mother works part-time as a cook for Head Start, a
federal education program for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike students in some urban pockets, isolated from affluence,
Wendy receives the same education as girl from a $300,000 house in
the Idle Oaks subdivision. The flip side of that coin is the public
spectacle of economic struggle. This is a place small enough where
people know the personal stories, or, at least, repeat them as if
they did.
</P>
<P>
   Even in this down-to-earth town, where a poor boy nicknamed
Dutch grew up to become president, young people seem increasingly
enchanted with buying, having, spending and status.
</P>
<P>
   R. Woodrow (Woody) Wasson, the principal at Reagan Middle
School, makes it a point to sit down with every child and ask them
about their hopes and dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to be doctors, lawyers, veterinarians and, of
course, professional athletes,'' said Wasson, whose family roots
here go back to the 19th century. ``I don't remember the last time
I heard somebody say they wanted to be a police officer or a
firefighter. They want to do something that will make a lot of
money and have a lot of prestige.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a teacher in a nearby town has been trying to recruit
high school students for vocational studies to become tool-and-dye
artisans, a trade that can pay $70,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teacher can't fill the slots,'' Wasson said. ``Nobody's
interested in that kind of work.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that children grow up believing that money
is so important, given the relentless way they are targeted by
marketers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, you just put an ad in the magazine,'' said
Michael Wood, the director of research for Teenage Research
Unlimited, a marketing consultant in suburban Chicago. ``Now savvy
marketers know you must hit them at all angles _ Web sites, cable
TV shows, school functions, sporting events.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted the growth of cross-promotions, like the deal in which
actors on the television show ``Dawson's Creek,'' which is popular
among adolescents, wear clothes by J. Crew and appear in its
catalog.
</P>
<P>
   But young people get cues in their everyday lives. Some spending
habits that would once have been seen as ostentatious _ extravagant
parties for small children, new cars for teen-agers _ have become
familiar trappings of middle-class comfort.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market, although it is sputtering now, has made
millionaires of many people in Main Street towns. Building
developers here recently won approval to build a gated community,
which will be called Timber Edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wendy goes to school around these rich kids,'' her mother
said, ``and wonders why she can't have things like they do.''
</P>
<P>
   A bright girl with a flair for art, writing and numbers, Wendy
stays up late most nights, reading books.``The Miracle Worker'' was
a recent favorite.
</P>
<P>
   But when a teacher asked her to join an elevated class for
algebra, she politely declined. ``I get picked on for my clothes
and living in the trailer park,'' said Wendy, who never brings
anyone home from school. ``I don't want to get picked on for being
a nerd, too.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, who watched three other daughters drop out of school
and have babies as teen-agers, has told Wendy time and again:
``Don't lose your self-esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   One time a boy at school was teasing Wendy about her clothes _
``They don't even match,'' he laughed _ and her humble house in the
trailer park.
</P>
<P>
   She listened for a while. He kept insulting her. So she lifted a
leg _ clothed as it was in discount jeans from the Farm &AMP; Fleet
store _ and kicked him in the shins.
</P>
<P>
   He told the authorities. She got the detention.
</P>
<P>
   It became clear to Wendy that the insults were not going to
stop. It also became clear that shin-kicking, however deserved, was
not going to be the solution.
</P>
<P>
   She went to a guidance counselor, Cynthia Kowa Basler, a dynamic
woman who keeps close tabs on the children, especially girls who
fret about their weight and suddenly stop eating lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am large,'' she tells the girls, ``and I have self-esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendy, who knew that Ms. Basler held sessions with students to
increase their self-confidence, went to the counselor and asked for
help. ``I feel a little down,'' Wendy told her. The counselor
gathered a group of eight students, including other girls like
Wendy, who felt embarrassed about their economic station.
</P>
<P>
   In this school named for Ronald Reagan, the students were told
to study the words of Eleanor Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   One of her famous quotes was posted above the counselor's desk:
``Nobody can make me feel inferior without my consent.''
</P>
<P>
   As a group, the students looked up the definition of inferior
and consent.
</P>
<P>
   And then they read the words out loud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again,'' the counselor instructed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Louder,'' the counselor insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, they read the inspirational words, until they
had the words memorized.
</P>
<P>
   In role-playing exercises, the children practiced responses to
taunts, which sometimes called for nothing more than a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Basler told us to live up to our goals _ show those
kids,'' Wendy said. ``She told us that things can be a lot
different when you're grown up. Maybe things will be the other way
around then.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendy smiled at the notion.
</P>
<P>
   Life still has plenty of bumps. When Wendy gets off the school
bus _ the trailer park is the first stop, so everyone can see where
she lives _ she still looks at her shoes.
</P>
<P>
   She still pulls her shirt out to hide a belt that does not quite
make the grade. And she still purses her lips to hide an overbite.
But her mother has noticed her smiling more these days. And Wendy
has even said she might consider taking an advanced course in math,
her favorite subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go to college,'' Wendy said the other day. ``I want
to become a teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   One recent day, she popped in to see the counselor's office,
just to say hello, then walked back down the halls, her arms folded
around her schoolbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Basler stood at the doorway and watched her skip away, a
student with so much promise, and so many obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   For the girl from Chateau Estates, it is a long way from the
seventh grade to college.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's going to make it,'' the counselor said, with a clenched
fist and a voice full of hope.

   MICROSOFT-JUSTICE (Washington) Outlining its strategy for
defending its corporate practices in court, Microsoft yesterday
asserted that it is not a monopoly, blamed the Netscape
Communications Corp. for its own problems, and offered detailed
defenses of its relationships with Apple, Intel, Intuit and
Netscape. The defenses came in an unusual 40-page document offered
not in the courtroom but in a paper faxed, e-mailed and
hand-delivered to reporters and posted on the Internet. The
company's decision to offer a detailed, non-legalistic defense
illustrates the importance of public relations to the Redmond-based
software giant, which is the defendant in a much-anticipated
antitrust trial scheduled to begin here on Monday.

Clarkson also shared some thoughts about Alan Mulullay, whom he

 &HT;    PAULA JONES CASE MAY NOT GO QUIETLY INTO THE NIGHT
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the clock ticking toward their next court
date, pressure is mounting on both President Clinton and Paula
Jones to settle the sexual harassment lawsuit that spawned
Clinton's impeachment problems.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from both political parties have urged Clinton to
resolve the matter. Meanwhile, the cash-strapped Jones and her
husband, Steve, continued Tuesday to mull over an unusual set of
options, including a $700,000 offer from the president and $1
million volunteered by Abe Hirschfeld, a 79-year-old New York
parking lot tycoon who said he just wants the lawsuit to go away.
</P>
<P>
   But will it go away? Legal experts are raising questions about
whether the case will leave a trail of problems behind.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, a settlement would end prospects of a public trial
at which he would have to answer Jones's charges that he made a
lewd proposition in 1991, when she was an Arkansas state worker and
he was governor.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring in Arkansas, U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright
threw out the case. The two sides are scheduled to appear in
federal appeals court Tuesday to argue over whether the trial
should go forward.
</P>
<P>
   Still uncertain is whether a settlement could stop the next
installment of the saga of sexual allegations against Clinton.
Wright has said that documents in the Jones case, now under court
seal, would be made public on the Internet beginning Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The new material includes allegations of Clinton's extramarital
involvement with several women _ identified only as ``Jane Does'' _
during his years in Arkansas and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But it may add little to the tawdry sexual detail revealed
earlier in the impeachment referral sent to Congress by Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr, said John Whitehead, whose Rutherford
Institute has sponsored Jones's legal team. ``There's nothing even
approaching the (Monica) Lewinsky stuff,'' he said of the
descriptions of the president's relationship with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the materials include a deposition in which Clinton
denied under oath that he had a sexual relationship with Lewinsky
and also sat by as his lawyer, Robert Bennett, adamantly denied
that there had been any sexual contact whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   That could put Clinton in legal peril, said Jonathan Turley, a
law professor at George Washington University. ``The settlement of
the Jones case does not necessarily mean that the president could
not be held in contempt of court,'' he said. ``Not only did the
president lie in the deposition, but he is an officer of the court,
which places him under particularly high standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more damaging, said Turley, could be the videotape of the
Clinton deposition, which would show whether Clinton was looking
attentive when his lawyer categorically dismissed all sexual
contact with the former intern.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to settle the case, especially after the president
won in the lower court, could also leave the public impression of
admitting that he sexually harassed Jones. That's the
``conventional wisdom,'' said federal prosecutor Bruce Yannett, who
added that defendants who are not at fault sometimes make payments
simply to avoid the time and expense of a trial.
</P>
<P>
   However, Yannett said that in this case, the guilt question may
have already been settled in the public's view. ``From the polls,
it seems the public already believes something happened with Paula
Jones,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead, who recalled that few people believed Jones's story a
year ago, said that shift in public perception was a victory in
itself. Although he said he had taken a ``reality check'' and given
up on extracting a presidential apology, he would consider
Clinton's payment as a symbol of accountability, even if it comes
from a legal defense fund.
</P>
<P>
   However, Whitehead ruled out the Hirschfeld cash, even if Jones
took it, as being part of the official settlement of the case.
``It's the president who should pay it, for the simple reason that
it is a settlement with the president. It isn't a settlement with
any third party.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hirschfeld donation would almost certainly create a new flap
in the Clinton sexual saga. ``It certainly falls within a gray area
and raises obvious ethical concerns,'' Turley said, predicting that
there would be a ``chorus'' of objections that a private
businessman had, in effect, given the president the gift.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Klayman, founder of Judicial Watch, has already served
notice that his group would challenge such a transaction in court
as an illegal gratuity.

ISRAEL TELLS PALESTINIANS: NO AGREEMENT UNTIL SECURITY COMMITMENTS
ARE FULFILLED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israel on Tuesday issued a bleak forecast for
success at this week's summit with the Palestinians after two Arab
assailants killed an Israeli man and escaped to a Palestinian-ruled
area of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no agreement unless the Palestinians fulfill all
of their security commitments and in light of this depressing
picture, there is no chance at an agreement being signed at this
time,'' said a statement by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's office.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was issued hours after the police reported that
two Palestinian gunmen drove by and opened fire on two Israeli men
swimming in a pond five miles west of Jerusalem, killing one of the
swimmers. The other man was wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The assailants, driving a car with blue license plates issued to
Arab residents of the West Bank, escaped to a village near
Bethlehem, authorities said. Some reports said they later fled to
Palestinian-ruled Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   The incident, on the eve of the summit scheduled in the
Washington, D.C., area, underscored Israeli demands that
Palestinians do more to reign in their militant opposition and put
pressure on Yasser Arafat's security forces to move quickly to
catch the killers.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials had hoped that the summit would end an 18-month
impasse by clinching a deal on Israeli troop withdrawal from a
portion of the West Bank and other outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the two sides could launch negotiations on a final peace
deal and avoid the danger of violence that looms over a May 4,
1999, target date. On that day interim peace agreements expire and
most Palestinians expect Arafat to declare independence.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
there was ``no policy change'' because of the killing but that it
did not bode well for Israeli expectations of improved Palestinian
security cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a very positive thing that these guys can commit a
murder and then escape to Gaza or the West Bank without being
arrested,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Netanyahu has been demanding that the Palestinians
share more intelligence, reduce their police force, confiscate
illegal weapons and allow extradition of fugitives wanted by
Israel,according to U.S. officials who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Netanyahu's Cabinet gave the go-ahead to pull back
from 13 percent of West Bank territory if Palestinians fulfill
their commitments and acquiesce to Israel's demands for greater
cooperation on security issues.
</P>
<P>
   But the Israeli leader will go to Washington with two security
hawks, Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and Trade Minister Natan
Sharansky. Both ministers are known for their close links with
organizations that favor greater settlement in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli leader still must maneuver to please his
pro-settlement coalition partner, the National Religious Party, and
to placate hard-liners in his own Likud party. Many have threatened
to desert him in the next election if he makes what they consider a
bad deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any one _ even one _ of the 160 settlements is damaged
because of the agreement, we cannot participate in the
government,'' said Transportation Minister Shaul Yahalom, a settler
and leader of the National Religious Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 160 settlements have to be safe, have to have safe roads
(leading to them) and have territory so they can develop in the
future,`` Yahalom said.
</P>
<P>
   Following Tuesday's murder, the third in two months, some of the
most hard-line members of Netanyahu's coalition called on the prime
minister to forego the Washington-area summit.
</P>
<P>
   In August, an elderly rabbi was killed in Hebron, and just last
week, a 19-year-old female soldier was stabbed to death outside a
West Bank settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians said they suspected Netanyahu's government was
using Tuesday's killing as a pretext for inaction. They said the
Cabinet go-ahead for a troop withdrawal was carefully worded to put
the onus for the summit's success _ and blame for its failure _ on
the Palestinians, when in fact Cabinet members have no intention of
turning over more West Bank land.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are pretexts that they invent for one simple reason:
they don't want to go ahead with the peace agreement,'' said Marwan
Kanafani, an advisor to Arafat and member of the Palestinian
legislative council, or parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netanyahu is never pleased,'' Kanafani said. ``He thinks he
can always find a way to say that the Palestinians are not doing
their part.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians say their security forces are acting against
militants even, if the sentiment in the street is any judge, to the
extent that they are becoming unpopular among their own people.

COMMENTARY: THE ROAD TO LARAMIE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK RICH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the same day Americans learned last week that Matthew
Shepard, a 5-foot-2, 105-pound gay college student, had been
tortured, strung up like an animal and left to die on a fence
outside Laramie, Wyo., the Family Research Council was co-hosting a
press conference in Washington. It was the latest salvo in a
six-month campaign by the religious right, with the tacit, even
explicit, approval of Republican leaders, to demonize gay people
for political gain in this election year.
</P>
<P>
   This particular press conference was to announce a new barrage
of ads _ a TV follow-up to a summer print campaign _ in which
alleged former homosexuals who have ``changed'' implore others to
do likewise ``through the power of Jesus Christ.'' The commercials,
gooey in style, end with a slogan: ``It's not about hate ... It's
about hope.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's really about stirring up the fear that produces hate.
If these ads were truly aimed at gay people, they wouldn't be
broadcast at extravagant cost to the wide general audience reached
by TV, and they wouldn't be trumpeted in Washington, insuring free
national exposure, three weeks before Election Day. The ads
themselves, despite the sugar-coating of ``hope,'' ooze malice. In
one of them, homosexuality is linked to drug addiction and certain
death by AIDS; all of them implicitly posit that homosexuality is
itself a disease in need of a cure.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Shepard has now been ``cured,'' that's for sure. As his
uncle, R.W. Eaton, told The Denver Post, the 21-year-old Matt, who
aspired to a career in diplomacy and human rights, was ``a small
person with a big heart, mind and soul that someone tried to beat
out of him.'' Of his nephew's shattered body Eaton said, ``It's
like something you might see in war.'' And a war it is. Go to the
Family Research Council's Web site and you will find a proud
description of its readiness to ``wage the war against the
homosexual agenda and fight to maintain the traditional meaning of
`family.'''
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Family Research Council is Gary Bauer, a GOP
power broker and putative presidential candidate, who
disingenuously goes on talk shows to say that his organization
hates no one and deplores violence. But if you wage a well-financed
media air war in which people with an innate difference in sexual
orientation are ceaselessly branded as sinful and diseased and
un-American seekers of ``special rights,'' ground war will follow.
It's a story as old as history. Once any group is successfully
scapegoated as a subhuman threat to ``normal'' values by a
propaganda machine, emboldened thugs take over.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after James Byrd was savagely dragged to his death
from a pickup truck in Texas in June, I wrote a column about an
ugly incident outside the GOP state convention in Fort Worth, where
a mob threatened a group of gay Log Cabin Republicans who were
protesting discriminatory treatment by their own party. The
gay-bashers had been directly preceded by steady saber-rattling
from Republican politicians: Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma had
likened James Hormel, a gay nominee to an ambassadorship, to David
Duke; Pat Robertson had wondered on TV if God might wreak havoc on
Disney World for its ``Gay Days''; the Texas GOP spokesman had
likened Log Cabin to the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   Just two days after this near-brush with violence in Fort Worth,
Trent Lott was on TV seconding the religious right's condemnation
of gay people as sinful and sick. A frightened gay Texas Republican
who had been at the convention melee asked when I interviewed him
then: ``Do you have to have someone hurt and beat up and dragged
from a truck to stop this?''
</P>
<P>
   Months later not even the murder in Laramie has moved Lott to
apologize for his words, and still no major GOP leader dares take
on its ``religious'' wing and its crusade against people like
Matthew Shepard.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the new ads in that supposedly hate-free crusade, an
ostensibly loving mother condemns her son for the ``bad choice'' of
being gay. Is it that mother who speaks for American values, or is
it Matthew's? ``Go home, give your kids a hug,'' Judy Shepard said
in a message read by a tearful hospital spokesman who announced her
child's death early Monday morning, ``and don't let a day go by
without telling them you love them.''

   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip _ The grandly named Gaza Industrial
Estate, an unprepossessing 120-acre collection of vacant factory
sheds and water towers rising from the ragged flatlands east of
Gaza City, is an unlikely focus for the highly charged, high-stakes
Middle East peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Fenced off from potential markets by the barbed wire of the
Israeli border, the park has been ready for business for nearly a
year. But security-conscious Israeli officials had been unwilling
to guarantee the unimpeded flow of goods that an industrial park
needs to attract and sustain investment.
</P>
<P>
   Now, hailed by all sides as the first tangible achievement of
the current phase of the tortuous Israeli-Palestinian negotiating
process, the Gaza Industrial Estate is expected to be operating
before the end of the year. It will employ up to a thousand
Palestinians, and eventually more, in several small-scale
manufacturing ventures.
</P>
<P>
   What was hailed in Gaza as a diplomatic and economic
breakthrough would almost anywhere else in the world be an
unexceptional, small step in industrial development.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is a measure of the Gaza Strip's isolation and
economic desperation that this tentative, modest project looms so
large for Palestinian planners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very, very important,'' said Abdel Rahman Naim, head
of the Gaza office of the Palestinian Directorate for Free Zones
and Industrial Parks, part of the Palestinian Authority. ``This
will be the first concrete outcome of these negotiations, the first
project with real benefits for people here.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Gaza project has been embraced by Israeli
officials eager to demonstrate some visible progress and
flexibility in the talks. ``Karni seems like a little item on the
agenda, but it can have great ramifications,'' said Israeli Trade
and Industry Minister Natan Sharansky, using the Israeli name for
the border crossing known to Palestinians as Montar.
</P>
<P>
   Opening the park for business has also been a key short-term
goal of U.S. mediators, who are acutely aware of the steady
economic deterioration here since the signing of the Oslo accords
between Israel and the Palestinians five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has pledged some $6 million for items like a
water treatment plant on the Palestinian side and the improvement
of Israeli border inspection sites.
</P>
<P>
   Gaza now has little to offer a labor force that expands by an
extraordinary 5 percent yearly, propelled by what for 15 years has
been the highest recorded birth rate in the world. Emigration from
Gaza to Israel or to Palestinian areas in the West Bank is
forbidden by the Israeli authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Depression-scale unemployment _ averaging 37 percent last year,
the United Nations has reported _ is worsened by Israeli denials of
daily work visas for the 25,000 Gaza laborers who are authorized to
cross the border for jobs in construction and agriculture. Israel
cites security as the reason for the visa denials.
</P>
<P>
   As they concluded talks in Jerusalem and Gaza in recent days in
preparation for the coming round of peace negotiations in Maryland,
U.S. officials said optimistically that they anticipated 17 initial
private investors and an eventual 40,000 workers at the park, a
figure equivalent to a fifth of the current Gaza labor force.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians managing the project are more cautious,
reporting that they have received a dozen serious proposals _ one
from an Israeli company, the rest from Palestinians _ for projects
ranging from garment making to the manufacture of steel security
doors.
</P>
<P>
   If all of the projects go forward, they say, the park will
employ about 3,000 people within 18 months and as many as 20,000
within five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an industrial zone, this is very small,'' acknowledged Awni
Abdul-Rahim, the general manager of the Palestinian Industrial
Estates Development Co., or Piedco, the local company running the
park.
</P>
<P>
   And its economic viability, he added, is contingent on the
cooperation of Israeli customs and security officials, who will
ultimately control access. ``Everything depends on Israel,''
Abdul-Rahim said.
</P>
<P>
   Gaza's exports are routinely obstructed by border closings and
security checks, further skewing a chronic trade imbalance. For
every five trucks that arrive here from Israel, only one goes out,
and it typically goes out very slowly.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon at the border checkpoint next to the
industrial park, six Israeli customs inspectors examined a
truckload of Gaza potatoes for hours, pallet by pallet, bag by bag,
with hand-held metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
   American advisers hope to smooth these bottlenecks with
computerized scanners, bonded inspections and other high-tech
customs systems developed for the border between the United States
and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want it to be a successful business it cannot be
interrupted,'' Sharansky said. ``Yet one of the biggest explosions
of the last year in Tel Aviv started with a truck from Gaza, so we
can't take the security issue lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   While the agreement to open the industrial zone is being
trumpeted by U.S. diplomats as a done deal, Palestinians and
Israelis are still haggling over legal and technical details and,
perhaps more important from the Palestinian viewpoint, how it is
portrayed in an eventual peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian Industrial Estates Development Co., which says
it is investing $10 million in the industrial park, is controlled
by the powerful Masri clan from Nablus in the West Bank. The
Palestinian Authority, which has leased the land for 49 years, will
receive 10 percent of Piedco's profits, Abdul-Rahim said.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians acknowledge that their ultimate goal is to
attract Israeli joint ventures, both for immediate business reasons
_ Palestinian industry ``is weak on marketing,'' Naim said _ and as
a long-term survival strategy.
</P>
<P>
   A precondition for any Palestinian export venture is secure
access through Israel to other foreign markets, and the
Palestinians hope to build an allied constituency of Israeli
industrialists equally dependent on open borders.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials, some of whom once preached socialist
self-sufficiency, promise a laissez-faire paradise for prospective
export manufacturers. They say there will be no corporate taxes,
minimal regulatory oversight and workers who will earn $300 to $400
a month, the prevailing unskilled pay rate within Gaza but about
half of what Palestinians earn in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no interference from government or from
unions,'' Naim said.

DEBATE OVER MARRIAGE EDUCATION FOR HIGH-SCHOOL STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Pa.)   (bl)  
 By TAMAR LEWIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As conservatives and liberals alike have come to agree on the
importance of marriage and the need to strengthen families, a
growing number of high schools across the country are requiring
students to undergo marriage education.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1, Florida will become the first state to require all
public high schools to teach marriage and relationship skills, such
as how to resolve conflicts. In other states, hundreds of
individual schools and school districts are adding classes _ some a
semester long, some a two-week unit within another course _ to
teach students the skills to make marriage work and avoid divorce.
</P>
<P>
   The movement to teach relationship skills, however, is only part
of a growing debate over what, and where, American children should
be taught about love and marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Given the nation's high divorce rates, some educators and social
policy analysts say, schools have an obligation to help students
think not only about relationships, but also about the role that
marriage has played in history and the deeper human issues of love,
intimacy and commitment.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no consensus on what should be taught: some see the
courses as an introduction to premarital counseling, while others
want character education or teaching on divorce law.
</P>
<P>
   Others question the whole concept of marriage education in the
schools, arguing that it is an area best left to churches and
community groups and reserved for adults in a relationship _ not
high-school students working through a crowded curriculum that too
often fails to cover basic academic skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have schools that can't teach reading, writing and
arithmetic,'' said Midge Decter, the conservative writer. ``The
idea that schools should even be touching this chills my blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the programs believe they can teach young people
how to avoid divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't rocket science; it's more like driver's ed,'' said
Diane Sollee, whose experience as a marriage counselor led her to
found the Coalition for Marriage, Family and Couples Education, a
group that promotes schools' teaching of marriage skills. ``It's
about teaching kids the basic communication skills they need for a
healthy marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in marriages that succeed fight about all the same
things as people in marriages that fail,'' she said. ``The research
shows that what distinguishes them is how they handle their
disagreements. That's a skill we can teach.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the marriage-skills programs are so new, there is no
research on whether they actually prevent divorce.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But some students seem to feel that they fill a need.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, 19 students at Martin Luther King High School,
mostly seniors, enrolled in this semester's elective
marriage-skills class, which is based on a curriculum developed by
the family law section of the American Bar Association and is now
in use in more than 400 schools. Only four lived with two married
parents, and most said they hoped the course _ alternating
discussion of divorce law and domestic violence with exercises in
budgeting and conflict resolution _ would help them avoid their
parents' mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents broke up when I was 2,'' said Marcus Wright, an
18-year old senior in the class, which is sponsored by, and mostly
taught at, Wolf, Block, Schorr &AMP; Solis-Cohen, a local law firm.
``I'm taking this course because I want to get married, and I don't
want to break up.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, most high schools discuss marriage as one part of a
health or ``life skills'' class giving practical information on
everything from nutrition and balancing a checkbook to AIDS
prevention and first aid.
</P>
<P>
   Many districts have chosen the health model as the best way to
avoid controversy in an era when teaching about sexuality or values
can cause school-board headaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The left is afraid that schools are going to be used for
religious indoctrination, and the right is afraid they'll push
liberal views, so the public-school textbooks describe everything
as if it's plumbing, which makes it safe, but doesn't help the
children,'' said Amitai Etzioni, a professor at George Washington
University who writes frequently on the need for moral education.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear just what will be in the curriculum in
Florida, where it was a liberal Democrat, state Rep. Elaine Bloom,
who pushed the legislation requiring marriage-skills education,
with backing from some conservative groups, including the local
Christian Coalition. Nationally, though, many conservatives say
that home, church and community organizations are the places to
talk about marriage, not the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Institute for American Values, a nonpartisan
group concerned with family issues, issued a study critical of the
most commonly used textbooks. The study analyzed the six textbooks,
published from 1993 to 1997 and used in the 20 states that have
adopted specific health texts, and concluded that they generally
avoided discussion of love, religion, commitment, values and
spirituality, and focused strongly on self-esteem and
self-actualization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the big, interesting words _ mystery, romance, love
flirtation, jealousy, courtship, passion _ are simply left
unexamined, as if they were not relevant,'' the report stated,
``replaced instead by smaller and ultimately sadder words such as
dysfunction, self-esteem, responsibility, stress, coping, disease,
and, most of all, health.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It questioned whether marriage was appropriately a chapter
sandwiched between ``Mental Disorders and Suicide'' and ``Digestion
and Excretion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The textbooks emphasize the health-benefit aspect, as if the
question about marriage is, what am I going to get for it,'' said
Paul Vitz of New York University, the author of the report. ``That
me-generation psychology is incompatible with successful marriages
and families, which require love and self-sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   His report quoted one of the texts that says, ``The most
important relationship in your life is the relationship you have
with yourself,'' and another that has 31 pages on self-esteem and
seven on marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute for American Values report included three
recommendations for improving marriage education: use examples from
literature and art, shift the emphasis from health to character,
and, if health textbooks are to be used, make sure they recognize
the religious and sociological perspectives on marriage, and
incorporate material from marriage-skills research.
</P>
<P>
   Some see the textbooks as a sign of the times, a reflection of
how sexual liberation has been accompanied by an odd revaluing, in
which graphic sexual talk has become a staple of public affairs
while intense emotions have come to be seen as unseemly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Victorians could not discuss the shape of a piano leg
without blushing, but they could describe fervent, almost
religious, passion for a friend,'' said Kay S. Hymowitz, a
contributing writer to the conservative Manhattan Institute. ``Now,
we talk with strangers about pubic hair, but if we talk about love,
we turn red with shame. The idea of belonging to someone else
threatens contemporary values, which have to do with being tough,
being independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say where kids would learn the cultural construct
of romantic love,'' she said. ``It's not in the school curriculum.
It's not in rap music. On many campuses, there is no such thing as
dating anymore. And when parents talk about what they say to their
adolescents, you hear about responsibility, about saying what you
mean, but you never hear about love.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the new marriage-education programs now trickling into
high schools still tend to focus on practical skills like conflict
resolution, but one popular program, ``The Art of Loving Well,''
developed at Boston University, uses an anthology of literary
selections to spur discussion of love, loss, romance, commitment
and marriage.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Connections,'' a 15-lesson curriculum now used in several
hundred schools, mostly in California, students choose a partner
for a pretend marriage, and meet for seven days to divide household
duties, plan a wedding, make career choices, create a budget, plan
a family vacation and face a randomly-assigned crisis, like being
dismissed from a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game comes after they've gone through lessons on
understanding themselves, relationships, and communications, and
they really get a chance to work through problems,'' said Kay Reed,
of the Berkeley, Calif., Dibble Fund, created by a philanthropist
concerned about divorce rates, which distributes the curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people choose a boyfriend or girlfriend to work with,
some people a friend of the same sex,'' she said. ``In one class,
after the quarterback on the football team chose a girl as his
partner, the girl, who wasn't in the class, came in to tell the
teacher she would never even think about marrying him because he
just didn't listen to her.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of teaching relationship skills in high school has
trickled down from the adult world in the last few years, as
educators, therapists, divorce lawyers, family court judges and
legislators have become familiar with adult marriage-skills
courses. Since several states have rejected legislation to require
skills counseling for everyone married, some supporters of marriage
education now see the high schools as an easier place to spread the
word.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, this is America, and we're not going to force
people into counseling,'' said Ms. Sollee. ``In high school, it's
clearer that this isn't therapy, it's learning skills.''
</P>
<P>
   And in Florida, at least, the high-school curriculum is only
part of a larger marriage-skills effort, including a discount on
marriage licenses for couples that take a four-hour skills course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our legislation is about skills that will help children in all
their relationships: with their parents, their peers, their
brothers and sisters, and ultimately with choosing and staying with
their mate,'' said Representative Bloom.
</P>
<P>
   But even some proponents of marriage-skills courses for adults
question whether they belong in high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are plenty of community settings or religious settings
for learning relationship skills,'' said Howard Markman, of the
University of Denver's Center for Marital and Family Studies, who
teaches adult marriage-skills courses. ``I think relationship
skills need to be developed in the context of the relationship, and
trying to reach kids in schools may be too early.''
</P>
<P>
   An exchange last month at a New York City symposium sponsored by
the Institute for American Values encapsulated the debate over the
schools' role: ``A lot of these kids don't know who Abraham Lincoln
is,'' said Ms. Decter, arguing for a traditional academic
curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't need to know who Abraham Lincoln is to stay
married,'' retorted Ms. Sollee.

REPORT EXPLORES SERIOUS GENDER GAP IN TECHNOLOGY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By TAMAR LEWIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although high school girls have been catching up to boys in math
and science achievement over the last six years, there is a serious
gender gap in technology, according to the latest report on girls'
education by the American Association of University Women
Educational Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The report, ``Gender Gaps: Where Schools Still Fail Our
Children,'' found, for example, that in 1996 girls made up only 17
percent of the high school students who took that advanced
placement computer science exam, about the same percentage as in
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there are more girls taking computer classes, they tend
to be in data entry, while boys are more likely to take advanced
computer applications that can lead them to careers in
technology,'' said Janice Weinman, executive director of the
association.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's not just what courses they take,'' Ms. Weinman said.
``What we've learned through the studies is that girls feel much
less comfortable with technology than boys, that they see computers
primarily as a matter of word processing rather than as an
opportunity for a different kind of problem solving.''
</P>
<P>
   The association's 1992 report, ``How Schools Shortchange
Girls,'' which found that girls were often ignored in the classroom
and neglected in the curriculum, and generated a nationwide debate
on gender equity in education. But that report also came under fire
for its failure to address the overall cultural and educational
issues that left boys receiving lower grades, dropping out of high
school and underperforming girls in English, social studies and
foreign languages.
</P>
<P>
   The new report rejects the view of boys as advantaged top
performers and girls as victims who need to catch up. It argues
that true gender equity would benefit all students, giving both
sexes encouragement to excel in every subject area.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the report focuses mostly on girls' progress. For
example, it found good news in girls' increased presence in
advanced mathematics and science classes. In 1990, boys made up a
higher percentage of pre-calculus, trigonometry, statistics and
calculus classes, while in 1994 there was an equal, or higher,
percentage of girls in all those classes except calculus; and even
in calculus, the gap had narrowed. In science, girls are
predominant in every subject except physics, and that gap, too, is
narrowing.
</P>
<P>
   But it does little to resolve a basic conundrum in the debate
about gender equity. Even in areas where girls historically
outperform boys, they tend to get lower scores on standardized
tests like the Advanced Placement Exams, Scholastic Assessment
Tests and Preliminary Scholastic Assessment Tests, which play a
large role in determining merit scholarships and college entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the report found, boys do better on multiple-choice
questions and girls on essays. And, with the addition of an essay
question on the PSAT in 1997, girls' overall score was just 2.7
points lower than that of boys, compared to a gap of 4.5 points the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we see what the writing sample does on the PSAT, I
think that clearly needs to be addressed on the SAT,'' Ms. Weinman
said.

   NEW YORK _ The excitement stops right after the metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
   That's what you have to pass through, as though you were heading
for an airport departure lounge, to join the audience for ``Corpus
Christi,'' Terrence McNally's new play at the Manhattan Theater
Club. There's a parcel-scanning X-ray machine, too, presumably on
the lookout for weaponry. There was, on the night I attended, the
momentary frisson of the gnarled, desperate-looking man with the
thick glasses demanding a last-minute ticket. And once you've taken
your seat, you can ponder the impressive program insert, signed by
hundreds of American artists and arts administrators, with its
brief but resounding statement in support of ``full and diverse
artistic expression.''
</P>
<P>
   That's pretty much it for pulse-quickening drama. The play that
brought an outraged chorus of protest even before it went into
rehearsal is about as threatening, and stimulating, as a glass of
chocolate milk. The debates triggered by this latest effort from
McNally, author of the warmly received ``Master Class'' and ``Love!
Valour! Compassion!,'' are of urgent importance; the play, on its
own terms, simply is not.
</P>
<P>
   You have probably already heard of ``Corpus Christi,'' which has
been making headlines since last spring. That was when word of the
content of the play, which presents a Christlike hero as a gay man,
was leaked to Roman Catholic rights groups, which responded loudly
and angrily. There were also anonymous threats of violence, and the
production was canceled. Then there were threats from playwrights
to boycott the Manhattan Theater Club for what they saw as its
moral cowardice, and the production was reinstated. There have been
protesters outside the theater since the work went into previews.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``Corpus Christi,'' which is directed by Joe Mantello, is
hardly blistering satire of any sort, much less a festival of
``Catholic bashing,'' as it was accused of being. As a piece of
baldfaced impiety, the Monty Python movie ``The Life of Brian''
outstrips it by miles. As a daring reconceptualization, the rock
opera ``Jesus Christ Superstar,'' which portrayed its title
character in the context of contemporary celebrity, was far more
startling. Actually, the show that most readily comes to mind is
the 1971 musical ``Godspell.''
</P>
<P>
   That, as you may recall, was a story-theater presentation of the
life of Christ. It was enacted by young performers who emphasized
the ``peace and love'' aspect of their flower-child personas,
making the implicit argument that not all hippies are like Charles
Manson. The show has since become a staple among church and high
school performance groups throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corpus Christi,'' it's true, is unlikely to be staged in
church basements anytime soon. It has its share of four-letter
words, portraits of sadistic parochial schoolteachers (a priest and
a nun) and a couple of evocations of rough and nasty sex (which
here seems to be the exclusive province of heterosexuals). There
are also many instances of the threadbare religious humor common to
college revues. (The pregnant Mary to Joseph: ``I'm a virgin,
Joe.'' Joseph: ``Nobody knows that better than I do.'')
</P>
<P>
   But from the moment you first see the cast of 13 young men
milling around the stage as their audience files in, the play's
willfully nonthreatening tone is apparent. These are guys who, with
a little tonsorial assistance, could all be working at Disney
World. They are fresh-faced and polite; they smile a lot and would
probably hug you, in a noncarnal way, if you asked. They are only
actors telling ``an old and familiar story,'' as one of them puts
it in his opening remarks, in their own way. There are, he adds,
``no tricks up our sleeves, no malice in our hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to emphasize purity of intention, the stage is a raised
wooden platform floating amid exposed walls and lighting equipment.
(The designer is Loy Arcenas.) In the opening scene, the performers
are baptized into being, given names, characters and a sprinkle of
water by the actor Michael Irby, whose name in the play is of
course John and who tells each of the newly christened, ``I bless
you and I baptize you and I recognize your divinity as a human
being.''
</P>
<P>
   The human beings proceed to explain their roles in the evening.
The chief characters are indeed gay variations on Christ and his
Twelve Apostles. (Jesus is here named Joshua and played by the
puppy-eyed Anson Mount.) It should be noted that there is not a
screaming queen or sneering leather boy among them. The apostle who
is a hairdresser brings to mind a college football star; the
hustler has an angel's face. More conventional professions _
doctor, lawyer, architect _ are well represented. These are
obviously just folks, only a little more photogenic and a lot nicer
than most of the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   The plot summoned into being by the agile company members, most
of whom play multiple roles, is indeed familiar. The outline
doesn't diverge much from basic biblical lore. The Nativity, the
Sermon on the Mount, the Last Supper are all duly represented here,
with the inevitable, relevancy-making substitutions.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua is born in a motel room and grows up in Corpus Christi,
Texas (also the home town of McNally), where he is persecuted by
teachers and schoolmates for being different. He moves to a big
city and recruits his corps of disciples, including his high school
sweetheart, Judas (Josh Lucas). Joshua performs the expected
miracles and spreads his gospel of affirmation, summed up in the
credo ``God loves us most when we love each other.'' When he
returns to Corpus Christi, he is betrayed by Judas to ``the fag
haters in priests' robes'' and crucified to the jeers of those who
made fun of him as a boy.
</P>
<P>
   This is all set forth with the fluid grace one expects from
Mantello, even though the actors are unable to transcend their
positions as peaceful ambassadors from Gay Land. There are
occasional flashes of original wit in McNally's use of Scripture.
After Joshua strikes a hypocritical priest, an apostle points out
that he had previously advised them to turn the other cheek. ``I
must have been in a very good mood,'' Joshua responds. ``Do not
take everything I say so seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most lines in ``Corpus Christi'' that touch on anything
mildly provocative (in this case, contradictions in Christian
teaching), this one evaporates as soon as it is uttered.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   McNally has Joshua intriguingly say more than once that, ``You
can come no closer to me than my body. Everything important is
hidden from you.'' The lines have echoes of McNally's more fully
developed works, plays like ``Lips Together, Teeth Apart,'' which
ruefully consider the limits of people's understanding of each
other.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as a piece of writing, ``Corpus Christi'' feels lazy. It
rides piggyback on the mighty resonances guaranteed by the story
that inspired it, and rarely reaches beyond the easy novelty of
making its central character gay, with such attendant scenes as a
wedding of two men.
</P>
<P>
   The central and inarguably worthy message is that no one should
be persecuted for being different. That the message is still
tragically in need of reiteration is evidenced by the death last
week of a gay student in Wyoming who had been tortured and beaten
by two other young men.
</P>
<P>
   But who, finally, is ``Corpus Christi'' preaching to? Most
regular theatergoers will find it flat and simple-minded, and those
on the hunt for signs of sacrilege and homosexual conspiracy are
unlikely to overcome their resistance. There is no avoiding the
conclusion that ``Corpus Christi'' is a minor work from a major
playwright that probably would have come and gone quietly had it
not been for its early and vociferous opponents. As it is, it is
saddled with a weight that its stick-figure shoulders cannot
support.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOMFIELD, Colo. _ While the election in three weeks has been
portrayed in Washington as a referendum on whether President
Clinton should be impeached, the scandal has not become a central
part of the discourse _ or the candidates' strategies _ in the
closest House and Senate contests in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, polls showing a backlash against the Republican
Congress have led many Republicans to stop touting the Clinton
scandal as a plus for their campaigns. No Republican House
candidate is currently running a commercial that mentions the
scandal, as a handful did only weeks ago, according to party
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as Democrats pore over the polls, searching for ways to
capitalize on the unexpected turn, there is silence in their party
as well. Most Democrats said they were still uneasy about seizing
on the Lewinsky matter because _ backlash or not _ many voters seem
to want it to go away.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in an election year of uncertainty and unpredictability,
the aversion to bringing up the scandal could change overnight.
Many Democrats, especially those trying to dislodge Republican
incumbents, are wondering whether to close their campaigns with
commercials that ridicule the Republicans' vote for an open-ended
impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, at least, an examination of competitive races found
that at campaign stops, voters rarely mentioned the scandal. The
topic is not surfacing much at candidates' forums (except for a
throwaway question here and there). And beyond long-shot candidates
who are trying to attract attention, most campaigns have refrained
from turning Clinton's troubles into fodder for commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Here on the front range of the Rockies, the contest for the seat
left open by the retirement of Rep. David Skaggs, a Democrat, in
Colorado's 2nd District is viewed by both parties as one of the 10
closest in the nation. But even as the candidates search furiously
for ammunition that will give them an edge in a race that polls
show is a dead heat, both have steered clear of the scandal that
has unnerved Washington for nine months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's been walking a high wire on this,'' said Mark
Udall, a state representative and mountain climbing enthusiast who
is the Democratic nominee, explaining that he had no intention of
attacking Republicans for prolonging the impeachment inquiry.
``Trying to capitalize on it is a very risky strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   His Republican opponent, Robert Greenlee, a self-made
millionaire business executive and former mayor of Boulder _ the
district's largest city _ predicted he's going to win ``because I
have the right message.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's better than making my way to Washington on the sorrow
and disgust that surrounds what the president did,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenlee said his biggest fear was that Democrats in this swing
district would rush to the polls out of fury at the Republican
Congress. ``It might begin to look like partisan piling on,'' he
said. ``I was in Washington the week the Starr report was released.
My first thought was, `I hope members of my party don't overplay
it.' I still feel that way.''
</P>
<P>
   With candidates avoiding the scandal, in district after
district, they are using the same campaign themes that they first
raised in January, before they or the nation had heard of Monica
Lewinsky: education, taxes, health care and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   In another neck-and-neck House race for an open seat, Oregon's
1st District north and west of downtown Portland, the candidates
are so wary of the White House scandal that they offered virtually
identical, and measured, comments. Molly Bordonaro, the Republican
nominee, said the impeachment proceedings should be handled in a
``fair and measured'' fashion. Her Democratic opponent, David Wu,
said they should be handled in a ``measured, fair and expeditious''
manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole Clinton thing is something you can't assess,'' said
John Easton, Ms. Bordonaro's campaign manager. ``It's an unknown
you can't factor into your campaign strategy. It would be dangerous
to do so because it could break against you.''
</P>
<P>
   In Mississippi's 4th District, which stretches from Jackson to
the Louisiana state line, Delbert Hosemann, the Republican nominee,
has tried to portray his opponent, Ronnie Shows, as a liberal.
Shows has campaigned as a conservative Democrat. Neither has said
much about the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   They may be reflecting the sentiment of many voters in the
district who said in interviews that they were simply tired of
hearing about Clinton's transgressions. ``I think they ought to get
a firing squad and clean out some of it,'' Joseph Cato, a shoestore
owner in the district who plans to vote Republican, said of the
troubles in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In another fiercely competitive House race, in Wisconsin's 2nd
District, which includes Madison, candidates have focused on health
insurance, Social Security, taxes and spending. Tammy Baldwin, a
Democrat who is running for the seat against Josephine Musser, a
Republican, said voters mention the presidential scandal ``only to
the extent that they want to express frustration that it has
deflected so much of the nation's attention and so much of
Congress' attention.''
</P>
<P>
   But like candidates around the country, Ms. Musser complained
that the intrusiveness of the scandal made it difficult for the
campaign to gain momentum. ``The media in particular are very taken
with the scandal,'' she said. ``And something new comes every day
out of Washington and so each day we have to address the new vote
or the new report or the new statement.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Back here in Colorado, at a candidates' forum in Denver taped
Tuesday night, the scandal in Washington never came up. At six
forums attended by Greenlee and Udall so far, only one questioner
has raised the scandal. That was at an event on the day last week
when the House voted to move ahead with an impeachment inquiry; the
candidates were asked how they would have voted. (Each said he
would have supported his party's proposal for an inquiry.)
</P>
<P>
   One thing that both candidates in this race seem to agree on is
that the outcome will be decided by the so-called unaffiliated or
independent voters, a group that outnumbers registered Democrats
and Republicans. That is why the contenders have concentrated their
efforts in rapidly-growing suburban middle-class areas like
Broomfield, east of Boulder and more conservative than much of
Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   As he campaigned door-to-door in Broomfield on Monday evening,
Udall did not once raise the Clinton scandal, and no voters
mentioned the scandal on their own. They were mostly interested in
topics like education and traffic congestion. Yet the scandal
seemed to fester just below the surface: When prospective voters
were asked about the matter by a reporter who accompanied Udall,
one after another, people of all political stripes, burst forth
with strong comments _ and reserved their harshest judgments for
members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Eichner, a 54-year-old letter carrier, said he was not
affiliated with one party or another and that he did not know Udall
was a Democrat. But when asked about the scandal after the
candidate approached him, Eichner made himself clear: ``No
Republican is going to get my vote because they're the ones trying
to keep this thing stirred up!''
</P>
<P>
   Up the street, Russell Warmack, 71, a retired phone company
worker, had a Greenlee sign in his front yard. Udall knocked on his
door anyway, only to be informed by Warmack that he was ``a
dyed-in-the-wool-Republican.'' But asked about the scandal, Warmack
lashed out against lawmakers in his own party. ``I wish they'd get
through with this thing,'' he said. ``It's trivial. Who cares about
sex?''
</P>
<P>
   Then, after calling the president a liar, Warmack pointed to
Udall and said, ``You I can probably trust.''
</P>
<P>
   That may explain why on a wall in his campaign headquarters
Udall, whose father, Morris, was a congressman and presidential
candidate, displays an autographed photograph of himself shaking
hands with Clinton. But the photograph is no where to be found in
Udall's campaign literature.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? Udall chuckled at the question and said: ``This is a
local race. The president is not on peoples' minds.''

<P>
   PARIS _ The only vision more disturbing than the Goth panorama
that Olivier Theyskens displayed in his spectacular show Monday was
the suggestion of the return of wasp waists and full skirts a la
Dior. And where else were backward-looking fashions like these
shown? In the Dior salon on the Avenue Montaigne, of course, in
blazing yellow suits with skirts held girlishly aloft by horse-hair
linings.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, for the first time since he took over the reins at
Dior two years ago, John Galliano presented the collection there.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who thought the appearance of full skirts, in the very
place where Dior championed them, would make for a poignant moment
was disappointed. But one thing is clear: Galliano, to his
everlasting credit, has totally made his bed in Dior's house and
given it his own strong imprint.
</P>
<P>
   And if these suits were the oddest expression in a discordant
show, it is because the New Look looks old.
</P>
<P>
   One can hardly imagine them on the two older,
distinguished-looking women dressed in furs watching the show, who
thanks to some obvious help looked as if they are the same age now
as they were when Dior introduced the New Look in 1947. Nor can one
imagine them on new young Dior clients like Gwyneth Paltrow _ who
attended the show with Ben Affleck _ dressed in a pretty Dior
seafoam turtleneck and long, hip-hugging skirt.
</P>
<P>
   What was significant was the abundance of day clothes. Among the
best were familiar swashbuckling black jackets over black lacquered
knit tube skirts and olive knit tops and dresses. There were
water-washed chiffon gowns with Cubist prints, like the art of
Sonia Delauney. Galliano, who has often been criticized for his
lack of day clothes for Dior, was making amends.
</P>
<P>
   But every artist who strains under the yoke of constriction
eventually rebels. Surely that was the point of the dissonant
interlude of barefoot blond nymphets in plain white dresses. If
fashion really wants another pedestrian designer, Galliano seemed
to be saying facetiously that he can do it easily.
</P>
<P>
   Polls say that most Americans, particularly women and members of
minority groups, support President Clinton because they fear the
alternative of the radical right. And the rise of religion and
religious conservatism is evident in fashion's dalliance with the
1950s. But designers ought to fear from submersion in the '50s,
which began last season with a penchant for gray, for knee-length
skirts, for sweater sets and for smiling, sun-kissed fashion
advertisements. The ultimate regression would be the New Look, a
reminder of a repressive time socially and an artless moment in
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   There is hope, however. Not everyone in Paris was invoking Dior.
Most optimistically, Marc Jacobs, who was once a flag bearer for
the conservatism trend, banished it from his show for Louis
Vuitton. His presentation Monday was the first important show of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Having proved he can design a skirt and sweater set, Jacobs
reminded his audience with this Vuitton collection that he is also
a world-class talent. The assured, easy hand at work in the show
appeared in limpid hooded ponchos worn high in the front and low in
the back, over hot pants styled like trousers. Jacobs added
sophisticated details to every piece: a double-face wool jacket
with zippered bracelet sleeves, a cotton and cashmere sweater with
slit pockets like a flat kangaroo pouch, and blouses curved over
the shoulder with tiny darts.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs possesses all the ingredients to be among the handful of
American designers who years from now will replace Ralph Lauren and
those of his generation. Jacobs has already proved he can set
trends. He has design talent; a stylist's eye; commercial savvy;
innovative ideas; a strong right arm and protector in his business
partner, Robert Duffy, and at last a deep-pocketed French backer.
And besides, Jacobs, who once posed nearly naked in Vanity Fair, is
handsome.

</P>
<P>
   In an industry that practically invented the word ``image,''
it's surprising how infrequently people publicly acknowledge the
vitalness of a designer's image to his success.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, within a breath of mentioning Theyskens' walloping
designs, the audience's chit-chat turned to how appealing the
long-haired Theyskens looked as he walked down the runway for the
traditional bow.
</P>
<P>
   Theyskens has Madonna to thank for introducing him to the world
even before he had a business. The singer and actress wore his
sweeping Gothic jacket to the Academy Award ceremonies in March.
Like Madonna that night, or perhaps more like Bette Davis in ``Hush
. . . Hush, Sweet Charlotte,'' there is something weirdly
mesmerizing about Theyskens' collection. Arianna Phillips, the
stylist who introduced his clothes to Madonna and who was also at
the Versace show last week dressing Courtney Love, was in the front
row at the show.
</P>
<P>
   In this, his first season of selling to the public, Theyskens
offered not only an ode to Dior, with full-cut dresses and coats,
but a paean to macabre women, with tight pink leather leggings and
the sharpest of high heels. Then came black leather skirts over
leather leggings, with leather shrugs that encased the shoulders
and bared the breasts.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Belgium, Theyskens is of a school of new designers,
including Raf Simons, who see the world as a dark Gothic place.
Their references are more the knife-point shoulders and harsh view
of early Alexander McQueen than the populist romanticism of
Galliano.
</P>
<P>
   Within 10 minutes of the ending of Theysken's show, executives
from Barneys New York, not known to be the most populist of stores,
raced backstage to tie up the collection exclusively for New York
and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Theyskens presented his collection with the sense of theater
that McQueen and Galliano usually bring to their shows. In a less
complicated way, Dries van Noten used the art of presentation to
add dimension to his simple collection. He turned Salle Wagram, a
popular space for Paris shows, into a dimly lighted cavern dotted
with ominous black trees and foliage. Every chair _ there were
hundreds _ was painted an austere black, as if a giant oil slick
had rolled through the room.
</P>
<P>
   Against this starkness, there were pure and innocent cotton slip
dresses, some with ruche bodices, others with buttons down the
front or gentle folds and drapes adorning the hips. The innocence
gave way to black slips and jackets, some with dangling belts that
resembled glistening fishermen's nets with mollusc shells.
</P>
<P>
   Would van Noten's collection have been any less without its
artistic setting? And would Galliano's have been any more had he
followed his custom and set his clothes within a play? Designers
who go to great trouble to create a set for their clothes are
acknowledging the connection between art and fashion. There is a
lot of discussion about that link here in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly the magazine I.D. is running a feature this month on
the Biennale di Firenze, which explored the link between fashion
and cinema. Curated by Terry Jones, the magazine's editor, the
exhibition, which is running in Florence through Nov. 22, allowed
22 designers to place their clothes in an artistic setting of their
choice related to movies.
</P>
<P>
   Designers continually seek to show fashion's links to art, when
what many really want to do is to show how fashion is itself an art
form and can stand alone. It is this approach that was at the heart
of Ennio Capasa's winning collection for Costume National. The
white zippered skirts and jackets were a continuation on themes he
had started with last season. His low-slung pants and skirts are
now looser and have a sexy belt that sits just above the hipbone as
if an attached belt had become separated from the skirt.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Bergere's nod to the Gothic resulted in one of his most
decisive collections. The reference to religion and church was in
the elegant models whose heads were draped with scarfs like
mantillas. There were also loose caftans and light coats inspired
by clerics' robes.
</P>
<P>
   There seems no question that the Hermes-Martin Margiela new
alliance was crazy like a fox. Margiela's collections for the house
make for shows that are short on drama, but they do make plenty of
sense for a house with a reputation for innovative luxury. The
tunic jacket, without buttons, from last season has become a white
shirt and a jacket in light linen and supple suede. The sleeveless
jacket, a Margiela signature, looks at home at Hermes, and Margiela
offers tubular trousers as well as impeccable seamed ones in white
linen. While it did not make for one of the most scintillating
moments in fashion, Margiela and Hermes are at least truly looking
for a new look. &QL;

NASA A-OKs OCT. 29 LAUNCH OF DISCOVERY WITH ASTRONAUT GLENN 
 
By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASA managers on Tuesday formally agreed to proceed with the
launch of the shuttle Discovery, with Mercury astronaut John Glenn
among its crew members, on Oct. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery is scheduled to blast off on its nine-day research
mission at 1 p.m., CST.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, now 77, is returning to space 36 years after he became
the first American to orbit the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   He joins an international crew of seven commanded by Curt Brown,
pilot Steve Lindsey and payload commander Steve Robinson. Their
crew mates include flight engineer Scott Parazynski, Japanese
astronaut Chiaki Mukai, European Space Agency astronaut Pedro Duque
of Spain and Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   Named to the shuttle crew in January, Glenn has combined his
legislative duties in the U.S. Senate with training at the Johnson
Space Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   He will serve primarily as a subject in a range of medical
experiments designed to identify similarities between the stresses
of space flight on the human body and the natural aging processes.
More than 80 experiments are planned all told.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery's countdown will get under way on Oct. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, NASA announced its Advanced X-ray Astrophysics
Facility will not be ready for its scheduled launching on Jan. 21,
1999, aboard the shuttle Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second delay of the flight, which had been planned
for August.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the agency's Marshall Space Flight Center said the
large X-ray telescope will remain with its manufacturer, the TRW
Space and Electronics Group for the replacement of an electronics
component and more testing.
</P>
<P>
   A new launching date will not be announced in mid-January. &QL;

ANALYSIS: KOSOVO PACT MAY HAVE BOSNIA-STYLE PITFALLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KOSOVO-ACCORD and KOSOVO-U.S.) 
(bl) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Through forceful if belated diplomacy, the
Clinton administration has won enormous concessions from Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic. But the agreement announced Tuesday
on Kosovo, the embattled province in southern Serbia, seems fraught
with the dangers that have long bedeviled the West in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   For a Serbian leader to accept NATO jet fighters patrolling over
the sacred ground of Kosovo is an unusual act of pragmatism over
principle.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the United States seems to have secured a
temporary end to the fighting between Serbs and separatist Albanian
forces, with the promised withdrawal of troops and police from
Kosovo. British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Tuesday, ``Mr.
Milosevic has taken some big steps back.''
</P>
<P>
   But once again, as in the Croatian war of 1991 and the 1992-95
Bosnian war, Milosevic has retreated only after advancing his aims
a very long way _ in this case, through the eviction of more than
200,000 ethnic Albanians from their homes _ before apparently
trying to lock in his gains by accepting the deployment of
international monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Once again a concerted international intervention is only coming
after violence has gone so far that attainment of a lasting peace
is certain to be difficult. The Kosovo Liberation Army guerrilla
movement Tuesday rejected the accord, saying, ``All solutions but
independence are not acceptable to the KLA.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, as with the large United Nations force in Bosnia and
Herzegovina, thousands of European observers will be placed with
scant means, if any, to defend themselves while U.S. NATO pilots
patrol overhead and attempt, in the words of NATO spokesman Jamie
Shea, ``to put some spine into the mission of the monitors.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bosnia proved, that particular configuration, in an area
where no peace settlement exists, has drawbacks. It undermines the
deterrent force of air power by placing potential international
hostages and victims beneath the planes. It can easily lead to
divergent U.S. and European views of the conflict. And it tends to
ensure that the buck stops in mid-air.
</P>
<P>
   During a brief visit to NATO headquarters Monday, Richard
Holbrooke, who negotiated the agreement, insisted that the 2,000
monitors to be deployed in Kosovo under the auspices of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe be of the
highest quality.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats said Holbrooke suggested that some could be
soldiers in civilian clothes, and many others could be drawn from
police forces in NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact remains that the security organization is an
unwieldy group that sprawls across countries of vastly different
cultures, and it will find itself in the middle of a conflict for
which no resolution is in sight. Corruption and indiscipline may
prove to be persistent problems.
</P>
<P>
   The onus of verifying Milosevic's compliance with a commitment
to withdrawal his troops and special police forces thus seems
likely to fall on NATO, which is already stretched by its Bosnian
commitments. As in Bosnia, Kosovo could well become a long-term
Western protectorate, expensive and treacherous to maintain.
</P>
<P>
   For despite Milosevic's pledge to restore the Albanian autonomy
he quashed a decade ago when he was president of Serbia, and
despite U.S. ideas to make that autonomy sweeping and genuine, no
long-term vision of how Kosovo can be made lastingly peaceful
exists. That is the painful void behind Holbrooke's
patched-together truce.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, like all NATO governments, considers
independence for Kosovo _ changing a European border _
unacceptable. Even Turkey, always a strong supporter of the Bosnian
Muslims, is muted about the independence claims of Kosovo's Muslim
Albanians because its sympathy for fellow Muslims is outweighed by
concern over setting a precedent for the Kurds in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said in Brussels last
week, ``We have made it clear to Milosevic and Kosovars that we do
not support independence for Kosovo, that we want Serbia out of
Kosovo, not Kosovo out of Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   This tortuous formulation reflects a difficult reality: If
Kosovo is not ``out of Serbia,'' Serbia will inevitably be present
in one form or another in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   And in a province whose population is 90 percent ethnic
Albanian, after the violence of the past six months it appears at
best uncertain that such a presence would be tolerated for long _
unless Serbian rule is one day maintained again, as Tuesday, at
gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   As one NATO official put it: ``A serious problem is that the
legitimacy of any form of Serbian rule in Kosovo is shrinking fast.
After the terrorizing of the population on this scale, it is pretty
clear that intense international verification is needed to sustain
any settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, as in Bosnia, the cycle of violence and revenge
may have gone too far to allow any peace _ other than Kosovo
independence _ to be self-sustaining without international
monitors.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 7,000 U.S. troops already in Bosnia on a mission
that now looks open-ended, that prospect is scarcely appealing to
the Clinton administration or to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was precisely to the avoidance of another Bosnia that
Ms. Albright committed the United States six months ago. But in the
interim, NATO moved with a painful slowness, as many alliance
officials acknowledged Tuesday, and scars similar to those that
make Bosnia so unstable seem to have been inflicted on Kosovo.
Moreover, once again, the United States has chosen to work with
Milosevic rather than defeat him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took us too long,'' said one NATO official. ``But we are 16
democracies, and consensus is hard to forge.''
</P>
<P>
   The most optimistic scenario is that the international presence
backed by the threat of force will restore Albanian self-rule in
Kosovo, allowing the more strident and violent supporters of
independence to be marginalized until a more lasting settlement is
negotiated three years from now.
</P>
<P>
   But the humiliations of the past decade and the violence of the
past six months have raised the ambitions of even moderate ethnic
Albanians well beyond autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 President George Bush told Milosevic that Washington
drew the line at Kosovo. U.S. soldiers were dispatched to
Macedonia, a former Yugoslav republic that borders Kosovo and has a
population that is one-third ethnic Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of the U.S. soldiers represented an attempt at
preventive diplomacy. It worked for a while, but when the trouble
started in Kosovo, those soldiers did not move from Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   And so, six years later, another U.S. administration finds
itself engaged in reactive diplomacy in the Balkans, an effort that
may have come too late to salvage a sustainable peace.

 BISHOPS URGE MORE ADVANCEMENT OF LAYWOMEN IN CHURCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A committee of the nation's Roman Catholic bishops declared
Tuesday that the church authorities ought to do more to promote
qualified women to positions of lay leadership in the church,
thereby increasing the ranks of those who serve in such jobs as
hospital administrators, school superintendents and even
chancellors of dioceses.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement written by the bishops' Committee on Women in
Society and in the Church, the committee said, ``We emphasize the
need to appoint women to positions that entail substantive
responsibility and influence, so that the church may reap the full
benefit of their talents.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement, titled ``From Words to Deeds,'' also called for a
greater appreciation of women's leadership abilities and asked for
a spirit of collaboration between men and women in the church. But
it did not challenge or even discuss the church's position that the
priesthood is restricted to men.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, by noting those offices that may be held by lay people
within the code of canon law, the statement effectively described
church leadership as something that extends beyond those who are
ordained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We assume that all roles in the church are open to women,
unless stated otherwise by canon law,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   That distinction is crucial, especially since Pope John Paul II
has said the restriction of the priesthood to men is definitive and
closed to discussion. As if to add a new emphasis to his words,
another bishops' committee made public a separate document Tuesday,
intended, it said, ``to assist the faithful in their acceptance of
what the church teaches'' about the priesthood.
</P>
<P>
   That document, written by the Committee on Doctrine and titled
``Ten Frequently Asked Questions About the Reservation of Priestly
Ordination to Men,'' says the male priesthood is a fundamental
element of the faith, received directly from Jesus, who called only
men as his apostles. ``The basis for this teaching is the authority
of Christ himself,'' the document states.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the bishops' conference said it was a
coincidence that the two documents were made public on the same
day.
</P>
<P>
   The statement on women, said Auxiliary Bishop John Dunne,
chairman of the committee that wrote it, ``is saying to the church,
to all of us, `Let's be open to what women can be.'''
</P>
<P>
   Before writing its statement, the committee spent two years
meeting with lay people and priests from around the country, said
Dunne, auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Rockville Center on Long
Island, N.Y. The statement reflects those conversations, saying the
committee recognized that any discussion of women's roles in the
church ``can evoke strong emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heard women speak of their satisfaction when ordained
leaders recognize their gifts and skills and use them to serve the
church's mission,'' the statement said. ``We have also heard women
speak of their hurt and pain when ordained leaders reject or do not
fully use these gifts.''
</P>
<P>
   To promote the appreciation of women's talents and to speed
their appointment to church jobs, the statement offers a number of
suggestions. It also contains, in its conclusion, a ``fundamental
recommendation'' that all Catholics examine their words and actions
to see whether these ``promote progress on women's roles in the
church.'' And it warns against ``harsh rhetoric,'' arrogance and an
unwillingness to listen.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, which is advisory rather than binding on
dioceses, was written to follow up a pastoral message on the role
of women in the church issued by the bishops' conference in 1994.
It also comes at a time when many dioceses are confronted by a
growing shortage of priests, so that fewer ordained men are
available for jobs outside the local parish.
</P>
<P>
   Dunne said he hoped the statement would encourage other bishops
to do more than place a small number of women in leadership
positions. ``Where people have the talents or have the experience,
they ought to have the positions, too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how a diocese might make use of women's leadership
abilities, he said he would ``very humbly'' point to Rockville
Center, where women serve as superintendent of parochial schools
and as editor of the diocesan newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Wallace, a professor of sociology at George Washington
University who has written about women who have been appointed to
administer parishes, praised the committee's statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``My overall impression is that this is the result of these
bishops taking seriously the gifts of women to enhance the work of
the church,'' Wallace said. ``I think the women who are heading
parishes around the country are going to think they have been
applauded.''

AT LEASDT 10 DIE IN EXPLOSION AT MEXICO FIREWORKS FACTORY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TULTEPEC, Mexico _ An explosion in a house that doubled as a
fireworks factory carved a crater two blocks long in this nation's
self-proclaimed pyrotechnics capital Tuesday, killing 10 people and
trapping dozens under layers of concrete and rubble.
</P>
<P>
   What set this blast apart from previous gas-line explosions in
Mexico was the reaction of residents in this congested town near
Mexico City, who are fearful of losing jobs in its dominant
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of defensive residents tried to stop police and rescue
officials from entering their homes to inspect the damage. The
homes sometimes serve as illegal storehouses for gunpowder and
sulfur used in fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents, with the choking stench of sulphur and gunpowder
prevading the air, insisted that the highly flammable stocks did
not help spread the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fireworks is our way of life and many of us don't know how to
do anything else,'' said Cristobal Salas de Castillo, a 47-
year-old resident who works in a nearby factory.
</P>
<P>
   The blast, which injured at least 27 people and damaged or
destroyed more than 150 homes, also is bound to raise questions
about regulation in the industry, which is overseen by Mexico's
defense department.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the explosion was still unclear as of Tuesday
night, authorites said. Local police said a natural gas leak may
have been the cause but neighbors and other investigators said that
illegally stored fireworks were probably also to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Tultepec, a city of 50,000 people about 20 miles north of Mexico
City, has specialized in fireworks for generations. A large yellow
sign that hangs over the city's main avenue reads ``Welcome to
Tultepec, capital of pyrotechnics.''
</P>
<P>
   As residents huddled on street corners near the center of the
blast three large bulldozers clawed through the rubble and rescue
workers searched for more survivors. As far as a half-mile from the
site dirt roads were littered with shards of glass from broken
windows and shreds of fireworks casings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the population here is dedicated to the fireworks
industry,'' said Felipe Medina Santos, director general of Mexico's
civil defense. ``We're not sure if this work shop was legal or
illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican army troops were deployed to the area to help restore
order and to investigate. The council's National Defense department
administers the fireworks industry, selling it gunpowder and
setting out safety standards, such as prohibiting factories from
heavily populated areas.
</P>
<P>
   But as competition here has intensified over the last several
years, officials acknowledge that scores of illegal and hazardous
workshops have sprouted in many of Tultepec's residential
neighborhoods. In June 1997, another fireworks-related blast in one
home here killed three people. A 1988 blast spread from a Mexico
City marketplace selling illegal fireworks, killing 65 people.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, on a lush stretch of land about 5 miles north of the
Tultepec blast, dozens of authorized fireworks factories sit in
carefully partitioned rows. On one of those plots, Juan Flores
Fiesco, 57, delicately lifted crates of freshly made firecrackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a permit and our methods are constantly reviewed by
the government,'' Flores said as he walked around the factory that
his family has owned for three generations. His own home lies just
one block from the explosion site.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the devastated Tultepec neighborhood, Manuel Martinez, a
28-year-old mechanical engineer, quietly watched the rescue crews.
He said one of those killed Tuesday was one of the town's fireworks
leaders _ and something more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like I've lost my closest friend,'' Martinez said.

PHOENIX SLUMLORD JAILED OVER ALLEGED INTIMIDATION 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHOENIX - The day went from bad to worse to completely lousy for
notorious Valley landlord Sherwin Seyrafi.
</P>
<P>
   _ After being convicted in court of six misdemeanor counts, he
was arrested on a felony charge of obstruction of justice and
booked into jail.
</P>
<P>
   _ During a somber jailhouse interview in which he apologized to
``the people of Arizona and to anyone else,'' he offered to give
his remaining properties to charity.
</P>
<P>
   _ An hour later, in a Madison Street Jail courtroom, Seyrafi was
told he's ``unbondable'' and would stay in jail for weeks, if not
months.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest and most dramatic chapter in Seyrafi's
long-running battle with Phoenix and Maricopa County officials, who
have branded him a ``slumlord'' and sought repeatedly to penalize
him for operating substandard properties and refusing to heed
tenants' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   His real-estate companies have accumulated about 400 maintenance
complaints at their Phoenix rentals since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Seyrafi began Tuesday in an east Phoenix justice court. He faced
six misdemeanor counts alleging environmental health violations in
apartments he owned in the 4900 block of East Holly Street in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   He was found guilty on all counts, but the state requested that
the sentencing be postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Seyrafi was outside the court standing in a
circle of journalists when a Maricopa County Attorney's Office
investigator leaned in, whispered to Seyrafi that he was under
arrest and snapped handcuffs on his wrists.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're kidding me!'' the astonished landlord gasped.
</P>
<P>
   Seyrafi's arrest stemmed from his alleged efforts to intimidate
a tenant at the Holly Street apartments who had made housing code
complaints against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Seyrafi tried to intimidate Lori Utter into not helping
investigators,'' County Attorney Rick Romley said Tuesday. ``You
cannot intimidate witnesses from coming forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The alleged intimidation apparently happened several times from
May through October.
</P>
<P>
   In a jailhouse news conference Tuesday afternoon, Seyrafi said
he had not intentionally intimidated Utter. The formerly defiant
landlord appeared penitent: ``I'm sitting in front of you very
humble,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I hurt anyone of my present or past tenants, I apologize,''
he said. ``I apologize to everybody, including Ms. Utter.''
</P>
<P>
   Seyrafi said that though he was unsure exactly how much property
he still owned, he would be glad to discuss with the city turning
the property over to a charity.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hoped that ``my properties can benefit the people of
Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   But earlier in the day, Seyrafi's attorney had said his client
was indigent, and that of the 28 properties Seyrafi once owned, he
now was down to four _ all in various stages of foreclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Seyrafi probably won't own anything by the end of the
year,'' Richard Coffinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Coffinger also said he found the obstruction of justice charge
``very scary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The woman in question was still his tenant,'' he said, ``and
it is very difficult to have a continuing relationship with someone
and not do something that the tenant might not like.''
</P>
<P>
   A court document filed by Romley's office noted that Utter had
repeatedly reported housing code violations at the property.
</P>
<P>
   ``In May 1998, Mr. Seyrafi accused Ms. Utter of being the
troublemaker and problem in the apartment complex,'' the document
says.
</P>
<P>
   Utter verified that Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that he wanted me out 'cause I was causing too many
problems,'' she said. ``I was a real pain for him, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Seyrafi raised Utter's rent in August and again in September,
according to the court document.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 30, Seyrafi was sentenced to spend 30 days in an
apartment in his Holly Street complex; he appealed the sentence
Friday and thus has not moved in.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the Sept. 30 sentencing, Seyrafi drove to the
apartments and spoke to Utter. She reported that he told her he was
raising her rent and that he wanted her out of the apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents say that on Oct. 7, Seyrafi accused Utter of
`'talking with a representative of `The Arizona Republic.' '' Then
he said, ``Never mind, I'm not going to argue with you, I'm just
going to get you out of here. I want you out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   The obstruction of justice charge is a Class 5 felony, and could
result in a fine or prison time, Romley said.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Seyrafi was convicted in Phoenix Municipal Court of
numerous violations of the neighborhood preservation ordinance and
was sentenced to 60 days in jail. He served 13 days, then was
released pending appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In June, a county grand jury indicted Seyrafi on seven felony
counts for allegedly defrauding tenants out of security deposits.
If convicted at trial this fall, he could face 12{ years in prison
on each count.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the investigation into Seyrafi's dealings, and
those of other landlords, Romley and Phoenix City Councilman Phil
Gordon formed a Slumlord Task Force that soon will propose
legislation to strengthen Arizona's rental laws. &QL;

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The American special envoy Richard
Holbrooke announced an agreement here on Tuesday that averted the
immediate threat of NATO air strikes against Serbia and could lead
to a form of autonomy in Kosovo Province.
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the accord with President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia calls for 2,000 international observers and NATO
reconnaissance flights to monitor troop and police withdrawals in
Kosovo, where Serbian forces have mounted a crackdown against the
mainly ethnic Albanian population. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The composition of an observer force had been a stumbling block
in the nine days of talks because Milosevic would not allow foreign
troops to be stationed on his territory. How the unarmed civilian
force will be deployed and how it will actually verify the status
of Milosevic's military forces remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said that as part of the accord Milosevic had also
committed himself to elections in Kosovo and amnesty for those
accused of taking part in the fighting on behalf of the ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the accord, both sides in the standoff _
Milosevic on one side and Washington and NATO on the other _ could
claim victory. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a rare television appearance here, Milosevic said he had
preserved his country's dignity and territorial integrity, an
allusion to his insistence that foreign troops not be deployed.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, NATO officials stressed that it was only the
approval Monday night of a so-called activation order authorizing
NATO air strikes against Serbia that had forced Milosevic to
finalize the negotiations. But at a news conference on Tuesday,
Holbrooke said that the agreement had been reached Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke outlined what is essentially a three-part agreement
intended to meet conditions laid out in a Security Council
resolution on Sept. 23: verification, from the ground and the air,
of the withdrawal of military forces, and the setting up of a
political process for Kosovo's future. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ground verification agreement is to be signed by the Serbian
authorities and Bronislaw Geremek, the chairman of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which will organize the
verification team. The accord on verification from the air is to be
signed by the secretary general of NATO, Javier Solana, and the
commander of NATO Forces, Gen. Wesley Clark, and Yugoslav
officials, Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke held out particular hope for the pledges by the
Serbian authorities Tuesday night on a political process for
Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs about nine to one.
``We hope that it will mark a turning point in the tortured and
tragic relationships between the peoples _ Albanian, Serb, others _
in Kosovo,'' he said. But he indicated details still needed to be
worked out.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to be specific about how many soldiers or police
officers Milosevic was required to withdraw from Kosovo, where the
Yugoslav army and the Serbian police have been waging a brutal
campaign against the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army and its
civilian supporters. He said the withdrawals by the Serbs had to be
in compliance with the U.N. resolution, which mentions only general
pre-crisis levels but is not precise about numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas have been fighting for the independence of the
province, which had its autonomy within Yugoslavia revoked by
Milosevic nine years ago. The West does not back independence for
the province but has been seeking some kind of middle ground.
</P>
<P>
   Barduhl Mahmuti, a KLA spokesman in Switzerland, reiterated the
separatists' stance for independence but added: ``We agree to a
three-year transition period that would lead to self-determination.
If Mr. Milosevic accepts that we are satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke acknowledged that he had failed to persuade Milosevic
to comply with a U.N. resolution calling for him to allow the
international war crimes tribunal in The Hague to have jurisdiction
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's only concession on future operations of the tribunal
in Kosovo was to allow freedom of access and a doubling of its
operations there. The tribunal has a representative office in
Belgrade staffed by one or two people, Western diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   The question of jurisdiction of the tribunal is particularly
sensitive to Milosevic because of two widely publicized massacres
of ethnic Albanians, apparently by Serbian forces, on Sept. 26,
three days after the U.N. resolution demanded Milosevic adopt a
cease-fire and withdraw his forces.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how quickly the 2,000 observers, whom Holbrooke
specifically defined as ``verifiers,'' could be assembled. They
will be drawn from among diplomats, former military personnel and
non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The observers are to have a number of roles: verifying
Milosevic's troop levels, assisting relief groups to help in the
return of about 250,000 ethnic Albanian refugees to their homes and
monitoring elections.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,000-member team is to operate under the auspices of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a group of
nations based in Vienna that includes the United States and Russia
as members.
</P>
<P>
   Known for its monitoring of elections, arms control agreements
and human rights, the organization has never tried anything on the
scale called for in the Kosovo agreement. Its biggest long-term
mission so far has been of 300 monitors in Bosnia. The observers
are to be present in Kosovo for one year with the possibility of
renewal if both sides agree, an official of the group said.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said that Geremek, who is the foreign minister of
Poland, was somewhat taken aback by the size and potential expense
of the role devised for the OSCE in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Geremek met Holbrooke Monday night in Brussels to review the
agreement and is expected to come to Belgrade on Friday for a
signing ceremony with the Serbian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Solana and Clark, the two top NATO officials, will come to
Belgrade to sign the reconnaissance agreement with the Yugoslav
authorities and are ``enthusiastically preparing'' for the trip,
Holbrooke said. But Solana's office in Brussels said it was not
clear where the signing would take place.
</P>
<P>
   For the longer-term future of Kosovo, the president of Serbia,
Milan Milutinovic, announced on television tonight an 11-point
political agenda and a seemingly ambitious timetable.
</P>
<P>
   The document said there would be a restoration of
self-government to be achieved through elections for a Kosovo
parliament within nine months.
</P>
<P>
   The agenda said that local police forces would be created based
on ``proportion of population.'' This would mean that the police in
towns and villages would be almost entirely ethnic Albanian, a
radical change from the various kinds of present-day police forces,
which are almost totally Serbian.
</P>
<P>
   Before heading home to New York, Holbrooke was asked if
Milosevic could be trusted to fulfill the agreement worked out over
nine days of sessions that often ended after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The question of trust and Milosevic is a favorite theme of
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. She has repeatedly said he
cannot be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke was less definitive. ``Our issue is to deal with the
realities and do the best we can,'' Holbrooke said. On the question
of trust he said, ``There's no value in going down that route
today.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The agreement was particularly welcome news for the
approximately 250,000 ethnic Albanian refugees who have been forced
in the last five months to abandon their villages after methodical
attacks by Serb forces. Tens of thousands of these refugees are
still camped in the open in makeshift shelters, waiting for the
Serbian police to disappear from the perimeters of their villages
before they go home.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees are clustered in four main areas where the fighting
was heaviest: the Drenica region in central Kosovo around the towns
of Glogovac, Klina and Srbica; around the towns of Pec and Prizren
in western Kosovo; north of the capital of Pristina around the
towns of Podujevo and Mitrovica, and in the southern region around
Suva Reka where the Serbian offensive wound up 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   The agreements were also good news to the international relief
agencies, which will carry the burden of helping restore the broken
lives of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret O'Keefe, the director of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees office in Belgrade, said that more than
20 foreign staff members had left Serbia by Monday night, leaving
only three behind. The biggest concern had been that workers from
NATO countries might be targets of Serbian extremists, she said.
But the staff was beginning to return on Tuesday and two truck
convoys will head for Kosovo on Wednesday, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the American diplomats who left Belgrade by car for
Hungary on Monday returned to Belgrade on Tuesday afternoon. Their
departure in a convoy of cars and the partial closure of the U.S.
Embassy _ documents were shredded and computer hard drives
destroyed _ was intended to increase the pressure on Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But the 40 American and European Union diplomatic monitors who
have been driving around Kosovo for the last several months and
sending reports to their capitals on the fighting were unlikely to
return to Kosovo until next week, at least.

HOLBROOKE'S U.N. NOMINATION STILL ON HOLD AMID ETHICS PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The diplomatic career of Richard Holbrooke, who
brokered the agreement on Kosovo, remains in the hands of Justice
Department lawyers who are trying to determine if he violated
federal ethics rules.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials say the investigation, which
has sidetracked Holbrooke's nomination as the next chief U.S.
representative at the United Nations, is expected to last several
more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry is trying to determine if Holbrooke had improper
contacts with former State Department colleagues while working as
an investment banker in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, a former ambassador to Germany and the architect of
the 1995 settlement that ended the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, left
the State Department two years ago for a Wall Street career.
</P>
<P>
   He has not been formally nominated for the United Nations
position. Thus, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee says, it
will not be able to address the issue this year.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke's lawyer, Richard Beattie, said in an interview that
Holbrooke's apparently successful negotiations this week with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic offered new evidence of how
valuable he would be at the United Nations. ``This just stresses
the importance of getting this investigation completed and
Holbrooke nominated,'' the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, which was prompted by an anonymous letter
last summer, is being overseen by the public integrity section of
Justice Department and by the State Department inspector general.
``This matter is still pending, and we can't comment on how far
along it is,'' said Bert Brandenburg, the Justice Department's
chief spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say investigators at the Justice
Department are trying to determine if Holbrooke had improper
contacts with State Department officials while pursuing business
deals for his investment banking firm, Credit Suisse First Boston.
Federal ethics laws bar former government officials from lobbying
their former colleagues for a year after they leave the government.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the investigators had requested records from U.S.
embassies across Europe of contacts between embassy officials and
Holbrooke, and of any assistance he may have sought in securing
interviews with foreign leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Holbrooke say it was impossible for him to avoid
contacts with his former State Department colleagues in 1996 and
1997 because he had remained an unpaid adviser to the
administration on the Balkans and traveled widely in Europe. They
say he was careful to separate his work for Credit Suisse from his
work on behalf of the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke would replace Bill Richardson, who stepped down from
the U.N. job to become energy secretary.

 &HT;    Albanian girl denied US visit after brother seeks asylum
 &HT;    By Cathy Mong
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It was the photograph with the barbed wire
faintly showing in the distance that cinched Cheryl Schafer's
decision to host the girl posing with her brother, mother and
father.
</P>
<P>
   The cold symbol of imprisonment was the opposite of the freedom
Schafer felt on her 80-acre farm, surrounded by fields of corn,
soybeans and the gentle mooing of dairy heifers.
</P>
<P>
   All the efforts in the world, however _ calls to embassies,
telephone and Internet conversations _ could not have completed
this match. Unbeknownst to Schafer, the girl, Aelsa Sulaj, had a
brother, Genti Sulaj, who has sought political asylum just 50 miles
away in Miamisburg.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter from The Dayton Daily News called Aelsa in Tirana,
Albania, but the girl was reticent to say anything on the
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The saga began in March, when Schafer told Bill Bayman, Ohio
manager of Council Educational Travel U.S.A. student exchange
program, that Aelsa was her family's choice, and the two families
began chatting on the Internet, on the phone and through letters.
</P>
<P>
   But after several months, Schafer heard that Aelsa didn't
receive her student visa, ostensibly because her English didn't
meet standards.
</P>
<P>
   Schafer thought that odd since she had no trouble speaking with
Aelsa, and her written English was beautiful, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She talked with the U.S. Embassy in Tirana and was told Aelsa's
brother hadn't returned to Albania. Bombings of U.S. embassies Aug.
7 in Tanzania and Kenya forced the closing of the embassy in
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 3, Schafer said, everything made sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked to read a story about an Albanian with Aelsa's
last name seeking political asylum in the United States, in
Miamisburg, Ohio,'' Schafer said. ``Then I read Aelsa's application
and there was his name, her brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Sulaj, who was returning to Albania after finishing his school
year in Idaho, got off his plane May 22 in Cincinnati and didn't
get back on for the rest of the trip. He took a bus to Dayton and
after three weeks in shelters, moved in with Frances and Charles
Holloway and applied for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Sulaj claims his parents are on the wrong side of the political
fence in his native country, and he would be in danger if he
returned. And the youth also fears he has closed the door on his
sister's chances of leaving the troubled country.
</P>
<P>
   Bayman said that's probably a fair assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have a relative who didn't return, she wouldn't get
out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he pledged to bring as many students from Albania as
possible because of the region's turmoil. Currently, he is hosting
Evisa Quku, 17, also from Tirana.
</P>
<P>
   Schafer said her family is hosting Ksenia ``Ksusha'' Kalinina,
16, from Eastern Siberia, but she holds on to the hope to see Aelsa
one day.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't blame Genti Sulaj for seeking asylum. ``I really
feel for the Albanian kids. If Aelsa were here now, to put her on
the plane home now would break my heart, knowing what they're doing
to the people over there.''
</P>
<P>
   For information on how to host an Albanian student, call Bayman
at (877) CETUSA3 after 3:30 p.m. CDT.

KABC HOST BELL SAYS THREATS FORCING HIM TO QUIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Conspiracy theorist, UFO aficionado and syndicated radio host
Art Bell announced Tuesday he was quitting the airwaves, hinting
that his family was under a mysterious threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you are listening to is my final broadcast,'' Bell told
the audience of his overnight ``Coast to Coast'' call-in show
before signing off about 3 a.m. on local talk outlet KABC-AM (790).
</P>
<P>
   Station officials insist Bell's resignation was not a stunt,
adding that he was not in the midst of contract talks. A KABC
spokeswoman said management was scrambling to find out what was
going on, while a decision had not been made on how to fill Bell's
time slot.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday's broadcast, Bell said ``a threatening, terrible
event occurred to my family, which I could not tell you about.
Because of that event, and a succession of other events, what
you're listening to right now is my final broadcast.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's Lt. Bill Becht said officers were sent to Bell's home
upon learning of the farewell broadcast. They found him there, with
no evidence of foul play, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any threats were not criminal in nature,'' Becht said.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, 51, hosted his radio show from his home in rural Pahrump,
Nev. The program focused on such paranormal activity as alien
abductions, cattle mutilations and secret government programs.
</P>
<P>
   The show was thought to attract more than 6.5 million listeners
on more than 400 stations nationwide. &QL;

KIIS-FM GIVES $1 MILLION-PLUS
</P>
<P>
   Glendale community college student Karolina Khodzhyan feels like
a million bucks, thanks to top-40 KIIS-FM (102.7).
</P>
<P>
   Khodzhyan was awarded a record-breaking $1,000,102.70 by KIIS
morning personality Rick Dees after claiming the winning birth date
in a call-in contest co-sponsored by Rio All Suites Hotel &AMP; Casino
in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy _ and shocked, shocked, shocked,'' said
Armenia-born Khodzhyan, 22, a business major who works as a
receptionist at a medical management firm.
</P>
<P>
   Khodzhyan said she would spend her winnings on a house for her
parents, a car for her younger brother and her own education.
</P>
<P>
   The longtime KIIS listener was at her desk at 9:10 a.m. Sept. 30
when Dees announced her birth date _ Feb. 26, 1976. The 10th caller
with the matching birthday would become an instant millionaire,
Dees said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept dialing and dialing and finally got through,''
Khodzhyan said Monday. ``I couldn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Khodzhyan was accompanied by co-workers and family members when
she went to KIIS' Burbank studios to claim her prize, which could
amount to roughly $620,000 after taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Michaels, chief executive officer of KIIS' parent company,
Kentucky-based Jacor Communications, was program director at
Cincinnati's WKRQ when it set a world record in 1980 for the
largest amount given out in a radio contest _ $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   To break that record, KIIS added $102.70, making Khodzhyan's
gross $1,000,102.70, station spokesman Von Freeman said.
</P>
<P>
   KIIS launched a second search for a $1 million birthday winner
Oct. 7.
</P>
<P>
   GOODBYE GROOVE
</P>
<P>
   Groove 103.1 is gone, and the news isn't good for fans of techno
and dance music.
</P>
<P>
   The Groove stations, Santa Monica's KACD-FM and Newport Beach
simulcast outlet KBCD-FM, were recently purchased for $67 million
by Jacor, which owns 230 properties across the country, including
KIIS.
</P>
<P>
   At noon Monday, the dance music stopped, disc jockeys bade
listeners farewell and a simulcast of KIIS began.
</P>
<P>
   Insiders say the new KACD/KBCD format, to be unveiled next week,
will likely be adult alternative, similar to that of now-defunct
KSCA-FM, which was beloved by its relatively few listeners for
giving airplay to Sarah McLachlan, the Dave Matthews Band, Joni
Mitchell and other acts popular with the boomer crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But in the year since KSCA went off the air, KYSR-FM (98.7) _
Star 98 _ KBIG-FM (104.3) and several other outlets have added
adult alternative artists.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there's now nowhere on the dial to hear the
admittedly low-rated Groove's unique mix of techno, r&AMP;b and
four-on-the-floor dance music.
</P>
<P>
   Over at KACD, nobody's talking just yet.
</P>
<P>
   DYLAN DOCUMENATRY
</P>
<P>
   To coincide with the official release this week of an
oft-bootlegged Bob Dylan concert recording from 1966, the Museum of
Television &AMP; Radio in Beverly Hills is hosting screenings of the
rare Dylan documentary ``Eat the Document.'' Screening times are 6
p.m. Thursday and 1 p.m. Friday, Saturday and Sunday, through Nov.
13. ... Rush Limbaugh is on top among talk hosts, says Talkers
radio trade mag. According to the publication's latest survey,
Limbaugh has at least 15 million weekly listeners, followed by Dr.
Laura Schlessinger with at least 14.5 million and Howard Stern with
at least 9 million. &QL;

STARR MUM ON OTHER AREAS OF HIS INVESTIGATION OF CLINTON
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth W. Starr's investigations into the
Whitewater land venture, the possible abuse of FBI files, and the
dismissal of the White House travel office staff appear to be
ending with neither a bang nor a whimper, but rather in silence.
Administration officials say this silence is a cheap attempt by
Starr to further damage President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials and their Democratic allies are becoming
increasingly critical of the independent counsel's decision not to
conclude his grand jury investigations and provide them some form
of exoneration. While Starr has said his inquiries may yet lead to
further allegations of impeachable acts, many Democrats contend the
independent counsel is trying to taint Clinton with innuendo
because he cannot criminally implicate him with fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unconscionable that he just does not terminate those
investigations and make those announcements so this matter can be
brought to closure,'' said Representative William Delahunt,
(D-Mass.) a former prosecutor, and a member of the House Judiciary
Committee. ``There have to be reasonable boundaries in terms of
time frames.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's allies said Starr has no evidence of any further
possible impeachable offenses committed by Clinton or Hillary
Rodham Clinton. It is a belief supported by Starr's decision not to
ask a single question during Clinton's Aug. 17 grand jury testimony
related to Whitewater, the FBI files, or the travel office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us believe he hasn't been able to find anything to
implicate the president or the first lady,'' said Harold Ickes, an
informal Clinton adviser and former deputy White House chief of
staff. ``There's a frustration that he hasn't issued a report to
the court. But that's his modus operandi. He lets it hang out there
and hang out there. Right now, it's up in the air, and no one can
say he has made a finding.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr concedes no such point, and said that all his
investigations, while nearing a conclusion, are not over, and that
any determination of more charges cannot yet be made. In his
referral to the House, Starr listed 11 possible grounds for
Congress to impeach Clinton, although all of those were tied to the
president's affair with Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot foreclose the possibility of providing the House of
Representatives with additional substantial and credible
information arising from those investigations that President
William Jefferson Clinton committed acts that may constitute
grounds for an impeachment,'' Starr wrote last week to members of
the House Judiciary Comittee, replying to their request for more
information.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's office has not publicly commented on the status of his
investigations, although one published report indicates that he has
concluded that the FBI files represented little more than a
bureaucratic mishap within the White House.
</P>
<P>
   By law, Starr has several options. He may still seek indictments
against people involved in any of the investigations, he may make
another referral to the House if he concludes that there are
further grounds for impeachment, and he must, by law, issue a
report to the three-judge panel in Washington to conclude his
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   That report would contain the inherent message that he has found
no further impeachable offenses, but he is under no time
restrictions to reach that conclusion, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts said Starr is simply following the letter of
the law and bundling all his investigations together before issuing
a report to the court. He is also known to be actively
investigating accusations made by former White House volunteer
Kathleen Willey that Clinton groped her in a study outside the Oval
Office _ allegations that could still result in a charge of perjury
or obstruction of justice. The grand jury that investigated the
Lewinsky portion of the probe is still convened and met twice last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might be waiting for other testimony to come before he
makes a report to the court,'' said Joseph diGenova, a former
independent counsel. ``There are all sorts of acceptable reasons
why he wouldn't have filed anything yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said it is a fact of life in criminal investigations that
the subjects of any probe rarely receive sweeping and definite
exoneration.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the unfortunate things about being the target of a
criminal investigation is that there is typically no formal process
for closure,'' said Robert Luskin, a criminal defense attorney in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In the independent counsel statute, he added, ``there is a
report back to the court, but in an ordinary case, you don't ever
get anything back from a grand jury or a prosecutor, like a letter.
What happens is you just never hear from them.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats and White House officials, however, say Starr has
decided not to conclude the portions of his investigation relating
to Whitewater, the FBI files, and the travel office because he
wants the specter of future charges to haunt Clinton as the House
determines whether to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the Republican leadership hinted last week that
they may seek to expand the Lewinsky inquiry into areas of
Whitewater and the travel office dismissals, angering their
Democratic colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a prosecutor trying to make a move on a defendant,
you leverage every bit of power you have,'' Representative James A.
Traficant Jr., a Democrat from Ohio, said in a telephone interview.
``It's the unfair atmosphere that I don't like. They say he did one
thing, but the scuttlebutt is that they have more.''
</P>
<P>
   Traficant has proposed that the House compel Starr to submit any
evidence of wrongdoing by Clinton in any of the other probes, so
lawmakers may weigh the range of allegations in an impeachment
proceeding and not harbor suspicions of future charges. But the
proposal has little support among members of the Republican
majority.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitewater inquiry initially began under special prosecutor
Robert B. Fiske in January 1994, and was intended to focus on
Clinton's real estate investments in Arkansas that were tied to a
failed savings and loan association.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Starr, who replaced Fiske, received permission from the
appellate court judges to investigate why seven members of the
White House travel office were dismissed and whether Mrs. Clinton
concealed her involvement. Later in 1996, Starr added to his
portfolio an investigation into whether the White House abused the
secret FBI files on more than 400 Republicans in prior
administrations.
</P>
<P>
   This past January Starr took on the last piece of his probe:
allegations that Clinton lied under oath in the Paula Jones
sexual-harassment lawsuit when he denied having a sexual
relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more benign explanation is he might just not be finished
with those investigations,'' said Paul Rothstein, a professor at
the Georgetown University Law Center. ``It does seem to be a
stretch that at this time, he isn't in a position to draw some type
of conclusion. There comes a time when you have to either fish or
cut bait.''

   ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (Moved in `e' category)
</P>
<P>
   FEATURE STORY
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN-THEATER (Undated) _ Like book publishing before it _
until the last decade, a quaint holdout against the forces of media
consolidation _ the theater is now becoming ``content'' suitable
for synergistic annexation and exploitation by our new
entertainment conglomerates. By Frank Rich.
</P>
<P>
   FILM AND VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   BELOVED-FILM (Undated) _ What is most impressive about the film
version of ``Beloved'' is not that it simplifies Toni Morrison's
difficult esthetic to attract a wider audience and become a
blockbuster in the process, but that it takes an opposite tack: It
stubbornly reinforces a literary way of looking at things.By Will
Joyner.
</P>
<P>
   IAN-MCKELLEN-FILMS (Leeds, England) _ There is something rather
touching about Ian McKellen's new enthusiasm for cinema. Now, at
59, he has acquired an appetite to work in movies, to do what for
the best part of four decades he found unappealing. Is it fame that
he is after? By Alan Riding. With Photo.
</P>
<P>
   FASCISM-MOVIES (Undated) _ Humor may be, in its essence,
anti-fascistic: It takes what is most self-important, most
unyielding and most unforgiving, and dissolves it into absurdity.
Fascism meets its match in farce. That is the approach, delicately
taken, of the new Italian film ``Life is Beautiful,'' the winner of
the grand jury prize at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival. By Edward
Rothstein.
</P>
<P>
   THEATER
</P>
<P>
   THEATER-WIT-CANBY (New York) _ In ``Wit'' the main character
dies at the end but, for the next two hours that pass in a wink,
the audience is treated to the kind of theatrical experience of
which legends are made. We come to know and appreciate the mind and
substance of this singular character and of the playwright who
conceived her, as well as the ravishing potential of the singular
actress who plays Vivian: Kathleen Chalfant.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   AZNAVOUR-MUSIC (Paris) _ Charles Aznavour may well be the only
person who remembers his first visit to New York in 1948. This
week, as Aznavour embarks on a new American tour, public
recognition is the least of his problems. Having sold close to 100
million albums, he now enjoys the magical status of international
musical legend. By Alan Riding.
</P>
<P>
   JUDY-GARLAND-MUSIC (Undated) _ Until the release of ``Judy'' (32
Records), a four-CD career retrospective that comes with an
excellent video showing highlights from her 1963-64 television
variety show, Judy Garland's recorded legacy was scattered among
several different labels. This set, produced by Joel Dorn and his
son, Adam, with the Garland archivist Scott Schechter, encompasses
the breadth of Garland's recording career. By Stephen Holden.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-NOVELTIES (Undated) _ Planned obsolescence may work well
in the auto industry but less well in classical music, which has
invested the bulk of its holdings in the used-symphony and
used-opera business, and has lots of trouble convincing listeners
that the new models are any good. By Bernard Holland.
</P>
<P>
   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   PRINCE-EDWARD-TV (London) _ Prince Edward, 34, the youngest son
of Queen Elizabeth, is beginning to see some financial success in
his own film production company, Ardent Productions. And although
competitors in Britain's television industry complain that he is
shamelessly trading on his connections to advance his career, he
has managed to insure new-found respect for Ardent by crossing the
all-important continental divide and selling a number of his
programs to the United States. By Sarah Lyall.
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES
</P>
<P>
   MINIATURE-OBJECTS-ANTIQUES (Washington) _ Last month, 70 of
Daniel Brush's exquisitely detailed steel and gold miniature
objects went on view here in ``Daniel Brush: Gold Without
Boundaries,'' a retrospective exhibition at the Renwick Gallery of
the National Museum of American Art. The show, through Jan. 10,
coincides with the publication of an elaborately illustrated book
about the artist's metal works. By Rita Reif.

 &HT;    Duval now contends for Player of the Year
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ David Duval's story keeps getting more difficult to
comprehend. The guy who could not find a way to win now can't seem
to locate a way to lose.
</P>
<P>
   For his first 92 starts in PGA Tour events _ until last year's
Michelob Championship at Kingsmill _ the former Georgia Tech player
had on seven occasions been a runner-up. Since then, through last
week's successful defense at Williamsburg, Va., Duval has won seven
times in his last 23 PGA Tour events.
</P>
<P>
   Equally remarkable, Duval is in reach of a semi-unfathomable $3
million season. With $2,464,408 (already a PGA Tour record by
nearly $400,000), the 26-year old Duval has a firm hold on the
money title and easily could pass $3 million with a repeat victory
in three weeks at the Tour Championship at Atlanta's East Lake Golf
Club.
</P>
<P>
   And with Duval fairly familiar with the course, having played it
occasionally during his days at Tech, who do you think will be
favored?
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, there remains yet another possibility. With five
wins _ he defends at the Walt Disney Classic next week _ Duval
could become the prime candidate for PGA Tour Player of the Year.
Two months ago Mark O'Meara seemed an automatic selection with the
Masters and British Open on his record, but things have changed.
Two weeks ago at the Buick Challenge, Duval theorized what could
become reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you can say I have a chance to win it, but I think
I'll certainly have to win another event, if not two more, and the
money title to even be considered over Mark,'' Duval said then.
``To win two majors is obviously a huge deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``For someone to beat that, you'd have to win four or five times
and no one else has won more than twice (Duval leads everyone else,
4-2). I guess then you could make an argument either way. If I have
to vote, I'll probably abstain.''
</P>
<P>
   Those major championships _ or the lack of one _ are what leave
a trace of dissatisfaction for Duval and explain why he so respects
the owner of two. With a major secured, Duval would more readily
accept the ``best player in the world'' references.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have a bit of a void on my resume,'' Duval said. ``I
do think that the past 12 months I've played as well as anybody
else. But whether that makes me the best player, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistics beyond the money list only enhance Duval's case. He
is first in scoring (69.02), putting (1.720 per hole) and birdies
(4.39 per round). He is second in all-around ranking (combined
categories), tied for second in total driving, fourth in greens in
regulation (70.2 percent) and sixth in driving distance (286.7).
</P>
<P>
   For a guy with nearly $6.3 million earned in less than four full
seasons, believe that the money title is meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majors are the majors _ you've got four of them each year
and I'm not belittling them at all and please don't take it that
way,'' Duval said. ``But only one person can win the money title,
so there's got to be something special to it.''

 &HT;    Nicklaus out for year
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Still pained by his degenerative right hip, Jack Nicklaus, 58,
has canceled the rest of his season, including customary
appearances in the Shark Shootout and Wendy's Three-Tour Challenge.
Nicklaus said he will not play competitively before January if
invited to the Senior Skins Game and might not even take his clubs
to Australia when captaining the U.S. in the President's Cup.
``It's not hitting the golf ball or walking,'' Nicklaus said.
``It's the twisting and turning of the golf swing combined with
walking. I just went bow-hunting in Arizona and we walked 5-10
miles a day and I felt great with just a little Advil. I felt like
I could go play shortstop.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus used one of his infrequent rounds to play Atlanta's
East Lake Golf Club last week as a guest of developer Tom Cousins.
Assessing East Lake for the Tour Championship in three weeks,
Nicklaus, who chipped for eagle on the par-5 15th, termed the
Bermuda rough, clipped to about 4 1/2 inches, as tough but fair.
``The golf course is in absolutely wonderful condition,'' said
Nicklaus, who played it earlier in May. ``The players will really
like the club and the golf course. I think the scores will be
reasonable. I don't think they're going to tear it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Crunch time for top 30
</P>
<P>
   Stewart Cink, an East Lake member, inched up to the 31st spot on
the money list by winning $13,894 at Kingsmill Sunday, but still
trails No. 30 Bob Tway by nearly $53,000. Atlanta's Billy Andrade,
another East Lake member, made $10,038 and stands 41st at $690,209.
Realistically, Andrade needs a win at either Las Vegas or Walt
Disney to make the Tour Championship. No. 28 Tom Watson, with less
than a $50,000 cushion, likely will play Walt Disney as his 15th
event for some insurance.
</P>
<P>
   CHIP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   According to Sports Illustrated, Tiger Woods has extended his
contract with International Management Group past 2004, but has
fired agent Huhges Norton because he felt ``overcommitted'' by him.
Norton had negotiated a reported $150 million in endorsements for
Woods. . . . Jim Colbert's emotional Senior tour win Sunday at The
Trans-America was his first since returning from last year's
prostate cancer surgery. Calling it ``by far the most meaningful
golf tournament I've ever won,'' Colbert cited Arnold Palmer's
continuing battle with the disease. ``I felt like I was playing for
both of us.'' . . . Larry Nelson's previously injured neck is
feeling strong enough to caddie for his son, Drew, at first-stage
PGA Tour Qualifying School this week. Jennings Mill Golf Club in
Bogart, Ga., is the local first-stage site, concluding play Friday.
. . . Corey Pavin, who managed a second top 10 finish at Kingsmill,
has parted ways with long-time caddie Eric Schwarz. . . . With Nick
Faldo having broken up with both his teacher (David Leadbetter) and
girlfriend (Brenna Cepelak), it's been suggested that caddie Fannie
Sunesson might be wise to offer her boss pinpoint yardages from now
on. . . . Denise Kileen (3-under-par 285) was among 24 LPGA players
earning full exemption for 1999 through Q-school at the LPGA
International course in Daytona Beach, Fla. Vicki Goetze Ackerman
(297) missed by eight shots and tied for the last spot of
conditional exemption, joining Augusta, Ga.'s Mitzi Edge. . . .
Stopping at East Lake following the recent Buick Challenge were top
30 members Billy Mayfair and Bob Estes.

 &HT;    It wasn't the big homer, but all the 'little' things
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Finally, this is the year we should rid ourselves of
the old barnacle that goes, ''No team three games down has ever
come back to win a playoff or World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   You'll notice I said should, not will. Prognostication is not my
forte, beyond predicting the next sunrise. When Bruce Bochy went to
the mound Monday night to reel in Kevin Brown, you could see the
dagger between his shoulder blades. What he had done was go for it
all. Put all his chips on the table.
</P>
<P>
   He had defied logic in the sixth inning when he could have
walked Michael Tucker and pitched to John Smoltz, but Tucker
singled off Andy Ashby for one of the five runs he batted in. Now
it was Brown, Padres ace, or nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
   The move came up snake-eyes. Not that it was Tucker's home run
alone. Somewhat lost in the pandemonium was Tony Graffanino's
double that scored John Rocker, and then himself on the throw that
detoured wide of the plate. That was the safety net between winning
or losing when Greg Myers delivered a two-run homer in the Padres'
last bat.
</P>
<P>
   (Remember that name, Greg Myers? He made a pit stop in Atlanta
when the Braves exchanged a minor league prospect with Minnesota
for him, too late for the postseason, then released him.)
</P>
<P>
   What Bochy had done was take Brown out of the sixth game today,
brilliant a gamble as it appeared to be when the Macon, Georgian
strode in from this bullpen. It was a given. It was over. The
television cast was packing to make a getaway. But wait a minute,
what is this?
</P>
<P>
   Brown was having trouble throwing where he aimed. He went to
several long counts and never got into a rhythm, I think they call
it. Keep in mind, no pitcher is unhittable. The abrupt swing of fan
emotion was excruciatingly depicted by camera vignettes of San
Diegans in the stands, from ecstasy to grief. I don't think I've
ever seen a more riveting ball game in my life, no matter who won.
</P>
<P>
   What this does, then, is wipe out Brown until the seventh game.
It sets up the Braves with Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux to stretch
it to seven games and end it there. It was dramatic doings when
Bobby Cox sent for Maddux to put out the fire in the ninth,
reaching for his own ace in a moment of desperation.
</P>
<P>
   This was oldtime baseball managing. In the days of baggy
britches and train travel, managers never hesitated to call on
their ace when in need. Start one day, work out of the bullpen the
next. The great Walter Johnson came out of the bullpen and saved
the World Series for Washington in 1924. One of the bulls of
pitching was a Texan named Firpo Marberry, as foreboding as his
name, who often started as many times as he relieved in a season.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux got his work done in 13 pitches, so it was no more than
throwing between games. That sets him up for the finale. Meantime,
say this for Bochy, his managing in this series would surely have
turned up roses had Tony Gwynn pulled his oar. When the finest
batsman of the decade is hitting .190, your offense has one hand
tied behind its back. All he had to do is hit his weight, which
appears to be approaching a ton.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, carrying on in lockstep is the Braves' Venezuelan
Connection, Andres Galarraga one day, Ozzie Guillen every day.
Guillen is the steal of the year, from the streets of Baltimore to
a World Series, the way it looks from this chair.

 &HT;    King, Eliades reach agreement on unification bout
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Promoter Don King, blamed by rivals last year for
derailing a heavyweight title unification between Evander Holyfield
and Lennox Lewis, Tuesday became the biggest reason the fight is on
the verge of taking place.
</P>
<P>
   King reached a promotional agreement with Panos Eliades, who
represents Lewis, on division of profits and has agreed, after
prodding by Holyfield attorney Jim Thomas, to accept a percentage
of potential profits instead of a guarantee. That stunned Time
Warner sports president Seth Abraham, cognizant that King asked to
be guaranteed $5 million last December when Holyfield-Lewis
negotiations fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield and Lewis likely will meet in early March in Las
Vegas. King, joining members of Lewis' camp at a news conference in
London Tuesday night, announced ``the fight is on.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and Abraham denied it's a done deal but expressed
optimism negotations could be completed as early as Thursday, when
all parties meet in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be close because Don even wished my daughter a happy
bat mitzvah,'' said Abraham, a former business partner of King's
but a vocal target in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said he was ``guardedly optimistic,'' adding, ``I don't
anticipate a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner, which would distribute the fight on pay-per-view,
will guarantee Holyfield $20 million and Lewis $8 million, and is
open to giving Holyfield a share of profits from pay-per-view
sales.
</P>
<P>
   One hangup is Henry Akinwande, who is due an immediate mandatory
title shot with Holyfield by the WBA. His manager, J.C. Courreges,
said he is open to allowing Holyfield-Lewis to take place on the
condition that Akinwande be given a shot at the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Akinwande also may be given ``step-aside'' money and/or a fight
on the Holyfield-Lewis undercard.

 &HT;    Georgia's post-season hopes could hinge on weekend matchupsBy
Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite their quick rise to national prominence, the Georgia
women's soccer team hasn't yet developed a reputation for winning
in the clutch. This season, they've been hit with injuries and have
had some tough luck, but two key home SEC matches this weekend
could give them the chance to set their post-season ambitions in
order.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Bulldogs (7-3-1), ranked 23rd this week in the Soccer
Buzz poll, play host to Kentucky Friday at 4 p.m., then entertain
No. 8 Vanderbilt on Sunday at 2 p.m. Georgia, tied with Kentucky
for fourth in the SEC East with a 2-2 conference mark, could clinch
a spot in next month's SEC tournament with a win in either of their
final two home conference matches.
</P>
<P>
   Regaining some momentum, as well as some key players who have
been out, is also a priority. ``We're not at full strength at all,
and we're playing quite well,'' coach Bill Barker said. ``We're not
unhappy with anything we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia let a tie game slip away before suffering a 2-1 loss at
sixth-ranked Portland two weeks ago, and tied at Washington after
hitting the woodwork several times.
</P>
<P>
   Both results were reasonable given that the Lady Dogs were
playing without All-American defender Stephanie Yarem, who scored
18 goals last year but has just one so far because of a stress
fracture in her foot. She hasn't played since Georgia lost at
Florida last month, and the likelihood of her return is evaluated
``day by day,'' Barker said. Also affected by injuries have been
defender Danielle Jordan, midfielders Ali Comis and Jen Lewis and
forward Suzannah Weathersbee.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the LadyDogs have found their new confines at the
Georgia Soccer Stadium to their liking. They were 6-0 there before
Tuesday's home match with the College of Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   Rowing news
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Tech rowing team will take part at the Head of the
Charles in Boston this weekend along with other college teams,
international championship teams and high school teams from the
United States and around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day event along the Charles River in Massachussetts is
the most prestigious race in the fall and the largest single
sporting event in the world. Tech's rowing team, which currently
competes as a club sport, was accepted via a lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honor to row with such great athletes,'' head coach
Rob Canavan said. ``This will indicate how good a team we will have
in the spring. If we have a good showing, we might get considered
for varsity status.''
</P>
<P>
   On a roll
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia State women's soccer team takes a nine-match
unbeaten streak into a home match Friday afternoon against TAAC
West rival Troy State. The Lady Panthers are 9-1-1 and have gotten
nine goals from forward Chandra Yorgason, four of them
game-winners.

 &HT;    Hamilton back on track after QB job was almost lost
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Tech offensive coordinator Ralph Friedgen
reserves the right to talk a little smack on the practice field,
especially to quarterback Joe Hamilton, the trigger man for his
creations and the heartbeat of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Five days before the biggest game of Hamilton's college football
career, against No. 7 Virginia, Friedgen got in his junior
quarterback's ear during a practice Monday night and jokingly told
him he gets intimidated in the big games.
</P>
<P>
   That's progress.
</P>
<P>
   This time during last year's stretch of critical games, Hamilton
was getting an earful about bad decisions and benches. Heading into
the Virginia game last year, Hamilton was coming off maybe the
worst start of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Tech coach George O'Leary threatened to bench him for backup
Brandon Shaw during the North Carolina game. Hamilton had committed
the Friedgen cardinal sin, throwing up a prayer over the middle and
hoping something good would happen. He was intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most I ever got down on him was after the North Carolina
game,'' Friedgen said. ``He really played poorly. He's even started
out poorly in some games this year, but now he has the ability to
right himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, who hasn't thrown a ball like that since, didn't think
his starting spot was in jeopardy but knew he was letting the team
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, I thought I was doing what I could do,''
Hamilton said. ``Then I realized if the offense isn't scoring, the
quarterback is to blame. After that, I saw myself differently. I
wasn't doing what was expected. The morning after that game in my
room, I was thinking 'What can I do to help the team?' I decided I
wasn't getting everybody involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Wake Forest in the second game of last season, Hamilton
had thrown an interception in the first half that was returned for
a touchdown. He threw three touchdown passes in the second half,
helping Tech escape with a 28-26 win, but had a hard time shaking
off his bad play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole first half, that's all that was going through my
head was the interception: 'What am I going to do now?' `` he said.
``It's still a process. I'm still growing. But it's becoming less
and less of a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton threw seven interceptions in the first seven games last
year. He's had two in the 10 games since. He leads the ACC and is
ranked eighth nationally in passing efficiency. Much of that has to
do with his confidence and his grasp of this offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if George (O'Leary) would have thought he could
be as far along mentally as he is now,'' Friedgen said. ``Knowing
fronts, knowing coverages, checks, automatics. We'll go into a game
with probably as much or more (plays) than any level I've been on,
college or pro. Sometimes I think I put too much in.''
</P>
<P>
   When first learning Friedgen's offense last year, Hamilton would
get mixed up in the huddle, calling the wrong play with the wrong
formation. Last year, he was getting grades in the 60s and 70s on
Friedgen's Friday night game plan tests. The last two weeks, he's
aced them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes better decisions, he's not pressing to make the play
all the time,'' Friedgen said. ``He has confidence he'll do it.
Once something good happens to him, he keeps getting better. . .
The things he's doing right now, he's putting our whole team in a
position to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   While trying to stay on top of the offense and handle media
responsibilities, Hamilton has raised his grades, maintaining a 2.5
GPA for the last several quarters. He also endured the first real
loss of his life, when his grandmother died in July. He has
dedicated this season to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's come a long way, not just in football,'' Friedgen said.
``He's a heck of a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates see a more mature Hamilton, a leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what this team would do if it weren't for Joe
Hamilton,'' punter Rodney Williams said. ``Not just on the field.
If he got hurt, we'd survive just because he was on the sideline.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton hasn't told his teammates about his personal goals for
the season: first-team All-ACC, conference player of the year, zero
interceptions. The last one may be out, but he still has a shot at
the other two.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton has been getting his due around the conference, but he
is never mentioned among elite college quarterbacks nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you don't hear your name, it makes you think, 'Whatever
happened to me in the mix?' `` Hamilton said. ``It challenges me
inside. Let's get it going, show people there's a quarterback at
Georgia Tech who loves to win and will do anything to win.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows the Virginia game, along with Florida State on Oct. 25,
will go a long way in meeting his personal and team goals. And if
he momentarily forgets, he always has Friedgen there to remind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't really accomplished anything yet,'' Friedgen said.
``We've been a good team, but to be a great team, these are the
people we've got to beat. He's got to be the guy to make the plays
that does it.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what Friedgen may say on the practice field, he
thinks Hamilton can do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any doubt about that,'' Friedgen said.

 &HT;    Donnan turns to Sanks to nurse running game to health
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ With his team facing two of the SEC's worst
defenses in as many weeks, Georgia coach Jim Donnan says his
running game will be back. And it appears the Bulldogs will look to
a freshman to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   No, not Jasper Sanks, the former Parade All-American from Carver
High in Columbus, whose season all but appears headed toward a
redshirt year. ``He still doesn't have the speed outside he had in
high school,'' Donnan says.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Georgia will probably turn to redshirt freshman Nick
Callaway, a former state sprint champion from Washington-Wilkes
High.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs, who host winless Vanderbilt this week and then
travel to Kentucky on Oct. 24, will need a strong running game if
they'll have any shot at upsetting No. 5 Florida for the second
straight year. The Gators, who meet Georgia in Jacksonville on Oct.
31, are second nationally against the run, allowing only 68.7 yards
per game.
</P>
<P>
   Callaway, a 5-foot-10, 191-pounder, is comparable to former
Bulldogs runner Torin Kirtsey, who led the Dogs with 603 rushing
yards in 1995. Callaway, the state's Class AA 200-meter state
champion in '96, rushed for 1,014 yards as a prep senior.
</P>
<P>
   Callaway has rushed for 71 yards on only 10 carries this season,
averaging more than 10 yards per attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Callaway) gives us a speed guy that can utilize a little of
our perimeter game that we're going to try and exploit the next
couple of weeks,'' Donnan said.
</P>
<P>
   His promotion comes just days after Georgia rushed for a
season-low 59 yards in its 22-3 loss to No. 4 Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Donnan appears fed up with junior Patrick Pass, a prep
All-American at Tucker High in 1995, who left the Tennessee game
with a sprained ankle after only one carry. Pass, bothered by turf
toe earlier this season, has rushed for only 101 yards in four
games, averaging just 3.9 yards per carry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't say much about that (Pass' status),'' Donnan
said. ``I just don't know. He doesn't have much swelling, but he
told me that it's still real sore. It's on the opposite foot of his
turf toe. It's really perplexing for all of us because he's got a
lot of ability, but you've got to go out there and do it. ... He's
a big-play guy, but he hasn't made the big plays.''
</P>
<P>
   For any of Georgia's backs to be successful, the Bulldogs must
find consistent play from the offensive line. Freshman quarterback
Quincy Carter was under constant pressure by the Vols, who sacked
him three times.
</P>
<P>
   Donnan admits he made a ``tactical error'' in not starting Jonas
Jennings at center. Junior Miles Luckie of Stone Mountain, slowed
by a badly bruised right knee, was named the starter just minutes
before last week's game. Jennings remained at right guard until
moving to center for the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the wrong call,'' Donnan said.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings, a 6-foot-4, 310-pound sophomore from College Park,
will probably start at center this week, with Luckie still slowed
by the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think not having a running game is more of the coaches'
choice,'' Jennings said. ``When you look at the big backs around
the league, they're all getting like 37 carries a game. We've run
the ball, but we haven't pounded it. Our backs have gotten like 30
carries, but they're splitting them up between four people.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnan promises more running plays in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the big factor is that we're going to have to call the
game around the running game,'' he said. ``We've looked to throw
the ball more than to (run) it. When you do that you're not very
patient and you don't run two or three runs in a row. We're going
to run two or three runs in a row this week, and play around our
defense to win.''

 &HT;    Vaughn ready to rejoin lineup in Game 6By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Greg Vaughn thinks he's ready to jump back into the
San Diego lineup.
</P>
<P>
   So does manager Bruce Bochy.
</P>
<P>
   That means finally, a week after straining his left quadricep
muscle on the rain-slick Turner Field grass in Game 1, the Padres'
top power hitter returns today to the NLCS. Vaughn struck out in a
pinch-hitting role Monday night in Game 5, but the return of his
potent bat to the Padres' lineup couldn't come at a more opportune
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be ready to play, yeah,'' said Vaughn, after the Padres
failed to clinch the National League title in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's all set to go,'' Bochy said.
</P>
<P>
   The right-handed hitting Vaughn has fared well in his brief
experience against lefty Tom Glavine, collecting two doubles in six
at-bats. And the Padres need his menacing presence in the middle of
the order, even though John Vander Wal and Ruben Rivera have filled
in capably at the bat and in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine yanking Andres Galarraga or Chipper Jones from the
Braves' lineup. That's what Vaughn meant to the Padres during the
regular season. With his 50 homers and 119 RBIs, he'd have been an
MVP candidate if not for the monster numbers put up by Sammy Sosa
and Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   So Vaughn, the cousin of Boston Red Sox slugger Mo Vaughn,
figures to settle for the comeback player of the year. His average
jumped from .216 to .272, while his home run and RBI totals more
than doubled.
</P>
<P>
   How bad was last season? Not only was he platooned in left field
until Rickey Henderson was traded in August, but when the Padres
tried to peddle him to the New York Yankees, they called off the
deal after taking a closer look at Vaughn's scarred shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   He played a year of football as a strong safety at the
University of Miami and was a standout on the baseball team for
three seasons, barely suffering a scratch in either sport. By his
count, he's undergone nine baseball-related surgeries as a pro,
including five shoulder operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time of the Yankee deal, it didn't really faze me,''
Vaughn said. ``I mean, what else could go wrong? I wanted to show
people I could play, and that just topped it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew what I could do. I just never had the chance. I
was always in and out of the lineup. When I came here (in 1996 from
Milwaukee), I said: 'Just give me 500 at-bats, then judge me.' I
was being judged on being in the lineup twice a week.''
</P>
<P>
   The same fans who applauded his every move this year were
expressing their displeasure last season. He was booed anytime he
failed to supply the pop for which he was acquired. And as he
tensed up, uncertain when his next start might come, his stride
lengthened and his hitting mechanics fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Vaughn stayed as upbeat as possible. He kept his
anxieties to himself. He talked regularly with Mo Vaughn, his
cousin with the Boston
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to help myself,'' he explained. ``Everybody was trying
to tell me different things. I didn't want to cause a problem with
the manager or other people around here.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, I always knew what I could do. Two years ago, I had 41
homers (31 in Milwaukee, 10 in San Diego). I had 30 in '93 with
Milwaukee. They had just never seen it here because I never had a
chance to play everyday.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the Padres saw for themselves. Today they hope
to see it again.

 &HT;    Don't be so quick to criticize Atlanta's fans
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Let's see if we've got this straight. It's not enough
that the customer goes elbow-deep into his change purse to buy the
product. No, he must shout appreciation at the top of his lungs for
the privilege of being a consumer. He must prove his worth.
</P>
<P>
   Is that what critics mean when branding the Braves fans slackers
and ingrates?
</P>
<P>
   Applying these same thoughts to other local enterprises, we must
conclude that you Waffle House patrons are the worst. The booths
are seldom filled, and nearly everyone takes for granted the pecans
in the waffles.
</P>
<P>
   And don't even get me started about that Home Depot crowd. Those
people never get geeked when buying a dimmer switch.
</P>
<P>
   What rubbish. Isn't this claptrap about the blase Braves fans
getting awfully tired? They'll come and cheer when they're darn
good and ready.
</P>
<P>
   I'll start criticizing people for not attending playoff games
the day they deduct the price of admission from my paycheck. They
raised the price of my postseason package, too _ but two times
nothing remains nothing. For the fan, not going actually is a rare
act of fiscal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, a team that draws 3.3 million souls to a devalued
regular season gets more than enough emotional fiber in its diet.
</P>
<P>
   A team that plays in an antiqued palace, that performs to a
far-flung cable audience, that can barely get through its clubhouse
door for the piles of money stacked outside has no reason to worry
about where its next tomahawk chop is coming from.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blase'' comes from the French, but that doesn't mean it's a
dirty word. Some of my best friends are blase. And they really
don't care what you think.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, as a matter of fact, Braves fans are blase. They've earned
the right.
</P>
<P>
   Those San Diego people can get worked up once every 14 years,
and then go back to worshipping the Weather Channel and an
unchanging local forecast. In Chicago, they can't help themselves
because their little club is so danged cute. Every day is Beanie
Baby day. But, here, the last eight years have brought so many
victories that the folks in the seats can't help but be jaded.
Winning is like a drug, and the addict is always looking for a
higher high.
</P>
<P>
   It boils down to the simple fact that the fan owes nothing to no
one. Just be somewhat civil and don't interfere with a ball in
play. It's not hard.
</P>
<P>
   The team's job is to light the fans' fire, not vice versa.
There's the heavy-handed process _ known as the David Justice
Method. And there is playing your way into their affections, which
the Braves currently are attempting.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than just trying to win a game, the Braves are looking to
rewrite history. Staging late-inning outbursts two nights in a row,
they audition to become the first ever to rise from the grave of
0-3. Coming off a game that baseball coroners could spend years
cutting into, the Braves have brought to life all the numbed
senses. It took a desperate plight, but there is a little of that
1991 feeling all over again _ this time with John Rocker playing a
poor man's Sid Bream.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry about the Braves fans. They'll show up today for
Game Six. They'll come to play. They'll scream their fool heads
off, they'll ride the emotional Tilt-A-Whirl, they'll profoundly
care. And matter as little in the final reckoning as when they
didn't.

 &HT;    Bits and pieces from the NLCS
 &HT;    By Tim Tucker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Reading between the lines of the NLCS. . . .
</P>
<P>
   _ You realize that the Braves' winning pitchers in this series
have been a 43-year-old grandfather who a year ago was out of the
game (Dennis Martinez) and a 24-year-old rookie who a year ago was
passed over in the expansion draft (John Rocker)?
</P>
<P>
   _ Rocker has become a big story in the series. While fellow
rookie Kerry Ligtenberg has struggled, Rocker has sprinted into all
five games and allowed nothing _ one hit, one walk, no runs, five
strikeouts _ in 4 2/3 innings; heck, he has scored more runs (one)
than he has allowed. Until this season, the excitable lefty had
caused barely a stir in the Atlanta farm system. But the other day,
when Padres GM Kevin Towers was discussing the Braves' penchant
throughout the '90s of producing new homegrown stars, he mentioned
Chipper Jones, Javy Lopez, Ryan Klesko, Andruw Jones . . . and
Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   _ ''I turned to John Smoltz at one point in the dugout,'' the
postseason novice Rocker said, ''and told him, 'I don't know how
you guys go through this every year. I'd have an ulcer by now.'''
But the postseason isn't entirely new to Rocker, who was in the
stands at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium with his dad during the '92
World Series. He was a high school junior in Macon then.
</P>
<P>
   _ Speaking of Macon, that's home to both the winning and losing
pitchers in Game 5, Rocker and Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   _ The home team has won one of five games so far.
</P>
<P>
   _ That four-time Cy Young winner looked pretty good as a closer.
''He touched 91 (mph),'' Bobby Cox said of Greg Maddux's
ninth-inning performance in Game 5. ''I've never seen him throw 91
before.'' Maddux, though, admitted some culture shock in the
bullpen: ''I felt like a fish out of water down there. I didn't
know what to do, how to act, what to say.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Asked if Smoltz, who had terrific stuff in his Game 5 start,
will be available in relief if needed in Game 7, Cox said: ''Game
6.''
</P>
<P>
   _ No telling what'll happen in this wacky series next. But in
one respect the Padres' use of Brown in relief on Monday puts them
in the same bind that the Cardinals faced in the '96 NLCS in which
the Braves overcame a three-games-to-one deficit. Two of Atlanta's
wins in that series came against pitchers working on
shorter-than-usual rest.
</P>
<P>
   _ ''The reason I felt we could do it in 1996,'' Braves GM John
Schuerholz said, referring to the comeback against the Cards, ''is
the same reason I think we can do it now: Smoltz and Glavine and
Maddux.'' And then he added that he believes this team's offense is
better _ ''more balanced; greater left-handed, right-handed
balance'' _ than the one that scored 32 runs in the last three
games against St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   _ The big difference offensively between the first three games
of this series and the last two? Patience and working the count in
their favor, according to Braves hitters.
</P>
<P>
   _ ''Somebody asked me before the series who the star would be,''
Cox said, ''and I said, 'Someone you wouldn't think of.'''
</P>
<P>
   _ Wally Joyner, the Padres' first baseman, has played in 1,767
major-league games, and he said of Monday's: ''That might have been
the best game I've ever participated in.''

DISCREPANCY FOUND BETWEEN CANCER DIAGNOSIS AND AUTOPSY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La.)   (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new study has found a substantial discrepancy between the
number of cancers detected during life and those found in
autopsies. Despite advances in medical technology, the disparity
between the diagnosis of cancer before and after death was 44
percent, similar to that found in studies conducted in earlier
decades, said the authors.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which involved 1,105 autopsies performed over the
10-year period from 1986 to 1995 at the Medical Center of Louisiana
in New Orleans, found that 100 patients had developed 111 cancers
that doctors had either not detected or misdiagnosed. In 54 of the
100 patients, the cancer had spread. In 57 of the patients, the
cancer was the most probable cause of death, the authors reported
Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Even in an era of CAT scan X-rays and other high technology
medicine, autopsies remain extremely important because doctors
sometimes do not detect cancers and other conditions during life.
Thus, a recent decline in autopsy rates could be adversely
affecting the quality of health care.
</P>
<P>
   Long known as Charity Hospital, the Medical Center of Louisiana
serves a mainly indigent population, which may not be receiving
adequate health care. The hospital is also a top-level trauma
center. Thus, cancers and other chronic conditions could have been
masked by other more acute problems, Dr. Elizabeth Burton and her
co-authors wrote. One in five of the deceased, who ranged in age
from 4 to 92 years, had cancers at the time of autopsy. But the
report did not address the extent of medical care they received
during life.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the authors wrote, ``The number of inaccurate
clinical diagnoses (attributed to both malignancies and all other
causes) remains alarmingly high.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Dr. Burton said she did not know how
representative her study was of patients who are currently now
being treated in other types of hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   For several reasons, a number of medical leaders have deplored
the plummeting of autopsy rates in American hospitals in recent
years. Rates are now about 5 percent in many community hospitals
compared to 50 percent in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lars Erik Bottiger , a former editor of the Journal of
International Medicine, said in a recent interview in Stockholm
that autopsy rates have declined in Sweden and many other countries
with little agreement as to why. Doctors and hospital officials
have speculated that autopsies are now too costly and an
unnecessary diagnostic tool in this era of high-technology
medicine. But the New Orleans study provides additional evidence to
the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   At 24 percent, the autopsy rate in the study was higher than the
national rate, largely because of an affiliation with the coroner's
office, which has powers to perform an autopsy even if a family
does not give consent. The rate would have been 10 percent without
the coroner's affiliation, the authors said, and ``a significant
number of clinically undiagnosed malignancies may not have been
recorded.''
</P>
<P>
   A principal reason autopsies are performed is to inform family
members about the accuracy of the diagnosis in the deceased and the
quality of that patient's care. However, Dr. Burton said it was not
the practice of the pathologists who performed the autopsies to
call families of the deceased to provide them with the findings,
though the families could seek the autopsy findings on their own or
through their doctors. Dr. Burton also said she did not know how
many of the families learned about the undetected or misdiagnosed
cancers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we directly call the families and give them the results?
No, we do not,'' Dr. Burton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we notify the attending physician?'' Dr. Burton said. ``We
are doing everything within our power to do that now.'' She added
that she did not know if the pathologists who performed the
autopsies were notifying the attending physicians in the
decade-long period of the study.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Burton said she would not know whether any malpractice cases
or disciplinary actions had been taken as a result of the
undetected or misdiagnosed cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Autopsies still are the most important means of determining
whether a death is due to homicide or natural causes. They also
serve many additional purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Among them, the pathology findings can help monitor the
effectiveness of drug therapies and surgical techniques, and they
are an important teaching tool for medical students and doctors.
Autopsies help monitor public health by identifying new diseases
and changes in ones long recognized.

 &HT;    Impeachment movement a main weapon for BarrBy D.L. Bennett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No one has more to thank President Clinton for than
Bob Barr.
</P>
<P>
   First, Barr rode anti-Clinton sentiment into office in 1994 by
hanging the president's unpopularity around the neck of incumbent
Democrat Buddy Darden.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the 7th District incumbent is riding relentless attacks
on the embattled president to national prominence and a likely
third term in Congress representing Georgia's 7th District.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain continuity to it,'' Barr said. ``He's
basically been doing the same things the past several years and I
have also. I have very substantive and serious differences with
this president.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr, 49, is expected to have no difficulty on Nov. 3 defeating
little-known Democratic challenger Jim Williams, an insurance agent
from Cedartown.
</P>
<P>
   The former federal prosecutor was discounted as an extremist
pandering to right-wing voters a year ago when he filed for the
impeachment of Clinton. Early on he had few signing onto the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   But the Starr report made Barr seem like a visionary. The
Georgia Congressman's seat on the Judiciary Committee provided Barr
a bully pulpit he parlayed into appearances on C-SPAN, CNN and
national television news shows.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the full House has voted overwhelmingly to begin a
wide-ranging impeachment inquiry into the president's affairs. And
Barr remains at the forefront.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear from an awful lot of people on a daily basis and the
sentiment is very strongly in support of making the president
accountable,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 55, admits he is a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   A Polk County commissioner from 1973-77, Williams is virtually
unknown in the 11-county district which spans west Georgia from
Troupe County north to Catoosa County and east into parts of south
and west Cobb County..
</P>
<P>
   He says many Democrats have called with moral support, but few
are willing to open their wallets to fund a little-known challenger
in a solidly Republican district. And, with just $10,000, he won't
be running pricey television commercials or plastering the district
with yard signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least he had the courage to step forward and take on this
right-wing Goliath,'' said Bill Waldrop, Cobb Democratic Party
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is hoping Barr's pit-bull fierceness in attacking the
president will create a backlash that will catapult the Democratic
challenger into Congress. He started the campaign with the slogan,
``Stop the madness, send a moderate to Washington.'' But has
changed that to ``Stop Bob Barr and the radical right, send a
moderate to Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mainly, the issue is Bob Barr himself and the impeachment
issue. . . people don't like it,'' Williams said. ``Barr has just
totally ignored the district from Day 1 with his drive to impeach
the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Some constituents agree.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Bryant, a lumber salesman from Cartersville, said he voted
for Barr two years ago but won't again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing has really turned into a witch hunt,'' Bryant said
. ``They should really get on with the business of running the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Vaughan, a farmer from White, agreed. He said he had no
interest in the Starr report and no desire to see Clinton
impeached. ``I won't vote for Barr next time for that reason,''
Vaughan said.
</P>
<P>
   But the impeachment stand has played well for Barr in much of
the staunchly conservative district.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Farris, a Douglasville CPA and former Douglas County
commissioner, likes Barr's efforts to remove Clinton. He said Barr
has remained faithful to his district by returning regularly and
providing good constituent services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob has been exactly what we expected,'' Farris said. ``I like
the fact that he's a good solid conservative Republican who does
what he says he's going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Williams' situation, Barr's supporters have opened their
wallets.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Barr's Federal Election Commission campaign disclosure
report will show he has raised more than $1 million and has
$170,000 on hand, his aides said.
</P>
<P>
   The huge fund-raising lead has allowed Barr to be generous. He
has given $6,000 to various GOP congressional candidates and
another $9,000 to Republican candidates for state House and Senate.

 &HT;    HBO earnings surpass analysts' estimatesBy Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ HBO &AMP; Co. beat analysts' earnings estimates, reporting
a 57 percent increase in third-quarter net income Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based health care software and services company
announced a profit of $83.7 million, or 19 cents a share, against
$53.2 million, or 12 cents, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue
climbed to $399.6 million from $307.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus analyst estimate, according to First Call, was 18
cents a share. Despite beating that number, HBO &AMP; Co. shares
slipped 37 1/2 cents to $26.56 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attributed the decline to the Nasdaq market's slump.
And typically, HBO &AMP; Co.'s shares rise in the days before an
earnings announcement, then fall off.
</P>
<P>
   The company leads the health-care information technology sector
in revenue and profit.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Michael Samols of BancBoston Robertson Stephens said HBO
&AMP; Co.'s growth should continue at least through 1999. ``Health care
must invest more in (information) systems to be more
cost-effective,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter, HBO &AMP; Co. said software sales rose in each
market segment -- hospitals, health systems, physicians, home care
and insurers. The company said profitability increased more than
revenue because of efficiency gains and cost containment.
</P>
<P>
   For the nine months, HBO &AMP; Co., with headquarters at Perimeter
Center, had income of $222.4 million, or 51 cents a share, on sales
of $1.12 billion. For the nine-month period in 1997, income was
$139 million, or 33 cents a share, on revenue of $862 million,
excluding a nonrecurring charge of $35.4 million, or 5 cents a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Monika Brown, director of investor relations, said HBO &AMP; Co. is
comfortable with analysts' estimates of 20 cents a share for the
fourth quarter.

 &HT;    Longshot or not, Littman up to the challenge
 &HT;    By Peter J. Kent
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What does a long-distance truck driver think about as
the miles roll under his 18-wheel rig?
</P>
<P>
   Vince Littman of Commerce imagines himself in Congress, serving
as the U.S. representative from Georgia's 11th District.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent evening Littman appeared at a political forum in
Jackson County. Next stop was Miami, hauling a load of office
equipment from North Bergen, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be gone the rest of the week,'' said Littman, an
underfunded political novice taking aim at Republican Party
heavyweight U.S. Rep. John Linder of Chamblee.
</P>
<P>
   Littman, a 52-year-old native New Yorker with the accent to
prove it, knows he's a longshot, but says he passionately believes
that no incumbent should go unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if I didn't have a chance, I would still be out there
because without me there is no race,'' Littman said.
</P>
<P>
   Political observers say Littman is a really long shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in their right mind would want to run against Linder,''
said Keith Billingsley, a University of Georgia political
scientist. ``He is in a tremendously influential position.''
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee,
Linder controls the fate of GOP House candidates, dispensing
campaign money and advice. Linder also is a member of the House
Rules Committee, which controls the flow of legislation in the
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   And Linder has access. ``His real importance is he meets with
the Speaker (Newt Gingrich) constantly. People know that when he is
speaking it is really the Speaker doing the talking,'' Billingsley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the 11th District, stretching from South Carolina to
north metro Atlanta, was drawn as a ``safe seat'' for the GOP,
Billingsley said: ``I believe that somebody in jail could win this
district if he were a Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   To Linder, who is not planning any TV advertising, there are no
issues in this race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public is quite content,'' he said in an interview.
``Approval ratings for Congress are the highest ever. This will be
status-quo election. It will be a light turnout.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Linder works to maintain his popularity. ``He is in the
district a lot,'' said Gwinnett County Republican chairman B.J. Van
Gundy, listing a schedule filled with GOP breakfasts and town hall
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Littman, a high school graduate who works for Graebel Atlanta
Movers, has been in this territory before. After moving his family
to Commerce in 1993, he was angered by the district-swapping that
took place among incumbents after Georgia's congressional map was
thrown out by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know who was going to represent us,'' Littmann
recalled. ``I went to a local Republican Party meeting _ it's the
only party meeting they have up here _ and I asked who was going to
our representative. They told me it was probably going to Linder,
who then represented the 4th Congressional District. I said he
didn't even live in the district. Apparently a deal had been made,
with Cynthia McKinney moving from 11th to the 4th and Linder
running in the 11th.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said if I didn't like, to challenge him.''
</P>
<P>
   So in 1996, Littmann borrowed money to pay the qualifying fee
and ran in the Democratic primary. He was trounced by Tommy
Stephenson, former Commerce mayor and state lawmaker, who won 74
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Facing no primary opposition this time, Littman carries little
more than his party's banner. He has received no money from the
state or national Democratic Party. He again took out a bank loan
to pay the $4,101 qualifying fee. Littman said he has gotten a few
donations, including a $50 check he had in his wallet. His war
chest is so meager that his accountant told him he did not have to
report his campaign fiinances to federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   Linder has about $520,000 in campaign money, according Federal
Election Commission reports.
</P>
<P>
   But Littman is undaunted. He says he is on the campaign trail
for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just not going to quit,'' Littman said. ``Someone must
run against Linder, and someone will as long as Vinnie is here. I
will make him a better congressman.''

 &HT;    Georgia prison finally privitizedBy Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After two false starts, the first group of Georgia
prisoners is finally in custody of corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   The much-heralded privatization of the state's prison system
began Tuesday when 24 medium-security inmates arrived at D. Ray
James State Prison in Folkston. The prison, owned and operated by
Cornell Corrections Inc. of Houston, will get 50 inmates a week
until there are 750.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got everybody on their jobs,'' said Warden Lowell
Hudson. ``Everything is secure that needs to be secure.''
</P>
<P>
   The inmates were chosen for the private prison near the boundary
of the Okefenokee Swamp because of their job skills, mostly kitchen
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the prison was supposed to start taking inmates in
mid-August but construction delays pushed that date back twice.
</P>
<P>
   The Charlton County prison is the first of three planned for
Georgia that will be owned and operated by publicly traded
corporations. The other company _ Corrections Corp. of America _ is
building similar prisons in Wheeler and Coffee Counties. All three
have a 1,600-inmate capacity. Both companies have said they will
take inmates from other states if Georgia does not want to lease
the additional beds.

 &HT;    Sales dip for fashion houses
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS, France _ These are pressure-filled times fashion
designers live in.
</P>
<P>
   Adrienne Vittadini's just announced that she can no longer take
the business strain and will resign as her company's design chief
and chairwoman. Lagging sales of Isaac Mizrahi's designs cost him
his French financial backing, so his 10-year-old business is
closing. The LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy) corporation _ which
owns Louis Vuitton, Givenchy, Christian Dior and Celine, among
other brands _ reports its sales are down $1 billion from a year
ago. And Benetton's grown so needy for market share that its
entering into partnership with Sears.
</P>
<P>
   Into this atmosphere of intense scrutiny and doubt comes the
start of the French spring/summer '99 previews. Designers here need
``good spin'' from fashion critics.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard, though, to fathom what prompted the waves of applause
following the preview of Dries Van Noten's spring/summer '99
designs on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The standing-room-only crowd gathered in a baroque theatre
overshadowed by the Arc de Triomphe approved of Van Noten's stark
departure from the spring/summer styles shown already by his
counterparts in New York, London, Milan and Paris. The bulk of Van
Noten's collection resembled what women wore to work in wild west
bordellos. The few outfits Van Noten showed that looked modern,
sleek, colorful and pretty were outnumbered by ensembles that
appeared antiquated, cumbersome, somber and plain.
</P>
<P>
   Van Noten, a brash Belgian with a reputation for avante garde
tendencies, took the stance that there will be far too much color
flooding the stores when warm weather returns. The most colorful
aspects of his show were: the towering Marilyn Manson look-alikes
posted at the entrance to pass out Chupa Chups lollipops; and just
a few peasant blouses and skirts shaded fuscia and mauve.
</P>
<P>
   There was delicacy to some of Van Noten's crinkley fabrications.
But, overall, his styling looked too contrived and impractical for
the modern woman's wardrobing needs.
</P>
<P>
   A youthful, slim womancould, on the other hand, build her entire
wardrobe around the collection shown by the relatively unknown
Christophe LeMaire. LeMaire showed spring/summer clothes that were
highly wearable, if not entirely innovative.
</P>
<P>
   All the requisite facets of modernity _ drawstrings, zippered
pockets, hoods, snap closures, and flat-soled shoes _ were evident
in LeMaire's sporty collection. But he betrayed himself as too much
of a trend-follower by draping pouch-pocketed bandoliers over a few
of his models' shoulders; harkening images of the utilitarian
``body bags'' that Helmut Lang, Miuccia Prada and others have
already shown.
</P>
<P>
   Using iridescent olive, black and brown as his color base,
LeMaire accented his collection with lime, fuscia and aqua and
cobalt shades of blue. His pants _ in both Capris and full lenths _
looked snug but stretchy. His skirts were curve-huggers as well,
with slits up the front and knee-length hems. His jackets spanned
the gamut from athletic to business appropriate. And his
paperweight, shawl-collared blouses looked at once retro and
futuristic.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between the Van Noten and LeMaire collections is
telling. Van Noten's already earned enough acclaim to indulge in
unwearable whimsy from time to time. LeMaire, who's still seeking
industry approval, assumed the safer posture of a copycat.

 &HT;    Fees help boost SunTrust's earnings 12%
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A 25.9 percent jump in fee-based earnings propelled
SunTrust Banks to a 12 percent gain in third-quarter net income.
Profit rose to $188.8 million from $168.6 million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Net per share grew 13.8 percent on fewer shares, to 91 cents
against 80 cents per share a year earlier. The
Atlanta-headquartered company beat First Call's 21-analyst
consensus estimate by a penny per share.
</P>
<P>
   SunTrust Banks, among the first of the major regional banks to
report earnings, closed Tuesday at $64.43 3/4, up 62 1/2 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The company earned $293.2 million from fees. That included trust
income, which climbed 17 percent to $92.5 million. Corporate and
institutional investment income rose 86 percent to $16 million, and
mortgage fees increased 55.7 percent to $19 million.
</P>
<P>
   Interest-based income rose more slowly, a near-universal
experience in the banking industry. That amount was $504.4 million
vs. $485.7 million, a gain of about 4 percent. The net interest
margin _ what a bank earns on money minus what it costs to obtain
money _ declined to 3.87 percent from 4.04 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nonperforming loans were $157.7 million, down $33 million. The
provision for possible bad loans increased slightly, to $31.4
million from $29 million. Loan charge-offs for the quarter were
$27.9 million, or 0.26 percent of average loans.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman James C. Armstrong said SunTrust Banks has no exposure
to hedge funds and that its foreign loans, most of which are in
Canada and the United Kingdom, amount to less that 1 percent of the
overall loan portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   The banking company had a 1.32 percent return on the average
value of its assets and a 22.5 percent return on stockholders'
equity. It cost SunTrust Banks 61.1 cents, up from 59 cents, to
bring in a dollar of revenue. That increase was attributable to a
19.6 percent climb, to $289.2 million, in personnel expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Crestar Financial of Richmond, expected to be merged with
SunTrust Banks by year-end, also reported earnings. In line with
expectations, the company earned $88.9 million, or 78 cents per
share, compared with $79.5 million, or 71 cents.
</P>
<P>
   For the nine months, SunTrust Banks earned $554.7 million, or
$2.64 per share, vs. $495.1 million, or $2.31 per share. As of
Sept. 30, assets totaled $60.7 billion. With the addition of
Crestar Financial, assets would rise to $86.5 billion.

KABC HOST BELL SAYS THREATS FORCING HIM TO QUIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Conspiracy theorist, UFO aficionado and syndicated radio host
Art Bell announced Tuesday he was quitting the airwaves, hinting
that his family was under a mysterious threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you are listening to is my final broadcast,'' Bell told
the audience of his overnight ``Coast to Coast'' call-in show
before signing off about 3 a.m. on local talk outlet KABC-AM (790).
</P>
<P>
   Station officials insist Bell's resignation was not a stunt,
adding that he was not in the midst of contract talks. A KABC
spokeswoman said management was scrambling to find out what was
going on, while a decision had not been made on how to fill Bell's
time slot.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday's broadcast, Bell said ``a threatening, terrible
event occurred to my family, which I could not tell you about.
Because of that event, and a succession of other events, what
you're listening to right now is my final broadcast.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's Lt. Bill Becht said officers were sent to Bell's home
upon learning of the farewell broadcast. They found him there, with
no evidence of foul play, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any threats were not criminal in nature,'' Becht said.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, 51, hosted his radio show from his home in rural Pahrump,
Nev. The program focused on such paranormal activity as alien
abductions, cattle mutilations and secret government programs.
</P>
<P>
   The show was thought to attract more than 6.5 million listeners
on more than 400 stations nationwide. &QL;

KIIS-FM GIVES $1 MILLION-PLUS
</P>
<P>
   Glendale community college student Karolina Khodzhyan feels like
a million bucks, thanks to top-40 KIIS-FM (102.7).
</P>
<P>
   Khodzhyan was awarded a record-breaking $1,000,102.70 by KIIS
morning personality Rick Dees after claiming the winning birth date
in a call-in contest co-sponsored by Rio All Suites Hotel &AMP; Casino
in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy _ and shocked, shocked, shocked,'' said
Armenia-born Khodzhyan, 22, a business major who works as a
receptionist at a medical management firm.
</P>
<P>
   Khodzhyan said she would spend her winnings on a house for her
parents, a car for her younger brother and her own education.
</P>
<P>
   The longtime KIIS listener was at her desk at 9:10 a.m. Sept. 30
when Dees announced her birth date _ Feb. 26, 1976. The 10th caller
with the matching birthday would become an instant millionaire,
Dees said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept dialing and dialing and finally got through,''
Khodzhyan said Monday. ``I couldn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Khodzhyan was accompanied by co-workers and family members when
she went to KIIS' Burbank studios to claim her prize, which could
amount to roughly $620,000 after taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Michaels, chief executive officer of KIIS' parent company,
Kentucky-based Jacor Communications, was program director at
Cincinnati's WKRQ when it set a world record in 1980 for the
largest amount given out in a radio contest _ $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   To break that record, KIIS added $102.70, making Khodzhyan's
gross $1,000,102.70, station spokesman Von Freeman said.
</P>
<P>
   KIIS launched a second search for a $1 million birthday winner
Oct. 7.
</P>
<P>
   GOODBYE GROOVE
</P>
<P>
   Groove 103.1 is gone, and the news isn't good for fans of techno
and dance music.
</P>
<P>
   The Groove stations, Santa Monica's KACD-FM and Newport Beach
simulcast outlet KBCD-FM, were recently purchased for $67 million
by Jacor, which owns 230 properties across the country, including
KIIS.
</P>
<P>
   At noon Monday, the dance music stopped, disc jockeys bade
listeners farewell and a simulcast of KIIS began.
</P>
<P>
   Insiders say the new KACD/KBCD format, to be unveiled next week,
will likely be adult alternative, similar to that of now-defunct
KSCA-FM, which was beloved by its relatively few listeners for
giving airplay to Sarah McLachlan, the Dave Matthews Band, Joni
Mitchell and other acts popular with the boomer crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But in the year since KSCA went off the air, KYSR-FM (98.7) _
Star 98 _ KBIG-FM (104.3) and several other outlets have added
adult alternative artists.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there's now nowhere on the dial to hear the
admittedly low-rated Groove's unique mix of techno, r&AMP;b and
four-on-the-floor dance music.
</P>
<P>
   Over at KACD, nobody's talking just yet.
</P>
<P>
   DYLAN DOCUMENTARY
</P>
<P>
   To coincide with the official release this week of an
oft-bootlegged Bob Dylan concert recording from 1966, the Museum of
Television &AMP; Radio in Beverly Hills is hosting screenings of the
rare Dylan documentary ``Eat the Document.'' Screening times are 6
p.m. Thursday and 1 p.m. Friday, Saturday and Sunday, through Nov.
13. ... Rush Limbaugh is on top among talk hosts, says Talkers
radio trade mag. According to the publication's latest survey,
Limbaugh has at least 15 million weekly listeners, followed by Dr.
Laura Schlessinger with at least 14.5 million and Howard Stern with
at least 9 million. &QL;

STOCK PRICES FALL AS EARNINGS REPORTS MOUNT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices fell Tuesday as the flow of
third-quarter corporate earnings reports began to intensify.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies have prepared investors with preannouncements
about a slide in profits, but investors showed Tuesday that they
were looking at more than just the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Eastman Kodak were pounded after the company reported
a 10 percent drop in revenues, due largely to a decline in sales to
consumers in emerging markets like Russia and China. Even though
revenues sagged, Kodak's net income figures beat analysts'
expectations, due in part to cost reductions.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of report might have cheered Wall Street at other
times, but these are not other times.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are suspicious when companies can't pull out top-line
growth,'' said Henry Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell
&AMP; Reed, a mutual fund company in Overland Park, Kan., with $26
billion in assets under management.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak's stock fell by 11 3/16, or 13 percent, to 72 3/8. That
result was responsible for 73 percent, or 46.1 points, of a 63.33
point decline in the Dow Jones industrial average, which closed at
7,938.14. It also contributed to a much smaller 2.91 point fall in
the broader Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, which closed at
994.80.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two or three years ago, if a company showed improving earnings
growth through lower costs, the market rejoiced,'' said A. Marshall
Acuff, an equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. ``Now the
market senses that the world economy is slowing down, and is
focused on growth in the top line, as well as on profits. Kodak
gave the market a kind of smack in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   Sagging computer share prices dragged down the Nasdaq composite
index, which fell 36.63 points, or 2.37 percent, to 1,509.45.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto was another big contributor to the decline in the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index. Shares of Monsanto fell 13 3/8, or
26.55 percent, to 37, after it said its proposed $35 billion merger
with American Home Products had been canceled. American Home
Products fell 5, to 45.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq stocks were dragged down by computer companies like Dell
Computer, which lost 3 1/16, to 53.
</P>
<P>
   Not every company that reported earnings Tuesday saw its stock
price head lower.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson rose 1 5/16, to 77 3/4, after a solid earnings
report. And Merrill Lynch, which has been clobbered in recent
weeks, rose 1 1/16, to 44 15/16, after it reported a net loss of
$164 million and said it would lay off 3,400 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to imagine things getting a lot worse in the
financial sector,'' Bob Gasser, head of block trading at J.P.
Morgan &AMP; Co., said.
</P>
<P>
   Some market analysts, a group that includes Acuff at Salomon
Smith Barney, said conditions have improved over the last week or
so, and that the Dow is not likely to successfully test its Aug. 31
low.
</P>
<P>
   But Herrmann said he could be happier. ``We have been doing some
buying, especially in small capitalization stocks, but nothing
wholesale,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To feel better, Herrmann said he would like to see long-term
bond yields rise above short-term interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would allow the banking sector to reliquify itself by
extending credit rather than just holding bonds,'' he said. ``I
would also like to get a sense that the hedge fund world, which
includes big money center banks, has finished unwinding its
money-losing trades.''
</P>
<P>
   But even those accomplishments would not do much to help
corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what we do there is going to be material pressure''
on earnings, he said. ``There is such an incredible excess of
supply that companies don't have any pricing power. It will take us
a while to work through that.''

   ATLANTA _ Check printer John H. Harland (ticker symbol JH),
having fallen on hard times, Tuesday hired a turnaround specialist,
Timothy C. Tuff, as president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street greeted the announcement by sending the stock to a
52-week low of $12.25, where it finished, down 18 3/4 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Tuff, 51, who also was elected a director, previously was
president and chief executive of Boral Industries in Atlanta, where
he managed the North American and European operations of Boral
Ltd., a building and construction materials company based in
Australia. Before that, he was general partner of a Massachusetts
venture capital company that focused on spinoffs of
under-performing divisions of large companies. The native of
England also is a former president of Alcan Aluminum Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Tuff couldn't be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken Harland 10 months to find a replacement for Robert
J. Amman, who resigned last January after two years as chief
executive. At the time, Amman cited ``differences of opinion'' over
corporate strategy.
</P>
<P>
   To boost profitability, Amman cut costs by closing plants. He
also sought to transform the company from a checks and forms
printer to a financial marketing services company.
</P>
<P>
   But Harland's financial results often didn't match Wall Street's
expectations, leading to a slump in the price of the shares, which
traded as high as $33 at the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of analysts still cover the stock, which was
removed from the benchmark Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst who still tracks the stock, Joseph A. Gomes of
William Smith &AMP; Co., thinks hiring Tuff is a positive for Harland,
which was founded in 1923.
</P>
<P>
   ``That question is no longer overhanging the company,'' Gomes
said. ``And it looks like he has a pretty strong operating
background, albeit not in the financial services industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Gomes said Harland _ which once had 45 years of sales increases
and 43 years of dividend hikes _ still has a rough road ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financial institutions apparently are cutting back some of
their expenditures, not only with checks but some of the financial
marketing software the company has as well,'' Gomes said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some see value in the shares. Wealthy investor Richard
C. Blum and affiliates recently boosted their holdings to 5.9
percent of the shares outstanding, paying $13.04 to $15.75 apiece
between July 27 and Sept. 3. Blum is married to U.S. Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, a California Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Gomes also likes the stock, predicting it will rebound to $22.
</P>
<P>
   ``The check business, although not a big grower, throws off
tremendous cash flows,'' he said. ``The company also is in the
midst of a restructuring program that should substantially help
earnings when it's completed next year. And it has some attractive
potential growth in its software unit, which allows financial
institutions to better maximize profit from existing customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts generally expect Harland to earn 83 cents a share this
year and $1.20 next year.

GINGRICH PESSIMISTIC ABOUT QUICK AGREEMENT ON BUDGET
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With little to suggest that a deal was at hand,
Congress and the White House continued negotiating Tuesday on a
budget for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, with disputes over
education, agriculture, and military spending among the remaining
roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am much less optimistic than I was this morning,'' House
Speaker Newt Gingrich said during a mid-afternoon break in the
talks, ``because I am beginning to realize how far apart we are on
the question of whether Washington runs the country in detail, or
local citizens have control over their own lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said he was referring only in part to an impasse over
new education funding sought by President Clinton and Democratic
lawmakers, primarily to hire more teachers and to build schools.
Republicans have said they would approve some of the money, but
only if local officials, rather than the federal government, are
allowed to decide how to spend it.
</P>
<P>
   Aiming for a budget deal that the House and Senate could approve
Wednesday, Gingrich, Senate majority leader Trent Lott, and other
congressional leaders met at various times Tuesday with White House
officials, including Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, chief of
staff Erskine Bowles, and Clinton's budget chief, Jack Lew.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having difficult negotiations about very serious
principles,'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said there was a strong chance that negotiators
would revive a measure sought by high-tech companies to allow more
foreign workers into the United States each year to take skilled
jobs, ranging from computer programmers to nurses and doctors. The
White House and congressional leaders had agreed to that bill
several weeks ago, saying it would ease a shortage of computer
workers. But labor groups opposed the measure, and a small group of
senators effectively killed it on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, a senator and a White House official said the
legislation could be attached to a massive ``omnibus'' spending
bill that would also contain what normally would be eight separate
appropriations bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prospects for including this legislation are very good,
and we'd like to see it included,'' said Jake Siewert, spokesman
for the White House National Economic Council. The legislation
would raise the annual quota of so-called H-1B visas, which allow a
foreigner to work at a skilled US job for up to six years. Many
Massachusetts companies backed the measure, but reviving it might
also give a boost to Senator Barbara Boxer, a Democrat from the
high-tech haven of California in a tight reelection race, who
supports the bill.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the omnibus bill would control about $500 billion in
spending for health, education, labor, foreign aid, law
enforcement, and other programs _ nearly one-third of the federal
budget. Lawmakers are writing the omnibus bill under a short-term
spending plan that keeps the government operating only through
midnight tonight. By that time, they must approve a new budget,
pass another temporary spending measure, or provoke a repeat of the
government shutdowns of the winter of 1995-1996.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers are pressing to finish the budget work so they can
return home to campaign for the Nov. 3 elections. The budget, and a
possible modest, companion tax cut are the last major pieces of
business for the 105th Congress, though House members may return to
take up the impeachment inquiry of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   One cause of the delay has been a late push by Clinton and
Democratic lawmakers for several education proposals, including
plans to fund new school construction and to hire 100,000 teachers
over seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators were also discussing a Democratic proposal to spend
$100 million for toxic waste cleanup. They aimed to settle on terms
for sending $18 billion to the International Monetary Fund, the
agency that has loaned money to nations struggling amid the global
economic crisis. Also unresolved was a Democratic proposal to
require most federal workers' health plans to cover prescription
contraceptives. Republicans wanted to let insurers opt out if they
had moral objections.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators also were working out a tax cut package. The House
on Monday voted to renew several expiring tax credits, totaling
$9.2 billion over 10 years. But the Senate has its own $8.4 billion
plan, and Clinton complicated matters by proposing that the package
include tax incentives to allow state and local governments to
issue bonds for school construction.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also has proposed $12 billion or more in so-called
emergency spending, ranging from aid to farmers to money for
federal computer upgrades. That spending package has been growing
in recent days and may include other programs, bringing the
administration's total price tag as high as $20 billion.
Republicans want to spend about $7 billion on improving military
preparedness, a new missile defense system, and other items.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's office said the senator was working to persuade budget
negotiators to include a five-year, $100 million boost in federal
funding for the Big Dig. Aides to other lawmakers said that Kerry
and Representative Jim McGovern, a Worcester Democrat, also lobbied
for the funding, but that House negotiators so far had not agreed
to release the money.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few years, Massachusetts has received about $830
million annually in highway funds, but Congress pared that to about
$525 million annually in a six-year transportation plan approved in
May.

U.N. CAJOLES IRAQ TO COOPERATE ON WEAPONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Security Council called on Iraq on Tuesday
to resume cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors, alluding to
prospects for faster progress on easing economic sanctions against
Baghdad if it heeds the call.
</P>
<P>
   That and several somewhat conciliatory statements by various
members of the 15-member Council followed a periodic review Tuesday
of Iraq's compliance in eliminating its weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Such encouragement was clearly aimed at giving Baghdad some way
of climbing down from a confrontation with the United Nations after
Iraq suspended arms inspections Aug. 5, and as President Saddam
Hussein contemplates his next move.
</P>
<P>
   Talks to resume cooperation failed last week when Baghdad
charged that several Council members, notably the United States and
Britain, were bent on maintaining sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the end of Tuesday's four-hour review, the president
of the Council, Sir Jeremy Greenstock of Britain, said that in the
matter of Baghdad's chemical weapons and missiles, ``there are not
many items still to be resolved if that cooperation is
forthcoming.''
</P>
<P>
   He was preceded by Mohammed Baradei, head of the International
Atomic Energy Agency, who said his Vienna-based organization had
``no indications that Iraq has nuclear weapons, or
nuclear-weapons-usable materials or the capability to produce such
items.''
</P>
<P>
   But Baradei emphasized that the U.N. assessment was ``credible''
but ``not absolute,'' asserting that it depended on the resumption
of Iraq's opening its factories to monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the United States appeared lonely in its
insistence that nothing should change. The U.S. representative to
the Council, Peter Burleigh, said that despite the qualified clean
bill of health given Iraq by the atomic energy agency on nuclear
weapons, the U.S. position on the need for continued intrusive
searches ``has not changed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last week's attempt here to resolve the dispute failed when a
high-level Iraqi delegation headed by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz left after two weeks of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary General Kofi Annan had suggested a compromise solution
by which the United Nations would conduct a ``comprehensive
review'' of Iraq's efforts, which Baghdad favored in the belief
that the review would demonstrate that it had gone a long way
toward eliminating its chemical and nuclear weapons and its
missiles and in return should have some of the sanctions modified
or lifted.
</P>
<P>
   France, China and Russia have expressed considerable sympathy
with that position.
</P>
<P>
   But Iraq remains mired in a dispute over its elimination of
biological weapons, particularly the nerve gas VX, and the question
of whether it has installed the gas on some of its missiles.
</P>
<P>
   That issue will be the subject of another U.N. review set for
Oct. 22 and 23, when France, Switzerland and the United States are
to submit the results of examinations conducted on the missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has asserted that its scientists found
evidence that Iraq loaded the gas onto some of its missiles.
Switzerland said it had found no proof, and France has yet to
deliver the results of the testing of samples that it has examined.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Butler, who heads the U.N. Special Commission, charged
with disarming Iraq, also gave the Council a confidential report.
And a senior U.N. official, Prakash Shah of India, is due in
Baghdad this week to try to resolve the dispute as a special envoy
of Annan.

 &HT;    Have legs gone out of style?
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS, France _ Though plus-size women seem to be as scarce as
hen's teeth in Paris, the women here are being conspicuously stingy
about showing their legs this fall.
</P>
<P>
   All the covered legs on the street are noteworthy because the
prevailing thought has always been _ as long as there's Paris,
miniskirts will never go out of style. With temperatures hovering
in the mid-50s to low 60s, it's hard to tell for certain whether
the pants and long skirts worn are, more often than not, signs of
climate-consciousness or more modest tastes in fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The best of what Parisian designers have to offer for spring and
summer might be showing on the runways around town, but on the
streets, women are firmly rooted in peg-legged pants and skirts
that fall at least to the knee. Grungy girls and grandmothers alike
are wearing heels that add height. Styles on display include
open-toed sandals (with stiff, cuffed jeans), lace-up suede shoes
with 2-inch-thick crepe soles (worn with skirts and thick
leggings), high-heeled ankle boots (worn with the peg-legged pants)
and high-heeled pumps (worn with skirted business suits).

MERRILL LYNCH TO CUT 5 PERCENT OF WORK FORCE

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the first big American financial
firm to announce cutbacks in response to the world's troubled
financial markets, said Tuesday that it would eliminate about 3,400
jobs, or just more than 5 percent of its work force.
</P>
<P>
   Other Wall Street firms, which along with Merrill had swelled
their ranks on the fat profits of the rampant bull market, are
expected to follow suit. Merrill said it expected ``a much more
challenging environment ahead'' for financial companies.
</P>
<P>
   The job cuts, which the firm said would save $500 million a
year, are expected to fall heavily on New York City, where Merrill
said it would dismiss up to 700 of its 10,500 employees. Altogether
in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, the firm said it would lay
off 1,100 employees and 500 full-time consultants and eliminate 400
more jobs through attrition. As many as 800 of the total cuts will
be made through attrition.
</P>
<P>
   But jobs will be lost across the company, Merrill executives
said, with 2,000 coming in the United States and 1,400 coming
overseas. In Europe, for example, the company plans to eliminate
400 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill also said it would fire 900 full-time consultants, who
are mostly involved in technology projects, although David H.
Komansky, Merrill's chairman and chief executive, insisted in an
interview Tuesday that this would not hamper the company's ability
to deal with either Europe's coming introduction of the euro or
computer problems associated with the year 2000. Merrill, like many
financial firms, retains many full-time consultants, particularly
for technology projects, who are not company employees.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill, the nation's largest brokerage firm, also reported a
loss of $164 million, or 49 cents a share, for the three months
that ended on Sept. 30 after taking a $430 million charge, or $288
million after taxes, to pay for the job cuts. Excluding that
charge, Merrill showed a profit of $124 million for the quarter as
earnings were squeezed by the slowdown in underwriting and
securities trading and the fallout from worldwide economic turmoil.
In the third quarter of 1997, a much rosier time for securities
firms, Merrill earned $502 million. This year's third quarter
represented Merrill's first quarterly loss since the fourth quarter
of 1989, when the firm was in the midst of cutting 9,000 people, or
18 percent of its work force, over roughly two years.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani expressed dismay in an interview Tuesday
about the layoffs at Merrill, which he said was the largest
employer in the city. But he was sympathetic about the cutbacks,
saying: ``This is not something they're doing because they want to
do it. This is something they're doing because they have problems
on Wall Street right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The city is better able to withstand a downturn on Wall Street
than it was in the past, the mayor said, adding that he has
expected the downturn for years.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor acknowledged that the layoffs were bad news for
the city's financial and emotional health. ``Wall Street has also a
psychological impact on the city of New York because people who
aren't directly affected by it make decisions about how much
they're going to spend, when they're going to spend it, based on
what's happening on Wall Street,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Merrill Lynch received $28 million in tax incentives
from the city and state in return for agreeing to add 2,000
employees over 15 years to the 9,000 it had at the time. Even after
the current round of layoffs, Merrill will have 9,800 employees in
the city, the company said in a statement, ``and we are fully
confident that our strategy for long-term growth in all of our
businesses will enable us to meet our employment commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill's job cuts and its forecast of tougher times to come
Tuesday cast a shadow over Wall Street, which until July had
enjoyed its most profitable years in living memory. ``Those of us
in the equity business say there but for the grace of God go we,''
said Sallie Krawcheck, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein &AMP; Co., a New
York securities firm. But she added, ``If Merrill is right, there
will be more layoffs and more poor quarters for the industry,''
which is one of New York's biggest employers, and certainly its
richest business.
</P>
<P>
   The job cuts at Merrill, which are expected to fall heavily on
bond specialists, were widely expected after Japan's economic
problems deepened and Russia abrogated its debts in mid-August,
casting a pall over the world's bond and credit markets. The
company in recent weeks would say only that it was ``reviewing the
matter'' of job cuts, but there had been media reports that the
cutbacks would range from more than 1,000 to as many as 3,000 jobs
and would be concentrated in the bond and emerging-markets
divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Along with recently announced job cuts at the new Citigroup _
the combination of Travelers Group and Citicorp _ and others now
being considered at several other financial companies, the cuts at
Merrill are likely to affect the New York economy, particularly
local consumer spending and the real estate market. The cuts at
Citigroup, however, are in part related to the recent merger,
although they also included a significant scaling back of the
riskier bond businesses at Salomon Smith Barney, Citigroup's
investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill's financial results also seemed to disappoint analysts
Tuesday. ``This is clearly not being viewed as a one-quarter
problem,'' said Charles Hill, director of research at First Call, a
research firm in Boston. ``This came in way below expectations for
the quarter, and analysts are cutting their estimates for the
coming year.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Strauss, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., said, ``We
were all expecting the revenues to be weak, but the expenses were
just very high across the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is partly the result of an aggressive expansion policy
the year before the downturn in the securities markets,'' he added,
referring to Merrill's rapid growth in recent months. Nevertheless,
Merrill's stock price rose $1.0625 Tuesday, to $44.9375, but is
still well below its high of nearly $110 in July.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Komansky defended Merrill's rapid expansion of recent years, and
particularly its adventurous acquisitions here and abroad. ``Many
of them were transforming the nature of this firm,'' he said, and
``fit in with our global strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other big brokerage firms _ Paine Webber Group and
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Inc. _ also reported lower earnings
Tuesday as they, too, suffered from the slower securities markets.
At Paine Webber, which has a large nationwide brokerage business,
earnings fell to $82.9 million, or 51 cents a share, from $112.8
million in the quarter a year earlier, just beating a consensus of
analysts' estimates. Donaldson, Lufkin reported earnings of $25.7
million, or 15 cents a share, for the quarter, down almost 80
percent from the quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bond market, credit crash round the world,'' said
Donald Marron, chairman and chief executive of Paine Webber, in an
interview Tuesday about the difficulties in financial markets. His
firm, which has much smaller international and capital markets
businesses than Merrill, is not scaling back, he said, but he
expressed concern that the international economy _ and particularly
Japan and Brazil _ might adversely effect the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Merrill cuts are likely to be followed by other firms in the
coming weeks. ``Notifications started going out today,'' Jonathan
Humphreys, a Merrill spokesman, said Tuesday, showing that the firm
is going ahead rapidly with its layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Komansky said he hoped that there would not be further job cuts
down the road. ``We have tried to rescale the business to suit what
we think the environment will look like,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Merrill employees  &UR; we &LR; re angry that the firm is making such
deep job cuts so soon after it put up $300 million to help rescue
Long-Term Capital Management LP, the hedge fund in Greenwich, Conn.
A deferred compensation plan for Merrill's top executives,
including Komansky, has money invested in the fund. ``I can
understand people who are being downsized and laid off feeling that
kind of thing,'' Komansky said. ``It's something I feel terrible
about. It's not something that's easy, but it's about managing your
cost base to maintain profitability.''
</P>
<P>
   At the World Financial Center in downtown Manhattan, where
Merrill Lynch has its headquarters, employees seemed glum but
resigned about the announcement of job cuts. ``It's just the normal
ups and downs of the market,'' said one worker, who would not give
his name. ``Sometimes these things happen, you know?''

JAPAN'S LOWER HOUSE CLEARS $508 BILLION BANK RESCUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The lower house of the Japanese Parliament passed a bill
Tuesday that would allow the government to inject huge amounts of
money into the nation's weakened banks, moving Japan closer to the
start of repairs on its banking system after months of political
wrangling.
</P>
<P>
   The upper house is expected to approve the legislation on
Friday, the last day of the current session of Parliament. It would
provide a total of 60 trillion yen, or $508 billion, including $144
billion that had already been made available, to rescue banks and
induce them to increase lending and stimulate the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and leaders of other countries have
called for strong action to bolster Japanese banks and to restore
growth in the economy here, the world's second-largest. Japan's
problems have aggravated financial crises elsewhere in Asia, which
have spread throughout much of the developing world. While
officials in Washington are encouraged by the new legislation, they
say it is urgent that Japan follow through and in fact carry out
the program.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest questions is whether the banks will apply for
public funds, even though they need them. Banks appear reluctant to
accept taxpayers' money, particularly if it means they will be
punished for past mistakes or subject to harsh conditions,
including disclosure of financial information they regard as
sensitive. ``The larger issue is whether or not the banks will
actually go along with the deal,'' said James Fiorillo, banking
analyst with ING Baring Securities here. If they do not, he said:
``It could derail the whole package. It could derail the whole
process of saving the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the stock market slid here Tuesday, partly in response
to remarks by Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa indicating that he
was not certain that weak but functioning banks would accept public
funds, or that the government could force them to do so. The chief
cabinet secretary, Hiromu Nonaka, suggested Tuesday morning that
Parliament early next year could consider a proposal to force
troubled banks to accept such funds, and the benchmark Nikkei index
of 225 issues slid 2.3 percent, or 312.33 points, to end trading at
13,242.79.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's banks are precariously capitalized, and to strengthen
their balance sheets they have trimmed their loans to corporations.
Even though interest rates are the lowest in the world, the
reluctance of banks to lend has created a credit squeeze, and
bankruptcies are soaring.
</P>
<P>
   By increasing banks' capital, the government hopes to promote
lending and stimulate the economy, which is in the worst recession
since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's vote came a day after Parliament enacted a law to
nationalize failing banks. The two pieces of legislation amount to
a rescue program knitted together on Monday through intense
negotiations with a fragile coalition of parties in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for the government to buy common or preferred
stock in banks to bring their capital base up to the 8 percent, the
international standard, or to a lower, government standard in the
case of banks that do business only at home. As a condition of
receiving public funds, which could then be lent to credit-starved
businesses, banks would have to disclose the amount of stock they
hold in their portfolios, as well as to make progress reports on
their plans for financial restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Even the stronger banks, which say they easily meet the capital
standards of the Bank for International Settlements, can receive
public money if they agree to acquire a failing bank or if there is
a sharp credit contraction. Banks with insufficient capital will be
forced to scale down their businesses, be shut down, or acquired.
</P>
<P>
   The new legislation would replace a program enacted in February.
That plan provides $254 billion in public funds with few
conditions; it was scrapped because of protests by the Democratic
Party, the main opposition group.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for doubt about whether banks will want to take part
in the latest plan is that few made use of money available under
the previous one. In March, the top 19 banks drew a total of 1.8
trillion yen, or $15 billion, in public funds to increase their
capital, a relatively modest amount, and no other banks have
applied for tax money since then.
</P>
<P>
   Their objection was the same as they are expected to have now:
that the conditions are too stringent. Privately, they also
concede, it is highly embarrassing to accept tax money.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new plan, the banks would be required to apply to a
newly created independent panel, which would impose stiff
requirements, and could require banks that use public money to set
aside part of their profit to absorb losses from loans that become
unrecoverable.
</P>
<P>
   It is also possible that the panel may require bank officers to
take responsibility for mismanagement, though it is not clear
exactly what this might entail.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 60 trillion yen, 25 trillion, or nearly $220 billion,
will be used specifically for increasing the capital of the banking
system. Seventeen trillion yen, or $144 billion, already available
under the current arrangement, will continue to be used to
guarantee depositors' accounts, and the rest would go to the
nationalizing of failing banks.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Monday's passage of the nationalization law, a new
ministerial committee will manage failing banks and help draft
plans to deal with financial turmoil. The Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan, one of the largest and weakest institutions, is expected to
be temporarily nationalized under this plan. The bank could apply
to be put under state control as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   The bank had originally announced plans to merge with Sumitomo
Trust and Banking Corp., but that has fallen through, and it is not
clear whether Long-Term Credit will survive the process of
nationalization and be sold to another institution, or simply be
put out of business.

GUNMEN KILL ISRAELI, PUTTING PEACE DEAL IN DOUBT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Two days before an Israeli-Palestinian summit
meeting near Washington, gunmen believed to be Palestinian
militants shot and killed an Israeli and seriously wounded another
Tuesday as they bathed in a hillside spring outside Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, pressed by hawkish members of
his Cabinet to resist a peace deal, said after the ambush that
there was ``no chance, at this stage, of signing an agreement'' at
the U.S.-sponsored talks scheduled to begin Thursday at Wye
Plantation in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The tough response seemed to be a nod to Netanyahu's rightist
political allies who have threatened to bolt the governing
coalition if he agrees to a further Israeli withdrawal in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But in practice, Netanyahu went ahead with preparations for the
summit meeting, speaking for 40 minutes on the phone with Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright, and announcing plans to go to Jordan
on Wednesday to brief Crown Prince Hassan on the talks. ``There has
been no change in the prime minister's approach to the summit,''
said spokesman David Bar-Illan.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's sharp statement followed a seven-hour Cabinet
meeting in which Ariel Sharon, who formally became foreign minister
Tuesday, reportedly urged his colleagues to limit Netanyahu's room
to maneuver at the Maryland talks.
</P>
<P>
   But Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh said after the meeting that
Netanyahu had won ``a mandate to reach an agreement with the
Palestinians on the condition that they fulfill their commitments
and that Israel's security requirements are satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu has demanded a crackdown on militant groups by the
Palestinian Authority in return for a further Israeli withdrawal
from parts of the West Bank. The United States has proposed an
Israeli pullout from another 13 percent of the West Bank in
exchange for Palestinian steps to combat anti-Israeli violence.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued by his spokesman hours after the slaying,
Netanyahu said that if the attackers had indeed fled to a
Palestinian-controlled area of the West Bank, as reported by the
Israeli police, ``the Palestinian Authority must act immediately to
apprehend them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Netanyahu emphasizes that at the Wye Plantation talks he
will insist on Israel's security demands of the Palestinians,'' the
statement continued. ``Without fulfillment of all the Palestinian
security commitments there will be no agreement, and in light of
this grim reality there is no chance at this stage of signing an
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's attack occurred less than a mile from the West Bank,
at a spring on an isolated hillside southwest of Jerusalem that is
frequented by followers of Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav, a
19th-century Hasidic mystic who lived in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were described by acquaintances as newly religious
Jews in their 20s who had become disciples of Nachman, and who
bathed daily in the spring as a form of ritual purification. The
slain man was identified as Itamar Doron of Ora, a community near
the spring. His friend, Ilan Mazon, from the adjacent community of
Aminadav, was wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always used to pray here, and we got to know them,'' said
Aharon Boimel, who helped renovate the structure housing the
spring. ``After bathing they would dance, and they were always
happy.''

MICROSOFT TAKES ITS CASE TO COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Outlining its strategy for defending its corporate
practices in court, Microsoft Tuesday asserted that it is not a
monopoly, blamed the Netscape Communications Corp. for its own
problems, and offered detailed defenses of its controversial
relationships with America Online, Apple, Intel, Intuit, Netscape
and Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   The defenses came in an unusual 43-page document offered not in
the courtroom but in a paper faxed, e-mailed and hand-delivered to
reporters and posted on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The company's decision to offer a non-legalistic explication of
its position illustrates the importance of public relations to
Microsoft, the defendant in a much-anticipated antitrust trial
scheduled to begin Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to make sure the American public has the ability to
see both sides,'' said Microsoft spokesman Jim Cullinan.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's report will have no impact on the court case. But
Microsoft is fighting in the court of public opinion, as well as
the court of law, because, as a publicly traded company that
markets products under its corporate brand name, the company needs
to be positively viewed by investors and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft issued its document on the same day that federal and
state attorneys prosecuting the company filed the written testimony
of anti-Microsoft witnesses under seal, making them unavailable to
the news media. The government also was to file overnight a list of
exhibits it plans to introduce at trial, but said it would not make
the list public until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, the government urged a judge to reject Microsoft's
request to delay the trial until Nov. 2. The judge strongly
suggested in court last week that he was not inclined to further
postpone the trial, which he had originally hoped to start Sept. 8.
</P>
<P>
   The paper put out Tuesday by Microsoft made no new arguments,
but provided fresh details in its response to a variety of
allegations made by the Justice Department and state officials. The
company provided previously unreported evidence to bolster its case
that it did not bully its competitors in an illegal attempt to
protect a monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   The company also revealed that it has provided the Justice
Department with more than 3.3 million pages of e-mail and other
documents in response to subpoenas. The company accused the
government of sifting through those documents to find a handful of
incriminating quotations and then selectively leaking them, often
out of context, to damage Microsoft in the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department spokeswoman had little to say about the
company's filing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident in our case, and look forward to presenting it
in court,'' said Justice Department spokeswoman Gina Talamona.
</P>
<P>
   The government will attempt to prove that Microsoft has a
monopoly on computer operating systems and has illegally attempted
to extend that monopoly into the market for Internet browsers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Tuesday insisted that it does not have a monopoly,
despite the government's contention that its Windows operating
system is used on 80 percent of all Intel-based personal computers
and installed on 90 percent of all new Intel-based PCs. Microsoft
argued that the market for operating system remains open to
competitors, because ``entry costs are very low and profit
opportunities vast.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft argued that it has not harmed Netscape, but that
``Netscape's own business and strategic failings have contributed
to the decline in usage of Navigator,'' the company's browser.
Microsoft says Netscape's mistakes are legion and have been
conceded by company executives interviewed by newspaper reporters
and book authors.
</P>
<P>
   The government also alleges that Microsoft used its power as a
monopoly to win valuable business supplying the browser used by the
popular on-line service provider America Online. The government
charges that America Online believed Microsoft's browser was
inferior to Netscape's, but chose Microsoft's browser anyway
because Microsoft offered to promote America Online.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Microsoft offered remarks made in 1996 by America
Online chief executive Steve Case, who said ``the more we learned
about the Microsoft technology ... we felt it would allow us to
better meet the needs of our consumer audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Microsoft denied that it did anything untoward in
trying to persuade Intuit to use Microsoft's browser with Intuit's
popular Quicken personal finance program. Microsoft offered
quotations in news articles from Intuit spokeswoman Debra Kelley,
who called Netscape's product ``time-consuming and inconvenient.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft acknowledged that some of its relationships with other
software companies are complex. For example, Microsoft denied
trying to persuade Intel to give up a product called native signal
processing, but acknowledged that it refused to support the Intel
product because of technical issues.
</P>
<P>
   And Microsoft denied trying to persuade Apple to drop its
QuickTime multimedia software, but acknowledged that the companies
had attempted but failed to negotiate one multimedia product that
both companies would support.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Microsoft acknowledged making an altered version of
Sun's Java language, but says it was entitled to do so by its
contract with Sun.

WHAT CRITERIA ARE USED IN AWARDING NOBEL PRIZES?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Most people _ perhaps even most scientists _ had
probably never even heard of a fractional Hall effect before
Tuesday, when the Nobel Prize committee announced that three
scientists were being awarded this year's physics prize for their
detection of the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  And by tomorrow, most people may have forgotten about it
again.
</P>
<P>
   So how did the committee come to make its selection? And, in
these days of increasingly complex and obscure scientific research,
how can anyone judge the ultimate importance of work whose details
are understood by only a few specialists?
</P>
<P>
   Horst Stoermer, one of the new physics laureates, said Tuesday
that as he and his colleagues were carrying out the work that was
to earn them the award, ``if someone had been standing behind me
and said something about Nobel Prizes, I would have laughed.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, he said, ``we had no idea what the implication
was.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, Stoermer said at a press conference at Bell Labs in
New Jersey, which employed him and the other researchers when they
made the discovery in a laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, it seems absurd to him that the prize has elevated
his work to such an elite company, joining the ``legacy of
Einstein'' and other great Nobelists of the past. ``It's an absurd
joke. These people are in an absolutely different category.''
</P>
<P>
   In making the observation of unexpected behavior of a transistor
in an intense magnetic field in an MIT laboratory, he said, ``We
just stumbled onto this.''
</P>
<P>
   But as obscure as the work may seem to the average person,
others say Stoermer is being far too modest. Philip Morrison, a
physicist at MIT, said Tuesday that the discovery by Stoermer and
his colleagues Robert Laughlin and Daniel Tsui ``sure is obscure,
but what it amounts to is the discovery of a phenomenon that is
very widespread.''
</P>
<P>
   What they found, he said, was one example of a
``quasi-particle,'' that is, something that behaves as if it were a
true elementary particle even though in fact it is a large
aggregation of particles.
</P>
<P>
   Such phenomena, Morrison said, are very important in a number of
areas, such as superconducting materials that transmit electricity
with virtually no loss. ``I do think that's quite important,'' he
said. `'It's not as fundamental, not as widespread as something
that deals with light or gravity,'' but it actually may have more
direct and practical applications than such large-scale theoretical
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've learned something basic'' about kinds of matter that
affect our everyday lives, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Anderson, a physicist and emeritus professor at Princeton
University, and himself a Nobel Laureate in 1977, said that the new
work provides new insights into quantum theory, and ``the world
runs by quantum theory, and unless you really understand how
quantum theory works, you're not going to understand how the world
works.''
</P>
<P>
   The effect the three physicists observed, in which electrons in
a transistor appeared to exhibit electrical charges that were only
one-third of what they should have been, happened in very unusual
conditions: a temperature of almost absolute zero, and the
strongest magnetic field ever produced on Earth at that time, one
million times as strong as the Earth's. Nevertheless, Anderson
said, if matter can behave that way in these conditions, ``it gives
us the freedom to think that it might do that somewhere else in the
universe.... It's an entirely new possibility, and real novelty is
not that common.''
</P>
<P>
   While it's easy to look back at the Nobel laureates from decades
ago and see clearly how important their work was, it can be
difficult to assess the significance of recent work, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can look back at things that looked unimpressive or obscure
at the time,'' he said. ``Nowadays, there are whole scientific
societies based on these things that seemed fairly irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   His own early work on magnetic domain theory, he said, was
something ``we were doing for pure curiosity.'' But, in ways that
he could never have foreseen, some of that work helped to form the
basis for magnetic recording in everything from videocasettes to
computer disk drives. ``The ideas ended up being multibillion
dollar industries.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; But not all great discoveries that ended up having important
applications have garnered Nobel prizes for their discoverers, said
Laughlin, one of Tuesday's new laureates and a physics professor at
Stanford University. Bell Laboratories, originally a division of
AT&AMP;T and now, since that company's divestiture, an arm of Lucent
Technologies, is highly unusual in sponsoring the kind of pure
scientific research that has earned its scientists more Nobels than
all but a handful of nations.
</P>
<P>
   Most industrial research, Laughlin said, is conducted under
total secrecy so that the sponsoring company can benefit from
exclusive use of any inventions that result. Thus, while the Bell
Labs invention of the transistor was public _ and earned a Nobel _
the followup discovery of the Metal-Oxide Semiconductor
Field-Effect transistor, or MOSFET, was done in secret by Fairchild
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   That was the invention that ``was really worthy'' of a prize,
Laughlin said. Yet ``nobody can say off the top of their head who
invented it,'' and there are no detailed reports of the discovery
in the scientific literature.
</P>
<P>
   Laughlin disputed claims that his group's work might lead to
practical applications. ``I say no,'' he said. ``The things that I
know that are of technical value are all secret.''
</P>
<P>
   While a few worthy scientists have been overlooked by the Nobel
Committee over the years, Anderson said, on the whole they have
done a remarkably good job of honoring the right people _ at least
in the areas of physics and chemistry. ``I'm not talking about
Literature or Peace,'' he said, ``but in physics, there are very
few that you could point to and say those were a real mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Brecher, professor of physics and astronomy at Boston
University, said that in the early days of this century, there may
have been a few such cases: Nobel prizes in physics were granted to
the inventors of the automated lighthouse and of color photography.
While both were certainly worthy inventions that had an impact on
society, they are not generally thought of these days as landmarks
of physics.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, Stoermer shouldn't feel bad about not being in
the same league as past laureates like Einstein. ``Who else can be
Einstein? Nobody's going to slam you for that.''

CLINTON DEMANDS YUGOSLAV COMPLIANCE WITH KOSOVO ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KOSOVO-ACCORD, KOSOVO-ASSESS) 
(sw) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Tuesday demanded serious
progress toward compliance with the Kosovo accord from Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic within the next four days to avoid air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, senior American officials insisted that they had used
NATO successfully to avert a human disaster, do justice to the
ethnic Albanians of Kosovo and increase their ability to control
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while the details of the agreements reached by Milosevic
and the American special envoy Richard Holbrooke were kept vague,
there were serious doubts expressed that the Clinton administration
had pushed Milosevic hard enough on the issue of real autonomy for
Kosovo to create a durable settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Morton Abramowitz, a former State Department official deeply
involved in the Kosovo issue, said: ``The durability of the
agreements depends on what the Kosovo Albanians got politically
after seven months of destruction. If they got less than the
pre-1989 autonomy they had and the administration promised, then
I'm afraid we're in for long-term trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in comments on Tuesday morning, said: ``We will not
rely on what President Milosevic says, but what he does for the
whole world to see,'' through the agreement to put 2,000 unarmed,
civilian observers in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Their task, while NATO aircraft fly overhead, is to verify
Yugoslav compliance with a U.N. resolution calling for Milosevic to
reduce the number of troops and special police in Kosovo and
confine them to barracks, to allow aid to reach up to 300,000
refugees and to hold serious talks with the ethnic Albanian
majority in Kosovo for a political settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said that
NATO would insist that Milosevic make ``serious progress'' toward
complying with all his commitments before NATO's 96-hour ultimatum
expires. Otherwise, he said, NATO would proceed to bomb Yugoslav
army and police positions in Kosovo. ``The ultimate enforcer here
is NATO air power,'' Berger said, while Clinton praised NATO and
its willingness to use force as a key factor in pushing Milosevic
toward agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, in an interview from his airplane returning to the
United States, said that Milosevic's agreement to let 2,000
foreigners under the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe verify his compliance in Kosovo while NATO does so in the
air were breakthroughs, given Milosevic's previous refusal to let
foreigners into Kosovo or the OSCE work there.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have all those people on the ground is very important to
the ethnic Albanians,'' Holbrooke said. He noted that their elected
leader, Ibrahim Rugova, ``said he wanted the largest possible
number of foreigners on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   More details of the agreement emerged on Tuesday _ including a
commitment from Milosevic to finish the details of the verification
procedures by next Monday, to complete ``the main elements'' of a
political autonomy agreement with the ethnic Albanians by Nov. 2
and to hold free elections in the province within nine months.
</P>
<P>
   James Rubin, the State Department spokesman, emphasized that
Milosevic had made concessions toward local control of police and
village and provincial government in Kosovo that ``will vastly
improve the lives of many people.'' If the American mediation
works, by Nov. 2, Milosevic will have agreed ``to more autonomy for
Kosovo than he has for the last 10 years,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts of the region raised questions, based on what has
been made public, about how much autonomy the Kosovars will
actually get.
</P>
<P>
   Ivo Daalder of the Brookings Institution, a former National
Security Council official dealing with Bosnia, said the West ``is
pretty much kicking the can down the road in Kosovo,'' solving the
immediate human crisis but not resolving the fundamental issue of
Kosovo's status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic's unilateral offer falls short of the U.S. proposal,
which itself falls short of anything any self-respecting Kosovo
politician, let alone a Kosovar with a gun, is willing to accept,''
Daalder said.
</P>
<P>
   But Holbrooke said that Milosevic's position was a starting
point and that the Americans have not tried to impose a political
solution on the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an emergency inside a crisis,'' Holbrooke said. ``As
for the emergency _ the military confrontation that brought us to
the brink of NATO action _ we can see the path to its resolution,
if Milosevic doesn't backslide. But the crisis is Kosovo, and there
has been no change in the political issues that caused the tragedy,
the rampaging and the pillaging this summer.''

TYSON SEEMED MENTALLY FIT TO RETURN TO THE RING  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By TIMOTHY W. SMITH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A series of psychological evaluations of Mike Tyson conducted
two weeks ago at Massachusetts General Hospital reports that the
former heavyweight boxing champion suffers from depression, anger,
low self-esteem, irritability, and that he has trouble controlling
his impulses. But it also concludes that he is mentally fit to
return to the ring.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said that Tyson should have ``weekly, if not
more frequent, psychotherapy sessions'' to help deal with his
emotional problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the opinion of the evaluation team that Mr. Tyson is
mentally fit to return to boxing, to comply with the rules and
regulations, and to do so without repetition of the events of June
28, 1997,'' Dr. Ronald Schouten, the director of Law and Psychiatry
Service at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, wrote in the
report to the Nevada State Athletic Commission. ``While we take
note of the impulsivity, emotional problems, and cognitive problems
outlined above, it is our opinion that none of these, alone or in
combination, render Mr. Tyson mentally unfit in this regard.''
</P>
<P>
   Schouten's mention of the events of June 28, 1997 was a
reference to the title bout between Tyson and Evander Holyfield,
when Tyson bit his opponent's ears and was disqualified. Shortly
afterward, the Nevada commission revoked his license and fined him
$3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Following a hearing to regain his license on Sept. 19, the
commission asked Tyson to undergo psychological testing before it
agreed to take up his application again. Tyson and his lawyers
fought to have the psychological evaluation kept private, but the
commission said it had to release the report under the state's open
records law. Last Friday, the Nevada State Supreme Court ruled
against Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing the risk of embarrassment from the public disclosure of
his private psychological tests against his need to regain his
boxing license, Tyson signed a waiver to release the report and
turned it over to the commission, which released it Tuesday
morning. The boxer will appear for a public hearing in Las Vegas,
Nev., on Oct. 19 to answer any questions the five members of the
commission have for him.
</P>
<P>
   The questions are expected to include many about a traffic
accident in Gaithersburg, Md., in August in which Tyson is alleged
to have punched one man and kicked another in the groin. The two
men have filed criminal assault charges against Tyson and the case
is scheduled for trial on the same day that Tyson will appear
before the Nevada commission. On the advice of his lawyer, Tyson
would not answer questions about the incident during his last
hearing. But he is expected to address the matter at the next one.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which includes the evaluations of six different
doctors who conducted a battery of neurological and psychological
tests over a five-day period from Sept. 21-26, reveals sensitive
personal information on Tyson's life history, and his behavior. It
is the kind of information that would never be revealed publicly,
because it would fall under doctor-patient confidentiality rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've read the report, you know why we fought so hard to
keep it from being released to the public,'' said James Jimmerson,
Tyson's Las Vegas- based lawyer. ``It's kind of a moot point now,
but he certainly wasn't desirous of this type of information being
made public. He wasn't concerned about himself. He was more
concerned that his children would have to go to school and be
subjected to comments about information in the report.''
</P>
<P>
   The report states that Tyson, 32, had been prescribed Zoloft, an
anti-depressant, for the past month, but the drug had no benefit or
side-effects for him. It also says that Tyson was embarrassed,
angry and felt humiliated about having to undergo the evaluations,
because he thought everyone would think he was ``a psycho.'' But
all the psychologists involved said that Tyson willingly cooperated
with the testing.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson got angry with one of his evaluators, Dr. Thomas Deter, on
one occasion when Deter asked him about taking a test that required
reading.
</P>
<P>
   ``He became much less engaged in the interview, and at one point
he expressed deep feelings of anger directed at me and the
evaluation process,'' Deter wrote in his report. ``He quickly
assured me that he had no intention to act on these feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Deter's summary said that it would have been helpful in making
the evaluation if he had had access to Tyson's school and prison
records ``which document learning or behavioral problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Deter found that Tyson demonstrated ``executive control
deficits. Individuals with this neurobehavioral profile often have
difficulties with impulse control, inhibition of behavior,
judgment, and rapid decision making. If his mood can be adequately
managed, he will likely have better control over these
neurobehavioral deficits. With deterioration in his mood, he is
likely to be more susceptible to acting on impulse and showing poor
judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Deter said he could not predict whether Tyson ``will lose
control of his behavior in a future boxing match. He exhibits
neurobehavioral and emotional deficits that make him susceptible to
this, but are by no means predictive of it.'' Deter recommended
that Tyson continue psychotherapy sessions weekly, if not more
frequently, to handle his emotional problems.
</P>
<P>
   A psychological test conducted by Dr. David Medoff found that
Tyson does not have ``the presence of any major mental illness or
personality disorder.'' The evaluation also found that Tyson is
``angry and irritable and that he is cautious, and even suspicious,
of others' motives at times. As is the case with most people, there
will be instances in which he becomes increasingly angry and
frustrated, and the potential for the direct expression of this
anger, and lapses in self-control, may occur. There will also be
circumstances in which Mr. Tyson will be fully able to manage his
emotions without acting upon them.''

SPY AGENCIES' EX-ANALYST CHARGED WITH SELLING SECRETS TO SOVIETS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A former code-breaking analyst at the top-secret
National Security Agency was charged Tuesday with spying for Moscow
for the last three years of the Soviet Union's existence.
</P>
<P>
   David Sheldon Boone, a 46-year-old former enlisted man who
worked for both Army intelligence and the NSA during his 21-year
Army career, was arrested by FBI agents on Saturday at an airport
hotel outside Washington, and made an initial appearance Tuesday in
federal District Court in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The government charged that from 1988 until 1991, Boone passed
top secret documents to a KGB officer he knew as ``Igor,''
revealing, among other things, what the United States knew about
the capabilities of Soviet tactical nuclear weapons. In return, he
was paid more than $60,000 by the KGB, the government said.
</P>
<P>
   Boone was arrested after he was lured back to the United States
from Germany by FBI agents posing as Russian spies. Through an
intermediary who met Boone in London, the FBI had convinced him
that Moscow wanted him to resume his espionage career. Boone fell
for the FBI's favorite method of trapping inactive Cold War spies
who now find themselves on the wrong side of history, the
government said. Since the Soviet collapse in 1991, most FBI
investigations of Moscow's old spies have been prompted by leads
provided by Russian defectors or informants in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   That information is almost never enough to make an arrest, so
the bureau often sets up a sting in which agents pose as Russians
renewing old contacts. They then get the suspect to explain exactly
what he did for Moscow in the old days.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit said Boone, a native of Flint, Mich., joined the
Army in 1970, and was trained in code-breaking and so-called
``signals intelligence,'' which means eavesdropping on enemy
communications and then analyzing the data. He worked in an Army
intelligence station in Augsburg, Germany, as well as at NSA
headquarters at Fort Meade, Md.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1988, the affidavit said, after 18 years in a series of
highly sensitive posts in the Army, Boone's life began to unravel.
His marriage broke up and his wife gained custody of their
children, while he became mired in debt and increasingly angry that
so much of his Army pay was going to his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Just before his transfer from NSA headquarters back to Augsburg
in 1988, Boone walked into the Soviet Embassy in Washington, showed
officials there his Fort Meade and Army photo badges, and turned
over a classified document in return for $300, the government
affidavit said.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, he began meeting four times a year with his KGB
handler, ``Igor.'' He handed over secrets at bargain basement
prices, including one document he later described to the FBI as
revealing ``the targeting of U.S. nuclear weapons against Soviet
targets.'' He received just $5,000 to $7,000 from Igor at each
meeting, according to the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   But a 1990 security investigation had disclosed to the Army his
new relationship with a German woman and his mounting debts, the
affidavit said. His job evaluations had declined, and so his access
to classified information was suspended.
</P>
<P>
   He retired from the Army the next year, just as the Soviet Union
was collapsing. Moscow seemed to lose interest in Boone. When the
FBI caught up with him, he was remarried and living in Germany,
where he had been working at a succession of computer-related jobs.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Masters of the Universe are quaking, not over the
latest initial public offering or a merger gone bad, but over pink
slips. After months of financial turmoil and weeks of frightening
rumors, some of New York's money mavens are finally losing their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Investment giant Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. said yesterday that it will
slash 3,400 jobs, or about 5 percent of its work force, and
industry observers say that is just the beginning of the trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merrill's opened the floodgate. They're making it that much
easier for other firms to announce layoffs,'' said Edward S.
Orchant, president of A-L Associates, a veteran Wall Street
headhunter.
</P>
<P>
   Orchant said that, unless conditions improve quickly, between
30,000 and 60,000 brokers, bankers and traders will be out of work
by the end of the year. That may not seem like a deep cutback to
most people. But for an industry that employes only a few hundred
thousand worldwide, it is substantial, and for a financial capital
like New York, potentially disasterous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're about to feel the brunt of the downturn,'' said H. Carl
McCall, the New York State comptroller whose responsibilities
include monitoring the city's financial health.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's sustained, that is serious for New York,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the first ripples of the stock market turmoil and the
layoffs are already being felt in that most sensitive quarter of
the New York economy _ residential real estate. Apartment prices,
which had been rising at a 15-percent annual clip largely on the
backs of ballooning Wall Street pay packages, have suddenly
stalled, according to industry executives. And owners, especially
of high-end units _ those selling for $1 million or more _ have
actually begun cutting their asking prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days of the over-bid are gone,'' said Barbara Corcoran,
chairman of the Corcoran Group, one of the city's largest real
estate companies.
</P>
<P>
   The financial industry's current troubles sprang up
spectacularly fast. As late as mid-August, the industry, which
includes securities firms, investment houses and commercial banks,
was on its way to a third consecutive year of record revenues,
according to Rae Rosen, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York.
</P>
<P>
   But the spread of the Asian crisis to Russia, Russia's abrupt
decision to stop payment on some foreign debt and subsequent
turmoil in Brazil frightened millions of investors and sent
financial markets spiraling off in unexpected directions.
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil took its biggest toll on hedge funds like Long-Lerm
Capital Management LP, a private investment group of wealthy
individuals and institutions that nearly collapsed last month when
its multibillion dollar bets on where markets were headed went
sour.
</P>
<P>
   But the trouble also caused some of the financial industry's
most lucrative lines of business to dry up. Corporate mergers,
which can fetch firms like Merrill handsome fees, went from a pace
of 40-to-50 combinations a month to three or four, according to
Securities Data Corp. Stock and bond underwriting dropped by one
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went from running on all 14 cylinders to park,'' said
Richard Peterson, a Securities Data executive.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of the damage began to show itself yesterday when
Merrill and two other investment firms, Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette Inc. and Paine Webber Group, announced hefty drops in
their quarterly profit.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill, the nation's biggest securities firm as measured by
capital, posted a $164 million loss, its first since 1989, after
taking a $288 million charge to cover the cost of layofffs. DLJ,
the nation's eighth largest investment bank, said that its profits
dropped almost 80 percent from $120.3 million a year ago to $25.7
million. Paine Webber posted a more modest 27-percent profit
decline frm $112.8 million to $82.9 million. Analysts expect a
steady stream of disappointing profit announcements from other
finacial firms in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, almost everybody involved in the financial industry
knew that the good times had already lasted beyond most people's
expectations and could not go on forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have to be an idiot to work in this business and not
know it's cyclical,'' said Roy C. Smith, a former partner with
Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, industry observers said that Merrill's cutbacks
were not as wholesale as they might have been. ``They are not
exiting any businesses'' and therefore dropping entire divisions of
employes, said Orchant.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said that financial executives are almost certainly
in for more bad news. They said that several firms that have yet to
announce their quarterly profits, especially Citigroup's Salomon,
Smith Barney and Bankers Trust, are likely to make deeper cuts than
Merrill.
</P>
<P>
   And when that happens, they warned, the effects are likely to be
felt well beyond the financial industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a general sense of well-being that all New York City
gets from a healthy stock market,'' said Corcoran. ``Right now,
with the battering the markets are taking, New Yorkers are feeling
that things are not as good as they were. It's a clear mood
change,'' she said.

CENSUS PROCEDURE A STICKING POINT IN BUDGET TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A sticking point for White House and congressional
budget negotiators has been the issue of how the 2000 census will
be conducted, and the White House is finding itself negotiating on
the issue as much with House Democrats as it is with the House
Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, White House negotiators, led by chief of staff
Erskine Bowles, tried to determine whether Democrats would accept a
deal to finance for six months the departments of State, Justice
and Commerce, which oversees the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would put off until next March the contentious issue of
whether the next census would use statistical sampling to
supplement traditional methods of counting people.
</P>
<P>
   Bowles told the group of Democrats that the House Republicans
were willing to give on a number of outstanding issues that were
stalling final agreement on the budget, but that they were digging
in their heels when it came to financing the census for six months.
The Democrats met in the office of Minority Leader Dick Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   The rationale for the half-year financing is that by next March
the Supreme Court is expected to rule on whether using sampling is
legal or constitutional. The Supreme Court has already agreed to
review two lower court rulings that said sampling would violate
federal law. Oral arguments on the cases are set for November.
</P>
<P>
   But House Democrats balked at the idea of six months' financing
for the census, arguing that even if the Supreme Court allowed
sampling, the Republicans would be under no obligation to approve
money for a census that included sampling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general feeling among many Democrats was that even if we
won the case, there would be a lot less leverage in March,
especially if it was the only issue left to be debated,'' said a
House Democratic official who insisted on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats contend that now is the time to press the Republicans,
while they want to complete work on the budget and go home to
campaign.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., who attended the meeting
Monday, said, ``It was, sort of, this is where we are. We've been
able to accomplish great things, what do you think? We made it very
clear that unless the census was included, along with some other
issues, like school construction, the deal wouldn't be
acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistical sampling would allow the Census Bureau to estimate
populations that are difficult to count, and would have the largest
effect on the counting of African-Americans in cities and blacks
and Hispanics in rural areas, groups that are traditionally
undercounted by the standard means.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans fear, and Democrats hope, that the method would
raise the count of people living in traditionally Democratic areas,
giving the party an advantage when new boundaries for election
districts are drawn following the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   At Monday's meeting, the Democrats reminded administration
officials that Clinton had promised that he would veto any
legislation that restricted the Census Bureau's ability to conduct
an accurate census.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of any way that restricts the census more than
not to fully fund it,'' said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The willingness of House Democrats, including Gephardt, to press
the president on the issue represents a realization of their
leverage with Clinton, who will need all of their support in the
coming impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gephardt is a major player now, and the irony is we helped
make him that,'' said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., who supports
the use of sampling in the census.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' position also indicates how little trust many
have in the White House on this issue. The proposal to finance the
departments of Commerce, Justice and State for six months is
similar to one reached last November between Bowles and House
Speaker Newt Gingrich. The idea then was that holding all three
departments hostage in the census fight would place maximum
pressure on all sides to work out their differences over sampling.
</P>
<P>
   But House Democrats were not consulted before that agreement was
struck and later grumbled about it. At a meeting of the Democratic
caucus Tuesday, Ms. Maloney briefed lawmakers on dealings with the
White House and declared that Clinton had promised that he would
hold firm on the census and that she believed him, a participant
said. The statement was greeted with laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain level of suspicion because there have been
times when we have been cut out,''said the House Democratic
official. ``But I have to say, there hasn't been much evidence of
that, this time.''

FIREWORKS EXPLOSION IN MEXICO KILLS AT LEAST 10, INJURES 100 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ANDREW DOWNIE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ An explosion ripped through a small town known as
the capital of Mexico's fireworks industry on Tuesday, killing at
least 10 people and injuring as many as 100.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that the blast in Tultepec, a small town about 30
miles north of Mexico City, was caused by a natural gas leak, which
in turn ignited gunpowder used to make fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion, which occurred at about 9:30 a.m., destroyed at
least nine buildings in a three-block area of the town. Dozens of
other buildings were damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The blast ripped roofs off houses, tore doors from their hinges
and shattered windows. People three miles away heard the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Cesar Camacho Quiroz, the governor of the state of Mexico where
Tultepec is located, said 10 people died in the explosion and 23
were injured. Some reports, however, put the death toll as high as
16. The Mexican Red Cross estimated that at least 100 people were
injured.
</P>
<P>
   A Red Cross official warned that the death toll could rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be more dead, because they are talking about 15
missing,'' said Alejandro Gomez, head of the Red Cross' emergency
response section.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people desperately dug through the rubble searching
for survivors. By early evening, police had brought in dogs and
heavy equipment to aid the search effort.
</P>
<P>
   Tultepec is famous for its fireworks, both those made in legal
factories and those made clandestinely in homes. About 85 percent
of the town's residents make a living from manufacturing or selling
the devices. Last year, three people were killed in the town after
an explosion in a home.
</P>
<P>
   For hours after the blast, angry residents formed a human
barricade to keep journalists away from the explosion site. Many
people denied that gunpowder played a role in the accident and
attributed the explosion to a gas leak.
</P>
<P>
   ``An explosion of this magnitude is not caused by this type of
gunpowder,'' said Sofia Montes, who works in a family fireworks
factory in Tultepec. ``Explosions of fireworks smell of sulfur.
This was very different. It was like a mushroom cloud.''
</P>
<P>
   Felipe Santos, head of disaster operations for the state of
Mexico, and other officials said, however, that the explosion was
caused by a combination of gunpowder and natural gas. Police said
the area smelled strongly of gunpowder and gas for hours after the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Montes and other residents said authorities enforce strict
regulations on the production of fireworks, restricting the
manufacture of the devices to two areas of town.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Camacho said he would not speculate on the cause of
Tuesday's explosion until investigators complete their inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is premature to say what happened or what the cause was,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the people killed Tuesday were decapitated by the force
of the explosion. A 10-year-old boy was among the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Although laws have been enacted to regulate the sale of
fireworks in Mexico, few are enforced, critics say. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, 62 people in Mexico City died after fireworks exploded
at a market.
</P>
<P>
   Gas leaks have also caused tragedies in Mexico. In 1992, an
explosion that followed the leak of gasoline into a sewer system
killed at least 200 people in Guadalajara and injured hundreds of
others.
</P>
<P>

EDUCATION BECOMES KEY ISSUE IN BUDGET TALKS
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON _ Struggling to meet their fourth deadline over the
federal budget, congressional Republicans and White House officials
wrestled Tuesday with their differences over education, staging
events to demonstrate support for what has become the most public
and politically high-stakes element of the budget battle.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators met into the night to hash out their disagreements
over aid for schools, the census and contraceptives. These were
among the biggest issues that still separated the two sides as each
tried to formulate a message to take home to voters for the Nov. 3
elections.
</P>
<P>
   On education, the issue that President Clinton has propelled to
the forefront of the talks and on which Republicans do not want to
appear recalcitrant, both sides have agreed to spend more than $1
billion but disagree over how to spend it. The president insists
the money be spent on hiring 100,000 teachers across the country so
that the average class can be reduced to 18 students. Republicans,
railing against ``Beltway bureaucrats,'' say that local school
districts should decide how the money is spent, whether it be for
teachers or computers.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides remained apart on several ideological matters,
including whether to allow federal health plans to cover
contraceptives and whether to allow those few plans with religious
affiliations to refuse to cover contraceptives not only on
religious grounds but on moral grounds as well.
</P>
<P>
   And they also were split on how to conduct the census in the
year 2000. This is one of the thorniest issues. It is not one that
moves voters, but it is vital to both parties because it helps
determine their relative strength in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Erskine Bowles, the president's
chief of staff and top negotiator, met for much of the day in the
speaker's office, shuttling in and out of ante-rooms with their
lieutenants but giving few clues about the nitty gritty details of
their talks.
</P>
<P>
   They have given themselves another deadline of midnight
Wednesday to wrap up about $500 billion-worth of spending items,
but they could easily extend that deadline another day or two. They
missed the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year, providing temporary
funding for the federal government through Oct. 9, then Oct. 12,
then Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the other central issues, such as financing for the
International Monetary Fund, were all but nailed down, but neither
side was ready to declare a final deal until all the other elements
of the budget package are in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're down to splitting infinitives,'' Rep. Dick Armey of
Texas, the Republican majority leader, said of approving funds for
the international fund.
</P>
<P>
   As they worked through several issues, Republican leaders
appeared to be calculating the differences in their own party that
might sour a final deal when it arrives on the House floor _ more
of a concern than on the Senate floor because the Senate has fewer
differences among its Republicans and with the White House.

MONSANTO, AMERICAN HOME PRODUCTS SCRAP MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., N.J.)  (mk) 
 By DAVID MORROW and BARNABY FEDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ American Home Products Corp. and Monsanto Co.
scrapped their $34.4 billion merger Tuesday, the third big
combination in the pharmaceutical industry to fail this year.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement, the companies said the deal had been
abandoned because it was not in the best interests of their
shareholders. Yet, people close to the deal said Tuesday that the
merger was terminated because of an insurmountable power struggle
between the two companies' chairmen, John Stafford at American Home
Products and Robert Shapiro at Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   While a clash between the chief executives of merging companies
is common, analysts said Tuesday that they were becoming
increasingly concerned that these disputes were upending deals that
could have benefited shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   All three of the drug industry's giant mergers this year have
failed _ first between American Home Products and SmithKline
Beecham in January and one month later between SmithKline Beecham
and Glaxo Wellcome _ largely because one of the chief executives
refused to yield power or compensation to a former rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been mergers that have been scuttled because of
people issues,'' said Viren Mehta, a partner at Mehta Partners, a
biopharmaceutical investment firm. ``This appears to be one of
them. The boards have a fiduciary duty to make sure that any
individual needs don't get in the way of the needs that drive
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The botched deal was also painful to Wall Street, which has been
hit by sharp downturns in the financial markets in the past two
months. With investment banks slicing their payrolls _ Merrill
Lynch &AMP; Co. announced a huge cutback Tuesday _ the industry cannot
afford to lose the fees a deal of this size would have generated.
Analysts estimated Tuesday that Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., which advised
Monsanto, and Bear Stearns &AMP; Co., which advised American Home
Products, forfeited $50 million in fees between them.
</P>
<P>
   Investors also fled. American Home Products' stock drooped only
slightly in midmorning trading, but then fell $5, or 10 percent, to
close at $45. Shares of Monsanto, the smaller company, plunged
$13.375, or 26.6 percent, to $37.
</P>
<P>
   The issues that sank the merger appeared to have been simmering
since the deal was announced in June. At that time, the headlines
could not have been brighter. The merger, the largest ever in the
pharmaceutical industry and the sixth largest among U.S.
corporations, would have created the nation's largest seller of
prescription drugs and the world's largest agricultural company.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from such name brands as Advil painkiller, Centrum
vitamins and Nutrasweet sugar substitute, American Home Products
and Monsanto would have been one of the world's leading life
sciences companies. Using biotechnology, it could not only develop
new agricultural products but drugs and foods with specially
engineered ingredients known as nutraceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   While the merger appeared promising on paper, none of the
bankers calculated the effect the structure of the deal would have
on its outcome, or adequately gauged the disparate personalities of
the combined company's chairmen.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies described the deal as a merger of equals, but
American Home Products was, in effect, purchasing Monsanto. Under
the terms, American Home Products was to swap 1.15 of its shares
for each Monsanto share, giving it 65 percent control of the new
company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro and Stafford said they would run the company jointly, an
arrangement that raised skepticism in Europe and in the United
States. Six months earlier, Stafford had refused to yield power to
Jan Leschly, SmithKline Beecham's chief executive, a point that
ultimately sank that merger.
</P>
<P>
   Though both are lawyers, Stafford had little in common with
Shapiro. Shapiro, 60, worked his way through Searle before Monsanto
bought it in 1985 but refused to move to Monsanto's headquarters
city of St. Louis from his home in Chicago when he became chairman
of the company. Instead, he has kept in touch with Monsanto
executives largely through e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Stafford, who is also 60, a constant presence at
American Home Products headquarters in Madison, N.J., he sometimes
goes to the company gym at his lunch hour to play pickup basketball
games. There, some colleagues say, he is not above using his elbows
to get a better position.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble between the two chiefs began in the summer. Analysts
said Stafford became concerned about Shapiro's role in the proposed
company and his anticipated level of compensation. Even though
Stafford drew a higher salary at American Home Products than
Shapiro at Monsanto, he made considerably less after stock options
were included.
</P>
<P>
   Stafford was also said to become increasingly annoyed when
Shapiro made decisions without consulting him. According to one
source familiar with Monsanto, Stafford was angry that Shapiro had
named Gary Crittenden as Monsanto's chief financial officer in
August. Stafford was so irritated that he circulated an internal
memo that assured his staff Crittenden would not hold an important
role in the merged company.
</P>
<P>
   An American Home Products spokesman declined to comment about
the memo.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between the two intensified in recent weeks,
analysts said, when Shapiro insisted he serve as co-chairman as
originally planned. But Stafford refused, noting American Home
Products had controlling interest of the combined company, not the
other way around.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for American Home Products denied that the struggle
between the two chief executives had anything to do with the merger
falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro repeatedly declined to discuss why the merger had
collapsed, but said finally, ``It had a `Rashomon' quality,''
referring to the classic movie by Akira Kurosawa in which viewers
see four accounts of a rape and murder with no hint of which is
correct. ``Everyone will have different views of what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With this merger out of the way, other companies may attempt a
deal, probably with Monsanto. Novartis, the Swiss-based company
formed by the merger two years ago of Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz, has
long been rumored to be interested in Monsanto. Daniel Vasella, the
president of Novartis, said Tuesday through a company spokesman
that it would be inappropriate to comment.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products and Monsanto are both likely to try other
mergers, analysts said, though not before next year. American Home
has recently released a bevy of new products, which could
significantly lift the company's sales.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto appears to have the brighter future, at least in the
short term. The company said Tuesday that it had arranged to add $2
billion to its revolving credit agreement with Citibank and that it
would issue new equity as soon as conditions in the stock market
improve. Monsanto did not say how much equity it would like to
issue but it will ask the Securities and Exchange Commission for
pre-approval covering the sale of as much as $6 billion in shares
and debt.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto will not be able to raise enough cash from investors,
though, to sustain growth at G.D. Searle, its drug subsidiary. ``We
will be back in the partnering business,'' said Shapiro, who long
ago conceded that Searle was too small to adequately finance
research and the introduction of new products on its own. Searle is
marketing its most promising new product, an anti-arthritic drug
called Celebra, in a venture with Pfizer Inc. that was announced
before the deal with American Home Products.
</P>
<P>
   The nutraceutical business is also expected to rely more on
partnerships to take advantage of Monsanto's technology. It is not
yet clear whether the end products will be mostly consumer goods
like vitamins, in which case the distribution skills of American
Home Products would have been invaluable, or food ingredients, an
area where Monsanto has more experience.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto's agricultural business is likely to be the least
affected by the collapse of the merger. Though American Home
Products, with more than $2 billion in annual pesticide sales, is
one of the largest crop protection companies, its major products
are among those that have been losing ground to Monsanto's Roundup,
the world's best-selling herbicide. And it is American Home that
needed Monsanto, not vice versa, to gain expertise in applying
biotechnology to crops and livestock.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro also stressed that Monsanto remains committed to its
goal of building a life sciences company.
</P>
<P>
   The vision is the same even though the opportunity to move years
ahead in one fell swoop has been lost, Shapiro said. ``We just have
to get the capabilities another way.''

SEA LAUNCH WON'T BLAST OFF UNTIL MARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The first blastoff of the Sea Launch rocket has
slipped to March 1999, and the payload will be a dummy satellite,
Boeing said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stories had been swirling for weeks from Boeing's Sea Launch
partners that the satellite would be replaced by a dummy because of
failures of the RussianZenit rocket. PanAmSat Corp. of Greenwich,
Conn., confirmed the rumors Monday by announcing that its Galaxy XI
satellite would be orbited by the French Ariane rocket instead of
Sea Launch, as it had planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ariane 4 vehiclewill enable us to reduce potential risk
and ensure the timely launch,'' said Frederick Landman, PanAmSat's
president.
</P>
<P>
   But PanAmSat did not give up on Sea Launch. ``PanAmSat intends
to launh a future satellite on the Sea Launch vehicle during the
fourth quarter of 1999,'' the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Dolan, spokesman for Boeing Space Communications, said the
the fourth-quarter 1999 shot is an extra one. Sea Launch still has
orders for 18 shots through 2004, including 13 launches for Hughes
Space &AMP; Communications International Inc. and five from Loral Space
&AMP; Communications Ltd. Analysts estimate each launch will bring in
about $50 million, about one-tenth of 1 percent of Boeing's annual
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The rocket to be launched in March will be a three-stage Zenit
vehicle in a configuration never before used. The two lower stages
are Russian and the upper stage, Ukranian, with satellite fairings
built in the Seattle area. Despite reports that the Zenit 2 has
been launching satellites with only 75 percent reliability, Dolan
said Boeing tests show that the Zenit 3 should work at least 93
percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   The Zenit 3 will have full instrumentation, and will carry a
dummy satellite with the same weight and dimensions as Galaxy XI.
``We think the demonstration launch will be very valuable to
display the system to Sea Launch's present and future customers,''
Dolan said.
</P>
<P>
   The launch site is south of Hawaii at 154 degrees west
longitude. Being at the equator, it uses the earth's maximum
rotational force to sling satellites into orbit. An equatorial site
also allows a satellite to be shot into geostationary orbit without
having to change course. Both advantages allow a rocket to save
fuel, and thereby lift larger payloads.
</P>
<P>
   Work on the Sea Launch was halted over the summer by the State
Department because Boeing had discussed technical information with
its Russian and Ukranian partners without a U.S. government
representative present. Although the technology was not sensitive,
the meetings violated the terms of Boeing's license. Boeing agreed
to pay $10 million for fines and program modifications to have its
license reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   Work has now resumed, and the converted oil platform that will
be used as the project's floating launch pad has arrived from
Russia at the Sea Launch home port in Long Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The next step, expected in the next 30 days, is integrated
testing of the command ship and the launch platform at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing holds a 40 percent stake in Sea Launch, with the
remainder held by RSC-Energia of Moscow, KB Yuzhnoye/PO Yuzhmash of
Ukraine and Kvaerner Maritime of Norway.

BOEING: PROFITABILITY NEEDED BEFORE NEW ACQUISITIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The battering that The Boeing Co.'s stock has taken
over the last year has made new business acquisitions all but
impossible until the company can return to profitability, a top
Boeing executive said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our hoped for acquisitions have had to be put on hold
because you want to do those with stock swaps,'' said Larry
Clarkson, the former head of Boeing Enterprises who announced
Monday that he will retire early next year.
</P>
<P>
   As Boeing struggled this past year through serious production
problems in its Commercial Airplane Group, its stock has lost 40
percent of its value. It closed Tuesday 33 3/8 a share, compared to
its price of 54 3/4 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clarkson, in an interview with the Post-Intelligencer, did not
say what acquisitions Boeing Enterprises had been looking at.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing obviously has to get its core business back on track
and its profitability back on track in order to get its stock price
back on track and be in a position to pursue the basic mission of
Boeing Enterprises,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That mission, when Boeing Enterprises was formed early last year
with Clarkson in charge, was to find new aviation-related business
opportunities for Boeing to invest in. Clarkson, 60, a large jovial
man who become known as Boeing's ``secretary of state'' in his
previous job as Boeing's chief international strategist, went out
and did just that.
</P>
<P>
   Successful ventures include one with General Electric to build
737 business jets and another with FlightSafety International to
train pilots and aircraft maintenance crews.
</P>
<P>
   But while these ventures and several others have taken root, and
even flourished, the company's production woes overtook the promise
of Boeing Enterprises and finally led to a sweeping management
shakeup and reorganization with the firing Sept. 1 of Ron Woodard
as head of the commercial group.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Mulally, who had been running Boeing's defense and space
operation, replaced Woodard. Boeing Enterprises was scaled back and
folded into a new customer services group led by Tom Schick, who
had been Woodard's deputy and who now reports to Mulally.
</P>
<P>
   Clarkson's job was eliminated and he decided to retire rather
than take another job in Boeing. He is the last remaining member of
the senior staff of former Boeing Chairman Frank Shrontz and he has
represented Boeing in national and international matters during
three administrations since he joined the company in 1987 from
engine maker Pratt &AMP; Whitney, where, in 1982 at age 42, he become
the youngest president ever of Pratt's commercial jet engine
division.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear even before the recent reorganization that Boeing
Enterprises would have a diminished role while the company focused
on getting its commercial operations in order, Clarkson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty much a no brainer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the stock price, we just had to put a lot of things
on hold. That's why the decision was made to downsize Boeing
Enterprises for a period of time until the situation stabilized and
we get the core business back where it should be and the Boeing
stock price back to where it should be. Then Boeing will again be
in a position to make those kinds of acquisitions.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Clarkson would not say so publicly, company executives
had been counting on Boeing Enterprises to bring in up to $5
billion in additional revenue by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Clarkson said he remains optimistic the long-range financial
goals he set for Boeing Enterprises will be realized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given what's there now, like FlightSafety Boeing
International, and with a couple things I believe the company will
go ahead with, Boeing Enterprises will be well on its way to
achieving those financial goals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The businesses that we now have under our belt will thrive,''
he said. ``And there are one or two more that we are trying to
bring into the tent. But a lot of what we had hoped to do just has
to go on the shelf for a while. Boeing, though, is not going to
abandon this in the long term.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Boeing Business Jets and FlightSafety Boeing
International, Boeing Enterprises teamed with Czech national
airline CSA for a 35 percent stake in Aero Vodochody, the largest
aerospace company in the Czech Republic. That deal could help
Boeing land a multi-billion-dollar fighter order.
</P>
<P>
   Under Clarkson, Boeing Enterprises also invested in a Chinese
company that is now repairing and overhauling Boeing jets. And this
past June, Boeing Enterprises formed what's known as Boeing
Modification and Engineering Services. The goal of that unit is to
be much more aggressive in the marketplace in promoting the
aircraft modification work that now takes place mostly at the
company's plants in Wichita and in Long Beach, where the 747, DC-10
and MD-11 passenger jets are converted into freighters.
</P>
<P>
   These various business ventures by Boeing Enterprises, Clarkson
said, ``have paid off pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   The company recently announced that FlightSafety Boeing
International will be build its first European training center in
London.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the near term, we will be announcing several other
expansion facilities,'' Clarkson said. ``I'm very pleased how well
that's going.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Clark detailed the events that led to the
decision to consolidate Boeing Enterprises under Schick as part of
the new customer services business unit.
</P>
<P>
   Clarkson said he first talked with his former boss, Woodard, in
early summer about retiring, but Woodard talked him about of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt we had gotten Boeing Enterprises off to a good start
and it was going well,''Clarkson said, ``but it was also clear we
were going to have to scale back some of our activities because of
the commercial situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Woodard's organization of the Commercial Airplane Group,
Schick had served as ``Mr. Inside'' to Woodard's ``Mr. Outside,''
Clarkson said. While Schick ran day-to-day operations, Woodard
concentrated on airplane sales.
</P>
<P>
   That changed under Mulally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alan's approach to things is different,'' Clarkson said. ``He
doesn't intend to be Mr. Outside. He didn't need a Mr. Inside. So
one of the challenges was what kind of a job could be put together
that made sense and could use Tom's strengths.''
</P>
<P>
   Schick came out of customer service and had an airline
background.
</P>
<P>
   So Mulally made Schick head of the new customer services unit.
</P>
<P>
   Clarkson said he suggested that Boeing Enterprises be
consolidated into the new customer services business unit at his
first meeting with Mulally after Mulally replaced Woodard. The idea
was then discussed with Schick.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Clarkson said, he and Mulally talked about him
taking on a broad business development role within Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was excited about that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But that job went to Nancy Bethel, Boeing's highest ranking
female executive, who was head of sales and marketing but had been
out for several months on sick leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's in good health now, but she must be careful as she goes
forward to protect her health,'' Clarkson said. ``It wasn't clear
initially if she could continue in her sales and marketing role
that she had under Ron's organization. In the days that followed
Alan's appointment, it became clear she could not do that. So the
most obvious role for her was business development . . . That left
me out of the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarkson said he could have stayed with Boeing and would have
been given a job ``with a nice title.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want that kind of job,'' Clarkson said. ``I want to go
out and kill something . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that I'm overpaid but I'm paid a lot . . . In this day and
age, when Boeing clearly has to do some major headcount reductions,
if my retiring will let six younger people stay on the payroll, so
be it. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Clarkson, who has been active in the Seattle community and has
served for seven years as chairman of the Seattle Opera, said he
and his wife want to stay in Seattle. But he said he expects to
keep working.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm marketable,'' he said. ``I have a lot of contacts
in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Clarkson, who did yesterday's telephone interview from
his room at the Waldorf Historia hotel in New York City, planned to
see some of those industry friends last night during a dance at the
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will just have to see what develops,'' he said. ``I'm not
in a position where I have to work. But I want to work one way or
another.''

COMMENTARY: LAST TANGO IN D.C.  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ I've always loved stories about parallel universes.
</P>
<P>
   The notion is in vogue in Hollywood. In ``Sliding Doors,''
Gwyneth Paltrow played out two possible futures _ one if she caught
a subway, then met a cute guy on the train, and then got home in
time to catch her boyfriend cheating. The other, if she missed the
train and ended up staying with her loutish boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Demi Moore is filming ``Passion in Mind,'' in which she plays
Marie, a widow and literary critic in France with two children and
a lover, who dreams of Marty, a New York literary agent afraid to
settle down. Or is she Marty, dreaming of Marie?
</P>
<P>
   Lifetime will air ``Twice Upon a Time,'' with Molly Ringwald, in
which Molly, unsuccessful at work and bored with her boyfriend,
snaps a Thanksgiving wishbone and wakes up the next day successful
and married to a glamorous ex-boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is so vile now, so filled with sulfurous partisan
revenge tactics, so devoid of principle and accomplishments, that
the idea of escaping to a parallel universe is more alluring than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   I look through my mail. It's hard to tell if the letters from
liberals or conservatives are more foul. Since I'm a woman, both
sides dwell on my sex life. Both sides suggest I crave the
president for myself. (I don't.)
</P>
<P>
   One liberal wrote that I was ``a frigid man-hater'' who was
jealous of Monica. A Democratic woman from Texas railed, ``You
remind me of my goody-two-shoes, unattractive, good Catholic sister
Eileen, quick to judge and she the worst offender.''
</P>
<P>
   One Greenwich conservative thoughtfully reasoned that ``There
has been speculation as to who has been servicing the president now
that Monica is not available ... the answer is you!'' Another
penned, ``So do your lips have anything in common with Monica's?''
This from Louisiana: ``You and other swooning females ... feel a
need for mentally snuggling up to your slimy hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, they all sign their names.
</P>
<P>
   As I read, I yearn to metamorphose into a tango instructor at a
smoky club in Buenos Aires. Or a neurosurgeon with eight kids and a
border collie in New Mexico. Or a champagne farmer in France in
love with a neighboring cognac farmer. Or an archeologist in the
Yucatan who flies her own plane and owns a supper club called The
Fuzzy Slipper.
</P>
<P>
   Anything, as long as I am not a Washington journalist in the era
of Clinton and Gingrich and Starr, covering this horrible grudge
match between the right and the left that has been building since
Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   It's not enough for the Republicans just to prove the president
morally unfit. He must be Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   People keep talking about redemption when they just want
revenge.
</P>
<P>
   This great capital, once a place of gravity, has been reduced to
a keyhole. The Starr prosecutors spill all the mud into the street,
and then flatter themselves that they are discreet just because
they black out a few lines here and there. The president, by
turning his White House into a war room and a bachelor pad, began
the shame-spiral that has so cheapened the presidency and the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   The city is at once completely sexualized and completely
Puritanized. The city is dizzy and salacious and careerist and
TV-mad and full of fake morality and real hypocrisy. No one is
willing to make distinctions.
</P>
<P>
   My indelicate correspondents do not understand how I could
criticize Bill Clinton for lying and for turning his White House
into a place of lying and ugly tactics, and still not want to see
him impeached. I'm not being inconsistent. I'm just trying to make
distinctions in a complicated case.
</P>
<P>
   What Clinton did was reprehensible. But he doesn't deserve to
die for it. His presidency is already ruined _ he is the Andrew
Johnson of the counterculture _ and he can be penalized in any of a
number of ways that will not rend the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans have lost all sense of proportion. They are
absolutists, set on destroying the situationist in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   By releasing his secret grand jury testimony, Newt &AMP; Co. have
already enjoyed the sadistic pleasure of seeing Clinton squirm
about sex and cigars on TV for four hours. They should not also
have the sadistic pleasure of holding hearings on TV for the rest
of his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   You can't punish someone twice. This is still America. I think.
</P>

CONFLICTING PROTESTS AS `CORPUS CHRISTI' OPENS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CHRISTI-THEATER-REVIEW, moved in `e' category.) 
(bl) 
 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chanting prayers and waving placards with messages
like ``Blasphemous filth is not art,'' several hundred people from
various religious groups gathered outside City Center on Tuesday
night to protest the opening performance of ``Corpus Christi,'' the
Terrence McNally play about a gay Christ-like figure.
</P>
<P>
   Several yards from the theater on West 55th Street, hundreds of
people marched in support of the play, in a demonstration organized
by the People for the American Way Foundation and several other
free-speech groups. They carried placards bearing quotes about free
speech, including `` `A free society is one where it is safe to be
unpopular' (Adlai Stevenson)'' and `` `Free speech not only lives,
it rocks' (Oprah Winfrey).''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the building, playgoers were required to walk through a
metal detector to enter the auditorium. To help with security, the
Manhattan Theater Club, which produced the play, enlisted Kroll
Associates, a private investigation and security company, as well
as the New York City Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   The play, which is to run through Nov. 30, has been the focus of
considerable dispute since May, when the Manhattan Theater Club
received threats of violence in reaction to the play's homosexual
content. Initial press reports indicated that the play featured a
gay Christ-like figure who had sex with his apostles, though in
fact the play includes only kissing between the main character,
Joshua, and his friend Judas.
</P>
<P>
   McNally, the playwright, who had consistently declined to
comment on the fuss, saying he wanted the play to speak for itself,
broke his long silence last night to praise those who had publicly
supported his work. ``I'm very proud of the way the arts community
has come together on this,'' he said outside the theater before the
performance began. ``I would be out there marching on another
playwright's behalf.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Meadow, the artistic director of the Manhattan Theater
Club, and Barry Grove, the executive producer, were unavailable for
comment last night, but in a statement issued Tuesday, they said:
``Tonight the press will have the opportunity to express its views
on the completed script of `Corpus Christi' and the production.
Much of the judgment that has been issued against this play has
come from people who have not actually seen the play.''
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday night's demonstrations, police closed off one side of
the street and kept the different camps of protesters at opposite
ends of the block while ordering passers-by to keep moving. There
were no reports of problems or arrests at curtain time.
</P>
<P>
   The protest began with a fiery speech from William Donohue, the
president of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights,
which describes itself as the nation's largest Catholic civil
rights group and which organized the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   Holding a bullhorn inside an area barricaded by police, Donohue
shouted criticisms toward the opposing group. ``You are the real
authoritarians at heart,'' he said. ``We're the ones that believe
in tolerance, not you phonies.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in the Donohue crowd carried crosses, and one demonstrator
carried an American flag. One Catholic League member, Mary Trainor,
64, called the play ``a hate crime parading as art.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who marched in support of ``Corpus Christi'' were
playwright Tony Kushner, actor Wallace Shawn, and television
producer Norman Lear. ``This is one of the great celebrations,''
Lear said. ``Down the street are people who have the right to hate
a play. This group is full of people who believe everyone has a
right to free speech, including the most unpopular.''
</P>
<P>
   Kushner added, ``In a certain sense it's a celebration because
we won this fight. The play got on. They failed to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   While the theater had initially decided not to produce the play,
it went ahead as planned after an outcry from artists and civil
liberties organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have dreamed of not being here,'' said theatergoer
Ellie King, 66, who said she has been a Manhattan Theater Club
subscriber from its start in the 1970s. ``When I heard they might
cancel the performance, I was furious. This has nothing to do with
religion. This is theater.''

   DENVER _ Last Saturday morning, while Matthew Shepard lay
comatose from a beating, a college homecoming parade passed a few
blocks from his hospital bed in Fort Collins. Propped on a
fraternity float was a straw-haired scarecrow, labeled in black
spray paint: ``I'm Gay.''
</P>
<P>
   Few people missed the message. Three days earlier, Shepard, a
gay University of Wyoming freshman, was savagely beaten and tied to
a ranch fence in such a position that a passerby first mistook him
for a scarecrow.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, officials at Colorado State University reacted with
outrage to the fraternity float, opening an investigation and
disciplinary procedures against the fraternity, Pi Kappa Alpha. The
fraternity chapter immediately suspended seven members and said
they had acted independently.
</P>
<P>
   But in a week when candlelight vigils for Shepard were being
held on campuses across the nation, the scarecrow incident
highlighted how hostility toward gay people often flourishes in
high schools and universities, gay leaders said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would like to think that what happened to Matthew was
an exception to the rule but, it was an extreme version of what
happens in our schools on a daily basis,'' said Kevin Jennings,
executive director of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education
Network, a New York group dedicated to ending anti-gay bias in the
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard, a slightly built 21-year-old, died on Monday morning
from the injuries suffered in the beating. He never regained
consciousness after being discovered on the evening of Oct. 7, 18
hours after he was lashed to the fence. Two men, Russell Henderson,
21, and Aaron McKinney, 22, were arraigned late Monday night on
first-degree murder charges. Their girlfriends, Chasity Pasley, 20,
and Kristen Price, 18, have been arraigned as accessories after the
fact.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the killing, about 50 candelight vigils were
scheduled this week, from Texas to Vermont, from Wayne, Neb., to
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   At the Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins where Shepard was
in intensive care for five days, his parents, Dennis and Judy
Shepard, received about 6,000 electronic messages of condolences.
Tuesday, when funeral arrangements were announced for Friday in
Casper, Wyo., the hospital Web site received 30,000 hits an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Friends at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, Wyo., have set
up The Matthew Shepard Memorial Fund to raise money to pressure the
state legislature to pass anti-hate crime legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see his name going down in gay history as a catalyst for
renewed activism,'' said Matt Foreman, a former Wyomingite who
directs Empire State Pride Agenda, a gay political organization in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   From around the nation Tuesday, gay leaders stressed that campus
homophobia is not restricted to college towns in the Rocky Mountain
West.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in a survey of almost 4,000 Massachusetts high school
students, 22 percent of gay respondents said they skipped school in
the past month because they felt unsafe at school, and 31 percent
said they had been threatened or injured at school in the past
year. These percentages were about five times greater than the
percentages of heterosexual respondents. The survey was conducted
at 58 high schools by the Massachusetts Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate study of nearly 500 community college students in
the San Francisco area, 32 percent of male respondents said they
had verbally threatened gay people and 18 percent said they had
physically threatened or assaulted gay people. The study was
conducted this year by Karen Franklin, a forensic psychologist who
is a researcher at the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys of gay college students conducted in the late 1980s at
Yale University, Oberlin College, Rutgers University and Penn State
found that 16 percent to 26 percent had been threatened with
violence, and that 40 percent to 76 percent had been verbally
harassed, said the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, a lobbying
group based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a student group in Des Moines, Iowa, called Concerned
Students, recorded hallway and classroom conversations at five high
schools on 10 ``homophobia recording day.'' They estimated that the
average Des Moines high school student hears about 25 anti-gay
remarks every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nine out of 10 `teaching tolerance' courses weed out gays,''
Foreman said. ``There are a lot of people preaching anti-racism and
anti-semitism. But it is still very much OK to make anti-gay jokes,
to express anti-gay sentiments.''
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of the nation's 42 largest school districts, 76
percent do not train teachers on issues facing gay students, and 42
percent do not have policies to protect students from
discrimination based on sexual orientation, said the Gay, Lesbian
and Straight Education Network, which conducted the survey last
month.
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Collins, while hospital officials struggled with an
electronic avalanche of condolences, city police detectives were
investigating a different kind of e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, hours after Shepard's death, two gay organizations,
the Rainbow Chorus and the Lambda Community Center, received
identical messages applauding Shepard's murder. The messages closed
with the words: ``I hope it happens more often.''

IN METAL AND IN MINIATURE, CREATING OBJECTS OF DESIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Oct. 18) 
(JT) 
 By RITA REIF    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For 30 years Daniel Brush has led a double life _
as a painter and an object maker. His monumental abstract paintings
were exhibited in one-man shows here during the 1970s, at the
Phillips Collection (1974) and at the Corcoran Gallery of Art (1976
and 1977).
</P>
<P>
   But his exquisitely detailed steel and gold miniature objects _
boxes in the form of exotic temples, bowls with fragile butterflies
on the rims and paperweights in the shape of leaves _ were unknown
to the public until now. Last month, 70 of his objects went on view
here in ``Daniel Brush: Gold Without Boundaries,'' a retrospective
exhibition at the Renwick Gallery of the National Museum of
American Art. The show, through Jan. 10, coincides with the
publication of an elaborately illustrated book about the artist's
metal works (Harry N. Abrams, $65).
</P>
<P>
   At 51, the enigmatic Brush, a former professor of art history at
Georgetown University, is little known in the art world but has a
following of about 20 collectors, who snap up his works when any
become available. He says he seeks no gallery affiliation and
welcomes few visitors to his studio, in Manhattan. He prefers
instead to see people in his loft home, limiting such visits to the
collectors and curators he knows or who come recommended by friends
and clients. He speaks eloquently about his work but does not quote
prices, saying only that his pieces range ``from the mid-five
figures to well into six figures.''
</P>
<P>
   The preciousness of Brush's miniatures _ steel splashed with
gold and studded in some cases with diamonds, rubies or emeralds _
has inspired admirers to call him a late-20th-century Faberge.
Unlike the Russian jeweler to Romanov Czars, however, Brush does
not maintain a workshop, turning out thousands of items each year.
Instead, he works alone, producing everything by hand (including
his tools). At most, he makes five objects a year, each taking
hundreds, even thousands, of hours to complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faberge was never at the bench; he was a designer,'' said the
gem dealer Ralph Esmerian, a collector of Brush's work and the
president of the Museum of American Folk Art. ``Daniel is that rare
person who had crazy ideas and followed them through with his own
hands _ like the Renaissance goldsmith Cellini.''
</P>
<P>
   When he met Brush more than a decade ago, Esmerian admired the
Greek-style earrings that the artist was then producing, each
featuring minuscule strings of grainlike bits of gold. ``What
grabbed me was the granulation on his jewelry,'' Esmerian said.
``When you put your eyepiece to it, you see its clarity. I've never
before seen such precise granulation. His work in steel has great
tension in its marriage of that primitive metal with his highly
sophisticated technique.''
</P>
<P>
   The precision work in gold can also be seen in the micro mosaics
that cover the walls of Brush's dome boxes, like one called
``Justinian,'' which at three inches in diameter is just large
enough to store stamps or pills. Brush creates each piece in much
the way a dentist fills a tooth, pressing the metal into
irregularly shaped steel frames. The resulting tablets are of
varying thicknesses and not quite square. They have uneven surfaces
and are shaved at the corners so that the gold glows like a rainbow
in the light.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you know gold, the less you know about it,'' Brush
said. ``It's a strangely beguiling, mysterious material. Somedays I
see purple halos come off it, and other days it's just brittle.''
</P>
<P>
   Steel poses different challenges for the artist. ``I like the
deep blackness of it,'' Brush said. ``There are 5,200 varieties,
and I order steel for its alloy content. Alloys give steel
malleability and color. Chromium turns it blue and green, copper
red, and sometimes you get a fluorescent flamingo pink. I have no
idea why.''
</P>
<P>
   Brush said his fascination with objects began during a trip to
London with his family when he was 13. Seeing Chinese lacquer bowls
and Greek gold necklaces at the Victoria and Albert Museum, he
decided that he wanted to make objects like them himself. Objects
he saw at museums on later trips to Europe, Asia and North Africa
further stoked his creative urges. For the last 30 years he has
continued to find inspiration for his work abroad, traveling
extensively with his wife, Olivia, an artist, and their son, Silla.
</P>
<P>
   But it was an incident closer to home that inspired his creation
of lifelike insects with gold wings thinner than tissue paper. When
Silla was at camp 15 years ago, he and some friends released
monarch butterflies that they had raised, sending a burst of wings
into the summer sky. Brush said he was so awed by the butterflies'
sudden flight that he tried to capture that motion by designing
butterflies and bees fitted with magnets. ``You can take them off
and put them on your refrigerator if you choose,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   These days Brush is making steel objects that reflect the drawn
lines and moire-like imagery of his monochromatic oil paintings. He
chisels wavy patterns similar to those on the paintings on rocklike
forms or leaf-shaped blocks, then adds glittering splashes of gold.
Now his two lives are seemingly becoming one.

CENDANT DEAL WITH AMERICAN BANKERS IS OFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seven months and a lot of accounting problems after Cendant
Corp. beat out the big insurer, American International Group, in a
bruising battle to buy American Bankers Insurance Group, Cendant
announced Tuesday that the $3.1 billion deal was off.
</P>
<P>
   For its trouble, American Bankers, which specializes in life
insurance on credit card balances, will get $400 million as a
breakup fee, the companies said.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Silverman, chief executive of Cendant, a franchising and
discount shopping company, said the deal ``no longer made strategic
or financial sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The breakup was clearly the result of terrible times for
Cendant, which disclosed in April, a month after its successful bid
for American Bankers, that its earnings reports had been greatly
inflated by improper accounting procedures. Just last week Cendant
called off its $219 million purchase of Providian Auto and Home
Insurance Co., a unit of Aegon NV.
</P>
<P>
   By the close of the market Tuesday, shares of Cendant, which
owns brands like Century 21 real estate and Avis car rentals, were
trading at $9.4375, down from a high of about $42 when it was in
the midst of its battle for American Bankers. Moreover, Moody's
Investors Service had only the day before lowered Cendant's
financial ratings a notch so that borrowing would become more
expensive for Cendant.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're looking at here is a company with a broken story,
pressure on its financial ratings and an uncertain future,'' said
Kenneth Zuckerberg, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods.
</P>
<P>
   After American International Group had signed an agreement to
pay $47 a share for American Bankers, Silverman came in with a
hostile bid of $58. Maurice Greenberg, chief executive of American
International Group, matched the $58 bid. But he gave way when
Silverman raised his offer to $67 a share; 51 percent in cash, the
balance in stock.
</P>
<P>
   To go through with the deal at Tuesday's prices, Silverman would
have had to give American Bankers three times more Cendant shares
than originally anticipated or a lot more cash. He would have been
constrained from giving more shares, analysts said, because the
effect would have been to further dilute Cendant's sagging earnings
per share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cendant could afford to do the deal when it had a high-octane
stock,'' Zuckerberg said. ``Now they would have to use more cash
and with the cost of funds going up, that would have been very
expensive for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The accounting problems were discovered in what had been parts
of a company known as CUC International, with which Silverman
merged his former company, HFS Inc., to form Cendant last December.
CUC, which specialized in discount shopping clubs, sold its
products through lists of credit card holders just as American
Bankers does. So Silverman saw a good strategic fit.
</P>
<P>
   But as more details of the accounting problems became public,
Walter Forbes, chairman of Cendant, and eight other executives who
had essentially created CUC, resigned from Cendant, changing what
Silverman referred to Tuesday as the ``strategic premise'' for the
American Bankers acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said they thought that American International
might make a renewed bid for American Bankers. But a spokesman for
American International would not comment. Barbara Blanco, an
investor relations representative for American Bankers, said senior
executives were traveling and not available to discuss the breakup
or the company's future. Its shares, which had risen to $66.16,
closed Tuesday at $36.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 30, Cendant reported that after a reexamination of its
books, the company lost $217.2 million in 1997 instead of the $55.5
million in profits it reported before the accounting problems
surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   After the close of the market Tuesday, Cendant and American
Bankers issued a two-paragraph announcement that the deal was off.
Then Cendant issued a second, lengthy statement saying it planned
to buy back $1 billion of its own stock, a step often taken to
bolster share prices and investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Silverman has rapidly expanded his business empire through a
series of acquisitions. But, at least for the moment, his days as a
flamboyant buyer seem over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have articulated to the equity and credit markets that we
are no longer going to be a seller of shares and a buyer of
companies,'' he said, ``but a seller of companies and a buyer of
our own shares.''

AT IMPASSE, NBA CANCELS FIRST TWO WEEKS OF THE SEASON  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite modest encouragement over a new proposal
delivered by the players to the owners, the National Basketball
Association Tuesday canceled the first two weeks of the regular
season, the first time in the league's 51-year history that it will
lose games to a labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, announced the
cancellation after nearly three and a half hours of meetings
concluded at a Manhattan hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to cancel 99 games between Nov. 3 and Nov. 16 came
after the players association proposed the implementation of a tax
system instead of a hard salary cap, a proposal the owners said
they would respond to by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried our best today to try to do what was possible to
salvage the season,'' said Alonzo Mourning, the Miami Heat center.
``Unfortunately, it didn't work out.''
</P>
<P>
   After 35,001 games without a blemish, the NBA now joins the
National Hockey League, the National Football League and Major
League Baseball in having lost games to a labor dispute. Taking
into account that a three- to four-week period would be needed for
training camp and free-agent signings before the season starts, the
league said it would decide in two weeks whether to make further
cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very sad and disappointed,'' said the NBA commissioner,
David Stern. ``I consider it to be a collective failure, but I
honestly don't know what else we could have done. I do things that
I like to think are in the best interests of the game. And I
believe this is.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after what both sides agreed were the most
substantive talks since the owners imposed a lockout on the player
July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen players, including union president Patrick Ewing and
vice presidents Mitch Richmond, Herb Williams, Dikemebe Mutombo and
Ty Corbin, attended the meeting along with Stern, Granik and five
members of the ownership committee _ Madison Square Garden
president Dave Checketts and owners Abe Pollin of Washington,
Gordon Gund of Cleveland, Les Alexander of Houston and Jerry
Colangelo of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The talks featured what the players association implied were a
bevy concessions made to the owners that they felt would
accommodate the league's desire to swing the revenue pendulum back
toward the owners.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute involves the distribution of approximately $2
billion in league-wide income. The main sticking point has been the
owners' insistence on a salary cap without exceptions, the
implementation of which they believe would bring player salaries'
in line with revenue growth.
</P>
<P>
   While the players did not discuss the elimination of the Larry
Bird exception _ a clause that allows a player to secure any amount
of money he wants in re-signing with his current team _ they did
address the exception in their taxation proposal. The main points
were as follows:
</P>
<P>
   _ A 50 percent tax would be imposed on salary earned above $18
million, a clause that would affect only a few players who
exercised their Bird rights. For example, if a player made $20
million, the team would be forced to put $1 million into a fund
that would most likely be distributed to low-revenue teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be provisions made for some players,'' said
Jeffrey Kessler, the chief outside counsel for the union. ``We
don't want to do anything that would encourage Chicago from getting
Michael Jordan back. And I think the league feels the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is similar to the luxury tax proposed by the union
in 1995 during negotiations, but it would not be nearly as liberal.
</P>
<P>
   _ A salary cap credit would go into effect if the league pays
out more than 63 percent of revenues in salary. Whatever figure
over that number reduces the salary cap the next year. If the
figure was $29 million over the salary cap, then the 29 teams would
work with a salary cap $1 million less than the previous season.
But the players would have an assurance that the salary cap would
go up at least $2 million before the credit goes into effect.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also, if the 63-percent threshold is met, a reduction of
annual 20 percent raises would take effect for multi-year
contracts. Players would either get raises of 10 percent or the
rate of growth in league revenues. The union said this clearly
addresses the league's desire to bring salaries in line with
revenues. Since the owners re-opened the current agreement because
57.1 percent of revenue was going toward salaries, the 63-percent
figure would probably have to come down substantially for the
owners to agree to such a proposal.
</P>
<P>
   _ Teams would get a right of first refusal on free agents after
the fourth year for incoming rookies, meaning a player would be
contractually obligated to the same team for the first four years
of his deal. Currently, the rookie scale is three years and
includes a clause that enables a player to exercise his Bird rights
after two seasons _ a clause Kevin Garnett parlayed into an
astronomical $126 million deal last year with Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, the players agreed to make marijuana a banned
substance. Details of testing have not been negotiated and no
specific discussions took place regarding testing for
performance-enhancing drugs, a provision the owners included in
their last proposal.
</P>
<P>
   In return for the concessions, the players want an increase in
the minimum salary _ currently $272,500 _ and creation of an
average salary exception. This would allow every team above the
salary cap being able to sign one free agent per year for the
average salary _ currently $2.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're buoyed by the fact for the first time they've decided to
submit a counterproposal,'' the union's executive director, Billy
Hunter, said. ``I don't know if I'm more optimistic, but I can
earnestly say we can look our ballplayers in the eye and say we
made a valiant effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the players would finally be tested financially with
the cancellation of games, Hunter added: ``It's not about us
blinking. We want to reach an agreement. We're tired of the
rhetoric, we're tired of the game-playing. Our position all along
has been we don't want to accept a bad deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Granik said refunds to fans would be made at end of the calendar
month and that the first refund would include monies for canceled
preseason games. He estimated the losses into the ``hundreds of
millions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have serious concern whether a tax system can
address the kind of needs we have economically,'' he added. ``But
there's some possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Stern, ``We owe it to the fans to go back and look at the
notion whether a tax rate might begin to achieve the result we
wanted. It doesn't look promising, but we're going to spend the
next two days to see if we can give a favorable response.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the decision to cancel games was not surprising, it did
represent a major shift in prior labor stalemates. Both sides
reluctantly hammered out a deal in 1995 before the start of
training camp with the sole notion of not missing games and
preserving the NBA's perfect record. Tuesday, they could not come
to such an accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think these our the last games we have to
cancel,'' Granik said. ``But unless this or something else works,
or there's some dramatic breakthrough, I think that is certainly
not all of the season that's in jeopardy.''

REPUBLICANS MEET CLINTON AIDES ON IMF 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Members of the Clinton administration and
congressional Republican leaders met Tuesday to hammer out the
final details of compromise legislation that would provide the
International Monetary Fund with $18 billion in exchange for new
restrictions on its loans to foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional officials said that the deal, part of an overall
budget agreement between the administration and Capitol Hill
expected to be announced this week, would require the monetary fund
to stop making many of its loans at below-market interest rates and
compel borrowers to repay the loans within two and a half years.
</P>
<P>
   The fund currently makes most of its loans at below-market rates
of about 4.5 percent a year, with pay-back periods of about 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Under the compromise, congressional officials said, the fund
would also be required to publish summaries of its board meetings,
ending years of secrecy over the fund's loan deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Before meeting Tuesday with Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin,
House Republican leader Dick Armey of Texas said that an agreement
over IMF financing was so close that ``we're down to splitting
infinitives.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said that ``we've certainly
made significant progress'' and ``we seem to have rounded the
corner on the question of funding.''
</P>
<P>
   The new lending conditions had been demanded by House
Republicans, who for months have blocked approval of the full $18
billion requested by the Clinton administration to allow the fund
to deal with the global financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have accused the fund of overly generous lending
practices that encouraged some foreign governments, including those
that requested bailouts over the last year, to adopt reckless
economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that while some details of the
agreement were still under negotiation, they believed the final
plan would not put onerous restrictions on the fund as it attempts
to avert an international financial meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   The $18 billion would be used to replenish accounts that were
depleted by the fund's efforts to bail out the economies of Russia
and three Asia nations.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials had contacted other key donor nations
to the fund, including Japan, Germany and Britain, to determine
whether any would attempt to block the lending restrictions that
would be demanded of the fund under the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States is the largest and most influential
donor to the fund, it cannot dictate policy to the 182-nation
organization without the support of other large donor nations. ``I
don't think we have a problem with our allies on this,'' said an
administration official who is involved in the negotiations with
Congress. ``I think these reforms at the IMF will have widespread
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, congressional officials said, the Treasury
Department would be required to certify to Congress that the United
States and other large donor nations are bringing pressure on the
fund to limit its loans to nations that agree to open up their
trade policies.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders in Congress have asserted that bailout money
from the fund has been used by some foreign governments to
subsidize failing industries, creating unfair competition for
struggling industries in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Saxton, R-N.J., who is chairman of the House-Senate
Joint Economic Committee and a leading critic of the fund, said
that he was disappointed that the lending conditions being put on
the fund were not tougher.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he was pleased that the fund's activities were under
such intense scrutiny on Capitol Hill. ``We have begun a very
serious discussion of this institution,'' he said, predicting that
the next Congress would demand stricter reforms of the fund.

   DIXON, Ill. _ Watching classmates strut past in designer
clothes, Wendy Williams sat silently on the yellow school bus,
wearing a cheap belt and rummage-sale slacks.
</P>
<P>
   One boy stopped and yanked his thumb, demanding her seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Move it, trailer girl,'' he sneered.
</P>
<P>
   It has never been easy to live on the wrong side of the tracks.
But in the economically robust 1990s, with sprawling new houses and
three-car garages sprouting like cornstalks on the Midwestern
prairie, the sting that comes with scarcity gets rubbed with an
extra bit of salt.
</P>
<P>
   Seen through the eyes of a 13-year-old girl growing up at
Chateau Estates, a fancy name for a tin-plain trailer park, all the
rosy talk about the nation's general prosperity carries a certain
mocking echo.
</P>
<P>
   The everyday discussion in the halls of Reagan Middle School in
this city about 100 miles west of Chicago touches on computer toys
that can cost $1,000, family vacations to Six Flags or Disney World
and designer clothes with recognizable labels like the Nike Swoosh
or Tommy Hilfiger's logo.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike young people a generation ago, those today must typically
pay fees to play sports for the school sports teams or band. It
costs $45 to play in the youth summer soccer league.It takes money
to go skating on weekends at the White Pines roller rink, to play
laser tag or rock-climb at the Plum Hollow Recreation Center, to
mount a steed at the Horseback Riding Club, to gaze at Leonardo
DiCaprio and Kate Winslet at the Plaza Cinemas, to go shopping for
clothes at Cherryvale Mall.
</P>
<P>
   To be without money, in so many ways, is to be left out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told this girl, `That's a really awesome shirt. Where did
you get it?'' said Wendy, explaining that she knew it was out of
her price range, but that she wanted to join the small talk. ``And
she looked at me and laughed and said, `Why would you want to
know?'''
</P>
<P>
   A lanky, soft-spoken girl with large brown eyes, Wendy pursed
her lips to hide a slight overbite that got her the nickname
Rabbit, a humiliation she once begged her mother and father to
avoid by sending her to an orthodontist.
</P>
<P>
   For struggling parents, keenly aware that adolescents agonize
over the social pecking order, the styles of the moment and the
face in the mirror, there is a no small sense of failure in telling
a child that she cannot have what her classmates take for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know what it's like?'' asked Wendy's mother, Veronica
Williams, ``to have your daughter come home and say, `Mom, the kids
say my clothes are tacky,' and then walk off with her head hanging
low.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the desperate poverty of Chicago housing projects,
where the plight of empty pockets is worsened by the threat of
gangs and gunfire. Wendy lives in relative safety in a home with
both parents. Her father, Wendell Provow, earns $9 an hour as a
welder. Her mother works part-time as a cook for Head Start, a
federal education program for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike students in some urban pockets, isolated from affluence,
Wendy receives the same education as a girl from a $300,000 house
in the Idle Oaks subdivision. The flip side of that coin is the
public spectacle of economic struggle. This is a place small enough
where people know the personal stories, or, at least, repeat them
as if they did.
</P>
<P>
   Even in this down-to-earth town, where a poor boy nicknamed
Dutch grew up to become president, young people seem increasingly
enchanted with buying, having, spending and status.
</P>
<P>
   R. Woodrow (Woody) Wasson, the principal at Reagan Middle
School, makes it a point to sit down with every child and ask them
about their hopes and dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to be doctors, lawyers, veterinarians and, of
course, professional athletes,'' said Wasson, whose family roots
here go back to the 19th century. ``I don't remember the last time
I heard somebody say they wanted to be a police officer or a
firefighter. They want to do something that will make a lot of
money and have a lot of prestige.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a teacher in a nearby town has been trying to recruit
high school students for vocational studies to become tool-and-die
artisans, a trade that can pay $70,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teacher can't fill the slots,'' Wasson said. ``Nobody's
interested in that kind of work.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that children grow up believing that money
is so important, given the relentless way they are targeted by
marketers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, you just put an ad in the magazine,'' said
Michael Wood, the director of research for Teen-age Research
Unlimited, a marketing consultant in suburban Chicago. ``Now savvy
marketers know you must hit them at all angles _ Web sites, cable
TV shows, school functions, sporting events.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted the growth of cross-promotions, like the deal in which
actors on the television show ``Dawson's Creek,'' which is popular
among adolescents, wear clothes by J. Crew and appear in its
catalog.
</P>
<P>
   But young people get cues in their everyday lives. Some spending
habits that would once have been seen as ostentatious _ extravagant
parties for small children, new cars for teen-agers _ have become
familiar trappings of middle-class comfort.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market, although it is sputtering now, has made
millionaires of many people in Main Street towns. Building
developers here recently won approval to build a gated community,
which will be called Timber Edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wendy goes to school around these rich kids,'' her mother
said, ``and wonders why she can't have things like they do.''
</P>
<P>
   A bright girl with a flair for art, writing and numbers, Wendy
stays up late most nights, reading books.``The Miracle Worker'' was
a recent favorite.
</P>
<P>
   But when a teacher asked her to join an elevated class for
algebra, she politely declined. ``I get picked on for my clothes
and living in the trailer park,'' said Wendy, who never brings
anyone home from school. ``I don't want to get picked on for being
a nerd, too.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, who watched three other daughters drop out of school
and have babies as teen-agers, has told Wendy time and again:
``Don't lose your self-esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   One time a boy at school was teasing Wendy about her clothes _
``They don't even match,'' he laughed _ and her humble house in the
trailer park.
</P>
<P>
   She listened for a while. He kept insulting her. So she lifted a
leg _ clothed as it was in discount jeans from the Farm &AMP; Fleet
store _ and kicked him in the shins.
</P>
<P>
   He told the authorities. She got the detention.
</P>
<P>
   It became clear to Wendy that the insults were not going to
stop. It also became clear that shin-kicking, however deserved, was
not going to be the solution.
</P>
<P>
   She went to a guidance counselor, Cynthia Kowa Basler, a dynamic
woman who keeps close tabs on the children, especially girls who
fret about their weight and suddenly stop eating lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am large,'' she tells the girls, ``and I have self-esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendy, who knew that Mrs. Basler held sessions with students to
increase their self-confidence, went to the counselor and asked for
help. ``I feel a little down,'' Wendy told her. The counselor
gathered a group of eight students, including other girls like
Wendy, who felt embarrassed about their economic station.
</P>
<P>
   In this school named for Ronald Reagan, the students were told
to study the words of Eleanor Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   One of her famous quotes was posted above the counselor's desk:
``No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.''
</P>
<P>
   As a group, the students looked up the definition of inferior
and consent.
</P>
<P>
   And then they read the words out loud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again,'' the counselor instructed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Louder,'' the counselor insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, they read the inspirational words, until they
had the words memorized.
</P>
<P>
   In role-playing exercises, the children practiced responses to
taunts, which sometimes called for nothing more than a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Basler told us to live up to our goals _ show those
kids,'' Wendy said. ``She told us that things can be a lot
different when you're grown up. Maybe things will be the other way
around then.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendy smiled at the notion.
</P>
<P>
   Life still has plenty of bumps. When Wendy gets off the school
bus _ the trailer park is the first stop, so everyone can see where
she lives _ she still looks at her shoes.
</P>
<P>
   She still pulls her shirt out to hide a belt that does not quite
make the grade. And she still purses her lips to hide an overbite.
But her mother has noticed her smiling more these days. And Wendy
has even said she might consider taking an advanced course in math,
her favorite subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go to college,'' Wendy said the other day. ``I want
to become a teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   One recent day, she popped in to see the counselor's office,
just to say hello, then walked back down the halls, her arms folded
around her schoolbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Basler stood at the doorway and watched her skip away, a
student with so much promise, and so many obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   For the girl from Chateau Estates, it is a long way from the
seventh grade to college.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's going to make it,'' the counselor said, with a clenched
fist and a voice full of hope.

 WASHINGTON: White House.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some conservatives Republicans said they were cautious over the
emerging shape of the final package, particularly elements dealing
with family planning and with emergency spending. They say the
president's proposals for emergency spending, on such items as the
peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, fixing the Year 2000 computer bug
and providing relief to American farmers, would break the limits of
last year's blanced-budget agreement. The administration said such
money would come from corresponding cuts elsewhere in the budget,
but conservatives say it comes from raiding the budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   If House Republican leaders cannot count on their conservatives,
they would need support from Democrats to pass the final package.
And Democrats on Tuesday expressed concern over some of the White
House positions, such as on the census and an apparent compromise
with Republicans on aid for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., and a leader of House
conservatives, said he believed Republican leaders were ceding too
quickly to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is getting what he wants, he's controlling the
situation,'' McIntosh said. ``When you see Trent on television,
it's in reaction to the president,'' he said of the Senate
Republican leader, Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Mcintosh suggested he could vote for a final
accord. ``Most conservatives are holding out for a better deal than
we're hearing,'' he said, ``but we'll probably give them the vote
because we don't see a much better alternative happening if it goes
down.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Others were distressed, particularly about two issues concerning
contraceptives. One would require federal health plans to cover
contraceptives. The other would bar overseas family planning
organizations from lobbying to change abortion laws in other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., said he wanted to see the final
language on the health-plan measure. As it passed both the House
and Senate, it allowed for health plans with religious affiliation
to decline to offer contraceptive coverage; Coburn wants plans to
be able to refuse such coverage on moral grounds as well.
</P>
<P>
   The plan covers five specific types of contraception. Coburn
said he wanted two of those _ Depo Provero and interuterine devices
_ to be eliminated from coverage because he said they interfered
with fertilization and were therefore considered to cause
abortions. He said did not consider birth-control pills as causing
abortions unless they were taken as morning-after pills.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats like Rep. Nita Lowey of New York, who introduced the
contraceptive plan in the House, said she strongly objected to
Coburn's position. She said that health plans based their decisions
on what to offer on profits, not morals.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether the White House, which is conducting the
negotiations with Republican leaders, will insist on keeping the
contraceptive coverage in the final package and will oppose the
moral exception. If the administration allows the moral exception,
it could alienate some House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats are also worried about the direction the talks
are taking on the census. This has always loomed as one of the
biggest issues separating Democrats and Republicans. The census
results help determine the future power of the two political
parties. But the fact that the two sides are finally talking about
it now indicates that they are covering the full range of budget
matters that need to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has proposed buying time on the matter by
financing the Commerce, State and Justice Departments only for five
months. The Commerce Department houses the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said this would put off the nettlesome
issue while allowing a resolution of the entire spending package,
but House Democrats worry it would be a prelude to giving in to the
Republicans down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders like the idea of postponing a decision but
say that financing should be restricted only for the Census Bureau,
not the entire departments of Commerce, State and Justice. They
worry that this could eventually backfire and shut down vitally
needed parts of the government.
</P>
<P>
   On a slew of touchy environmental issues that have prompted
repeated veto threats from the White House, the two sides appeared
to be opting for compromise over confrontation, with several
disputes resolved. But a few particularly difficult issues remained
under negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers backed away from several of their proposals,
administration officials and environmental lobbyists said. The
White House gave ground on other issues, such as a provision
delaying the implementation of new mining regulations.
</P>
<P>
   A compromise deal was struck between the White House and Alaskan
lawmakers on logging in the Tongass National Forest. But compromise
still eluded them on the question of building a new road to connect
two communities in Alaska, opposed by environmentalists because it
would cut through a wilderness refuge.

 &HT;    Reno prepares to name Rudolph; couple confirms powder sale
 &HT;    By Kathy Scruggs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A Nashville man who told federal agents he sold
Birmingham bombing suspect Eric Robert Rudolph the smokeless powder
allegedly used in the Centennial Olympic Park bomb said he and his
wife were subpoenaed to appear before a federal grand jury here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a press conference has tentatively been scheduled for
today in Washington, when U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno is
expected to announce that Rudolph has been charged in three Atlanta
bombings, officials with the Southeast Bomb Task Force said Monday.
A second press conference is scheduled in Atlanta Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   David Mosley, a Nashville businessman who started a sideline
company selling ammunition and other supplies to gun enthusiasts
and hunters in 1993, said he has been told that his evidence is
among the strongest linking Rudolph to the July 1996 park blast
that killed an Albany woman and injured 111 people.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law enforcement officials would not publicly confirm
that Mosley was subpoenaed or that a grand jury is hearing
testimony in the Atlanta bombing cases, citing grand jury secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley said he conducted transactions with a man who used the
name Bob Randolph at three gun shows. At the first, in Nashville in
March 1994, ``Randolph'' paid $400 in cash for 8 pounds of 5
Accurate Arms brand smokeless powder and 8 pounds of 9 Accurate
Arms powder, Mosley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randolph'' also ordered ``a bunch of lead bullets'' and 32
pounds of Accurate Arms 7 smokeless powder, which he picked up two
weeks later at a gun show in Sparta, Tenn., Mosley said.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley's wife, who was at the Sparta show, later identified
``Randolph'' as Eric Rudolph when federal agents presented a photo
lineup, Mosley said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Sparta show, the man bought 20,000 lead bullets for .45
caliber, .38 caliber, and 9mm handguns and 10,000 rounds of .223
caliber ammunition used in an AR-15, a semi-automatic rifle. A
federal wanted poster for Rudolph says he owns and is probably
armed with an AR-15.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley, who has not been charged with a crime, said he
remembered ``Randolph'' mostly from the Sparta show because the
name he gave was the same last name as an Olympian shooter. Mosley
said the orders were not uncommonly large for gun enthusiasts who
reload bullets for hunting and target practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``And believe it or not, he wrote a check to me for $622 using
the name Bob Randolph,'' he said. ``It was the biggest sale I had
ever made. I wrote him a receipt.'' Federal agents have said
Rudolph didn't trust or use banks.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, at a Knoxville gun show, Rudolph bought about
$30 worth of boxed ammunition, Mosley said.
</P>
<P>
   Cherokee County, N.C., Sheriff Jack Thompson said as early as
January that Rudolph sometimes used the name Bob Randolph.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph remains a fugitive in western North Carolina where about
80 federal and state law enforcement agents are looking for him. He
is charged in the Jan. 29 bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic
that killed an off-duty police officer and severely injured a
nurse, and agents have said they want to question him in the
Atlanta bombings.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1996, three bombs of galvanized steel pipes packed with
smokeless powder and taped together with concrete flooring nails
were left under a bench in Centennial Olympic Park. Not all of them
ignited properly, investigators have said.
</P>
<P>
   Later bombs, in January 1997 at a Sandy Springs abortion clinic,
in February 1997 at a gay club on Piedmont Road and this January at
the Birmingham clinic, were dynamite, federal agents have said.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley said investigators told him a powder canister identical
to the ones Rudolph bought from him was found during a search of
some of his belongings found in North Carolina. A federal lab has
confirmed that the powder Rudolph bought from Mosley was consistent
with the powder used in the park bomb, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   According to a task force document, the park bomb was packed
with 7 or 9 Accurate Arms powder, which is manufactured in
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley said that's an amateur bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why he used that,'' Mosley said. ``There's not
enough energy. It won't pack right. There's not enough nitro in it
to make a real big bang. Those are slow-burning pistol powders. I
don't think he knew what he was doing. Black powder would have made
a huge hole in the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosley told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in a recent
interview in Nashville that he and his wife were stunned to see
Rudolph's picture flash across their television screen after the
Birmingham bombing. Rudolph was sought for questioning within hours
of that blast outside the abortion clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time she saw it on TV, my wife remembered him,''
Mosley said. ``She said, 'That's the guy we sold the powder to.' At
the time I didn't worry about it. For all I knew, he was just using
it for reloading.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosley said it wasn't until he told a customer about the sales
that he was questioned by agents. Mosley said he didn't know at the
time his customer was also an FBI agent.
</P>
<P>
   Agents ``have questioned me three or four times and they've
questioned my wife twice,'' Mosley said. Mosley declined to give
his wife's name because, he said, she is ill.

 &HT;    Faithful amass to hear last pronouncement
 &HT;    By Peter Scott and Virginia Anderson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONYERS, Ga. _ A church in honor of the Virgin Mary, a saint as
a role model for the young and a call for everyone to be holy
witnesses: This was the final message that Nancy Fowler told the
world she received from the Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   As local, national and international news media documented the
drama, more than 100,000 pilgrims packed Fowler's 90-acre farm in
Conyers, southeast of Atlanta on Ga. 138.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my dear little children. God is all loving. And you will
reach him by imitating him,'' a pensive Fowler said the Blessed
Mother told her. ``Please be attentive. My son's heart is drenched
in mercy and love for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said the crowd, which was orderly and well organized, was
Fowler's largest since hordes of people first began flocking to the
farm in 1990 to hear the holy messages Fowler said she receives on
the 13th day of each month.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic, police said, was clogged on highways as far away as
Augusta, 100 miles away, with people trying to reach the farm for
Fowler's last public message.
</P>
<P>
   Worshippers had been praying and singing since daybreak Tuesday
in anticipation of the message, which Fowler was scheduled to
deliver at 1:45 p.m. As the day progressed, the sun bore down,
oppressing some to the point that they passed out from the heat.
Believers collected so much blessed water, the farm's well ran dry.
Around noon, a single white cloud floated across the sky, creating
somewhat of a stir of excitement among the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   By 2:15 p.m., though, the cloud had vanished as Fowler emerged
from what she calls her ``apparition room,'' located in the front
of her one-story rustic farmhouse. As Fowler strode to the
platform, a hushed silence fell over the crowd. Only the cries of a
baby could be heard off in the distance, along with a police
officer ordering a pedestrian to get out of the street.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a brown jacket, brown blouse and a brown skirt,
Fowler was flanked by 20 priests from around the world as she spoke
to the crowd:
</P>
<P>
   ``.....Please pray the Rosary. Please pray against the evils of
this age,'' Fowler said. ``Please stop offending God. You have yet
to see the forces of nature. No man is greater than God. No country
is greater than God. If you choose to live apart from God, then you
will fall...''Fowler went on to say that the Virgin Mary also had
implored her to build a church at the farm, which she said she will
do, and she said she was told to tell young people to choose a
saint to emulate. Fowler said that many souls would ascend from
Purgatory on Tuesday as a special grace and blessing, drawing a
thunderous applause from the multitude. Many Roman Catholics
believe souls ascend to heaven on Christmas Day.
</P>
<P>
   In closing, Fowler said to the audience: ``Today, our Lady has
come for the last time in this way. We will not be able to see our
Lady again, until we are all in heaven,'' Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
   After the 30-minute message, Fowler invited all priests in the
crowd to join her for a special message Mary had for them. Several
later said that Fowler encouraged them to be faithful and loving.
</P>
<P>
   Several people trying to prove the authenticity of Fowler's
visions were on hand Tuesday to speak to the crowds before Fowler's
address. Fowler has said that she receives a holy message on the
13th of each month. She has shared eight messages publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Nancy was tested, what the doctors found was that Nancy
is as normal as you and I,'' said Ron Tesoriero, an Australian
lawyer and television producer who has been documenting Fowler's
claims since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church, however, has not given its blessings to
Fowler's claims
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Castanon, a Bolivian neuropsychophysiologist who
specializes in stigmata and weeping statues, said that he hoped the
Vatican in due time would recognize Fowler as legitimate. He told
the group ``there are visionaries who are not genuine, but Fowler
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Captain Tommy Eaton of the Rockdale County Sheriff's department
said it took 10 hours to get all who wanted access to the farm
inside. It took about six hours to help them leave. Even as Fowler
prepared to give her message, some of the 253 buses and 8,000 cars
at the event were still streaming down White Road to her farm.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Jatcko, a spokesman for Fowler, says that $300,000 was
spent paying for off-duty police and medical personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler said she has more to say to her believers but they have
to get it from the internet.

   NEW YORK _ Chanting prayers and waving placards with messages
like ``Blasphemous filth is not art,'' several hundred people from
various religious groups gathered outside City Center on Tuesday
night to protest the opening performance of ``Corpus Christi,'' the
Terrence McNally play about a gay Christ-like figure.
</P>
<P>
   Several yards from the theater on West 55th Street, hundreds of
people marched in support of the play, in a demonstration organized
by the People for the American Way Foundation and several other
free-speech groups. They carried placards bearing quotes about free
speech, including `` `A free society is one where it is safe to be
unpopular' (Adlai Stevenson)'' and `` `Free speech not only lives,
it rocks' (Oprah Winfrey).''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the building, playgoers were required to walk through a
metal detector to enter the auditorium. To help with security, the
Manhattan Theater Club, which produced the play, enlisted Kroll
Associates, a private investigation and security company, as well
as the New York City Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   The play, which is to run through Nov. 30, has been the focus of
considerable dispute since May, when the Manhattan Theater Club
received threats of violence in reaction to the play's homosexual
content. Initial press reports indicated that the play featured a
gay Christ-like figure who had sex with his apostles, though in
fact the play includes only kissing between the main character,
Joshua, and his friend Judas.
</P>
<P>
   McNally, the playwright, who had consistently declined to
comment on the fuss, saying he wanted the play to speak for itself,
broke his long silence last night to praise those who had publicly
supported his work. ``I'm very proud of the way the arts community
has come together on this,'' he said outside the theater before the
performance began. ``I would be out there marching on another
playwright's behalf.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Meadow, the artistic director of the Manhattan Theater
Club, and Barry Grove, the executive producer, were unavailable for
comment last night, but in a statement issued Tuesday, they said:
``Tonight the press will have the opportunity to express its views
on the completed script of `Corpus Christi' and the production.
Much of the judgment that has been issued against this play has
come from people who have not actually seen the play.''
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday night's demonstrations, police closed off one side of
the street and kept the different camps of protesters at opposite
ends of the block while ordering passers-by to keep moving. There
were no reports of problems or arrests at curtain time.
</P>
<P>
   The protest began with a fiery speech from William Donohue, the
president of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights,
which describes itself as the nation's largest Catholic civil
rights group and which organized the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   Holding a bullhorn inside an area barricaded by police, Donohue
shouted criticisms toward the opposing group. ``You are the real
authoritarians at heart,'' he said. ``We're the ones that believe
in tolerance, not you phonies.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in the Donohue crowd carried crosses, and one demonstrator
carried an American flag. One Catholic League member, Mary Trainor,
64, called the play ``a hate crime parading as art.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who marched in support of ``Corpus Christi'' were
playwright Tony Kushner, actor Wallace Shawn, and television
producer Norman Lear. ``This is one of the great celebrations,''
Lear said. ``Down the street are people who have the right to hate
a play. This group is full of people who believe everyone has a
right to free speech, including the most unpopular.''
</P>
<P>
   Kushner added, ``In a certain sense it's a celebration because
we won this fight. The play got on. They failed to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   While the theater had initially decided not to produce the play,
it went ahead as planned after an outcry from artists and civil
liberties organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have dreamed of not being here,'' said theatergoer
Ellie King, 66, who said she has been a Manhattan Theater Club
subscriber from its start in the 1970s. ``When I heard they might
cancel the performance, I was furious. This has nothing to do with
religion. This is theater.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the nation's biggest brokerage
firm, said Tuesday that it would eliminate about 3,400 jobs, or
just more than 5 percent of its work force, because of global
economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   The firm is the first big financial company to announce cutbacks
linked primarily to the world's troubled financial markets. Other
Wall Street firms, which along with Merrill had swelled their ranks
on the fat profits of the rampant bull market, are expected to
follow suit. Merrill said it expected ``a much more challenging
environment ahead'' for financial companies.
</P>
<P>
   The job cuts, which the firm said would save $500 million a
year, are expected to fall heavily on New York City, where Merrill
said it would dismiss up to 700 of its 10,500 employees. Altogether
in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, the firm said it would lay
off 1,100 employees and 500 full-time consultants and eliminate 400
more jobs through attrition. As many as 800 of the total cuts will
be made through attrition.
</P>
<P>
   But jobs will be lost across the company, Merrill executives
said, with 2,000 coming in the United States and 1,400 coming
overseas. In Europe, for example, the company plans to eliminate
400 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill also said it would dismiss 900 full-time consultants,
who are mostly involved in technology projects, although David H.
Komansky, Merrill's chairman and chief executive, insisted in an
interview Tuesday that this would not hamper the company's ability
to deal with either Europe's coming introduction of the euro or
computer problems associated with the year 2000. Merrill, like many
financial firms, retains many full-time consultants, particularly
for technology projects, who are not employees.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill, the nation's largest brokerage firm, also reported a
loss of $164 million, or 49 cents a share, for the three months
that ended on Sept. 30 after taking a $430 million charge, or $288
million after taxes, to pay for the job cuts. Excluding that
charge, Merrill showed a profit of $124 million for the quarter as
earnings were squeezed by the slowdown in underwriting and
securities trading and the fallout from worldwide economic turmoil.
In the third quarter of 1997, a much rosier time for securities
firms, Merrill earned $502 million. This year's third quarter
represented Merrill's first quarterly loss since the fourth quarter
of 1989, when the firm was in the midst of cutting 9,000 people, or
18 percent of its work force, over roughly two years.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani expressed dismay in an interview Tuesday
about the layoffs at Merrill, which he said was the largest
employer in the city. But he was sympathetic about the cutbacks,
saying: ``This is not something they're doing because they want to
do it. This is something they're doing because they have problems
on Wall Street right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The city is better able to withstand a downturn on Wall Street
than it was in the past, the mayor said, adding that he has
expected the downturn for years.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor acknowledged that the layoffs were bad news for
the city. ``Wall Street has also a psychological impact on the city
of New York because people who aren't directly affected by it make
decisions about how much they're going to spend, when they're going
to spend it, based on what's happening on Wall Street,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Merrill Lynch received $28 million in tax incentives
from the city and state in return for agreeing to add 2,000
employees over 15 years to the 9,000 it had at the time. Even after
the current round of layoffs, Merrill will have 9,800 employees in
the city, the company said in a statement, ``and we are fully
confident that our strategy for long-term growth in all of our
businesses will enable us to meet our employment commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill's job cuts and its forecast of tougher times to come
Tuesday cast a shadow over Wall Street, which until July had
enjoyed its most profitable years in living memory. ``Those of us
in the equity business say there but for the grace of God go we,''
said Sallie Krawcheck, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein &AMP; Co., a New
York securities firm. But she added, ``If Merrill is right, there
will be more layoffs and more poor quarters for the industry,''
which is one of New York's biggest employers, and certainly its
richest business.
</P>
<P>
   The job cuts at Merrill, which are expected to fall heavily on
bond specialists, were widely expected after Japan's economic
problems deepened and Russia abrogated its debts in mid-August,
casting a pall over the world's bond and credit markets. The
company in recent weeks would say only that it was ``reviewing the
matter,'' but there had been media reports that the cutbacks would
range from more than 1,000 to as many as 3,000 jobs and would be
concentrated in the bond and emerging-markets divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Along with recently announced job cuts at the new Citigroup _
the combination of Travelers Group and Citicorp _ and others now
being considered at several other financial companies, the cuts at
Merrill are likely to affect the New York economy, particularly
local consumer spending and the real estate market. The cuts at
Citigroup, however, are in part related to the recent merger,
although they also included a significant scaling back of the
riskier bond businesses at Salomon Smith Barney, Citigroup's
investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill's financial results also seemed to disappoint analysts
Tuesday. ``This is clearly not being viewed as a one-quarter
problem,'' said Charles Hill, director of research at First Call, a
research firm in Boston. ``This came in way below expectations for
the quarter, and analysts are cutting their estimates for the
coming year.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Strauss, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., said, ``We
were all expecting the revenues to be weak, but the expenses were
just very high across the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is partly the result of an aggressive expansion policy
the year before the downturn in the securities markets,'' he added,
referring to Merrill's rapid growth in recent months. Nevertheless,
Merrill's stock price rose $1.0625 Tuesday, to $44.9375, but is
still well below its high of nearly $110 in July.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Komansky defended Merrill's rapid expansion of recent years, and
particularly its adventurous acquisitions here and abroad. ``Many
of them were transforming the nature of this firm,'' he said, and
``fit in with our global strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other big brokerage firms _ Paine Webber Group and
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Inc. _ also reported lower earnings
Tuesday as they, too, suffered from the slower securities markets.
At Paine Webber, which has a large nationwide brokerage business,
earnings fell to $82.9 million, or 51 cents a share, from $112.8
million in the quarter a year earlier, just beating a consensus of
analysts' estimates. Donaldson, Lufkin reported earnings of $25.7
million, or 15 cents a share, for the quarter, down almost 80
percent from the quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bond market, credit crash round the world,'' said
Donald Marron, chairman and chief executive of Paine Webber, in an
interview Tuesday about the difficulties in financial markets. His
firm, which has much smaller international and capital markets
businesses than Merrill, is not scaling back, he said, but he
expressed concern that the international economy might adversely
effect the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Merrill cuts are likely to be followed by other firms in the
coming weeks. ``Notifications started going out today,'' Jonathan
Humphreys, a Merrill spokesman, said Tuesday. Komansky said he
hoped that there would not be further job cuts down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Some Merrill employees were angry that the firm is making deep
job cuts so soon after it put up $300 million to help rescue
Long-Term Capital Management LP, the hedge fund in Greenwich, Conn.
A deferred compensation plan for Merrill's top executives,
including Komansky, has money invested in the fund. ``I can
understand people who are being downsized and laid off feeling that
kind of thing,'' Komansky said. ``It's something I feel terrible
about. It's not something that's easy, but it's about managing your
cost base to maintain profitability.''
</P>
<P>
   At the World Financial Center in downtown Manhattan, where
Merrill Lynch has its headquarters, employees seemed glum but
resigned about the announcement of job cuts. ``It's just the normal
ups and downs of the market,'' said one worker, who would not give
his name. ``Sometimes these things happen, you know?''

 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
COLLEGE STATION _ Two years ago in the high school football
playoffs, Ja'Mar Toombs ended his junior year at Kilgore with a
disappointing loss to Dallas Lincoln.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It wasn't a happy night for the powerful running back, but
Toombs soon would find out his disappointment over that defeat
would pale compared to the loss he would hear about the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``My stepbrother, Christopher, was killed in Louisiana on the
same night of that game,'' Toombs said. ``He was 20. They didn't
tell me until the next day. I couldn't believe it until I went to
the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in a bad place at a bad time, shooting dice. A man held
up the place and shot him. There hasn't been a day go by since then
that I haven't thought about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher would not be considered a role model for Ja'Mar, but
Christopher was the person Ja'Mar confided in and listened to about
the struggles of life.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher was three years older than Ja'Mar, but Christopher
had taken the hard road and gotten in with a bad crowd as a high
school dropout. It was a path he wanted to be sure Ja'Mar didn't
take.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to always tell me to keep my head on straight and go
to college,'' Toombs said. ``He told me the streets weren't for me,
and he wanted me to know there were better things in life than what
he had done.''
</P>
<P>
   Toombs is doing some of those better things now as the starting
fullback for Texas A&AMP;M as a true freshman. His dramatic 71-yard run
Saturday set up a touchdown and helped the Aggies defeat No. 2
Nebraska 28-21 for one of the biggest victories in school history.
</P>
<P>
   Toombs rushed for 110 yards and one TD on 10 carries, prompting
the crowd of 60,798 to fill Kyle Field with a collective
``Toooooombs'' every time he touched the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the other freshman players started it,'' Toombs said.
``When I got the ball on the field, they were doing it on the
sideline, and I think people heard them and started doing it too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what they were doing, but my mom (Angela Belle) didn't.
She thought people were booing me, but (tailback) Dante Hall's mom
told her what they were doing. I like it a lot. It's exciting when
I hear them.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6-1 and 260 pounds, Toombs has brought back memories of
former A&AMP;M running back George Woodard, who weighed 280 pounds and
rushed for 2,864 yards in his first three seasons before an injury
and his expanding weight got the best of him. Toombs weighed 270
when he arrived on campus two months ago, but the A&AMP;M coaches
believe Toombs can keep his weight under control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Ja'Mar has a lot of self-discipline,'' said A&AMP;M
offensive coordinator Steve Kragthorpe. ``When you point something
out to him, he'll take care of it. He has lost 10 pounds since he
got here. I wish I could have lost 10 pounds since Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't compare Ja'Mar to Woodard, because I really don't
know anything about Woodard. I think I was 10 when he started
playing here.''
</P>
<P>
   Toombs also never had heard of Woodard before arriving at A&AMP;M,
and he has no intentions of following in Woodard's footsteps by
letting his weight get out of hand. Toombs said he has too many
reasons to work hard to succeed, including his 6-month-old son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I named him Christopher after my brother,'' Toombs said. ``He
gives me a lot of inspiration. He'll be here with his mom and my
mom for the Texas Tech game (Oct. 24). If I have a good game that
day, I plan on bringing him to the press room when it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Toombs probably would not have been at any press-room gatherings
this season if not for the academic problems that caused A&AMP;M senior
fullback Tiki Hardeman to lose his eligibility two games into the
season. The Aggies already had lost fullback Marc Broyles for the
season because of an illness that affects his vision, so Toombs was
forced into action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiki and I became friends, and he taught me a lot,'' Toombs
said. ``I was hoping Tiki wouldn't be suspended. When it happened,
he told me I couldn't be a freshman anymore. I had to step up and
take his place.''
</P>
<P>
   Toombs also thinks he is stepping up and doing what his brother
always wanted him to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the things that keeps me focused,'' Toombs said.
``Not only do I want to do things right for my brother, but I also
want to set a good example for my son. I want him to be able to
have all the things a young boy should have.''
</P>
<P>
   Toombs' college career is just beginning, but he has specific
goals beyond his days at A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my brother that one day I would make it to the pros,''
Toombs said. ``He was a real good barber and used to cut my hair. I
always told him I would open up a barbershop for him, and I still
plan to do it. If I do make it to the pros, I am going to open a
chain of barbershops and put his name on them.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was being recruited as one of the top prospects in the
nation, Toombs was told by coaches in other states that his best
chance of making it to the NFL was to play football outside of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida State and Ohio State were hammering him,'' said Texas
A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum. ``They were telling him you have to leave
(Texas) to play in big games. But he stayed here for his mom and
his family, and his mom couldn't have been prouder watching him
have a big game against Nebraska.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M had almost 100 recruits at the Nebraska game, and all of
them saw a true freshman help lead the Aggies to an upset victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``That speaks way more than anything I can do,'' Slocum said.
``I can go into homes and do what I do, but seeing Ja'Mar out there
after turning down Florida State and Ohio State says more than
anything I can tell those kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Toombs said he hopes he can convince other Texas blue-chippers
to stay home to play college football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I could be the poster boy for what can happen if you
stay in Texas,'' Toombs said. ``I think kids can look at me now and
see you can stay in Texas and still win the big games against the
top teams. If some stay in the state because I do well, it would
make me feel real good. I know what it would mean for their
families being able to see their sons play.''
</P>
<P>
   Toombs wishes his brother were around to see him play, but
Toombs said he never will forget the things Christopher told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said I could become something special if I worked hard and
did the right things,'' Toombs said. ``I always told him I would.
I'm just trying to do all the things he wanted me to do.''

 &HT;    With early detection, breast cancer can be beaten
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Evelyn Gresham knows what it's like to come to terms
with the words ``You have breast cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past year, she's lived through the diagnosis, scares,
fear, surgeries and drugs, and now she helps others facing the same
questions and uncertainties through the volunteer, nonprofit group
Bosom Buddies of Georgia Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``One weekend, I went to visit a woman who, when she found out
(about her cancer), she bought a casket, she found a cemetery plot
and she just kept crying,'' said Gresham, 41. ``You lose it. You
ask yourself, `Why is this happening to me?' But you need to talk
to women who are surviving breast cancer. They've got the
information. They've got the experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Women's awareness of breast cancer and the need for early
detection were raised when WSB-TV anchor Monica Kaufman disclosed
last week that a small tumor was detected in her left breast. The
popular 51-year-old newswoman underwent a lumpectomy, surgical
removal of the cancerous lump, Friday at Emory University Hospital.
She is reported to be recovering in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman's cancer is said to be intraductal carcinoma, an early
form of the disease that is confined to milk glands and responds
well to treatment. But her early diagnosis was because of a simple
test every woman older than 40 should get annually: a mammogram, or
breast X-ray, to screen for cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Early detection of breast cancer, which claims the lives of
43,500 American women a year, is regarded as the best bet for
beating it. The five-year survival rate for breast cancer that has
not spread beyond the breast has improved from 72 percent in the
1940s to 95 percent today, according to the American Cancer
Society.
</P>
<P>
   And that is the message that Kaufman's condition is helping
women to hear, health officials say. Emory's Breast Imaging Center
received 400 calls Friday about mammogram appointments, about 100
more calls than usual, after word of Kaufman's cancer was reported
on TV broadcasts and in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ``The
staff was a little bit overwhelmed by the rush of phone calls,''
said Susan Stewart, spokeswoman for the Emory Winship Cancer
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman's breast cancer diagnosis happened to come during
October, which for the past decade has been Breast Cancer Awareness
Month. Health organizations and hospitals typically remind women
during the month about the importance of annual mammograms as well
as sponsor numerous informational and entertainment events.
</P>
<P>
   Mammograms and self-breast exams are credited for the increase
in early detection, and improved survival rates. Abnormalities most
often appear on the X-ray images of the breast before they can be
felt or seen by a woman or her doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mammograms are wonderful, they really are,'' said Dr. William
Wood, Emory University's chairman of the department of surgery.
``The message really has gotten out about the need to get them
taken annually. However, it's not rare to see someone who's gone
three or four years without getting a mammogram.''
</P>
<P>
   Lack of money and access to health facilities are the main
reasons women do not receive the recommended annual exam, doctors
say. Many hospitals and clinics are offering breast screenings at a
discount this month.
</P>
<P>
   While the chance of developing breast cancer does increase with
age and a family history of it, women must remember that gender is
the biggest risk factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being female, that's it,'' said Lynn Dillard, health
specialist with the American Cancer Society's national office in
Atlanta. ``All women are at risk for getting breast cancer. That's
the No. 1 factor.'' (Men can develop breast cancer, but rarely.
It's diagnosed in about 1 percent of men, and about 400 die of the
disease each year.)
</P>
<P>
   And should the news from a mammogram or biopsy be bad, Bosom
Buddies' Gresham, who underwent a mastectomy with immediate
reconstruction, has this one-word recommendation: research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do your research. Don't take the first diagnosis,'' says
Gresham, a DeKalb County, Ga. employee and single parent of three
children. ``Get a second opinion. And if you don't feel comfortable
with your doctor, get another one. That's what I did.'' Gresham
says she feels ``great'' after her surgery a year ago, with enough
energy to walk four miles several times a week.
</P>
<P>
   While heart disease is the leading cause of death among American
women, it doesn't come close in evoking the fear and stigma that
breast cancer does, health educators and advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of women are still really reluctant to get screening and
to get a mammogram,'' said Vicki Castleberry, 67, president of
Bosom Buddies, a group she founded in 1983, three years after
undergoing a radical mastectomy.
</P>
<P>
   The sessions started with a few women meeting in Castleberry's
Tucker home and have blossomed today to 32 separate groups
throughout Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women sometimes say, `Oh, I don't need a support group. I can
do this on my own,''' said Castleberry. ``But what I tell them is,
`You may not need it but maybe you can come out and help someone
else go through this,' and once they do that, they always come
back.''

YOUNG OFFENDER FACES DEATH, AND STATE IS URGED TO HALT IT  
(JT)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Virginia plans on Wednesday to execute a man who
was 17 when he fatally shot a woman in 1989, in a case that has
drawn wide criticism of the use of capital punishment for juvenile
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   The execution of the man, Dwayne Allen Wright, would be the 12th
of a juvenile offender in the United States since 1985, and the
first in Virginia since the death penalty was reinstated there in
1976. Twenty-four states permit execution of offenders under 18 at
the time of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Wright's case has drawn requests for clemency from the president
of the American Bar Association, Philip Anderson; the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and Amnesty
International. They say that Wright, of Washington, was brain
damaged at birth, was reared by a mother with mental illnesses and
was committed to a mental hospital himself when he was 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most troubling case for execution I have seen in
my entire life,'' said Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of
Columbia's delegate in the House. ``If this sentence is carried
out, it will prove that our country has lost its way in criminal
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. James S. Gilmore III of Virginia has a request on his desk
from Wright's lawyers to commute the sentence to life in prison or
to grant a 60-day reprieve so that a more formal clemency request
may be filed.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Wright filed a stay of execution Tuesday with the
U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   But the office of the Virginia attorney general filed a motion
opposing the defense request. ``The jury considered his age as well
as mental state when it sentenced him to death,'' said David
Botkins, a spokesman for the attorney general, Mark Earley.
``Numerous mental health experts have determined Wright is not
brain damaged, and the U.S. Supreme Court has held that someone
like Wright, who committed a capital murder at 17, may be executed.
The predatory killing of Saba Tekle left three children motherless
and was one of three murders by Dwayne Wright within a five-day
period.''
</P>
<P>
   In four days in October 1989, Wright, then living in Washington,
shot to death Saba Tekle, a 34-year-old mother of three, in
Virginia; a 19-year-old man in Maryland in an attempted robbery,
and a 31-year-old man in Washington in an argument. Wright pleaded
guilty to charges in Maryland and received two life sentences. A
murder charge was dismissed in Washington. But the death penalty
was imposed in Virginia for the Tekle killing.
</P>
<P>
   Wright spotted Ms. Tekle on the highway and followed her from
Washington to her apartment in Annandale, Va. The police in
Fairfax, Va., said he tried to sexually assault her. When she tried
to flee, Wright shot her and stole her car.
</P>
<P>
   Wright's lawyers said he was stopped for driving a stolen car.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, said Robert E. Lee, one of his lawyers,
Wright told the police about the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Lila Young, a spokeswoman for Gilmore, said the letter from
Wright's lawyers describing his troubled childhood and more
material filed Tuesday would be reviewed by the governor and
governor's counsel.

 &HT;    Falcons sparked by turnovers
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's not a Falcon player or coach who wasn't
ecstatic Sunday night when reserve defensive end Antonio Edwards
stripped the ball from Giants quarterback Danny Kanell, plucked it
out of mid-air and returned it 2 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Turnovers may be the single biggest key to success in the NFL,
and the Falcons, who are 4-1 for just the third time in the 33-year
history of the franchise, are doing quite well in this category.
</P>
<P>
   They're sixth in the NFL in takeaways with 13, and tied for
eighth with a plus-four turnover ratio. They're plus six in their
wins, and minus-two in their loss.
</P>
<P>
   Strong safety William White returned a fumble 18 yards for a TD
in the 51-23 win over Carolina on Oct. 4, making this the first
time since 1991 Atlanta has scored off turnovers in consecutive
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   That year, the Falcons went 10-6, made the playoffs and beat the
Saints 27-20 in a wild-card game before losing 24-7 at Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings (5-0) lead the NFL with a plus-nine ratio. This
Sunday's opponent, the Saints (3-2), are tied for second in the NFL
with a plus-seven ratio and haven't lost a fumble yet.
</P>
<P>
   The worst team in the NFL, the Redskins (0-6), are tied for last
in the NFL with a minus-13 ratio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know if we protect the football ... we have an excellent
chance to win,'' coach Dan Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   Jamal Anderson's fumble on the first play of Sunday night's game
set up a New York field goal, the Giants' only lead of the game.
The Falcons came right back to score a touchdown, though. It hasn't
always been this way.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Falcons were minus-18 in turnovers, and finished
3-13. They got just six interceptions all season (last in the NFL),
and threw 30. Last year, Atlanta improved to plus-four, with 28
takeaways, getting 18 interceptions (sixth in the NFL) and throwing
11.
</P>
<P>
   This season the Falcons have just four interceptions, three by
cornerback Ray Buchanan and one by White, but they've scooped up
nine fumbles, seven in the past two games. The Falcons worked extra
in training camp on stripping the ball, like reserve linebacker
Keith Brooking did Sunday night when he robbed Giant tight end
Howard Cross, and are on a pace to get 42 this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have thrown five interceptions and lost four
fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who has fumbled just nine times in 806 career
``touches,'' said that when the defense gets a turnover, the
emotional lift puts pressure on the offense. But it's a good kind
of pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a double-edged sword because they expect us to
score. But we welcome that,'' he said. ``It's unbelievable man.
We're thrilled. We've gotten to where we're anticipating a fumble
or a pick.''

 &HT;    Jones' S.D. term likely to be short
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ His second incarnation as an NFL head coach figures to
be a short-term experience, but June Jones intends to treat his
interim tenure with the San Diego Chargers as if he is there for
the long-haul and not just the final 10 games of this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can speculate about what will happen here at the end of
the year,'' Jones said Tuesday evening, a few hours after
succeeding the deposed Kevin Gilbride as coach. ``I know we have to
get our offense going and we have to win games. If we can do those
things, then I think I'll get some consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the timing of Gilbride's dismissal came as a surprise. It
has long been rumored he could be gone by midseason if the Chargers
did not respond to him, and replaced by the more popular Jones. The
decision to fire Gilbride, whose contract has three more years to
run, actually came Monday night after club officials huddled twice
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbride was 6-16 in his first stint as a head coach. Beyond his
failures on the field, he alienated players and team management and
constantly was at odds with the media.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Bobby Beathard, who hired Gilbride to replace
Bobby Ross, said the coach burned too many bridges and the team
lacked direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't a sudden or impulsive thing,'' Beathard said.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie quarterback Ryan Leaf argued vociferously on the sideline
with Gilbride after he was removed from Sunday's loss at Oakland,
and players said the exchange between the two men grew ugly.
Ironically, a shouting match with quarterback Jeff George on Sept.
22, 1996, contributed to Jones' demise with the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   In his three seasons here, Jones was 19-30. His 9-7 team in '95
was one of just five Falcons clubs to qualify for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 45, acknowledged his tenure with the Falcons was ``a
learning experience,'' but noted he doesn't intend to dramatically
alter his approach to handling players. ``You just don't change who
you are and what you believe in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Had Gilbride remained, Leaf would have been replaced by veteran
Craig Whelihan for the upcoming game against Philadelphia. Jones
said he will announce the starter today but he is likely to stick
with the struggling Leaf.
</P>
<P>
   Chargers owner Alex Spanos, who has the NFL's highest payroll
but just a 2-4 record to show for it, almost certainly will seek a
high-profile coach like George Seifert or Mike Holmgren for 1999.
Seifert, who currently works for CBS, debunked rumors he had been
approached Tuesday about taking over the Chargers.

 &HT;    AL Notebook: Spotlight on Justice's words
 &HT;    By I. J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Before the most important game of the season, the
Indians weren't talking about baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the focus continued to be on David Justice and his
impromptu press conference Monday when he said he did not ask out
of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   But as has been the case in his career for the former Brave,
Justice's mouth got him in more trouble. When asked about the fans
in New York, he said, ``They can't get any rougher on us unless
they show up with Uzis.''
</P>
<P>
   Uzis? Nothing like firing up the other club's fans when your
team needs a victory just to keep the series alive.
</P>
<P>
   Justice was back in the lineup Tuesday, but as the designated
hitter and not in left field. Asked if putting Justice in the DH
spot was for his own personal safety, Indians manager Mike Hargrove
laughed and said, ``No, the decision was made because Brian Giles'
ankle feels good tonight. I read what he said about the fans of New
York and all he was saying is the fans are very as I said
vociferous. To me he was trying to be funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny? Try telling that to a hardened Yankee fan from the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hargrove also defended Justice and his press
conference where he criticized ESPN's Peter Gammons for insinuating
that he begged out of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell you this thing completely blind-sided me,'' Hargrove
said. ``If I known that this was going to happen, I would have been
here (Monday) to field questions. At no time did he beg out of the
lineup, did he ask to be taken out of the lineup, did he intimate
to me in any shape, or fashion that he did not want to play. I
think this is a mountain out of a molehill. I called David (Monday
night) when I got back from dinner and we sat down for an hour and
talked about this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The reception for Knobby
</P>
<P>
   Everyone was wondering what type of reception Yankees second
baseman Chuck Knoblauch would get Tuesday night. The last time
Knoblauch was here he was booed viciously by his own fans for his
mental miscue in Game 2 which helped lead to a loss. But on this
night when he was introduced before the game and his pitcher was
put in center field, they cheered him loudly . Before the game,
Knoblauch said: ``They pay their money, they can do whatever they
want. Like I said, I'm concentrating on the game only and not
anything that takes place outside the line.'' Added teammate David
Wells, ``If they're going to boo us, they might as well boo every
one of us because we're all a team. So we win together and lose
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the horn
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot of talk whether the Yankees will pitch Andy
Pettitte in a Game 7 if there is one. There is also talk of whether
Pettitte will be dropped from the rotation if the team gets to the
World Series. Pettitte was ripped hard in Game 3 and there is a
question of his mental makeup, ... But he said, ``I ain't scared,
I've never been scared and I'm still not scared.'' ... Yankees
manager Joe Torre decided to go with rookie Ricky Ledee in left
field Tuesday. Both Chad Curtis and Shane Spencer have struggled in
the series, with just one hit in 14 at-bats between them. ... It
has been a great series for Indians shortstop Omar Vizquel, who
went into Game 6 with 10 hits in 20 at-bats. The record for a
six-game ALCS is .458 by Kenny Lofton for the Indians in 1995.

 &HT;    'Great theater' an apt description of NLCS drama
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was, Wally Joyner decided, possibly ''the best game
I've ever participated in...Like a chess match played with live
people.'' What felt ''unbelievable'' to Ryan Klesko was simply
indescribable to Bobby Cox. Tony Gwynn's hyperbole grew like the
evening's drama itself: ''A good game...a very good game...great
theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Great theater of the wonderfully absurd. Indeed, what began in
the late-afternoon southern California sunlight ended well beyond
nightfall with the most riveting yet unlikely of classic
confrontations. The best hitter of his era facing the best pitcher
of the era. Gwynn in the batter's box and Greg Maddux in _ good
grief! _ relief? The decade's dominant starter, a closer? Yes.
</P>
<P>
   When Maddux, making his first relief appearance since 1987, got
Gwynn to ground out and finally end Monday's melodrama, it was far
more than Mad Dog's first professional save. It concluded Atlanta's
astounding 7-6 victory over the Padres in Game 5 of the National
League Championship Series, and guaranteed what once seemed an even
more preposterous notion: Game 6, today at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   When the NLCS resumes at 4:20 p.m., the Braves will be halfway
home to a big-league miracle. No team in baseball history has ever
overcome a 3-0 deficit to win a postseason series. But after two
late-inning, life-preserving rallies in San Diego _ Sunday's
gutwrenching, Monday's astonishing _ Tom Glavine and the Braves can
even the series today.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine, who lost Game 2 3-0 to Kevin Brown, will oppose
Sterling Hitchcock, the Game 3 winner. If there is a Game 7
Thursday, Brown, who threw 41 pitches Monday in a rare relief
appearance, will try to oust Atlanta for the second straight year
and deny the Braves their fifth World Series appearance in seven
seasons. And another chunk of baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the stuff that's happened this year, all the home runs and
everything, don't count the Braves out,'' said Klesko, who, after
San Diego took a 3-0 lead in the series, said, ''You've got to take
it as the seventh game of the World Series, four games in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   After Game 5, Klesko amended that: ''Two Game 7's down, two to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   In the quiet of the manager's office in the visitors clubhouse
after Monday's comeback, Cox said, ''The way I was approaching it
with everybody, we've got a one-game series here. Then, we go to
Atlanta with a two-game series. You've got to pick 'em off one at a
time.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still in the driver's seat,'' said Greg Vaughn, the
Padres' 50-homer, 119-RBI left fielder who'd been out with a
strained quadriceps since the fifth inning of Game 1 until he
pinch-hit against Maddux Monday, and struck out. Vaughn will likely
start today. But if San Diego is still in the driver's seat, the
Padres might heed that warning on the driver's side window: Objects
are closer than they appear.
</P>
<P>
   All this after a Game 5 that took more turns than Lombardi
Street in San Francisco, and produced perhaps the most unlikely
postseason homer since Bucky Dent cleared Fenway's Green Monster
and broke Boston's heart in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess tonight was my night,'' Tucker said after striking his
second homer of the postseason, first in NLCS play. Not that Tucker
hadn't hit Brown in the past. He was 6-for-11 (.545) lifetime,
2-for-2 with a walk this season. Tucker, however, finished the
season in a horrible slump (29-for-156, .186), and had just one
homer in the season's last seven weeks and 10 RBIs after the
All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Although Tucker went 0-for-3 (two strikeouts) against Brown in
Game 2, he felt some confidence when facing Brown in Game 5. A
sense of familiarity with the guy who'd been the dominant pitcher
this postseason. ''After facing him two, three times this year and
last year,'' said Tucker, ''you pretty much have an idea of what
he's going to throw.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that that helped in Game 2, when Brown struck out 11. Not
that it helped in the seventh inning, when he came on with one on
and none out and quickly retired three straight. Bochy went with
Brown with a 4-2 lead (courtesy of John Vander Wal's two-run homer
off John Smoltz in the sixth), hoping to put away Atlanta for good.
The gamble was bold, and backfired.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people probably felt it was in the bag because
Brownie was in,'' said Gwynn. But Bochy made no Brownie points
Monday. Klesko drew a leadoff walk in the eighth in a terrific
at-bat, working the count full, fouling off two pitches, then
taking a pitch that was just off the inside corner for ball four.
When shortstop Chris Gomez went into the hole and down on the
ground to backhand Javy Lopez's smash, Klesko hustled and slid into
second just ahead of Gomez's throw.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones fouled out, but then Tucker worked the count to
3-1, hit a grounder foul just wide of first, then lasered an 89 MPH
split-finger fastball over the right field wall. It was just the
ninth homer allowed by Brown in 251 regular-season and post-season
innings.
</P>
<P>
   And Atlanta wasn't done. Good thing. Rookie reliever John
Rocker, in his first at-bat, walked on four pitches, then scored
from first on Tony Graffanino's double to left-center. Rocker ran
even harder than he does while racing in from the bullpen, slid
home and upended catcher Carlos Hernandez. When the relay sailed by
and out of play, Graffanino scored, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves needed all of that when ex-Brave Greg Myers hit a
two-run pinch-homer off Kerry Ligtenberg in the ninth. Then Maddux
left an unlikely place _ the bullpen _ for an even stranger role as
a closer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt like a fish out of water down there,'' Maddux said of
his time in the pen. ''I didn't know what to do, how to act, what
to say. I don't know the bullpen lingo the way they do.''
</P>
<P>
   But he knew how to close the deal. After fanning Vaughn and
getting Quilvio Veras to ground out, Maddux walked Steve Finley.
Then came Gwynn, a career .435 hitter against Maddux who has more
hits (35) off the right-hander than off any other pitcher. Gwynn
was 0-for-2 with a walk against Maddux in Game 3. This time, Maddux
got Gwynn to ground out to Andres Galarraga to force a Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   And as Glavine said, ''We feel if anyone can come back from 3-0,
we can.''

 &HT;    Reno prepares to name Rudolph; couple confirms powder sale
 &HT;    By Kathy Scruggs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A Nashville man who told federal agents he sold
Birmingham bombing suspect Eric Robert Rudolph the smokeless powder
allegedly used in the Centennial Olympic Park bomb said he and his
wife were subpoenaed to appear before a federal grand jury here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a press conference has tentatively been scheduled for
today in Washington, when U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno is
expected to announce that Rudolph has been charged in three Atlanta
bombings, officials with the Southeast Bomb Task Force said Monday.
A second press conference is scheduled in Atlanta Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   David Mosley, a Nashville businessman who started a sideline
company selling ammunition and other supplies to gun enthusiasts
and hunters in 1993, said he has been told that his evidence is
among the strongest linking Rudolph to the July 1996 park blast
that killed an Albany woman and injured 111 people.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law enforcement officials would not publicly confirm
that Mosley was subpoenaed or that a grand jury is hearing
testimony in the Atlanta bombing cases, citing grand jury secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley said he conducted transactions with a man who used the
name Bob Randolph at three gun shows. At the first, in Nashville in
March 1994, ``Randolph'' paid $400 in cash for 8 pounds of 5
Accurate Arms brand smokeless powder and 8 pounds of 9 Accurate
Arms powder, Mosley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randolph'' also ordered ``a bunch of lead bullets'' and 32
pounds of Accurate Arms 7 smokeless powder, which he picked up two
weeks later at a gun show in Sparta, Tenn., Mosley said.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley's wife, who was at the Sparta show, later identified
``Randolph'' as Eric Rudolph when federal agents presented a photo
lineup, Mosley said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Sparta show, the man bought 20,000 lead bullets for .45
caliber, .38 caliber, and 9mm handguns and 10,000 rounds of .223
caliber ammunition used in an AR-15, a semi-automatic rifle. A
federal wanted poster for Rudolph says he owns and is probably
armed with an AR-15.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley, who has not been charged with a crime, said he
remembered ``Randolph'' mostly from the Sparta show because the
name he gave was the same last name as an Olympian shooter. Mosley
said the orders were not uncommonly large for gun enthusiasts who
reload bullets for hunting and target practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``And believe it or not, he wrote a check to me for $622 using
the name Bob Randolph,'' he said. ``It was the biggest sale I had
ever made. I wrote him a receipt.'' Federal agents have said
Rudolph didn't trust or use banks.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, at a Knoxville gun show, Rudolph bought about
$30 worth of boxed ammunition, Mosley said.
</P>
<P>
   Cherokee County, N.C., Sheriff Jack Thompson said as early as
January that Rudolph sometimes used the name Bob Randolph.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph remains a fugitive in western North Carolina where about
80 federal and state law enforcement agents are looking for him. He
is charged in the Jan. 29 bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic
that killed an off-duty police officer and severely injured a
nurse, and agents have said they want to question him in the
Atlanta bombings.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1996, three bombs of galvanized steel pipes packed with
smokeless powder and taped together with concrete flooring nails
were left under a bench in Centennial Olympic Park. Not all of them
ignited properly, investigators have said.
</P>
<P>
   Later bombs, in January 1997 at a Sandy Springs abortion clinic,
in February 1997 at a gay club on Piedmont Road and this January at
the Birmingham clinic, were dynamite, federal agents have said.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley said investigators told him a powder canister identical
to the ones Rudolph bought from him was found during a search of
some of his belongings found in North Carolina. A federal lab has
confirmed that the powder Rudolph bought from Mosley was consistent
with the powder used in the park bomb, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   According to a task force document, the park bomb was packed
with 7 or 9 Accurate Arms powder, which is manufactured in
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley said that's an amateur bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why he used that,'' Mosley said. ``There's not
enough energy. It won't pack right. There's not enough nitro in it
to make a real big bang. Those are slow-burning pistol powders. I
don't think he knew what he was doing. Black powder would have made
a huge hole in the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosley told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in a recent
interview in Nashville that he and his wife were stunned to see
Rudolph's picture flash across their television screen after the
Birmingham bombing. Rudolph was sought for questioning within hours
of that blast outside the abortion clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time she saw it on TV, my wife remembered him,''
Mosley said. ``She said, 'That's the guy we sold the powder to.' At
the time I didn't worry about it. For all I knew, he was just using
it for reloading.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosley said it wasn't until he told a customer about the sales
that he was questioned by agents. Mosley said he didn't know at the
time his customer was also an FBI agent.
</P>
<P>
   Agents ``have questioned me three or four times and they've
questioned my wife twice,'' Mosley said. Mosley declined to give
his wife's name because, he said, she is ill.

 &HT;    Schools unaware served beef was recalled
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two local school systems that served beef patties
linked to possible salmonella contamination weren't aware the
patties had been recalled until Monday, although the recall went
into effect last week.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton and Rockdale school cafeterias served beef patties
included in a nationwide recall of 2 million pounds of beef,
poultry and pork products processed at Zartic Inc.'s plant in
Cedartown.
</P>
<P>
   Rockdale served 120 pounds of the suspect hamburgers and
cheeseburgers at lunch Monday; at 2 p.m. school officials learned
of the recall.
</P>
<P>
   Despite no reports of salmonella-related illness, whose symptoms
include diarrhea and fever, officials from both school systems are
upset that they weren't notified earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to call Zartic. They didn't call me,'' said Wendy
McNamee, Clayton's director of food nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   But Zartic isn't responsible for notifying schools, because it
doesn't deal with institutions that consume its products. Zartic
ships to distributors.
</P>
<P>
   Zartic spent Thursday identifying the affected product batches.
All day Friday, the eight fax machines in Zartic's corporate
offices hummed with detailed instructions to 300 distributors in 34
states. Zartic called its clients Monday morning to confirm
notification.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture is investigating the source
of the contamination. Zartic has indefinitely suspended operations
on the contaminated production lines.
</P>
<P>
   Burgers will return to Rockdale and Clayton's menus, but they'll
be from a different company, school officials said.

OIL-DUMPING CHARGE FOR ROYAL CARIBBEAN  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One month after Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.
pleaded guilty to felony charges in the dumping of oil near Miami
and near San Juan, Puerto Rico, and agreed to pay $9 million in
fines and penalties, one of its ships dumped oil in July, federal
prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
   They plan to present the information to a federal judge in San
Juan on Wednesday at a sentencing hearing for the San Juan
incident.
</P>
<P>
   In June, after Royal Caribbean Cruises pleaded guilty, the
company paid for advertisements in newspapers in Miami and San Juan
in which it said, in part, ``You also have our commitment that we
will do a better job in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   But one of the ships involved in the guilty pleas, the Nordic
Empress, dumped oil in exactly the same way in July, the company
told prosecutors that same month, after the guilty pleas. The July
dumping occurred at an unspecified location.
</P>
<P>
   And in the July incident, just as in the first two cases, from
1990 to 1994, which involved the Nordic Empress and the Sovereign
of the Seas, ships officers lied to investigators and falsified
records to hide their actions.
</P>
<P>
   A Royal Caribbean spokeswoman, Lynn Martenstein, said the best
the company could do was to ``provide the training and have the
systems in place to follow policy, and if they're not followed,
deal with them swiftly and decisively.'' And the two engineers
involved in the July dumping have been dismissed, Ms. Martenstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   Royal, which also operates Celebrity Cruises from Miami, is the
world's second largest line, after Carnival Cruise Lines, also of
Miami.

BANKAMERICA EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE HEDGE FUND LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BankAmerica Corp., the nation's fifth-largest bank, is expected
to announce a big hedge fund loss Wednesday in the latest example
of the dangers posed to financial companies from the risky,
sometimes high-flying investment pools.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts estimate that the loss may be about $100 million,
but others say that BankAmerica's overall exposure to the hedge
fund, D.E. Shaw &AMP; Co., could be as large as $1 billion, taking the
form of either loans or credit lines. It is not clear whether
BankAmerica owned an interest in Shaw, and the legality of
commercial banks holding such stakes is murky.
</P>
<P>
   BankAmerica, which reports third-quarter earnings Wednesday,
declined to comment on its hedge-fund exposure generally or its
relationship with Shaw in particular. And a Shaw spokesman declined
to comment on its relationship with BankAmerica.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, BankAmerica, which recently disclosed large trading
losses in Russia, said it had pretax trading losses around $330
million so far in the third quarter and that it expected its
net-interest income in the quarter to be reduced by $65 million
primarily because of ``one borrower.'' Analysts and others close to
BankAmerica widely believe that borrower to be Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators, investors and members of Congress have become
increasingly concerned about hedge fund losses _ and commercial and
investment banks' involvement with the funds _ since the
near-collapse of a giant fund, Long-Term Capital Management, a few
weeks ago. Regulators contend that Long-Term Capital's brush with
disaster threatened to undermine broader financial systems.
</P>
<P>
   If more big banks are wounded by hedge funds and other lending
losses, there is a strong possibility that commercial and
investment banks will rein in lending and underwriting, thus
slowing American economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think BankAmerica has a credit exposure to D.E. Shaw that
could be substantial,'' said Judah Kraushaar, a banking analyst
with Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. ``Ultimately, if you have a liquidity
crunch, the Federal Reserve may have to take some dramatic action
to make sure that capital markets can continue to function
correctly.''
</P>
<P>
   Hedge funds are unregulated investment pools open only to
wealthy individuals and big institutional investors. The funds'
goal is to outperform market averages by trading stocks, bonds or
other assets, and to weather market downturns better than other
funds.
</P>
<P>
   BankAmerica's hedge fund loss was first reported Tuesday in The
San Francisco Chronicle. In trading Tuesday on the New York Stock
Exchange, BankAmerica's shares rose $1.125, to $53.9375, well below
the 52-week high of $88.4375.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw denies speculation that it is in serious financial trouble,
and Shaw is not a big bond investor, as was Long-Term Capital.
Also, analysts said Shaw was not carrying a huge amount of debt, as
Long-Term Capital did.
</P>
<P>
   ``No Shaw entity has been, or is now, in any form of trouble
financially,'' said Nick Gianakouros, Shaw's vice president. ``Any
reports that we are having financial problems are absolutely,
unequivocally untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, which manages about $1.7 billion in assets, declined to
answer questions about its performance. It has been reported that
the fund has lost 12.6 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   BankAmerica's relationship with Shaw, a New York hedge fund that
uses complex, technical mathematical formulas primarily for stock
investments, was engineered in 1997 by David Coulter, BankAmerica's
former chief executive. Coulter will be serving as president of the
new BankAmerica, which was formed through its recent combination
with Nationsbank Corp. of Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and others familiar with BankAmerica's operations said
the bank lent about $1 billion to a proprietary investment
portfolio managed by Shaw in exchange for 50 percent of the fund's
profits or losses. One bank adviser said that BankAmerica's
involvement with Shaw also included an equity stake. When Coulter
received a bonus of $4.25 million last year on top of a salary of
$987,500, BankAmerica cited the alliance with Shaw as one of the
reasons for the bonus, and Shaw employees were trotted out at an
analysts' conference that BankAmerica held last year.
</P>
<P>
   Banks' interests in relationships with hedge funds go beyond the
profits that can be gained from such investments. They also give
banks insight into the types of trades made by hedge funds _ which
until recently were considered among the savviest of investors _ in
financial markets. This vantage allows banks a first look at where
hedge funds are betting and enables them to use such information to
make similar trades if they seem desirable.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the relationships are risky, as BankAmerica has discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We backed off of BankAmerica a few weeks ago because of
concern about the bank's hedge fund lending,'' said Michael Mayo,
an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. ``It looks like the old
BankAmerica is somewhat weaker than what was expected at the time
of the merger. We wouldn't be surprised to see Nationsbank curtail
some of the riskier activities of the old BankAmerica as it becomes
part of the merged company.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationsbank officials declined to comment on the hedge fund
losses or what impact they might have on Coulter's role in the
combined bank. Coulter, who is a trained mathematician, has been
designated as supervisor of risk-management practices at the new
bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaw is a computer-model-technical-analysis-type approach to
investing,'' said Charles Peabody of Mitchell Securities in New
York. ``If the loss got that big, it might be because human common
sense said the loss could get bigger but the model said it was
OK.''

BISHOPS URGE MORE ADVANCEMENT OF LAYWOMEN IN CHURCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)  (mk) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A committee of the nation's Roman Catholic bishops declared
Tuesday that the church authorities ought to do more to promote
qualified women to positions of lay leadership in the church,
thereby increasing the ranks of those who serve in such jobs as
hospital administrators, school superintendents and even
chancellors of dioceses.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement written by the bishops' Committee on Women in
Society and in the Church, the committee said, ``We emphasize the
need to appoint women to positions that entail substantive
responsibility and influence, so that the church may reap the full
benefit of their talents.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement, titled ``From Words to Deeds,'' also called for a
greater appreciation of women's leadership abilities and asked for
a spirit of collaboration between men and women in the church. But
it did not challenge or even discuss the church's position that the
priesthood is restricted to men.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, by noting those offices that may be held by lay people
within the code of canon law, the statement effectively described
church leadership as something that extends beyond those who are
ordained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We assume that all roles in the church are open to women,
unless stated otherwise by canon law,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   That distinction is crucial, especially since Pope John Paul II
has said the restriction of the priesthood to men is definitive and
closed to discussion. As if to add a new emphasis to his words,
another bishops' committee made public a separate document Tuesday,
intended, it said, ``to assist the faithful in their acceptance of
what the church teaches'' about the priesthood.
</P>
<P>
   That document, written by the Committee on Doctrine and titled
``Ten Frequently Asked Questions About the Reservation of Priestly
Ordination to Men,'' says the male priesthood is a fundamental
element of the faith, received directly from Jesus, who called only
men as his apostles. ``The basis for this teaching is the authority
of Christ himself,'' the document states.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the bishops' conference said it was a
coincidence that the two documents were made public on the same
day.
</P>
<P>
   The statement on women, said Auxiliary Bishop John Dunne,
chairman of the committee that wrote it, ``is saying to the church,
to all of us, `Let's be open to what women can be.'''
</P>
<P>
   Before writing its statement, the committee spent two years
meeting with lay people and priests from around the country, said
Dunne, auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Rockville Center on Long
Island, N.Y. The statement reflects those conversations, saying the
committee recognized that any discussion of women's roles in the
church ``can evoke strong emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heard women speak of their satisfaction when ordained
leaders recognize their gifts and skills and use them to serve the
church's mission,'' the statement said. ``We have also heard women
speak of their hurt and pain when ordained leaders reject or do not
fully use these gifts.''
</P>
<P>
   To promote the appreciation of women's talents and to speed
their appointment to church jobs, the statement offers a number of
suggestions. It also contains, in its conclusion, a ``fundamental
recommendation'' that all Catholics examine their words and actions
to see whether these ``promote progress on women's roles in the
church.'' And it warns against ``harsh rhetoric,'' arrogance and an
unwillingness to listen.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, which is advisory rather than binding on
dioceses, was written to follow up a pastoral message on the role
of women in the church issued by the bishops' conference in 1994.
It also comes at a time when many dioceses are confronted by a
growing shortage of priests, so that fewer ordained men are
available for jobs outside the local parish.
</P>
<P>
   Dunne said he hoped the statement would encourage other bishops
to do more than place a small number of women in leadership
positions. ``Where people have the talents or have the experience,
they ought to have the positions, too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how a diocese might make use of women's leadership
abilities, he said he would ``very humbly'' point to Rockville
Center, where women serve as superintendent of parochial schools
and as editor of the diocesan newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Wallace, a professor of sociology at George Washington
University who has written about women who have been appointed to
administer parishes, praised the committee's statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``My overall impression is that this is the result of these
bishops taking seriously the gifts of women to enhance the work of
the church,'' Wallace said. ``I think the women who are heading
parishes around the country are going to think they have been
applauded.''

HAS ENGLAND LOST ITS IDENTITY? OR JUST ITS CLICHES? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The English, past masters at turning the raised eyebrow
and the cold shoulder on others, are suddenly feeling looked down
upon and left out in their own land.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, the three other regions that make up Britain _
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland _ have been putting in place
new legislatures to deal with parochial affairs no longer
considered the preserve of the British Parliament in London. Some
in England, traditionally the ruling power in the kingdom, are now
thinking that maybe it should have one too.
</P>
<P>
   The country that created the world's lingua franca and was once
the seat of empire, England still accounts for 83 percent of the
British population and 85 percent of the economy, but its history
with the snub means it knows one when it sees one.
</P>
<P>
   The parceling out of authority to the remoter parts of the
United Kingdom has left English traditionalists, a dwindling
species themselves, anxious about a lot more than not having their
own local lawmakers with a taste for tartans and kilts. Steeped in
pastoral images that have little to do with their up-tempo
modern-day lives, some of them are turning the slight into a sulk
that looks more and more like an identity crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Their frontier passions were stirred by Conservative leader
William Hague at the party's annual conference last week at
Bournemouth in Dorset, the county that inspired Thomas Hardy's
fictional Wessex, itself one of the enduringly mythical places for
the English. In his keynote address, Hague gave prominence to a
proposal to establish a separate assembly for England as one of the
steps that the Tories ought to consider to counter the dominance of
the governing Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
   The new legislatures are being organized in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland under Prime Minister Tony Blair's ``devolution''
project of setting up regional authorities for strictly local
matters while the British Parliament keeps its powers over broad
national policy concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In the testy mood that their creation has provoked among people
who track English culture, slights don't go unnoticed. Editing
``The Oxford Book of English Short Stories,'' A.S. Byatt looked
through the index of a collection of essays on British culture and
reported that she found 55 page references to the Scots, 28 to the
Irish, 27 to the Welsh, 20 to Caribbean societies and only 3 to the
English. What's more, all three were derogatory.
</P>
<P>
   During almost three centuries of union, the Irish, the Scots and
the Welsh kept their distinct national personalities alive and have
a ready supply of symbols to light patriotic fires. The English, by
contrast, may have let their singular identity become extinguished
within Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Celtic fringe has myths, songs, food, dress and
verse that speak to a robust sense of nationhood. The English, in
need of talismans to raise the blood, find themselves stuck with
the same old stereotypes: stiff upper lip, tepid ale, cool heads,
cricket greens, tweed plus fours and the dead-fish handshake.
</P>
<P>
   Counseled to portray themselves as British instead of English,
the traditionalists are now caught up in flag-waving nationalism, a
sentiment that was long forbidden as insensitive, lacking in
decorum and, well, un-English.
</P>
<P>
   The keenest sense of nationalism the English feel is not to
their nation, but to their land, and not to the land they inhabit
today but to some Arcadian version of it. ``It is not the country
in which the English actually live,'' writes Jeremy Paxman in a new
book, ``but the place they imagine themselves living in. The
English have become exiles from their own country.''
</P>
<P>
   Paxman recalls in ``The English'' that his subjects once had a
sure sense of who they were. ``They were polite, unexcitable,
reserved and had hot water bottles instead of a sex life,'' he
writes. ``How they reproduced was one of the mysteries of the
Western world.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to define their country, Englishmen become anecdotal and
sentimental. Unable to settle on an absolute virtue, they end up
cataloging England's charms.
</P>
<P>
   John Betjeman's list included oil-lit churches, modest village
inns, arguments about cow parsley on the altar, and leaning on
gates and looking across fields.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, in a much lampooned broadcast for St. George's Day, the
English national day, Prime Minister John Major said that England
for him was ``long shadows on county grounds, warm beer, invincible
green suburbs, dog lovers and pools fillers and _ as George Orwell
said _ old maids cycling to Holy Communion through the morning
mist.''
</P>
<P>
   Products of an island culture and tempered by the Reformation,
the English have liked to think they stood for a belief in
individual liberty, respect for eccentricity, a bloody-minded
devotion to privacy and, above all, a sense of honor.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for them, the best-known expression of English
nationalism these days is the behavior of its soccer fans, who are
notorious abroad for drunkenly rampaging through town centers,
tearing up stadiums and beating up opposing teams' fans.
Significantly, the war paint they cover their faces with no longer
form the Union Jack of Britain but the red and white cross of St.
George that stands for England.
</P>
<P>
   An Englishman today is just as apt to have a tattoo on his arms
and hardware on his face as a bowler hat on his head. The country's
most famous diplomats are not the ones at global conferences in
striped pants; they're the ones bounding onto stages in foreign
cities in platform heels and miniskirts.
</P>
<P>
   For all its reputation for snobbery and exclusiveness, however,
England has been the most welcoming part of Britain to immigrants
and has a more ethnically diverse culture than any of the other
parts of the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle for the English soul has illuminated the letters
pages of The Sunday Times of London, with some writers offering new
lists of resonant symbols and others frowning on the whole
exercise. ``The whole point about being English is that we do not
care what anybody else thinks of us, `` argued Diane Markwell of
Devizes, in Wiltshire.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bradley of South Brent in Devon sought to have the last
word. ``Anyway, all this English navel-gazing is a metropolitan
media obsession,'' he wrote. ``Nobody down here has the slightest
doubt about who we are or even bothers to think about it.''

   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ For nearly a century, the U.S. military
has used the jungle terrain surrounding the Panama Canal as a
testing ground for explosives and chemical weapons. Now, a little
more than a year before those ranges must be handed back to Panama,
Washington is balking at cleaning up some of the most hazardous of
the ordnance its troops are leaving behind.
</P>
<P>
   The deadly debris consists mostly of bombs and other unexploded
munitions that for decades were tested at three ranges near the
west bank of the canal. But the dangerous materials either tested
or stored here also include lethal nerve gases, mustard and
phosgene gases dating back to World War II, biological agents and,
for a short time earlier this decade, depleted uranium projectiles.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which engineered Panama's secession from
Colombia in 1903 in order to build the canal, is required to give
up all its military bases here by Dec. 31, 1999. With that deadline
fast approaching, though, Washington and Panama are locked in an
apparently intractable dispute over to what extent the United
States must clean up its mess.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was supposed to have been settled by the Panama Canal
Treaties, which were signed in 1977 and require the United States
to pay for any environmental cleanup. But faced with a task more
complicated and expensive than anticipated, U.S. military officials
now contend that the treaties in fact exempt them from carrying out
the comprehensive cleanup Panama demands.
</P>
<P>
   The treaties oblige the United States ``to take all measures to
insure insofar as may be practicable that every hazard to human
life, health and safety is removed'' from all areas being returned
to Panama. The treaties also require the United States to ``gather
and provide information concerning environmental hazards caused by
its activities in Panama'' and to ``provide compensation for
irremediable environmental damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Panamanian officials say that since 1979, when formal
sovereignty over the former Canal Zone was transferred from the
United States to Panama, at least 21 people have been killed by
U.S. ordnance left on the ranges. The Pentagon contests that
figure, saying its records indicate only seven people, all of them
scrap dealers digging for metal in off-limits areas, have died.
</P>
<P>
   W. Lewis Amselem, the U.S. co-chairman of a joint working group
set up to deal with range issues, acknowledged in September that
``a small part of the reverted areas will not be available for
unrestricted use.'' That land may amount to perhaps as much as
7,500 acres, or 2 percent of the territory being handed over. But
he and other U.S. officials argue that every ``practicable'' step
to restore the ranges is already being taken and say they simply
cannot do what Panama wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is not time and it is not money,'' Col. David Hunt,
the chief treaty implementation officer for the U.S. Southern
Command said in an interview in Panama. ``The issue is the
technology available to do the job safely while protecting the
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Panama disputes that interpretation, pointing to successful
environmental restoration efforts in other parts of the world,
including the United States itself. The cleanup operation here may
be proving more costly and time-consuming than initially expected,
Panamanian officials maintain, but that does not exempt Washington
from its treaty obligations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the only criterion that should prevail is the
technical feasibility of a cleanup,'' said Jorge Ritter, who is
both minister of foreign affairs and minister of canal affairs in
the Panamanian government, in an interview. ``There should not be
an economic limitation for the United States to clean up so small
an area in relation to those it has used on its own territory and
elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Panama also complains of what it describes as the unwillingness
of U.S. officials to provide information on what types of tests
were conducted at what sites and on what dates. That information is
needed, they say, not only to assure that the cleanup is
comprehensive but also to dispel Panamanian suspicions that
defoliants like Agent Orange were also secretly tested here in the
1960s before their use in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   To Pentagon planners, the extensive U.S. military presence here
and Panama's tropical climate made the Canal Zone and its environs
an ideal testing ground for all sorts of conventional, chemical and
even biological weapons. The United States still operates a
Tropical Test Center here and as recently as 1993 conducted
experiments with the deadly herbicides tebuthiuron, glyphosate and
hexazinone to determine their efficiency in coca eradication in
antidrug efforts in South America.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been telling us they will be making information
available for as long as I can remember,'' said Rodrigo Noriega, a
Panamanian Foreign Ministry official. ``I asked for a precise list
of sites early in 1997, but we still have not been given meaningful
information regarding chemical and other testing activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Panama's concerns about the ordnance problem are shared by Rick
Stauber, once an instructor at the Army's bomb disposal school, who
initially was contracted by the U.S. military to assess the extent
of the damage. But Stauber later became a consultant to the
Panamanian government after, he said in a recent interview, the
Pentagon pressed him to limit the scope of his investigation and
then rejected his findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I did my investigation and developed my report, I was
finding things that were, to say the least, a little disturbing,''
Stauber said. ``The problem was that the recipient of the report
was not eager to see what I was uncovering. There were a lot more
problems than they wanted to admit to and I opened a can of
worms.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials deny Stauber's contention that ``a lot of
information in my report was changed and set in a biased
situation'' so it would conform to their own pre-established
conclusions. But they acknowledge that it has been, as a senior
U.S. official put it, ``painfully slow and frustrating getting
cooperation'' from U.S. military authorities, whose interest in
Panama seems to be waning as the date of their withdrawal
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is further complicated by the fact that some
chemical weapons tests and exercises took place outside the Canal
Zone, most notably in four major installations the Panamanian
government made available during World War II. Information about
those areas, which were returned to Panama after the war, is
especially scarce.
</P>
<P>
   Panama has never had a registry of the chemical tests conducted
on its territory, Ritter said, ``so we need to be clearly informed
by the United States about the testing of chemical weapons in
Panama.''
</P>
<P>
   While the canal treaties do not obligate the United States to
clean up areas outside the former Canal Zone, another treaty does.
Both the United States and Panama have joined the international
Chemical Weapons Convention, which requires them to halt the
manufacture and use of all chemical weapons and to destroy their
remaining stockpiles. One section of that pact states that when
materials found in one country are determined to have come from
another, the original user-country is required to clean up the
site.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt argued that for environmental reasons Panama would be wise
to leave alone the jungle and watershed areas it is pressing the
United States to repair, since any tampering ``will affect the
canal, rainfall and temperatures.'' He and other U.S. officials
also maintained that whatever chemical weapons may have been
buried, sunk or lost in Panama no longer pose a danger because they
have dissipated.
</P>
<P>
   Stauber disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of a limited shelf life is nothing but a red herring
and a direct contradiction of the truth,'' he said. ``As long as
field munitions are in a container, they are still as good today as
50 or 60 years ago.''

GRANDMOTHER'S LIVER OFFERS BABY GIRL HOPE FOR LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BHAVNA MISTRY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ While grandparents are known for spoiling their
grandchildren, the gift that Sherry Marquez gave her granddaughter
will last a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the 44-year-old grandmother donated a quarter of
her liver to her 6-month-old granddaughter, providing little Lydia
Hand a chance at a normal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt she had a part of me from the beginning,'' said
Marquez, a mother of two whose only grandchild is Lydia.
</P>
<P>
   Lydia, daughter of Scott and Nicole Hand of Lancaster, was born
with biliary atresia, a congenital condition in which the biliary
ducts fail to develop, leading to cirrhosis of the liver, growth
retardation and jaundice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard to hear that we didn't have a healthy baby,'' said
Nicole Hand, 24. ``We're just thankful that doctors have been there
and God answered our prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lethargic and jaundiced, the infant underwent an initial surgery
at age 2 months in an attempt to fabricate ducts. That didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors recommended a transplant.
</P>
<P>
   The liver of Lydia's father, a computer programmer for
Countrywide Homes in Simi Valley, was too big. Her mother's blood
type did not match.
</P>
<P>
   Marquez, a part-time secretary at Lancaster Baptist Church,
became the choice because of her excellent health and the size of
her liver. Marquez said she was happy to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to do it,'' Marquez said. ``I wanted to give her
anything she needed.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 1, Marquez underwent surgery at the University of
Southern California to remove a 12 centimeter by 7 centimeter
section of her liver. The lobe was taken to Childrens Hospital Los
Angeles, where it was inserted into her granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The liver transplant was the first in Southern California
between living relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on a chair besides the youngster's crib Tuesday at
Childrens Hospital, Marquez played with her red-headed
granddaughter. The girl, with pudgy cheeks and large eyes, sat on
her grandmother's lap, smiling and laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time we've seen Lydia like this,'' Marquez
said. ``She's never looked healthier.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lydia's liver will grow as she does, she may have to take
anti-rejection medication for the rest of her life. She is expected
to be released from Childrens Hospital Los Angeles on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Her grandmother's liver eventually will grow to replace the
piece it lost, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a perfect fit,'' said Dr. Rick Selby of the University
of Southern California, who, with Dr. Daniel Thomas of Childrens
Hospital, oversaw the procedure. ``Her liver took to her almost
immediately. She will most likely live a normal life.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say one out of every 10,000 children is born with the
disease. Three-quarters of them undergo some sort of transplant.
</P>
<P>
   While currently the procedure is available only for infants,
doctors are working to be able to do the same for adults.
</P>
<P>
   As part of her future goals, Marquez is planning to go to the
Department of Motor Vehicles and officially sign up as an organ
donor. She already has entered her name on a list to be a bone
marrow donor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any chance I get I want to encourage others,'' Marquez said.
``Just a little bit of sacrifice could save someone's life.''

STATES ON TWISTED PATH TO WEAKER TOBACCO PACT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Conn., Iowa)   (nk) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, the attorneys general of Arizona, Connecticut and
Iowa and officials from seven other states filed into a windowless
conference room in a New York City hotel to review the latest
proposal for a national tobacco settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Only 16 months before, state regulators had reached a $368.5
billion settlement with the nation's five largest tobacco
companies, but their dizzying effort to reshape the cigarette
industry crashed this June when federal legislation needed to
cement the deal failed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, under the new proposal, cigarette makers would pay states
some $198 billion over the next 25 years, accept some marketing
bans, finance antismoking advertisements for five years and sign a
pledge not to market to children.
</P>
<P>
   But other elements of last year's plan, from the federal
regulation of nicotine to a ban on print advertising, had not even
figured in the talks. Officials at the Oct. 6 meeting went home
knowing they might soon face the choice of settling their states'
lawsuits against the industry, or battling a powerful adversary in
court.
</P>
<P>
   In a turn of fortune, the tobacco industry has weathered its
fiercest firestorm ever to define the terms of a new peace, terms
less onerous than those in last year's plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they come out as the winner,'' said Robert Rabin, a
professor of law at Stanford University who follows tobacco
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The states sued the companies to recoup health-care costs for
treating smoking related illnesses. By ending the state actions,
Rabin and others said, producers will erase lawsuits that had posed
a significant legal threat and had also depressed the companies'
stock values.
</P>
<P>
   Those involved in the latest talks insist that they fought for
the best deal possible, without pursuing certain public health
goals, like regulating nicotine, that would require federal
legislation. But the story of this latest round of tobacco talks,
which began in the spring, may be more than one of opportunities
lost for the states. As the new talks progressed, the tide of
courtroom opinions, which once seemed ready to swamp producers,
turned in their favor. Also this time, public health advocates, who
some negotiators blamed for overreaching, were excluded from the
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Although last year's plan was shaped by regulators who, fired by
public health goals, pioneered novel lawsuits against the industry,
the newest talks appear to reflect views of more conservative
regulators who apparently had different objectives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The states that sued first were much more concerned about
public health goals, not just the money they would get out of the
deal,'' said Mary Aronson, president of Aronson Washington
Research, which advises institutional investors on legal trends.
</P>
<P>
   The roots of current talks go back to May when it became
apparent that a $516 billion tobacco bill proposed by Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., would fail in the face of industry opposition. Joe
Rice, a plaintiffs lawyer from Charleston, S.C., said he had
approached outside lawyers for Philip Morris Co. and R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco, a subsidiary of RJR Nabisco Holdings Inc., in a bid to
shape a new settlement plan to deal with the 46 states that had
either sued the industry to recover smoking-related health care
costs or had not filed such actions.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, whose firm represented 25 states with such lawsuits, would
soon become a central figure in talks. But the timing of his bid
also came as momentum shifted to the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Producers had agreed to pay $40 billion over 25 years to settle
lawsuits by Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi and Texas. And in
Minnesota, they agreed to stinging terms, paying that state 50
percent more than it would have received under last year's plan.
</P>
<P>
   But the industry defeated McCain's bill, and it decided to draw
the line with the Washington state lawsuit, which was to start in
September. Pretrial decisions had weakened the state's case,
reducing the potential amount of money it could collect by
eliminating its ability to collect punitive damages. Industry
lawyers told Christine Gregoire, the Washington attorney general,
that they would not settle, said lawyers briefed on the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made it clear that they wanted to lower the bar'' of
expectations, one lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gregoire could take her chances or accept terms less
generous than those gained by Minnesota. Officials in some 20 other
states faced more daunting prospects. They had sued late and did
little to prepare their lawsuits, counting on congressional
approval of last year's plan to yield a cash windfall.
</P>
<P>
   Working with Ms. Gregoire, Rice brought some other states into
the still-secret settlement talks including New York and
California, big states that were needed to forge a deal.
Negotiators for the states and industry tried to shape a plan to
present at a July meeting of state attorneys general in Colorado.
But problems arose and a fracas among state officials erupted when
word of the talks became public.
</P>
<P>
   Three states were added to the negotiating group, but Ms.
Gregoire, who headed the team, insisted on keeping details secret.
Apparently fearing that opponents might try to torpedo the talks,
she insisted that officials briefed on their progress take a
confidentiality pledge, said lawyers involved.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, did bid to influence the talks. Both Matthew
Myers, a lawyer for the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, an advocacy
group, and Richard Scruggs, a plaintiffs lawyer who had been an
architect of last year's plan, made suggestions, including that
negotiators draft a new federal tobacco bill, said one lawyer
involved in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Myers said that he did seek to strengthen the plan's public
health provisions but denied that he had proposed new federal
legislation. Scruggs could not be reached.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While state negotiators were able to raise the industry's
original offer of $176 billion and add some public health
provisions, the course of the talks was snail-like and little
progress was made over the summer, said lawyers involved in the
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The major fracas was not between state and industry negotiators
but between cigarette makers. Two producers, R.J. Reynolds and
Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco, a subsidiary of BAT Industries, dropped
out of the talks in August after a dispute with Philip Morris over
how to deal with smaller cigarette makers who did not sign on to a
settlement plan.
</P>
<P>
   That problem was resolved about two weeks ago, lawyers said,
when the top executives of the three companies decided to give more
favorable financial treatment to R.J. Reynolds and Brown &AMP;
Williamson if producers who were not participating in the
settlement plan took away market share.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gregoire said in a recent interview that the public health
goals achieved under the new plan would outstrip those gained by
Minnesota. But state officials are concerned about a number of
provisions and are seeking to have the industry finance antismoking
advertisements beyond the five years required under the current
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers involved in the talks said there was little left to do
other than for the companies to sign off on the plan and for other
states to make their decision. Most of the states are expected to
accept the deal, which may be announced next week but could be
delayed until after the fall election.
</P>
<P>
   Rabin, the Stanford professor, said state officials would face
tough choices if a new deal was concluded. By going to court, they
face the loss of billions of dollars if they fail.
</P>
<P>
   For the industry, settling with the states may be part of a
larger plan. Internal Philip Morris documents show, for example,
that the company as early as 1991 considered giving-up many
advertising and marketing practices, including some contained in
the current deal, in exchange for federal legislation to protect it
against smoking lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, concessions that producers refused to yield in
these talks may resurface if Congress, as some expect, again takes
up whether the Food and Drug Administration should regulate the
tobacco industry. In 1996, FDA officials exerted such authority,
but a federal appeals court held in August that Congress had not
given the agency that power.
</P>
<P>
   But for now the tone among some state officials is reflective.
``This is not the end of the war on smoking,'' said Iowa Attorney
General Tom Miller. ``It is just the end of another chapter.''

GENERAL MOTORS POSTS LOSS OF $809 MILLION  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By KEITH BRADSHER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ General Motors Corp. lost $809 million in the third
quarter, mainly because of a nearly eight-week-long strike that
ended on July 29 and crippled GM's production in North America, the
automaker announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   GM's loss of $1.28 a diluted share was slightly better than
analysts' expectations. The company's North American operations
continued to cut costs aggressively, paying less for auto parts and
making factories more efficient. But Tuesday's report also showed
that the company had been discounting its vehicles heavily in North
America while its foreign operations were beginning to suffer from
economic troubles overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Auto analysts said that the strike at two GM auto parts
factories in Flint had caused so much disruption that it was hard
to draw firm conclusions from the quarter's results. ``The best
thing about the third quarter is it's over,'' said Michael Ward, an
analyst at Paine Webber. ``Going forward, the news should get more
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   GM said the strike cost it $1.2 billion in the third quarter,
the same amount it lost to the strike during the second quarter.
Michael Losh, GM's chief financial officer, said in a telephone
interview that the $2.4 billion in after-tax losses from the strike
should be pared to roughly $2 billion by the end of the year as
factories continue to work overtime to make up lost production.
</P>
<P>
   GM earned $1.04 billion during the third quarter of 1997, or
$1.34 a share, but those figures included aerospace operations that
GM has since sold. Excluding the aerospace operations, the strike
and a $271 million after-tax charge for the disposal of some auto
parts factories, GM's profits fell 28.4 percent during the third
quarter, to $697 million, compared with $973 million in the quarter
a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   GM's sales in the third quarter plunged to $34.42 billion, from
$41.89 billion in the quarter a year earlier, partly because some
operations were sold but mainly because of the strike.
</P>
<P>
   Losh said that with the third quarter behind it, GM was well
positioned for the fourth quarter. The introductions of new pickup
trucks in North America and the new Opel Astra sedan in Europe were
expensive during the third quarter but should start helping the
automaker's results, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While GM spent an unusually high average of $1,732 a vehicle in
discounts in the North American market during the third quarter,
that figure fell to $1,400 for sales at the end of September, Losh
said. Full-sized pickup trucks require virtually no discounts to
sell, and GM had very few of them until the end of the quarter
because it was changing the design.
</P>
<P>
   The weakening of the dollar this month may also make it harder
for foreign automakers to offer discounts, easing the pressure on
GM to provide large discounts. ``One of the things that ought to
help us is the yen is not 135 or 145'' to the dollar, Losh said.
The dollar was trading at 119.15 yen late Tuesday in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts generally accepted GM's predictions that with
the strike more than two months in the past, discounts might
dwindle. ``Once you get your '98 models cleared out and your floor
traffic back, then you can cut the incentives,'' said Greg Salchow,
an auto analyst at Roney &AMP; Co., a brokerage house here.
</P>
<P>
   Investors had little reaction Tuesday to GM's results. Shares of
GM fell 87.5 cents, to $51.0625, in a falling market.
</P>
<P>
   GM announced plans in August to sell or spin off a 20 percent
stake in Delphi Automotive Systems, its huge auto parts subsidiary,
early next year, and Losh reaffirmed those plans Tuesday. GM's
longstanding intention to wait until next year may allow enough
time for financial markets to settle down, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The strike pushed GM's cash reserves down to $11.5 billion on
Sept. 30 from $14.6 billion a year earlier and $12.1 billion on
June 30. Losh said that GM expected the reserves to rebound soon to
the company's target of $13 billion. When that happens, GM will
resume the $4 billion share buyback program that it announced in
March and suspended last summer in response to the strike, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   One of the sharpest tumbles in GM's earnings occurred in the
unit handling automotive operations in Latin America, Africa and
the Middle East. Mainly because of the high interest rates and weak
economy in Brazil, previously one of GM's most profitable markets,
the division reported a loss in the third quarter of $64 million
after a $165 million after-tax profit a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   GM automotive operations in Europe earned $50 million in the
third quarter after losing $21 million in the quarter a year
earlier. GM's tiny Asian automotive division made $2 million in
profits in the last three months after losing $7 million in the
third quarter of last year. General Motors Acceptance Corp., which
makes car loans and leases, earned $313 million in the third
quarter, virtually unchanged from a $312 million gain in the
quarter a year earlier.

OUSTED ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER ANNOUNCES HE WILL TRY AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Acting Prime Minister Romano Prodi said Tuesday night
that he would try to form a government, four days after he was
ousted after narrowly losing a confidence vote.
</P>
<P>
   Prodi, who was offered a second chance by President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro, must now cobble together a majority in Parliament. He
called that process ``delicate.''
</P>
<P>
   He will most likely seek to form an alliance with a small
center-right party to make up for Communist votes that split away
last week, causing him to lose the confidence vote. The center-left
majority that brought him to power in 1996 splintered after a
hard-line Communist leader withdrew his party's support over the
1999 budget and unemployment policy.
</P>
<P>
   That defection split the Communist ranks, as the more moderate
wing left to form its own party, unwilling to be held responsible
for defeating a leftist government. But their votes are not enough
to give Prodi a majority in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   A formal union between Prodi and the center-right party of
Francesco Cossiga, which is in the opposition, will require highly
delicate maneuvering by both men. Prodi has often said he will
govern only with the majority that elected him two and a half years
ago _ and he repeated it most vehemently the day after his defeat.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he said that he would govern only if allowed to
pursue the same policies he espoused in his first incarnation as
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``The possibility of forming a new executive will depend on the
possibility of keeping to the program presented to the
electorate,'' Prodi said after his meeting with Scalfaro. ``I will
get down to work immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   While the onetime center-right allies of Cossiga mocked his
sudden shift of allegiance, he sought to paint his support for a
new Prodi government as a patriotic sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Italy, Cossiga warned, cannot afford to be without an
authoritative government just when it is preparing to enter the
single European currency. ``The consequences on internal markets,
on our economy and on our international image will be gravely
affected if we find it impossible to pass a budget,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While budget disputes pushed Prodi's government over the brink,
widespread concern that the budget might not be approved in time to
meet the Jan. 1 start date of the European currency has helped push
Prodi back to the brink of being in office.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian central bank has said that it will not cut lending
rates _ a requirement for membership in the European currency _
until Italy has a budget that includes $9 billion in spending cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Some political leaders have said they want Prodi to return to
power long enough to pass the budget, then face another confidence
vote. Even if Prodi does not formally agree to that condition,
there is little question that the stability his government had come
to represent _ it was the second-longest in Italy since World War
II _ has been badly weakened.
</P>
<P>
   Even many Italians unenamored of Prodi, a low-key former
economist, have expressed concern about a return of the chronic
instability that marked Italian politics for decades. If Prodi
manages to succeed himself in office, that victory could
nevertheless be clouded by memories of past revolving-door
governments.

 &HT;    Brown taking blame for debacle
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Letting manager Bruce Bochy off the hook for failing
to deliver a knockout punch in Game 5, Kevin Brown shouldered the
blame for the Padres' loss on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare baseball scene, two of the sport's best starters _
Brown and Greg Maddux _ were summoned from the bullpen to try to
save a game. Brown and the Padres were five outs from the World
Series when Michael Tucker, an unlikely hero, hit a sinker that
didn't sink and saved the Braves from elimination with a three-run
shot into the right-field seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel particularly bad from the standpoint that people will
second-guess Boch for using me, but it was nobody's fault but my
own,'' Brown said after the game. ``I had the ball and didn't do
the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown came on in the seventh and retired the side after Ozzie
Guillen singled. Then in the eighth, Ryan Klesko walked and Javy
Lopez singled past shortstop Chris Gomez. That brought Tucker to
the plate and led to the pitch Brown would love to have back.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you be in that situation and not be disappointed by
the results?'' Brown asked. ``If you're not disappointed, you don't
care about the game. I got through the first inning, but didn't
have the same location in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing much to say beyond that. My stuff was good,
but my location wasn't. The bottom line is that I walked the
leadoff hitter in that inning. If you're going to second-guess,
second-guess that.''
</P>
<P>
   Big deal
</P>
<P>
   In the Padres' media guide, there's a special note on ``The
Trade.'' You might think it has something to do with one of the
whoppers pulled off in the days when Jack McKeon ran the
organization, but it involves a 1994 deal by the current hierarchy
with the Houston Astros. In all, a dozen players changed teams,
including third baseman Ken Caminiti and center fielder Steve
Finley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finley turned out to be a much better player than we ever
thought he was,'' general manager Kevin Towers said. ``Caminiti is
the one that stood out. But, really, it was two organizations
looking to shake things up. Similar organizations, similar
payrolls. It's been beneficial to both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Towers credits the deft work of his scouting staff in keeping
the Padres competitive with the major-market, big-money franchises
like New York and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Not this time
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's Tony Gwynn has 35 career hits against Maddux. But in
the ninth inning Monday night, with Gwynn at the plate representing
the winning run, Maddux induced him to hit a grounder to first base
to end the game. Gwynn is 0-for-3 against Maddux in the NLCS,
dropping his career mark against the Braves ace to .438.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends
</P>
<P>
   A throwing error by shortstop Chris Gomez in Game 5 put an end
to a Padres streak of eight-plus NLCS games without an error,
dating back to the 1984 postseason . . . Braves first baseman
Andres Galarraga, a former Gold Glove winner, has four errors in
five games _ the most ever in the NLCS.

 &HT;    Padres rest Brown, go with Hitchcock
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ San Diego will give ace Kevin Brown another day's rest
and go with Sterling Hitchcock today in Game 6 of the National
League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander, who gave up three hits in five good innings to
win Game 3, will go against Braves left-hander Tom Glavine, who
last pitched in the Game 2 loss six days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock made it clear that he was ready to pitch his first
game of the season on three days rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me in last night's game that he wanted the ball for
tomorrow's game,'' pitching coach Dave Stewart said during a
workout Tuesday at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   And because Brown already had the ball in Game 5 in a rare
relief performance, the decision ``wasn't really that close,'' said
manager Bruce Bochy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite as much as (Brown) throws in his bullpen,'' Bochy
said, ``if you go out there and you go all-out for 40-something
pitches, it's going to take a little bit more out of you. So we
just felt it was best to go this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the Game 2 winner, entered the game with a 4-2 lead in
the seventh. He pitched 1 1/3 innings in the 7-6 loss Monday, with
Michael Tucker hitting a 3-run homer off the seemingly invincible
Padre in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Bochy's decision to put in his ace has been second-guessed from
coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I had my best guy out there,'' said Bochy. ``Hey,
things didn't work out. But it's not a case where I can't use him
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Bochy said Brown didn't campaign to start today.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's fine,'' said the manager, who reached Brown by telephone
at his home in Macon. ``He does what he thinks is best for the
ballclub _ or what we think. And Sterling's set to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock threw only 93 pitches in Game 3, so the Padres coaches
feel he's fresh. Joey Hamilton, the Game 4 starter, would be
available in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows that tomorrow's game could be a game that we can
clinch it,'' Stewart said of Hitchcock. ``I just don't want him to
get too anxious. Go out with a nice, even temperament and give us
an opportunity to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitch is going to have to come out and throw the ball like he
did in Game 3 for us to have a chance,'' said Tony Gwynn, who's
hoping to make his second World Series in a 17-year career. ``The
guys we're facing, they're not giving you much to take a good hack
at.''
</P>
<P>
   By saving Brown, and if the Padres win today, would he be ready
for Game 1 of the World Series?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not even thinking about that,'' said Bochy. ``We're
concentrating on the Atlanta Braves right now.''

 &HT;    Braves fans get back in the game
 &HT;    By Michael Lee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the Braves ticket office opened at 8:30 a.m.
Tuesday, about 11,000 seats remained for Game 6 of the National
League Championship Series this afternoon against the San Diego
Padres.
</P>
<P>
   When the ticket windows closed at 6 p.m., virtually every seat
was sold.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's fans, roundly criticized for their lack of numbers and
noise in home Games 1 and 2, seem to have rediscovered pennant
fever. After two rousing victories in San Diego, the Braves trail
3-2 in the best-of-seven series. But they'll be back home before a
packed house at Turner Field this afternoon (4:1520 p.m. on Fox).
</P>
<P>
   Some fans lined up shortly after midnight to be sure to get
seats for today's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cold, but I wanted to get a jump on Ticketmaster,'' said
Deanna Fuller, along with her sister Tina, arrived at 12:30 a.m.
and sat through the rest of the chilly night.
</P>
<P>
   Between the stadium windows and Ticketmaster outlets, available
seats went quickly. Standing-room tickets will go on sale today at
8:30 a.m. at the stadium. They are $25 and can be purchased only
with cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``After watching the games and seeing how San Diego fans
responded to their team, it sparked a little fire under the fans
here,'' said Paul Adams, Braves director of ticket sales. ``I think
they realized we had the same level of fans here. They're going
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams said a few thousand seats remain for a possible Game 7 on
Thursday night. If the series ends today with a Padres win, fans
with tickets for that game will receive a refund.

 FTC Sets Deadline on Internet Privacy Rules   By Jamie Beckett and Dan Fost  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
The Federal Trade Commission is giving the electronic commerce
industry until January to set voluntary guidelines for Internet
privacy before it pursues legislation in Congress, FTC Commissioner
Mozelle Thompson said yesterday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   An FTC survey this year found that 89 percent of all Web sites
collect some form of private information from consumers, but only
14 percent disclose that they're doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Many Web sites sell information they collect from visitors to
direct marketers.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses currently have no legal incentive to disclose their
privacy policies _ including what information they collect and what
they do with it. The FTC cannot require Web sites to do so, but it
can go after those that post policies and then violate them.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said he hopes Web sites will voluntarily post their
privacy policies because it's good for business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies' economic future depends on making people feel good
on the Internet,'' he said in a meeting with Chronicle reporters.
``People are not going to buy on the Internet if they don't feel
safe.''
</P>
<P>
   A law requiring sites that collect information from children to
obtain parental permission is pending before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Thompson painted the agency as the defender of consumers. The
FTC's recent antitrust actions against proposed mergers of drug
wholesalers, for instance, was designed to make sure the industry
wasn't controlled by giants.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; A U.S. District Court judge sided with the FTC and blocked the
nation's four largest drug wholesalers, including San Francisco's
McKesson Corp., from merging into two companies.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  When companies claim that a merger will allow them to
``achieve efficiencies,'' Thompson said, the FTC asks, ``But for
who? Are you going to make prices lower? Or give a bigger return to
shareholders?''
</P>
<P>
   The FTC is pressing an antitrust suit against Santa Clara chip
giant Intel Corp., slated for trial in February. Thompson wouldn't
comment on that case. He also wouldn't discuss other FTC
investigations, or the Department of Justice's case against
Microsoft Corp., but he indicated that the FTC shows no signs of
letting up in its pursuit of antitrust violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any competitor wants to be in a dominant market position,''
Thompson said. ``It's a law of nature. ... But to the extent the
company's behavior has a negative effect on innovation or
competition, that presents a problem. ... And if you use strength
in one market sector to achieve dominance in another market sector,
then that's an antitrust problem.''

 Intel Beats Street, But Earnings Still Flat   By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Citing a rebound in sales of personal computers, Intel reported
record revenue for the third quarter yesterday, along with profits
that beat Wall Street estimates.
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Nevertheless, the earnings were flat from a year ago, and
Intel's stock dipped in after-market trading, suggesting that the
performance won't be a big help to other technology stocks today.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors may wait until Compaq Computer, another industry
bellwether, reports its earnings today to decide whether the PC
industry is healthy heading into the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released after the market closed, Santa Clara's
Intel said it earned $1.6 billion (89 cents a share), almost a
carbon copy of last year, when it made $1.6 billion (88 cents).
Analysts had been expecting Intel to earn just 80 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues for the three months ended September 26 were $6.7
billion, 9 percent higher than the $6.2 billion it had a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Income was flat largely because of the cost of parts Intel
must buy from outside sources to make its Pentium II chips.
</P>
<P>
   In after-hours trading, Intel shares Intel dipped to $82.50,
after closing the regular session at $83.56, down $1.88.
</P>
<P>
   Intel chief executive Craig Barrett expressed satisfaction with
the results, noting that the company enjoyed revenue growth nearly
everywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett also predicted a slight sales increase in the current
quarter. In recent quarters, the company has predicted flat sales
or just slight growth.
</P>
<P>
   Shipments of Pentium processors set a record in the quarter, the
company said, noting that it now is barely able to meet demand.
</P>
<P>
   During the quarter, Intel introduced several new products,
including a high-end 450 MHz Pentium II for PCs, an improved
low-end Celeron and the new Xeon, a chip for powerful computer
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Intel said its gross profit margins, which are the envy of the
industry, rose to 53 percent from 49 percent in the second quarter.
The increase resulted from a tilt toward sales of higher-priced
chips, as well as from efforts to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it has reduced its head count by about 2,000
since the end of the first quarter, mostly through attrition and
buyouts. It said it's on track to eliminate 3,000 jobs by the end
of the year, out of a total workforce of 60,000.
</P>
<P>
   The results were Intel's best in several quarters; its earnings
fell 29 percent in the second quarter. But some analysts predict
that the company may have a hard time sustaining sales in the face
of increasing competition and an uncertain world economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They reported a good number at the high end of expectations,
but you're clearly not going to see that kind of pop again,'' said
Jonathan Joseph of NationsBank Montgomery Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph credited some of Intel's growth to the actions of
PC-makers who stepped up purchases of chips in the quarter after
being forced to slash bloated inventories earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst David Wu said that barring a depression in Asia, Intel
may be out of the woods and back on a pattern of growth. But he
emphasized that 1998 is shaping up overall as a disappointing year
for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Intel is on a pace to have sales of $25.9 billion this year, Wu
said, up slightly from last year's $25.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relative to expectations, today's numbers were quite good,''
he said. ``But relative to last year, it's not something you want
to write home about.''

 Safeway to Buy Dominick's for $1.85 Billion   By Rebecca Smith  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Pleasanton's Safeway Inc. said yesterday it will buy Chicago's
Dominick's Supermarkets Inc. for $1.85 billion in cash and debt.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The combined company will be second only to No. 1 Kroger Co. of
Cincinnati and will have 1,493 stores in 18 states and annual sales
exceeding $26.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the purchase of a Midwest chain may seem
irrelevant to California shoppers who've never stepped inside a
Dominick's store. But industry watchers believe the combination
will result in some ingenious practices migrating to Safeway stores
from Dominick's.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago supermarket chain has found ways to provide fresh,
not frozen, convenience foods capable of stemming the ``defection''
of grocery shoppers to take-out restaurants and fast-food
establishments, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago chain has made a name for itself as an innovator
that has converted half of its 112 locations into ``fresh stores''
with expanded perishables departments. Renovated stores have a
``European open market'' look that includes a bigger selection of
fruits and vegetables, including exotic and organic items not
typically stocked by rival supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Dominick's meat departments have more items already seasoned and
ready for the grill or oven. In-store ``cafes'' offer fresh-baked
pizza, hibachi chicken and other prepared meals that time-pressed
shoppers can take home and reheat for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Safeway can learn a lot from Dominick's,'' said Laura
Richardson, retail analyst for Pacific Crest Securities in
Portland, Ore. ``One of the trends we're seeing in industry
consolidation is buyers learning from those they're acquiring,
typically strong companies with good names.''

   Caspian Sea: White House Presses Pipeline Plan
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House will try to persuade 15 American
oil companies to adopt its plan for building a pipeline from the
oil fields of the Caspian Sea through Turkey. National security
adviser Sandy Berger scheduled a discussion of the project with the
chief executives of the companies for Oct. 22. American officials
say they consider the issue open. Some administration officials,
congressional aides and oil executives said last week that the
companies were expected to recommend building the pipeline from
Baku in Azerbaijan to Supsa in Georgia. The United States wants the
pipeline extended through Turkey to a terminal at Ceyhan.

<P>
   LONDON _ A Parliamentary committee recommended a spending cap of
$34 million for each party in a national election, well below the
$91 million that the Conservative and Labor Parties together spent
last year. The long-awaited report also proposed public disclosure
of contributions that exceed $8,000 and called for tax deductions
on gifts up to $850 to spur small donations. The main
recommendations are extremely likely to become law next year. Lord
Neill, chairman of the committee, said the lack of spending limits
had given rise to ``something of an arms race.''

   MOSCOW _ President Boris Yeltsin will stay at his country house
until Friday to recover from bronchitis, the Kremlin said Tuesday.
The Russian press has speculated that the Kremlin is covering up
the seriousness of the president's illness. The Kremlin press
service said it would not issue regular assessments of Yeltsin's
health because he is merely suffering from a cold.

   MEXICO CITY _ The president of the National Action Party
proposed that electoral laws be amended to allow for a two-round
presidential election in 2000. The leader, Felipe Calderon, said
that by reducing the field to two leading candidates in the first
round, the winner of a second round would be president with the

   Ecuador: Indians Win Round Against Texaco

<P>
   Indians from the Oriente rainforest have won another chance to
pursue a $1 billion suit against Texaco. The Indians say the oil
company polluted the forest and rivers during two decades of
pumping oil in Ecuador. The U.S 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in New
York reversed a dismissal of the case last year, sending it back
the District Court for review. Representing 30,000 residents of the
forest, the suit asks Texaco to pay for health and environmental
damage, cleanup and rebuilding its equipment to meet U.S.
standards.

INTEL BEATS EXPECTATIONS ON STRONG DEMAND FOR CHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Buoyed by vibrant demand for microprocessors,
Intel Corp. reported unexpectedly strong third-quarter results
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although earnings were essentially flat relative to a year
earlier, they were well above analysts' estimates, which were
raised after Intel advised last month that it would beat its own
forecast.
</P>
<P>
   The strong results at Intel, the world's leading maker of chips
for personal computers, came even as it faces the toughest
competition in more than a decade. Last week Advanced Micro Devices
Inc. also reported unexpectedly strong results, as well as market
research statistics showing it was gaining market share from Intel,
particularly in PCs priced under $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   National Semiconductor Corp.'s Cyrix division is also making
inroads at the low end of the market; IBM remains a threat and
newcomers like Integrated Device Technology, Rise, Transmeta and
Metaflow loom on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Intel said it expected fourth-quarter sales to be up slightly
from the third quarter, while profit margins would be flat to
slightly up as well. Intel had originally forecast third-quarter
revenues to be flat relative to the second quarter, later amended
that to a gain of 8 percent to 10 percent, and actually reported a
14 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of resilience in the chip industry, Cypress
Semiconductor Inc., a maker of specialized memory chips, said it
remained marginally profitable in the third quarter, defying
expectations of a loss.
</P>
<P>
   Intel reported results after the close of the market. Intel
shares closed at $83.56, down $1.88. Cypress shares closed at
$8.81, down 6 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel did a fabulous job capturing the demand opportunities
out there and that will continue into the fourth quarter,'' said
Mark Edelstone, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. He
said Intel benefited from the greater efficiency offered by new
chip production technologies that crammed more circuitry into
smaller pieces of silicon.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended Sept. 26, Intel reported earnings of $1.56
billion, or 89 cents a diluted share, down slightly from $1.57
billion, or 88 cents a share, in the comparable period a year
earlier. The share figures reflect an increase in the number of
shares outstanding. Revenues grew 9 percent, to $6.73 billion, from
$6.16 billion in the third quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected 80 cents a share, according to First Call
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased with our overall performance in the last
quarter,'' said Craig Barrett, Intel's president and chief
executive, who added that the results reflected ``growth across
nearly all of our geographies and product lines, including strong
microprocessor sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel officials said they had expected demand to recover in the
fourth quarter, due partly to normal seasonal fluctuations, but
also because PC manufacturers appeared to have worked through an
inventory glut that had depressed microprocessor sales in previous
quarters. Actual demand, particularly in the later part of the
quarter, proved stronger than they had expected, they said.
</P>
<P>
   But Drew Peck, an analyst with Cowen &AMP; Co., cautioned that this
level of demand was not likely to last. ``Clearly the personal
computer companies are not going to show the same improved results
we've seen at Intel, so the only conclusion you can reach is there
was significant inventory replenishment taking place in the third
quarter,'' he said. ``I think results will improve for Intel in the
fourth quarter as well, but not nearly so dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel has responded to increased competition by improving its
manufacturing efficiency and cutting operating costs, but also by
segmenting its product line. The company now offers the Celeron
line at the low end; Pentium II for mainstream desktop and laptop
computers, and Pentium II Xeon for work stations and servers. Intel
officials said average selling prices had remained flat this year
despite greater competition.

NO NEED FOR WORLD RATE CUT, EUROPEAN BANK CHIEF SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Despite growing anxiety that global
financial problems might soon affect Europe, the president of the
new European Central Bank on Tuesday rejected demands to relax
monetary policy in an effort to spur economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   In a toughly worded message aimed in part at European political
leaders, the central bank said there was no need for worldwide
reductions in interest rates or other forms of ``policy activism''
to jump-start economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is certainly some kind of slowdown, but not a crisis,''
said Wim Duisenberg, who as president of the European Central Bank
now oversees monetary policy across the 11 countries that will
adopt the euro as a single currency Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Proposals for a reassessment of capital controls as an
acceptable policy option, or recent calls for worldwide, uniform
interest rate reductions, are inappropriate as they do not address
the very nature of the problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Duisenberg's remarks, which came after a meeting of the bank's
governing council, underline a growing divergence between monetary
policy in Europe and the United States. While the Federal Reserve
has begun lowering U.S. interest rates amid fear of a significant
slowdown in the economy, the European bankers are barely flinching
from their original course and remain preoccupied with establishing
the new currency's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising effect of that policy has been the strength of
existing European currencies, like the German mark and the French
franc, which essentially mirror expectations for the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Traders, far from being skittish about an untested currency in
the offing, have begun buying the current national currencies as a
haven from global shocks in Asia, Latin America and Russia. The
mark and the franc are nearly 10 percent stronger against the
dollar than they were in August.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the European Central Bank has come under
increasing pressure from national leaders to either reduce interest
rates or support other measures to keep European growth from
slipping.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder has called for
lower rates, and his designated finance minister has repeatedly
assailed the German central bank's, and by extension the European
bank's, tight-money policies as misguided. The French Cabinet
continues its complaints against those policies.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists predict that growth in the so-called euro zone
will remain above 2.5 percent through the end of 1998 but will
substantially slow next year. The continuing problems in Asia and
Latin America are expected to curtail demand for European exports,
and the recent shift in exchange rates will dig more deeply by
making European exports more expensive in dollar terms.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of slowing growth are already becoming apparent in
Germany, where industrial exports have been the economic engine in
the last 18 months. Machine-tool and engineering companies have
lowered their forecasts for exports next year. Hoechst, the
chemical and pharmaceutical giant, warned Monday that its profits
in the second half of this year would fall below those in the
period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   European banks are also reporting big setbacks and are
eliminating thousands of jobs because of losses in securities
trading, soured foreign loans and heightened competitive pressure.
In the last 10 days, the chairmen of two leading financial
institutions _ UBS of Switzerland and ING Barings in the
Netherlands _ have resigned in the wake of big losses. Some
analysts expect more bad news in the months ahead, predicting that
banks will be forced to write off more foreign loans than they
already have.
</P>
<P>
   Duisenberg acknowledged that financial crises elsewhere would
affect Europe. ``The number of signs suggesting that the world
economy will slow down in 1999 is increasing,'' he said at a news
conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday. He also noted that uncertainty
had been heightened by the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital
Management, the American hedge fund, and by the losses at
individual banks.
</P>
<P>
   But he insisted that ``proposals inspired by policy activism''
must be avoided. He said he was not concerned about the recent
plunge in the exchange value of the dollar, which could hurt
European exports. And he said European interest rates were about
where they should be. ``There are no signs of a credit crunch in
Europe,'' he maintained.
</P>
<P>
   The European Central Bank is still struggling with the tools it
will use to set monetary policy, torn between basing it simply on
the growth of the money supply or on inflation targets. In
principle, many central bankers would prefer to follow the example
of the Bundesbank, which bases lending rates almost entirely on the
growth of the German money supply. In practice, money statistics
vary considerably between countries in the new currency union, and
new forms of financial transactions have further complicated the
definitions of money.
</P>
<P>
   After months of debate behind closed doors, Duisenberg announced
that the bank would use both money supply and inflation targets.
The overall goal will be to keep inflation under 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Duisenberg acknowledged the bank was under pressure. ``The
political pressure could increase _ I would not deny that,'' he
said. ``But it is pressure against a strong institution. We will
make our own judgments, use our own analysis and reach our own
decisions.''

FORD TO PRODUCE GEARLESS CAR TRANSMISSION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)  (bl) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Ford Motor Co. announced plans Tuesday for mass
production of a new, gearless car transmission to be produced in a
joint venture that could also become a new model for labor
relations in the auto industry.
</P>
<P>
   The new transmission, which uses a system of pulleys instead of
gears, allowing many subtle gradations of power to speed, improves
fuel economy by 10 percent to 15 percent, Ford said. Large-scale
installation of the new transmission would help Ford meet federal
fuel-economy regulations in the United States and compete in
foreign markets where gas prices are high and fuel economy is
important to car buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said that it would form the joint venture with ZF
Friedrichshafen AG of Germany, which had patented a design for a
so-called continuously variable automatic transmission. Ford will
own 49 percent of the venture and ZF will own 51 percent. The two
companies said they would begin installing the transmissions in
2001 model-year cars and would install a million of the new
transmissions annually by 2005 at a Ford transmission factory in
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The transmissions would be installed mainly in small Ford cars
in the United States and abroad. But Ford also planned to sell some
to other automakers overseas, said Jacques Nasser, the president of
Ford's worldwide automotive operations, who will become Ford's
chief executive at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's choice of a joint venture to build the new transmissions
also opened the door for it to make the first use of an unusual
provision in all of the Big Three's labor contracts since 1996. The
provision allowed the automakers to pay lower wages in any new auto
parts businesses that they enter through joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser said that all current employees at the company's
transmission factory in Batavia, Ohio, would remain Ford employees.
But any future hires would be employees of the new joint venture,
and Ford would eventually like to have a separate labor agreement
at the factory, he told reporters Tuesday.

EDUCATION BECOMES KEY ISSUE IN BUDGET TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, smoothing throughout, reflecting that Tuesday
night talks ended inconclusively)  (sw) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Struggling to meet their fourth deadline over the
federal budget, congressional Republicans and White House officials
wrestled Tuesday with their differences over education, the most
politically high-stakes element of the budget battle.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators ended a late-night session without resolving
disagreements over not just education, but the census and
contraceptives. These were among the biggest issues that still
separated the two sides as each tried to formulate a message to
take home to voters for the Nov. 3 elections.
</P>
<P>
   On education, the issue that President Clinton has propelled to
the forefront and on which Republicans do not want to appear
recalcitrant, both sides have agreed to spend more than $1 billion
but not on how to spend it. The president insists that the money be
spent to hire 100,000 teachers across the country so that the
average class can be reduced to 18 students. Republicans, railing
against ``Beltway bureaucrats,'' say that local school districts
should decide how the money is spent, whether it be for teachers or
computers.
</P>
<P>
   As the two sides broke Tuesday night, White House chief of staff
Erskine Bowles, the president's top negotiator, emerged from the
session saying: ``We don't have a deal. We made some good progress.
The biggest issue, still, is the 100,000 teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``There are still some open issues'' upon which no
agreement has been reached, but he sounded optimistic about a
session scheduled for Wednesday morning. ``I think we've got a
chance of wrapping up tomorrow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides remained apart on several ideological matters,
including whether to allow federal health plans to cover
contraceptives and whether to allow those few plans with religious
affiliations to refuse to cover contraceptives not only on
religious grounds but on moral grounds as well.
</P>
<P>
   They were also split on how to conduct the census in 2000, which
is one of the thorniest issues. It is not one that moves voters,
but it is vital to both parties because it helps determine their
relative strength in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Bowles met for much of the day
in the speaker's office, shuttling in and out of ante-rooms with
their lieutenants but giving few clues about the nitty-gritty
details of their talks.
</P>
<P>
   They have given themselves another deadline of midnight
Wednesday to wrap up about $500 billion worth of spending items,
but they could easily extend that deadline another day or two. They
missed having spending bills in place for the Oct. 1 start of the
fiscal year, providing temporary financing for the federal
government through Oct. 9, then Oct. 12, then Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the other central issues, like financing for the
International Monetary Fund, were all but nailed down, but neither
side was ready to declare a final deal until all the other elements
of the budget package were in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're down to splitting infinitives,'' House Majority Leader
Dick Armey said of approving money for the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   As they worked through several issues, Republican leaders
appeared to be calculating the differences in their own party that
might sour a final deal when it arrives on the House floor _ more
of a concern than the Senate floor because the Senate has fewer
differences among its Republicans and with the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Some conservative Republicans said they were concerned over the
emerging shape of the final package, particularly elements dealing
with family planning and emergency spending.
</P>
<P>
   They say the president's proposals for emergency spending, on
such items as the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, fixing the year
2000 computer bug and providing relief to American farmers, will
break the limits in last year's balanced-budget agreement. The
administration said such money would come from corresponding cuts
elsewhere in the budget, but conservatives say it comes from
raiding the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   If Republican leaders cannot count on their conservatives, they
will need support from Democrats to pass the final package. And
Democrats on Tuesday expressed concern over some White House
positions, on issues like the census and an apparent compromise
with Republicans on aid for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., a leader of House conservatives,
said he believed Republican leaders were ceding too quickly to the
White House. He said that the president appeared to be getting his
way on some issues but that what he really seemed to be winning was
the war of public relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is getting what he wants; he's controlling the
situation,'' McIntosh lamented. When Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott appears on television, McIntosh said, ``it's in reaction to
the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, McIntosh suggested that he could vote for a final
accord. ``Most conservatives are holding out for a better deal than
we're hearing,'' he said, ``but we'll probably give them the vote
because we don't see a much better alternative happening if it goes
down.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)

</P>
<P>
   Others were distressed, particularly about two contraceptive
issues. One would require federal health plans to cover
contraceptives. The other would bar overseas family-planning
organizations from lobbying to change abortion laws in other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., said he wanted to see the final
language on the health plan measure. As it passed both the House
and the Senate, it allowed for health plans with religious
affiliation to decline to offer contraceptive coverage; Coburn
wants plans to be able to refuse such coverage on moral grounds as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The plan covers five specific types of contraception. Coburn
said he wanted two of those _ Depo-Provera and intrauterine devices
_ to be eliminated from coverage because he said they interfered
with fertilization and were therefore considered to cause
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats like Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., who introduced the
contraceptive plan in the House, said she strongly objected to
Coburn's position. She said that health plans based their decisions
on what to offer on profits, not morals.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether the White House will insist on keeping
the contraceptive coverage in the final package and will oppose the
moral exception. If the administration allows the moral exception,
it could alienate some House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats are also worried about the direction the talks
are taking on the census. This has always loomed as one of the
biggest issues separating Democrats and Republicans. The results of
a census help determine the future power of the two political
parties. But the fact that the two sides are finally talking about
it now indicates that they are covering the full range of budget
matters that need to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has proposed buying time on the matter by
financing the Commerce, State and Justice departments only for five
months. The Commerce Department contains the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said this would put off the nettlesome
issue while allowing a resolution of the entire spending package,
but House Democrats worry it would be a prelude to giving in to
Republicans down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders like the idea of postponing a decision but
say that financing should be restricted only for the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   On several touchy environmental issues that have prompted
repeated veto threats from the White House, the two sides appeared
to be opting for compromise over confrontation, with several
disputes resolved. But a few particularly difficult issues remained
under negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   A compromise was struck between the White House and Alaskan
lawmakers on logging in the Tongass National Forest. But compromise
still eluded them on the question of building a road through a
wilderness refuge to connect two communities in Alaska.

EDITORIAL: VACCO'S QUESTIONABLE INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Oct. 14:
</P>
<P>
   It is a familiar story under New York's flaccid campaign finance
laws. Attorney General Dennis Vacco accepted campaign contributions
from a company's executives and subsidiaries suspiciously close to
the time of his settlement of complaints against the company. The
settlement was far more favorable than a similar investigation of
the same company eight years earlier under a previous attorney
general.
</P>
<P>
   The Vacco campaign protests that there was no connection between
the donations and the softer landing for a large auto leasing
company called Oxford Resources of Long Island. The campaign says
the contributions were legal, and that may well be true _ unless
somebody proves that Vacco delivered a quid pro quo for the
donations. But the money hangs over this inquiry like a dark cloud.
</P>
<P>
   As outlined Tuesday by Clifford J. Levy in The Times, the
earlier investigation of Oxford, in 1990, resulted in charges of
deceptive practices that required the company to issue refunds, pay
$10,000 in fines and reform its methods of operating. Under the
latest settlement, some refunds of disputed amounts were paid but
there were no fines and no allegations of wrongdoing. While the
investigation was going on, Oxford executives and a company
subsidiary donated $8,500 to Vacco's campaign. Less than three
weeks after the investigation was closed, the Vacco campaign
received an additional $37,500 from nine Oxford subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco is not the first state official to face embarrassing
questions about his contributors. New York state's comptroller,
Carl McCall, has received contributions from lawyers, investment
officials and others who were awarded contracts involving the
state's $100 billion pension fund. Federal investigators are trying
to determine whether there is any connection between $100,000
donated to Gov. George Pataki's campaign by a construction company
that was awarded a $97 million contract to repair the
Queens-Midtown Tunnel last year.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Vacco is not alone, however, should not bring him
relief. As the chief law enforcement official in the state, he
should work harder to make certain a company cannot appear to buy a
better legal deal under his public trust. His campaign's process of
``scrubbing'' contributions from those under investigation missed
the Oxford case. The attorney general should return the Oxford
contributions and refuse to accept any further money from
contributors who have matters pending before his office. After
that, he or his successor should join the fight to clean up
campaign finance in New York state.

MOBSTER TESTIFIES HE SPIED ON TERROR SUSPECTS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An admitted Mafia member testified at his murder
trial Tuesday that while in jail he spied for the government on
four other inmates _ the mastermind of the World Trade Center
bombing and three others eventually convicted of terrorist acts _
and reported their plans for further acts to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant, Gregory Scarpa Jr., testified in federal District
Court in Brooklyn that, using a tiny ``spy camera'' that a jail
official had given him, he worked undercover for the FBI for about
a year in 1996 and 1997 after gaining the confidence of the others
while all of them were being held in a high-security area of a
federal jail in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Scarpa was awaiting his current trial on charges
that include participation in five gangland murders, racketeering
and other charges.
</P>
<P>
   The four other inmates, including Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, who was
convicted in November 1997 as the chief plotter of the World Trade
Center bombing, which killed six people, were either being tried or
were awaiting trial. The three others were convicted with Yousef,
one in the 1993 Trade Center bombing and two in an aborted plot to
blow up American airliners in the Far East.
</P>
<P>
   Scarpa said he told the FBI that associates of the four men
planned to kill a prosecutor in one of Yousef's trials, attack a
federal judge whom Scarpa did not identify, and attack ``government
installations'' that he did not specify.
</P>
<P>
   Among the things he photographed, he said, were notes he
received from Yousef, who Scarpa said wanted the notes returned,
and ``timing devices.'' He did not explain what those devices were
or how the inmates managed to obtain them in the jail, the
Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan, which prosecuted Yousef
and the others, the U.S. Attorney's office in Brooklyn, which is
prosecuting Scarpa, and the FBI all declined to comment on his
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   It could not be learned how reliable or useful the information
had been and why the cooperation he described had not helped him
obtain a lenient plea deal in his own case. Scarpa's lawyer, Larry
Silverman, also would not comment on why he did not get such a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Scarpa's late father, Gregory Scarpa Sr., was a ruthless Mafia
murderer at the same time that he was also a longtime informer for
the FBI against the mob.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As Silverman questioned his client as he testified in his own
defense, he suggested that he had hoped that his actions in
cooperating with the government would get him leniency in his own
case.
</P>
<P>
   Scarpa, 47, also told the jury that he had passed on information
from the inmates that other terrorists ``were on their way'' to the
1996 Olympic games in Atlanta to check out the security for a
possible bomb attack there, but his testimony did not indicate that
they were responsible for the bomb that did explode there, killing
one person. Federal authorities have most recently linked that
bombing to a fugitive they are seeking, Eric Robert Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   Scarpa has admitted that he is a member of the Mafia's Colombo
crime family, as his father was, though he denies the murder
charges he is accused of.
</P>
<P>
   His father, who died in 1994, had said that as part of his work
for the FBI, he had terrorized a Ku Klux Klan member into
disclosing where the bodies of three civil rights workers were
buried after they had been slain in Mississippi in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, his son testified that ``senior,'' as he referred to
his father, had told him that he had obtained the information by
putting a gun in the Klan member's mouth and saying, ``I'll blow
your head off.''

EDITORIAL: SAVING LIVES IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Oct. 14:
</P>
<P>
   Peace and reconciliation are not coming to Kosovo, but at least
the displacement and killing of civilians may abate under an
agreement reached with Slobodan Milosevic. The deal, arranged by
Richard Holbrooke, the American envoy, can save lives if it is
vigorously enforced by the United States and its European allies.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the threat of NATO air strikes, Milosevic agreed to
observe a cease-fire, withdraw many of his brutal special forces
from Kosovo and allow unarmed observers and NATO overflights to
monitor the agreement. If honored by Serbian forces, which will be
difficult to assure, these steps can allow tens of thousands of
ethnic Albanians now hiding in the forests and hills to return to
their villages. With Serbian guns silent, international agencies
can provide food and other aid desperately needed as winter
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   That was Washington's main objective, and the justification for
authorizing NATO military action if Milosevic persisted with his
terror campaign in Kosovo. Achieving that goal without bombing
would be a diplomatic victory.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has often broken his commitments. In this case, his
assent to NATO monitoring flights over Serbia can help provide the
means for early detection and swift retaliation for any Serbian
violations of the accord. The murderous police forces that he will
be permitted to keep in Kosovo must not be allowed to leave their
barracks. In the absence of intermediate mechanisms to enforce the
accord, NATO must remain ready to conduct air strikes if Milosevic
breaks the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   NATO vigilance will also be required because the 2,000 ground
observers assembled to check Serbian compliance will be provided by
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The group,
which includes nearly all European countries, lacks the unity and
spine to deal effectively with the Serbs, and commands no military
forces. It is also regrettable that Milosevic refuses to recognize
the jurisdiction of the war crimes tribunal seeking to investigate
possible crimes by Serbian forces, which could deter further
atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   The Holbrooke agreement rightly does not try to settle the
question of Kosovo's political future, which will require complex
negotiations. Washington and its allies will need to find ways
short of military action to press Milosevic to restore the large
degree of autonomy the province enjoyed before his assault on its
people began in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is incorrigible, and Washington has gained only a
respite from his abuse and atrocities. Even as he retreats in
Kosovo, his men have threatened the lives of independent
journalists, scholars and politicians in Serbia who question his
autocratic rule. But the killing and intimidation may stop in
Kosovo _ at least for now.

 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ John Cleghorn showed what a formidable competitor he
could be when he played center on the McGill University football
team that won the intercollegiate championship in 1960. Now that he
is chairman of the Royal Bank of Canada, the country's largest, and
campaigning vigorously for government approval to make it a lot
larger by merging with the Bank of Montreal, he is acting as though
he still thinks no one can get past him.
</P>
<P>
   From the look of things, however, he will need all the grit he
can muster. Strongly backed by public opinion, the government
remains uncertain about allowing the Royal-Montreal deal or mergers
by any other of the country's top five banks, which, with 93
percent of the industry's assets, dominate the banking sector to an
extent unmatched anywhere else in the world.
</P>
<P>
   While focusing on the Royal's consolidation, Cleghorn also plugs
the other proposed big-bank merger, between the Canadian Imperial
Bank of Commerce, the second-largest, and the Toronto Dominion
Bank, the fourth-largest. His argument is the same: Being bigger
will make the banks better able to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to play in the big leagues, you've got to be
equipped,'' said Cleghorn, 57, who turned down a chance to play for
a professional Canadian football team.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even in the league of the big banks, Cleghorn faces a
potential deal blocker: Peter Godsoe, president of Scotiabank, the
smallest of the five roughly equal-sized major banks and the only
one not pursuing a merger.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Scotiabank was considered highly likely to join
another bank, and Godsoe acknowledges that he held preliminary
discussions with possible partners. It is not clear why a deal did
not materialize, but now that Scotiabank is the odd man out, Godsoe
is on a campaign every bit as evangelical as Cleghorn's.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no case to support the megamergers,'' Godsoe said in
a speech in Toronto last month. He estimates that 1,000 branches
will be closed and more than 20,000 jobs lost if both sets of big
banks merge. ``They would eliminate one-third of our country's
banking system,'' he said, ``and increase concentration to levels
not seen anywhere else in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleghorn disputes that and accuses Godsoe of ignoring credit
unions and other institutions that have a significant share of
Canadian finances in provinces such as Quebec and Saskatchewan. He
said that Godsoe had opposed the mergers only since Scotiabank was
left without a partner. ``It's the old game of musical chairs,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   That game does not seem to be playing well with most Canadians.
Much as they love the stability of their banking system _ only two
banks have failed since the Depression _ Canadians hate the rich
and powerful big banks and their record profits, polls show. Many
consider them hopelessly conservative and pampered by laws that
limit international competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``People resent the banks because they have to put up with poor
service and high charges,'' said John Nunziata, an independent
member of Parliament from Toronto who is no friend of banks
himself. ``They feel like these big banks don't care about the
little guy.''
</P>
<P>
   All five big banks are based in Toronto. Canada has only six
other banks, and all of them are local and comparatively small. In
short, the system is far different from the United States, which
has roughly 10,000 banks, many of which are larger than the
Canadian banks but usually dominate only their local or regional
market. And the five largest American banks control only 19
percent, not 93 percent, of the nation's overall banking assets.
</P>
<P>
   The regulatory process differs markedly, too. With banking a
national responsibility in Canada's constitution, government
involvement in the two proposed mergers will be substantial and
time-consuming. The Royal and the Bank of Montreal made their
merger plans known in January and a decision by Ottawa is still
several months off. By comparison, Citicorp and Travelers Group,
which announced plans in April to form the world's largest
financial services company, have already merged after receiving
Washington's approval.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of all five Canadian big banks have become well
known, but it is the husky Cleghorn who has taken the lead, logging
thousands of miles in a public relations campaign that makes him
appear to be everywhere, speaking to whoever will listen about the
benefits that he says would flow from allowing Royal and the Bank
of Montreal to merge. With a combined market capitalization of more
than $33 billion (in U.S. dollars), the new entity would be the
eighth-largest bank in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Cleghorn and the other merging bankers argue that in a world of
consolidation, it is essential to have sufficient scale. Reflecting
similar concerns, a wave of mergers in the United States and Europe
has turned other banks into mega-institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Cleghorn says these mergers are altering the dynamics of the
financial sector so fast that it is almost impossible to keep pace.
The proposed Royal-Montreal consolidated bank has slipped from 17th
to 22nd place in world rankings just since the deal was proposed in
January.
</P>
<P>
   And Cleghorn thinks the banks need to be bigger to compete
domestically against the more than 2,200 provincial credit unions
and 78 mutual funds that hold an increasing share of personal
assets, as well as the mutual funds and specialized credit card
companies from the United States that are also siphoning away some
of the big banks' traditional customers.
</P>
<P>
   Cleghorn sees the merger as only the start of his drive to make
the Royal globally competitive. He envisions the new combined bank
serving as a platform from which to stage future ventures.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Montreal is already spread across North America. It
owns the Harris Bank of Chicago and has an equity stake in the
Mexican bank Bancomer. And it spent $20 million (U.S.) recently to
acquire the Security First Network Bank in Atlanta, a virtual bank
with 17,000 customers that operates on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a building game for North America,'' Cleghorn said.

 TORONTO: Cleghorn said. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Standing in the way of the planned merger is an unwritten
practice of the Canadian government that ``big shall not buy big.''
Though it is not a formal regulation or law, the presumption that
such mergers would not be approved in Ottawa has until now
forestalled any attempts. Foreign banks are effectively kept from
taking over Canadian institutions by a rule that puts a 10 percent
limit on the amount of bank stock that any individual or company
can own.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, federal laws permit banks to be truly national, with
branches from coast to coast. At the turn of the century there were
dozens of banks, but by 1933 a wave of consolidation had already
reduced the number to 10. As the rise of the credit unions and
mutual funds shows, however, Canadians no longer rely solely on the
national banks.
</P>
<P>
   Mergers have to be reviewed by Canada's Competition Bureau and
cannot go through until they are approved by the minister of
finance, currently Paul Martin, who has just received a
long-awaited study on the future of Canada's financial sector.
</P>
<P>
   That report, prepared by a task force headed by Harold MacKay, a
Saskatchewan lawyer, did not deal with specific mergers, but it
gave a cautious go-ahead for such consolidations if they meet
certain standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recommend a public interest review process to assess
mergers of large financial institutions,'' MacKay said in a recent
speech. ``Careful and disciplined case-by-case review should take
place.''
</P>
<P>
   The MacKay report recommended that competition be increased by
giving foreign banks greater freedom to operate in Canada and by
allowing credit unions to expand beyond their provincial
boundaries, in effect creating a ``second tier'' of banks.
</P>
<P>
   It also made recommendations that some bankers consider
intrusive, such as requiring all financial institutions to report
annually to Parliament on their contributions to the communities in
which they work. The government should apply sanctions against
financial institutions that do not honor public commitments on such
things as keeping branches open and protecting jobs, the task force
said.
</P>
<P>
   The big banks are already signaling that they will do what it
takes to get approval for the mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Cleghorn told a parliamentary commission that the merged banks
would guarantee in writing that layoffs would be minimal. He
conceded that up to 9,200 positions would overlap, but he said most
cuts would be taken care of through attrition. Cleghorn also
promised that rural Canada would not lose branch service as a
result of the merger.
</P>
<P>
   But it appears that the fate of the mergers will not be decided
solely on local or global financial reasoning, no matter how sound.
Since regulation throws the issue into the hands of the government,
it is expected ultimately to be a political decision, based as much
on sentiment as dollars and cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The banking sector doesn't seem to be doing anything to make
banking services more available or user-friendly,'' John Gerretson,
a local legislator and former mayor of Kingston, Ontario, said when
Cleghorn met with a group of local leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that one reason people are against the mergers is
that the average Joe on the street thinks he is less well served
than he was before,'' Gerretson said. Branch hours have been
reduced and service charges have gone up, he added, and it has
become almost impossible for customers to find somebody to talk to
inside most branches.
</P>
<P>
   Cleghorn, who has heard such criticism before, responded by
talking about how traditional banking _ the kind of personal
transaction involving a teller and a customer that Gerretson
described _ now accounts for only about 11 percent of a bank's
business, compared with 80 percent two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he said, most cash transactions are done at automatic
teller machines. Telephone banking and Internet services are
growing rapidly, and Canadians have taken heavily to using debit
cards, which deduct purchases directly from the card holders' bank
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason branch hours are shrinking is because customer
demand is shrinking,'' Cleghorn said.
</P>
<P>
   While that may not be true of older customers used to
traditional services, Cleghorn insisted that change was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The status quo is finished in our planning processes,'' he
said.

COWBOYS' JONES TALKS OF RE-SIGNING NEWTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Clarence E. Hill Jr. and Kevin Lyons 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said yesterday that
the team is so pleased with guard Nate Newton's play and
conditioning that they will try to re-sign him in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   There was much talk after the Washington game Oct. 4 about how
the Cowboys wore down the Redskins' $57 million defensive-tackle
combo of Dana Stubblefield and Dan Wilkinson, who both looked tired
and out of shape in the fourth quarter. One of the players
responsible for wearing them out was the 36-year-old Newton, who
was supposedly so old and out of shape last year that the Cowboys
forced him to get him in shape. At 318 pounds, Newton is 52 pounds
under last season's playing weight of 370. He can become a free
agent after this season.
Davis unlikely to play
Wide receiver Billy Davis most likely will not play Sunday against
the Chicago Bears because of a strained left foot, coach Chan
Gailey said. Davis will be replaced in the starting lineup by Ernie
Mills.  &LR; name:_ Clarence E. Hill Jr.
More Deion on offense
Gailey said wide receiver/cornerback/punt returner Deion Sanders
will get more work on offense in practice this week and during the
bye week after Sunday's game against Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said he wants Sanders, who has played primarily in the
four-receiver sets, to get more time in the two- and three-receiver
packages. Teams can't load up on receiver Michael Irvin with
Sanders in the game, Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders has caught four passes for 71 yards in the past four
games.  &LR; name:_ Kevin Lyons

ADVERTISING: COENS SPOOF TV PROGRAMMING IN HONDA MINIVAN SPOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANDREA ADELSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Viewers of television shows like ``The Practice'' and ``Law and
Order'' may be momentarily confused next month when American Honda
Motor Co. starts a $50 million advertising campaign for its new
Odyssey minivan.
</P>
<P>
   One of the ad's scene-setting shots is intended to be mistaken
for network programming. A group of soberly dressed, gray-haired
lawyers are bargaining over the competing interests of their
clients in a book-lined room. The surprise comes from the
antagonists' unusual demands and who their clients turn out to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your offer to give my clients reading lights would be
acceptable,'' one lawyer says, peering over the top of his reading
glasses. ``If they could read.'' The camera turns on two girls in
ponytails and jumpers, doodling on legal pads.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar 30-second spot, a voice-over says, ``My client
doesn't think we need a third seat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Objection,'' replies a lawyer in a pinstriped suit, his hair
slicked back. ``My client sleeps back there.'' As if signaling
agreement, a large dog seated at the table wags his tail.
</P>
<P>
   The ads are intended to convey the attributes of Honda's
redesigned full-sized minivan in an entertaining way, said Gerry
Rubin, president and chief executive of  &UR; Rubin Postaer &AMP;
Associates &LR;  in Santa Monica, Calif. About half of the agency's $500
million in billings are for Honda, a unit of  &UR; Honda Motor &LR;  Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first frames, if you show a car, you run the risk of
turning off the viewer,'' Rubin said. ``We don't think we run that
risk with these ads.''
</P>
<P>
   The spots are a calculated attempt to fool the viewer into
believing they are seeing an extension of regular programming. It
is a slickly convincing effort in part because the actor-lawyers
are near archetypes, handpicked by Joel and Ethan Coen, the film
makers who were hired to produce the spots. The film-making
siblings have an eye for character selection, making a pregnant
police chief the lead role in their Oscar-winning film ``Fargo.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coen brothers previously produced spots for the Honda Accord
that spoofed movies.
</P>
<P>
   The two TV spots for the Odyssey are to be shown beginning Nov.
2 in the top 30 markets. Besides shows about lawyers, where the
ads' story lines seem environmentally appropriate, Honda is also
buying time during ``ER,'' ``Frasier,'' the Fox Family Channel and
the Disney Channel. Two more spots are being finished and prepared
for broadcast during the Super Bowl on Jan. 25.
</P>
<P>
   The six-month campaign also includes displays of the vehicle at
the nation's 10 largest airports, except for O'Hare International
in Chicago. Terminal doors were not big enough to accommodate the
75.6-inch Odyssey. Ad pages will also be bought in 15 magazines,
including Time, Business Week and Golf Life, where Honda
traditionally places ads, but also life-style titles like Good
Housekeeping, Family Life and Parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would not find these on a typical Honda schedule,'' Rubin
said. Honda is trying to broaden its reach to more women and
customers who would normally buy domestic models. Over all, Honda's
share of the U.S. auto market is 8.1 percent. It sold 993,540 cars
in 1998, an 8 percent increase compared with 1997 sales.

   The Odyssey, to be priced between $23,200 and $25,800, has a V6
engine and is the largest car ever made by Honda. Two years ago, a
more compact four-cylinder version built in Japan received a
lukewarm reception. It was seen as costly compared with full-sized
domestic competitors. Honda's 1999 Odyssey is comparably equipped
in size, power and features to domestic rivals like the Ford
Windstar and Dodge Caravan.
</P>
<P>
   Honda is a latecomer to the minivan party. Minivan sales are no
longer growing at racing speed as they did in the 1980s. Sales
total about 1.2 million a year. Even so, automakers are still
trying to lure minivan buyers with more features, like dual sliding
doors and improved performance.
</P>
<P>
   Odyssey sales will initially be constrained to 60,000 a year by
production capacity at Honda's new plant in Alliston, Ontario.
Honda sold 27,000 of the old Odyssey model in 1996, 20,000 in 1997
and has sold 12,600 so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Months before the Odyssey went on sale, the automaker kicked on
its marketing machinery. About 123,000 people who filled out reply
cards at auto shows or asked for minivan information on line
received Odyssey brochures. An additional 30,000 prospects, who
said they intended to buy a minivan in the next six months,
received a CD-ROM where the minivan's considerable features are
displayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew the product was coming and we tried to keep people out
of the market,'' said Paul Sellers, Honda's national advertising
manager. A similar strategy worked successfully when Honda
introduced the Passport, its sport utility vehicle, which now
outsells Toyota's RAV-4. ``Keeping people out of the market for a
van is harder,'' he said. ``It's a segment dominated by domestic
automakers where Honda has never before been a serious
contender.'' &QL;

REPUBLICANS ARE IRKED AT INDUSTRY GROUP'S HIRING OF DEMOCRAT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JILL ABRAMSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an aggressive push to enforce greater Republican
loyalty among Washington lobbying groups, Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas,
has urged the Electronic Industries Alliance to reconsider its
hiring of a Democrat to serve as president.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, the majority whip, raised his displeasure over the hiring
of Dave McCurdy, a former Democratic representative from Oklahoma,
by the electronics industry trade group with House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., and again at a meeting of the House Republican
leadership last Friday, two Republican aides said.
</P>
<P>
   McCurdy's hiring also peeved several other Republican leaders,
including Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas and Rep. John Linder,
the Georgian who heads the National Republican Congressional
Committee, said the two aides and Roll Call, the Capitol Hill
newspaper, which first reported on the issue. McCurdy lost a Senate
race four years ago and has since been a lobbyist for clients in
the electronics industry.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Linder and other Republican leaders contacted
members of the trade group's board in an effort to pressure the
group, which represents 2,100 electronics companies, into rejected
McCurdy as its incoming president.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Rosenker, the group's vice president for public affairs,
said McCurdy was selected after a five-month search by a
professional executive search firm. The selection was announced
last week, after the group interviewed many candidates, including
incumbent members of Congress from both parties, Rosenker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To hire a Democrat to represent this group before a current
Republican majority and what is certain to be a larger majority is
not a shrewd business decision,'' said Michael Scanlon, an aide to
DeLay.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, who has been the House
leadership's liaison to lobbying groups in Washington, was furious
over DeLay's tactics with the electronics association, a Republican
aide said. Boehner has been a leader in efforts to pressure such
lobbying groups to hire Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Boehner's dispute with DeLay over McCurdy was seen as fresh
evidence by some Republicans of heightened tensions within the GOP
House leadership ranks.
</P>
<P>
   While a few member companies have expressed concerns over the
Republican antipathy over McCurdy's hiring, Rosenker said his trade
association would not reconsider its offer for a job that pays a
generous six-figure salary and involves far more than lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our president serves as a spokesman for a $500 billion
industry,'' said Rosenker, a Republican who once worked for
President Gerald Ford. ``We believe that Dave McCurdy will be a
very articulate and effective spokesman.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's former president, who served for 21 years, was a
registered independent, Rosenker said, adding, ``We've had a
wonderful relationship with Congress during that whole time with
both sides of the aisle and both Republican and Democratic
administrations.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the electronics group were gathered in Phoenix for
their annual fall conference, where McCurdy made his first speech
as its president Tuesday without mentioning the dispute over his
hiring.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the group were concerned that DeLay and other
Republican leaders might block approval of intellectual property
legislation, one member said. But the bill passed the House
Tuesday.

KODAK LEARNS HOW UNFORGIVING INVESTORS CAN BE THESE DAYS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A bull market might have taken it as good news. The
Eastman Kodak Co. Tuesday reported third-quarter earnings of $398
million, up nearly 72 percent from the quarter last year, and a
penny ahead of analyst forecasts. It was way ahead of schedule on
its cost-cutting campaign. It had stopped the cash hemorrhage from
its portfolio of digital products.
</P>
<P>
   Yet investors reacted as though they had been kicked in the
stomach. Kodak's shares plummeted $11.1875, or more than 13
percent, to $72.375.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: Kodak's earnings may have been up, but its revenues
declined. In a jittery market, good news whispers, bad news shouts.
</P>
<P>
   The strong negative reaction astounded most analysts. ``Anyone
who looked for top-line growth in 1998 simply doesn't understand
the Kodak story,'' said Rebecca F. Runkle, an analyst with Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter. ``You buy Kodak for its cost-cutting
initiatives and its ability to drive earnings growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many analysts sympathize with the investors' angst.
``Kodak is doing the right things, but they can't force growth,''
said B. Alexander Henderson, an analyst with Prudential Securities
Research.
</P>
<P>
   Patience is scarce on Wall Street these days, added Jonathan
Rosenzweig, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. ``The thesis on
Kodak has always been, `They'll cut costs today, grow top line
tomorrow,''' he said. ``Investors are wondering how far away
tomorrow really is.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, no one was cutting Kodak any slack. News that could be
viewed as a glass half-full was seen as a sign of one in dire need
of a refill.
</P>
<P>
   An example: during a conference call with analysts, Kodak's
chief financial officer, Harry Kavetas, said that the company would
spend about $100 million for employee bonuses in 1998. A bull
market might have agreed that Kodak's robust earnings entitled
employees, many of whom received no bonuses last year, to a share
of the pie. Instead, analysts reacted simply to an unanticipated
hit of 20 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's yet another cost we never thought would be in there,''
Rosenzweig said.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of glumness cast a pall over all Kodak's bright
earnings numbers. The company reported net earnings of $398
million, or $1.21 a share, on revenue of $3.42 billion. Its profit
from operations as a percentage of sales rose to 18.5 percent, from
11.5 percent a year ago. And it said it had reduced annual costs by
$650 million, $150 million more than its target for the year as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many stocks can you think of where you know you're going
to get at least a 20 percent earnings increase just on
cost-cutting?'' asked Ulysses Yannas, an analyst with Mercer,
Bokert, Buckman &AMP; Reid.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that could compensate for revenue that fell nearly
10 percent. Overseas, sales dropped by 17 percent, or $231 million,
to $1.8 billion. The slide was dizzyingly steep in emerging markets
_ an area that Kodak has historically counted on for its fastest
growth. Sales were down by 55 percent in Russia, 22 percent in
China, 33 percent in South Korea. ``The emerging markets got a lot
dicier than we thought,'' Kavetas said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did domestic sales, which fell by $106 million, to $1.59
billion, provide much succor. In the United States, sales of film,
Kodak's highest-margin product by far, was down by 10 percent. Even
motion-picture film, which Mr. Kavetas has always called a star
performer, showed its first sign of weakness in several years. ``We
didn't lose share,'' he said. ``People are making fewer movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the domestic numbers are not as somber as they look.
Kodak sold its retail film stores last year, cutting out a chunk of
revenues. It shifted about $80 million in revenue to a joint
venture, Kodak Polychrome Graphics. Changes in the way it accounts
for promotional expenditures caused another $52 million hit.
</P>
<P>
   Even the shortfall in film sales may have been temporary, caused
by retailers miscalculating demand and overstocking the previous
quarter. ``Retailers order too much film; they work off their
inventory; they order again,'' said Jack Kelly, an analyst with
Goldman, Sachs. ``This has been Kodak's story forever.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most important, Kodak is addressing its sales slump
head-on. The company invested more than $700 million in China this
year., putting up plants that can import huge spools of film _ at
lower tariffs than sales-ready rolls _ and split them into rolls
that can be sold at cut-rate prices. At home, Kodak recently
contracted to buy Imation's medical imaging business. And, Kodak
continues to invest heavily in a ``digitization strategy,'' an
attempt to use digital technology to bolster conventional
photography sales. For example, Kodak has teamed up with America
Online and Intel to enable consumers to receive their processed
photographs in digital form.
</P>
<P>
   For now, these are all net costs. But Kodak assumes they will
soon yield robust sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We delivered less top-line growth than even we had expected,''
Kavetas said. ``Now we are going to turn the big guns onto the
initiatives that drive top-line growth.''

 &HT;    Judge McCown is making his mark in public service
 &HT;    By Denise Gamino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Scott McCown has left his legal imprint on
solutions to some of the most vexing social problems faced by Texas
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   First it was the prison system. Next, institutions for people
with mental retardation. Then the funding of public school
districts in Texas. Now, it's abused and neglected children.
</P>
<P>
   He was pulled to the bull's eye of history by a legal mind
nurtured by his U.S. attorney father and a heart that took him to
the doorstep of the seminary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got into the Candler School of Theology at (Atlanta's) Emory
and I got into the School of Law at the University of Texas,'' he
said. ``I got the acceptance letters in the same week.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And the devil won.''
</P>
<P>
   McCown, that rare 43-year-old who still has a round baby face,
speaks softly but carries a big personal measuring stick. He uses
it to gauge what he believes is a key moral standard: ``How you
take care of people.'' This fifth-generation Texanwants Texas to
provide a standard of care high enough to meet his values.
</P>
<P>
   McCown seems to never let up. He is an overachiever who finished
college in three years and doesn't mind fortifying himself with
Diet Coke until 2 a.m. to write plans for reshaping Texas. He
teaches Sunday school at his Methodist church and is raising a son
and daughter with his wife Maura Powers, an assistant attorney
general.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, McCown was an assistant Texas attorney general
who was put in charge of the long-running federal lawsuit
challenging conditions in state prisons. He helped fashion a
settlement agreement to reduce crowding and improve medical care
and other services for inmates.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, McCown was one of the assistant attorneys general who
tried to guide the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental
Retardation through a bitter class-action lawsuit that exposed
shortcomings in state institutions. In one hearing, no-nonsense
U.S. District Court Judge Barefoot Sanders of Dallas challenged
many of McCown's arguments on behalf of the state, but McCown never
lost his composure.
</P>
<P>
   The very next year, McCown had more in common with Sanders than
the state officials he once defended. McCown became a state
district judge, winning his first try for a seat on the bench in
Travis County.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he was presiding over the controversial public school
finance case that threatened to halt state aid to all 1,058 school
districts in Texas. McCown pushed the Legislature to devise a
system for equalizing funding between rich and poor public school
districts. For five years, McCown presided over the case, which
prompted the Legislature to pass a law requiring the wealthiest
Texas school districts to share some local property tax revenue
with the poorest districts.
</P>
<P>
   Behind all the hearings and headlines about school funding,
McCown quietly became an expert on a part of law he never even
studied in law school: family law, and the care and guardianship of
abused and neglected children.
</P>
<P>
   With record numbers of child abuse cases flooding the docket in
Travis County, McCown and fellow state district Judge Jeanne Meurer
volunteered in 1992 to split all the cases in which a judge must
determine whether abused children stay with their families or go
into foster care. Now, McCown spends every Friday doing nothing but
these Child Protective Services cases.
</P>
<P>
   McCown estimates he has presided over 1,400 cases involving
2,500 children who were abused or neglected.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you asked me what's the most important thing you do, this
is it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He even bought a home computer to research and write the
graduate school thesis-like report for his new one-man crusade on
behalf of overlooked children.
</P>
<P>
   This unprecedented report once again propels McCown to the
forefront of a Texas crisis. ``What I couldn't live with myself on
is not having spoken up,'' he said. ``It wasn't somebody else's
responsibility. It was as much my responsibility as anybody
else's.''

 &HT;    MacKay cites cash stash in debate with Bush
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley and Shirish Date
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Talking about suitcases filled with cash and a
felon who fled with $200 million, Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay took every
opportunity Tuesday during his second statewide debate with Jeb
Bush to say that Bush's business background is at best
questionable.
</P>
<P>
   After the debate MacKay admitted that he does not have specific
information that Bush has done anything improper but he insists
that Bush is not telling everything he knows about his business
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   In a rapid response, Bush's press secretary was passing out
rebuttal information to reporters while the debate was still under
way. During the debate, Bush rebuked MacKay for what he said were
unfounded charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this what it's gotten down to?'' Bush asked as his
supporters jeered MacKay. ``Is this what it's gotten down to? Gross
distortions? Gross distortions of facts that have already been
written about by every major newspaper?''
</P>
<P>
   The hourlong radio debate was broadcast by the Florida Radio
Network from a stage at the Disney Institute and aired live by 33
stations. The audience was overwhelmingly pro-Bush, and several
quietly held small Jeb! bumper stickers.
</P>
<P>
   Questions were asked by a panel of journalists and audience
members chosen at random.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay, who won the coin toss and chose to speak after Bush,
went on the offensive almost immediately, rattling off the names of
Bush's former business partners and the various deals that MacKay
hopes will become the focal point of the race's final three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's never been involved in a school board, he's never been
involved in a city or county commission. He says: Look at my
business record. And I say, yes, look at his business record. It's
very different from what he portrays,'' MacKay said. ``His business
record is one of questionable deals, it is one of mismanagement.
And I think people really ought to look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   MacKay also tried to make the most of Bush's career as a Miami
land developer, and asked voters whether they really wanted to
trust Florida's fragile environment with such a man.
</P>
<P>
   Bush countered that he had no problem letting voters rate him
based on his two decades in private business. ``The fact that I
would be a developer all of a sudden has an evil connotation,''
Bush said. ``I'm quite proud of the fact that our business, which
started with two people in 1980, has grown to have 200 employees,
200 families that are involved in activities that are providing
quality growth that pays for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush in his answers tried to push the debate toward the themes
he has worked on all summer, including education, prevention of
drug abuse _ ``The drug problem is a quiet poison in our
community'' _ law enforcement and economic development.
</P>
<P>
   As in the previous debate, Bush touted his plan to test each
public school, rewarding those that excel or improve while
``holding accountable'' those that don't. And, as he has for the
past several weeks, he tried to downplay his support of vouchers _
or scholarships, as he prefers to call them _ as only a last resort
for a limited number of poor children stuck in chronically bad
schools.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time before a large audience, though, Bush did
allow that he would indeed consider expanding vouchers to more
students. ``If it works, and there is broad consensus that we could
build on that, I would consider it, absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, though, MacKay would return to Bush's business
dealings, calling for thorough explanations. On a question about
HMOs, MacKay veered off onto the topic of Miguel Recarey, a felon
who stole $200 million from Medicare and fled to Spain. Bush, with
his father in Washington, called a federal agency on Recarey's
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he did not know of Recarey's criminal history, nor
did he help the man commit a crime.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay also questioned Bush's role with Jacksonville-based
Ideon, a credit card services company that went belly-up when Bush
was on the board of directors. Bush has said he didn't know the
company was in so much trouble when he took the position.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay's most aggressive attack, though, came on a partnership
Bush entered with a Deerfield Beach man, David Eller, whose company
was trying to sell water pumps to Nigeria. MacKay asked Bush to
explain why the pilot of one of the planes that once flew Bush to
Africa told The Miami Herald that he saw suitcases full of cash
taken there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pilot said there were five suitcases, they were heavy, one
of them opened and it was full of cash. Don't you think that Jeb
ought to give an answer for that?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush on Tuesday did have an answer: It's all hogwash. ``I mean
this thing about money, suitcases, planes . . . I mean, come on.
This stuff's crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and MacKay meet at 7 p.m. Tuesday for their final statewide
television debate before the November election. The debate will be
broadcast on NBC stations throughout Florida.

 &HT;    Judge sends out report on Texas' child protection system
 &HT;    By Denise Gamino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The world never knew Nakia Cole, a 6-week-old
boy who bled to death last year in an Austin house so squalid that
cockroaches had taken over the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Nakia lived just a mile from the Capitol with eight other
children, one of whom was his teen-age mother. He died in a crib
after his infected lungs hemorrhaged, possibly from a virus from
the feces of rats that overran the dilapidated house.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny boy died in obscurity just two weeks before Austin was
shocked by the Oct. 14 discovery of 9-year-old Victoria Barr, who
lived liked a prisoner in a rat-infested house in the trendy
Clarksville neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to Nakia and Victoria still brings tears to the
eyes of Travis County state District Judge Scott McCown, who
oversees the placement of abused and neglected children into safe
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem has grown and grown and grown, and Child
Protective Services' performance is the worst in a decade,'' McCown
said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, McCown has turned his outrage into a manifesto.
</P>
<P>
   Using a citizen's grievance procedure outlined in the Texas
Constitution, McCown today is delivering an unusual petition to
Gov. George W. Bush and the Legislature. In it, he details with
charts and graphs a child welfare system buckling under a crushing
workload and calls for more state resources to ease the strain. Jim
Hine, executive director of the Texas Department of Protective and
Regulatory Services, says he has no argument with the findings or
the recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   McCown recommends that two cents of every dollar from the
state's anticipated multibillion-dollar surplus be earmarked for
abused and neglected children.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the judge's report arrived, a spokeswoman for the
governor said that if Bush wins re-election, he will seek more
money from the next Legislature for Child Protective Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush agrees with Judge McCown that we need to do more,''
said his spokeswoman Linda Edwards. McCown estimates his two-penny
formula would put an additional $200 million into the Department of
Protective and Regulatory Services, which runs Child Protective
Services, and several other agencies with programs for abused and
neglected children.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are too few investigators and too many cases,'' he said.
``That results in cases that need to be investigated not getting
investigated, cases that are investigated being inadequately
investigated, and children who need help not getting help.''
</P>
<P>
   McCown has devoted countless hours over the past year
researching and writing an unprecedented document he titled: ``A
Petition in Behalf of the Forsaken Children of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every citizen has the right to petition their governor and
their Legislature for the redress of their grievances,'' McCown
said. ``If a kid dies because we know the system is overwhelmed and
we don't have enough people on the job and we know that, then that
is my responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 42-page report, McCown points out that the number of
abuse and neglect investigations is at a five-year low and that the
per capita investigation rate is at an eight-year low.
</P>
<P>
   McCown also notes that Texas falls far below the national
average in handling child abuse cases. Texas child abuse
investigators carry an average of 27 cases each while the Child
Welfare League of America recommends a caseload of 12 cases per
investigator.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case for action is overwhelming,'' he writes. ``Since
1985, the state's investigations of child abuse and neglect have
deteriorated in both number and quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the population of children in Texas has increased 16
percent from 1985-98, to more than 5.5 million, the number of
children found to be abused or neglected fell 28 percent in that
same period, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decline is not attributable to better lives for children
in 1998 as compared to 1985; instead, the decline is attributable
to less resources for investigations by the Child Protective
Service,'' McCown writes.
</P>
<P>
   State leaders have estimated that Texas may have a budget
surplus of $3 billion to $6 billion in the 2000-2001budget period.
McCown said his state government sources say the budget surplus
will be closer to $8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Other constituencies already are lining up to try to get part of
the windfall.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Democratic
Rep. Rob Junell of San Angelo, said lawmakers will have to weigh
all needs along with the shortcomings in the child protection
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably we need to put some money into it,'' he said. But,
``We'll consider it as we do all other requests for funding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we could make a case that higher education is
underfunded, that health and human services is underfunded, that
public education is underfunded, that the Department of Public
Safety is underfunded,'' he said. ``Highways. They're saying they
are underfunded. It's a question of taking resources and
distributing them in a reasonable manner.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998-99, Child Protective Services is operating with $990
million, more than half of which pays for residential services such
as foster care. The agency has requested a two-year budget of
$1.067 billion, again with most of it to pay for residential care.
</P>
<P>
   But Hine, the protective and regulatory services director, said
the budget increase would not be enough to reduce caseloads.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you triple the number of kids in care, what (McCown) is
saying is that the percentage of time that our staff spends on kids
in care has had to increase, and as a result, something has had to
suffer. His conclusion is that investigations are what suffered,''
Hine said. ``I think he's made a correct analysis of that.''
</P>
<P>
   McCown's report shows that in 1985, the state had 2,252 workers
to help 8,806 children, of whom 5,226 were in foster care. By 1997,
the state had 4,437 workers to care for 23,595 children, with
17,485 of them in foster care.
</P>
<P>
   Although the state received no reports of neglect in Nakia's
case, records cited by McCown show that Child Protective Service
workers received 10 reports about neglect of children in the East
Austin home in the three years before he was born, one six months
before his birth.
</P>
<P>
   Hine acknowledged that children will slip through the cracks as
long as workers remain overloaded. But he said a death like Nakia's
is ``the exception rather than the rule.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got to tell you that with over 100,000 investigations a
year, we're going to have cases where that happens,'' Hine said.
``I don't like it. I think it's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, you have workers who are overloaded with
investigation caseloads. And when you have that happen, there's an
occasional problem that occurs and it's unfortunate that in this
business, when it happens it can have really tragic results.''
</P>
<P>
   Highlights of report Findings
</P>
<P>
   Texas investigated only 60 percent of child abuse and neglect
allegations in 1997-98, the lowest rate in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Staff per 1,000 children in state custody has declined 24
percent since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Average caseload for Texas child abuse investigator _ 27.
Average caseload recommended by Child Welfare League of America _
12.
</P>
<P>
   Number of investigations that confirm abuse or neglect has
dropped from 56 percent to 28 percent since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Texas ranked 30th among 35 states reporting data on removing
children from abusive or neglectful homes in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   1997 survey found one in four Texans witnessed an incident of
child abuse or neglect in past year.
</P>
<P>
   1.8 children per every 1,000 Texas children were in state
custody in 1985. In 1997, 4.3 children for every 1,000 children
were in state custody.
</P>
<P>
   Recommendations:
</P>
<P>
   _ Earmark 2 cents of every dollar in the Texas budget surplus
for abused and neglected children. With federal matching funds,
this could add $200 million to child protective services.
</P>
<P>
   _ First, increase money for prevention. Second, more money for
early intervention. Then, add to budget for finding permanent homes
for abused and neglected children.

 &HT;    Judge overturns previous ruling, says plan is legal
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The state's $763 million plan for cleaning up the
Everglades is legal, a federal judge ruled Tuesday _ weeks after
another judge decided the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler said he won't
necessarily give water managers until the end of 2006 to finish the
cleanup, as the state plan allows.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the sugar industry's pleas that he dismiss a
decade-old Everglades pollution lawsuit, Hoeveler said he intends
to watch over the cleanup as long as he must.
</P>
<P>
   Hoeveler also issued what some lawyers interpreted as a veiled
warning to state lawmakers against meddling in the cleanup. He said
he was ``mindful'' of two bills that Gov. Lawton Chiles vetoed last
spring after environmentalists claimed they would send restoration
costs soaring.
</P>
<P>
   The judge delayed deciding some of the most crucial questions
facing the cleanup, however. Among them: Is the Everglades really
suffering irreversible damage from sugar farm pollution, as
government scientists say? Or, is the pollution already declining,
as growers' researchers argue?
</P>
<P>
   The judge promised to schedule a hearing within a month to
consider that question. The hearing also would deal with the
proposed 2006 deadline and could address suggestions that he
appoint a federal overseer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no real surprise here,'' said Barbara Markham,
general counsel for the South Florida Water Management District,
the agency in charge of the cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists said they were elated. They said the judge
showed skepticism about the need for later cleanup deadlines, and
about the trustworthiness of state lawmakers to oversee the cleanup
on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good day for the Everglades,'' said Peter Antonacci, an
attorney for the Florida Audubon Society. ``He's not going to let
go of this case while the Florida legislature is hovering around
with great potential for mischief.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoeveler's rulings came a month after Chief U.S. District Judge
Edward Davis declared that the state's plan violated the federal
Clean Water Act by weakening anti-pollution rules. Davis didn't
overturn the state law but ordered federal regulators to scrutinize
it.
</P>
<P>
   Hoeveler upheld the same cleanup plan using a different
yardstick: the clause in the U.S. Constitution that prohibits
states from interfering with contracts. The Miccosukee Indian tribe
had argued that the plan clashes with an earlier promise by the
state to finish the cleanup in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Hoeveler acknowledged the conflict between the rulings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That presents a problem, doesn't it?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither judge is bound by the other's decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Hoeveler's ruling kept alive a 1988 lawsuit in which the federal
government accused the state of funneling polluted farm water into
the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   The suit prompted the state to enact a cleanup law in 1994. The
feds later asked Hoeveler to accept the law and its 2006 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Hoeveler also issued what he called a ``note of
warning'': He said future actions by state lawmakers could prove
illegal if they delay the cleanup, changing the leadership of the
project or ``unnecessarily increasing the cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Chiles vetoed two bills that environmentalists
claimed would force the state to pay more money for sugar farmland
needed for the cleanup, while allowing lawmakers to interfere with
federal restoration plans. Industry lobbyists said the measures
would protect small landowners and ensure the state a share in
crucial decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The cleanup plan is separate from a $7.8 billion federal
Everglades restoration proposal that Vice President Al Gore
unveiled Tuesday in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   That federal proposal is aimed at restoring natural flows to the
Everglades and ensuring South Florida's supply of drinking water by
the year 2050. It assumes that the state cleanup will have removed
the pollution by then.

 &HT;    Gore arrives in South Florida ready to raise funds
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Vice President Al Gore began his daylong trip
to South Florida Tuesday by downing a shot of vodka at a
conservative synagogue, then walking to a $5,000 a plate luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel less stiff already,'' Gore joked to about 150 members
at Temple Emanu-El. ``I've never been to a religious ceremony quite
like this before.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, accompanied by Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Boca Raton and New
Jersey Sen. Robert Torricelli, arrived in West Palm Beach about
10:40 a.m. for a day of Democratic money-raising events that
included lunch at the Palm Beach penthouse of S. Daniel Abraham,
founder of Slim-Fast Foods Co., followed by a reception and dinner
in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving, the vice president unveiled a $7.8 billion draft
plan to restore the Everglades by rebuilding South Florida water
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   While the plan received the biggest applause _ about 50
environmentalists gathered on the tarmac at Palm Beach
International Airport _ Gore spent most of his day hobnobbing with
Democratic elite at the luncheon. A block-long motorcade carried
the vice president on a route through downtown West Palm Beach,
drawing the attention of office workers and stopping traffic for
blocks, to the synagogue where members began celebrating Simchat
Torah at sundown Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The boisterous affair, which involves the imbibing of much
vodka, marks the day when Moses delivered the torah to the Jewish
people.
</P>
<P>
   Leonid Feldman, the popular rabbi who became the first Russian
Jew in America ordained in a conservative synagogue, welcomed the
vice president with a shot of kosher vodka, followed by a bite of
pickle and pumpernickel bread.
</P>
<P>
   Without mentioning the Monika Lewisky scandal, Feldman praised
Gore for standing by the president in troubling times. Gore, in
turn, praised the Jewish people for supporting his administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spirit of Israel is eternal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From the temple, Gore and his entourage walked a block with
Abraham _ who said he does not drive on the holiday _ to the Palm
Beach Biltmore.
</P>
<P>
   At the eighth-floor penthouse, where the floors are lined with
marble and walls with murals and stretched silk, a trio playing the
harp, cello and violin welcomed Gore (and even played the theme
from Titanic at one point). Fifty supporters seated around five
tables in a room overlooking Palm Beach and the Atlantic, just past
the home's ``north'' gym, mingled with the vice president during a
lunch of whitefish caviar, seared salmon and sorbet with biscotti.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Koch, wife of Palm Beach millionaire Bill Koch, sat to
Gore's left while Monte Friedkin, a generous contributor to the
party, sat to his right.
</P>
<P>
   Others at the lunch were Friedkin's wife, Skeets, Bill Koch,
attorney Mitchell Berger, Rep. Wexler, Torricelli, former U.S. Rep.
Wayne Owens, D-Utah and Rep. Elaine Bloom, D-Miami Beach. Abraham
began a string of introductions, that included Democratic party
chairman Steve Grossman.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spoke on four issues: education, Social Security, HMO
reform and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Gore mentioned crowding that forced some schools to served lunch
as early as 9:30 a.m., drawing gasps from the group.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also slammed Republicans for bringing on the budget impasse
by ``entrenching themselves and working very hard to go back to old
retro-nomics.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore ended by urging the group to support gubernatorial
candidate Buddy MacKay, who spent the morning in Orlando debating
opponent Jeb Bush.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay joined Gore back at the airport where the vice president
unveiled the plan and praised environmentalists who helped draft
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over a century ago, President Truman dedicated Everglades
National Park with words you know: For all people, for all time,''
he said. ``Today, we remain dedicated to exactly that vision.''
</P>
<P>
   He then boarded Air Force II for Miami where he planned to stop
at an elementary school and retirement home before attending the
reception and dinner, an aid said. He was scheduled to leave for
Washington at 11 p.m.

 &HT;    Union leaders blast privatization amid job program claims
 &HT;    By Earl Golz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Critics of the state's attempt to farm out some of its
duties to contractors such as SER Jobs for Progress Inc. are
renewing calls against privatization following disclosure of SER's
alleged problems as manager of jobs training centers for the
unemployed in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   A story in Tuesday's American-Statesman detailed former SER
employees' claims that they were told to falsify records to make
the agency look better as it sought continued funding. The story
pointed out that state and federal investigators are examining the
employees' claims.
</P>
<P>
   SER, a private, nonprofit company, was chosen to manage the
state's two Capital of Texas Workforce Centers in Austin beginning
in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
   SER officials have denied that they had anything to do with the
falsified records. They said disgruntled employees made the
falsifications to make the company look bad because the employees
were laid off.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, Texas AFL-CIO President Joe Gunn issued a
statement that said SER's problems are ``proof that private
companies with conflicting allegiances are unequipped to manage
programs that invoke the public trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the Texas State Employees Union, a member of the
AFL-CIO that stands to lose members under privatization, seized
upon SER's problems to complain about state functions being
contracted out to private companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got organizations that aren't accountable to the
taxpayers using taxpayer money, they have every incentive to cut
corners and mislead us,'' said Ted Melina Raab, legislative
director of the state employees union.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Workforce Commission, which helped oversee the
privatization of the Austin job centers and similar centers
statewide, defended the move.
</P>
<P>
   Raab's comments ``sound an awful lot like sour grapes,'' said
David Beshear, spokesman for the commission. Beshear said the
contract with SER wasn't really privatization because SER is a
nonprofit company.
</P>
<P>
   Privatization, Beshear said, ``puts decision-making ability
closer to the people and more accountable.''

 &HT;    Cowboys give Jones happy birthday, season
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones was beaming so
proudly Tuesday, he looked like he had just won an Ed McMahon
sweepstakes contest.
</P>
<P>
   Over a plate of fried chicken, green beans and mashed potatoes,
Jones spoke about the quick getaway his Cowboys have had. The team
with a 4-2 record and a soft schedule has given its owner reason to
be satisfied with this football season.
</P>
<P>
   On his 56th birthday, Jones had plenty to be thankful for.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the changes we've made around here, it was important
to gain a measure of confidence,'' Jones said. ``Six games into the
season, I don't know if I've ever felt better about our future.
We've got a long way to go, but I don't know how you could ask for
a better birthday present.''
</P>
<P>
   These are happy days in Valley Ranch. Less than a year after the
Cowboys sank to a 6-10 record and released Coach Barry Switzer,
Jones is talking about the playoffs again. And why not? The leaders
of the NFC East are 3-0 against division opponents and show no
signs of falling apart for the second straight year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only am I excited about this year, I'm excited about what
we have the chance to accomplish over the next several years,''
said Jones, in his 10th season as owner of the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   The owner's optimism stems from the NFL's most improved offense.
The Cowboys, 20th in the league in offense last season, have bolted
to No. 4 this year. Even more surprising is the emergence of Emmitt
Smith, the leading rusher in the NFC with 529 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers felt Smith was washed up after last season. The
29-year-old running back can thank the big blockers in front of him
for his turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we've ended up singing the blues around here is when we
haven't been able to move the football,'' Jones said. ``Every time
we've had success moving the football, we've gone on to win Super
Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are much better on the offensive line this year. In my
mind, our offensive line is as responsible for our 4-2 record as
anything else. That's where we had the most glaring problems
heading into the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones cited three other factors for the team's early success:
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Daryl Johnston has overcome a neck injury and provided
solid blocking for Smith and Chris Warren. Last year Johnston
missed the final 10 games, one reason the Cowboys lost their last
six.
</P>
<P>
   Backup Jason Garrett has filled in nicely at quarterback during
Troy Aikman's four-game absence. The Cowboys are averaging 25
points and 346 yards per game with Garrett as the starter. The Ivy
Leaguer is expected to sign a new contract to remain in Dallas
after the season.
</P>
<P>
   The players have responded favorably to first-year coach Chan
Gailey's innovative offense. The Cowboys rank fifth in the league
in rushing offense and 10th in passing offense, and have yielded
only seven sacks in six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of factors for the offensive success,''
Gailey said. ``It has a lot to do with the continuity of the
offensive line. (Tight end) David LaFleur is a very strong blocker.
(Johnston) is healthy. And Emmitt's healthier than he has been. The
combination of all those factors creates the opportunity for this
to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing sweeter than the birthday cake Jones shared with
friends is the team's upcoming schedule. The final 10 opponents on
the Cowboy schedule are a combined 23-35. That includes games
against 1-5 Chicago, 1-5 Philadelphia and 0-6 Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey has been so busy preparing the Cowboys for Sunday's game
against the Bears that he forgot one minor detail Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what he bought Jones for his birthday, the new coach
said he was unaware his boss turned 56.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to go out and get a card,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   NOTES _ Wide receiver Billy Davis (sprained foot) is not
expected to play Sunday. Ernie Mills will take his spot, and Jeff
Ogden likely will be activated as a backup receiver. . . . Jones
said Nate Newton has played so well on the offensive line that he
will be asked to return next year. . . . In the 1990s, the Cowboys
are 26-8 in games played in October.

 &HT;    Proposed plan to save Everglades unveiled
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Vice President Al Gore unveiled a $7.8
billion plan by Tuesday to restore the Everglades while providing
freshwater to farms and South Florida's 6 million residents.
</P>
<P>
   After a morning of fund-raising, Gore, flanked by Lt. Gov. Buddy
MacKay at Palm Beach International Airport, hailed ``the next
crucial step.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Over a century ago President Truman dedicated Everglades
National Park with words you know: For all the people, for all
time. Today we remain dedicated to exactly that vision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 3,500-page plan, spearheaded by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, outlines projects necessary to provide South Florida
with flood protection, preserve its water supply and restore the
Everglades delicate ecosystem, Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   It includes 60 projects and will undergo 11 public hearings in
South Florida through November and December. A final version will
be sent to Congress for approval in July. If approved, the federal
government would split the bill over 20 years with state and local
governments.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore first announced the plan in 1996, he said it would
include buying land crucial to the restoration, speeding up
research and increasing money.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's detailed draft explains how a network of levees and
canals created in 1948 over 18,000 square miles need to be
improved. The system was designed to provide water to 2 million,
not today's population of 6 million. The number is expected to rise
to 8 million over the next 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're starting to see people thinking of the consequences of
not doing the (plan),'' said Frank ``Sonny'' Williamson, chairman
of the South Florida Water Management District board. ``If we get
in the water wars of Tampa Bay, a generation will lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan can be reviewed via the Internet at www.restudy.org, at
county libraries or by CD-Rom. For more information, call
(904)232-3332.

 &HT;    Drunk driving arrest could mean jailtime for Mack
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Bengals safety Tremain Mack faces possible jail
time and suspension by the NFL after his second drunken driving
arrest in a year.
</P>
<P>
   Mack, 23, was arrested Tuesday after police found him asleep at
the wheel of his car in the right lane of northbound I-75 near
downtown Cincinnati at 4:44 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   According to the police report, Mack failed a field sobriety
test and then pushed the arresting officer, who subdued him with
the help of a chemical spray.
</P>
<P>
   The report said officer Ryan Jones found Mack passed out at the
wheel of a 1992 Pontiac Grand Prix with the keys in the ignition.
Mack smelled of alcohol and failed a sobriety test, then resisted
when he was arrested, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Mack allegedly pushed the officer, who sprayed him with mace.
When Mack pushed Jones again, the officer punched him in the
stomach three times and got him into the police car, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mack faces a sentence of up to six months in jail and a $1,000
fine if convicted of drunken driving. The resisting arrest charge
carries a maximum 90-day jail term and $750 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Mack was charged with drunken driving, resisting arrest and
driving without a license. He was released from the Hamilton County
Justice Center on $6,000 bond. Arraignment is at 9 a.m. today in
Hamilton County Municipal Court.
</P>
<P>
   Mack _ a former University of Miami (Fla) star who had been
arrested six times in a four-year span before the Bengals picked
him in the fourth round of the 1997 draft _ was still on probation
from a drunken driving conviction after his October 26, 1997 arrest
in Clermont County.
</P>
<P>
   He could be ordered to serve up to 330 days in jail _ the
suspended part of his previous sentence _ if he is convicted on the
latest charges.
</P>
<P>
   NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said the league will investigate Mack.
He could be fined and suspended for four games under a substance
abuse policy set forth by the league and NFL Players Association in
the collective bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``A first offense is usually a fine _ half a game check up to a
maximum of $20,000,'' Aiello said. ``Repeat violations would lead
to increased discipline and possible suspension.''
</P>
<P>
   A four-game suspension would cost Mack $38,588 _ four pay checks
from his 1998 salary of $164,000. He's in the second year of a
three-year, $710,000 contract.
</P>
<P>
   Mack remains on the Bengals' 53-man roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mack's situation falls under the jurisdiction of the NFL's
alcohol policy,'' Bengals president Mike Brown said. ``Announcement
of any football-related discipline in this case will be made by the
league office. It would be improper for the club to comment further
until it becomes known what actions local courts and the NFL will
take.''
</P>
<P>
   Mack couldn't be reached for comment. His agent, Marc R.
Pollack, said: ``It's a tough situation. It's obviously very tough
for Tremain and it's tough for us. We hope it all works out.''
</P>
<P>
   Following his arrest last year, Mack entered an NFL-approved
treatment center and was activated for the last month of the
season, but did not play.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals' top kickoff returner this year, Mack had a 97-yard
touchdown at Baltimore on Sept. 27. The players were off on Monday
and Tuesday after a 25-20 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers.

 &HT;    Bochy calls Braves' bluff; Cox responds in kind
 &HT;    By Gary Nuhn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was the right call.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be a total failure, like the Edsel; like Ed
Asner in shorts and a tank top; like Roseanne singing the National
Anthem.
</P>
<P>
   But Bruce Bochy had to do it.
</P>
<P>
   When the San Diego manager brought on Kevin Brown, his best
starting pitcher, in relief Monday night against Atlanta, the
risk/reward ratio was as clear as the aquarium at Sea World.
</P>
<P>
   Risk: If Brown failed to hold the 4-2 lead, it would not only
remove his aura of invincibility, it would also wreck the Padres'
pitching plans for the rest of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Reward: If Brown held, there would be no rest of the series.
There would be fireworks in the sky, and Qualcomm Stadium would
turn into Mardi Gras.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't the second game of makeup doubleheader in August.
This was Game 5 of the National League Championship Series, the
Padres were nine outs away from winning it, and all Bochy needed
were six of those nine outs from Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Then he had Trevor Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   Although the second-guessing in San Diego is rampant, Bochy
should ignore it.The door was ajar, Atlanta had its fingers in the
door; you slam the door.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, Bochy tried to slam the door, and his house fell
down.
</P>
<P>
   I've never understood why Michael Tucker hasn't made it big.
</P>
<P>
   He was Kansas City's No. 1 prospect with a sweet, quick
left-handed swing that promised more than it ever delivered. It
took the Royals portions of just two seasons to give up on him.
</P>
<P>
   So here he was Monday night after a lousy season facing Brown in
with two on and one out in the eighth in what well could have been
his last at-bat in a Braves' uniform.
</P>
<P>
   If he made an out, and Brown and Hoffman finished the job,
there's a good chance he'd be somewhere else in 1999 because
.244-hitting right fielders generally don't hang around one team
very long, plus the Braves have a kid, George Lombard, whom they
think might be the next Andruw Jones.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the beauty of baseball. A guy hitting .194 (6 for
31) over the past two postseasons was matched against a guy who had
given up one earned run in 23 postseason innings over the last two
weeks, and the guy hitting .194 jacked one 380 feet into the first
row in right field between a couple of palm trees.
</P>
<P>
   Logically that couldn't happen. It was as if John Starks beat
Michael Jordan in a game of one-on-one.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta held on to win 7-6 in a game so marvelous that, like
Game 6 of the 1975 World Series (Carlton Fisk's 12-inning home run
beat the Reds), even the losers were gushing later.
</P>
<P>
   This was the Padres' Wally Joyner: ``That might have been the
best game I ever played in. It was like a chess match with live
people. When you go back and start looking for one play you find
about 20 of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Finley called it ``unbelievably exciting'' and Tony Gwynn
called it ``exciting theater,'' a game that ended with the best
starting pitcher of the '90s, Greg Maddux, making his first relief
appearance in 11 years, facing the best hitter of the '90s, Gwynn.
</P>
<P>
   As chants of ``Tony! Tony! Tony!'' filled the San Diego night,
Gwynn bounced out to end it after 3 hours, 17 minutes of nerves
rubbed raw.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has been having postseason parties since 1902, and in
all those years, no team down 3-nil has ever come back to win. Now
the Braves, once down 3-nil, are halfway there.
</P>
<P>
   So here we are again, in this scream of a season, peeking once
again at possible history, just as we did all summer as Mark
McGwire and Sammy Sosa played Top This.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Bochy said, ``Top this,'' and the Braves did.

 &HT;    'Buckeye poll' not the usual ranking
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ It's called ``The Buckeye Poll'' and this week
Ohio State opponent Minnesota (3-2) is No. 1 in it. Next week, OSU
foe Northwestern (2-4) will be the top-ranked team, according to
Buckeye tailback Joe Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the underdogs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Ohio State fans panic, know that the ``The Buckeye Poll''
was concocted by Montgomery and has no bearing on which teams go to
the national championship Fiesta Bowl in January. The fictitious
poll is just the tailback's way of trying to create some motivation
heading into games against unranked opponents Minnesota (Saturday)
and Northwestern (Oct. 24).
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Buckeye Poll or Montgomery-Buckeye poll, as fellow
tailback Michael Wiley refers to it, is probably the most elaborate
motivational tool being used by an OSU player. But it shows the
kind of mental gymnastics some of the players are using to stay
focused and sharp heading into the last six weeks of their season.
During that time, they will not face an opponent currently ranked
in either the Associated Press or USA Today /ESPN coaches' top 25.
</P>
<P>
   OSU quarterback Joe Germaine, who, like the rest of Montgomery's
teammates, said they had never heard of the Buckeye poll,
nevertheless admitted that taking an underdog mindset wasn't a bad
idea.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow tri-captain and OSU linebacker Jerry Rudzinski agreed. He
said the Buckeyes have been 5-0 before _ in 1995, '96 and last
season, in fact _ so this is nothing new. What would set them apart
from previous 5-0 squads is finishing the year undefeated. For
Rudzinski, striving for that perfect season is his motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Antoine Winfield said revving up competition among
his OSU teammates is one way he's trying to stay hungry each week.
</P>
<P>
   He said the defensive backs have been battling to collect the
most interceptions each game, which, he admits, may have led to two
pass interference calls in the Illinois game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secondary, we wanted to see who could get the first
interception,'' he said. ``That's why Ahmed and I got those pass
interference calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if they'd be as overly aggressive against a more feared
foe such as Michigan, Winfield smiled and said, ``We're not that
stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn State coach Joe Paterno, whose Nittany Lions were No. 1 at
times last season, said discipline and guidance, not mind games,
are key to staying on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have strong leadership and I think Ohio State
does,'' Paterno said. ``John (Cooper) seems to have them where they
ought to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State defensive coordinator Fred Pagac believes as long as
the Buckeyes continue to concentrate on their performance, they'll
continue to be successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of letdowns are caused by opposing teams,'' he said. ``I
think the key thing is staying focused and treating each game with
equal weight.''

SCHUMER ASSAILS D'AMATO OVER HIGH SPEAKING FEES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In one of his sharpest attacks yet on Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato's ethics, Rep. Charles Schumer, the Democratic nominee for
the Senate, accused his opponent Tuesday of ``lining his pockets''
with $390,000 in speaking fees from large corporations and other
special-interest groups that had legislation pending before
Congress between 1981 and 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The assertion represented a new line of attack for Schumer and
came as he appeared on the defensive from D'Amato's accusations
that he had become a ``part-time'' congressman who had missed 110
floor votes in the last year while campaigning in New York.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, a Republican seeking his fourth term, drummed on that
theme again Tuesday morning in appearances on Staten Island with
Staten Island Borough President Guy Molinari. ``You can't win a
fight if you're not there,'' the senator said under drizzly skies
near the South Beach boardwalk.
</P>
<P>
   Just an hour later, Schumer, speaking at a news conference in
Washington, where he had returned Monday afternoon to cast votes as
Congress rushed toward adjournment, said the $390,820 that D'Amato
received in honorariums from tobacco, banking, insurance and other
industry groups over 10 years was ``not illegal, but it sure was
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters of New York should have somebody representing them
who doesn't personally benefit from groups that they are
legislating,'' said Schumer, adding that he has not accepted any
honorariums during his 18 years in Congress. In 1991, Congress
prohibited its members from keeping speaking fees after concerns
were raised that special-interest groups were using paid speaking
engagements to buy access in both houses.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1981 and 1991, according to a list released by the
Schumer campaign, D'Amato accepted $6,000 from the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants, $6,000 from the Federal
National Mortgage Association, $6,000 from General Electric Co.,
$4,000 from Merrill Lynch, $3,000 from Metropolitan Life Insurance
Co., $6,000 from the New York State Bankers Association, and $2,000
from U.S. Tobacco Co.
</P>
<P>
   During much of that time, D'Amato was a member of the Senate
Banking Committee, which regulates banks, insurance companies and
other finance companies. His annual Senate salary during that
period rose from $69,900 in 1982 to $125,100 in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato did not dispute Schumer's figures but called his
criticism ``the act of a desperate man'' who was trying to deflect
public attention from his poor attendance record in the House this
year. Schumer's lifetime voting record is more than 90 percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``That was permissible,'' D'Amato said about the speaking fees.
``What you have here is someone who can't stand up to the fact that
he has the worst attendance record in Congress from the New York
delegation. Only five in the entire country have missed more votes.
And now, in an act of desperation, he's trying to becloud the
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's comments at his Washington news conference continued
the rapid attack-counterattack rhythm of the contest _ which is
considered one of the tightest Senate races in the nation _ and fit
into his overall effort to portray D'Amato as untrustworthy. But
his suggestions that D'Amato has personally profited from his
elected office added a new dimension to the tactic.
</P>
<P>
   It also showed that Schumer, under fierce attack by D'Amato, was
willing to embrace more fully a strategy he had seemed to be shying
away from before. At the beginning of the campaign, Schumer said
Democrats had erred by making D'Amato's ethics a central issue in
the 1992 campaign. Since then, Schumer has retreated somewhat from
that position, saying that ethics should be one part of a broader
assault on D'Amato's 18-year Senate record.
</P>
<P>
   But until Tuesday, he had done little to suggest that D'Amato
has used his office for personal gain.
</P>
<P>
   At events Tuesday at South Beach and a senior center on Staten
Island, D'Amato and his allies said Schumer, who is from Brooklyn,
would work against the interests of Staten Island residents. The
borough has overwhelmingly voted for D'Amato in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Chuck Schumer is elected to the Senate, whose side is he
going to take?'' Molinari asked at the Giuseppe Mazzini Center.
``Ours? Or Brooklyn's? The answer is obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   Molinari predicted that, if elected, Schumer would work against
closing the Fresh Kills landfill, which handles Brooklyn garbage,
and would try to end the one-way toll collection system at the
Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. That system has reduced air pollution
from idling vehicles on the Staten Island side, D'Amato said.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Schumer, said the congressman
supports closing Fresh Kills but favors keeping the one-way tolls
in place.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after Molinari raised the specter of Brooklyn
political power, a prominent Brooklyn community organization, the
Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corp., gave D'Amato an award Tuesday
night at its annual gala dinner at the New York Hilton Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Rocky Mitchell, president of the corporation, a nonpartisan
housing and economic development organization that was founded by
Sen. Robert F. Kennedy in 1967, said D'Amato had played a pivotal
role in assuring that the group's $800,000 in deposits at the
Freedom National Bank in Harlem were fully insured by the federal
government after the bank collapsed in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato is also a member of the group's board, as is the state's
Democratic senator, Daniel Patrick Moynihan.

 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Struggling to meet their fourth deadline over the
federal budget, congressional Republicans and White House officials
wrestled Tuesday with their differences over education, the most
politically high-stakes element of the budget battle.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators ended a late-night session without resolving
disagreements over not just education, but the census and
contraceptives. These were among the biggest issues that still
separated the two sides as each tried to formulate a message to
take home to voters for the Nov. 3 elections.
</P>
<P>
   On education, the issue that President Clinton has propelled to
the forefront and on which Republicans do not want to appear
recalcitrant, both sides have agreed to spend more than $1 billion
but not on how to spend it. The president insists that the money be
spent to hire 100,000 teachers across the country so that the
average class can be reduced to 18 students. Republicans, railing
against ``Beltway bureaucrats,'' say that local school districts
should decide how the money is spent, whether it be for teachers or
computers.
</P>
<P>
   As the two sides broke Tuesday night, White House chief of staff
Erskine Bowles, the president's top negotiator, emerged from the
session saying: ``We don't have a deal. We made some good progress.
The biggest issue, still, is the 100,000 teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``There are still some open issues'' upon which no
agreement has been reached, but he sounded optimistic about a
session scheduled for Wednesday morning. ``I think we've got a
chance of wrapping up tomorrow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides remained apart on several ideological matters,
including whether to allow federal health plans to cover
contraceptives and whether to allow those few plans with religious
affiliations to refuse to cover contraceptives not only on
religious grounds but on moral grounds as well.
</P>
<P>
   They were also split on how to conduct the census in 2000, which
is one of the thorniest issues. It is not one that moves voters,
but it is vital to both parties because it helps determine their
relative strength in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Bowles met for much of the day
in the speaker's office, shuttling in and out of ante-rooms with
their lieutenants but giving few clues about the nitty-gritty
details of their talks.
</P>
<P>
   They have given themselves another deadline of midnight
Wednesday to wrap up about $500 billion worth of spending items,
but they could easily extend that deadline another day or two. They
missed having spending bills in place for the Oct. 1 start of the
fiscal year, providing temporary financing for the federal
government through Oct. 9, then Oct. 12, then Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the other central issues, like financing for the
International Monetary Fund, were all but nailed down, but neither
side was ready to declare a final deal until all the other elements
of the budget package were in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're down to splitting infinitives,'' House Majority Leader
Dick Armey said of approving money for the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   As they worked through several issues, Republican leaders
appeared to be calculating the differences in their own party that
might sour a final deal when it arrives on the House floor _ more
of a concern than the Senate floor because the Senate has fewer
differences among its Republicans and with the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Some conservative Republicans said they were concerned over the
emerging shape of the final package, particularly elements dealing
with family planning and emergency spending.
</P>
<P>
   They say the president's proposals for emergency spending, on
such items as the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, fixing the year
2000 computer bug and providing relief to American farmers, will
break the limits in last year's balanced-budget agreement. The
administration said such money would come from corresponding cuts
elsewhere in the budget, but conservatives say it comes from
raiding the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   If Republican leaders cannot count on their conservatives, they
will need support from Democrats to pass the final package. And
Democrats on Tuesday expressed concern over some White House
positions, on issues like the census and an apparent compromise
with Republicans on aid for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., a leader of House conservatives,
said he believed Republican leaders were ceding too quickly to the
White House. He said that the president appeared to be getting his
way on some issues but that what he really seemed to be winning was
the war of public relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is getting what he wants; he's controlling the
situation,'' McIntosh lamented. When Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott appears on television, McIntosh said, ``it's in reaction to
the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, McIntosh suggested that he could vote for a final
accord. ``Most conservatives are holding out for a better deal than
we're hearing,'' he said, ``but we'll probably give them the vote
because we don't see a much better alternative happening if it goes
down.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Others were distressed, particularly about two contraceptive
issues. One would require federal health plans to cover
contraceptives. The other would bar overseas family-planning
organizations from lobbying to change abortion laws in other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., said he wanted to see the final
language on the health plan measure. As it passed both the House
and the Senate, it allowed for health plans with religious
affiliation to decline to offer contraceptive coverage; Coburn
wants plans to be able to refuse such coverage on moral grounds as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The plan covers five specific types of contraception. Coburn
said he wanted two of those _ Depo-Provera and intrauterine devices
_ to be eliminated from coverage because he said they interfered
with fertilization and were therefore considered to cause
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats like Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., who introduced the
contraceptive plan in the House, said she strongly objected to
Coburn's position. She said that health plans based their decisions
on what to offer on profits, not morals.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether the White House will insist on keeping
the contraceptive coverage in the final package and will oppose the
moral exception. If the administration allows the moral exception,
it could alienate some House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats are also worried about the direction the talks
are taking on the census. This has always loomed as one of the
biggest issues separating Democrats and Republicans. The results of
a census help determine the future power of the two political
parties. But the fact that the two sides are finally talking about
it now indicates that they are covering the full range of budget
matters that need to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has proposed buying time on the matter by
financing the Commerce, State and Justice departments only for five
months. The Commerce Department contains the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said this would put off the nettlesome
issue while allowing a resolution of the entire spending package,
but House Democrats worry it would be a prelude to giving in to
Republicans down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders like the idea of postponing a decision but
say that financing should be restricted only for the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   On several touchy environmental issues that have prompted
repeated veto threats from the White House, the two sides appeared
to be opting for compromise over confrontation, with several
disputes resolved. But a few particularly difficult issues remained
under negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   A compromise was struck between the White House and Alaskan
lawmakers on logging in the Tongass National Forest. But compromise
still eluded them on the question of building a road through a
wilderness refuge to connect two communities in Alaska.

UNCLE MILTIE IS 90 
LAWYERS SUE `MCBEAL' STAR 
A SCHIZOPHRENIC LIFE
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By JAMES BARRON AND AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No wonder Goldie Hawn put on her sunglasses. Long
before President Clinton arrived at the G&AMP;P Charitable Foundation's
party honoring Milton Berle on his 90th birthday, the photographers
were busy. First they took pictures of Ms. Hawn alone.
</P>
<P>
   Then she was introduced to Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York,
and there was another round of snap-snap, flash-flash. ``I'm so
pictured out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then she went to Berle's table, and bowed. He stood up and
kissed her. More snap-snap, flash-flash.
</P>
<P>
   One can only imagine what it would have been like if her
longtime companion, Kurt Russell, had been there. ``He flew to
Washington to see Boston,'' Ms. Hawn said. It sounded like a
punchline from her days on ``Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In,'' but no.
Russell has an 18-year-old son, Boston, who is a student at
Georgetown University. In Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when Berle left the cocktail party for the ballroom where
the dinner was about to begin, it was his turn for some snap-snap,
flash-flash with his wife, Lorna. ``She keeps telling me how happy
I am,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Katie Couric, an anchor on the ``Today''
show, dressed in Armani. Maybe it was just that she had stayed up
past her bedtime, but when she went over to greet reporters who had
been corralled behind a rope, she said: ``Can you believe it? I've
never had a really nice dress before.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a man from the Philippines introduced himself, saying that
he watched her every morning. He asked if he could shake her hand.
She agreed. Then he asked if he could kiss her hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' she said. ``Why not?'' So he did.
</P>
<P>
   Unflattering Suit
</P>
<P>
   This is probably not something they will talk about in the
unisex bathroom on ``Ally McBeal'':
</P>
<P>
   Calista Flockhart, the star with the thigh-climbing skirts and
the dancing-baby hallucinations, is being sued by a real-life
Manhattan law firm, which says she owes the firm 5 percent of
everything she earns from the prime-time series.
</P>
<P>
   The law firm _ Frankfurt, Garbus, Klein and Seltz _ which says
it reviewed the contract she signed when she got the part,
maintains that the fine print in that document promises the firm 5
percent of her ``Ally McBeal'' earnings, which total $780,000 as of
last week. Frankfurt, Garbus is accusing her of breach of contract
for failing to pay $39,000.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers filed in State Supreme Court, the firm laid out
the financial arrangements it says Ms. Flockhart agreed to. The
firm says the contract called for her to take home $50,000 for the
pilot episode and $30,000 an episode once the series went on the
air.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made absolutely every effort to resolve this,'' said
Maura Wogan, who filed the lawsuit for the firm. But a spokesman
for Ms. Flockhart said, ``She doesn't owe them any money.''
</P>
<P>
   Dividing Her Time
</P>
<P>
   So how does Isabel Allende find time to write? Tuesday she was
in New York, doing the things authors do: being interviewed in the
morning and appearing at a ceremony in the evening. She left the
ceremony, at the Hudson Theater on West 44th Street, with the
$200,000 Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize. But back to the question
of time to write.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a very schizophrenic life,'' Ms. Allende said. ``One
part is about being out there, and one part is private, quiet.
Fortunately, I don't have to take care of my kids anymore. They're
grown and gone.''
</P>
<P>
   She told an interviewer that the ceremony was the first time her
parents, her son and a Chilean friend had been in the same place at
the same time in 25 years. She also said that she had just finished
another novel, about the California gold rush. ``My mother is the
only person who corrects my manuscripts,'' Ms. Allende said. ``She
said, `I'm so pleased that for the first time we're not in the
book.'''

TWO JC TRANSFERS SPARKING OREGON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Pac-10's top-ranked offense will be on display
Saturday at the Rose Bowl and it won't be wearing blue and gold.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon has averaged 539.8 yards and 50.6 points per game while
ascending to No. 11 in the rankings, thanks to superb play from two
junior college transfers, quarterback Akili Smith and tailback
Reuben Droughns.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, in his second year after transferring from Grossmont
(Calif.) Junior College, leads the nation in passing efficiency
(196.3), with 15 touchdowns and three interceptions. His
improvement is comparable to the strides Cade McNown made between
his sophomore and junior seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost every JC athlete takes a while to figure out the tempo
and speed of the Pac-10,'' Ducks coach Mike Bellotti said. ``Akili
is a perfect example. He spent the offseason figuring out what he
didn't know ... and now he's very comfortable in the offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Droughns didn't take as long to adjust. He leads the Pac-10 in
rushing (163 yards per game) and is the ninth player in conference
history to rush for 200 yards in three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to be the best back we've played,'' said Washington
State coach Mike Price, who faced UCLA's tailbacks two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   __ Tear-jerker: Four days later, the Bruins are talking about
their emotional team meeting Friday night in which coach Bob Toledo
singled out his defensive line and quarterback, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called them up and challenged each one of them,'' offensive
tackle Kris Farris said. ``He said, `Travor Turner, how many sacks
do you have? None. What are you going to do to change that? Pete
Holland, how many sacks do you have? None. What are you going to do
to change that?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he read from a stack of papers from Arizona that said our
quarterback wasn't worth a darn. He looked at Cade and said,
`They're challenging you, Cade. What are you going to do about it?'

SHIFT IN RULES AT RESERVOIRS DRAWS SUIT TO PROTECT NYC WATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ City officials last month began allowing developers
around the city's upstate reservoirs to install septic systems on
steeply sloping hills, drawing the concern of federal officials and
environmentalists, who fear that the practice could pollute the
city's water supply.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy, which is a shift from more stringent rules the
city had put in place in March, has prompted a coalition of
environmental groups to prepare to file a lawsuit Wednesday against
the city in state Supreme Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The rules on septic tanks are the latest front in the
long-running battle over how to protect the city's drinking water
from pollution without throttling development in the upstate
counties where the reservoirs are. The new policy comes 20 months
after the city reached a hard-fought agreement with the upstate
communities intended to protect the watershed and forestall the
need for the city to build a huge filtration plant to meet federal
clean water standards.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit, the environmental groups contend that the looser
rules on septic tanks were adopted with no public debate or review
of environmental impact, violating city and state laws.
</P>
<P>
   They say it will raise the risk that bacteria-laden waste water
from septic systems and muddy runoff from erosion could taint the
reservoirs, and that the rule will allow development to accelerate
in fast-growing areas like northern Westchester and Putnam
counties, where most level ground has been developed and proposals
for subdivisions are moving up the slopes.
</P>
<P>
   Septic fields on steep slopes tend to fail more frequently than
those on more level ground, technical experts for the environmental
groups said.
</P>
<P>
   But city environmental officials said their policy is in line
with longstanding state health guidelines and protects the water
without stepping on the rights of the growing communities around
the reservoirs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't permit a sanitary system to be installed if we
felt there was any negative impact whatsoever on our water
quality,'' said Joel Miele, New York City commissioner of
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
   Those assurances have not allayed the concerns of Federal
environmental officials, however. In a letter last month to Miele,
Jeanne Fox, the regional chief of the Environmental Protection
Agency, complained that the city switched to the new standard
without informing the EPA and other parties that signed the broad
agreement in 1997 on how to protect the reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
   The new city policy says that septic fields can be built around
the reservoirs on slopes of up to 20 percent _ where the ground
drops 20 feet every 100 horizontal feet _ if truckloads of fill are
used to reduce the slope to a gentler 15 percent. The new policy
reversed a decision by the city last March to forbid any
septic-field construction on slopes draining into the reservoirs
where the land drops more than 15 feet every 100 feet, a 15 percent
grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``EPA strongly supports the plain reading of the state's septic
design standards,'' Ms. Fox wrote to Miele, ``which state that
`slopes greater than 15 percent are unacceptable.' They also state
that `the natural surface shall not be significantly disturbed.'''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``It is prudent environmental policy to minimize as
much as possible any factor that might add to the risk of failure
of newly installed septic systems.''
</P>
<P>
   New York's far-flung network of reservoirs has provided the city
with clean water without the need of filtration for more than a
century, but encroaching development has forced the construction of
an $800 million filtration plant for the most degraded reservoirs,
in the crowded suburbs east of the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   With the signing of the accord, the EPA dropped a threat to
force New York City to build a $6 billion filtration plant for its
cleanest reservoirs, in the Catskills and the Delaware River
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Miele said the city chose to mesh its policy on septic systems
with the state policy because anything stricter would almost
certainly result in a raft of lawsuits from developers. He added
that the city, in its agreement with the watershed communities, had
agreed it ``would not unnecessarily impinge on development without
a reason for it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the city had seen no evidence that septic systems
on filled slopes with a 15 percent grade were any less effective
than those on a natural slope of the same angle. ``If we had a
reason for it, I'd fight tooth and nail,'' he said. ``But I don't
see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of several of the groups initiating the lawsuit
argued that the new policy adds to the pollution threat in many
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Septic systems on steeper slopes have a greater tendency to
fail, and excavating or dumping fill on a slope can cause erosion
and reduce the filtering properties of the landscape, said Robert
F. Kennedy Jr., a lawyer representing Riverkeeper, the Natural
Resources Defense Council, and eight other petitioners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't understand why the agency charged with
protecting public health would deliberately weaken rules designed
to protect the reservoirs,'' Kennedy said Tuesday. ``The true
justification for the rule change does not appear to be good
science, but pressure from the construction and real estate
industry in the watershed.''
</P>
<P>
   Around 25 percent of all applications for septic systems in
Putnam County are on slopes greater than 15 percent, said Richard
Knabel, a geologist at Westchester Community College, in Valhalla,
N.Y., who submitted an affidavit in support of the suit.
</P>
<P>
   He said the hilltops in the county are covered by a thin layer
of soils left behind by glaciers that vary from gravel to
impermeable clay, creating uneven conditions that often thwart the
best intentions of sanitary engineers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to put a septic system in those situations and the
liquids go sideways,'' he said, resulting in uncleaned waste water
surfacing and flowing downhill.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Heelan, the president of Heelan Realty &AMP; Development
Corp., which controls 10,000 acres in Putnam and northern
Westchester, said the environmentalists were less concerned with
pollution than with bringing construction to a halt in the region.
</P>
<P>
   He said that strict limits won by environmentalists on
construction of sewage plants and on control of runoff from
rainstorms had already stopped large-scale commercial development.
``Now they're going after shutting down individual housing
development,'' Heelan said. ``It's a further confiscation of
people's property rights.''

GIANTS UNLIKELY TO COOPERATE
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The San Francisco Giants do not sound like they are
going to grant the hated Dodgers permission to talk to Dusty Baker
about the vacant managerial position.
</P>
<P>
   Giants general manager Brian Sabean said Tuesday at the club's
organizational meetings. ``(Baker) is under contract, that's all I
can say,'' alluding to the two-year extension that kicks in this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Baker led the Giants to a wild-card playoff game against the
Chicago Cubs this past season after winning the National League
West in 1997. He will earn $700,000 this coming season. At the time
Baker signed the extension, the Giants said they wanted him to be
with the club in 2000 when they open their new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Because he is under contract, the Dodgers have to receive
permission to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone has not set up
an interview with Davey Johnson, who also is being considered for
the manager's job in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   After rushing to hire Felipe Alou, who stayed with Montreal,
Malone said he will be more patient in the next round of
discussions. He hopes to have a manager in place by his own
organizational meetings, Oct. 28-Nov. 1 in Vero Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Tigers' payroll is not expected to climb above $30
million next season, Johnson clearly is hoping the Dodgers act
soon. They are expected to have a $75 million payroll in 1999.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Michelle Leung's kindergarten classroom at Public
School 184 on the Lower East Side looks much like any other, with a
few hard-to-miss exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The tags taped onto her students' pint-size tables have their
names written in bold block letters and also in painterly Chinese
characters. Objects throughout the room _ the door, the clock, the
closet _ also bear signs identifying them in English and Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the entire school day is infused with both languages
because P.S. 184, which opened last month with two kindergarten
classes, is the first public school in the nation designed to teach
fluency in English and Mandarin Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The school, one of more than 150 small, alternative public
schools that have opened across the city in the last few years, is
also known as the Shuang Wen Academy, after the Chinese for
``double language.'' But it is a distinct departure from the
traditional bilingual programs that are criticized in many parts of
the country these days as hindrances to immigrants' learning the
language of their new land.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional bilingual programs seek to educate
non-English-speaking children by teaching them in their native
language until they are confident enough to learn exclusively in
English. These classes, which remain widely accepted in New York,
generally teach nonlinguistic subjects like science, history or
math.
</P>
<P>
   Shuang Wen, where most of the students speak at least some
English, has another, almost opposite goal. Like a small number of
other dual-language schools across the country, it seeks to teach
students the language and culture of their homeland for their own
sake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're different from a traditional bilingual program where
children are taught in their mother tongue just long enough to get
them fluent in English,'' said Ling-Ling Chou, the head of the
school. ``Here we teach in both languages, and we want them to
master both languages.''
</P>
<P>
   For the parents, nearly all of them immigrants or children of
immigrants, it is a way to help the children weave together their
Chinese and American selves. As such, it serves much the same
purpose as the dozens of weekend Chinese schools across the city,
where children study Chinese language and culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I grew up I saw a lot of kids who rebelled against being
Chinese and who rejected what they were,'' said Larry Lee, a social
worker and one of the leaders of the group of parents and community
activists who led the campaign to create Shuang Wen. ``With this
school, my hope is that these kids can be comfortable with who they
are and also be comfortable being American.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Shuang Wen met a certain amount of opposition in the
planning stages, when some non-Chinese teachers and residents of
the district said the school would be a barrier to assimilation.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, all 40 of the children at Shuang Wen are of
Chinese descent, though fewer than a quarter speak Mandarin, the
main language of China and Taiwan. Many are fluent in Cantonese,
which is still the predominant dialect in Chinatown, and a few
speak no Chinese at all.
</P>
<P>
   But school officials hope that as the school grows, grade by
grade, it will attract a more diverse student body _ one that
includes children of other ethnic groups.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The bulk of the regular school day, until 3 p.m., is taught in
English and run like a typical kindergarten class. They work on the
alphabet. They read from picture books. They paste leaves onto
construction paper. They nap. They have lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Leung uses Chinese sparingly, when a student doesn't
understand an instruction she has given in English. The teacher of
the other class, Aline Jaquez, doesn't speak any Chinese and so
relies on hand gestures and actions to communicate with her native
Chinese speakers. She also relies heavily on two full-time
volunteers who speak Mandarin and who sometimes help break up the
school day with short Chinese programs like a puppet show or an art
project.
</P>
<P>
   The core Chinese instruction, however, comes from 3 until 5:30,
from teachers paid with private funds raised mainly from
foundations.
</P>
<P>
   To combat the fatigue that the children naturally feel after a
full school day, the Chinese teachers emphasize music and movement.
</P>
<P>
   One day recently, a teacher, Julie Wei, got the children up on
their feet, punched on the tape player and used grand, exaggerated
gestures to lead them through a song describing a child's morning
regimen. Even the children who spoke no Chinese followed along
eagerly as they mimed and sang about washing their faces, brushing
their teeth, strapping on their book bags and waving goodbye to Mom
and Dad.
</P>
<P>
   The children have been strategically grouped at tables with at
least one student fluent in Mandarin and one fluent in English.
``They learn a lot from each other because at this age, they like
to imitate one another,'' Ms. Wei said. ``The best part is that
they don't even realize that they're teaching each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a third-generation Chinese-American who says he often
regrets his own inability to speak Chinese, said he and a group of
Asian-American educators had talked about starting a school like
Shuang Wen for nearly 10 years. But it wasn't until 1996 that they
formally proposed it and won a grant from New Visions for Public
Schools, a foundation that has helped establish more than 30
alternative public schools since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   When designing the school day, Shuang Wen's planning committee
had a fairly limited number of models. San Francisco has three
schools that teach Cantonese, and there are fewer than 200 Spanish
dual-language schools across the country, many of which are
patterned after Canadian schools that teach in French and English.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Carlo, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of
Education, said the hardest job of any dual-language school is
finding a way to educate everyone while still meeting the different
language needs of each child. ``A very delicate balance needs to be
achieved there in order to make it work,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Grande marvels at how much Chinese her 5-year-old
daughter, You Jing Streeter, has picked up in just a few short
weeks. You Jing is one of two children at the school who were
adopted from China by American parents; in the three years since
Ms. Grande and her husband adopted You Jing, they have made a
concerted effort to bring Chinese culture into their family life.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grande said You Jing was clearly a little frustrated after
the first day of school because she spoke no Mandarin. But she said
You Jing now comes home each day repeating Chinese phrases and
singing songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took her out of her culture, but we don't want her to lose
it,'' Ms. Grande said. ``And Shuang Wen, we think, will help her be
more comfortable in the culture she was born in.''

COMMENTARY: OLD KING PONG MAY BE DOWN, BUT NOT OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Marty Reisman hunkered down and inspected the table
tennis net. Wearing a purple shirt, red pants and a Panama hat, he
looked like a retiree going to the deli for a nosh. But the
hundred-dollar bill he held in his hand made it clear he wasn't
about to retire anywhere. He folded the bill and held it against
the net to check its height. It had to be exact.
</P>
<P>
   The old man with the C-note was about to risk losing 100 of them
in a high-stakes table-tennis match in Hell's Kitchen on Saturday
night. Scores of spectators lined up two rows deep to watch
Reisman, 68, play Jimmy Butler, a table-tennis champ in his 20s, in
a $10,000 challenge match.
</P>
<P>
   Reisman, a legendary player who has held 18 national and
international titles, wanted to prove that the hard-rubber racquet
he grew up with was superior to the spongy racquets that now
dominate the sport. He was unshakable in his belief that he could
beat ``the kid'' if both of them used the old-style racquets that
emphasized skill rather than the sponge racquets that provide
pingpong pyrotechnics.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night's battle was a grudge match, and not just because
he had lost $5,000 to Butler a few months before. He has carried a
grudge against the sponge racquet since the 1952 world
championship, when a Japanese player first trotted out the new
racquet to beat him with razzle-dazzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The match against Jimmy is the culmination, the peak game of
all the bitter feelings that accumulated in me over the years,'' he
said in a rapid, gravelly voice. ``To have the rug ripped out from
under me was a very frustrating experience, to be reduced and
swamped by a racquet.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a bit of drama in this, which is typical. Reisman will
tell you that he is known for bringing excitement to the game that
he learned to play in parks and settlement houses on the Lower East
Side. He discovered he had a natural gift for the game, which came
in handy at first by earning him dimes and quarters. Later, the
money got serious, as did he. He estimates that he has circled the
globe three times in search of games.
</P>
<P>
   He and his onetime partner, Doug Cartland, even used to play at
halftime shows for the Harlem Globetrotters. They used frying pans
as racquets and beat out the notes to ``Mary Had a Little Lamb'' as
they traded shots. The musicians' union objected and forced them to
stop.
</P>
<P>
   The only racquet Reisman hates is the sponge kind. The hard
rubber ones, he said, were an extension of a player's skill. The
sponge racquets, in contrast, give a mechanical advantage that
allows players who may be slow on their feet to slam and spin the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, there was a dialogue between two players, wherein a
6-year-old child could understand the dialogue between offense and
defense,'' he said. ``Today a point is made or lost with an
imperceptible twist of the wrist. For the most part, 90 percent of
the time the game is ridiculous and 10 percent it's sublime because
they can do some incredible things with the sponge. Sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   For Saturday night's match, Butler spotted Reisman 4 points in
each 21-point game. Butler also agreed not to hide the ball or
stamp the floor during his serves, common ploys in today's game.
But while the serves were silent, Reisman was not. Soon into the
match, he grew irritated at some spectators who clapped when he
missed a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not have any hysterics,'' he scolded them. ``It's
unwarranted. It's a normal shot to me.''
</P>
<P>
   When Butler missed and the crowd reluctantly clapped, Reisman
nodded his head. He kept up the patter during the match,
apologizing to Butler when he scored a point. Other times, he stole
a few more seconds to recover his breath by pretending to be in a
fog while looking for the ball. Between games, his wife, Yoshiko,
acted like a cut man in his corner, busily patting down his face
and arms and adjusting the cuffs on his pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drink,'' his friends urged him from the sidelines.
``Concentrate. Breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   The game resumed, as Butler slammed a volley of orange blurs
toward Reisman. He deftly returned them in a slow, graceful arc.
But it was not enough. He lost the match in the fifth game of the
third seven-game set.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he was $10,000 poorer but still surrounded by
friends. ``You played a nice game,'' one said. ``Take a little
water. You're a little cold.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah,'' Reisman replied. ``I'm ready to go again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't sex,'' another friend reminded him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not finished,'' Reisman insisted. ``I'm coming back here.
One way or another, I'm coming back.''

 McCALL AND OPPONENT URGE CURBS ON GIFTS  
(bl) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York State Comptroller H. Carl McCall and his Republican
opponent, Bruce Blakeman, announced competing plans Tuesday that
each said would improve the perception of state government by
placing new restrictions on political giving.
</P>
<P>
   Blakeman, a Nassau County legislator, said that if elected he
would unilaterally limit the contributions he would accept from
donors doing business with his office. He attacked McCall's fund
raising, saying that McCall's record of accepting large
contributions from such donors had harmed the integrity of the
office.
</P>
<P>
   Since he began his term in 1995, McCall has received more than
$1.8 million in contributions from donors doing business with the
state pension fund, which the Comptroller solely controls. That is
at least 35 percent of his total funds raised, $5.2 million,
according to campaign finance records.
</P>
<P>
   Blakeman repeatedly cited an article about McCall's fund-raising
that appeared earlier this month in The New York Times. It
described how some McCall donors gave money just before or after
they were awarded work by the pension fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``These new rules go a long way in curbing potential abuses,''
Blakeman said. ``I believe that when you analyze the contributions
that have been made to McCall and the size of the contributions and
the timing, it certainly gives the appearance that there is some
kind of pay-to-play scenario, which I think is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall has denied any link between donations and matters
involving his office, noting that he has long been a strong
supporter of overhauling the campaign finance system. He responded
to Blakeman's plan by issuing his own, which would affect all state
and local offices.
</P>
<P>
   McCall, who has a wide lead in opinion polls, proposed that the
state bar all candidates for state and local office from accepting
contributions from donors with interests before the offices they
hold or are seeking. He said he would introduce legislation in
January to bring about that change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad my opponent had joined me in calling for campaign
finance reform,'' McCall said in a statement. ``I only wish he
would jump all the way in instead of just sticking his toe in the
water.'' He later added: ``My opponent says if he is elected, he'll
limit the amount entities doing business with this office can
contribute. We have to go farther.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a broad ban has little chance of passing the Legislature,
which has not shown much interest in recent years in tightening the
campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   Under Blakeman's plan, individuals, companies and others
receiving business from the comptroller's office could contribute
up to $5,000, as opposed to the legal limit, $28,000.
</P>
<P>
   And executives of businesses involved with the office could give
up to $10,000 for each business. Under the law, there is no limit
on how much executives from the same business can give in total.
</P>
<P>
   McCall declined to say whether he would place any constraints on
his fund raising if the legislation was not approved. In the past,
he has said he would not unilaterally limit his fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Groups that advocate toughening the campaign finance laws say
the restrictions proposed by both candidates would be difficult to
enforce because people would try to get around them by finding
other ways of giving _ through relatives or friends, for example.
The groups instead favor lowering the limits for all donors.
</P>
<P>
   Blakeman said his rules did not require the approval of the
Legislature. He acknowledged, though, that he was not limiting his
fund raising as a candidate. He has accepted tens of thousands of
dollars in contributions from donors with interests before the
Nassau County Legislature, of which is the presiding officer.

IN DEBATE, KENNELLY SEES 2 CONNECTICUTS, WITH ONE STRUGGLING 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ U.S. Rep. Barbara Kennelly, who throughout her
campaign for Connecticut governor has touched on many issues but
never found a theme, Tuesday night unified her concerns about the
state's future by asserting that the prosperity trumpeted by Gov.
John Rowland amounts to only half of ``a tale of two states.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly, a Democrat, used the second of four debates to
present what amounted to a closing argument for her candidacy, and
her staff said she planned to stick to the theme every day through
the election on Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Connecticut that John Rowland talks about, all is
well,'' she said at the Old State House in Hartford, where she
announced her candidacy 13 months ago. But she said that other
residents, particularly those with children, are struggling.
``Rowland doesn't want to talk about that state _ it doesn't fit on
a 30-second ad. But more and more people are being pushed into that
other Connecticut every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, 41, who entered the race's homestretch with six times
as much cash as Mrs. Kennelly, replied that one of the problems
with her campaign is that she has emphasized the negative at a time
when polls show most people are happy with the state's direction.
He said all residents had benefited from his policies of cutting
taxes and encouraging small businesses, which he said would cushion
a recession by making the state less dependent on the defense and
insurance industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my goals as governor over the next four years is to
make sure that everyone enjoys the same quality of life,'' he said.
``We're building up momentum, we're creating excitement, we're
putting this state on the map and we're going to continue
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly, 62, said her plans included a patients' bill of
rights that would allow people to sue health maintenance
organizations, and a scholarship plan that would provide a free
state education to students who maintain high grades in high school
and college. Those plans would improve the lives of people who are
forced to work two jobs, find a college education to be out of
reach or have been denied health coverage, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I'm running for governor: because we shouldn't be
two Connecticuts,'' she said. ``We should be one Connecticut.''
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates were more aggressive in Tuesday night's debate
than they were in last week's, which was only the second debate of
Mrs. Kennelly's 23-year political career. On Tuesday, each
repeatedly disputed the other's facts.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on a huge lead in polls, Rowland hung back at the first
debate and did not rebut many statements by Mrs. Kennelly that he
later confessed had him itching to respond. ``During the last
debate, I let a few shots slide,'' he said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Kennelly has voted for every single major tax increase _
every single major tax increase _ over 17 years,'' he said. When
Mrs. Kennelly tried to interrupt to dispute that statement, Rowland
would not give up any of his time, and cut her off by saying,
``it's my minute.''

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Oct. 14:
</P>
<P>
   Executing a mentally impaired person for a crime committed while
still a juvenile does not serve the interests of justice. Gov.
James Gilmore of Virginia should recognize that as he weighs the
clemency application of Dwayne Allen Wright, who is scheduled to be
executed Wednesday evening by lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   Wright had just turned 17 in 1989 when he went on a four-day
spree of violence that resulted in three murders. He was later
convicted of two of the homicides and confessed to the third. No
one is challenging his guilt. At issue is whether to execute
someone who was a teen-ager when he committed the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   America remains one of only a handful of countries _ Iran,
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Yemen are others _ that have refused to
ban executions of juvenile offenders. Eleven juvenile offenders
have been executed since 1976, when the death penalty was
reinstituted in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the issue of age is Wright's mental history. At the
age of 13 he was diagnosed with organic brain damage and acute
mental illness requiring treatment he never received in the
juvenile detention facilities where he was confined. Also, like
many others on death row, Wright had the misfortune of being
represented by an inexperienced counsel. The serious nature of his
impairment and its impact on his behavior was never conveyed to the
jury, which might well have declined to impose death had it known.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court could still grant a stay to allow it to
consider legal questions that remain in the Wright case. But the
chances are that Gilmore will have the final word on Wright's fate.
Surely the circumstances here ought to trouble even a staunch death
penalty supporter like Gilmore. He has the power to commute
Wright's sentence to life imprisonment without parole. He ought to
use it.

<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Tony Boselli is the Jacksonville Jaguars'
supreme offensive tackle, and he is intelligent, animated and
talkative. He grew up in Boulder, Colo., and earned a degree in
business administration from Southern California. He was the
Jaguars' first-ever draft pick and was the second player chosen
over all in the 1995 draft.
</P>
<P>
   But only a few days before being drafted, he did not know where
Jacksonville was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was probably in Alabama,'' he said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   And he was not joking.
</P>
<P>
   Keenan McCardell is the Jaguars' splendid receiver, obtained as
a free agent in 1996. He was born in Houston, played at Nevada-Las
Vegas and earned a degree in business management. McCardell is
intelligent, animated and talkative. But before arriving in
Jacksonville, he too, did not know that this city was in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time I'd ever heard of Jacksonville is from the
Jacksonville Bulls of the old United States Football League,''
McCardell said. ``I thought Jacksonville was maybe in
Mississippi.''
</P>
<P>
   And he was not joking.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Huyghue is the Jaguars' senior vice president of
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember telling my wife, Kimberly, that I was taking the
job and that we were moving to Jacksonville,'' Huyghue said. ``She
jumped out of bed and grabbed an atlas.''
</P>
<P>
   He was joking. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville may not have been the end of the pro football
world, but it certainly was a stop easy to miss. This city
steamrolled seemingly from nowhere and beat the odds _ beating
favored cities bidding for teams including Baltimore and St. Louis
and Memphis _ and along with Charlotte, N.C., won a new franchise
in 1993 and began play in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars trudged to a 4-12 record the first year. Then they
were 11-8 and lost at New England in the American Conference
championship game in 1996. Last year they were 11-6 and lost a
first-round playoff game at Denver. And now the Jaguars are among
the NFL's elite.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from a 28-21 victory over the visiting Miami Dolphins on
Monday night, the Jaguars are 5-0, leaving them, the Denver Broncos
and the Minnesota Vikings as the only teams still unbeaten in the
NFL. In their last 26 regular-season games, the Jaguars are 21-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you can't get people to leave,'' Huyghue said.
</P>
<P>
   Alltel Stadium, where the Jaguars play, is a sparkling, spiffy
place. It is modern, charming and efficient. Football fans here for
years had identified with the NFL through Miami and the Dolphins,
through Don Shula and his Super Bowl teams. Now Jacksonville's
identity complex has come full circle: the Jaguars beat the
Dolphins on national television in full view for their fans and for
the world to see. Everyone saw an exciting, young, fast team that
can play the game in a variety of entertaining ways. Everyone saw
Jacksonville, too.
</P>
<P>
   Psssst. It's in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe now they see why the Jaguars will be heard from in the
playoffs this fall. The Jaguars have a two-game lead on Pittsburgh
in the AFC Central and play at Buffalo on Sunday. They have a
mobile, strong-armed, quick-legged and daring quarterback in Mark
Brunell. They have a big-play defense and strong leadership from
the top in owner Wayne Weaver, Huyghue and head coach Tom Coughlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can go as far and be as good as we're willing to work,''
Boselli said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars do work. Coughlin is viewed as a taskmaster, and he
works his players full throttle. He has made the game into his own
science and those close to him say that there is no area of his
team _ from working with snappers and holders to monitoring his
defensive backs' backpedal _ that he does not master. He is
detailed and prepared and his team is playing that way.
</P>
<P>
   The team is exhibiting a penchant for winning close games. The
Jaguars won by 1 point in the season opener at Chicago, by 5 points
at home against Kansas City and by 5 at Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   And then the Jaguars slipped by the Dolphins on Monday night
showing that they know how to start and how to finish. Jacksonville
scored the game's first 14 points, Miami scored the next 21 and
then Jacksonville scored the final 14. McCardell produced touchdown
catches of 23 and 56 yards from Brunell early and late in the
fourth quarter to win it. The final one came with 2 minutes 36
seconds left, the first play after Miami's Olindo Mare missed a
54-yard field-goal attempt that would have given Miami a 24-21
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have players hand-picked by the coaches and the
organization that fit their mold,'' McCardell said. ``Guys who work
and are willing to sacrifice. Something special is in the air
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Brunell added: ``The way we played the fourth quarter against
Miami is the way this football team is: It's a group of fighters.''
</P>
<P>
   If they get there, if they get all the way to Super Bowl XXXIII
on Jan. 31, guess where the game will be played? In Miami, of
course, in Pro Player Stadium. Right in Florida, in the Dolphins'
front yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's official. We're state rivals now, almost like something
from the colleges,'' linebacker Kevin Hardy said. ``Jacksonville is
a nice place and Miami may be a bigger city. We want to be the
bigger team.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the Jaguars are.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Oct. 14:
</P>
<P>
   There are great advantages for New York in being the financial
capital of the world. But there is a downside. When financial
markets are roiled, and investors grow hesitant, Wall Street
inevitably cuts back. Those cuts are likely to have a larger impact
on the New York region than on other areas. It would be wise for
city and state officials to start planning now for reduced tax
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The rounds of Wall Street layoffs are just beginning, and could
be larger than those that followed the 1987 stock market crash.
Merrill Lynch, which Tuesday announced plans to lay off 3,400
employees and 900 consultants _ about 1,500 in the metropolitan
area _ believes it erred in 1987 by not reacting quickly enough.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street is being hurt by more than lower stock prices.
Securities firms make much of their business underwriting new
securities and selling them to investors. But the volume of such
underwritings has fallen sharply as investors have shunned bonds
from all but the safest companies. Merrill pointed to bond markets
and to emerging markets _ Asia and Latin America _ as the areas
where the cuts would be steepest.
</P>
<P>
   By one measure, the securities industry is not a very big part
of the local economy. Stephen Kagann, Gov. George Pataki's top
economist, notes that just 3.3 percent of the people with jobs in
the city and its New York suburbs work for Wall Street firms.
</P>
<P>
   But Wall Street's economic importance is far greater than that
figure would indicate. Not only are there workers in related
industries, such as banking and insurance, but the Wall Street jobs
have been both the best-paying and the fastest-growing. The average
income for those who work in the securities business in New York
was $172,000 last year, or about four times the average for all
downstate New York employees. That figure is inflated because many
of Wall Street's lower-paying back-office jobs are now in New
Jersey, but it remains impressive.
</P>
<P>
   That figure is likely to fall. Much of the Wall Street payments
come in the form of bonuses paid early in the calendar year. Even
for those who keep their jobs, next year's bonuses are likely to be
sharply lower. That has negative implications for high-end
retailers and expensive home sales, as well as for state and city
income-tax collections. New York politicians accustomed to the
budget surpluses that have been generated in part by the Wall
Street boom had better trim back their expectations.

RANGERS' PROBLEMS COVER THE ICE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even if the Rangers signed Zigmund Palffy from the
Islanders and Scott Niedermayer from the Devils today, they would
still be three or four players short of a good team. And they
aren't about to sign either restricted free agent and risk the
wrath of other National Hockey League teams.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy is a sharpshooter and Niedermayer is a puck-carrying
defensemen. The Rangers could use both, as they have demonstrated
in being outscored by 12-3 while starting their season 0-3.
</P>
<P>
   But even with those two, the Rangers would still need a young
power forward to crash the corners and the opposing goal crease.
They would still need a dependable, veteran center to win face-offs
and anchor a second line. They would still need a young,
defense-oriented defenseman with skating skills to clear the slot
with intimidating checks. And they would still need a goalie to
give up fewer than the eight goals that Mike Richter has allowed in
his last two periods of work.
</P>
<P>
   So with the hockey season less than a week old, two of the local
teams are already in distress while it is too soon to judge the
third.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, as always, get the most attention, so let's start
at Madison Square Garden. Their 4-2 loss to St. Louis on Monday,
more embarrassing than the score suggests, exposed several flaws in
what remains an old, slow, soft team. Left wing Esa Tikkanen,
signed as a free agent in training camp and awarded a first-line
spot next to Wayne Gretzky, had to be demoted to center on a lower
line in the third period Monday. Gretzky and the coaching staff
lobbied for Tikkanen in the preseason. They all remember Tikkanen
fondly from their happy days in Edmonton, a decade or so ago. So
much for cronyism and wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Richter, earning more than $5 million on a free-agent contract,
looked great for the first five periods of the season. Since then,
his play has been alarming, particularly on the long shot from the
neutral zone that gave Al MacInnis his second of three goals
Monday. Will Coach John Muckler go with young Dan Cloutier when the
Rangers play host to the Devils on Friday night?
</P>
<P>
   But their biggest problems are at the other end of the ice,
where they are averaging fewer than 20 shots per game. Brian
Leetch, the captain, happened to mention: ``We don't have a guy
who's going to get 50 for us, or something.'' Last season, they
lacked one who could score 25.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy could score more, and the Islanders don't seem inclined
to sign him. Their reckless and belligerent management is too busy
picking fights with politicians and landlords and treating Long
Island fans as suckers. And so Palffy sits idle in Slovakia while
the Islanders start the season at 0-2. It must be just a
coincidence that so many NHL teams are refusing to bid for each
other's restricted free agents and so many good ones are without
jobs. Certainly the compensation requirements are stiff _ up to
five first-round draft choices. And collusion is so hard to prove,
isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   There were several unrestricted free agents, good ones, too,
available last summer. Players such as Ron Francis and Uwe Krupp
might have filled Ranger needs. But Rangers president and general
manager Neil Smith did not compete financially for them. Perhaps
the new Cablevision owners have stepped on his cash cord. With Phil
Esposito finally being dismissed as Tampa Bay general manager
Tuesday, the buzz around the league will soon be: Who's next?
</P>
<P>
   As for the Devils, 0-1 so far, they seem stable. A contract
dispute such as Niedermayer's is nearly a yearly thing for Lou
Lamoriello, who talked so tough during the 1994 lockout. He is one
of few general managers able to enforce the collective bargaining
agreement to his advantage. Most of his stars work for less than
market rate, as Niedermayer probably will when he signs. If they
don't like it, he ships them out. Devils' owner John McMullen
threatened to move the team to Nashville while winning the 1995
Stanley Cup. But compared with the heavy-handed newcomers on Long
Island and the cold-blooded calculators running the Garden,
McMullen seems like a warm and fuzzy philanthropist.
</P>
<P>
   It is the Garden, with its corporate tentacles, that most
threatens all local hockey fans. The Cablevision ownership now
controls television rights to all three hockey teams, as well as to
all basketball and baseball teams. With monopoly control,
Cablevision is now dropping Islander telecasts, with little notice,
at whim. Cablevision, not the viewer, decides what the viewer
watches. Certainly such shabby treatment is what Islander
management deserves, but it is an abuse of the fans and is ominous
for the future of local sports on television.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps this is too harsh or ``hysterical,'' as Commissioner
Gary Bettman likes to call news media critics. So let's look at the
bright side. Maybe all three local hockey teams will be so bad this
season that even hockey fans won't care to watch.

BAKER NOT INTERESTED
</HEADLINE>
 (NEW LEAD) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; ! &LR; NEW YORK _ One day after the Dodgers appeared ready to ask
the San Francisco Giants for permission to talk to Dusty Baker
about their vacant manager's position, Baker said there is no need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't bother calling, I have no interest in managing the
Dodgers,'' Baker told the San Francisco Chronicle on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It was unlikely the Giants were going to grant permission even
if Baker hadn't responded to reports of the Dodgers' interest.
</P>
<P>
   Giants general manager Brian Sabean said Tuesday at the club's
organizational meetings. ``(Baker) is under contract, that's all I
can say,'' alluding to the two-year extension that kicks in this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Baker led the Giants to a wild-card playoff game against the
Chicago Cubs this past season after winning the National League
West in 1997. He will earn $700,000 this coming season. At the time
Baker signed the extension, the Giants said they wanted him to be
with the club in 2000 when they open their new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Because he is under contract, the Dodgers have to receive
permission to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone has not set up
an interview with Davey Johnson, who also is being considered for
the manager's job in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   After rushing to hire Felipe Alou, who stayed with Montreal,
Malone said he will be more patient in the next round of
discussions. He hopes to have a manager in place by his own
organizational meetings, Oct. 28-Nov. 1 in Vero Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Tigers' payroll is not expected to climb above $30
million next season, Johnson clearly is hoping the Dodgers act
soon. They are expected to have a $75 million payroll in
1999. &UR; !dlim! &LR; !end!

MICROSOFT RELEASES MORE GATES MEMOS TO PORTRAY AN UNDERDOG
STRUGGLE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its latest pretrial salvo, the Microsoft Corp. issued a
40-page document Tuesday that attempts to refute the government's
antitrust case _ a case that Microsoft asserts is based on ``a
handful of snippets'' quoted ``misleadingly'' from among the 3.3
million pages of e-mail and memos the company handed over to the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   In the paper, titled ``Setting the Record Straight,'' Microsoft
replies partly with some snippets of its own in the form of
previously unreleased e-mail concerning the company's dealings with
Intuit Inc. and America Online Inc. In both cases, Microsoft
portrays itself as an upstart underdog in the market for software
used to browse the Internet's World Wide Web rather than as a
predator intent on defending and extending its monopoly, as the
government has painted it. The company notes that until recently,
its rival Netscape Communications Corp. was the dominant maker of
browser software for navigating the Web.
</P>
<P>
   In relation to Intuit, the leader in personal-finance software,
the government suit quotes an internal Microsoft e-mail message
written in July 1996 by the company's chairman, Bill Gates. It
describes a meeting between Gates and Scott Cook, chief executive
of Intuit, which had recently started shipping the Netscape browser
with its Quicken financial software.
</P>
<P>
   In the government suit, the quotation from the Gates e-mail
reads, ``I was quite frank with him that if he had a favor we could
do for him that would cost us something like $1 million to do that
in return for switching browsers in the next few months, I would be
open to doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft document characterizes this e-mail extract as an
effort by the government to ``imply falsely that Microsoft
attempted to `bribe' Intuit.'' Most of the Gates e-mail, the
company says, concerned Gates' efforts to persuade Cook that
Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser was technologically superior
to Netscape's Navigator browser.
</P>
<P>
   ``When read in its entirety, the e-mail makes clear that Cook _
not Gates _ was doing the hard bargaining,'' the Microsoft rebuttal
contends. ``This is mainly because of the context in which the
Microsoft-Intuit discussions took place,'' at a time when Netscape
was by far the leader in the browser market.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, the document adds, was ``seeking ways to increase the
distribution and promotion of its Internet Explorer technologies,
in order to increase competition in the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion that Gates, the nation's wealthiest person and the
head of the company that dominates the personal computer software
industry, would be the supplicant in any business meeting leaves
Microsoft's critics unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would expect Microsoft to take positions that at least
pass the laugh test,'' said Kevin Arquit, a partner at Rogers &AMP;
Wells, who is a consultant to Sun Microsystems Inc., a Microsoft
rival. ``This paper suggests that Microsoft is worried about the
evidence that is going to come out in the trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial is scheduled to begin on Monday in U.S. District Court
in Washington. William Harris, president of Intuit, has been named
as a witness for the Justice Department and 20 states suing
Microsoft.

ROBERT ALLEN, TEXAS RANGER IN WESTERNS, DEAD AT 92
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Allen, a Dartmouth-trained actor whose youthful
experience playing polo, hunting foxes and riding in the cavalry at
a military academy helped him land the role of the original Texas
Ranger in 1930s westerns, died on Friday in Oyster Bay, N.Y. He was
92.
</P>
<P>
   Allen appeared in more than 40 films in the 1930s _ including
the 1935 version of ``Crime and Punishment,'' playing Dmitri
alongside Peter Lorre as Raskolnikov _ and had a long career in the
theater after World War II, starring in the original production of
``Auntie Mame.'' But he is best remembered for the six ``Bob Allen,
Ranger'' films made in 1936 and 1937, hourlong dramas in which he
calmly saved a series of frontier towns from cattle rustlers,
bandits, rampaging Indians and other menaces.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, whose original name was Irvine E. Theodore Baehr, was
born in Mount Vernon, N.Y., graduated from Dartmouth in 1929 with a
degree in English and got a job at a bank. It was a bad time for
the profession: The bank failed when the Depression hit. Allen then
worked as a commercial pilot, but that company, too, went bankrupt.
Finally he took the advice of a friend and headed to Hollywood to
pursue the acting career he had abandoned after college to mollify
his family.
</P>
<P>
   Allen quickly found plenty of work and starred in a string of
movies. He appeared in ``The Perils of Pauline'' and ``Love Me
Forever'' and was nominated for an Academy Award for his
performance in the title role of ``The Life of Lafayette'' in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   Also that year, after roles in several westerns opposite Tim
McCoy, Allen was rewarded by Columbia Pictures with his own series.
The first ``Bob Allen, Ranger'' movie, ``The Unknown Ranger,'' was
warmly received, and five more followed, including ``Rio Grande
Ranger,'' ``Reckless Ranger'' and ``The Rangers Step In.''
</P>
<P>
   But by late 1937, it was not enough for a movie cowboy merely to
talk, rope and ride. Columbia was looking for a singing cowboy to
compete with Gene Autry, and Allen's ability to handle a horse was
not enough to compensate for his inability to play the guitar. He
was replaced by a young man from Ohio named Roy Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Allen appeared in more than two dozen movies after that,
including a Walt Disney feature, ``Brimstone, the Amish Horse.'' He
also acted in television shows, documentary films and commercials.
</P>
<P>
   But he found he much preferred the theater, said his son, Dr.
Theodore Baehr, and he spent most of the rest of his career
onstage. He had major roles in the original Broadway productions of
``Show Boat'' and ``Kiss Them for Me.'' And beginning in 1956, he
was the villainous lawyer, Babcock, in ``Auntie Mame,'' opposite
Rosalind Russell and then Greer Garson. He appeared in dozens of
other plays, on Broadway, Off Broadway and around the country. He
also became a real estate broker in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son, he is survived by a daughter, Katherine
Meyer, seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.

MIAMI HERALD TO CLOSE SUNDAY MAGAZINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the most painful of a series of recent belt-tightening moves,
The Miami Herald's top editors said Tuesday that the newspaper's
Sunday feature magazine, Tropic, would close before year's end.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's executive editor, Douglas Clifton, said the move
would save at least $2 million annually, more than half of which
would be used to beef up the sports and business pages.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the newspaper, which has used its
geographical base to become a showplace for news from the Caribbean
region, closed its international edition, which was distributed to
population centers in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Herald,
which is owned by Knight Ridder Inc., has also shut down bureaus in
Israel and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Tropic, which had been among the most high-profile members of
the dwindling club of Sunday magazines, is where the humor
columnist Dave Barry rose to prominence. (His column will still be
published in the Sunday newspaper.) Over its 30-year history, the
magazine has published work that won three Pulitzer Prizes.
</P>
<P>
   But like many Sunday magazines, which began to lose their
lucrative color advertising to special pre-printed advertising
sections, Tropic had long been a money-loser, Clifton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got here in 1985,'' said Tom Shroder, executive editor
of Tropic, ``I was told, `You're taking a job at a place that might
not be here six months from now.'''
</P>
<P>
   Elinor Blecher, a feature writer who just finished a four-month
stint at Tropic, said the decision had had a more profound impact
on the newsroom than other cuts. When a foreign bureau is
eliminated, she said, ``there are always wire services.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is much closer to home,'' Ms. Blecher said.
</P>
<P>
   Clifton said Tuesday that the five-member staff would have new
jobs in other departments of the newspaper. Shroder has been hired
as the Style section editor at The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to do the long stories that we habitually run
in the Sunday paper,'' Clifton said Tuesday in a telephone
interview. ``Now we'll just have a different venue for them.''

TORN ACL SIDELINES LAPERRIERE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Kings learned Tuesday that
fourth-line center Ian Laperriere has a partially torn anterior
cruciate ligament in his left knee and will be sidelined on a
week-to-week basis.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old Laperriere, a defensive specialist who played
the first two games of the new season on a line with Sandy Moger
and Matt Johnson, was injured in the second period of Monday
afternoon's 4-2 loss at Vancouver when he collided with a Canucks
player.
</P>
<P>
   A magnetic-resonance imaging examination revealed the damage.
According to a Kings spokesman, Laperriere will try to rehabilitate
the knee without surgery and is hoping to play while wearing a
brace. Laperriere will try to skate in about 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Laperriere was acquired by the Kings in a seven-player deal on
March 14, 1996 and played in ten games before the end of the
season. He had 21 points (six goals, 15 assists) in 77 games last
season. He has no points in two games so far this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings have a day off today and are scheduled to practice
Thursday morning at Iceoplex in preparation for Friday night's home
opener against the Boston Bruins.

COWBOYS' JONES TALKS OF RE-SIGNING NEWTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Clarence E. Hill Jr. and Kevin Lyons 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said yesterday that
the team is so pleased with guard Nate Newton's play and
conditioning that they will try to re-sign him in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   There was much talk after the Washington game Oct. 4 about how
the Cowboys wore down the Redskins' $57 million defensive-tackle
combo of Dana Stubblefield and Dan Wilkinson, who both looked tired
and out of shape in the fourth quarter. One of the players
responsible for wearing them out was the 36-year-old Newton, who
was supposedly so old and out of shape last year that the Cowboys
forced him to get him in shape. At 318 pounds, Newton is 52 pounds
under last season's playing weight of 370. He can become a free
agent after this season.
Davis unlikely to play
Wide receiver Billy Davis most likely will not play Sunday against
the Chicago Bears because of a strained left foot, coach Chan
Gailey said. Davis will be replaced in the starting lineup by Ernie
Mills.  &LR; name:_ Clarence E. Hill Jr.
More Deion on offense
Gailey said wide receiver/cornerback/punt returner Deion Sanders
will get more work on offense in practice this week and during the
bye week after Sunday's game against Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said he wants Sanders, who has played primarily in the
four-receiver sets, to get more time in the two- and three-receiver
packages. Teams can't load up on receiver Michael Irvin with
Sanders in the game, Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders has caught four passes for 71 yards in the past four
games.  &LR; name:_ Kevin Lyons

NBA BATTLE FOR BUCKS IS FAN-TEDIOUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't know about you, but my neighbors did not drape their front
hedges in black over the news yesterday that the NBA is canceling
games.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, there were no ``Free Scottie Pippen'' signs. No one,
as far as I could tell, went door to door asking for spare change
to help feed David Stern.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, we are left speechless as we ponder the vexing issues.
Somebody help me with this.
</P>
<P>
   The owners, who signed a $2.64 billion TV deal with NBC and
Turner, are locking out the players, who stand firm on their
negotiated right to command contracts of $100 million?
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, home of the beloved Rockets, this is news. In
Chicago, where Michael Jordan is the elixir that warms their
blustery winters, this is news.
</P>
<P>
   But here, as in most of the country, this is dog bites man. Or
better still, dog bites dog.
</P>
<P>
   Yawn. Somebody wake us when something new happens.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, the only thing new in the NBA these days is
commissioner Stern's gray beard. The star of the show, Jordan,
threatens retirement. The next generation, namely Kevin Garnett,
turned his back on college, turned his back on a $100 million
contract offer and eventually signed with the Minnesota
Timberwolves for $126 million.
</P>
<P>
   He is 20 years old. The Larry Bird rule protected his right to
do so. The Bird exemption has made a mockery of the proud NBA's
salary cap and made $100 million players of people like Juwan
Howard.
</P>
<P>
   Juwan, you're no Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is Shaquille O'Neal, another of the NBA's
100-Million-Dollar Babies. But for once in his adult life, Shaq
showed astounding depth and insight last week as he answered an
Associated Press reporter's question about the effects of the NBA
impasse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans would be very upset, and our game would be slightly
tarnished, like baseball and hockey when they left their fans,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to alienate the fans. ... Once you start this,
20,000 to 30,000 fans at the arenas becomes 8,000 or 9,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaq isn't old enough to remember, or care, but the NBA was not
always the planet's league of choice. Once upon a time, circa the
late 1970s, franchises hopped from Buffalo to San Diego, from New
Orleans to Utah. Teams flew by commercial _ and some by cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   But along came His Airness, Jordan. He flew all by himself. And
with him, so did the NBA soar _ into malls and onto cable TV,
across the oceans, and even into the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   What are you NBA idiots doing?
</P>
<P>
   It is the owners who keep raising ticket prices, who keep
leasing luxury suites and who keep finding more room for courtside
seats. It is the owners who, when Garnett balks at $100 million,
say here, take $126 million.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of a hard salary cap is wrong. Anybody want to argue
that Michael Jordan is not worth $126 million? $150 million? $200
million?
</P>
<P>
   Players are worth what owners _ foolhardy owners? _ are willing
to pay them. Remember Jon Koncak? Once again, though, we have a
sport where the owners want the players to help the owners save
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cost certainty,'' NBA owners are calling it. ``Profit
certainty'' seems a more accurate term.
</P>
<P>
   The frog in the NBA witch's brew is that the players of the '90s
have only a cursory connection with their fans. Even Jordan, who
wages wars of words and nerves with Jerry Krause and Jerry
Reinsdorf, barely acknowledges that it's the fans whose ``costs''
know no cap.
</P>
<P>
   Shaq, the '90s philosopher, is right. If the NBA cancels its
Christmas, or more, the fans might not come back.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball, even with its self-destructive ways, had the advantage
of being the game many of us were born with. Pro football survived
its labor problems because it owns Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Pro basketball, let me suggest, is not the communion of choice
in most American cities.
</P>
<P>
   Out of sight, out of mind. Oh _ out of Jordans?

GARRETT SHOWING HIS DEEP SIDE

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys quarterback Jason Garrett has shown he
can throw the deep ball.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the then-shocking performance on Thanksgiving Day 1994
when he passed for 311 yards and two touchdowns in leading the
Cowboys to a comeback victory against Green Bay? Garrett threw deep
balls of 35 yards to Alvin Harper and 45 yards to Michael Irvin for
touchdowns in that victory.
</P>
<P>
   And since taking over for injured starter Troy Aikman, Garrett
has continued to go deep. In the past four games, Garrett has
completed 21 passes for 17 yards or more _ including nine Sunday in
the 27-20 victory against the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett maintains that he does nothing special, saying he merely
puts the ball up and lets receivers make plays. But the Cowboys say
their success has a lot to do with Garrett's skill in making the
throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason can throw the deep pass,'' said receiver Billy Davis,
who has hauled in receptions of 36, 55 and 80 yards from Garrett.
</P>
<P>
   Said Cowboys coach Chan Gailey: ``He knows how much heat to put
on the ball and whether to throw it hard or soft. He has great
touch.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the Cowboys aren't throwing the deep pass merely
because Garrett is in the lineup. Receivers coach Dwain Painter
said the go route, in which a wide receiver speeds straight
downfield, is one of five basic routes of the Cowboys' offense.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks coach Buddy Geis said that Aikman and Garrett have
been working on the deep throw since spring and that both have
improved their ability to make the throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do that drill every day,'' Geis said. ``The more you throw
it, the more you work on it, the better you get. Jason and Troy
throw the ball as well as I've seen. Both have such fine touch on
it and have good location of the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the premise seems simple _ throw the ball up and let the
receiver make a play on it _ there are several keys to making the
play successful.
</P>
<P>
   For sideline routes, Painter said the key is positioning by the
receiver, who must ride the defender to the inside and fade to the
ball thrown one or two yards off the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Noting Ernie Mills' 18-yard touchdown catch against the
Panthers, Geis said it's also about trajectory and timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great example was Ernie on the touchdown,'' Geis said.
``Ernie wasn't down the field 6 or 7 yards and the ball was out of
Jason's hands. Eighteen yards later he's catching it in the end
zone.''
</P>
<P>
   And if defenses continue to play eight-man fronts to stop
running back Emmitt Smith and continue to leave cornerbacks
one-on-one with Cowboys receivers, the deep ball will remain a big
part of the Cowboys' arsenal.

OFFENSIVE LINE CAPTURES RATINGS COUP IN TEXAS A&AMP;M VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Texas A&AMP;M offensive line coach J.B.
Grimes never intended for his starters to take every snap against
Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they were holding up good and they kept telling me they
weren't tired,'' Grimes said. ``So I decided, `I'm dancing with
you, then.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M eventually danced into the night with a 28-21 upset of the
defending national champions, a victory that vaulted the Aggies
(5-1, 2-0) to No. 10 in The Associated Press college football
rankings heading into Saturday's game against Baylor (2-3, 1-2).
</P>
<P>
   Much of the background music that triggered the triumph was
played by members of a rebuilt offensive line that opened running
lanes for two 100-yard rushers and turned in its best performance
this season. For the first time in A&AMP;M's six games, every offensive
lineman that played received a ``winning performance'' rating from
Grimes, who bestows the honor only if a player achieves his goal as
a blocker on 75 percent of the Aggies' offensive snaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen our line play that well against this type of
team since I've been here,'' said tight end Dan Campbell, a
fifth-year senior from Glen Rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always knew the talent was there. They just needed to get
their blocking schemes down,'' said taiback Dante Hall, who rushed
for a game-high 113 yards against Nebraska. ``At the first of the
year, they fired off the line, made contact and that was it. Now,
there's contact and a push. The other guys are moving backwards.
That's a big-time difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers support Hall's claim. The ground-bound Aggies did
not have a 100-yard rusher in any game until Oct. 3, when Hall
romped for 177 yards in a 24-21 victory against Kansas. They got
two more against Nebraska, from Hall (32 carries, 113 yards) and
fullback Ja'Mar Toombs (10 carries, 110 yards), upping the season
total to three.
</P>
<P>
   That is a far cry from the season opener, when A&AMP;M managed only
33 yards on 31 carries in a 23-14 loss to Florida State. Grimes,
who is blending the talents of three first-year starters and a
fourth player who shifted positions this season, said incremental
improvement has been evident each week.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M had only two linemen earn ``winning performance''
recognition in its first two games. The past four weeks, at least
five players have earned such acclaim, although the only
across-the-board declaration for every participant came after the
Nebraska game.
</P>
<P>
   That coincided with the iron-man efforts of the Aggies' front
five, who did not sit out a single snap: left tackle Rex Tucker,
left guard Cameron Spikes, center Seth McKinney, right guard Semisi
Heimuli and right tackle Andy Vincent.
</P>
<P>
   Of that group, Heimuli is the only player who started at the
same spot in 1997. Spikes moved from right tackle to left guard
during spring drills. The others moved up in the depth chart
because of voids left by departing seniors.
</P>
<P>
   McKinney, a redshirt freshman, is the youngest. Spikes and
Tucker are the only seniors. All have felt lost at times, McKinney
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beginning of the year was bad, especially for me,''
McKinney said. ``I was getting yelled at all the time for letting
my pads get too high. We'd been feeling a lot of pressure because
we weren't putting points on the board.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M still has not topped the 30-point mark this season. But no
one is complaining about hanging 28 points on a Nebraska defense
that has allowed an average of 14.8 per game. The best part, Spikes
said, was the confidence boost the Aggies gained by winning the war
in the trenches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means the world to us. From an offensive line standpoint,
we controlled the line of scrimmage,'' Spikes said. ``And we did it
against a great team like Nebraska. It was by far the best game
we've played.''
</P>
<P>
   By no means, Grimes said, will the Nebraska game signal an end
to a rotation system among A&AMP;M offensive linemen. Grimes, who came
to A&AMP;M after overseeing offensive lines at Virginia Tech (1993-97)
and Arkansas (1989-92), described his decision to avoid
substitutions against the Cornhuskers as rare but not unprecedented
in his coaching tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys are still learning to work together, so they need
to keep playing. The more they play together, the better they'll
get,'' Grimes said. ``If they stay healthy, they're making the kind
of progress where they can be big-time good before this year's
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, they've been good enough to provide the background
music to a victory dance against the defending national champs.

   LOS ANGELES -- Fourteen years after the Alameda Corridor rail
line was proposed, $700 million in contracts will be signed
Wednesday to begin construction in the $2 billion project.
</P>
<P>
   After years of pleading for funds and resolving disputes, the
Alameda Corridor Transportation Authority board is ready to sign
the contract with Tutor-Saliba for the high-speed rail line, 20
miles long, connecting the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach with
Union Station.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the largest public works transit project in
history,'' Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr. said Tuesday after the
City Council approved a series of resolutions giving the authority
board power to issue the contracts and $1.3 billion in bonds to
begin the work.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles was the last city to sign off on the project. The
rail line eventually will go through seven cities to transport
goods to and from the harbors and across the United States.

   ``Some have likened this to the Panama Canal,'' Svorinich said.
``When it's completed, upwards of 30 percent of all goods coming
into the United States will use the Alameda Corridor.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan, favoring the rail line since his 1993
election, has said it will be a major step in the region's
evolution as an international trade hub.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, it's one step closer to reality,'' said Riordan
spokeswoman Noelia Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Svorinich said the city had to overcome a lot of suspicion and
jealousy. ``Not everyone was happy with this, but I think everyone
came to believe it is of importance to them,'' Svorinich said.
</P>
<P>
   Construction is scheduled to begin in early 1999 and to be
completed by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the project will create more than 8,100 jobs, and
officials project it could lead eventually to more than 100,000
jobs in businesses related to importing and exporting.
</P>
<P>
   The rail line alone is expected to bring in $70 million a year
in revenue, officials said.

   &UR; INTERNATIONAL _ (Moved in ``i'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-ASSESS (Brussels, Belgium) _ The Clinton administration
has won enormous concessions from the Yugoslav President, Slobodan
Milosevic, but the agreement on Kosovo seems fraught with the
dangers that have long bedevilled the West in Bosnia. A news
analysis by Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   GAZA-INDUSTRIAL-PARK (Gaza City, Gaza Strip) _ The grandly named
Gaza Industrial Estate will employ up to a thousand Palestinians in
several small-scale manufacturing ventures. It is a measure of the
Gaza Strip's economic desperation that this tentative, modest
project looms so large for Palestinian planners. By William A. Orme
Jr.

<P>
   PANAMA-CLEANUP (Panama City, Panama) _ For nearly a century, the
U.S. military has used the jungle terrain surrounding the Panama
Canal as a testing ground for explosives and chemical weapons. Now,
a little more than a year before those ranges must be handed back
to Panama, Washington is balking at cleaning up some of the most
hazardous of the ordnance its troops are leaving behind. By Larry
Rohter.

</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-CLINTON (Broomfield, Colo.) _ While the election in
three weeks has been portrayed in Washington as a referendum on
whether President Clinton should be impeached, the scandal has not
become a central part of the discourse _ or the candidates'
strategies _ in the closest House and Senate contests in the
country. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   TRAILER-GIRL (Dixon, Ill.) _ Watching classmates strut past in
designer clothes, Wendy Williams sat silently on the yellow school
bus, wearing a cheap belt and rummage-sale slacks. One boy stopped
and yanked his thumb, demanding her seat. ``Move it, trailer
girl,'' he sneered. It has never been easy to live on the wrong
side of the tracks, but in the economically robust 1990s, with
sprawling new houses and three-car garages sprouting like
cornstalks on the Midwestern prairie, the sting that comes with
scarcity gets rubbed with an extra bit of salt. By Dirk Johnson.

   CANADA-BANKS (Toronto) _ John Cleghorn showed what a formidable
competitor he can be when he played center on the McGill University
football team that won the intercollegiate championship in 1960.
Now that he is chairman of the Royal Bank of Canada, the country's
largest, and campaigning vigorously for government approval to make
it a lot larger by merging with the Bank of Montreal, he is acting
as though he still thinks no one can get past him. By Anthony
DePalma.

   BANKAMERICA-HEDGE-LOSS (Undated) _ BankAmerica Corp., the
nation's fifth-largest bank, is expected to announce a big hedge
fund loss Wednesday in the latest example of the dangers posed to
financial companies from the risky, often high-flying investment
pools. By Timothy L. O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   KODAK-EARNINGS-MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ Eastman Kodak Co.
reported third-quarter earnings of $398 million, up 72 percent from
the same quarter last year. It was way ahead of schedule on its
cost-cutting campaign. It had stanched the peristent cash
hemmorhage from its digital portfolio. Yet investors reacted as
though they had been kicked in the stomach, and sent the
photography giant's shares plummeting. The reason: Kodak's earnings
may have been up, but its revenues declined. By Claudia H. Deutsch.
</P>
<P>
   HONDA-AD-COLUMN (Undated) _ Viewers of television shows like
``The Practice'' and ``Law and Order'' may be momentarily confused
next month when American Honda Motor Co. starts a $50 million
advertising campaign for its new Odyssey minivan. One of the ad's
scene-setting shots is intended to be mistaken for network
programming. By Andrea Adelson.

   BBN-BRAVES-PADRES (Atlanta) _ The Braves force a Game 6 in
Atlanta on Wednesday by rallying from the brink of elimination two
games in a row. The Braves will go with Glavine in Game 6, but what
will the Padres do? By Jason Diamos.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DINING (Moved in ``d'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MASHED-POTATOES (Undated) _ Comfort food _ that buzz phrase
embracing all the bland, soft satisfactions of childhood eating _
doesn't quite have the cachet now that it did a few years ago, when
restaurants everywhere were trying to outdo each other in the
evocation of home and hearth. But somehow, one of those
quintessentially comforting foods, mashed potatoes, has not only
held on in popularity but also managed to ease right into the
turbulent mainstream of today's creative cookery. By Florence
Fabricant.
</P>
<P>
   EATZI-MARKET (New York) _ It's not a restaurant. It's not a
grocery store. It's Eatzi's Market and Bakery, the food store that
ate Dallas. Now, in the boldest out-of-town incursion since George
Steinbrenner bought the Yankees, it has planted its cowboy boots
right in Macy's basement. As stunned shoppers in Dallas, Houston
and Atlanta already know, Eatzi's means high-energy and high-volume
(in both senses of the word). It's a prepared-food store in which
dozens of chefs, working in open kitchens, turn out hundreds of
dishes every day, with Puccini arias blasting away in the
background. By William Grimes.
</P>
<P>
   SEASONAL-FOOD (New York) _ It's autumn in New York. A chill is
nudging through the last trace of summer's warmth, and the leaves
hint of turning. The signs are impossible to miss _ except, maybe,
if you're a chef. After all the lip service New York's best cooks
have given to the virtues of seasonal cooking, some of them have
decided that they'll cook seasonally, all right, but they'll be the
ones to choose exactly which season. By Amanda Hesser.
</P>
<P>
   MASTIC-ICE-CREAM (New York) _ Of the eight Greek dessert choices
on the menu at Molyvos, the one ordered least is mastic ice cream
with Commandaria and fig sauce. Mastic ice cream? True, the dessert
suffers from a name-image problem: it's not exactly loaded with
lyricism. It's unfamiliar, too, except to those who know this rare
and costly flavoring; at $60 to more than $100 a pound, mastic
might be called the caviar of flavors. By Suzanne Hamlin.

``The Pirate King,'' is among the rigorously selected works at the

 &HT;    Yanks slug way into Series
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It ended much like the series started, the Yankees
flexing, showing why the word great is sometimes used to describe
them, and the Indians crumbling, proving again it's impossible to
overcome bad pitching.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a 9-5 win for Yankees Tuesday night, the Bombers
taking the American League pennant in six games and now having a
few days to sit back, relax and wait for their World Series
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The Fall Classic begins here Saturday night, and no matter who
comes to town, whether it be the Braves or Padres, the Yankees have
cleaned up their act and will be the favorite to take it all.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees celebrated their 35th AL title in a game that had
some very interesting moments, including a grand slam by Jim Thome
that for an inning had everyone thinking of the possibility of the
series going to a seventh game.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees led 6-0, as David Cone totally dominated the Indians
for the first four innings and Scott Brosius hit a three-run shot
in the third. But in the fifth, Cone got sloppy, walking in a run
with none out. One out later, Thome blasted a grand slam into the
upper deck in right field.
</P>
<P>
   But Cleveland couldn't keep it close, thanks partially to the
bullpen, an error by shortstop Omar Vizquel and right fielder Manny
Ramirez, who misjudged a ball that may haunt him forever. The
inning started with Vizquel's first ever postseason error in 47
games (237 chances). Then, with runners at first and second and one
out in the sixth, Derek Jeter drove a ball to right-center. Ramirez
thought it was going out and leapt at the wall. Meanwhile, the ball
dropped about 10 feet in front of him. It ended up being a triple,
the Yankees scoring twice. They would add another, get some solid
relief pitching and then danced along with their fans to Frank
Sinatra singing ``New York, New York.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a strange series. After blasting the Indians in the
opener and then losing two straight, the Yankees took three
straight. But it was not until Tuesday that their bats came alive,
against right-hander Charles Nagy, about the best the Indians have
to offer on this pitching-poor team. He was gone by the fourth. The
Yankees had been hitting .198 in the series, but on this night they
never stopped swinging the bats.
