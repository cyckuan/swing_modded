<HEADLINE> Mets 5, Brewers 4, 10 innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Melvin Mora hit his first major league home run,
connecting in the 10th inning Thursday night to give the New York
Mets a 5-4 win over the Milwaukee Brewers for a three-game sweep.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets won their fourth in a row, and beat the Brewers for the
eighth straight time.
</P>
<P>
   Mora, who emerged as a late-season hero for the Mets last year,
homered with one out. His drive over the center-field fence against
Curtis Leskanic (0-1) came in his 53rd at-bat in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Turk Wendell (1-0), the fourth Mets pitcher, pitched a hitless
10th for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza homered over the left-center field bleachers for the
Mets. Derek Bell hit a leadoff homer in the seventh that started a
three-run rally that tied it at 4, and also doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Hayes, cut by the Mets in spring training, had a home
run, double and single for the Brewers. James Mouton homered for
Milwaukee, and was later involved in a collision that caused
shortstop Mark Loretta to leave the game.
</P>
<P>
   Mouton ran in from left field and knocked into Loretta on Rickey
Henderson's foul fly in the sixth. Loretta caught the ball to end
the inning, and both players fell to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Mouton stayed in the game, but Loretta left and was diagnosed
with dizziness and slight disorientation. He was listed a
day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   Brewers starter Steve Woodard took a 4-1 lead into the seventh.
After Bell homered, Edgardo Alfonzo followed with a single and
Piazza walked on four pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Valerio de Los Santos retired Robin Ventura on a force play, and
David Weathers relieved. Todd Zeile hit an RBI single and when
right fielder Jeromy Burnitz's throw to third soared into the
stands, Ventura scored the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   Burnitz hit a sacrifice fly in the first off Al Leiter. Mouton
broke a 1-1 tie with his first homer of the season, a two-run shot
in the third on which he broke his bat off at the handle.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza hit his fourth home run, a long shot in the second.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Jim Bruske got the last out of the seventh. The reliever
has appeared in eight of Brewers' first 15 games. ... Jose
Hernandez singled off Leiter in the fourth and also struck out
twice. He is 2-for-20 in his career against the left-hander. ...
Dennis Cook relieved in the ninth and became the third Mets pitcher
to make 10 appearances this season, joining Armando Benitez and
Wendell.

<HEADLINE> Religion in the News  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER THORNE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GEORGETOWN, Del. (AP) -- Russell Epps takes in the knotty-pine
ceiling of the prison chapel and the other inmates on the padded
chairs listening to a Bible lecture.
</P>
<P>
   For him, this is home.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like a family in here for me, with the others and with
Christ. It's like a family relationship,'' said the 39-year-old
convicted burglar. Four years from the time he found his faith
behind bars, he is still three years from freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Epps leads the inmate choir at the Sussex Correctional
Institute, a compound of cinderblock buildings and razor wire in
southern Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   In this prison on Easter Sunday, a coalition of evangelists and
prison ministries -- including Chuck Colson, the Watergate
figure-turned-minister, and Franklin Graham, son of evangelist
Billy Graham -- will launch Operation Starting Line, an ambitious
campaign to establish Christian programs in 1,800 prisons holding 2
million inmates across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Colson, Graham and others will spend Easter praying and talking
with inmates like Epps. Meanwhile, motivational speakers and
singers will hold a revival on a stage to be erected in the
exercise yard.
</P>
<P>
   From here, the revival will go to other Delaware prisons and,
later this year, to state and federal prisons in Michigan, New
York, Missouri, Virginia and Florida. All 50 states will be reached
during the next five years, said Colson, who served seven months in
prison for Watergate-related crimes. After that, he founded Prison
Fellowship Ministries, a nonprofit company that offers Bible
studies and counseling and is a model for Operation Starting Line.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, Colson says: to prepare inmates for life outside
prison by preaching religion and counseling them about life and job
skills. A key part of the effort is a mentoring plan that puts
ex-convicts in touch with someone in a local church for guidance.
</P>
<P>
   The program will rely mostly on volunteers to remain after the
revival has moved on.
</P>
<P>
   ''The one thing I know from working 25 years in prisons,''
Colson said, ''is that rehabilitation programs don't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Operation Starting Line's ambitious effort will work is
another question.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Clear, who teaches at John Jay College of Criminal Justice
in New York City, studied 380 convicts released from 20 prisons
around the country. After interviewing them in 1990-91 and again in
1997-98, he found that religious faith made little difference in
whether an ex-convict ended up back in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a handful of studies out there, and they do not make
a strong case that religious programming makes the community safer
by saving souls,'' Clear said. But he said religion still has
significance in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an important part of what needs to be available to men
and women who are locked up,'' he said. ''Prison is an assault on
identity, but religion can help people retain their identity. But
it can't be oversold, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Colson said prison is dehumanizing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw people whose lives were without value,'' he said, ''and
I got them into Bible studies and saw how the Gospel changed
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Epps grew up with an alcoholic mother and a drug-addicted
father. His grandmother took him to church every Sunday, but he
says he didn't understand what church had to offer. ''To me it was
a ritual, something I was obligated to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When he entered prison in 1996, Epps said he was approached by
another inmate who had been ''saved.'' Epps thought about his life,
about how close he had come to being killed or killing someone. He
embraced Christianity and believes it will help him stay out of
prison when he leaves.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got something now that will help me overcome that
temptation to do wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are inmates who had religion before they were convicted,
men like Reginald Clark, serving a 31-month sentence for violating
his probation for assault and other convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, 37, found God during his first prison stint. After he was
released, he says, he walked away from the tenets of Christianity --
notably leading a life free of drugs, alcohol abuse and loose sex.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know from my own experience how hard it is to give these
things up, but they mean nothing but trouble,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   ''And I see the other brothers trying to make the choice,'' he
said. ''They want to be saved, but then they sit back and think
about it because it means they have to give up their girlfriend
because they're not married, drugs, alcohol. And they are thinking,
'What will my friends say?'''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Colson said, there are those who will leave prison with
a new or renewed faith only to break the law again.
</P>
<P>
   ''People who are Christians aren't perfect,'' he said.
''Christians sin like everybody else But hopefully, if you're
serious with your faith, you won't be getting in trouble as much.''

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 3, Rockies 0  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Off to one of the best starts of his career,
Randy Johnson threw his second shutout and third complete game in
four starts as the Arizona Diamondbacks beat the Colorado Rockies
3-0 on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson (4-0) allowed four hits, struck out eight, walked three
and even drove in a run with a single in the sixth inning. The
Diamondbacks' other two runs came on a passed ball by catcher Ben
Petrick and a wild pitch by Brian Bohanon.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is just one out short of having a complete game in all
four starts. In 35 2-3 innings this season, he has struck out 42,
walked five and allowed three earned runs.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old left-hander pitched to 102 batters without a
walk before Larry Walker drew a base on balls with one out in the
fourth inning. Johnson had 39 strikeouts during that 29-inning
span.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado starter Rolando Arrojo (1-2) left the game in the
second inning with runners on first and second and no outs. He
strained his left hamstring in the first inning, then bruised his
left calf when he was hit by Travis Lee's line drive to lead off
the second. He left after he couldn't come up with Damian Miller's
soft grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's control finally faltered in the eighth, when he gave
up a single to Neifi Perez, then walked pinch-hitter Jeff Manto and
Brian Hunter to load the bases with two outs. Then, on a 3-2 pitch
with the crowd chanting ''Randy, Randy,'' Johnson caught Lansing
looking for a strikeout to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, which won three out of four from the Rockies, scored an
unearned run off Arrojo in the first when Jay Bell and Luis
Gonzalez walked with one out. They advanced on Erubiel Durazo's
ground out, then Bell scored on a passed ball.
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon, who lost his job in the rotation after three horrible
starts, didn't allow a run until he walked Steve Finley and Lee to
start the sixth. The runners moved up on Miller's fly out to right,
then Andy Fox was walked intentionally to load the bases for
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon's wild pitch to Johnson allowed Finley to score, then
Johnson singled up the middle. Lee scored, but Fox was thrown out
at the plate by the center fielder Hunter.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Diamondbacks will activate closer Matt Mantei on
Friday. He's been on the disabled list since April 2 with biceps
tendinitis. ... Walker asked to be in the lineup because he's never
started in three opportunities against Johnson and was livid over a
Denver columnist's suggestion that he was afraid to face the big
lefty. Walker was 0-for-3 with the walk. ... Until Todd Helton's
one-out double in the second, left-handed batters were 0-for-13
against Johnson this season. ... For the second time in two starts,
Johnson had a three-pitch inning, this time in the fifth. He said
he's never had one before in his career.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Ruling Hurts Ousted Leader  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- The High Court ruled Friday that
Malaysia's prime minister is not required to testify in the sex
trial of an ousted deputy premier, deflating defense hopes of
proving the charges are politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is not an iota of evidence to show that Dr. Mahathir
Mohamad is involved in a political conspiracy to fabricate evidence
of sodomy to topple Anwar Ibrahim,'' Judge Ariffin Jaka said.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar jumped up, shook his fist at the judge and then pounded it
on the wooden guard rail. ''Where is justice in this court?'' he
shouted. ''You should not allow him to hide behind his executive
privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge's decision ended six months of legal wrangling over a
defense subpoena for the prime minister to answer questions
regarding an alleged political conspiracy to frame Anwar.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar was fired by Mahathir in September 1998, arrested and
charged with corruption. A High Court judge convicted him in April
last year and sentenced him to six years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-deputy prime minister is now on trial on charges of
sodomy, a crime in predominantly Muslim Malaysia, and faces another
20 years imprisonment if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar has maintained throughout that Mahathir and other
government leaders framed him in both cases to quash his chances of
becoming prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Mahathir's presence in court was not relevant
to Anwar's trial on the charge of sodomizing his former driver
Azizan Abu Bakar.
</P>
<P>
   Chief prosecutor Abdul Gani Patail told the court this week that
it was merely a stunt by Anwar's lawyers to ridicule the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   With the issue of Mahathir's testimony resolved, the trial could
now end soon because the defense team has few witnesses left to
call.

<HEADLINE> Chapman Christian Music Awards  </HEADLINE>
By JIM PATTERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Longtime Dove Awards favorite Steven
Curtis Chapman dominated again on Thursday, winning six awards for
Christian music including the top honor of best artist.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman, 37, has won 44 Dove Awards, more than any other
performer. He has won for best artist five previous times.
</P>
<P>
   He brought his wife and three children on stage to share the
best artist award, and introduced a new fourth child -- 7-month-old
daughter Shaohannah Hope, whom he recently adopted in China.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to dedicate this tonight to the little boys and girls
around the world who don't have a mom and dad to teach them how to
live the life they've been given,'' Chapman said. ''We wanted to
come out tonight and celebrate Shaohannah, and celebrate
adoption.''
</P>
<P>
   Chapman also won best male vocalist, best pop-contemporary album
for ''Speechless'' and best pop-contemporary single for ''Dive.''
He won two awards apiece in the single and album categories,
because he produced as well as performed on them.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's best artist Michael W. Smith won best song for
''This is Your Time,'' a song inspired by the Columbine High School
shootings. He performed it during the awards show, which took place
exactly a year after the tragedy in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis Rams quarterback Kurt Warner presented the best song
award to Smith along with Tennessee Titans coach Jeff Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I'll let you handle this trophy. I got the last one,''
Warner said to Fisher, referring to the Rams victory over the
Titans in this year's Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In other major categories, Sixpence None the Richer was named
best group, Jaci Velasquez won her second straight best female
vocalist award, and Ginny Owens won best new artist.
</P>
<P>
   ''What a strange thing it is to be rewarded for a gift that only
God could have given,'' Owens said.
</P>
<P>
   Country star Glen Campbell was awarded best country album for
''A Glen Campbell Christmas.'' George Jones won a Dove for best
country recorded song for ''Angel Band,'' his duet with Vestal
Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   Kathie Lee Gifford, the awards show's hostess, performed a duet
with Dolly Parton, ''Only My Pillow Knows,'' and said she hoped the
show would ''remind people of the incredible diversity that make up
gospel music in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ''The message hasn't changed, but the music certainly has,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Awards were passed out in 43 categories at the Grand Ole Opry
House, seven during the television show scheduled to air in more
than 100 markets over the next week. Dove Award winners are
nominated and selected by 5,500 members of the Gospel Music
Association, which was founded in 1964 to promote Christian music.

<HEADLINE> Filipinos Celebrate Good Friday  </HEADLINE>
By GLADYS NEBAB, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN PEDRO CUTUD, Philippines (AP) -- Thousands of tourists
flocked here Friday to watch a bizarre highlight of Easter week
celebrations in Asia's largest Catholic nation -- the nailing of
penitents to crosses in a re-enactment of Jesus' death.
</P>
<P>
   At least nine Filipinos, including a woman, were expected to be
''crucified'' on three crosses on a small hill outside San Pedro
Cutud, a farming village north of Manila.
</P>
<P>
   Most stay on the crosses under a hot sun for only a few minutes
in the ritual that has continued for more than 40 years. The
faithful believe it is a form of penance that helps prayers get
answered.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Philippines, thousands of bloody penitents,
including children, observed Good Friday by walking barefoot
through dusty village streets beating their bare backs with ropes
and pieces of wood, splashing spectators with blood.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that the ritual is sufficiently bloody, attendants use
pieces of broken glass to periodically open new cuts on the
penitents' backs.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church officially frowns on the rituals, but does
not attempt to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   Filipinos traditionally observe Lent with fasting and acts of
repentance. In Manila, many battled traffic and crowded sanctuaries
late Thursday night in a quest to visit 14 churches representing
the 14 stations of the cross.
</P>
<P>
   In Zamboanga in the southern Philippines, however, churches were
less crowded than usual because of fears of possible bomb attacks.
Scores of people have been killed by recent explosions blamed on
Muslim rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Police and soldiers guarded many churches and streets.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Cops Sentenced in Alcohol Killing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Six former Mexico City policemen convicted of
robbing and killing an American student have been sentenced to
between 68 and 99 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick McPhail, 27, of New York City, was found in his parked
car in Mexico City in November 1998. He had died of alcohol
poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   The police officers formed a group that has been accused of
regularly committing crimes against unsuspecting motorists.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the uniformed officers stopped drivers, then
allowed their civilian accomplices to rob them of their money and
credit cards. The assailants then forced the victims to drink a
bottle of alcohol so that they would get drunk and be unable to
identify the attackers, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Leon Gonzalez was sentenced to 85 years in prison on
Wednesday and Lucio Tapia Galindo to 99 years, the Mexico attorney
general's office said. The two were active police officers at the
time of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Their four accomplices had retired from the force when McPhail
died. Three received sentences of 79 years, while a fourth received
68 years, the attorney general's office said.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants were sentenced after being convicted of murder,
robbery, kidnapping, and organized crime. The judge gave the
defendants the long sentences to ensure they are not released on
probation. However, under the Federal District's penal code, a
person can't serve more than 50 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   McPhail was living in Mexico and studying at the Ibero-American
University, the attorney general's office said.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the suspects were arrested and extradited from Texas
last year.

<HEADLINE> Bristol-Myers May Be Merger Target  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- With the future of its promising blood-pressure
drug now uncertain, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. may find itself an
acquisition target or a merger player, some analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers' hopes of launching the next pill destined for
multibillion dollar annual sales were scuttled when federal
officials raised concerns that the experimental hypertension drug
Vanlev may cause severe facial swelling and impair breathing in
some patients.
</P>
<P>
   Those worries led the nation's third-largest drugmaker Wednesday
to withdraw its application for Vanlev until more studies can be
completed, a move that should delay launch of the pill until at
least late next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''A year delay on a potential blockbuster could cause them to
think more actively about merging,'' said Bob Kirby, an analyst
with Edward Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The company is downplaying the need to merge, despite the
consolidation wave sweeping the pharmaceutical industry. But the
officials aren't ruling it out.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not looking back or standing still,'' Michael Mee,
Bristol-Myers' chief financial officer, said in a conference call
Thursday with analysts. ''We are looking at all of our options with
great intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the company's first-quarter earnings rose a
better-than-expected 15 percent, most analysts' focus was clearly
on the company's pipeline of future products -- and the future of
Vanlev.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe a merger is likely if the company cannot
revive Vanlev, a drug expected to post $2 billion or more in annual
sales when it reaches market.
</P>
<P>
   ''They will probably merge if they are not able to revive
Vanlev,'' said Hemant Shah, an analyst with HKS &AMP; Co. He gives the
drug a 50-50 chance of making it on the market without serious
safety warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Companies routinely stumble in developing new drugs -- nine out
of 10 drugs they test in people never make it to market.
</P>
<P>
   But drug firms' pipelines have grown in importance as Wall
Street pressures the firms to show evidence they can continue to
raise profits at double-digit levels. As a result, the New
York-based Bristol-Myers has not shied away from promoting numerous
studies of Vanlev over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers officials acknowledge they expected to have the
drug approved in June, and had no contingency plan for the delay
caused after the Food and Drug Administration raised concerns.
</P>
<P>
   With a market capitalization of more than $100 billion and a
diverse portfolio of products, including medical devices and the
world's leading infant formula, Bristol-Myers remains confident
about the future.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very fortunate that we are not just a one- or two- or
three-product company,'' Mee said.
</P>
<P>
   Other big drugmakers have overcome similar research setbacks,
Kirby said. Merck &AMP; Co. in 1998 disappointed Wall Street when it
announced it was not moving ahead with a promising antidepressant.
And Schering-Plough Corp. was punished last year after the company
ran into safety problems with its experimental impotence pill.
</P>
<P>
   Until this week, Wall Street considered Bristol-Myers one of the
most attractive drugmakers. But the Vanlev problem spotlights a
number of potential shortcomings at the company.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of the company's top-selling drug, the
cholesterol-lowering pill Pravachol, have declined, losing market
share to Warner-Lambert Co.'s Lipitor. And the company's top cancer
drug Taxol is expected to lose patent protection in the next year
or two, making it vulnerable to cheaper generics.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a New England Journal of Medicine study raised
concerns about another Bristol-Myers' drug. It said Plavix, a new
blood thinner given to heart patients after angioplasty, in rare
cases may trigger a deadly blood disease.
</P>
<P>
   Plavix, which had $201 million in sales in the first quarter, up
128 percent from a year ago, is Bristol-Myers' fastest selling
drug.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers said the side effect was extremely rare and the
study would not have a big impact on sales.
</P>
<P>
   On a positive note, the company said it was resubmitting its new
colorectal cancer drug for FDA approval. Safety questions has been
raised after the drug was first submitted last year.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers reported earned $1.22 billion, or 61 cents per
diluted share, on revenue of $5.26 billion, up from $1.07 billion,
or 53 cents per share, on revenue of $4.85 billion last year.
Results beat analysts' forecasts by a penny, according to First
Call/Thomson Financial.

<HEADLINE> The Harsh Reality of Margin Debt  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CUNNIFF, AP Business Analyst
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- How many small investors might have been saved
the costly consequences of their naivete had the Federal Reserve
made it more difficult for them to invest?
</P>
<P>
   This is not a new question; it is old as the Great Depression of
the 1930s, but it has assumed a new meaning after the
multibillion-dollar shearing investors took during the cruelest
April in many years.
</P>
<P>
   It still has no answer, or at least no response that might put
the question to rest. The Fed had the power to limit what it viewed
as overly ebullient stock purchases, but it declined to use it.
</P>
<P>
   That power, expressed in so-called Regulation T, allows the Fed
to raise or lower margin requirements, or the size of the down
payment investors must produce before buying shares in a company.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has leftthe margin requirement at 50 percent since
January 1974, despite its acknowledgment that the rise in borrowing
to buy stocks over the past six months was worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   After rising in tandem with stock prices through much of the
1990s, such borrowing spurted late last year and during 2000, just
as the market itself spurted.
</P>
<P>
   As 1999 ended, investors owed New York Stock Exchange firms $229
billion, almost $50 billion more than in June, and the total was
rising. The Financial Markets Center, a think tank, measured the
tab as the highest in 63 years as a percentage of gross
domesticproduct.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind raising Regulation T is that higher down
payments, or margin requirements, would tend to discourage
speculation, and it had been used often for that purpose until
1974.
</P>
<P>
   While the idea might appear to be entirely rational, Fed
chairman Alan Greenspan testified before Congress that a rising
level of stock prices is unrelated to liberal margin requirements.
</P>
<P>
   He went further, cautioning that to raise requirements might put
small and poor investors at a disadvantage to large investors, who
have various other sources of funds to help meet down payments.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Fed raised interest rates in an attempt to slow
the economy, which it feared was being pushed by demands beyond its
ability to produce, a well-known precursor of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market all put ignored the higher rates. Investors
continued to pour money into the market, and many of them then
doubled the size of their investment by borrowing from their
broker. In effect, they used stock as collateral to borrow half the
price.
</P>
<P>
   As almost any investor could recognize, the danger in such a
procedure was that a downturn in the market value of their stocks --
the collateral -- would require them to put up more money. Either
that, or face the possibility the broker might sell their stocks.
</P>
<P>
   It was a danger easily ignored as the market continued to soar.
Optimists at heart, many investors rationalized that they would be
able to sell out well before prices ever fell to margin-call
levels.
</P>
<P>
   They and others now know that a modern market of huge
institutional traders and instant electronics can turn a gain into
a loss within minutes, leaving individual traders no time to sell.
</P>
<P>
   The question of why margins weren't raised isn't just for the
Federal Reserve. Brokers, too, could have imposed their own margin
levels; some did so, but many did not. And the situation is also
one to be pondered by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, and unavoidably, the consequences of borrowing to buy
stocks is one that must be considered by every investor.
</P>
<P>
   They can wonder and complain, perhaps justifiably, why they
weren't better protected -- from themselves -- no less. But in a free
and open market they are where the buck stops.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Economy Expected To Recover  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's economic planning chief said Friday that
the economy is expected to achieve a ''considerable'' recovery
later this year, but that government stimulus is still necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ''The economy's wheels have finally left the runway,'' Economic
Planning Agency chief Taiichi Sakaiya told a regular news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the economy continues on this flight path, I expect it will
be in a pretty good condition in the second half of the (fiscal)
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Sakaiya warned, however, that the economy still needs
stimulative government policies to keep it on track for sustainable
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's economy slipped back into recession late last year after
a period of fitful growth. But rising industrial productivity and
corporate restructuring drives have raised hope that Japan's
decade-long economic slump may be ending.
</P>
<P>
   Sakaiya said he feels consumer spending, one of weakest areas of
the economy, will revive next year as there are signs that wages
are improving in some areas.

<HEADLINE> Indians 9, Athletics 5  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Kenny Lofton and Jim Thome homered in the first
and Dave Burba pitched five innings before the rain came Thursday
night as the Cleveland Indians avoided a sweep with a 9-5 win over
the Oakland Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton's leadoff homer, Thome's two-run shot off Tim Hudson
(1-2) and Manny Ramirez's two-run homer in the seventh enabled the
Indians to salvage the series finale and conclude a season-opening
homestand at 2-4.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Alomar went 3-for-4 -- he also hit a line drive off
Hudson's chest that forced him to leave -- as Cleveland finally
broke out of a team-wide hitting slump at Jacobs Field. The Indians
batted just .215 in their first five home games.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians will begin a three-game series in Boston on Friday,
their first meeting with the Red Sox since blowing a 2-0 lead in
the AL playoffs last October. Pedro Martinez will pitch the opener
for the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland's John Jaha tied a major league record by striking out
five times in a nine-inning game. Jaha is the 38th player in
history to match the dubious feat and first since Thome, who struck
out five times against Tampa Bay on April 9.
</P>
<P>
   Burba (2-1) bounced back from a rough start against Texas by
striking out nine. He didn't return after the game was delayed for
1 hour, 42 minutes in the top of the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The A's loaded the bases with two outs in the sixth off Scott
Kamieniecki, who grabbed Ryan Christenson's hard liner to end the
inning and slammed the ball off the mound in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   He was pounding his glove an inning later when Matt Stairs hit a
two-run homer to bring Oakland within 6-4. But Ricardo Rincon came
in with a runner on and struck out Ben Grieve and Eric Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez hit his fifth homer in the seventh off T.J. Mathews and
Jacob Cruz added an RBI to put Cleveland ahead 9-4.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson left in the third inning with a bruised chest after being
struck by Alomar's liner.
</P>
<P>
   With one out and a runner on first, Alomar sent a drive that
nailed Hudson as the right-hander was making his follow-through.
Hudson grabbed his chest and squatted down behind the mound in pain
as the ball rolled into right field and Alomar reached first.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson was replaced by Ron Mahay, who gave up an RBI groundout
to Ramirez as the Indians opened a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Oakland has had five players strike out five times in a
game. Jose Canseco was the last A's player to do so on July 16,
1997, against Kansas City. ... A's hitters have 101 strikeouts in
their last 10 games. ... Alomar made his third error in five games.
He had a 65-game errorless streak last season and made just three
errors in his last 92 games. ... Lofton has homered leading off a
game 17 times during the regular season in his career and once in
the postseason. ... Bobby Witt will make his first start for the
Indians on Friday night in Boston against Martinez. Witt, who
unexpectedly made Cleveland's staff after being invited to spring
training as a non-roster player, is 12-5 in his career against the
Red Sox.

   HAVANA (AP) -- Venting anger at a U.N. human rights censure and at delays in
the return of Elian Gonzalez, About 100,000 chanting, flag-waving government
supporters massed Thursday in front of the U.S. mission. The enormous crowd,

   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- The High Court ruled Friday that Malaysia's
prime minister is not required to testify in the sex trial of an ousted deputy
premier, deflating defense hopes of proving the charges are politically
motivated. Anwar jumped up, shook his fist at the judge and then pounded it on
the wooden guard rail. ''Where is justice in this court?'' he shouted. ''You
should not allow him to hide behind his executive privilege.'' The judge's
decision ended six months of legal wrangling over a defense subpoena for the
prime minister to answer questions regarding an alleged political conspiracy to
frame Anwar.

   LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- In memory of the school shooting massacre,
Coloradans fell silent while a church bell tolled 13 times at 11:21 a.m.
Thursday, the precise moment two teen-agers opened fire in Columbine High School
on April 20, 1999. At private ceremonies and public remembrances all day and
into the night today, students, staff, survivors and strangers came together to
mark the first anniversary of the nation's deadliest school shooting. Gov. Bill

documents and witnesses, South Korean soldiers and police, observed at times by
U.S. Army officers, executed more than 2,000 political prisoners without trial
in the early weeks of the Korean War. Supreme commander Gen. Douglas MacArthur
became aware of at least one of the mass shootings, according to documents
originally classified ''top secret.'' The new information, detailed in reporting
by The Associated Press and a Korean researcher, substantiates what some
historians have long believed: Large numbers of South Korean leftists arrested
by the right-wing regime were secretly killed.

Spokane County Sheriff Mark Sterk said samples of DNA taken from Robert Lee
Yates Jr. matched DNA found on the bodies of at least eight prostitutes. Other
physical evidence links him to the murders of four other women, the sheriff
said. All of the victims were shot to death, and their bodies dumped in remote
locations. Yates, 47, has been charged in only one death. Additional charges are

<HEADLINE> Rocker Blasts Media in TV Interview  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- After picking up his first save since serving a
two-week suspension, John Rocker once again refused to talk with
reporters in the Atlanta Braves clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   He blasted the media, however, during an interview with Fox
Sports Net on his way off the field Thursday night, accusing
reporters of going too far in their zeal to report on his
insensitive comments about immigrants, gays and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's been a lot of instances over the last three or four
months when the media has been completely oblivious of my privacy
and my family's privacy,'' Rocker told Fox Sports Net. ''They've
overstepped their bounds in a lot of areas. It's time for a little
payback.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker returned from his suspension Tuesday night and pitched a
scoreless inning against the Philadelphia Phillies. Afterwards, he
reacted angrily when he arrived at his locker to find it surrounded
by reporters and cameramen.
</P>
<P>
   ''Beat it, media,'' he said. ''I'm not talking.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker didn't pitch Wednesday but was standing at his locker
when reporters entered the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone want an interview? Nope? Missed your chance,'' he said
facetiously, hurrying off to the showers.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker was asked to explain his actions by Fox Sports Net.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're not going to be able to treat me the way they've
treated me and get me to jump at their every whim and do every
little interview they want me to do,'' he said. ''There were news
trucks sitting outside my house at 1 in the morning on Christmas
Eve. I don't think I deserve that kind of treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker has received standing ovations in both games he pitched
at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fans here in Atlanta have been terrific. I can't ask for
anything more from the fans of Atlanta,'' he said. ''My teammates
have been wonderful. They know me really well.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker said the controversy over his statements in a December
issue of Sports Illustrated ''will end when the media decides it's
going to end it. Until something else comes up that gives you guys
something to talk about, you'll keep beating a dead horse.''
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old left-hander saved 38 games for the NL champions
a year ago, one short of the franchise record. His value to the
team was demonstrated during his absence, when the bullpen went 1-4
with a 5.14 ERA and two blown saves.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker has pitched two scoreless innings since coming back,
striking out the final two Philadelphia hitters Thursday night to
earn his first save since the 1999 NL championship series.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just hope to repeat the things I did last year,'' Rocker
said. ''The name of the game is consistency. A lot of guys have one
big year and they're a flash in the pan. The league catches up with
them and they don't make adjustments. They fizzle out. I'm hoping
to be consistent. I want to put up 35 or 40 saves like I did last
year and give this team a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we get to the playoffs and I perform like that, I'll be
satisfied.''

<HEADLINE> Former Driver Faces More Jail Time  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEBANON, Ohio (AP) -- Former race car driver David ''Salt''
Walther is being held without bond pending trial on charges of
child endangering and violating his probation in a 1998 drug case.
</P>
<P>
   Walther, 52, of Middletown, Ohio, is accused of being under the
influence of drugs on March 19 when he returned his 4-year-old
daughter to her mother in Springboro, according to court documents.
His probation officer also accused Walther of missing two
appointments and testing positive for cocaine after his arrest on
March 24.
</P>
<P>
   Walther, who raced in the Indianapolis 500 seven times, was
convicted in August 1998 of taking drugs into a detention facility.
He was caught carrying three prescription painkillers into the
county jail stuffed into the fingers of a glove he wears over a
hand injured in a fiery 1973 crash at Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Walther was returning to the jail from work release in 1998 when
he was arrested on the felony drug charge. He was serving a 100-day
jail sentence for failing to pay $359 a month in child support.

<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDORA, Calif. (AP) -- California Day-Fresh Foods has pulled
orange and grapefruit juice, lemonade and other drinks from store
shelves in six states because of possible salmonella contamination.
</P>
<P>
   The voluntary recall was taken as a precaution after some people
came down with salmonella in Southern California, Nevada and
Colorado after drinking the products, company spokeswoman Judy
Lynes said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen cases have been reported, said Ruth Welch of the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point, no salmonella has been found in any of the
product,'' but testing continues, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms of salmonella include fever, severe headache, vomiting,
abdominal pain and diarrhea. Young children, the elderly and people
with weakened immune systems are particularly susceptible to
infection.
</P>
<P>
   The recalled products were sold in Arizona, California,
Colorado, Nevada, Oregon and Washington state. They have ''best if
used by'' dates on or before May 4, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The drinks include Naked brand orange and grapefruit juice,
lemonade, strawberry lemonade, old-fashioned lemonade and
''Tangerine Scream.'' Also Ferraro's orange juice, Von's orange and
grapefruit juices and Trader Joe's blood orange juice.

<HEADLINE> Govt: Overweight Need More Exercise  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID PITT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- More than half of the Americans who say they're
overweight are trying to slim down, but the government says they're
not exercising enough.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 national survey by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention found that 53.8 percent of American adults reported
being overweight and that half of them were trying to lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those trying to become more trim -- 62.7 percent -- were
exercising, but only 28 percent said they worked out 30 minutes a
day at least five days a week, the minimum government
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The good news is that many people are using physical activity
and we want to encourage that but promote doing it more
frequently,'' said Mary Ellen Simpson, a spokeswoman for the
National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health
Promotion.
</P>
<P>
   The average overweight person trying to lose weight exercised
three days a week -- generally by walking.
</P>
<P>
   The obese, elderly and least educated work out less often,
pointing to the need for public health agencies to educate these
groups, the CDC concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC considers anyone up to 30 pounds over the target weight
for their body size to be overweight. Anyone above 30 pounds over
target weight is considered obese. The study reported Thursday
looked only at overweight people.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that overweight adults in Southern states
are least likely to exercise, while those in the Midwest are the
most active.
</P>
<P>
   Among the adults trying to take off pounds, 66.6 percent of men
and 62.2 percent of women said they exercised.
</P>
<P>
   Among men with a college degree, 72.7 percent said they
exercise, while only 47.4 percent of those without a high school
education exercise. Among college-educated women, 71.9 percent said
they exercise, while 44.6 percent of women without a high school
diploma do.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson speculated that highly educated people are more likely
to belong to health clubs or play social sports such as golf.

<HEADLINE> On the Front Line in Little Havana  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN CLENDENNING, and
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The day begins with stretches and a regimen of
sit-ups, push-ups and sprints for Bienvenido Comas.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old convention coordinator and seven friends follow
it up by practicing a little civil disobedience, forming a ''human
chain'' at the Little Havana home of Elian Gonzalez's Florida
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Even at this hour -- 5:20 a.m. -- there are stalwarts watching
over Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Comas is a regular, often here all night. Over the past few
months, he has talked of pro-Castro spies, of desperate measures,
of another Waco. And people listen.
</P>
<P>
   Their fear of a government attempt to take the 6-year-old boy
away from his great-uncle's home is unshakable and is now
well-known across the United States and across the Florida Straits,
in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Though their numbers dip to a hardy dozen or so overnight, the
fervor remains the same, from the sign-waving chanting mobs to the
quiet neighbors watching from their porch steps to those in the
lawn chairs, sipping cup after cup of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes after Comas finishes exercising, police tell a
group of men to remove the shirts they have wrapped around their
faces. Masks are illegal in public in Florida, except on Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   Miriam Duboy arrives as the sun peeks over the horizon. She is
among a group of women dressed in black who gather every morning in
a prayer circle.
</P>
<P>
   Duboy is attending for the second time. The 55-year-old
interpreter from Fort Lee, N.J., has an apartment on Miami Beach.
She hopes Elian doesn't suffer if he is returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Their prayers are drowned out by the overhead buzz of a
television news helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   As the lunch hour approaches and Miami's hot sun sends the
temperature rising to 85 degrees, protesters chip in to buy water,
cups, ice and snacks.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Though passions have run high, there have been only a handful of
arrests at the Little Havana home. Once, when protesters pushed
through the metal barricades, police just watched them go.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesman Delrish Moss sees it this way: ''If you're
going to protest, if you're going to have an issue, this has
certainly been the model of acting well, acting responsibly, in the
midst of those passions.''
</P>
<P>
   Andre Montoto is carrying a picture of Bill Clinton with an
elongated nose, a la Pinocchio. Although he is only five years
older than Elian, Andre has an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point,'' says Andre, ''the only miracle that could
happen is that his father says he wants to stay here, but for now I
don't think that he's going to stay. I think that he should have
more heart for his son.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd swells -- people have finished work and dinner -- and
then begins the round of nightly news live shots. The crowds begin
their chants of ''Elian No Se Va'' and ''Libertad.''
</P>
<P>
   In a lawn chair, 30 feet away, sits Jorge Rosettiz, a large
Cuban flag in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   The 56-year-old bricklayer works for his son, but hasn't so much
as mixed mortar for two weeks, attending the protests on a daily
basis. He lives three blocks away from the demonstration scene.
</P>
<P>
   American-born with a Cuban father, he grew up in Brooklyn and
moved to Miami when he was 19.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until it's over, I won't do any work,'' he says. ''I'm
draining all my money and I'm beginning to worry. Life is
expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   His son has other worries. ''He's afraid I'm going to get into
trouble,'' Rosettiz says.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   It's just turned dark and Gloria Santos, a 48-year-old Honduran
maid, is walking around the masses for the first time. Her sign
reads: ''Reno How Much Is Castro Paying You?''
</P>
<P>
   ''These people are seeking justice,'' she says as smoke from
roasting pork wafts through the streets. ''These people want to
give the child what he deserves: Liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no family news conferences this night. The crowd grows
until the late news, then quickly dwindles. By 2:15 a.m., a stiff
wind is blowing and many of the 50 or so people still on the scene
huddle in sweaters and blankets. This late, with friends and
neighbors asleep, the only bathroom option is four portable toilets
at the end of the street.
</P>
<P>
   Fred de la Torre, a 50-year-old limousine driver, just got off
of work, and arrives with a fat cigar in hand and four large cups
of strong Cuban coffee from a nearby restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cafe? Cafe?'' he asks. ''Anyone else? Here's a little glass.''
</P>
<P>
   De la Torre came over from Cuba in 1959 with his father and
still has many relatives there, including his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ''The main reason for this,'' he says, waving his hand at his
fellow campers, ''is to show the plight of the Cuban people.''
</P>
<P>
   He translates for Gabriel Hernandez, 54, who came over in the
1980 Mariel boatlift, leaving two children behind. He's tried to go
back, but his passport has a stamp that says ''No Return.'' He says
he has no interest in becoming a U.S. citizen.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because I'm Cuban,'' Hernandez says with pride. ''I came here
with the idea of returning.''
</P>
<P>
   It's 4:30 a.m. and there are 25 people left. Maria Elena
Queseda, 54, sits with four other women in lawn chairs, sipping
coffee and talking quietly about how they have put more faith in
God as the saga grinds on.
</P>
<P>
   She's been on the graveyard shift for two weeks now.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even if we don't stop the federal government, we're a
deterrent, especially because we're women,'' she says. ''It'll be
ugly on television if it's women and children if there's violence
on their part.''
</P>
<P>
   It's now close to 5 a.m., and a group of 10 people start a cheer
of, 'Elian, Elian.'
</P>
<P>
   It lasts for about 30 seconds -- the first chant of a new day.

<HEADLINE> Demand May Rise for Type of Canola  </HEADLINE>
By BRIAN WITTE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- Demand could rise for a type of canola
with less fatty acid if the government approves new labeling
requirements, a North Dakota canola group says.
</P>
<P>
   Dow AgroSciences, based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and Cargill of
Minnetonka, Minn., are the first two companies to work with a
variety of lowfat canola called Low Lin.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of Low Lin is that less trans fatty acids are
created when it is changed from a solid to a liquid, said Barry
Coleman, executive director of the Northern Canola Growers
Association. Some health experts believe trans fatty acid
contributes to heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration is considering regulations that
would require companies to show in labeling how much trans fatty
acid is in a product.
</P>
<P>
   ''As demand for healthy oil alternatives increases, so will the
number of growers raising Low Lin canola and the number of
processors and wholesalers bottling it,'' said Tom Borgen,
president of the growers association.
</P>
<P>
   Canola has the lowest level of saturated fat than any edible
oil. Most Low Lin canola is used in the cooking and frying and in
the snack food industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''You'll see a lot of competing oils working to modify their
fatty acid profile,'' Coleman said. ''And canola is probably out in
front of all the competing oils as far as making progress'' in
reducing fatty acid.
</P>
<P>
   North Dakota is the nation's leading producer of canola. The
U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that a record 1.2 million
acres will be planted this year. The department estimated that 1.5
million acres will be planted nationally.
</P>
<P>
   More North Dakota farmers are starting to try Low Lin, but most
are beginning with a small amount, Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   Dow AgroSciences has teamed up with Winnipeg-based James
Richardson International grain company to grow a specific variety
of Low Lin canola. JRI contracts most of its production in Canada,
but the company started contracting acres in North Dakota about two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''As more growers see production results by neighboring farmers
and research centers, I expect the acreage to increase,'' said
David Mack, a JRI representative in North Dakota.
</P>

   LITTLE ROCK (AP) -- The Arkansas state legislature may soon
consider creating a state Department of Agriculture or similar
centralized organization that would help farmers in the state get
the most out of their land.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Jan Judy, a Democrat from Fayetteville, offered the
proposal Thursday in a presentation before the state House and
Senate interim committees on agriculture and economic development.
</P>
<P>
   ''My hope is that in the next session, we will be able to create
a Department of Agriculture or similar organization,'' Judy said.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas and Rhode Island are the only two states without a
Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Such a department would give farmers a place to receive
information concerning their products and the markets, both
domestic or international, supporters of the proposal said.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Ford grows blueberries and blackberries but says there is no
one to help new farmers get started. Instead, the state has ''a
collection of independent agencies'' that have no efficient way of
communicating, Ford said.

<HEADLINE> Kids Wanting Asylum Face Hurdles  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez signed his asylum application
himself but legal experts say that doesn't necessarily mean he is
mature enough to pursue the case against his father's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never even heard of a 6-year-old pressing an asylum claim
before,'' says District of Columbia lawyer Michael Maggio, who has
been practicing immigration law for 22 years. ''This case is a
parent's nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   A child Elian's age ''doesn't really have the life experience
and maturity ... to understand enough about which political system
he professes allegiance to,'' added Bernard Perlmutter, director of
the University of Miami's Children and Youth Law Clinic. ''The fact
that Elian signed this application does not at all convince me that
he knew what he was signing.''
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court Wednesday barred Elian's return to Cuba
until it determines whether he must be given a hearing to seek
asylum. Miami relatives want to keep the boy in this country but
his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, wants to take him home to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was found clinging to an inner tube off the Florida
coast last Thanksgiving. His mother and other Cubans drowned when
their boat capsized while trying to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Children ordinarily do not seek asylum against a parent's
wishes. But the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Elian may
be entitled to seek asylum on his own, and chided U.S. immigration
officials for failing to interview him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not only does it appear that (Elian) might be entitled to
apply personally for asylum, it appears that he did so'' by signing
an asylum application, the appeals court said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law says ''any alien'' in the United States can seek
asylum -- the right to stay here to avoid persecution in one's own
country. The appeals court must decide after hearing arguments May
11 whether ''any alien'' means even a child of Elian's age acting
against his father's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   To be granted asylum, people must show they were persecuted or
had a legitimate fear of persecution in their home country because
of race, religion, nationality, membership in a social group or
political opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Benitez, a George Washington University law professor
who represents immigration clients, said that if Elian were allowed
to remain in this country, ''I'm going to be one of the first
lawyers to say here are Ethiopian and Somalian and Chinese kids who
want to live here because life is better in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11th Circuit Court's ruling referred to the 1985 case of a
Soviet youth who did not want to return to his home country with
his parents. In that case, a federal appeals court said a
12-year-old was ''presumably near the lower end of an age range''
of maturity to assert rights separate from his parents.
</P>
<P>
   However, several legal experts said there are instances in which
a much younger child could be allowed to pursue an asylum claim --
for example, a girl who faced genital mutilation if returned to her
home country.
</P>
<P>
   Miami lawyer Neal Sonnett, chairman of the American Bar
Association's coordinating committee on immigration law, said that
unless a hearing is held, it is not possible to determine what
weight to give to Elian's views.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th Circuit Court's order did not prevent the government
from reuniting Elian with his father in this country and Attorney
General Janet Reno was considering her next step. The appeals court
also cautioned that ''no one should feel confident in predicting
the eventual result in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court has not yet received the Justice Department's
main brief in the case. White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said
Thursday that government lawyers look forward to making their case
next month that ''the father speaks for the boy and why that's the
legally proper view.''
</P>
<P>
   Benitez said lawyers for Elian's Miami relatives may have their
eye on a federal law known as the Cuban Adjustment Act, which
allows Cubans lawfully on U.S. shores for more than a year to be
granted permanent resident status -- a much easier process than
gaining asylum.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether Elian can apply on his own behalf could
arise there, too, Benitez said. But ''I'm fairly certain his
lawyers are keeping that in the back of their mind,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Earth Day Politics for Gore, Bush  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the administration's point man on the
environment, Vice President Al Gore hopes his ''green'' credentials
will give him an edge over Gov. George W. Bush, who is having to
defend his environmental record in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But as the country celebrates the 30th anniversary of Earth Day,
Gore has yet to energize environmental activists, while Bush has
blunted the issue's influence on the campaign by portraying himself
as a ''common sense'' environmentalist.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will try to buff his image today with a trip to a Detroit
truck yard on behalf of the administration to announce an agreement
with private heavy-duty engine and truck companies to develop
''super fuel-efficient'' pickups, buses, and 18-wheelers within the
next decade to cut greenhouse gas pollutants beyond current
emission standards.
</P>
<P>
   He also plans to participate Saturday in Earth Day celebrations
on the National Mall.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls, including a Gallup survey this week,
suggests voters will reject an anti-environment candidate although
they rank the issue behind the economy, health care and education.
</P>
<P>
   Still, few topics distinguish the two presidential candidates
more than this.
</P>
<P>
   -- Gore wants ratification of a treaty addressing climate change,
arguing that ''greenhouse'' gas emissions can be cut without
harming economic growth; Bush would dump the treaty, saying it
would devastate businesses.
</P>
<P>
   -- Gore vows to block oil drilling in an Alaska Arctic refuge:
Bush, a former oilman, supports such drilling to increase domestic
oil production.
</P>
<P>
   -- Gore has endorsed the Environmental Protection Agency's
aggressive pursuit of tougher federal clean air requirements; Bush
improved air quality can be achieved by working with polluters to
get voluntary reductions -- as he did in Texas. Environmentalists
say that stymied air quality improvements in the state.
</P>
<P>
   -- Gore favors a major federal role in environmental protection;
Bush says states ought to be left alone. He cites state progress in
cleaning industrial areas, known as brownfields, while the federal
Superfund toxic cleanup law has struggled.
</P>
<P>
   While many Republicans and a range of business groups have
sought to portray Gore as an environmental extremist, he has had
some rough going with environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   The issue also has been a sore spot for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, for the first time, Houston overtook Los Angeles
for having the worst smog. And Texas, with a large concentration of
refineries and chemical plants, leads all states in release of
toxic chemicals into the environment. Critics say it is 49th among
states in its support of state parks and, under Bush, has tangled
with the federal government over endangered species protection.
</P>
<P>
   Bush denies he is soft on polluters and tied to industry,
arguing he favors a pragmatic approach to environmental protection.
Business leaders make it clear they would prefer him as president.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Friends of the Earth has not decided whether to
support Gore; it backed rival Bill Bradley during the primaries.
One option is to support consumer activist and Green Party
candidate Ralph Nader, says Brent Blackwelder, the group's
president.
</P>
<P>
   Of Gore, Blackwelder says: ''While the rhetoric is very good,
the understanding is very good, the actions to match the rhetoric
haven't always been forthcoming.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited Gore's failure to support a rapid phase-out of
methylbromide, a widely used pesticide that also destroys the
protective ozone layer in the atmosphere, and Gore's failure to
follow up on a pledge to fight against a toxic waste incinerator in
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also has been accused of not pushing hard enough on climate
change, the one issue he is most closely associated with. He
devoted most of his 1992 book, ''Earth in the Balance,'' to the
need to confront global warming, and he broke the logjam that
cleared the way for a 1997 agreement in Kyoto calling on industrial
nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has been deep concern that this administration hasn't
been as aggressive as it should be on this issue,'' says Phil
Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust.
</P>
<P>
   The Kyoto agreement faces almost certain defeat in Congress,
which must ratify it.
</P>
<P>
   Since the accord, environmentalists argue that the
administration has allowed congressional Republicans to dictate the
climate change agenda, has failed to push for tougher fuel economy
requirements and has accomplished little toward stemming steady
increases in greenhouse gas emissions, mainly carbon dioxide from
burning fossil fuels.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gore is the environmentalists' favorite, said Carl Pope,
executive director of the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   ''The clean air agenda has been largely his agenda,'' says Pope.
''And he gets credit in having turned Bill Clinton into a real
believer on climate change. Bush has said he needs to be judged by
Texas, and if you judge him by Texas, the record is appalling.''
</P>
<P>
   But will the environment emerge as a top election issue?
</P>
<P>
   ''If Bush (is) painted as somebody who's going to destroy the
environment, then it could,'' says Thomas Donohue, president of the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

<HEADLINE> Ralph Nader Campaigns in Kentucky  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE BAILEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- A longtime advocate for the ''little guy''
with his focus on the perceived evils of corporate America, Ralph
Nader now has other targets in sight: the Republican and Democratic
parties as he runs for president under the Green Party banner.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some people like to take on big guys,'' Nader said with a
smirk as he spoke to several hundred supporters Thursday at the
University of Kentucky's Singleton Center for the Arts. ''I like to
take on big guys. Big guys invigorate me. And they should
invigorate you.''
</P>
<P>
   His message was simple: corporations and their lobbyists have
taken over the political system and it is up to citizens to return
the process to its grass-roots origin.
</P>
<P>
   ''You hear so many people today say, 'I'm not into politics,'''
he said. ''Students, if you don't turn on to politics, politics is
going to turn on you. That's a lesson you may learn the hard way.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader, 66, ran for president in 1996, but appeared on less than
one-fourth of state ballots. He did not campaign or raise money and
attracted less than 1 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Nader's goal is to get the party on the ballot
in every state and pull more than 5 percent of the vote, which
would qualify him for millions in federal campaign funds. He
currently polls in single digits, along with Reform Party
presidential candidate Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party currently is on the ballot in 13 states,
including New York and California.
</P>
<P>
   Nader promised to wage ''a campaign in every sense of the
word.''
</P>
<P>
   He is up against a handful of challengers for the Green Party
nomination, including Jello Biafra, former lead singer of the punk
rock band the Dead Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Princeton and Harvard, Nader is a lawyer and
author who has fought to bring progress and reform in the areas of
auto safety, worker rights and environmental preservation. In the
late 1960s, he organized citizen action teams around the country
known as ''Nader's Raiders.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader said his platform will revolve around several issues,
including creating a universal health care system and destroying
corporate America's hold on Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''The two party system is crumbling. (Ross) Perot started that
crumble,'' he said. ''They are hollowed out and don't have much
basic grass-roots support. They're basically two parties with a lot
of money fighting against each other with 30-second electric combat
ads on television.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only way we are going to regain control of our political
institution is to help build a progressive political movement that
will break up the concentration of wealth and power -- a plutocracy
that reigns over our democracy,'' he added.

<HEADLINE> Gore Completes Fund Raising  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE CASS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore is wrapping up his fund raising with
about $9 million remaining to carry his Democratic presidential
campaign through the summer.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, who spent almost twice as much as Gore to
capture the Republican nomination, has less in the bank but is
still raising cash and expects to continue outspending Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore faces a spending limit because he accepted federal matching
funds. Bush, who didn't take the taxpayer money, can spend whatever
he can raise during the remainder of the primary season.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's spent $73.4 million to lock up the GOP nomination. He
spent $10.1 million last month, when he stopped a tough challenge
from Arizona Sen. John McCain, according to Bush's campaign finance
report filed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spent $37.7 million -- including $4.7 million in March -- to
fend off former Sen. Bill Bradley, his Federal Election Commission
report showed.
</P>
<P>
   Because some of that spending was exempt from the legal limit,
Gore can spend $9 million more before bumping the ceiling, said
spokesman Douglas Hattaway. He's already raised almost all of it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We understand that we'll continue to be outspent, but we'll
use our resources wisely and beat him on the issues,'' Hattaway
said of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   As of the end of March, Gore had more money: $8.7 million,
including matching funds due from the government, to Bush's $5.7
million. The figures take into account debt of about $1 million for
each.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McClellan noted that the Texas governor
collected another $1.8 million in the first half of this month, and
plans another fund-raiser in Greensboro, N.C., next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to have plenty of resources to continue spreading
the governor's compassionate conservative message,'' McClellan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither candidate should suffer the fate of 1996 Republican
nominee Bob Dole, who was down to $2 million by this time and
watched his campaign sink from public view while he awaited the
nominating convention, which brings each party nominee an infusion
of taxpayer cash.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will keep raising cash for the Democratic Party even though
he's appeared at his last presidential campaign fund-raiser -- a
$100,000-plus event last weekend at the home of computer company
executive Jesse Singh in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not holding any more events. We will be doing some fund
raising through direct mail and via the Web site,'' Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   Hattaway said Gore expects to qualify for a record $15 million
in federal matching funds for the primary season, surpassing 1996
Republican nominee Bob Dole, who received about $13 million.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers match the first $250 of each individual contribution.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Bush added another 15 names to his list of 156
''Pioneers'' -- fund-raisers who have brought in $100,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Hattaway said Gore, who last year released a list of 25
top-level fund-raisers, doesn't plan to give out any more names.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's big donors included millionaire developer George Argyros
of Costa Mesa, Calif., former owner of the Seattle Mariners;
Gregory Slayton, chairman of the Palo Alto, Calif., tech company My
Software; and Jim Haslam, a Knoxville, Tenn., founder of a chain of
convenience stores.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Huizenga, founder of National Heritage Academies, one of
the nation's largest chains of for-profit charter schools, and Mark
Guzzetta, a fund-raiser for Bush's brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush,
were also on the list.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Gore raised $1.9 million and Bush raised $5.9 million.

<HEADLINE> Gore Has 'Open Mind' About Debates  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore says he has ''an open
mind'' about three-way presidential debates but is unyielding in
his insistence that a court deliberate what is best for Elian
Gonzalez absent a family solution by the Cuban boy's feuding
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   He essentially rejected an appeal by the Cuban boy's father for
public support of a reunion with his 6-year-old son while custody
is litigated.
</P>
<P>
   ''That decision ought to be made according to what is in the
boy's best interest. Usually a family court or a decision maker
following those kinds of procedures gives tremendous weight to the
views and preferences of a surviving parent, but not always if
there are other factors involved,'' Gore, the presumptive
Democratic presidential nominee, said Thursday night on CNN's
''Larry King Live.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not say what other factors should weigh into the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, appealed to the public
Thursday for help persuading the Clinton-Gore administration to end
the five-month father-son separation.
</P>
<P>
   A caller to the talk show told Gore the Miami relatives who have
been caring for the boy were ''breaking the law'' by refusing an
order, after their temporary custody was revoked, to return Elian
to his father who is in the United States but wants to return to

<P>
   ''Do you condone this lawbreaking?'' the caller asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''I advised them to abide by the law and they have said that
they will,'' Gore replied.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Chris Lehane later clarified that Gore has not spoken
with Elian's U.S. relatives. ''That's a public counsel he's
proffered,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier while campaigning in New Jersey, Gore urged the feuding
relatives to try to resolve the custody dispute ''without
government officials or lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked on CNN about another looming political battle, Gore said
he was open to including the Reform Party presidential nominee in
fall presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
   Reform candidate Pat Buchanan has filed a complaint with the
Federal Election Commission arguing for a spot in those key,
nationally televised forums.
</P>
<P>
   The Commission on Presidential Debates has ruled that only
candidates with 15 percent standing in five national public opinion
surveys may participate in the debates. Buchanan, who is seeking
the Reform nomination, polls in single digits.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a mixed feeling about that,'' Gore said. ''It depends
on the level of support that they have, whether it would enhance or
impede the debate. I have an open mind about it. But I think that
we need to know more before a decision like that is made.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on the show with his wife Tipper, another caller asked
whether Gore would consider a Cabinet or other appointment for
Hillary Rodham Clinton if he wins the White House and she loses her
Senate race in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''She would be an excellent public servant in virtually any
position, but that's a hypothetical I'm not going to entertain
because I'm for her and I think she is going to win,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Under daily barbs from the Republican National Committee for
ducking press questions, Gore was ready to commit Thursday to daily
news conferences -- but only if talk-show host King left his desk
and joined Gore on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ''C'mon out. We'll do one every day that you're there,'' Gore
told King. ''That's a promise.''
</P>
<P>
   Replied King, ''I might take you up on those daily
conferences.''

Clinton: Reunite Elian, His Dad
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In his strongest statement to date on the Elian Gonzalez
case, President Clinton said Thursday he knows of ''no conceivable argument''
for preventing the boy and his father from being reunited. He spoke after the
father appealed to the American people to help him regain custody of his
6-year-old son. Clinton commented a day after a three-judge panel of the 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta said that Elian must remain in the
United States until the court decides whether he should get an asylum hearing. A
hearing was set for May 11. Clinton said the ruling erased any argument for
denying a father-son reunion.

   GLENDORA, Calif. (AP) -- California Day-Fresh Foods has pulled orange and
grapefruit juice, lemonade and other drinks from store shelves in six states

a precaution after some people came down with salmonella in Southern California,
Nevada and Colorado after drinking the products, company spokeswoman Judy Lynes
said Thursday. Fourteen cases have been reported, said Ruth Welch of the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration. Symptoms of salmonella include fever, severe

   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- The High Court ruled Friday that Malaysia's
prime minister is not required to testify in the sex trial of an ousted deputy
premier, deflating defense hopes of proving the charges are politically
motivated. Anwar jumped up, shook his fist at the judge and then pounded it on
the wooden guard rail. ''Where is justice in this court?'' he shouted. ''You
should not allow him to hide behind his executive privilege.'' The judge's
decision ended six months of legal wrangling over a defense subpoena for the
prime minister to answer questions regarding an alleged political conspiracy to
frame Anwar.

   LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- In memory of the school shooting massacre,
Coloradans fell silent while a church bell tolled 13 times at 11:21 a.m.
Thursday, the precise moment two teen-agers opened fire in Columbine High School
on April 20, 1999. At private ceremonies and public remembrances all day and
into the night today, students, staff, survivors and strangers came together to
mark the first anniversary of the nation's deadliest school shooting. Gov. Bill
Owens presided over the moment of silence at the state Capitol in Denver that
marked the moment Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris began the bloodbath, killing 12
students and a teacher and wounding 26 before taking their own lives.

   DOKCHON, South Korea (AP) -- According to declassified U.S. military
documents and witnesses, South Korean soldiers and police, observed at times by
U.S. Army officers, executed more than 2,000 political prisoners without trial
in the early weeks of the Korean War. Supreme commander Gen. Douglas MacArthur
became aware of at least one of the mass shootings, according to documents
originally classified ''top secret.'' The new information, detailed in reporting
by The Associated Press and a Korean researcher, substantiates what some
historians have long believed: Large numbers of South Korean leftists arrested
by the right-wing regime were secretly killed.

<HEADLINE> Rails to Trails Compromise Sought  </HEADLINE>
By LIBBY QUAID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For as long as abandoned rail lines have been
turned into trails for running, hiking and biking, property owners
and trail supporters have clashed over use of the land.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Ryun, a champion runner who still holds the U.S. high
school mile record, has a bill that offers a compromise to
landowners who say their rights are trampled when their land is
taken for trails and outdoor enthusiasts who want more trails.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sharp departure for Ryun, R-Kan., who has been vilified
by trail enthusiasts for previous attempts to simply return
abandoned rights of way to property owners, letting them decide
whether trails would be developed.
</P>
<P>
   Since passage of the 1983 National Trails System Act, more than
1,000 trails have been created from abandoned rail lines with
permission from the federal Surface Transportation Board, which
reviews applications.
</P>
<P>
   Ryun's bill would amend the act to say abandoned lines on
private property may not be converted to a trail ''unless fair and
reasonable compensation'' is offered to the landowner. No
compensation must be offered now.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a commonsense bill that follows a rule we should have all
learned in kindergarten, and that is, you ask for permission before
you take what isn't yours,'' said Ryun, who often runs on rail
trails.
</P>
<P>
   ''This allows the farmer or landowner to have a voice. It
doesn't really stop the development of trails. If nobody is willing
to pay ... then the farmer should be able to keep his land.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has upheld the government's right to convert
unused railroad rights of way to trails through ''railbanking,''
which preserves the land in case railroads want to resume using it,
even if the landowner opposes the move.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, railroads only had temporary ownership of an
easement, meaning the right of way reverted to the original
property owner when the railroad line was abandoned.
''Railbanking'' declares that the line is not abandoned and is
still in use, which means the railroad retains ownership of the
easement. In cases of temporary easements, the law says they still
are part of the property owned by the private individual.
</P>
<P>
   Ryun's bill was prompted by a ruling in January by U.S. Court of
Claims Judge Eric Bruggink that the government must pay hundreds of
Missourians who own land along the 200-mile Katy Trail and 6.2-mile
Grant's Trail.
</P>
<P>
   Jayne Glosemeyer, a lead plaintiff in the case, said she never
opposed having a section of Katy Trail on her Marthasville, Mo.,
hog farm, but wanted it rerouted away from her breeding stock,
fattening pens and farrowing huts.
</P>
<P>
   Because trail users were disrupting her animals, she ended up
moving her operation to rented land two miles away, at a cost of
about $20,000 per year. The 14-year legal battle, combined with
plummeting prices, pushed Glosemeyer out of the hog business.
</P>
<P>
   Ryun's legislation would require trail developers to negotiate
purchase terms before conversion work begins. If no agreement can
be reached, either side may go to court.
</P>
<P>
   David Burwell, president of the Rails-to-Trails Conservancy,
doesn't like the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't see any reason why (compensation) should hold up
trail development. They don't do that for highways; why should they
for trails?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to other decisions where judges have ruled against
landowners, most recently in a federal appeals court ruling saying
no compensation was required for railbanking of the Capitol
Crescent Trail, which runs through Washington and into neighboring
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Road Runners Club of America executive director Henley Gabeau
called Ryun's bill ''another huge stumbling block'' for outdoor
enthusiasts that could mean years in court before a trail is
developed.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Premier Seeks Forgiveness  </HEADLINE>
By VESELIN TOSHKOV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) -- Prime Minister Ivan Kostov is admitting
his government made mistakes in the fight against corruption and is
asking the public to forgive him.
</P>
<P>
   Kostov is beset by allegations made by his former interior
minister, Bogomil Bonev, that he covered up intelligence reports
citing specific senior officials as corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   The charges have unleashed a political storm in Bulgaria, where
many people are growing impatient with waiting for improvements in
the economy to trickle down to the ordinary citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Kostov is expected to appear before parliament today to discuss
the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   With average salaries around $110 a month, a growing number of
Bulgarians suspect a few politically well-connected people are the
only ones to have profited from the improvement in the economy
since Kostov took office in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In a nationwide television address Thursday, Kostov admitted he
and his government had made mistakes but said that he will continue
to fulfill his duties.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know that I have made mistake, but I know that (the people)
will forgive me,'' Kostov said. ''I will not drop my
responsibilities as prime minister.''
</P>
<P>
   He also denied allegations of a possible split in the ranks of
his pro-Western Union of Democratic Forces, which could cause a
government crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier public comments, President Petar Stoyanov had urged
Kostov to be ''as honest as possible'' to Bulgarians angry about
the reported corruption.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, one day after Bonev made his allegations, Kostov's
spokesman, Mihail Mihailov, stepped down after a trade union leader
accused him of accepting a bribe to grant a broadcast license.
</P>
<P>
   Mihailov denied the charge but said he was giving up his post to
devote full time to clearing his name.
</P>
<P>
   Stoyanov said that both the UDF leadership and the government
made numerous mistakes, which worsened after the October 1999 local
elections ''due to a lack of courage and resolve on the part of
Prime Minister Kostov, among other things.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What now Bogomil Bonev says, many Bulgarians accept because he
is saying the things Kostov should have said six months ago,''
Stoyanov said.
</P>
<P>
   The main opposition Socialist Party said Wednesday it will push
for a no-confidence vote in parliament against the government.
</P>
<P>
   Although it holds 137 of the 240 seats in the body, the UDF may
be divided over the corruption accusations, meaning some of its
members may vote against the government and with the Socialists.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Hometown Becoming Impatient  </HEADLINE>
By VIVIAN SEQUERA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARDENAS, Cuba (AP) -- For people here in Elian Gonzalez's
hometown, the solution seems simple: Take the 6-year-old boy from
the house where he is staying in Miami and reunite him with his
father.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta ruled that
Elian must remain in the United States until the court decides
whether he should get an asylum hearing, aggravating impatience in
this town 60 miles east of Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the frustration is the failure to reunite the boy with
his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who went to the United States two
weeks ago but has not yet seen the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now it's time to do something. I don't see any other way. He
has to be taken out,'' said Belkis Rodriguez, a 31-year-old
accountant with two children.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, ''they say that if they go in and take him it will
cause him harm, but they don't say how much harm all this is doing
to him: the interviews, demonstrations. That causes him more harm
than if a battalion went in.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian was found clinging to an inner tube off the Florida coast
in November after his mother and several others died in the attempt
to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He has been staying with his great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, who
has fought to keep the child in the United States even though U.S.
officials revoked Elian's temporary custody last week. The father
wants to bring him back to the family home in Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   ''It only takes a moment. Grab the boy and bring him to the
father,'' said Calixto Felipe, a retired construction worker.
</P>
<P>
   He complained that Attorney General Janet Reno had been slow to
act.
</P>
<P>
   ''What you have is driveling,'' with much talk but little
action, said Felipe, 70, in his wood-walled house adorned with
portraits of President Fidel Castro and revolutionary hero Ernesto
''Che'' Guevara.
</P>
<P>
   Walls and doors throughout Cardenas, a city of 70,000 people,
are plastered with posters bearing Elian's image. People here
follow every development in the case of the child who has become
the town's most famous son.
</P>
<P>
   His school desk remains empty and waiting, and a small museum
dedicated to the case has been set up.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow students and his teachers appear regularly on state
television. The government has asked the United States to let them
visit so that Elian will see familiar faces from home when he
finally leaves the Miami house.
</P>
<P>
   ''What Reno has to do is order in her people and it's over, but
every day there are more excuses,'' said Hilda Ordonez. ''They
should have acted from the first day. What the father must feel is
powerlessness.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday in Washington, Juan Miguel Gonzalez asked the U.S.
people to urge their leaders to return the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't let them continue to abuse my son,'' he said, referring
to the Miami relatives who have been caring for Elian since
November.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban government, meanwhile, kept up its campaign of rallies
demanding the child's return. Roughly 100,000 supporters gathered
Thursday, chanting and waving flags in front of the U.S. Interests
Section here.

<HEADLINE> Chapman Wins Six Dove Awards  </HEADLINE>
By JIM PATTERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Steven Curtis Chapman, a longtime Dove
Awards favorite, dominated again with six awards -- including best
artist -- at the ceremony honoring Christian music.
</P>
<P>
   In his acceptance speech Thursday, Chapman, 37, spoke of a topic
close to his heart -- adoption.
</P>
<P>
   The singer brought his wife and three children on stage to share
the best artist award, and introduced a new fourth child --
7-month-old daughter Shaohannah Hope, whom he recently adopted in
China.
</P>
<P>
   ''If other folks go, 'Hey the Chapmans are crazy enough to do
this,' then maybe they'll consider that too, and one or two more
little babies will find a home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman has won 44 Dove Awards, more than any other performer.
He has won for best artist five previous times.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Chapman also garnered best male vocalist, best
pop-contemporary album for ''Speechless'' and best pop-contemporary
single for ''Dive.'' He won two awards apiece in the single and
album categories, because he produced as well as performed on them.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's best artist Michael W. Smith won best song for
''This is Your Time,'' a song inspired by the Columbine High School
shootings. He performed it during the awards show, which took place
exactly a year after the tragedy in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis Rams quarterback Kurt Warner presented the best song
award to Smith along with Tennessee Titans coach Jeff Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I'll let you handle this trophy. I got the last one,''
Warner said to Fisher, referring to the Rams victory over the
Titans in this year's Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In other major categories, Sixpence None the Richer was named
best group, Jaci Velasquez won her second straight best female
vocalist award, and Ginny Owens won best new artist.
</P>
<P>
   ''What a strange thing it is to be rewarded for a gift that only
God could have given,'' Owens said.
</P>
<P>
   Country star Glen Campbell was awarded best country album for
''A Glen Campbell Christmas.'' George Jones won a Dove for best
country recorded song for ''Angel Band,'' his duet with Vestal
Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   Kathie Lee Gifford, the awards show's hostess, performed a duet
with Dolly Parton, ''Only My Pillow Knows,'' and said she hoped the
show would ''remind people of the incredible diversity that make up
gospel music in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ''The message hasn't changed, but the music certainly has,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Awards were passed out in 43 categories at the Grand Ole Opry
House, seven during the television show scheduled to air in more
than 100 markets over the next week. Dove Award winners are
nominated and selected by 5,500 members of the Gospel Music
Association, which was founded in 1964 to promote Christian music.

<HEADLINE> IOC: Athens Games Could Be in Danger  </HEADLINE>
BY ERICA BULMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- While IOC president Juan Antonio
Samaranch doesn't envision moving the 2004 Games from Athens
despite an impending organizational crisis, neither did the
Spaniard entirely rule out the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch delivered an unusually harsh warning to Athens
organizers Thursday, saying the host's organizational problems
could jeopardize the games and leaving his ominous threat hanging.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cannot imagine the games will not be held in Athens,''
Samaranch said following meetings between the IOC and the heads of
Olympic federations. ''They have the capacity to stage the games.
We hope after this warning things will be in the right way. We are
fully optimistic there will be changes very soon.
</P>
<P>
   ''If at the end of the year no measures have been taken, then we
will see.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC is troubled that Greece -- birthplace of the Olympics --
has failed to deliver and faces major problems and delays in
preparations for the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Rogge, who heads the IOC panel that oversees the Athens
Games, listed problems in accommodations, traffic, security,
communications, construction, venues and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole structure must be revamped,'' Rogge said.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch said it was the worst organizational crisis faced by
an Olympic city during his 20-year presidency of the International
Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Treading carefully, the IOC refused to suggest it was thinking
of moving the 2004 Games.
</P>
<P>
   ''Frankly speaking, we have no backup plan,'' Rogge said. ''A
backup plan midstage is almost impossible. To start from scratch
would be almost impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be most unfair for Greece to talk of backup plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Never in the movement's history has the IOC revoked the Olympic
Games from a host city, though on four occasions war forced the
event to be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, Denver backed out of hosting the games itself, troubled
by a possible drain on taxpayers' wallets and worried about what
the event might do to the environment.
</P>
<P>
   In 1908, host city Rome fell into financial turmoil and gave up
the Olympics, which were picked up by London.
</P>
<P>
   But if the IOC refused to speculate about a change in venues, it
never categorically ruled out the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Moving the games may not be advisable, said IOC vice president
Dick Pound, but it is not impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would have to be a major crisis, but, we can do that,''
Pound said. ''But you're better off dancing with the girl you
brought than changing midstream.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did it when Denver backed out of the 1976 Games. We cast
about and found Innsbruck. It can be done, but we sure don't like
to do it. It's not good for us, it's not good for Greece and it's
not good for the games.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch had already warned Greek organizers privately a few
months ago, but waited to go public until after the Greek elections
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   However, Greek representatives appeared to feel the warning was
overblown.
</P>
<P>
   Costas Bakouris, managing director of the Athens organizing
committee, said the IOC's comments were ''exaggerated.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They wanted us to move faster and we are now moving faster,''
Greek IOC member Lambis Nikolaou said. ''We have the support of the
government.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of issues which need to be settled, and we're
working on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Athens, which staged the first modern games in 1896, was awarded
the 2004 Olympics in September 1997. Since then, many of the plans
have been changed or dropped, and the organizing committee has been
hopelessly entangled in government bureaucracy.

   GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Brian Henninger would like to think of
himself as a little guy with a big golf game.
</P>
<P>
   But the 5-foot-8 Henninger admits his aggressive play earlier in
the season got him into trouble, resulting in six missed cuts in 11
PGA Tour events.
</P>
<P>
   Henninger said he backed off a little Thursday during the first
round of the $3 million Greater Greensboro Chrysler Classic,
enabling him to shoot a 6-under-par 66 to share the lead with Scott
Verplank.
</P>
<P>
   Henninger said his recent golfing adversity was actually caused
by a successful 1999 campaign in which he earned $774,486,
including one win and three other top 10 finishes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somewhere your mind gets twisted and you think you're shooting
all these great scores, you might as well just continue,'' he said.
''But you just can't force the feel, you have to feel the force.
</P>
<P>
   ''All we do is manage ourselves around out there,'' Henninger
added. ''Just playing quadrant golf, and when I do that, I'm
playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Henninger parred the first six holes at Forest Oaks Country Club
before going on a birdie tear, reeling off five in a row and seven
in eight holes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't counting,'' Henninger said. ''Somebody asked me if I
made eight or nine birdies, and I said, 'I don't know.' That's when
you're playing good, when you're not worried about making a birdie
on the next hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal Sutton, who won this year's Players Championship, was one
shot back at 67, along with Sean Murphy, Omar Uresti and Doug
Dunakey, who birdied his final three holes in the late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt at ease the last three holes,'' said Dunakey, who
hasn't made a cut and was playing his first PGA Tour event in six
weeks. ''Normally, I'm nervous, whether I'm in last place or first
place. It just happened that the swing felt good and I hit some
good shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton holed a pitching wedge from 130 yards for an eagle on the
fifth hole to key his round, while Murphy made putts from 40 and 50
feet to secure his 5-under.
</P>
<P>
   ''My putter was definitely my best friend, no doubt about it,''
Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Jesper Parnevik, who set the 72-hole record here at 23-under in
a wire-to-wire victory last year, shot a 69.
</P>
<P>
   Verplank, who lost a playoff here to Trevor Dodds in 1998 and
hasn't won on tour since 1988, got to 7-under, but bogeyed his
final hole after a poor approach shot to close with a 66 -- his best
round of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't feel like I played great,'' Verplank said. ''But I hit
the ball in the fairway and on the green, and I hit it close enough
to make some birdies.''
</P>
<P>
   Six of Verplank's birdie putts were from 7 feet or closer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what happened last year other than I didn't make
my putts,'' Verplank said of a season in which he finished 82nd on
the money list and had just one top-10 finish. ''But I've played
pretty decent in the last month. I feel like I'm doing the right
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6,958-yard layout at Forest Oaks is considered one of the
tour's tougher tests, with 5-inch rough that can make for a long
day. But for the second straight year, scores were low despite
windy conditions and rain Tuesday that softened the course.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-eight of the 155 players shot par or better.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's some potential to score out here, even though you
don't think there is,'' Henninger said.

<HEADLINE> NBA Today  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressSCOREBOARD:
Thursday, April 20:
<TEXT>
<P>
   No games scheduled until playoffs begin Saturday.
STARTING UP:
</P>
<P>
   The playoffs begin Saturday at 12:30 p.m. EDT with Game 1 of the
Detroit-Miami series.
SPREAD OUT:
</P>
<P>
   In a change designed to improve the NBA's cable television
ratings, the first-round matchups are spread over two weeks, with
loads of downtime between games. For example: Game 1 of the
Kings-Lakers series is on Sunday, and the teams don't play again
until Thursday. The Seattle-Seattle Utah series has a four-day
break between Game 2 on Monday and Game 3 on Saturday, then a
three-day break before Game 4 the following Wednesday. The
elongated schedule is part of Turner Sports' new television
contract. Rather than having four games per night, as was the case
in previous years, the games are more spread out so TNT and TBS --
the two Turner networks -- will not compete head-to-head for viewers
on weeknights.
STATS:
</P>
<P>
   The Charlotte Hornets won 14 of their final 16 games to gain
homecourt advantage over the Philadelphia 76ers. ... The Minnesota
Timberwolves were 50-32, the best record in franchise history. ...
The Los Angeles Lakers won 33 of their final 37 games. They will
have homecourt advantage as long as they stay alive.
STRONG AT HOME:
</P>
<P>
   The Eastern Conference-leading Indiana Pacers went 36-5 in their
new Conseco Fieldhouse -- matching the Western Conference-leading
Los Angeles Lakers for the league's top record at home.
SEASON OF FUTILITY:
</P>
<P>
   At 17-65, the 1999-00 Chicago Bulls had by far the worst record
in team history. Despite 32 more chances, they managed only four
more victories than last year's hastily assembled post-lockout
squad that barely knew each other's names. Only one other Bulls
team won less than 30 percent of its games in a full season, and
the 1975-76 squad at least managed to win 29 percent (24-58).
SPEAKING:
</P>
<P>
   ''We are subject to the gods of television, but to stretch this
out over two weeks is absolutely insane. It's losing its
competitive edge. It's allowing guys to have more preparation. It's
allowing people to almost get bored. You've made them wait all year
long, 82 games, and now you're going to make them wait two weeks to
get through five games?'' -- Miami coach Pat Riley, speaking about
the fact that the Heat's best-of-five playoff series against the
Detroit Pistons will be spread over 13 days to accommodate
television. The teams have three days off before Game 3 in Detroit,
then three more days off before Game 4, also in Detroit.

<HEADLINE> TV Dictates NBA Playoffs Schedule  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN, AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   No two teams have less time to prepare for the playoffs than Pat
Riley's team, the Miami Heat, and their opponent, the Detroit
Pistons. They have the first tipoff early Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   That'll be less than 72 hours after the teams ended the regular
season, but like everyone else, the Heat and Pistons will find
themselves waiting around in the ensuing days.
</P>
<P>
   In a change from past practice, the first round of the NBA
playoffs is being spread over 13 days so that games won't compete
head-to-head for viewers on TNT and TBS.
</P>
<P>
   For Riley's team and their opponent, the Detroit Pistons, it
means a Saturday-Tuesday-Saturday schedule -- that's eight days
overall -- for just the first three games.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are subject to the gods of television, but to stretch this
out over two weeks is absolutely insane,'' Riley said Thursday.
''It's losing its competitive edge. It's allowing guys to have more
preparation. It's allowing people to almost get bored. You've made
them wait all year long, 82 games, and now you're going to make
them wait two weeks to get through five games?''
</P>
<P>
   If the Miami-Detroit schedule is odd, consider the Lakers-Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Game 1 is Sunday, Game 2 is Thursday, Game 3 is the following
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Even stranger is the Utah-Seattle series, which features four
days off between Game 2 Monday and Game 3 the following Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's ideal, but that's the way it is,'' Knicks
coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ''It's for the benefit of TV. Whatever
the schedule is, that's how we have to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix-San Antonio, Seattle-Utah, Detroit-Miami and
Philadelphia-Charlotte series begin Saturday, and the other four
series -- Raptors-Knicks, Timberwolves-Trail Blazers, Kings-Lakers
and 76ers-Hornets -- start Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   There will be Game 2 doubleheaders Monday through Thursday, and
there's only one Game 3 next Friday night -- Hornets-76ers.
</P>
<P>
   The downside of the new schedule is a big cut in preparation
time before the openers. Teams used to have four or five days to
rest weary limbs, break down videotape and study opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they have to get ready quick.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the first-round matchups, the two most intriguing ones
are Kings-Lakers and Raptors-Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're expecting a war,'' Toronto's Vince Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks figure to have their hands full against a Toronto
team that clobbered them in the season series, winning 3-1, with
all the victories blowouts.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the first postseason appearance for the Raptors and
their young superstar.
</P>
<P>
   The defending champion Spurs secured homecourt advantage for the
first round by beating the Lakers on Wednesday night in the
regular-season finale, but that was about the only good news to be
had in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs' franchise player, Tim Duncan, has torn cartilage in
his left knee, and his availability for the series against Phoenix
is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan's injury is one of several to strike playoff-bound teams
and their stars.
</P>
<P>
   No team is worse off than the Suns, who have lost two starters --
Jason Kidd and Tom Gugliotta. Kidd was placed on the playoff roster
Thursday, but it's unlikely he'll play.
</P>
<P>
   Miami will have to try to get past Detroit with a rookie,
Anthony Carter, playing point guard because Tim Hardaway has a foot
injury that is expected to sideline him for at least the first
round.
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons aren't immune, either, with Grant Hill nursing a
bruised ankle that kept him out of their final four games.
</P>
<P>
   The Milwaukee Bucks, the last team to qualify for the playoffs,
caught an injury break when they learned that Ray Allen's sprained
left knee is OK. Allen even played Wednesday night -- extending his
consecutive games streak to 296 -- and leaped off his left leg for a
dunk.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks get a rematch with the top-seeded Indiana Pacers, who
swept them from the playoffs in the opening round last season.
</P>
<P>
   The big difference for Milwaukee this year is that Sam Cassell
is healthy, while the Pacers will be entering the final postseason
of Larry Bird's coaching career minus some of the toughness they
had in years past with Davis. The Pacers also have four starters
who will be free agents this summer, and the team could look a lot
different next season if it again fails to make it past the
conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento lost the season series 3-1 to the Lakers, but the
losses were by 1, 7 and 3 points.
</P>
<P>
   ''They get pumped up for us,'' Shaquille O'Neal said. ''Certain
teams get pumped up against other teams, and they get pumped up for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers probably would have preferred to face Seattle in the
first round, but the Sonics got the seventh seed Tuesday night by
winning in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle will instead face Utah, while the Lakers get an opponent
that presents matchup problems in the frontcourt with Chris Webber
and Vlade Divac playing alongside each other. Shaq can't guard them
both, and Sacramento could provide a test of whether the Lakers are
as invincible as they seemed during the final two months of the
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers won 33 of 35 games before losing their final two.
They will have homecourt advantage as long as they stay alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Lakers are the favorites,'' Utah's John Stockton said.
''They have been terrific all year and have been dominating all
year. I understand why they have been placed in that role, but you
still have to play the games.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the dark-horse teams heading into the postseason are
Charlotte and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets won 14 of their final 16 games to gain homecourt
advantage over the 76ers, whose best player, Allen Iverson, will
play with a swollen shooting elbow and broken toe.
</P>
<P>
   The Timberwolves were 50-32 for the best record in franchise
history, but it won't mean much unless Minnesota can break its
two-year cycle of first-round failures.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolves will have to reverse their fortunes against the team
that finished with the league's second-best record, Portland
(59-23), which has one of the deepest, most playoff-tested rosters
in the league.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Preparing for New Season  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- The Los Angeles Lakers enjoyed a
wonderful regular season, winning eight more games than anyone else
in the NBA and recording the second-highest victory total in
franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as coach Phil Jackson points out, they're starting over,
dead even with the other 15 teams in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's just say this is one segment and we've got that over
with,'' Jackson said Thursday at the team's practice facility.
''The surprise is that we got 67 victories, which is a substantial
amount.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here it is, this is the moment we all play the games for.
There are no easy routes. There's more intensity, more pressure on
the players. We're going to climb this mountain together over the
next few weeks, and see where we go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, who had winning streaks of 16, 19 and 11 games
during a 67-15 regular season, open the postseason Sunday against
the Sacramento Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 at Staples Center in the best-of-five first-round series
isn't until Thursday night, prompting Jackson to say, ''I believe
(the layoff) favors Sacramento, and I will tell you why; they'll be
able to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Kings spokesman Troy Hanson said the Kings will fly to Los
Angeles after practice Saturday and return home after Sunday's game
before flying back to Southern California on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The team enters the playoffs in relatively good health,''
Hanson added.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings have played the Lakers tough this season, beating them
once and losing three times, but by only seven, one and three
points. However, Sacramento enters the postseason on a downer,
losing seven of its last eight games, including the final four.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know, maybe the pressure at the end of the season or
the injuries they had,'' Jackson said when asked his opinion on the
late-season slump. ''I know they played us well last Friday (in a
121-114 Los Angeles victory). I've got to give them credit on
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers also finished the season on a losing note, falling at
Dallas and San Antonio this week, but Jackson said, ''These last
two games have no bearing on our year at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers lost three of their last six games, but that was
after they clinched the NBA's best record and homecourt advantage
throughout the playoffs. And O'Neal missed a win and a loss because
of a slightly sprained ankle that shouldn't be a problem in the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a team, I think we're relatively healthy,'' Jackson said.
''We just want good physical health. I think if we can maintain
that, we'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, who averaged an NBA-leading 29.7 points
and 22.5 points, respectively, both have nagging injuries, but
Lakers spokesman John Black said both planned to practice today.
Jackson gave the team Thursday off.
</P>
<P>
   X-rays on Bryant's right wrist early Thursday were negative.
Black said Bryant injured his wrist in Dallas on Tuesday night and
fell on it early in Wednesday night's game in San Antonio, but
wound up scoring 23 points in 42 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was called for a technical foul in overtime of the
Lakers' 103-98 loss in San Antonio after turning his elbow into
David Robinson's stomach. Robinson went down, grimacing in pain.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'd been hard fouled, hurt his shoulder again in the third
quarter,'' Jackson said of O'Neal. ''It looked like Robinson fouled
him at least two times before they called the foul. It's obvious
this league doesn't call flagrant fouls against Shaquille.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers submitted their playoff roster, which includes guard
Derek Fisher, who missed the final four regular-season games due to
a bone spur in his right ankle. Rookie John Celestand, activated
when Fisher was placed on the injured list last week, was removed
from the roster.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's practiced limited, just shooting, the last three days,''
Jackson said. ''He'll star going all-out tomorrow. We'll need a
smaller guard at times.''

<HEADLINE> Milwaukee Heads for Postseason  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. FRANCIS, Wis. (AP) -- In the spring, young men's thoughts
turn to baseball -- even if those young men are getting ready for
the NBA playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   At their plush training facility on the fog-shrouded shores of
Lake Michigan on Thursday, the Milwaukee Bucks seemed relaxed,
refreshed, ready for the postseason -- and even a little bit
preoccupied with the summer game.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, guard Rafer Alston flipped through the sports pages to
learn more about his hometown New York Yankees' eight-game winning
streak. ''They should put us in our own league!'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Downstairs, Tim Thomas, Robert Traylor and Danny Manning took
advantage of a break in the Bucks' day of two practices and three
hours of mandatory film study to break out their baseball mitts and
play catch on the practice floor, rolling grounders across the
polished hardwood.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just look around, see how relaxed we are,'' Thomas said. ''The
pressure is on Indiana. They're supposed to take care of us. We're
going in there with everything to gain.''
</P>
<P>
   The first game of eighth-seeded Milwaukee's playoff rematch with
the Indiana Pacers isn't until Sunday. The Bucks ended the season
with three straight victories -- matching their longest winning
streak of the year -- and 11 wins in the last 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're feeling good, we're feeling loose and we're feeling
dangerous,'' said Glenn Robinson, who has been in just three
playoff games in six years with Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the first time since I've been here, I feel like this team
can do some damage in the playoffs. We're really pumped up around
here.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a serious rally in the season's final month for the
Bucks to leap past ninth-place Orlando and into the playoffs, but
coach George Karl has already declared the season a success for his
young, inexperienced team.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got improvement in all the areas I wanted to improve, so I
call that a success,'' said Karl, citing his team's ''increased
effort and better knowledge of each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Bucks can get down to the business of challenging the
top-seeded Pacers, with whom they split their four-game season
series. Milwaukee blew out Indiana twice and was one of just five
visiting teams to win at Conseco Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's unfinished business for us down there,'' leading
scorer Ray Allen said. ''Last year, we got swept by them because we
didn't know what the playoffs were all about. This year, we know a
little bit more.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks will return home during the three days between the
first and second games at Conseco Fieldhouse. Milwaukee's first
home playoff game won't be played until April 29.
</P>
<P>
   While none of the Bucks was pleased by the NBA's TV-friendly
schedule, Allen was grateful for three more days to rest his
sprained left knee. Allen said he expects the injury to be nothing
more than a dull ache by Sunday's Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to say I'll be 100 percent, but I know I won't be,''
Allen said. ''But at the same time, it's nothing huge. It won't
prevent me from shooting or defending or doing the things I want to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more important than Allen's physical health is the
solid mental health of the team.
</P>
<P>
   After a year in which Karl publicly ripped the defensive play
and leadership of his Big Three -- Allen, Robinson and Sam Cassell --
the Bucks' leaders and their coach seem to be the picture of
domestic bliss.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything is coming together for us at the right time,''
Cassell said. ''It's been a long road, but we're all on the same
page now. I feel good about where we're at.''

<HEADLINE> Thousands march to City Hall, voice anger at mayor  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Vowing to make sure Mayor Rudolph Giuliani does
not win his bid for the U.S. Senate, more than 2,000 protesters
marched several miles, from Brooklyn to City Hall, shouting that
the mayor has mishandled several fatal police shootings of unarmed
men. They also called for him to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ''Amadou Diallo! Patrick Dorismond! Malcolm Ferguson!'' shouted
the mostly Haitian-American crowd on Thursday. ''Giuliani must
go!''
</P>
<P>
   Diallo was fatally shot last year by four white police officers
-- they were acquitted of murder charges earlier this year.
Dorismond was fatally shot outside a Manhattan bar, and Ferguson
was killed during an undercover drug raid, both in March.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, Giuliani has vociferously defended the police. He
sometimes sought to shift blame for the shootings to the victims
and raised the ire of many people by releasing Dorismond's sealed
juvenile record.
</P>
<P>
   ''You all have got to vote!'' shouted Marie Dorismond,
Dorismond's sister. ''All of this will mean nothing if you don't
vote. One vote will make one big difference. I'm tired of crying
for black brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no mention by speakers at the rally that if Giuliani
loses the Senate race in November -- his Democratic opponent is
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton -- he would remain mayor until
2001.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters also voiced anger toward the NYPD, but their
focus was Giuliani, and many signs depicted the mayor as the devil
or Adolf Hitler. The signs were cheered by about a hundred
onlookers as the marchers came off the Brooklyn Bridge into
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Giuliani violates human rights,'' ''Giuliani, the new
Hitler,'' and ''Stop and frisk Giuliani, book him up for racism,''
read some of the signs.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's office did not immediately return a telephone call
seeking comment on the signs, but at his daily press availability --
held before the marchers left Brooklyn -- the mayor mentioned the
protesters briefly.
</P>
<P>
   ''People have a right to protest, I really have no problem with
that at all as long as they do it peacefully,'' he said. ''If they
don't do it peacefully, then they also have to be ready to be
arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   The march and subsequent rally outside City Hall were peaceful,
and Dorismond's father, Andre, begged the large crowd to remain
calm. Following his son's funeral last month, a melee broke out
between some mourners and police, with injuries on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ''Keep the pressure on, keep the pressure on,'' said Dorismond,
a Haitian immigrant. ''But no violence, please. No violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond's mother, named Marie like her daughter, shouted
passionately in Creole: ''They killed my son but I didn't lose the
battle!''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd cheered loudest for Abner Louima, the Haitian
immigrant tortured by a police officer in the bathroom of a
Brooklyn stationhouse in 1997. The soft-spoken Louima talked about
how black people are viewed by police.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are tired of being portrayed as drug dealers, we are tired
of being portrayed as criminals,'' Louima said. ''We want to be
judged for our actions, not our skin color.''
</P>
<P>
   Louima, who was flanked by a police detective as he stood on the
dais, was then led through the crowd into a car by police, who had
accompanied him to the rally. Louima has been under police
protection since his attack.
</P>
<P>
   Missing from the rally was one of its organizers, the Rev. Al
Sharpton, who had a prior speaking engagement in Philadelphia.
Sharpton and his National Action Network held several rallies this
week protesting police brutality, culminating in Thursday's march
and rally. Several people, including Sharpton, were arrested at
those rallies after staging acts of civil disobedience, such as

<HEADLINE> Amato May Become Italy's Premier  </HEADLINE>
By CANDACE HUGHES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Treasury Minister Giuliano Amato, nicknamed ''Dr.
Subtle'' for his skill at trimming government spending, was on
track to become Italy's next premier in an effort to avoid early
elections.
</P>
<P>
   President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi was scheduled to finish
consultations today with the nation's political leaders on a
replacement for Premier Massimo D'Alema, who resigned this week.
</P>
<P>
   The president has the option of calling a special election, but
is unlikely to do so because it would block a referendum on
reforming the electoral system that he wants to see go through.
</P>
<P>
   The center-left has promised to offer Ciampi a single candidate
to replace D'Alema. Socialist leader Enrico Boselli said Amato was
expected to get the coalition's nod. Other leftist leaders said the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Amato, 61, was premier in 1992 and 1993 and faced a currency
crisis that forced him to devalue the lira.
</P>
<P>
   Amato, a professor of constitutional law, was expected to return
to Italy today from World Bank and International Monetary Fund
meetings in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative opposition led by media mogul Silvio Berlusconi
wants Ciampi to call elections now, a year ahead of schedule. But
in an interview with The Associated Press, the ex-premier seemed
resigned to a wait.
</P>
<P>
   ''I fear there won't be a vote until 2001,'' Berlusconi said,
complaining that the center-left would come up with a ''useful
idiot'' to run the country until then.
</P>
<P>
   Berlusconi insisted Italians will return him to power in the
next election despite a corruption conviction and more trials
ahead. He is also viewed with suspicion in Europe for hanging on to
a media empire while in politics.
</P>
<P>
   His conservative candidates swept to victory in eight of 15
regional races over the weekend, prompting D'Alema's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema, the first ex-Communist to lead Italy, came close to
setting a record for short-lived governments in a country famous
for its ''revolving door'' leadership. He was in power 18 months
and headed both the 56th and 57th governments since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with state TV, D'Alema said Thursday he was
opposed to early elections and chastised Berlusconi for his
''useful idiot'' comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''We passed through an election campaign that was among the
ugliest in democratic history,'' D'Alema said. ''Now the campaign
is over.
</P>
<P>
   ''Berlusconi, wait a few more months.''
</P>
<P>
   Berlusconi's loathing of leftists, whom he blames for his legal
woes, was clear throughout the hour-long interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''D'Alema has been dozens of times to Moscow. He has eaten bread
and communism at the table with his father, a Communist deputy,''
Berlusconi said.
</P>
<P>
   Berlusconi has been tried four times on charges ranging from
bribing tax inspectors to illegal party financing. He was convicted
three times. Two convictions were thrown out on first appeal, with
still another level of appeals left. Other cases, including one for
corruption, are pending. Berlusconi said he would be exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he has detached himself from his business empire
and let his son and daughter run it since 1994, when he was
premier.
</P>
<P>
   His alliance did well in Sunday's regional elections in part
thanks to a campaign marriage with Umberto Bossi, a volatile
regional leader known for harsh anti-immigrant pronouncements. But
Berlusconi said regulated, legal immigration would be good for
Italy, which has a low birth rate.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Reunite Elian, His Dad  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said a court ruling has
stripped Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives of all arguments against
transferring temporary custody of the boy to his father. ''That is
the law,'' Clinton said amid reports that the government was
preparing to forcibly take the 6-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton commented Thursday, a day after a three-judge panel of
the federal appeals court in Atlanta said Elian must remain in the
United States until the court decides whether he should get an
asylum hearing. A hearing was set for May 11.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was viewed by the Miami relatives and their allies as
a victory, but Clinton said it reinforced the administration's case
for Elian to be reunited with his father.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reported in today's editions that Attorney
General Janet Reno has decided to remove Elian from his
great-uncle's home in Miami and has instructed federal law
enforcement officials to determine the best time to do so. The
report quoted unidentified government officials as saying they
expected to move by the middle of next week.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the report, Justice Department spokeswoman Carole
Florman said Reno remained open to a voluntary settlement, but
declined to discuss whether she has made any decision about
forcibly removing the boy. She said, ''For obvious reasons, we've
always said we wouldn't discuss a law enforcement action in
advance.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times, quoting government officials it did not
name, said in today's editions that law enforcement action was now
all but certain and would be carried out by immigration agents and
federal marshals who have been quietly arriving in Miami in recent
days.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, making his strongest statement to date on the case,
said he knew of ''no conceivable argument'' against the custody
transfer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he (the father) should be reunited with his son,'' the
president said. ''That is the law. And the main argument of the
family in Miami for not doing so has now been removed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their main argument was if we let him go back to his father
before the court rules, he might go back to Cuba. The court has now
said he shouldn't go back to Cuba. The Justice Department agrees
with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton generally has been standing back and leaving the
decisions in the Elian case to Reno, who last week ordered the
Miami relatives to turn over the boy. The family refused.
</P>
<P>
   ''The attorney general is leading the effort,'' presidential
spokesman Joe Lockhart said Thursday. ''The president has been
briefed and has had input. Is she making the decisions here? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than two hours before Clinton spoke, Elian's father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, asked Americans to write to Clinton and Reno,
urging them to act decisively to end the five-month father-son
separation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't let them continue to abuse my son,'' the elder Gonzalez
said, referring to the Miami relatives who have been caring for
Elian since he was found clinging to an inner tube off the Florida
coast on Thanksgiving Day. Elian and two others survived, but his
mother and 10 others fleeing Cuba drowned when their boat sank.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was promised that I was going to be reunited with my son,''
he said, speaking in Spanish near his temporary home in suburban
Maryland. ''Two weeks have gone by and it hasn't happened. I have
always understood, I have always thought, that the United States is
a country which abided by its laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking through a translator, he asked Americans ''to send
message and write to the president ... to the attorney general of
this country so they should act immediately (to) reunite me with my
son,'' he said, speaking through a translator.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday evening, Elian spoke on a cordless telephone in the
yard outside his Miami relatives' home and blew kisses into the
phone. Family spokesman Armando Gutierrez said the boy was talking
to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez offered to bring the boy to
a meeting with his father after being assured by the court ruling
that the boy could stay in the country, an attorney for the family,
Linda Osberg-Braun, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the Miami relatives had said they would meet the
father only if it was without the boy. Juan Miguel's lawyer,
Gregory Craig, said Thursday discussions between his client and
other family members can take place only after the father regains
custody of Elian.
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Lee, N.J., Vice President Al Gore urged Elian's feuding
relatives to get together ''without government officials or
lawyers'' to try to end the impasse. Earlier he had split with the
administration by supporting permanent resident status for Elian,
his father and other relatives in Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Jackson: Kill Flag Compromise  </HEADLINE>
By JIM DAVENPORT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- The Rev. Jesse Jackson has joined efforts
to kill a bill that would remove the Confederate flag from atop the
Statehouse dome but allow it to fly at a monument to Confederate
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and his Rainbow/PUSH Coalition on Thursday backed the
NAACP's opposition to the Senate-approved compromise legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
forced the flag debate when it started a tourism and business
boycott of the state. The organization has said that proposal won't
work because the flag shouldn't fly on the Statehouse grounds or in
any other position of sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   ''That flag should be in the museum as a relic of the nation's
past,'' said Jackson, a Greenville native. ''The vanquished have no
right to fly the flag. One could not fly a Nazi flag over the
capitol in Germany or fly it on the grounds of the Statehouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's remarks came in a telephone interview after a state
representative of his Rainbow/PUSH Coalition spoke in Columbia with
other flag opponents.
</P>
<P>
   His support for the NAACP's position came as House leaders
prepared for debate on the Senate compromise plan that passed a
Judiciary subcommittee Wednesday. With 123 House members, the bill
would need 62 votes to pass. The House Judiciary Committee is
expected to approve the bill on Tuesday, and it could reach the
floor of the Republican-controlled House in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Passing the Senate bill ''is not a done deal,'' said House
Speaker David Wilkins. ''I think it's going to be fairly close.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jim Hodges has said he would support any bill that removes
the Confederate flag from the Statehouse dome.

<HEADLINE> 'Wizard of Oz' Gets Special Exhibit  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A hundred years after its publication, that
very American fantasy -- ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' -- is being
celebrated by the Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   L. Frank Baum opened his fairy tale in a Kansas twister. Among
the principal characters were a scarecrow from a Midwestern
cornfield and a tin woodsman whose mechanisms recall traditional
Yankee ingenuity.
</P>
<P>
   Hero Dorothy insists on how much she loves her Kansas home and
wants to get back to it. The Wizard himself hails from Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   The small ''Oz'' show opening today is part of an elaborate
celebration of the library's own 200th birthday on Monday. Just
twice as old as Dorothy, it's now the world's largest collection of
books -- more than 27 million.
</P>
<P>
   Library officials did not know how many millions of copies of
''Oz'' have been sold or how many translations exist. Known
translations include Arabic, Hebrew, Russian, Polish and even
Latin.
</P>
<P>
   Baum produced his best seller in 1900 and copies went to the
library, as U.S. copyright law requires. A successful musical soon
followed, with a shapely young woman in tights and big hair
replacing little Dorothy. In the original book, she's likely about
10 years old, exhibit director Martha Hopkins said.
</P>
<P>
   A poster advertising the musical appears in the library's
exhibit, along with games, dolls, film clips, costumes and other
memorabilia based on the story.
</P>
<P>
   Many remember Dorothy as a 16-year-old Judy Garland in the 1939
film, where the silver shoes of the book are replaced by the famous
ruby slippers. Hopkins pointed out the line in the original
shooting script that still mentions the silver shoes. She doesn't
know when the change occurred or why.
</P>
<P>
   ''Better for Technicolor,'' she suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Novelist Salman Rushdie, who had a now-abandoned death edict
placed against him by Iranian Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini for his
book ''Satanic Verses,'' said ''Oz'' inspired his first story.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing the film in Bombay when he was 10, he wrote about a
little boy's bizarre adventures, including an encounter with a
talking pianola.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, he wrote a 70-page essay on the book, in which he
reported a pair of ruby slippers found in the MGM Studios basement
sold at a 1970 auction for $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''The Wizard of Oz: An American Fairy Tale'' will be on view
through Sept. 23. Admission is free.

<HEADLINE> IRS Taxpayer Notices To Go Out  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The tax headaches haven't ended yet for
millions of Americans who will get IRS notices in the coming weeks
for taxes due or because they made mistakes. Yet an audit says many
of these notices are repetitious and many involve $5 or less.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the circumstances and manpower used, these notices
can cost the Internal Revenue Service between 42 cents and $14.32
each to prepare and send, according to the General Accounting
Office, the investigative arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   A GAO audit found that about 39 percent of the 14.8 million
taxpayers who got IRS collection notices between January and
November 1999 received multiple notices for the same tax
assessment.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these taxpayers got extra notices because they hadn't
paid their taxes, penalties and interest in full on time. But
270,000 received them even after they had paid up, often because
the IRS failed to record the payment in time to stop another notice
from going out.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the IRS also sent out 31 million notices telling
taxpayers about mistakes in returns, such as math errors, and
adjustments made to their accounts. According to a second GAO
audit, 1.5 million of those involved net amounts due of less than
$5 or refunds of less than $1.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS says it is working to improve its communications with
taxpayers -- a long-standing source of complaints -- and legislation
passed by the House is aimed at exploring ways to use technology,
such as e-mail, to speed things up.
</P>
<P>
   In letters to the GAO, IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti said
the report on multiple notices ''mirrors our concerns for
minimizing the burdens placed on taxpayers and the costs of sending
unnecessary notices to them.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of its long-term modernization effort, Rossotti said the
IRS is developing an updated computer system to improve how it
deals with receipt of payments.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are committed to sending clear and concise notices to
taxpayers detailing what is expected of them, while ensuring
accuracy,'' Rossotti said.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the notices for errors involving low-dollar amounts,
Rossotti noted that the law requires the IRS to inform taxpayers of
any change to their account. In addition, the GAO pointed out that
some of these notices initially involve larger amounts, such as a
return claiming a refund of $300 that is adjusted because of an
error to $4 in taxes owed.
</P>
<P>
   ''There would be times when sending a small-dollar notice is
appropriate,'' Rossotti said. ''If a taxpayer is expecting a refund
but ultimately has a small balance due, we would certainly want to
notify him or her of the reason.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of April, Rossotti said the IRS will make changes in
the error notices that could involve:
</P>
<P>
   --Adding clear language pointing out when a notice is not a bill
or request for payment.
</P>
<P>
   --Asking Congress to change the law requiring that taxpayers be
notified of all adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   --Changing computer programs so that small-dollar payments due
are simply recorded as zero balances, with a notice send to
taxpayers explaining the change.
</P>
<P>
   House-passed legislation that would enact a number of new
taxpayer rights would require that the Treasury Department report
within 18 months whether use of e-mail and faxes could improve IRS
communication with taxpayers. That bill is pending in the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Testimony in Peeler case to begin May 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- A judge has set May 2 as the day
testimony will begin in the trial of Russell Peeler Jr. who is
charged with murder in the shooting deaths of an 8-year-old boy and
his mother.
</P>
<P>
   But before that happens, Superior Court Judge G. Sarsfield Ford
said he will issue a written ruling on a defense motion to dismiss
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Peeler Jr., 28, faces the possibility of the death
penalty in the Jan. 7, 1999, slayings of Leroy ''B.J.'' Brown Jr.
and his mother, Karen Clarke.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say Peeler masterminded the killings to prevent the
boy from testifying against him in an earlier murder case. Peeler's
brother, Adrian, 25, is also charged in the murders, accused of
gunning down mother and son in their Bridgeport home.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Peeler's lawyers have asked that the charges be
dismissed because the state's key witness appears to have recanted
at least some of what she originally told police.
</P>
<P>
   In statements to police and in a videotaped deposition she gave
in November, Josephine Lee said she acted as a lookout and
witnessed the murders. But in December, she wrote a letter to her
lawyer, claiming she lied. At the same time, Lee wrote three
separate letters to Bridgeport police officers in which she
apologized for her role in the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has not said if he plans to deny the motion, but instructed
his court officer, Thomas St. John, to notify the 12 jurors and six
alternates to be in court at 10 a.m. May 2.
</P>
<P>
   Ford did deny a separate motion by the state Thursday to have
opening arguments in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   State's Attorney Jonathan Benedict contended that an opening
argument to the jury might help them understand what may be a
complicated case.
</P>
<P>
   Such arguments are very rarely done in state criminal trials and
Ford told Benedict, ''I think you have selected fair-minded people
who are capable of following the trail of the case.''

Thursday, the precise moment two teen-agers opened fire in Columbine High School
on April 20, 1999. At private ceremonies and public remembrances all day and

mark the first anniversary of the nation's deadliest school shooting. Gov. Bill

U.S. Army officers, executed more than 2,000 political prisoners without trial
in the early weeks of the Korean War. Supreme commander Gen. Douglas MacArthur
became aware of at least one of the mass shootings, according to documents
originally classified "top secret." The new information, detailed in reporting
by The Associated Press and a Korean researcher, substantiates what some

<HEADLINE> Deaf Sue Movie Giants Over Captions  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Aaron Fudenske wants to see a movie on
the big screen, he almost always catches a foreign film with
subtitles or a high action picture.
</P>
<P>
   For Fudenske, who has been deaf since birth, that's the only way
to ensure he'll follow what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very frustrating not to equally enjoy movies'' with
others, said Fudenske, a program analyst at the Transportation
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to make movie theaters more accessible, Fudenske and two
other deaf individuals on Thursday filed suit against Loews
Cineplex Entertainment Corp. and AMC Entertainment, contending the
companies violated federal disabilities law by failing to provide
captioning.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of
Columbia, argues that theaters are a place of ''public
accommodation'' as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act
and therefore should ensure that deaf people are not denied service
due to their disability.
</P>
<P>
   ''We simply cannot enjoy movies without the proper
accessibility,'' said another plaintiff, Washington lawyer John
Stanton.
</P>
<P>
   The companies named in the lawsuit say they already offer some
showings of movies using a system called ''open captioning.'' That
system is similar to movie subtitles without the black background
box. It also uses italics in the corner or icons to describe sounds
and events that a deaf person might miss.
</P>
<P>
   But plaintiffs' lawyer Wayne Cohen said the problem is the
infrequency with which such captioned films are shown in a given
week or month.
</P>
<P>
   ''They'll do an occasional viewing from time to time to try to
sugarcoat the issue,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   The suit wants the theaters to implement captioning at all
screenings within 180 days. There is no monetary request.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the theaters can make movies more accessible to deaf
individuals through a number of means without exorbitant costs or
inconvenience to their hearing audiences.
</P>
<P>
   One system, called ''rear window'' captioning, involves
providing deaf attendees with a plexiglass screen they can stick
into the cup holder or seat in front of them. The screen would show
captions for that individual viewer.
</P>
<P>
   Another system involves scrolling captions on the backs of seats
and a third would call for a separate viewing screen altogether
within the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen estimated that adding such technologies would cost about
$8,000 to $15,000 per theater.
</P>
<P>
   But Marc Pascucci, a spokesman for Loews Cineplex, said that the
rear window captioning system is cost-prohibitive to install and
could become obsolete very soon. In the last two years, the company
has been doing special engagements of films with open captions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are making efforts to reach out to the hearing impaired
community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   AMC spokeswoman Brenda Nolte said the company has been providing
open captions in some of its theaters for nearly three years and
plans to expand the program.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has been well-received,'' AMC spokeswoman Brenda Nolte
said. ''This was the system that we have been advised is the
preference of the hearing impaired community.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Criticizes Census Incentive  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Census Bureau distribution of 30-minute
telephone calling cards to a select group of people to get them to
return their census reports sends a mixed message to the public as
to why they should participate in the count, Republican critics
said.
</P>
<P>
   A randomly selected group of 15,000 households took part in the
program, in which they received a card good for $20 worth of
long-distance telephone calls if they answered the census
questions.
</P>
<P>
   The incentive was part of a number of test programs the bureau
routinely does during census years in preparation for future
counts, Census Bureau spokesman Steve Jost. ''This doesn't mean
this is a final decision on whether we will use these incentives or
not'' in the next census to be taken in 2010.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time an incentive program has been tested by
the bureau as a way to get forms back.
</P>
<P>
   But Chip Walker, an aide to Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., chairman of
the House Government Reform Committee's census panel, said
''education, not compensation, should be what motivates people to
participate in the census.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The census should be a civic ceremony similar to voting,''
Walker said. ''I think if we start going down that road, we may
find ourselves in one, two or three censuses from now trying outbid
a previous census.''
</P>
<P>
   Jost said Census director Kenneth Prewitt personally opposes
incentives, but is willing to test it if it means more people will
respond. If the incentive sticks, it could also cost far less than
paying to send an enumerator to homes that did not mail back their
census forms.
</P>
<P>
   About 35 percent of the forms mailed out have yet to be
returned. Census Bureau workers will be sent to these homes,
beginning April 27, to gather the missing information.
</P>
<P>
   One city, Valdosta, Ga., drew criticism after offering a $5
incentive to people who returned their forms. The Southeastern
Legal Foundation, a conservative public interest law group, said
that incentive may violate Georgia law.

<HEADLINE> White House Ridicules GOP Drug Plan  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is taking aim at a
GOP proposal that would provide private prescription drug coverage
to low-income seniors, saying it would leave many elderly Americans
still struggling to pay for their medicines.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's top economic and health advisers rebutted
the ''sketchy'' GOP plan as inferior to the White House's own
proposal, which would give prescription drug benefits to all
Americans covered under Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ''Republicans need to move from just the talk to walking the
walk,'' Gene Sperling, head of the president's National Economic
Council, said at a White House briefing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP plan, as outlined by House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., calls for private health plans to offer drug benefits and
government subsidies to pay drug costs for low-income seniors.
While many of the details have yet to be worked out, Republicans
said the plan would lower drug prices, give seniors more coverage
choice and help the neediest Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''To us it still seems like a Swiss cheese plan with more holes
than substance,'' Sperling said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the administration was too quick to criticize a
plan that has yet to be finalized.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're prematurely trying to play politics,'' said John
Feehery, Hastert's spokesman. GOP leaders are waiting for a formal
estimate of the plan's costs by the Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once we complete those numbers we will give out more details.
But we believe we have a comprehensive plan for seniors,'' Feehery
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling said the GOP plan to provide subsidies to cover drug
costs for seniors at the poverty level would leave out 6 million
Medicare beneficiaries who have no drug coverage but have incomes
above the poverty line -- which he calculated at about $12,500 a
year for singles and $16,875 per couple.
</P>
<P>
   The White House plan has an estimated cost of $195 billion over
10 years. It would provide drug benefits to all 39 million Medicare
beneficiaries regardless of their income, paying up to $1,000 in
drug costs annually for a $26 monthly premium.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans argue that aid should go to the neediest senior
citizens and say they are opposed to a big government program that
would displace private coverage that many seniors now have through
retirement benefits or HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet known what premiums would be under the GOP plan.
Sperling predicted drug benefits provided by private insurers -- a
cornerstone of the GOP plan -- would probably end up being too
expensive for many Medicare beneficiaries. The coverage would work
much like drug benefits under private supplemental policies such as
Medigap, which charge high premiums that increase as policy holders
age, he said.
</P>
<P>
   This aspect of the Republican plan ''should be particularly a
concern of older women'' because the majority of people over age 85
are women. ''Building a drug program off that model has very
serious concerns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also questioned whether Republicans will commit enough money
to a prescription drug program. GOP lawmakers have set aside $40
billion in their budget proposal for Medicare over the next five
years. Hastert has said most of that would go toward the drug
program but details have not been announced.
</P>
<P>
   Proposed GOP tax cuts of $792 billion over 10 years leave little
room for investments in a drug program unless spending cuts are
made in other programs, Sperling suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their tax cut is filling up so much room that it's very
difficult for them to show how they can have a significant drug
program without either reducing the tax cut or relying on
discretionary cuts that are ... unrealistic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even while they took shots at the GOP plan, administration
officials said they wanted to work with Republicans to come up with
a compromise. They said they've been in discussions with members of
a Senate Finance Committee, which has held a number of hearings on
prescription drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But time is running out -- only five months remain before
lawmakers wrap up the session.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe it can evolve into something that really does
achieve the principles we all share,'' said Chris Jennings,
Clinton's chief health adviser.

<HEADLINE> CDC Reports U.S. Meningitis Cases  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The first U.S. cases in an apparent worldwide
outbreak of a rare strain of meningitis have been reported.
</P>
<P>
   Government health officials said Thursday that at least three
New Yorkers have come down with the type of the disease that's been
linked to this year's Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials warn that anyone else who returned from the
annual pilgrimage last month, or who has had close contact with a
participant, should see a doctor if they suffer meningitis
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Bacterial meningitis is a serious and often deadly infection of
the fluid and membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. It is
spread through coughing, kissing and other close contact.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned all
returning pilgrims and their close contacts to contact a doctor or
go to the nearest emergency room if they experience fever, intense
headache, stiff neck or neck pain, pain when looking at bright
lights, nausea or vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Organization said Thursday it had recorded 250
cases of meningitis linked to the pilgrimage, including 55 deaths.
The reports began about a week ago when Britain and France
diagnosed meningitis in people returned from the pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC now says three people in New York City who either
traveled to Saudi Arabia or had close contacts who did have been
diagnosed with meningitis.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC contacted state health departments Thursday, urging them
to be alert to meningitis symptoms in recent travelers to Saudi
Arabia. The specific strain involved is the rare ''W-135'' strain
of the bacteria Neisseria meningitidis.
</P>
<P>
   About 1.3 million pilgrims traveled to Mecca last month for the
annual pilgrimage, or hajj, which all Muslims are expected to
complete once in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia requires them to produce documents certifying that
they received vaccinations against such contagious diseases such as
meningitis.
</P>
<P>
   Those immunized in the United States most likely received a
vaccine that does include some protection against the W-135 strain
but the vaccine is not perfect and it does not prevent someone who
appears healthy from carrying the germ and spreading it to family
members.

<HEADLINE> LA Times Agrees To Halt Ads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Times is dropping promotional
ads that juxtapose images of Muslim women in long chadors with
those of bikini-clad beachgoers after the city's Islamic community
and the newspaper's employees complained.
</P>
<P>
   The ads were part of a new campaign that attempted to contrast
images of Southern California with world events the newspaper
covers.
</P>
<P>
   They drew criticism not only from Muslims but from more than 200
Times editors and reporters who signed a petition last week
complaining that the ads were offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Other ads in the campaign contrasted an overweight man lying on
a beach with the body of a dead soldier lying in a street, and cars
on a crowded freeway with a column of tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Times spokesman Mike Lange said the beach ad will be replaced by
others previously prepared to run in rotation. He said there are no
plans to pull any of the other ads.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper agreed to withdraw the ad following discussions
with representatives of the Council on American Islamic Relations
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ''We appreciate the Times' willingness to address Muslim
concerns,'' Nihad Awad, the council's executive director, said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Times employees who signed the petition praised the company's
move, but some believed other ads in the series also should have
been withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   By highlighting differences among people, the campaign
contradicted the efforts of many reporters and editors to bring the
city's diverse population together, said reporter Lorenza Munoz.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a start,'' she said of the decision. ''I think the dead
body one is in pretty poor taste, but at least they recognize the
other was not only bad advertising and divisive, but was offensive
as well. The way the ad portrayed the Muslims, it was as if it was
us vs. them.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Take a Dive  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average took a
dive Friday, but traders said the fall was mainly due to technical
reasons. The dollar rose against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The Nikkei index closed at 18,252.68 points, down 706.64 points,
or 3.7 percent, from Thursday. On Thursday, it closed down 127.30
points, or 0.67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar was trading at 105.68 yen at 3 p.m. (2 a.m. EDT)
Friday, up 0.90 yen from 104.78 yen late Thursday but slightly
below its late New York level of 105.73 yen overnight.
</P>
<P>
   On the Tokyo stock market, prices started higher as investors
were cheered by the Dow's 169.09-point rise Thursday, leaving the
New York index at 10,844.05 at the market's close.
</P>
<P>
   But investors later began selling industrial stocks which will
be removed from the Nikkei index's stocks starting April 24.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty of the index's stocks will be replaced to better reflect
changes in Japan's economy, the Nihon Keizai newspaper, a major
Japanese financial daily and the administrator of the index, said
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Removal of stocks from the index tends to lower their prestige
and makes them less attractive to investors.
</P>
<P>
   ''People were selling not only the old components that will
leave the index, they were also selling those that will stay in the
index,'' said Chuck Lambert, market analyst at Jardine Fleming
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section rose, showing that overall market sentiment was not
bad and that much of the selling was technical.
</P>
<P>
   The TOPIX gained 5.12 points, or 0.31 percent, to finish at
1,634.12 points. The index closed up 9.18 points, or 0.56 percent,
the day before.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the plunge in the Nikkei spurred a small
burst of dollar-buying. But traders said the impact on currency
trading of the Nikkei's drop was limited, noting that the TOPIX
held steady.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 99.31 yen, up from
98.30 yen late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond
stood at 1.7300, down from 1.7350 percent Thursday. Its price rose
to 101.46 from 101.42.

<HEADLINE> Threats Close Several Schools  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE GUTTERMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- In Ohio, a seventh-grader was arrested in a bomb
threat against her school. In Virginia, a 15-year-old girl was
arrested for allegedly making death threats against classmates on a
computer. In Wisconsin, an Army bomb squad was called to
investigate a device left in front of a high school.
</P>
<P>
   Many schools around the country canceled classes or tightened
security Thursday because of a rash of threats and rumors tied to
the anniversary of the Columbine High massacre in suburban Denver.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of violence or injuries.
</P>
<P>
   School safety experts said it was natural that threats and hoax
calls would increase on the anniversary of the deadliest school
shooting in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are more likely simply because of the awareness people
have of the Columbine anniversary,'' said Pamela Riley, president
of the Center for the Prevention of School Violence at North
Carolina State University. ''It seems like an anniversary of
something like this is a time to remember by doing something that
is good, but unfortunately, that's not what's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   No threats were made against Columbine or other Jefferson County
high schools, a district spokesman said, but there was plenty of
activity elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Schools ''have all been walking the tightrope all week, trying
to keep their guard up and react to incidents and track down rumors
while at the same time not overreacting and creating the type of
situation they are trying to avoid,'' said Kenneth Trump, president
of National School Safety and Security Services, a consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, Pulaski County High School was closed after a
15-year-old girl was arrested for allegedly making death threats
against her classmates on a Web page she created on a school
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Schools were closed Thursday in Port Edwards, Wis., after a
bomb-like device was found near the front doors of a high school.
An Army bomb squad determined that the device -- a propane tank with
a timer, batteries and wires -- could not have detonated.
</P>
<P>
   In Westerville, Ohio, a 13-year-old girl was arrested in a bomb
threat at Walnut Springs Middle School, where officials sent
students to a neighboring church until the time listed in the
threat had passed. Classes then resumed.

<HEADLINE> New US Magazine Designed for Papers  </HEADLINE>
By VICKI BROWN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A new national magazine hopes to succeed
by filling a void for weekly and small daily newspapers looking for
an affordable, folksier alternative to Parade and USA Weekend.
</P>
<P>
   American Profile, which premieres April 23, targets community
newspaper readers with features about ''the type of people who make
up these communities and make them special,'' says Dan Hammond,
founder and CEO of Nashville-based Publishing Group of America.
</P>
<P>
   ''We recognized that major metro markets have been well served
with a plethora of media, including two well-entrenched Sunday
magazines,'' Hammond said. There was not, however, a weekly
supplement for small publishers, focusing on hometown life, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that niche was smart business, said Samir A. Husni,
a University of Mississippi journalism professor and magazine
industry expert.
</P>
<P>
   ''The magazine is filling a void for weekly and small daily
newspaper publishers with a channel that simply did not previously
exist,'' Husni said.
</P>
<P>
   The four-color magazine debuts with 1.1 million paid subscribers
to more than 250 newspapers, all with circulations under 20,000.
Publishers are free to insert American Profile into their newspaper
any day of the week, rather than just Sunday, like the larger
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Hammond, who came up with the idea 10 years ago, asked
publishers what they wanted in a weekly magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ''They wanted it to feature a hometown each week in each region.
They wanted it to lift up and celebrate people who do extraordinary
things and ask for no recognition,'' Hammond said.
</P>
<P>
   Producing the magazine wasn't feasible until now, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now, we have the ability to go from computer to press and
eliminate many steps that would have been cumbersome and costly. We
can print, drop and ship,'' Hammond said.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers pay about $25 for each 1,000 circulation, plus
shipping, handling and the cost of inserting the magazine, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The cover story for the first issue, ''Home for Good,'' looks at
Americans who are leaving cities for the lure of small town life.
The ''Hometown Spotlight'' feature is on Jonesboro, Ga., the town
where ''Gone With The Wind'' author Margaret Mitchell researched
historical background for her novel.
</P>
<P>
   Each issue has a national feature common to all editions. For
example, the week of July 23 will offer a guide to state fairs,
with a list of dates and entertainers. Recipes and calendar events
will vary by region.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Randolph, publisher of The Harrodsburg Herald, a 6,300
circulation weekly in Harrodsburg, Ky., was the first to contract
for American Profile.
</P>
<P>
   ''They sent a couple of copies and one had a feature on a family
dairy farm,'' said Randolph, who thought the story would appeal to
readers in his town 35 miles south of Lexington, Ky. ''It's about
the common, everyday man.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, there are about 7,000 community newspapers -- weekly
or small daily newspapers with no more than a 30 percent overlap in
circulation with a larger daily.
</P>
<P>
   American Profile's target audience is readers in towns with
85,000 or below populations. Hammond has turned down larger dailies
that want to subscribe in order to keep the magazine's well-defined
market.
</P>
<P>
   The largest circulation newspaper to buy the magazine is The
Daily Sun, in Lady Lake, Fla., a city of 18,000 just outside Ocala.
The smallest has a circulation of about 1,000, he said.

<HEADLINE> Four Killed in Pa. Train Collision  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER NEWTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINKING SPRING, Pa. (AP) -- A man who chased his estranged
girlfriend through town used his car to push hers into the path of
an oncoming freight train after both had stopped at a railroad
crossing, police said, killing her and three others in the car.
</P>
<P>
   The woman made a frantic 911 call on her cellular phone and was
talking to a dispatcher when her car was struck by the train, state
police Cpl. Bruce Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   The man, who fled the scene, was being sought today. The car he
was believed to be driving was found late Thursday in Reading,
about five miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel that we have a good idea who is responsible for this
tragedy, and we're pursuing that person now,'' Edwards said. The
man's identity was not released.
</P>
<P>
   The crash happened about 4:30 p.m. Thursday at a crossing on the
main thoroughfare in Sinking Spring, a town of about 2,400 people
50 miles northwest of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   It followed a half-hour chase in and around town that reached
speeds up to 90 mph, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The fleeing woman, Candace Wertz, 20, of Sinking Spring, went
around a car that was parked at the crossing -- the gates were down
because of the oncoming train -- and then stopped in the oncoming
traffic lane, state police Lt. Ed Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The second vehicle came up behind her and struck her in the
rear. The second vehicle then pushed the first vehicle onto the
tracks,'' Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   The Norfolk Southern freight train was going about 40 mph at the
time of the collision, Edwards said. He said the engineer applied
the brakes but was unable to stop in time, dragging the woman's car
nearly 60 feet before coming to a rest.
</P>
<P>
   Wertz and her 2-year-old son, John Michael Cortez, were
pronounced dead at the scene. Another woman in her 20s and a girl
about 6 years old died after being taken to hospitals. Their names
were not immediately released.
</P>
<P>
   A 14-year-old girl who was at a playground near the crossing
said the two cars slammed on their brakes and stopped before the
second car revved its engine and shoved the first car onto the
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It happened really fast and at first I thought it was an
accident,'' Katie Connors said. ''But I could hear screaming for
just one split second and then the train tried to brake, but it was
too late.''
</P>
<P>
   The train was carrying mixed cargo including lumber, concrete
and syrup, police said.

   TOKYO (AP) -- The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average took a
dive today, but traders said the fall was mainly due to technical
reasons. The dollar was higher against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The Nikkei index closed at 18,252.68 points, down 706.64 points,
or 3.7 percent, from Thursday. On Thursday, it closed down 127.30
points, or 0.67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar was trading at 105.68 yen at 5 p.m. (4 a.m. EDT)
today, up 0.90 yen from 104.78 yen late Thursday but slightly below
its late New York level of 105.73 yen overnight. During the day, it
ranged from 105.58 yen to 105.89 yen.
</P>
<P>
   On the Tokyo stock market, prices started higher as investors
were cheered by a 169.09-point rise Thursday in the Dow Jones
industrial average, leaving the New York index at 10,844.05 at the
market's close.
</P>
<P>
   But Tokyo investors later began selling industrial stocks which
will be removed from the Nikkei index starting April 24.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty of the index's stocks will be replaced to better reflect
changes in Japan's economy, the Nihon Keizai newspaper, a major
Japanese financial daily and the administrator of the index, said
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Removal of stocks from the index tends to lower their prestige
and makes them less attractive to investors.
</P>
<P>
   ''People were selling not only the old components that will
leave the index, they were also selling those that will stay in the
index,'' said Chuck Lambert, market analyst at Jardine Fleming
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section rose, showing that overall market sentiment was not
bad and that much of the selling was technical.
</P>
<P>
   The TOPIX gained 5.12 points, or 0.31 percent, to finish at
1,634.12. The index closed up 9.18 points, or 0.56 percent, the day
before.
</P>
<P>
   Volume on the first section was estimated at a hefty 1.1 billion
shares, up from 692 million shares Thursday. Retreating issues
outnumbered advancers 968 to 306, while 106 issues were unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the plunge in the Nikkei spurred a small
burst of dollar-buying. But traders said the impact of the Nikkei's
drop on currency trading was limited, noting that the TOPIX held
steady.
</P>
<P>
   There was strong demand to buy back the dollar after the
greenback's rise overnight, but other investors started selling the
U.S. currency as it rose, dealers said, leaving it slightly weaker
compared with it's New York levels.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is generally short on dollars. But customers,
particularly investors, are selling,'' said Takeo Suzuki, assistant
foreign exchange manager at Nomura Trust and Banking. ''Investors
seem to be hedging against a stronger yen.''
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 99.16 yen, up from
98.30 yen late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond
stood at 1.7300, down from 1.7350 percent Thursday. Its price rose
to 101.46 from 101.42.

<HEADLINE> Tentative Northwest Air Deal Reached  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAGAN, Minn. (AP) -- Northwest Airlines flight attendants will
decide whether to ratify a tentative five-year contract to end a
bitter 3{-year battle with the nation's fourth-largest carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Ballots will be mailed next week to the airline's 11,000 flight
attendants, who rejected a tentative agreement last August. They
have been seeking a new contract since September 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hallelujah,'' said attendant Dara Manuel at Minneapolis-St.
Paul International Airport when she learned of the tentative pact
reached Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's exciting. It's really exciting. This has been a long,
uphill battle, a long negotiation process. I'm thankful that it's
probably, hopefully, coming to end,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Steeneland, Northwest executive vice president and chief
corporate officer, called the agreement ''a fair one for all
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Teamsters Local 2000 President Billie Davenport said the union
wouldn't release details until its executive board had a chance to
review the pact and send it to members.
</P>
<P>
   But a statement posted on the union's Web site gave the
following details:
</P>
<P>
   --Industry-leading pension rates, increased from $35 to $65 per
month per year of service, nearly an 86 percent improvement.
</P>
<P>
   --Increased base pay with ''date of signing'' increases of 8
percent to 27.7 percent, depending on longevity. Attendants with
the least seniority would get the biggest raises because there is a
wider gap in pay between new hires at Northwest and the rest of the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   --Stronger work rules.
</P>
<P>
   --Full domestic partner health insurance benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, pay for Northwest flight attendants starts at around
$15,000 and rises to more than $40,000, with the average pay in the
mid-$30,000 range.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions have remained high since Northwest sued the union over
an alleged holiday sickout. Northwest fired 18 flight attendants
for calling in sick during the Christmas-New Year's holiday period,
and the union filed grievances. About 300 flights were canceled
over the period.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides had agreed before Thursday that the company's lawsuit
would be dropped if the flight attendants ratified a tentative
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendants took pay cuts for three years beginning in
1993 to help keep Northwest out of bankruptcy, and until early this
year wages were only 3 percent higher than before the cuts.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Northwest gave flight attendants a 4 percent raise,
just a day after giving its mechanics, custodians and cleaners the
same pay increase.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest pilots went on a 15-day strike in 1998 that crippled
the airline for weeks and cost the company millions in lost
profits.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani Wife Joining 'Vagina' Play  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Actress and television personality Donna
Hanover, the wife of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, is joining the cast of
the off-Broadway hit ''The Vagina Monologues'' next month.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning May 30, Hanover will take over a lead role in the play
written by Eve Ensler, a personal friend and political supporter of
Hillary Rodham Clinton, Giuliani's opponent in the U.S. Senate
race.
</P>
<P>
   Joannie Danielides, Hanover's spokeswoman, confirmed the
casting. Calls seeking comment from the mayor's office were not
immediately returned early today.
</P>
<P>
   Hanover will perform in the stage show for two weeks, sharing
the play's dozen or so monologues with two other women.
</P>
<P>
   The monologues are constructed from interviews Ensler held with
women on topics including orgasm, uncomfortable pelvic exams,
sexual abuse, sexual fantasies and childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   Ensler had been performing all of the monologues herself until
February, when the she began sharing the lead with rotating trios
of performers, including Broadway performers such as Audra McDonald
and singer Alanis Morissette.
</P>
<P>
   Hanover has appeared on the big screen in films including ''The
People vs. Larry Flynt'' and ''Light it Up,'' and on TV in soap
operas such as ''One Life to Live'' and ''All My Children.'' She
also is the host of a program on the Food Network.

<HEADLINE> Sheriff Backs Columbine Rescuers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- The county sheriff is defending his
deputies as heroes in the wake of nine new lawsuits accusing the
department of mishandling the response and not doing enough to
prevent last year's Columbine High School shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't do anything wrong,'' Jefferson County Sheriff John
Stone said. ''We have people who did some pretty heroic things that
are now getting kicked in the face for rescuing people, for saving
people's lives -- because of greed.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone spoke Thursday, the one-year anniversary of the day when
two teen-age gunmen opened fire on the Littleton school, killing 12
students and a teacher before committing suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The new lawsuits were filed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In one lawsuit, the parents of slain student Daniel Rohrbough
allege he was killed by a bullet fired by a deputy. Authorities
have said no evidence exists that Rohrbough died from friendly
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawsuits contends a police sharpshooter was refused
permission to shoot one of the gunmen through a library window;
investigators did not investigate complaints of hate-filled
rhetoric on a Web page maintained by one of the killers; and
authorities disregarded pleas for help from students trying to save
teacher Dave Sanders, who later died.
</P>
<P>
   Stone said his department will be vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just want this thing at some point to be put to rest,'' he
said, ''to let this community heal.''

<HEADLINE> Two Tennessee Men Accused of Fraud  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Two Tennessee men have been indicted on federal
charges for allegedly buying nearly $750,000 worth of diamonds and
Rolex watches using credit card numbers stolen from some of the
nation's top executives.
</P>
<P>
   James Rinaldo Jackson, 39, and Dereck Cunningham, 28, both of
Memphis, were charged in U.S. District Court in Manhattan with
participating in a scheme to use the stolen information to buy
merchandise throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   The charges were announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in December, the men allegedly obtained about 20
diamonds, including at least two in excess of five carats and at
least two in excess of four carats. One diamond was valued at more
than $54,000.
</P>
<P>
   Among victims of the fraud were the chief operating officer of
Coca-Cola Enterprises, the chief executive officer of Hilton Hotels
and the chairman and chief executive officer of Lehman Brothers
Holdings, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Other victims included the estates of deceased executives,
including a former chairman and chief executive officer of Wendy's
International and a former administrator of Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment alleged that Jackson and Cunningham purposefully
identified prominent members of the nation's business community as
targets of their scheme and then stole critical personal
information about them.
</P>
<P>
   The men impersonated their victims in telephone calls to banks
and credit card companies, convincing them to change the billing
addresses on the accounts to hotels in Tennessee, Arkansas and
Mississippi, where they later had the goods shipped, prosecutors
said.
</P>
<P>
   To complete the scheme, Jackson made reservations at the hotels
in the names of his victims and notified the hotels to expect
packages to be delivered to the individuals, the government
alleged.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was arrested by FBI agents in Memphis who watched him
try to pick up a package addressed to one of his victims at a
Memphis-area hotel, prosecutors said. Jackson was being held
without bail pending further court proceedings in New York. His
lawyer did not immediately return a phone message for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham has not yet been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Jackson and Cunningham each face maximum sentences
of 30 years in prison and $1 million fines.

<HEADLINE> Ralph Nader Campaigns in Kentucky  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE BAILEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- A longtime advocate for the ''little guy''
with his focus on the perceived evils of corporate America, Ralph
Nader now has other targets in sight: the Republican and Democratic
parties as he runs for president under the Green Party banner.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some people like to take on big guys,'' Nader said with a
smirk as he spoke to several hundred supporters Thursday at the
University of Kentucky's Singletary Center for the Arts. ''I like
to take on big guys. Big guys invigorate me. And they should
invigorate you.''
</P>
<P>
   His message was simple: Corporations and their lobbyists have
taken over the political system and it is up to citizens to return
the process to its grass-roots origin.
</P>
<P>
   ''You hear so many people today say, 'I'm not into politics,'''
he said. ''Students, if you don't turn on to politics, politics is
going to turn on you. That's a lesson you may learn the hard way.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader, 66, ran for president in 1996, but appeared on fewer than
one-fourth of state ballots. He did not campaign or raise money and
attracted less than 1 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Nader's goal is to get the party on the ballot
in every state and pull more than 5 percent of the vote, which
would qualify him for millions in federal campaign funds. He
currently polls in single digits, along with Reform Party
presidential candidate Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party currently is on the ballot in 13 states,
including New York and California.
</P>
<P>
   Nader promised to wage ''a campaign in every sense of the
word.''
</P>
<P>
   He is up against a handful of challengers for the Green Party
nomination, including Jello Biafra, former lead singer of the punk
rock band the Dead Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Princeton and Harvard, Nader is a lawyer and
author who has fought to bring progress and reform in the areas of
auto safety, worker rights and environmental preservation. In the
late 1960s, he organized citizen action teams around the country
known as ''Nader's Raiders.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader said his platform will revolve around several issues,
including creating a universal health care system and destroying
corporate America's hold on Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''The two-party system is crumbling. (Ross) Perot started that
crumble,'' he said. ''They are hollowed out and don't have much
basic grass-roots support. They're basically two parties with a lot
of money fighting against each other with 30-second electric combat
ads on television.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only way we are going to regain control of our political
institution is to help build a progressive political movement that
will break up the concentration of wealth and power -- a plutocracy
that reigns over our democracy,'' he added.

<HEADLINE> NYC Protesters Denounce Mayor  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- More than 2,000 people marched from Brooklyn to
City Hall demanding Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's resignation over his
handling of fatal police shootings of unarmed black men.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters on the three-mile march also vowed to make sure
Giuliani doesn't win his bid for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''You all have got to vote!'' shouted Marie Dorismond, whose
brother, Patrick, was killed by police outside a Manhattan bar.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of this will mean nothing if you don't vote. One vote will
make one big difference. I'm tired of crying for black brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   The mostly Haitian-American crowd specifically chanted the names
of Amadou Diallo, Dorismond and Malcolm Ferguson, punctuating their
cries with: ''Giuliani must go!''
</P>
<P>
   Diallo was shot to death in 1999 by four white police officers,
who were acquitted of all charges. Ferguson, who was fatally shot
during an undercover drug raid, and Dorismond were killed this
year.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, Giuliani has vociferously defended the police. He
sometimes sought to shift blame for the shootings to the victims
and was criticized for releasing Dorismond's sealed juvenile
criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's office did not return a telephone call for comment on
the rally but said earlier in the day: ''People have a right to
protest, I really have no problem with that at all as long as they
do it peacefully.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no mention by speakers at the rally that if Giuliani
loses the Senate race in November to Democrat Hillary Rodham
Clinton, he will remain mayor until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters voiced anger toward the NYPD as well, but their
real focus was Giuliani, and sign after sign depicted the mayor as
the devil or as Adolf Hitler. The signs were cheered by about
hundred onlookers as the marchers came off the Brooklyn Bridge into
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Giuliani violates human rights,'' ''Giuliani, the new
Hitler,'' and ''Stop and frisk Giuliani, book him up for racism,''
read some of the signs.
</P>
<P>
   One person was arrested during the protest, but he was later
released and the arrest voided.

   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) -- Six West African nations have signed an
agreement to share a common currency within three years.
</P>
<P>
   The countries that signed Thursday's agreement are Ghana,
Nigeria, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Gambia and Guinea.
</P>
<P>
   The joint declaration came at a summit of leaders of the West
African economic community.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have taken a giant leap forward. We are doing what we
should have done some time back but ... better late than never,''
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo said.
</P>
<P>
   The signatories pledged to immediately create a regional central
bank and reduce annual inflation to five percent by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration also suggests a possible monetary union with
eight other West African countries that already share a
French-backed currency, the CFA franc.
</P>
<P>
   Those nations are Ivory Coast, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Mali,
Niger, Togo, Benin and Guinea-Bissau.

the CFA franc which is linked to, but separate from, the West

   ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- Flowers, a stuffed Easter bunny and a
plastic duck now mark the site where an 8-year-old boy was stabbed
to death in an apparent random attack that has police and residents
baffled.
</P>
<P>
   Officers fanned through the neighborhood Thursday, questioning
residents, reviewing surveillance tapes from businesses and passing
out fliers, hoping to find information that may lead them to
whomever killed Kevin Shifflett.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was slain Wednesday as he played with other children in
front of his great-grandmother's home. Police said the attacker
casually walked up behind the boy and began stabbing him.
</P>
<P>
   ''This can unsettle a community for a long time, and we have to
make something happen quickly,'' Deputy Police Chief David Baker
told The Washington Post. ''We're really concerned about the
community and we know they're scared. We, too, are stricken by the
senselessness of it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first homicide of the year in the city of 120,000
near Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's 80-year-old great-grandmother and a 51-year-old woman
passer-by who came to the boy's aid were also wounded. The
passer-by was hospitalized today in fair condition. The
great-grandmother had cuts to her hand and arms.
</P>
<P>
   The man fled after the attack, and police said there was no
apparent motive. No weapon was recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ''I miss him so much,'' said the boy's father, Arthur Shifflett.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's parents both work for the city -- the father in the
maintenance department and the mother in the finance division. The
attack had workers at City Hall ''walking around in shock,'' Mayor
Kerry Donley said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their co-workers are taking this pretty hard. It has cast a
pall over City Hall,'' the mayor said.

<HEADLINE> Credit-Lyonnais May Be Disciplined  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese regulators recommended disciplinary action
Friday against the Tokyo branch of Credit Lyonnais Securities
Europe-Swiss AG, accusing the company of violations involving
customer accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission submitted
the recommendation to Japan's Financial Reconstruction Commission,
alleging that the brokerage firm violated the law in three separate
incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the company's office in Tokyo could not be reached
after office hours Friday for comment on the decision. The
company's media office in Paris had already closed until Tuesday
for the Easter holiday as well.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling, the SESC said that Credit Lyonnais Securities
illegally provided around $6,040 in property gains on Feb. 1 to
artificially boost a customer's profits.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also said the brokerage solicited a customer in
January 1998 for a securities index futures transaction by
promising profits and saying that it would cover any loss from the
brokerage firm's own accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The third incident occurred in September 1998 when the
commission said the firm falsified reports sent to a customer over
a stock options transaction.

<HEADLINE> Poland To Probe Financial Leak  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Acting on the request of Poland's central
bank, prosecutors launched an investigation Friday into a report
that a decision to raise key interest rates in February was leaked
to some investors.
</P>
<P>
   Julita Sobczak, spokeswoman for Warsaw prosecutors, said the
course of the investigation would be kept secret ''because of the
nature of the information and its importance for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bank officials said earlier this month that their decision to
raise key interest rates Feb. 23 had been leaked a few hours in
advance and had called for an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Despite rising inflation, most analysts had not expected the
move because of a boost in key rates in November.
</P>
<P>
   Poland's largest daily newspaper, Gazeta Wyborcza, has reported
that one investment bank made big deals in Polish currency just
hours before the decision was announced at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Exclusive advance knowledge of rate increases, which effectively
raise the cost of borrowing throughout the economy, could allow
currency traders to reap big profits at the expense of others who
don't expect rate changes.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Plunge, Others Closed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian markets were idle Friday for Easter
holidays but in Tokyo the key stock index plunged on technical
factors.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average tumbled
706.64 points, or 3.7 percent, to 18,252.68. On Thursday, it closed
down 127.30 points, or 0.67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Nikkei opened higher, boosted by a rally overnight on Wall
Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 169.09, or 1.6
percent, to close at 10,844.05.
</P>
<P>
   But Tokyo investors later began selling industrial stocks which
will be removed from the Nikkei index starting April 24.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty of the index's stocks will be replaced to better reflect
changes in Japan's economy, the Nihon Keizai newspaper, a major
Japanese financial daily and the administrator of the index, said
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Removal of stocks from the index tends to lower their prestige
and makes them less attractive to investors.
</P>
<P>
   In currency trading, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 105.68 yen,
up 0.90 yen from 104.78 yen late Thursday but slightly below its
late New York level of 105.73 yen overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Thai shares closed higher in thin trading. The Stock Exchange of
Thailand's Composite Index rose 5.58 points, or 1.4 percent, to
close at 395.06.
</P>
<P>
   Share prices in Taiwan ended slightly higher for the second
straight session in response to overnight gains in U.S. stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Taipei market's Weighted Stock Price Index gained 8.59
points, or 0.09 percent, to 9,117.64.
</P>
<P>
   In Seoul, the Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 5.91
points, or 0.7 percent, to 767.16.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysian shares closed mixed amid continuing investor caution
about the future direction of U.S. markets. The Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange's Composite Index gained 3.71 points, or 0.41 percent, to
898.98.
</P>
<P>
   Markets were closed in Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, the
Philippines, Singapore, and Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Bush Seeking McCain Supporters  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush is looking outside his Texas
circle for advice from supporters of his father and Sen. John
McCain in response to talk that his White House bid is directed by
aides untested by national politics.
</P>
<P>
   A senior adviser to the Texas governor said, however, that
Bush's presidential campaign would remain Austin-based, steered by
top aides Karl Rove, Karen Hughes and Joe Allbaugh.
</P>
<P>
   As he has in the past, Bush will seek advice from senior party
members, the official said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is reaching out to more than two-dozen volunteers,
including three key members of McCain's failed bid for the GOP
nomination: campaign manager Rick Davis and Republican veterans
Kenneth Duberstein and Vin Weber.
</P>
<P>
   The group also includes Mary Matalin, deputy manager of Bush's
father's 1992 campaign; Charles Black, who advised the White House
bids of Bob Dole and Phil Gramm; former Republican National
Committee Chairman Haley Barbour; former Rep. Bill Paxon of New
York and Ed Gillespie, former adviser to House Majority Leader Dick
Armey of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The officials will be charged with funneling suggestions and
information back to Austin, the official said. They will head
working groups that will focus on matters ranging from Vice
President Al Gore's vulnerabilities to the GOP convention.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has sought help from many of these advisers before. In a
Feb. 10 conference call that included Barbour and Black, for
example, Allbaugh sought advice and tried to calm the jitters of
Republican Party members who had grown concerned about McCain's
surge in the GOP primaries.
</P>
<P>
   McCain dropped out of the Republican race after Bush trounced
him on Super Tuesday, but the Texas governor still has been
buffeted by criticism that his Texas advisers are inexperienced.
</P>
<P>
   Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich went public with the
criticism this week, saying Bush's team ''still has a little bit of
Austin in their style'' and is ''not quite up to speed yet'' in
running a national campaign.

<HEADLINE> Alaskan Senate OKs Cruise Ship Tax  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL QUEARY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- The Alaska Senate has approved a bill that
would require cruise ships to pay a $50 tax on each passenger they
bring into Alaska waters.
</P>
<P>
   The measure passed 14-6 Thursday, a day after it surfaced in a
late- night Senate committee hearing amid wrangling over how to
regulate the cruise industry. It now goes to the House, where its
future is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Rick Halford, a Republican, argued that the profitable and
mostly foreign-owned cruise ships pay little to operate in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is all of Alaska for $50,'' he said. ''They are selling
Alaska and we are giving them Alaska to sell.''
</P>
<P>
   But other senators cited concerns about the bill's fairness and
the possible impact on tourism.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the tax-and-spenders put this together, why weren't the
airline passengers, ferry passengers and recreation vehicle drivers
considered?'' remarked Senate Majority Leader Jerry Mackie, also a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The tax would bring in more than $30 million from the more than
600,000 cruise ship passengers who visit the state each year.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise ship industry has opposed smaller head taxes such as
the $5 fee approved by Juneau voters last fall. Industry officials
contend cruise ships already pay their way through port fees and
sales taxes paid by passengers in various communities.
</P>
<P>
   The head tax was drafted by the Senate Finance Committee late
Wednesday, grafting it onto legislation requiring regular
disclosures from cruise ships about what they release into Alaska
waters.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would displace local taxes such as Juneau's, but $5
would be kicked back to the local government in each port town a
passenger visited. That would funnel money to small ports that have
hesitated to impose taxes out of fear the ships would bypass them
as punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The money the state gets from the tax would be earmarked for the
operation of state-owned ports and harbors.
</P>
<P>
   The measure emerged after Republican Senate President Drue
Pearce accused cruise industry lobbyists of killing her bill to
bring cruise ships and other large vessels under the state's oil
spill response laws. Though still alive, Pearce's bill is stalled
in the House.

<HEADLINE> Coast Guard Defends Collision  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEAH BAY, Wash. (AP) -- Coast Guard officials today defended the
crew of a 21-foot inflatable patrol boat that ran over a jet skier
who was trying to disrupt a whale hunt by the Makah tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Erin Abbott, 23, an anti-whaling protester from Seattle, was
listed as stable at a Port Angeles hospital with a shoulder injury
after the collision Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''They ran over me,'' she said from the hospital. ''I wasn't
expecting to get run over by a boat. I expected to try and protect
a whale that's trying to migrate to its summer resting spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard Adm. Paul Blayney said on ABC's ''Good Morning
America'' today that the crew couldn't avoid hitting Abbott.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a dynamic, dangerous situation,'' he said. ''Our people
moved quickly, and unfortunately a boat can't stop on a dime. ...
We regret that there were injuries, but it was moving fast. The
protesters triggered that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The hunt was unsuccessful, but tribal members said they would
not be deterred by protesters, who are required to stay 500 yards
from the whalers and their carved wooden canoe.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope she's OK, but it's unfortunate that she would violate
the exclusionary zone'' around the canoe, said Makah Whaling
Commission Chairman Keith Johnson. ''She'll have to accept the
consequences of her actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Television video showed Abbott swooping in on her watercraft
Thursday as the canoe closed in on a gray whale. The Makah had just
thrown a harpoon, which did not stick in the whale.
</P>
<P>
   As the Makah attempted to maneuver for another shot, Abbott
rushed by the canoe, spraying those aboard with her wake. As the
watercraft turned, it was overtaken by the Coast Guard boat.
</P>
<P>
   The two collided, and both the watercraft and Abbott appeared to
go under the Coast Guard boat. Abbott surfaced a moment later about
20 feet from her watercraft.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't believe she wasn't killed,'' said Julie Woodyer of
World Whale Police. ''This aggressive behavior by the Coast Guard
is unprecedented -- this is our worst nightmare come true.''
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard officials said a second protester, Erin O'Connell,
was arrested Thursday morning and a second personal watercraft was
confiscated. Protesters said they would resort to using larger
boats to interfere with the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal leaders say the seasonal hunt, a centuries-old tradition
that resumed in the fall of 1998 after a 70-year hiatus, is vital
to preserving the identity of the tribe at the tip of Washington's
Olympic Peninsula. Anti-whaling activists fear it could open the
door to a worldwide renewal of commercial whaling.

<HEADLINE> Police: Man Chased Woman Into Train  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER NEWTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINKING SPRING, Pa. (AP) -- A man who chased his estranged
girlfriend through town used his car to push hers into the path of
an oncoming freight train after both had stopped at a railroad
crossing, police said. She and three others in the car were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Candace Wertz made a frantic 911 call on her cellular phone and
was talking to a dispatcher when her car was struck by the train,
state police Cpl. Bruce Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   The man, who fled, was being sought today. The car he was
believed to be driving was found late Thursday in Reading, about
five miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel that we have a good idea who is responsible for this
tragedy, and we're pursuing that person now,'' Edwards said. The
man's identity was not released.
</P>
<P>
   State police today were interviewing friends and relatives of
Wertz and the other woman who was killed. Police say they also
expect to talk to friends of Wertz's estranged boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Wertz said that her sister-in-law had planned to move to
another town because her boyfriend was physically and verbally
abusive.
</P>
<P>
   ''She just couldn't get away from him,'' she said. ''I hope they
find this man. No one should get away with something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The crash happened about 4:30 p.m. Thursday at a crossing on the
main thoroughfare in Sinking Spring, a town of about 2,400 people
50 miles northwest of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   It followed a half-hour chase in and around town that reached
speeds up to 90 mph, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Wertz, 20, of Sinking Spring, went around a car that was parked
at the crossing -- the gates were down because of the oncoming train
-- and then stopped in the oncoming traffic lane, state police Lt.
Ed Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The second vehicle came up behind her and struck her in the
rear. The second vehicle then pushed the first vehicle onto the
tracks,'' Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   The Norfolk Southern freight train was going about 40 mph at the
time of the collision, Edwards said. He said the engineer applied
the brakes but was unable to stop in time, dragging the woman's car
nearly 60 feet before coming to a rest.
</P>
<P>
   Wertz and her 2-year-old son, John Michael Cortez, were
pronounced dead at the scene. Another woman in her 20s and a girl
about 6 years old died after being taken to hospitals. Their names
were not immediately released.
</P>
<P>
   A 14-year-old girl who was at a playground near the crossing
said the two cars slammed on their brakes and stopped before the
second car revved its engine and shoved the first car onto the
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It happened really fast and at first I thought it was an
accident,'' Katie Connors said. ''But I could hear screaming for
just one split second and then the train tried to brake, but it was
too late.''
</P>
<P>
   The train was carrying mixed cargo including lumber, concrete
and syrup, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Wertz's cousin Scott Wertz: ''Everybody is more or less in
shock, and no one knows what happened. She was a good person and
she must have gotten into some kind of bad situation.''

<HEADLINE> Christian Music Awards Presented  </HEADLINE>
By JIM PATTERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Longtime Dove Awards favorite Steven
Curtis Chapman dominated again on Thursday, winning six awards for
Christian music including the top honor of best artist.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman, 37, has won 44 Dove Awards, more than any other
performer. He has won for best artist five previous times.
</P>
<P>
   He brought his wife and three children on stage to share the
best artist award, and introduced a new fourth child -- 7-month-old
daughter Shaohannah Hope, whom he recently adopted in China.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to dedicate this tonight to the little boys and girls
around the world who don't have a mom and dad to teach them how to
live the life they've been given,'' Chapman said. ''We wanted to
come out tonight and celebrate Shaohannah, and celebrate
adoption.''
</P>
<P>
   Chapman also won best male vocalist, best pop-contemporary album
for ''Speechless'' and best pop-contemporary single for ''Dive.''
He won two awards apiece in the single and album categories,
because he produced as well as performed on them.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's best artist Michael W. Smith won best song for
''This is Your Time,'' a song inspired by the Columbine High School
shootings. He performed it during the awards show, which took place
exactly a year after the tragedy in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis Rams quarterback Kurt Warner presented the best song
award to Smith along with Tennessee Titans coach Jeff Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I'll let you handle this trophy. I got the last one,''
Warner said to Fisher, referring to the Rams victory over the
Titans in this year's Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In other major categories, Sixpence None the Richer was named
best group, Jaci Velasquez won her second straight best female
vocalist award, and Ginny Owens won best new artist.
</P>
<P>
   ''What a strange thing it is to be rewarded for a gift that only
God could have given,'' Owens said.
</P>
<P>
   Country star Glen Campbell was awarded best country album for
''A Glen Campbell Christmas.'' George Jones won a Dove for best
country recorded song for ''Angel Band,'' his duet with Vestal
Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   Kathie Lee Gifford, the awards show's hostess, performed a duet
with Dolly Parton, ''Only My Pillow Knows,'' and said she hoped the
show would ''remind people of the incredible diversity that make up
gospel music in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ''The message hasn't changed, but the music certainly has,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Awards were passed out in 43 categories at the Grand Ole Opry
House, seven during the television show scheduled to air in more
than 100 markets over the next week. Dove Award winners are
nominated and selected by 5,500 members of the Gospel Music
Association, which was founded in 1964 to promote Christian music.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Won't Appeal Insurance Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The state Department of Commerce and
Insurance won't appeal the loss of accreditation due to bungled
oversight of insurance companies linked to indicted financier
Martin Frankel.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the state has requested another review this August.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are confident the accreditation committee will find that we
have implemented improvements and addressed weaknesses,'' Tennessee
Insurance Commissioner Anne Pope said in a letter Thursday to the
National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel, a former money manager from Greenwich, Conn., is
accused of bilking more than $200 million from insurance companies
in five states, including Tennessee, where the parent company also
was headquartered.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel fled the country last May as authorities in other states
began investigating his business practices. He is now fighting
extradition from Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Though state insurance examiners had raised concerns about heavy
bond trading by Franklin American Life Insurance Co. of Franklin,
senior officials were said to have ignored them.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel is believed to have financed the purchase of Franklin
American and other companies operated by John Hackney of Franklin.
Hackney claims to be a victim of the scheme and has not been
charged in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The NAIC notified Tennessee last month that its examination
section had lost the accreditation earned in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   There are no penalties, but it could affect how other states
view a department's examination of regulated companies, as well as
recruitment of insurers.

<HEADLINE> Gore: Court Should Decide Elian Fate  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore is unyielding in his
insistence that a court deliberate what is best for Elian Gonzalez
absent a family solution by the Cuban boy's feuding relatives.
</P>
<P>
   He essentially rejected an appeal by the Cuban boy's father for
public support of a reunion with his 6-year-old son while custody
is litigated.
</P>
<P>
   ''That decision ought to be made according to what is in the
boy's best interest. Usually a family court or a decision maker
following those kinds of procedures gives tremendous weight to the
views and preferences of a surviving parent, but not always if
there are other factors involved,'' Gore, the presumptive
Democratic presidential nominee, said Thursday night on CNN's
''Larry King Live.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not say what other factors should weigh into the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, appealed to the public
Thursday for help persuading the Clinton-Gore administration to end
the five-month father-son separation.
</P>
<P>
   A caller to the talk show told Gore the Miami relatives who have
been caring for the boy were ''breaking the law'' by refusing an
order, after their temporary custody was revoked, to return Elian
to his father who is in the United States but wants to return to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you condone this lawbreaking?'' the caller asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''I advised them to abide by the law and they have said that
they will,'' Gore replied.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Chris Lehane later clarified that Gore had not spoken
with Elian's U.S. relatives. ''That's a public counsel he's
proffered,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier while campaigning in New Jersey, Gore urged the feuding
relatives to try to resolve the custody dispute ''without
government officials or lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked on CNN about another looming political battle, Gore said
he was open to including the Reform Party presidential nominee in
fall presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
   Reform candidate Pat Buchanan has filed a complaint with the
Federal Election Commission arguing for a spot in those key,
nationally televised forums.
</P>
<P>
   The Commission on Presidential Debates has ruled that only
candidates with 15 percent standing in five national public opinion
surveys may participate in the debates. Buchanan, who is seeking
the Reform nomination, polls in single digits.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a mixed feeling about that,'' Gore said. ''It depends
on the level of support that they have, whether it would enhance or
impede the debate. I have an open mind about it. But I think that
we need to know more before a decision like that is made.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gore is bringing in reinforcements for his
presidential campaign team and stocking the Democratic National
Committee with loyal aides in preparation for the fall election.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Fabiani, a former Clinton White House spokesman who helped
the president weather Whitewater and other controversies, is
joining Gore's team this week as deputy campaign manager for
communications, the most visible face of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Among other promotions and new faces, Michael Whouley, credited
with helping to build Gore's teams for New Hampshire and Iowa last
winter, will become senior political strategist as a consultant to
both the campaign and the DNC. Donnie Fowler Jr., field director at
the campaign, will coordinate his efforts with Whouley.
</P>
<P>
   Also at the Democratic National Committee:
</P>
<P>
   -- Laurie Moskowitz will work on the coordinated campaign
efforts. She was a political operative at the DNC before moving to
Gore's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   -- Laura Quinn will move from Gore's White House office to be
communications director at the DNC.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on the CNN show with his wife, Tipper, Gore was asked
by another caller whether he would consider a Cabinet or other
appointment for Hillary Rodham Clinton if he wins the White House
and she loses her Senate race in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''She would be an excellent public servant in virtually any
position, but that's a hypothetical I'm not going to entertain
because I'm for her and I think she is going to win,'' Gore said.

   SINKING SPRING, Pa. (AP) -- A man was arrested today and charged
with four counts of homicide for allegedly pushing the car of his
former girlfriend into the path of an oncoming train, killing her
and three others.
</P>
<P>
   Candace Wertz made a frantic 911 call on her cellular phone and
was talking to a dispatcher when her car was struck by the train
Thursday, state police Cpl. Bruce Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Angel Diaz Santiago, 22, of West Reading was taken into

were not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Also taken into custody but not arrested was an unidentified man
who was believed to be in the car Thursday when Santiago allegedly
rear-ended Wertz's car and then pushed it in front of the train,
Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   Wertz, 20, and her 2-year-old son, John Michael Cortez, were
pronounced dead at the scene. Cynthia Jacques, 22, and her daughter
Allissa, 2, died after being taken to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Wertz's sister-in-law, Tammy Wertz, said Wertz had planned to
move from Sinking Spring to another town because her boyfriend was
physically and verbally abusive.
</P>
<P>
   ''She just couldn't get away from him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The crash happened about 4:30 p.m. Thursday at a crossing on the
main thoroughfare in Sinking Spring, a town of about 2,400 people
50 miles northwest of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   It followed a half-hour chase in and around town that reached
speeds up to 90 mph, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Wertz went around a car that was parked at the crossing -- the
gates were down because of the oncoming train -- and then stopped in
the oncoming
</P>
<P>
   ''The second vehicle came up behind her and struck her in the
rear. The second vehicle then pushed the first vehicle onto the
tracks,'' Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   The Norfolk Southern freight train was going about 40 mph at the
time of the collision, Edwards said. He said the engineer applied
the brakes but was unable to stop in time, dragging the woman's car
nearly 60 feet before coming to a rest.
</P>
<P>
   A 14-year-old girl who was at a playground near the crossing
said the two cars slammed on their brakes and stopped before the
second car revved its engine and shoved the first car onto the
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It happened really fast and at first I thought it was an
accident,'' Katie Connors said. ''But I could hear screaming for
just one split second and then the train tried to brake, but it was
too late.''
</P>
<P>
   The train was carrying mixed cargo including lumber, concrete
and syrup, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Wertz's cousin Scott Wertz: ''Everybody is more or less in
shock, and no one knows what happened. She was a good person and
she must have gotten into some kind of bad situation.''

<HEADLINE> Giuliani's Wife Going Off-Broadway  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Actress and television personality Donna
Hanover, the wife of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, is joining the cast of
the sexually frank off-Broadway hit ''The Vagina Monologues'' next
month.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning May 30, Hanover will take over a lead role in the play
written by Eve Ensler, a personal friend and political supporter of
Hillary Rodham Clinton, Giuliani's opponent in the U.S. Senate
race.
</P>
<P>
   Joannie Danielides, Hanover's spokeswoman, confirmed the
casting. Calls seeking comment from the mayor's office were not
returned this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Hanover will perform in the stage show for two weeks, sharing
the play's dozen or so monologues with two other women.
</P>
<P>
   The monologues are constructed from interviews Ensler held with
women on topics including orgasm, uncomfortable pelvic exams,
sexual abuse, sexual fantasies and childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   Ensler had been performing all of the monologues herself until
February, when the she began sharing the lead with rotating trios
of performers, including Broadway performers such as Audra McDonald
and singer Alanis Morissette.
</P>
<P>
   Hanover has appeared on the big screen in films including ''The
People vs. Larry Flynt'' and ''Light it Up,'' and on TV in soap
operas such as ''One Life to Live'' and ''All My Children.'' She
also is the host of a program on the Food Network.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has refused to answer questions about his relationship
with his wife despite reports that their 16-year marriage is
strained. Earlier this year, a reporter asked why he had stopped
wearing his wedding ring. He responded, ''I respectfully suggest
that that's none of your business,'' emphasizing the last four
words.
</P>
<P>
   The couple have two children.

<HEADLINE> Hollywood Melds Actors, Athletes  </HEADLINE>
By MARK KENNEDY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- After months of searching, director Gina
Prince-Bythewood finally found just the right actress to star in
her debut movie.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one hitch: Sanaa Lathan couldn't dribble.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always knew she was a great actor, but she had never picked
up a ball before,'' says Prince-Bythewood. ''I was, like, 'I can't
hire someone who can't play ball!'''
</P>
<P>
   So Lathan endured a five-month, six-days-a-week training session
just to be able to lay-up and post-up like a pro in
Prince-Bythewood's new ''Love and Basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Director James Toback had the opposite problem while making
''Black and White.'' He had to turn a couple of athletes -- New York
Knicks star Allan Houston and boxer Mike Tyson -- into actors.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to give them something that feels close to the way
they would talk and the way they would think,'' says Toback.
''You're basically just asking them to respond the way they would
respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Jocks memorizing dialogue? Actors practicing three-point shots?
It can mean only one thing: Hollywood's love affair with sports is
at fever pitch.
</P>
<P>
   And watch out: It's getting harder to tell the two worlds apart.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you talk about sports and Hollywood, you really have a
marriage of two truly central American institutions. America is a
society that likes to watch things,'' says Charles E. Marskie, a
St. Louis University sociologist.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in an era where people are flush with money. Enormous
amounts of that money are pouring into entertainment and sports.
And it seems to me that sports has become almost indistinguishable
from entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson and Houston are only the latest in a wave of jocks hitting
the screen. Football legends Dick Butkus, Johnny Unitas, Barry
Switzer and Jim Brown recently appeared in ''Any Given Sunday,''
while former linebacker Lawrence Taylor snagged roles in ''The
Waterboy'' and ''Any Given Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Basketball stars Dennis Rodman, Shaquille O'Neal and Michael
Jordan have each made films, while Kobe Bryant has dipped his toe
in the world of entertainment with a debut CD. Can a Tiger Woods
cameo be far behind?
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder actors are becoming jocks. This summer, Keanu
Reeves runs the fictional gridiron in ''The Replacements.''
Boxing's especially hot among filmmakers: On the heels of ''The
Hurricane,'' ''To the Bone'' and ''Price of Glory,'' this summer
brings ''Girlfight,'' while Will Smith has been hitting the heavy
bag to play Muhammad Ali.
</P>
<P>
   (At the box office, sports movies have found both victory --
''Rocky'' -- and defeat -- ''Price of Glory''.)
</P>
<P>
   Before Ali, though, Smith plays a golf caddy and spiritual guru
for Matt Damon in a summer flick, ''The Legend of Bagger Vance,''
directed by Robert Redford (''Downhill Racer'' and ''The
Natural'').
</P>
<P>
   ''The infatuation with athletes among people from all walks of
life is at a high point. It's the ultimate form of celebrity,''
Toback says. ''Essentially, they are at the center of the whole
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's attraction to athletes is nothing new, of course.
One of the earliest films ever was a real 1897 prize fight in Las
Vegas between James J. ''Gentleman Jim'' Corbett and Robert
Fitzsimmons.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next century, sports lent its built-in drama and
symbolism to hundreds of films, from ''The Pride of the Yankees''
to ''The Longest Yard'' to ''Chariots of Fire,'' from the triumph
of Rocky Balboa to the brutality of Jake La Motta.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, the small screen -- which turned mere athletes into
celebrities in the first place -- is changing the way athletes are
portrayed on the big screen. With ESPN and a smorgasbord of sports
on the airwaves 24 hours a day -- even spilling over into fictional
behind-the-scenes shows like ABC's ''SportsNight'' -- how can
Hollywood compete?
</P>
<P>
   Sports on the big screen now has to look even more authentic to
audiences reared on up-close, instant-replay sports coverage.
</P>
<P>
   That's why actor Jon Seda, a former Golden Gloves boxer, was a
natural to cast for ''Price of Glory;'' it's why Ray Allen, a pro
basketball player, anchored Spike Lee's ''He Got Game''; and why
Kevin Costner threw fastballs until his arm ached in ''For Love of
the Game.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also the reason Sanaa Lathan had to spend hours pounding a
gym floor before the cameras could roll on ''Love and Basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   But films also have to aim for more.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's so much pure sports on cable that to produce a movie
that's simply a replication of sports on the field doesn't seem to
me to add much,'' says Marskie.
</P>
<P>
   Prince-Bythewood agrees: ''There seems to be a little less
sports involved in the actual movie itself. That's probably
because, especially with basketball, you've got the NBA on every
single day. And how can you make your footage that much different
than what people are actually seeing on their televisions?''
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of her movie's opening this weekend, the critics she
feared most weren't film critics.
</P>
<P>
   ''My scariest screening actually was for the women's Olympic
team and the WNBA's veterans' camp,'' she says. ''If there's anyone
out there that will diss her basketball -- if they see any little
thing -- it will be them.''

<HEADLINE> Conflicting Studies Confuse Doctors  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY, AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- This time it is fiber, which contrary to the
collective wisdom of the brightest minds in medicine apparently
does not ward off colon cancer after all.
</P>
<P>
   The specifics change, but the pattern is the same: Over and
over, the conventional medical wisdom collapses under the weight of
new evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Remember when salt was evil? When eggs were the soul of dietary
wickedness? When estrogen seemed like an iron shield against heart
disease?
</P>
<P>
   Now it is pretty clear that salt is not an important cause of
high blood pressure. Most people probably can eat an egg for
breakfast without triggering a heart attack. And estrogen? No one
really knows how that will turn out, but there is doubt about the
long-accepted assumption that it keeps the heart working smoothly
after menopause.
</P>
<P>
   So how does this happen? Why do health rules fall apart after
they are chiseled in stone? And how do they get to be rules in the
first place?
</P>
<P>
   Many health professionals say it comes down to the willingness
of all involved -- the scientists, the news media and the public --
to draw firm conclusions from a stew of often poorly conducted,
contradictory and incomplete observations.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the problems is that strong recommendations have often
been made on very weak data,'' says Dr. Walter Willett of the
Harvard School of Public Health. ''It may have been the best guess
at the moment. But often the recommendations are repeated so many
times that people forget they were rough guesses in the first place
and come to think they are hard facts.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say everything is wrong or likely to be
overturned tomorrow. For instance, scientists feel absolutely
certain that smoking is bad.
</P>
<P>
   Many are reasonably sure that obesity is harmful over the long
haul. And they are comfortable recommending that people avoid
saturated fat and eat lots of fruits, vegetables and whole grains,
even though the exact benefits of some of these aren't entirely
clear.
</P>
<P>
   Willett says one reason for the today-it's-good-for-you,
tomorrow-it's-not phenomenon is the well-intended ''missionary
zeal'' of scientists who believe their own work and happily repeat
the seemingly solid bottom line without going into the complexity
and uncertainty of the whole business.
</P>
<P>
   Another essential player in this process, scientists like to
point out, is the news media.
</P>
<P>
   ''You get the two-sentence synopsis that turns a complicated
issue into a black or white, a yes or no,'' says Lynn L. Moore, an
epidemiologist at Boston University School of Medicine. ''That's
not a great service.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas Pearson of the University of Rochester notes that
some scientists seem bent on encouraging the boldest headlines for
their research, and get plenty of help from the reporters who
interview them.
</P>
<P>
   ''The probing question is, 'What does this mean?' Reporters
don't want the usual blah-blah answer, which is, 'We really need
more research,''' Pearson says. ''Between science and the press, we
have confused a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, science is a messy process. No single study, no
matter how large or careful, is likely to settle an important
health question.
</P>
<P>
   Sorting out the influence of genes, food, pollutants, living
habits and all the rest requires drawing together information from
many different scientific approaches. These include experiments in
lab dishes, tests on inbred rats, observations of large groups of
people and human experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Data from all of these kinds of science went into the rise and
fall of the idea that fiber prevents colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The theory began in the 1970s. Scientists noticed that poor
people in rural Africa get much less colon cancer than do
better-off Westerners. Of course, the differences between these two
populations are too numerous to count, but an obvious one was the
Africans' higher consumption of fiber.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, many lines of evidence seemed to support the theory.
For instance, it was shown that people who immigrate to places
where colon cancer is common take on a higher risk as they adopt
the eating habits of their new home. In the lab, experiments showed
that animals fed cancer-causing toxins seem to be protected by
high-fiber diets.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the idea made sense. Fiber makes the stools bulkier
and perhaps more likely to dilute cancer-causing substances. Fiber
also makes these bad things flow more quickly through the digestive
system.
</P>
<P>
   The data seemed convincing enough for health agencies to
recommend high-fiber foods as one way of preventing colon cancer,
the second-leading cancer killer, even though the evidence was
conflicting at best.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, two large federally financed studies put the theory to
the test by putting people on low-fat, high-fiber diets. The
meticulously run experiments found no evidence this lowers the risk
of polyps, which are the first stage of colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Willett's team came to the same conclusion by an entirely
different method. The researchers followed the eating habits of
88,757 nurses for 16 years and found no hint of an effect of fiber
on colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we published it last year, it was heresy to say the data
don't support a major benefit of fiber in reducing colon cancer,''
Willett says. ''Now we know that if there is a benefit, it's not
very large, because it is not just one study showing this.''

<HEADLINE> New York reaching for future grapples with past  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BAINBRIDGE, N.Y. (AP) -- In a small town, government officials
and archeologists are carefully reburying human bone fragments that
may date to 30 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   In Albany, a city like many in the Northeast's Rust Belt,
developers find its hard to turn a shovel of dirt without exposing
windows to the past.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, the issue is a recurring one where European
settlements date to the 1600s and American Indian civilizations
date back thousands of years before that. The goal of historic
preservation often conflicts with the needs -- and deadlines -- of
development.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the conflict is played out in several parts of
upstate New York where recovering from recession and a lost
industrial base is often Job One.
</P>
<P>
   In Bainbridge, 26 miles northeast of Binghamton, human remains
that could date to 30 B.C. will be reburied during a June 17
ceremony with Onondaga and Oneida tribal representatives, officials
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The bone fragments are believed to be those of a child. Other
artifacts were uncovered by a Binghamton University archaeological
team headed by Nina Versaggi. They were found in a small wetlands
park.
</P>
<P>
   The artifacts became an issue when the town wanted to build a
small dam to keep water in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The project required archaeological investigations. Thirty pits
were dug and the artifacts that were found were taken to the state
university for analysis. One was an apparent 2,000-year-old fire
pit, often a hotbed for archaeological finds.
</P>
<P>
   In Albany this week, a small piece of a century-old potter's
field has been unearthed behind an old National Guard armory.
That's where a major project called University Heights is being
built.
</P>
<P>
   The four reasonably well-preserved coffins remain, reburied, on
the site. Their uncovering was no great surprise because old maps
show that the site had once been Almshouse Square, or,
unofficially, the county poor farm.
</P>
<P>
   Historians know that approximately 1,875 bodies are on the land
behind the armory and the David Axelrod Institute of Public Health,
which includes the former drill field and tennis courts of a
private school that recently relocated to the suburbs. And that's
counting only the bodies buried from 1880 to 1920. There could have
been other burial sites in Almshouse Square, which was established
in 1820.
</P>
<P>
   The development will include a hotel, convention and retail
center. The aim is to create a new focal point for the city settled
by the Dutch in the 1600s.
</P>
<P>
   State Assemblyman John McEneny, D-Albany, believes the same
standards should be applied to marked and unmarked graves as
American Indian burial sites, which are protected by federal law.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the discovery of Indian remains on construction
sites, McEneny said, ''everything comes to a halt, and things are
done right.'' That does not always happen at other burial sites.

<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENS FALLS, N.Y. (AP) -- Motivated by price increases, more
smokers are adopting a practice common in the 1800s -- making their
own cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no way I want to pay $4 per pack,'' said Thomas
Fleming of Argyle. ''This cuts my cost to about $1 per pack, it
tastes good, and it burns longer and tastes better than a regular
cigarette.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco retailers in the Glens Falls area reported a four-fold
increase in sales to people who buy tobacco and craft their own
cigarettes to save as much as three-quarters of the price of
manufactured cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Although people traditionally rolled tobacco into a cigarette
paper to make their own, now more and more homemade cigarettes are
being made by packing the tobacco into a pre-formed paper tube,
complete with a filter, retailers reported.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming has been packing his own cigarettes for about a week,
after deciding to take action to cut the cost of his cigarette
smoking. He was alarmed by the $11.10-per-carton increase in state
taxes, which sent the cost of 10 packs above $40.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming used to just open a new pack to start the day before
leaving for work.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he gets up a little earlier, sets out his cigarette machine
beside his cup of coffee, and packs about 20 cigarettes -- a day's
worth.
</P>
<P>
   ''The guys at work are amazed, they ask -- 'You rolled those?
How did you do that?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Saving $1,000 annually is Fleming's motive, he said. But also,
he gets to custom blend his own smoke, creating the right taste
with just enough menthol.
</P>
<P>
   Melinda Blair, manager of Cigarettes Cheaper, said that just
after the March 1 tax increase, the store's sales of make-your-own
supplies and tobacco quadrupled, and it is growing week by week as
people tell others of the advantages of homemade over manufactured
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sales of cigarette packing supplies have increased
drastically since the tax increase,'' Blair said. ''Some people
think they can't make a good cigarette, but after they try, they
find out it's easy, and they can make one that tastes close to the
manufactured brand they are used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Strodel of D&AMP;G Hardware in Warrensburg said sales of
make-your-own supplies have boomed since the tax increase.
Three-quarters of his store's revenue comes from cigarettes, and a
growing portion of that is from homemade cigarette supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Underwood, a clerk at Broad Street Discount Cigarettes in
Glens Falls, also reported spiraling sales of cigarette tubes and
bulk tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   ''Making your own is a fast-growing trend,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarettes Cheaper stocks about 12 blends of tobacco, about 15
varieties of cigarette tubes -- including light and full-flavored
filters -- and several styles of packing and rolling machines.
</P>
<P>
   Machines cost from about $5 to $33, and the store has been
selling 20 to 30 machines per week, clerk Lelajo Taylor estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Shamaine Robaire of Queensbury said she likes to choose what
goes into her cigarettes, including the opportunity to buy tobacco
without additives, preservatives or fillers.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a health benefit, she figures. Since she and her
husband have been making their own, they've slashed the number of
cigarettes they smoke from nearly three packs per day each to about
one, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're more satisfying, they burn slower and I don't feel
like I need as many,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> 30 Hurt in Spain Easter Stampede  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- A man brandishing a large knife triggered
a stampede at a Good Friday procession in this southern Spanish
city, leaving 30 people injured in the crush.
</P>
<P>
   All but two of those injured had been released by Friday evening
following the chaos that broke out in the crowd of 500,000 that
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Police said in a statement that they had arrested a 26-year-old
who was seen brandishing a knife and threatening passers-by around
the time the crush started. The man, whose name was not released,
had a record for petty crime in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Police initially suspected a blast caused by the bursting of a
water pipe had caused the panic.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 500,000 people were on the street of Seville at the
time to watch the Good Friday religious procession, one of several
held through Easter week in which large-sized statues of Christ or
the Virgin Mary are taken through the streets on ornate and
flower-bedecked floats.
</P>
<P>
   The processions, held in towns and cities throughout Spain, are
particularly popular in Seville and attract tens of thousands of
tourists.

<HEADLINE> Is Stock Market a Bull or a Bear?  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A three-day weekend couldn't have come at a
better time for Wall Street professionals.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the market looked fairly healthy, recovering a
substantial portion of the previous week's crushing losses. A broad
range of stocks rose, from blue-chips to beaten-down technology
shares.
</P>
<P>
   But volatility reigned, and market analysts couldn't shake a
persistent fear that the bear that loomed over Wall Street in early
April hadn't yet gone into hibernation. The market had survived two
precipitous dips, but few analysts were ruling out the possibility
of a third.
</P>
<P>
   ''Essentially, we've seen bear markets and bull markets two days
apart,'' said Barry Hyman, senior equity analyst at Ehrenkrantz
King Nussbaum. ''People are very confused.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyman, along with many Wall Street analysts, cautioned that the
factors that drove the Nasdaq composite index and the Dow Jones
industrial average dramatically lower the week of April 10 remain
in place. Interest rates are rising, signs of inflation have popped
up in the buoyant economy and many stocks remain very expensive
relative to their expected stream of earnings.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, argues Ned Riley, chief investment strategist at
State Street Global Advisors in Boston, the market never really
completed the four stages that he believes are necessary in a
full-blown correction.
</P>
<P>
   ''All week long, people have been asking me whether we're in the
initial stage of a correction, or is it already over?'' he said.
''In my judgment, we have been in a correction for quite some time
-- longer than two weeks, certainly -- and it's not over.''
</P>
<P>
   In Riley's view, every significant stock market correction has
begun with a period of exuberance, with investors driving stocks
higher and pouring more money in on the belief that the ride up
won't end.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had reached maniacal levels of exuberance,'' he said. ''And
that drove a lot of stocks to prices they did not really deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   The second phase, Riley said, is indifference.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last year, as the economy continued to percolate along, the
market just ignored signs of inflation, and the not-so-subtle
tightening of monetary policy,'' he said. ''There was complete
indifference to a mounting pile of negative news.''
</P>
<P>
   In early April, Riley said, the third phase kicked in: fear. On
April 4, both the Nasdaq and the Dow recorded their widest point
swings in history. At various points in early afternoon, the Nasdaq
fell 574.57 points and the Dow tumbled 504.15. Analysts invoked the
word ''panic'' for the first time since 1998, and brokerages began
a round of margin calls to collect money from clients who had
borrowed funds to buy more stocks during the market's headiest
days.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Riley said, was that the fear didn't last.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you took a long lunch that day, you missed it,'' he said.
Investors took the steep drop as a cue to buy more stocks, putting
a halt to the climactic selling that usually drives a market to a
true ''bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   As many analysts predicted, the market did have farther to fall.
The week of April 10 brought the worst carnage, with the Dow losing
a record 805.71 points and the Nasdaq plummeting a record 1,125.16
points and losing a record 25 percent of its value.
</P>
<P>
   But by the following Monday, buyers were stepping back in, if
cautiously. Gains this past week may have prevented the market from
reaching the final stage of a true correction, Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   ''And that's capitulation,'' he said. ''If exuberance is when
investors see no ceiling, capitulation is when they see no floor,''
and leave the market en masse.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts pointed out that investors found fundamentally sound
reasons to buy this past week. Strong corporate earnings provided
the biggest catalyst. Also, the economic calendar was too quiet to
reignite fears of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet just as analysts tiptoed around the notion of a bear market
last week, few were ready to describe the current market in truly
bullish terms.
</P>
<P>
   ''For now, both the bull and the bear have gone away and
hidden,'' Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, all major stock indexes posted strong gains. The
Dow Jones industrials rose 538.28 points to close the week at
10,844.05. On Thursday, the blue-chip index rose 169.09.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite rose 322.59 points for the week. A loss of
62.53 on Thursday left the index at 3,643.88.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 gained 77.98 points during the week,
rising 7.07 on Thursday to close at 1,434.54.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 28.11 on the
week. The index slipped 4.39 on Thursday, finishing the week at
481.84.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilshire Associates Equity Index, which represents the
combined market value of all NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues,
ended the week at $13.249 trillion, up $774.78 billion from last
week. A year ago, the index was $11.914 trillion.

<HEADLINE> American Demand for Cars Runs High  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN HYDE, AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Neither falling stocks nor rising gas prices nor
higher interest rates seem to keep Americans from buying new cars
and trucks at a blistering pace.
</P>
<P>
   Auto executives say their sales are still running high despite
the stunning freefall in stocks earlier this month. Sales also have
survived the run-up in gas prices, even for the gas-thirsty pickups
and sport utility vehicles. And the five interest rate increases
from the Federal Reserve since June, and the prospect of more to
come, have had little to no effect.
</P>
<P>
   Sales for the first three months of this year ran at a faster
pace than last year, when the industry was building to a record of
16.9 million cars and light trucks. Industry economists had
predicted a slight slowing of sales, but most have now revised
their estimates for 2000, saying it will equal 1999.
</P>
<P>
   David L. Littman, chief economist with Comerica Bank in Detroit,
said there is no shortage of reasons why auto sales are staying
strong. Jobs are plentiful, with the government reporting this past
week that new claims for unemployment benefits had hit a 27-year
low. Consumer confidence has stayed high; the Conference Board's
Consumer Confidence Index hit a new high in January, although it
has retreated a bit since then.
</P>
<P>
   Littman also says record profit-sharing checks for employees at
major American automakers and a 13 percent growth in tax refunds
increased the amount of cash people had to spend in the first three
months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   And automakers have turned to cost reduction as a major source
of profit, keeping price increases equal to or less than inflation.
The market has become so competitive on price that rebates and
incentives have grown this year and automakers have absorbed some
interest rate increases instead of passing them to consumers
through finance deals.
</P>
<P>
   The result, according to Littman, can be seen in Comerica's auto
affordability index, which measures how many weeks of median family
income it takes to buy a car. Littman said the index stands at 23.8
weeks -- the least in 19 years.
</P>
<P>
   Another tool Littman uses to forecast the auto industry is
growth in disposable personal income. Last year, when that
statistic predicted a record year, Littman didn't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ''This year, it's looking fundamentally the same,'' he said.
''It's saying auto sales will be up from last year's total.''
</P>
<P>
   While the run-up in stock prices has helped auto sales, the
''wealth effect'' from investments is weaker than personal income
or prices, Littman said. It has the most effect on the luxury end
of the market, and as a psychological measure of economic health.
</P>
<P>
   ''But if (the stock market) had continued plunging, it would
have affected general retail and by extension automobiles within
one quarter,'' Littman said.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers contend there's yet another reason for strong sales.
Foreign companies have targeted the U.S. market, shipping in new
models. Meanwhile, General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and
DaimlerChrysler AG have been trying to reduce the amount of design
time a new model takes.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a faster turnover of models and a wider variety.
Several new models have seen far more demand than supply, including
the Chrysler PT Cruiser and the Nissan Xterra. Ford keeps the plant
that builds its full-size SUVs running around the clock, and says
that many of its truck models are selling out.
</P>
<P>
   ''The combination of good economic times, high consumer
confidence, strong product development and prices that are as low
as they have been in the past 20 years has resulted in very strong
demand,'' Ford chief executive Jac Nasser said.
</P>
<P>
   Even automakers on the higher end say they're not feeling
worried about the market jitters. Lexus said Thursday that its
inventories were still very low. The company has a 9-day supply of
some models, when 60 days is the industry norm.
</P>
<P>
   After the stock market plunge on Friday, April 14, ''we had a
great weekend,'' Bryan Bergsteinsson, Lexus Group vice president
and general manager, said Thursday. ''People were showing up and
buying cars.''

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Duo Works Hard for Riches  </HEADLINE>
By GREG MYRE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- Customers stream into the Kuong Ngan
motorbike shop from morning to night, plop down stacks of $100
bills and speed off on shiny new Hondas, adding several decibels
and a bit more congestion to Hanoi's frenetic streets.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam's wheezing state-run economy continues to putter in low
gear despite limited market reforms that have slowly opened it up.
The roaring success of Kuong Ngan underscores the Southeast Asian
nation's vast potential but unrealized growth.
</P>
<P>
   Owners Dang Thi Ngan, 42, and her husband, Khuc Manh Kuong, 48,
are among the small number of Vietnamese who have struck it rich
under ''doi moi,'' the economic renovation process that began in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   The open-air shop at one of Hanoi's busiest intersections has
turnover that just about any Western business would envy -- an
average of 70 motorbikes a day at around $2,000 each, according to
Ngan. There's no credit, and at 14,000 to the dollar, it would take
a suitcase full of Vietnamese dong to buy a bike, so most customers
use $100 U.S. bills that they hoard against inflation -- this in a
country where the average annual income is $370.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are the biggest shop in Hanoi,'' said Ngan, a smartly
dressed woman with two gold necklaces, six rings and several
bracelets jangling from wrists and ankles. ''We don't need to
advertise because everyone knows us by reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's gotten much easier to open a business, but it still takes
a lot of hard work to make it a success.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple's tale illustrates the challenges of doing business
under a communist government that officially favors market reforms
but fears yielding control.
</P>
<P>
   They opened the modest shop in 1989, buying up used motorbikes
one at a time, mostly from government officials who were among the
few people with money and access to goods made abroad.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, cheap bicycles dominated Hanoi's then-tranquil
streets. Today, motorbikes rule the road, converging on traffic
circles like a swarm of angry hornets. A decade hence, small cars
likely will clog the tree-lined boulevards.
</P>
<P>
   The shop is open 12 hours a day, seven days a week, and either
Ngan or her husband is always present. The two employ 55 people and
are actively looking for foreign partners to provide expansion
capital and to offer managerial expertise, virtually nonexistent in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Several shops they opened in outlying provinces failed because
it was hard to find good managers, Ngan said, and most people in
smaller towns opt for cheaper motorbikes like Soviet Minsks that
sell for maybe a quarter of the cost of the Hondas.
</P>
<P>
   The bustling Hanoi shop has given the couple a large new house,
a big Mercedes -- and an ever-expanding workload. Their last brief
vacation was three years ago. Their only immediate ambition is to
get their 18-year-old daughter into an American university after
she graduates from high school this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still in the process of expanding our business,'' Ngan
said. ''Maybe in the future we will have time to relax.''

<HEADLINE> Teen Found Guilty in Mom's Death  </HEADLINE>
By PAT LEISNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A 17-year-old girl whose mother was choked,
injected with bleach and stabbed to death was convicted Friday of a
lesser charge of third-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   The jury rejected a first-degree murder charge, for which
Valessa Robinson could have been sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum sentence for third-degree murder is 15 years, but
the state's sentencing guidelines, which take into account a
variety of factors, could set a much different term. Valessa has no
prior criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, which deliberated 17 hours after a 10-day trial, also
found her guilty of petty theft and grand theft auto stemming from
the death of her mother, Vicki.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a very, very complex decision,'' juror Ray Straub said.
''We did not rush to judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Circuit Judge J. Rogers Padgett set sentencing for May 30.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Robinson was trying to separate her then 15-year-old
daughter from Adam Davis, a 19-year-old drifter, when she was slain
in June 1998. She was choked, injected with bleach and stabbed to
death on her kitchen floor.
</P>
<P>
   The single mother of two teen-age girls planned to send Valessa
to a school for troubled teens.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution said Valessa initiated the killing, then held
her struggling mother down. In her closing arguments, assistant
state attorney Shirley Williams focused on statements by Valessa
that she wanted to kill her mother and afterward, that she had
killed her mother.
</P>
<P>
   But assistant public defender Dee Ann Athan depicted Valessa as
a child and a victim and blamed her friends for the killing.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial Valessa wore school-girl clothing that softened
the hardened look in a poster size blow up of her booking mug
presented to the jury.
</P>
<P>
   At times, especially during descriptions of the murder scene,
she bowed her head at the defense table and cried. Once, she was
excused from the courtroom at her request before pictures were
introduced of her mother's lifeless body stuffed headfirst into a
trash can for disposal.
</P>
<P>
   The defense hammered at the theme that Valessa was a love-sick
and impressionable child and an unwitting tool of Davis who
manipulated her with sex and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Valessa, Davis and their friend Jon Whispel were on LSD the
night of the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Athan told the jury in her closing arguments that Davis and
Whispel killed the mother, then dragged Valessa along as they fled
cross-country in the woman's van with her credit and bank cards.
</P>
<P>
   Whispel, the state's key witness, was portrayed as a liar. ''If
Jon Whispel were Pinocchio, his nose would be so big we would not
fit in this room,'' Athan said.
</P>
<P>
   She said Davis killed the mother, then Whispel and Davis cleaned
up the blood-splattered kitchen and dumped her body into the trash
can for burial. When the ground in a wooded area was too hard, they
hid the trash can in some shrubs, planning to come back later. They
never did.
</P>
<P>
   When they learned authorities were looking for Vicki Robinson,
Valessa, Davis and Whispel fled to Texas. They were captured in
Pecos County following a high-speed chase.
</P>
<P>
   Whispel pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and is serving 25
years in prison under a plea bargain for his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was convicted of first-degree murder and is on death row.

<HEADLINE> Reno To Meet Elian's Dad Again  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno has exhausted
almost all options and is waiting for law enforcement officials to
determine the best time and method to remove Elian Gonzalez from
his Miami relatives. But she still hopes the family will
voluntarily turn over the 6-year-old Cuban boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just trying to work it out,'' Reno told reporters. ''I'm
exploring every possibility I can to see this resolved peacefully,
promptly and properly.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she was on the verge of ordering law enforcement agents
to remove Elian from his Miami relatives' home, Reno replied, ''If
I were going to do something like that, I certainly wouldn't tell
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno scheduled a meeting at the Justice Department this
afternoon with the boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who had
asked for a session Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart said today the
turnover of the boy ''should be now done in a prompt and orderly
way.'' He said a ''good volume'' of calls was received on the White
House comment line Thursday night, ''overwhelmingly in favor of
reuniting the boy with his father.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Justice Department received more than 7,000 telephone
calls after Juan Miguel Gonzalez made a televised appeal Thursday
afternoon for Americans to urge Reno and President Clinton to help
him get his son back quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ''If necessary the attorney general is prepared to use law
enforcement'' to pick up Elian over the objections of relatives who
have temporarily cared for him since Thanksgiving, Justice
Department spokeswoman Carole Florman said. ''If and when there's a
law enforcement action, we are not going to be previewing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Florman portrayed Reno as virtually out of options other than
law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have always been three trains moving simultaneously down
the track -- negotiations for a transfer, litigation and law
enforcement,'' Florman said. ''We are no longer in the engineer's
seat on the negotiation train. We're just passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ''She is looking to our law enforcement officials to determine
the best timing and methods'' for removing Elian from the house
where hundreds of Cuban exiles have gathered, promising to form a
human chain to prevent the boy's removal, Florman said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Florman said, ''The doors are always going to be
open to the family for a negotiated settlement. She said last night
she is willing to consider any specific suggestions for how to
achieve a cooperative resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Planning for law enforcement operations has been under way for
the last 10 days, Florman said. This has included assessment of any
patterns in the activities of the crowd of exiles in the street,
consultation with local police and positioning of key federal
agents nearby, other officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a plan. There's probably more than one,'' Florman
said today.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Clinton said a court ruling has stripped Elian's
Miami relatives of all arguments against transferring temporary
custody to his father. ''That is the law,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton commented after a three-judge panel of the federal
appeals court in Atlanta said Elian must remain in the United
States until the court decides whether he should get an asylum
hearing. A hearing was set for May 11.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was viewed by the Miami relatives and their allies as
a victory, but Clinton said it reinforced the administration's case
for Elian to be reunited with his father.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post today quoted unidentified government
officials as saying they expected a law enforcement move to
retrieve Elian by the middle of next week. USA Today quoted
officials as saying the action would come next week.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the Miami relatives indicated today that the
great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, who has control of Elian, and other
family members will not assist federal agents' attempt to take the
boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''So he's not going to cooperate?'' attorney Jose Garcia-Pedrosa
was asked on CBS' ''The Early Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Without a psychological evaluation that says that that is in
the best interest of the boy in the opinion of a professional, not
a lawyer or an immigration official, that's correct,''
Garcia-Pedrosa replied.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, making his strongest statement to date on the case,
said he knew of ''no conceivable argument'' against the custody
transfer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he (the father) should be reunited with his son,'' the
president said. ''That is the law. And the main argument of the
family in Miami for not doing so has now been removed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their main argument was if we let him go back to his father
before the court rules, he might go back to Cuba. The court has now
said he shouldn't go back to Cuba. The Justice Department agrees
with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton generally has been standing back and leaving the
decisions in the Elian case to Reno, who last week ordered the
Miami relatives to turn over the boy. The family refused.
</P>
<P>
   ''The attorney general is leading the effort,'' presidential
spokesman Joe Lockhart said Thursday. ''The president has been
briefed and has had input. Is she making the decisions here? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than two hours before Clinton spoke, Elian's father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, asked Americans to write to Clinton and Reno,
urging them to act decisively to end the five-month father-son
separation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't let them continue to abuse my son,'' the elder Gonzalez
said, referring to the Miami relatives who have been caring for
Elian since he was found clinging to an inner tube off the Florida
coast on Thanksgiving Day. Elian and two others survived, but his
mother and 10 others fleeing Cuba drowned when their boat sank.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was promised that I was going to be reunited with my son,''
he said, speaking in Spanish near his temporary home in suburban
Maryland. ''Two weeks have gone by and it hasn't happened. I have
always understood, I have always thought, that the United States is
a country which abided by its laws.''

<HEADLINE> Germans Gather at Targeted Temple  </HEADLINE>
By WILFRIED GLOEDE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ERFURT, Germany (AP) -- Germans laid flowers and held a vigil
Friday outside a small synagogue after it was targeted in an
attempted arson attack, possibly by neo-Nazis angry that police had
broken up a party celebrating Adolf Hitler's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I ask myself what kind of kids these are who would do such a
thing,'' said Manfred Ruge, mayor of the eastern city of Erfurt,
where the attack happened late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This cannot be excused,'' he said, noting that Passover
celebrations had just been held in the building.
</P>
<P>
   The attackers threw a glass bottle filled with diesel fuel at
the back wall of the synagogue just after 10 p.m. Police said the
fuel spilled onto a footpath and the flames were quickly stomped
out by residents. The building was undamaged.
</P>
<P>
   A note was found about 100 yards from the scene claiming the
attack was anti-Semitic and signed with ''Heil Hitler!''
</P>
<P>
   A short time before, police had broken up what they described as
a ''Hitler party'' in a nearby street because illegal Nazi symbols
were observed. German authorities are on heightened alert each year
on April 20 -- Hitler's birthday -- for neo-Nazi gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one people were briefly taken into custody from the
party, and police said some had been released before the attack and
were being investigated. Police also were reviewing a videotape
from a security camera installed on the synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   But at an afternoon news conference, state police director Peter
Werner said they had been unable to make out any suspects from that
group. Although far-right extremists were still considered the most
likely suspects, he said investigators had not ruled anything out.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Silke Becker said the computer-printed claim of
responsibility was not exactly consistent with a spontaneous
attack. Police also noted that it included a German word usually
used by left-wing radicals as an insult for neo-Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   In Berlin, German government spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye
condemned the ''cowardly attack'' and called for quick action to
arrest those responsible.
</P>
<P>
   The synagogue in Erfurt, capital of Thuringia state, was the
first rebuilt in East Germany after World War II. Finished in 1952,
it replaced one that had been burned to the ground by the Nazis
during the 1938 Kristallnacht pogrom, or ''Night of Broken Glass.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor visited the synagogue Friday to meet with Jewish
community leaders, including state chairman Wolfgang Nossen, who
called for stronger action against right-wing violence. Thuringia,
an economically depressed state of 2.5 million people, has a Jewish
community of only about 600.
</P>
<P>
   A stream of Erfurt residents stopped by the synagogue throughout
the day, a public holiday because of Christian Good Friday
observances. Several laid bouquets of roses and spring flowers in
front of the building.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm here to show solidarity,'' said Thomas-Michael Austel, a
Lutheran priest. He added that the attack was particularly shocking
because it came in a year that the week of Passover overlaps
Easter.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, police in western Hesse state said Friday they had
arrested 46 people celebrating Hitler's birthday at two neo-Nazi
parties Thursday night. Most were held only temporarily, although
seven were jailed overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities confiscated banned neo-Nazi flags, swastika
stickers, music CDs and cassettes as well as hashish.

<HEADLINE> Jones To Head Harvard Press Center  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Alex
S. Jones has been named director of the Joan Shorenstein Center on
the Press, Politics and Public Policy.
</P>
<P>
   The host of the PBS show ''Media Matters,'' Jones is a
fourth-generation journalist who has made a specialty of covering
the media.
</P>
<P>
   He covered the news industry for The New York Times from 1983 to
1992, where he won a Pulitzer Prize in 1987 for coverage of the
collapse of the Bingham family's journalism empire in Louisville,
Ky.
</P>
<P>
   The Shorenstein center, part of the John F. Kennedy School of
Government at Harvard University, is a think tank dedicated to the
study of how the media, politics and public policy interact. It
seeks to bridge the gap between journalists, scholars and the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 53, will join the Kennedy School in July. He currently
shares a chair in journalism at Duke University with his wife,
Susan Tifft. Last year, the couple co-authored ''The Trust: The
Private and Powerful Family Behind The New York Times.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm really excited about it,'' Jones said. ''The Shorenstein
Center's job is illuminating the way the press affects politics and
public policy. I don't think there's ever been a time when it's
more important to understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Patterson, acting director of the center, said Jones was
chosen because of his ''moral authority'' in the area of
professional ethics and for his ability to bridge academics and
professional journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need someone comfortable in both worlds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been both a reporter and a media critic within the press,
then in addition has some academic background wtih his time at
Duke,'' Patterson said. ''All of those things came together in a
way that says this is someone who has nearly the ideal background
for someone to direct the center.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones will succeed Marvin Kalb, the former network newsman, who
stepped down as Shorenstein director last year.

<HEADLINE> States Mull Tobacco Money Spending  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID MILES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- Picture a barroom brawl among angels.
</P>
<P>
   That's how a struggle over how to spend money from the $206
billion settlement with Big Tobacco is shaping up across the
nation. People full of good intentions are fighting over a pot of
gold.
</P>
<P>
   The battle is especially intense in Kansas, where anti-tobacco
advocates are fighting for money that could also buy vaccines,
establish anti-drug programs in schools or help fund local health
departments.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea of pitting us against each other is wrong to begin
with,'' said John Pepperdine, who lobbies for the American Cancer
Society.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas legislators haven't yet decided exactly which programs
will get tobacco money when the state's next budget takes effect on
July 1. But they have committed themselves to spending most of the
state's $1.77 billion share on programs that provide services to
children -- most of which have nothing to do with preventing
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1998 national settlement, the initial expectation was
that most of the money would support health programs across the
country, especially anti-smoking campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, only a few states have come close to pledging
the minimum amount suggested by federal officials to wage an
effective anti-smoking campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Many states instead plan to use the money for purposes unrelated
to health -- deficit reduction, schools, capital construction.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan even proposed using the city's
share to cover lawsuits arising out of a scandal in which police
officers allegedly framed innocent people. The City Council
rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, many legislators have for years worried the state
hasn't spent enough on health care for children, early childhood
education or other such programs. They have argued such programs
prevent youngsters from developing serious health problems or
becoming criminals.
</P>
<P>
   But they couldn't find the money to back up their rhetoric --
until the tobacco settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas legislators diverted nearly $81 million of the state's
share to help balance the budget and deal with other financial
problems. But they also created a children's trust fund and a
15-member Kansas Children's Cabinet to recommend exactly which
programs should get money.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas isn't alone in spending tobacco money on children.
</P>
<P>
   A survey released this month by the National Conference of State
Legislatures shows that at least 12 states plan to use at least
some of the money from the settlement on programs for children and
adolescents.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-one states plan to spend settlement money on health care,
23 on elderly care and 10 on helping tobacco farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, programs designed to prevent people from smoking remain a
popular choice for states; forty-four plan to spend settlement
dollars on anti-tobacco programs.
</P>
<P>
   That frustrates Kansas' anti-tobacco activists.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-smoking advocates argue Kansas is forgetting why it sued
tobacco companies -- to recoup the cost of medical care for poor
Kansans with smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Of the first $30 million allocated for children's programs in
Kansas, Republican Gov. Bill Graves proposed that $500,000 go to
anti-smoking programs -- one-fifth of what the Children's Cabinet
recommended.
</P>
<P>
   Graves' spokesman, Don Brown, defended the proposal as part of a
''broad-stroke'' approach to provide money for many children's
services.
</P>
<P>
   But the American Cancer Society's Pepperdine wants at least a
third of all proceeds from the settlement to go toward tobacco
prevention. Over 25 years, that would be about $590 million.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, health advocates are getting little sympathy
from most Kansas legislators, including Rep. David Adkins, a
Republican who is chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe the anti-tobacco people need to quit pouting and get
their act together,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Teacher Suspended for Spit Incident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUGAR LAND, Texas (AP) -- School officials are investigating
allegations a second-grade teacher ordered students to punish a
pupil by spitting on him.
</P>
<P>
   Madeline Raven, 27, was placed on leave Thursday, said school
district spokeswoman Martha Morrow.
</P>
<P>
   Yolanda Clark said she learned of the incident when she picked
up her 8-year-old son David from Briargate Elementary on Wednesday.
He had on a different shirt from the one he wore to school.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I asked him where his other shirt was, he said the
teacher had made the other children spit all over him,'' she said.
''I just couldn't believe it when he told me. He said he didn't
want to go to school anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said David and another student were involved in a spitting
contest when the teacher caught them. For punishment, the teacher
ordered other students to spit on David, the boy's mother said.

<HEADLINE> Bong -- Not Bomb -- Clears School  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) -- Investigators treated a bong as a
possible bomb and evacuated 1,000 students on the anniversary of
the Columbine High School shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb scare occurred after seven teen-agers who were walking
Thursday behind Roland-Grise Middle School ran when approached by a
deputy assigned to the school. A search turned up a cardboard
fireworks tube.
</P>
<P>
   Because the seven wouldn't tell officers what the tube
contained, the school was evacuated and the students were taken to
a park nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed parents flocked to the school to pick up their children
while police blocked off streets.
</P>
<P>
   Only after a bomb squad destroyed the tube did detectives learn
that it was being used to carry a bong, a pipe for smoking
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we have is a B-O-N-G, not a B-O-M-B,'' said sheriff's
Capt. David Smithey.
</P>
<P>
   Two students were released without charges. One 15-year-old was
charged as a juvenile with possession of drug paraphernalia. The
four others were charged as adults and released on $1,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   The school was on heightened security because of the Columbine
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   ''They picked a bad day,'' Smithey said.

settlements. In
1998, 46 states agreed to a $206 billion settlement, to be paid out
over 25 years. Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi and Texas had
already reached their own deals for a combined $40 billion.

   Figures are in billions and are a total over 25 years. Planned
spending refers to initial expenditures of settlement money.

   The list is not meant to be all-inclusive, and many states have
not finished drawing up their spending plans.

   Report: Bank One Subject of Probe
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Bank One Corp. is reported to be under
investigation by federal regulators for possible violations
involving its creation in 1998. The Wall Street Journal said today
that the regulatory arm of the National Association of Securities
Dealers is investigating Banc One Capital Markets, Bank One's
investment-banking unit. The report said the problems surfaced
after the merger of the Midwest's two biggest banks -- Columbus,
Ohio-based Banc One Corp. and First Chicago NBD Corp. -- creating
Chicago-headquartered Bank One, the nation's fifth-biggest bank.
Among the areas reportedly being investigated are account
reconciliation and bookkeeping problems.

   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) -- Six West African nations have signed an
agreement to share a common currency within three years. The
countries that signed the agreement are Ghana, Nigeria, Liberia,
Sierra Leone, Gambia and Guinea. The signatories pledged to
immediately create a regional central bank and reduce annual
inflation to five percent by 2003. The declaration also suggests a
possible monetary union with eight other West African countries
that already share a French-backed currency, the CFA franc.

   Software Group Knocks Italy Ruling

   TURIN, Italy (AP) -- An international association of leading
software manufacturers today sharply criticized an Italian judge's
ruling that it is no crime to duplicate software for personal use.
''We are extremely worried about the implications this sentence may
have,'' said Claudia Pavoletti, head of Business Software
Alliance's Italian branch. Under Italian law, one judge's decision
does not necessarily serve as precedent for similar cases. BSA said
it will keep seeking damages in court in all cases of illegal
duplication.

   Alaskan Senate OKs Cruise Ship Tax
</P>
<P>
   JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- The Alaska Senate has approved a bill that
would require cruise ships to pay a $50 tax on each passenger they
bring into Alaska waters. The measure now goes to the House, where
its future is uncertain. Sen. Rick Halford, a Republican, argued
that the profitable and mostly foreign-owned cruise ships pay
little to operate in the state. ''This is all of Alaska for $50,''
he said. ''They are selling Alaska and we are giving them Alaska to
sell.'' But other senators cited concerns about the bill's fairness
and the possible impact on tourism.

   Poland To Probe Financial Leak

interest rates in February was leaked to some investors. The
central bank asked for the probe. Julita Sobczak, spokeswoman for
Warsaw prosecutors, said the course of the investigation would be
kept secret ''because of the nature of the information and its
importance for the country.'' Bank officials said earlier this

Ballots will be mailed next week to the airline's 11,000 flight
attendants, who rejected a tentative agreement last August. They

pilots went on a 15-day strike in 1998 that crippled the airline

<HEADLINE> Arafat Aide Affirms Peace Demands  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the Middle East peace process facing
''the moment of truth,'' a top Palestinian official said Friday a
state envisioned by Chairman Yasser Arafat must include all of the
West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, areas captured by Israel
in the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is going to be a Palestinian state along the June 4,
1967, boundaries, with East Jerusalem as its capital next to
Israel,'' said Saeb Erekat, a Palestinian negotiator who
accompanied Arafat to Washington to meet with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Territorial concessions that Israel is prepared to make are far
more modest than those foreseen by Erekat. On Thursday, the State
Department said agreement is possible only if both sides are
prepared to settle for less than their maximum demands.
</P>
<P>
   Erekat spoke at a news conference that was to have been held by
Arafat. Erekat said Arafat was tied up in discussions with
Palestinian colleagues that grew out of Arafat's Thursday meeting
with Clinton. The president met last week with Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton was satisfied
with both discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the president felt the meetings of the last two weeks
with the leaders face to face were very productive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Erekat admitted that given the differences with Israel on
territorial and other problems, a new round of negotiations opening
this month ''is not going to be an easy process.''
</P>
<P>
   The first phase of the talks will be in the region and will be
April 30-May 12.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have set a Sept. 13 target date for resolution of
all issues, including the status of Jerusalem, settlements,
borders, refugees and water.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know the difficulty of the issues,'' Erekat said. ''We know
that we are at the moment of truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Erekat cautioned Israel against renewed settlement activity.
''We should work in an atmosphere devoid of any unilateral steps,
any unilateral actions that may reflect negatively on the
atmosphere required to achieve agreement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Erekat expressed confidence that Clinton ''will exert every
effort'' to help the parties reach a comprehensive settlement.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said ''a tough piece
of business'' lies ahead for the two sides, but the administration
believes ''there is new momentum and a new resolve'' to come to an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan Abdel Rahman, the Palestine Liberation Organization
representative in Washington, said U.N. Security Council Resolution
242 will be the basis for Palestinian territorial demands.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution requires Israel to withdraw from occupied
territories.
</P>
<P>
   Rahman said agreements with Israel specify clearly the coming
negotiations should lead to implementation of 242.
</P>
<P>
   Present for the upcoming negotiations will be Ambassador Dennis
Ross, special envoy for the Middle East, and his deputy, Aaron
Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said the two will be ''looking to expand those elements
where there is common ground, and doing that by pushing each side
to fully explain their position, to focus on the practical and not
the theoretical, and see how far they can get.''

<HEADLINE> Free Speech Notion in Elian Case  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN CLENDENNING, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A radio show host with a shirt saying Elian
Gonzalez should go back to Cuba is shoved around by an angry crowd.
A week later, a man with a similar message is branded a
''pro-Castro instigator'' by the crowd, and police hustle him away
for his own safety.
</P>
<P>
   In Little Havana, where whispered suspicions race through the
crowd daily outside Elian's home, the First Amendment right to free
speech is limited to those who insist the 6-year-old boy should not
go back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Those who express contrary opinions do so at their own risk.
</P>
<P>
   Bienvenido Comas, 27, a demonstrator, says rival protesters have
a right to voice their opinions -- just not here.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's illegal for somebody to come in here and incite a riot,
and you're trying to incite a riot doing that,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   There have been only sporadic incidents of violence since Elian
arrived here nearly five months ago, and police credit the
protesters themselves with preventing fights. But Miami has a long
history of violence linked to its large and powerful Cuban
community.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-'70s, radio station news director Emilio Milian lost
his legs below the knees in a car bombing after speaking against
violent extremists. The Miami Herald later was labeled pro-Castro,
its vending machines were vandalized and its editors received death
threats.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, a pipe bomb exploded at a Miami Beach nightclub,
canceling a concert by Cuban salsa star Manolin. No one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to Elian, experts say a mob mentality is growing
in Miami as the protests drag on. They say the exhilaration that
comes from defying the U.S. and Cuban governments leads to
irrational behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're getting everything you're going to get in a sports
stadium. It's driven to extremes, and it's carried by hatred,''
says Kenneth Richardson, a psychologist at Ursinus College in
Collegeville, Pa., who specializes in group dynamics. ''Once you
get that, it destroys reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of protesters gather daily near the Little Havana home,
and dozens spend the night in small circles of lawn chairs, sipping
strong, sugary Cuban coffee. Many of the anti-Castro Cubans see
spies and provocateurs all around them.
</P>
<P>
   That stern man talking on a cellular telephone? In hushed
voices, demonstrators conclude he must be a spy sent by Castro.
</P>
<P>
   One night last week, 57-year-old housewife Josefina Rosenthal
noticed a man who hadn't joined in with the others in chanting
''Elian Isn't Going Away'' in Spanish. His stony demeanor convinced
her he was a troublemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking a cigar near the Gonzalez home, 67-year-old Humberto
Perez says Cuban Americans know spies are at work because that's
what happens in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're watching everything,'' Perez says. ''If you come home
at 2 a.m., they know it. If you have a package, they know it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a frenzy,'' says Guillermo Grenier, a sociologist with
Florida International University who also does polling on Cuban
American issues. ''This can be seen in history as something
equivalent to the witch trials in Salem.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ''The Cuban community is in tune ideologically with
the best of the Constitution. But when an issue deals with Cuba,
the behavior shows, 'We are exiles and anyone who preaches what we
left we are against.'''

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers: Get Troops Out of Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
By ALISON MUTLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Uneasy over the prospect of an
open-ended peacekeeping mission, visiting American lawmakers urged
U.N. administrators Friday to schedule local elections as soon as
possible to speed the day when foreign troops can go home.
</P>
<P>
   Elections would be the first step in establishing a functioning
government in this southern Serbian province, which has been
administered by the United Nations and NATO since Yugoslav forces
withdrew in June after the 78-day Western bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know it is going to be absolutely essential that people here
create a government that functions because countries can't keep
this number of troops here indefinitely,'' Sen. Jeff Sessions,
R-Ala., said after meeting with the senior U.N. administrator,
Bernard Kouchner.
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner, a former French Cabinet minister, made no comment
after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Many NATO officers here have said privately they believe
peacekeepers will have to remain in Kosovo for years before they
can leave behind a province with any chance of stability.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, two separate gunbattles in the volatile region along
Kosovo's boundary with Serbia proper killed two people and left two
policemen injured, the independent Beta News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority wants independence from Serbia
-- the larger of the two remaining Yugoslav republics. The United
States and its allies oppose full independence, as does Belgrade,
which would probably try to reassert control if peacekeepers leave.
</P>
<P>
   Sessions, however, warned that with an election this year in the
United States, there would be pressure to reduce U.S. participation
in peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is going to be pressure, and we need to bring them
home,'' he said, referring to the troops. ''This country needs to
be on its feet as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the delegation, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison,
R-Texas, said the group had come to the Balkans ''to see what the
progress is for the formation of a stable government, and hopefully
the beginning of democratic elections.''
</P>
<P>
   After visiting U.S. troops, the delegation flew to Croatia,
where they met the country's president and prime minister to
discuss military and economic cooperation. The delegation will
spend Easter Sunday with American troops in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Local elections are expected this fall, but no date has been
set. On Friday, an international official said Kosovo Serbs failed
to participate in initial efforts to register the population.
</P>
<P>
   After visiting U.S. troops, the congressional delegation flew to
Croatia, where they met the country's president and prime minister
to discuss military and economic cooperation. The delegation will
spend Easter Sunday with American troops in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   No date has been set for local elections in Kosovo, but they are
expected later this year. U.N. officials have mixed views about the
prospect of elections in a backward area still recovering from the
effects of the 18-month Serb-Albanian conflict that prompted U.N.
and NATO intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Elections would confer legitimacy on a new set of local leaders
and settle rival claims of leadership by groups loyal to former
Kosovo Liberation Army leader Hashim Thaci and others allied with
his rival, moderate Ibrahim Rugova.
</P>
<P>
   However, elections could also widen the gap between ethnic
Albanians who want independence for Kosovo and minority Serbs, many
of whom may boycott the balloting because of their loyalty to
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Elections could also trigger violence within the factious ethnic
Albanian community as would-be leaders compete for power.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, many in the U.S. Congress see voting as a first
step toward ending a peacekeeping operation that they supported
only reluctantly -- even though American troops are without doubt
the most popular among the overwhelmingly Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am personally encouraged by the steps toward democracy and
the planning for elections that will occur on a local level in the
months ahead,'' said Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   There are 37,000 NATO-led peacekeepers in Kosovo, including
5,900 Americans.

   But with so little land and no access to the loans needed to buy
the proper tools, pesticides and fertilizers, Chikosha, 53, has
never been able to eke a profit from his farm. He has mostly
reverted to subsistence farming.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am a farmer since forever,'' Chikosha said. But after years
of hard work, ''you're left with nothing at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Zimbabwe, thousands of squatters supported by
President Robert Mugabe have occupied hundreds of white-owned
farms, demanding the land be parceled out to the country's
impoverished blacks. But for the 90,000 blacks who have already
been given land, resettlement has rarely led to prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two-thirds of the almost 7.5 million acres bought from
white farmers and distributed to landless blacks have reverted to
mainly subsistence plots. The government says it does not have the
money to install the roads, water pipes and other necessary
infrastructure to make those plots profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Chikosha and 39 other farmers live in Chiota, 40 miles southeast
of Harare, on what was once a single white-owned farm that raised
tobacco and cattle.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the white farmers, who can use their land as collateral
for bank loans to buy the tractors and pesticides needed to
properly utilize the land, Chikosha and the other resettled black
farmers do not own their farms. The state holds the deeds and
simply gives them farming rights. Small government loans allow
Chikosha to buy nothing more than a little fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Chikosha's land sprouts maize, groundnuts and other
subsistence crops. But he has reserved a tiny corner of his farm to
nurse his dreams of prosperity -- tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Experts have told him that his tobacco plot has the potential to
reap more than 6,500 pounds of the crop. Chikosha has never come
near that output. Last year he harvested almost 2,000 pounds and
earned $800, which just covered his costs.
</P>
<P>
   Other farmers don't even break even. Five of the farms in
Chikosha's resettlement area were abandoned to weeds and logs after
their farmers found it impossible to make a living.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the farmers in Chiota are better off than the millions of
Zimbabweans who have no land.
</P>
<P>
   At independence in 1980, the government had planned to
distribute farmland to 170,000 landless blacks by 1990. Twenty
years later, the government has managed to resettle just 90,000
families.
</P>
<P>
   Few argue against the need for continued land reform in a
country where 4,000 white farmers own one-third of the productive
farmland, but opposition politicians say the government's efforts
have been plagued by mismanagement and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have demonstrated over the last 20 years that they are
unable to implement fundamental land reform themselves,'' said
Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the main opposition party, the
Movement for Democratic Change.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 20 years, the government has purchased about 8.65
million acres of farmland from white farmers. But 740,000 acres of
that land has yet to be distributed and another 1.2 million acres
has gone not to landless blacks but to government officials and
cronies.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people who really need the land have been marginalized in
their own exercise,'' Tsvangirai said.
</P>
<P>
   The government has had the opportunity to acquire much more of
the land under a law mandating that white farmers seeking to sell
their land must offer it to the government. Since independence,
about 70 percent of white farms have changed hands under this law,
white farmers said.
</P>
<P>
   A constitutional amendment rejected by voters in February but
passed by Parliament in April allows the government to seize the
white-owned land without paying compensation. This has led to fears
about the future of Zimbabwe's largely white-owned commercial
farms, which comprise about 40 percent of the country's export
revenue and employ one-quarter of Zimbabwe's workers.
</P>
<P>
   But others here have their own concerns. As he surveys his tiny
plot, Chikosha laments that it may not be enough to support his
family.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want more,'' he says.

<HEADLINE> World Again Tackles Ethiopian Hunger  </HEADLINE>
By ELLEN KNICKMEYER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) -- In 1985, famine in Ethiopia seared
the consciences of Bob Geldof and his celebrity friends, uniting
rock stars, royalty and a worldwide audience estimated at 1.5
billion people in an unprecedented, heartfelt outpouring of feeling
good by doing good.
</P>
<P>
   The Live Aid concert and its predecessor, Band Aid, raised $110
million and inspired a genre of marathon celebrity charity efforts
like USA for Africa and Farm Aid. Band Aid's ''Do They Know It's
Christmas?'' became the fastest-selling single on record.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, Ethiopia's starving are back on the world's TVs. The
familiar images of stick-thin kids with doomed eyes raise
frustrating questions: Again? Didn't all that effort help at all?
</P>
<P>
   The answers, in short: Yes. And yes, it did, actually.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a potential to avert it this time. And that's really
significant. Clearly that's much, much better than chasing the
game,'' said Charles Walker of British-based Oxfam, one of the
charities that worked closely with Live Aid.
</P>
<P>
   Last time, under a then-military Ethiopian government accused of
using supply blockades as one its deadliest weapons, hundreds of
thousands are believed to have starved to death by the time the
world acted.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the intensity of the public response, an estimated 1
million people died.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the outcry is in part a pre-emptive one. The U.N.
World Food Program this month is issuing urgent warnings of massive
food shortages across the Horn of Africa if donors don't come
through immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The warning comes with the death toll still in the hundreds or
low thousands among the hardest-hit ethnic Somali herders of
Ethiopia's southeast -- although with aid on the ground still
minimal, the famine claims more victims daily, and is spreading,
Ethiopia warned Friday.
</P>
<P>
   One key difference between 1985 and 2000: A 355,000-metric-ton
strategic food reserve, a famine early warning system and a famine
response plan, all put in place or refined since the 1983-85
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The measures are ''very much an outgrowth of the 1980s, as a way
to keep a handle on the situation in Ethiopia,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, any self-congratulations by Ethiopia or
international donors can pretty much stop there.
</P>
<P>
   While the emergency reserves helped sustain millions through the
first of what are now three years of drought, international donors'
tardiness on pledges meant the reserves were down to just 50,000
metric tons by the time the WFP warnings went out this month.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the international community committed itself to supporting
food security and then failed, then that is a very disturbing
matter,'' said Simon Maxwell of the British-based Overseas
Development Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Aid agencies say the European Union in particular had fulfilled
only half its pledges. The EU, which defends its efforts, in turn
blames Ethiopia for failing to end its 23-month-old border war with
Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
   At the least, the border war complicates aid delivery. It's also
widely seen as diverting Ethiopia's own resources away from the
famine and risking donors' suspicions that any aid might benefit
fighters more than the starving.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia and Eritrea, ranked among the world's 10 poorest
countries, each spend an estimated $1 million a day on defense, the
British-based International Institute for Strategic Studies says.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the World Food Program's chief urged international
leaders to push harder for an end to the region's conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is only one long-term (solution) -- that is peace,''
Catherine Bertini told reporters after a weeklong tour of Horn of
Africa nations, the area of the looming famine.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, peace would be just a start. Maxwell estimates that
Ethiopia, with sub-Saharan Africa's second-largest population,
needs 50 years of economic development to break the cycle of
famine.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Ethiopia depends entirely on rain-fed agriculture -- a
losing prospect in a region where rainfall patterns are changing.
Government administration and services are weak in the hardest-hit
area; none of the strategic reserve warehouses are even near it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, what was the world's first TV famine evoked the
compassion of everyone from the now-forgotten Sade to the
now-immortalized Princess Diana, who with Prince Charles kicked off
the Live Aid concert at Wembley Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, world will to provide long-term development aid -- or
even short-term relief -- may be lagging.
</P>
<P>
   Geldof, knighted and nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize after
Live Aid, did not respond to requests for comment this week from
The Associated Press. Intermediaries indicated he was busy with a
new album and tired of being misquoted as a famine spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Geldof told the BBC earlier this month of a ''repugnance'' at
the return of mass starvation to Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   A natural reaction -- and potentially, a hopeful one, said
Oxfam's Walker.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ultimately, if we don't want to be here again, this seems to
be the time to let our (British) government know, to let other
governments know, that something has to change,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Tough Vote for Rep. Wu on China  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HUGHES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The China trade bill isn't just about jobs or
imports and exports for Rep. David Wu.
</P>
<P>
   It's about freedom. The kind that allowed him, an immigrant from
Taiwan, to earn a law degree, open a law firm and become the first
Chinese-American elected to the House.
</P>
<P>
   The freshman Democrat from Oregon says granting permanent trade
privileges to China will stifle efforts to expand freedom there. He
wants the United States to press for more reforms in China before
passing a trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   So he'll vote against the measure next month, even though that
could cost him his job. Trade with China is key in his district.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish I could change my values on this, but if I did I would
not be true to everything that my parents have done -- and I think
to everything that countless others have sacrificed -- in order to
give me and others the ability to speak out on this issue here in
America,'' said Wu. His position conflicts with that of President
Clinton, who wants permanent trade privileges for China.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, scheduled for a vote the week of May 22, would extend
to China the same low-tariff access to U.S. markets enjoyed by
almost every other U.S. trading partner. China already has this
access, but it must be renewed annually. The bill would end these
annual reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to pass the bill would prevent U.S. businesses from
gaining greater access to Chinese markets and deny Americans
greater protection from Chinese import surges, the Clinton
administration says.
</P>
<P>
   Wu, 45, was born in Taiwan, which split with communist China 51
years ago. When he was 4 months old, his father left the family to
pursue an American education. His parents lived apart for six years
before the family reunited in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The family then moved to California, where his father worked as
an engineer. David graduated first in his high school class, got
his undergraduate degree from Stanford, attended Harvard medical
school, earned a Yale law degree and co-founded a law firm in
Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   This life story weighs heavily on Wu as he prepares to vote on
the China trade bill. Immigrants helped build America's model of
freedom, he said, and Americans must continue to press for
democracy, human rights and rule of law at home and in places like
China.
</P>
<P>
   Although many Democrats are expected to vote against the bill,
Wu's stand is daring considering that his Portland-area district is
a ''silicon forest'' of high technology start-ups and corporate
giants including Nike and Intel.
</P>
<P>
   China is a key trading partner for Oregon and other states in
the Pacific Northwest. The only other lawmaker in the region who
has pledged to vote against the bill is Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore.
Ten other Democratic House and Senate members from the Pacific
Northwest will vote for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., a leading bill opponent, suggested that
Wu not sign a letter to Clinton railing against the measure because
it could hurt him. But Wu signed it anyway and then stood beside
the House's No. 2 Democrat, Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, to
release the letter at a March 30 news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Trade proponents are upset by Wu's high-profile opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm frankly disappointed,'' said Brad Figel, a lobbyist for
Nike, which has one-third of its footwear production in China.
''It's one thing just to oppose China ... but he's decided to take
it to a higher level.''
</P>
<P>
   Nike would see lower import tariffs on finished products and
materials and get more intellectual property protection if China
gains entry into the World Trade Organization, something the
Clinton administration believes will occur if the bill passes.
</P>
<P>
   Nike's political action committee made campaign contributions to
each of Oregon's House members since the last election, although
the $500 Wu and DeFazio received was less than the $1,000 and
$1,500 donations for the other three Oregon House members. Figel
said the PAC is taking a wait-and-see approach regarding future
donations to Wu.
</P>
<P>
   Wu's position on China trade is backed by organized labor, which
doesn't have a strong presence in Wu's district but donated the
most money to his campaign last year, about $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Both Republicans who want to run against Wu this fall support
permanent trade status for China and say they will make it a top
campaign issue. State Sen. Charles Starr called Wu's view ''an
extreme position,'' while former Lake Oswego Mayor Alice Schlenker
said the issue ''is one of jobs in Oregon.''
</P>
<P>
   Wu won his seat in 1998 with just 50.1 percent of the vote.
Anticipating a tough re-election, he amassed a campaign war chest
of $413,000 by the end of 1999, nearly 15 times the combined total
of the two GOP candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Evans, a trade staffer for former Sen. Mark Hatfield,
R-Ore., said Wu's stance on China trade has been consistent, and
that may help him.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people who suffer the most are fence-sitters,'' said
Evans, who lives in Wu's district. ''People who have clear
positions are usually given the benefit of the doubt. They (voters)
don't like someone who is taking the temperatures, taking the
polls.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Reaches to McCain Supporters  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush is broadening his circle of
campaign advisers to include his father's old supporters and
officials once aligned with former rival John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   One political graybeard, former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney,
could be tapped to head the Texas governor's search for a running
mate, Republican officials said Friday. Cheney was out of the
country and unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's reaching out to establishment Republicans will not change
campaign decision-making, said a senior adviser to the Texas
governor. The campaign will remain Austin-based and continue to be
steered by top aides who have been with Bush since his first
gubernatorial campaign in 1994: Karl Rove, Karen Hughes and Joe
Allbaugh.
</P>
<P>
   The advisory group of more than two dozen volunteers is to
contribute ideas and suggestions on everything from the Republican
National Convention this summer to Vice President Al Gore's
vulnerabilities. The members include a trio of advisers to former
GOP candidate John McCain: campaign manager Rick Davis and
Republican veterans Vin Weber and Kenneth Duberstein.
</P>
<P>
   The group also includes Mary Matalin, deputy manager of Bush's
father's 1992 campaign; Charles Black, who advised the White House
bids of Bob Dole and Phil Gramm; former Republican National
Committee chairman Haley Barbour, former Rep. Bill Paxon of New
York and Ed Gillespie, former senior adviser to House Majority
Leader Dick Armey of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a way of structuring it so we meet in groups and organize
our advice,'' Black said Friday, adding that he was unclear on
Rove's specific group assignments. ''Karl needs to give us a little
more specific mission for each group.''
</P>
<P>
   The formalization of the group follows talk that the campaign
was being run by advisers not tested by national politics. Such
criticism is commonly leveled at presidential campaigns by members
of a party's establishment who are not consulted.
</P>
<P>
   This week, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich took the criticism
of Bush public, complaining that Bush's team ''still has a little
bit of Austin in their style'' and is ''not quite up to speed yet''
in running a national campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Black said Rove had been talking about formalizing an advisory
group of establishment Republicans for three weeks, long before
Gingrich publicly complained.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing in Cheney to steer the vice-presidential search would
give the campaign a big dose of experience. Cheney, now chief
executive officer of Halliburton Co., a Dallas-based engineering
and construction company, served President Bush as defense
secretary and President Ford as chief of staff. Before that, he was
a Republican congressman from Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Gore's running-mate search is headed by Warren
Christopher, who helped President Clinton choose his first Cabinet
and then served as secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation on Bush's prospective running mates has focused on a
number of Republican governors and McCain. Other possibilities
include former presidential rival Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   The news that Bush was formalizing an advisory group came as a
surprise to some of the panel's members, who have been giving
advice to the campaign for months, according to interviews with
these officials.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has relied on many of those advisers before. In a Feb. 10
conference call that included Barbour and Black, for example,
Allbaugh sought advice and tried to calm the jitters of Republican
Party members who had grown concerned about McCain's surge in the
GOP primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''About half these people have been giving a steady stream of
advice all along,'' Black said. ''This is just a formal way of
doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Bush eventually defeated McCain, he still has been
buffeted by criticism that his Texas advisers are inexperienced.

<HEADLINE> Russia Fires on Japanese Ship  </HEADLINE>
By YURI KAGEYAMA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Russia's coast guard fired on a Japanese fishing
boat and seized it Friday near a long-disputed chain of islands,
but both sides played down the possibility the shooting would
strain relations.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 20 crew members aboard the boat were injured,
Japanese officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The incident is the latest in a series of disputes over fishing
waters between the two nations. Russia and Japan have yet to sign a
peace treaty formally ending World War II because of a dispute over
the Kuril islands, about 150 miles north of where Friday's incident
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, the ITAR-Tass news agency said the Russian coast
guard came across the fishing boat in Russian waters with its name
and number concealed.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo officials said they did not know where the pursuit began,
but that it ended in Japanese northern waters when the Russian
patrol fired on the fishing boat, then brought it back into Russian
waters and detained it.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's Coast Guard said it sent three aircraft and four patrol
boats to the scene but they were forced to turn back when the boats
entered Russian waters.
</P>
<P>
   Interfax news agency reported that the boat was being taken to
Yuzhno-Kurilsk island, the southernmost tip of the Kurils.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo demanded the return of the crew, as well as an explanation
of the shooting, the Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides, however, said the shooting would not affect
relations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Similar incidents have occurred in the past and are likely to
occur in the future. But together with the Japanese side, we are
trying to keep them to a minimum,'' Russian Deputy Foreign Minister
Alexander Losyukov told Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not believe the latest trouble will become ''a
significant or dangerous trend in our relations.'' The Japanese
Foreign Ministry also said Japan-Russian relations were not likely
to be harmed.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, who took office earlier this month,
has made clear that he is eager to improve relations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Mori, who is scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir
Putin next week, is anxious to make progress on talks over the
Kuril Islands, which were seized by Soviet troops at the end of
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Japan and Russia agreed in 1997 to try to resolve the dispute
over the islands by the end of this year, but negotiations have
stalled.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has fired on South Korean, Chinese and Taiwanese boats,
as well as Japanese fishing boats that it suspects of poaching in
their waters for rich crab, salmon and herring catches.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a Russian patrol fired on a Japanese boat was in
1997, when two Japanese fishermen were injured, one of them
seriously. Last year, Japanese boats were detained several times by
Russia.

<HEADLINE> Victory statue stolen from Brooklyn park  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- You've heard of victory being snatched from the
jaws of defeat. In this version, ''Victory'' -- all 1,000 pounds of
it -- was snatched from a Brooklyn park.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-foot-tall bronze statue honoring Brooklyn's fallen
soldiers of World War I was discovered missing Thursday from
Saratoga Square Park. A blow torch apparently was used to remove
Victory from its 10-foot-wide by nearly three-foot-tall base in the
middle of the park that occupies one square block.
</P>
<P>
   ''That statue commemorated the war dead, the people from that
neighborhood, the young men who had been killed defending the
freedom of that area,'' Parks Department Commissioner Henry Stern
said Friday. ''And now in the year 2000 the statue commemorating
them and honoring their sacrifice is just stolen. It's like being
killed all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Police have no suspects so far, and believe the thieves were
going to melt the statue down and sell it. It's believed the statue
was snatched either late Wednesday night or early Thursday morning.
Park employees noticed the statue was gone about 8:30 a.m.
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The statue is valued at about $100,000 and had stood undisturbed
since 1921. It was sculpted by James Novelli and cast by Roman
Bronze Works in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. The statue depicts a woman
with her right arm raised and her left arm holding a shield with
''E pluribus unum'' -- Latin for ''Out of many, one.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, several bronze plates listing the names of Brooklyn men
who were killed during the war was stolen, Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   He does not believe whoever stole Victory was responsible for
removing the Peter Pan statue from its pedestal in Manhattan's Carl
Schurz Park in 1998. The statue was fished out of the East River
several months later and returned to its rightful place.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was a prank,'' Stern said of the Peter Pan theft. ''This
here is more serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with information regarding the Victory statue is asked to
call the Parks Department at (800) 201-PARK.
</P>
<P>
   Police also have other statue crimes to solve as well -- who's
behind the desecration of religious statues at Catholic churches
and other such institutions in Brooklyn? Police officials would not
comment if they thought the vandalized statues and the Victory
theft were connected.

<HEADLINE> New lawsuits claim Millstone nuclear plants killing fish  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   STONINGTON, Conn. (AP) -- Fishermen Al Maderia and Tim Medeiros
are fed up -- sick of being over-regulated and tired of being blamed
for the decline of winter flounder in Long Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
   The real culprit for the flounder problem, they say, rests with
the Millstone nuclear power plants in Waterford.
</P>
<P>
   The plants suck in billions of gallons of water a day from
Niantic Bay for their cooling systems, killing off baby fish and
trapping larger fish in intake screens, the fishermen claim.
</P>
<P>
   They said Friday they are suing the plants' operator, Northeast
Utilities, for $12 million to reimburse them for damage to their
livelihoods and for the grief they've gone through with regulators.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fishermen have been blamed for it -- time and time again --
for overfishing, and we're tired of it,'' Medeiros said. ''It's
time we pointed the finger in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   This lawsuit and another claim filed by antinuclear groups and
environmental groups seek to shut down the plants or to curtail
operation during the winter flounder spawning season, now underway.
</P>
<P>
   NU spokesman Joseph Bell would not comment on the claims because
the company's lawyers have not yet reviewed the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be premature to comment until we get a look at the
lawsuit they're bringing,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Hartford Superior Court Judge Robert Hale threw out similar
claims from the groups last May. Hale found that overfishing -- and
not the power plant -- was responsible for a dramatic decline in
winter flounder in the Niantic Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the groups have prepared a report that tracks the
decline of the winter flounder stock in Long Island Sound to the
point of nearly collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Gibson, a fisheries biologist from Rhode Island, reported
that Millstone Unit 3 sucks out about half of the young winter
flounder from the Niantic River.
</P>
<P>
   Northeast Utilities' scientists put the loss of young winter
flounder at 12 percent to 18 percent from the Niantic River,
Gibson's report said.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen insist they are not to blame. Medeiros and Maderia
said the area is such poor fishing that the Stonington fleet has
avoided the area for the past several years.
</P>
<P>
   NU said in November it would install a system to prevent larger
fish from being stuck in the water intake screens.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Burton, the lawyer filing the lawsuits, said the system
has not been installed and nothing is being done to prevent the
deaths of juvenile fish.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing on the environmental groups' claim is scheduled for
May 1 in New London Superior Court. The court has not yet scheduled
a hearing on the fisherman's lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   An appeal of Hale's decision may be argued before the state
Supreme Court this spring, Burton said.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said the groups will file an additional lawsuit in
Hartford Superior Court on Monday over state permits for Millstone
Units 2 and 3. Millstone Unit 1 is being decommissioned.

<HEADLINE> Report: Bank One Subject of Probe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Bank One Corp., still reeling from an exodus of
credit-card customers, a management overhaul and a fallen stock,
now reportedly is being investigated for possible violations
involving its 1998 creation.
</P>
<P>
   The regulatory arm of the National Association of Securities
Dealers is investigating Banc One Capital Markets, Bank One's
investment-banking unit, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday,
citing unidentified sources.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the problems surfaced after the merger of the
Midwest's two biggest banks -- Columbus, Ohio-based Banc One Corp.
and First Chicago NBD Corp. -- creating Chicago-headquartered Bank
One, the nation's fifth-biggest bank.
</P>
<P>
   Among the areas reportedly being investigated by NASD
Regulation, the industry's self-policing organization, are account
reconciliation and bookkeeping problems, supervisory lapses and the
filing of possibly misleading accounting reports with regulators.
Disciplinary action is expected, possibly including fines totaling
more than $1 million, the Journal said.
</P>
<P>
   Bank One officials said Friday they do not discuss regulatory
matters. But they released a statement acknowledging that
''bookkeeping problems resulted from the systems conversion in our
capital markets units and their consolidation in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no impact on customers, their security positions or
their account statements,'' the bank said. ''At year end, our books
and records conformed to industry standards. The financial impact
on the company will be minuscule.''
</P>
<P>
   Telephone messages left with NASD officials were not immediately
returned Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bank One stock closed Thursday at $30.81\ on the New York Stock
Exchange; markets were closed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Shares were trading above $55 until serious problems with the
bank's First USA credit-card unit emerged last August, sparking the
stock's decline.
</P>
<P>
   Former Citigroup president Jamie Dimon took over last month as
Bank One's chairman and chief executive officer, replacing John B.
McCoy, who retired in January. But the high-level management
shakeup continued Thursday with the resignation of Robert Rosholt
as chief financial officer.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Plunge Ahead of Change  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Japan's leading stock index plunged Friday, but for once,
economic woes and worries about Wall Street weren't to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, stocks tumbled 3.7 percent in Tokyo as traders altered
their positions before a planned reshuffling of the stocks in the
Nikkei Stock Average next week.
</P>
<P>
   Many global financial markets were closed in observance of Good
Friday. The currency markets provided the most intrigue, as the
troubled euro hovered near its all-time low. The dollar rose
against the yen but slipped briefly against the euro in quiet
trading.
</P>
<P>
   In Tokyo, the benchmark Nikkei index of 225 stocks fell 706.64
points to 18,252.68 points, wrapping up a week in which the index
lost 2,181 points, or 11 percent of its value.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section rose Friday, confirming analysts' belief that much of
the selling of the Nikkei was technical.
</P>
<P>
   The TOPIX gained 5.12 points, or 0.3 percent, to finish at
1,634.12.
</P>
<P>
   In Tokyo, stocks initially rose as investors were cheered by a
169.09-point rise Thursday in the Dow Jones industrial average. But
later in the session, investors began selling industrial stocks
that will be removed from the Nikkei index starting Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Nihon Keizai newspaper, a major Japanese financial daily and
the administrator of the Nikkei index, is dumping 30 stocks in
favor of younger, technology-oriented companies to reflect changes
in Japan's economy. For example, housewares maker Noritake and
mining company Mitsui Mining will be dropped from the index, while
TDK Corp., a maker of magnetic parts used in disk drives, will be
added.
</P>
<P>
   The change mirrors the shift in the Dow Jones industrial average
last fall, when Chevron, Goodyear, Sears Roebuck and Union Carbide
were bounced from the index in favor of Intel, Microsoft, Home
Depot and SBC Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Changes to a prominent stock index can affect stocks'
performance in a number of ways. Investment funds that try to mimic
the performance of the index generally sell the stocks that are
being removed and buy the new stocks to keep their portfolios in
line with the indexes.
</P>
<P>
   Also, removal of stocks from the index tends to lower their
prestige and makes them less attractive to investors.
</P>
<P>
   Because the stocks being added to the Nikkei are generally more
expensive than the stocks being dropped, traders said investors had
to sell a broad range of shares to raise cash.
</P>
<P>
   ''People were selling not only the old components that will
leave the index, they were also selling those that will stay in the
index,'' said Chuck Lambert, market analyst at Jardine Fleming
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Other global stock indexes were mostly higher. Markets in
Thailand, South Korea and Taiwan finished quiet sessions with
modest gains.
</P>
<P>
   In very light currency trading, the euro drifted close to its
all-time low but ended the day slightly higher against the dollar.
In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at 93.87 cents, up
from 93.82 late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the euro sank briefly to a new low of 93.55 cents
in New York trading, its lowest level since it was adopted in
January 1999 as the single currency of 11 European nations. The
previous low was the 93.57 cents of Wednesday. Before this week's
slump, the euro's low point was 93.90 cents on Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Traders have pushed the euro lower in part because they see
little risk that European authorities are going to defend the
currency.
</P>
<P>
   In late trading in New York, the dollar bought 105.87 yen, up
from 105.73 late Thursday. The British pound was quoted at $1.5778,
down from $1.5793.
</P>
<P>
   In other trading, the dollar was worth 1.6741 Swiss francs, down
from 1.6753, and 1.4754 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4748.
</P>
<P>
   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate.
Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 2.0837 German
marks, down from 2.0842; 6.9883 French francs, down from 6.9902;
and 2,062.82 Italian lire, down from 2,063.37.
</P>
<P>
   Asian and U.S. markets will reopen on Monday, but most European
markets will remain closed until Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Crisis Spreading to S. Ethiopia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) -- Famine caused by three years of
drought is spreading to areas of southern Ethiopia, the head of the
nation's disaster prevention program said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The situation in the Borena and Omo regions near the Kenyan
border is similar to that in the Somali region in the southeast of
the country, where hundreds are believed to have died and tens of
thousands are arriving at feeding centers in search of food, Simon
Mechale told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Borena and Omo, like the Somali region, are home to semi-nomadic
herders who have lost most of their cattle and goats.
</P>
<P>
   Simon termed the international response to Ethiopia's appeal for
emergency food relief ''not yet enough'' but said interest shown by
international donors is ''encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   The government had appealed for 850,000 metric tons of food for
the 8.1 million drought victims until the end of the year. Simon
said pledges from the United States, the European Union, Canada,
Britain, Italy and France totaled 690,034 metric tons. Only a small
portion has actually arrived in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   Following the devastating famine of 1984-85, a strategic
emergency food reserve was set up here. Because the reserve fund
has been depleted and not replenished, it has reportedly drawn down
to 50,000 metric tons. It is supposed to contain 355,000 metric
tons.

<HEADLINE> Reno Meets Again With Elian's Dad  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Virtually out of options, Attorney General
Janet Reno awaited word Friday from her law enforcement agents in
Miami on the best time for them to remove Elian Gonzalez from his
Florida relatives. But she could not give even his father a
timetable for their reunion.
</P>
<P>
   While Reno clung to hope for a last-minute negotiated turnover,
she held a surprisingly short, 15-minute meeting at the Justice
Department with Juan Miguel Gonzalez, father of the 6-year-old
Cuban boy whom Miami relatives have refused to relinquish.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Justice officials said key federal marshals and
immigration agents were being positioned in Miami where Cuban
exiles crowd the street outside the home of Elian's great-uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez. The boy has stayed there since Thanksgiving when
he was found in the Atlantic after his mother drowned in the
sinking of the ship on which they left Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The exiles, motivated by hatred for Cuban leader Fidel Castro,
have vowed to form a human chain to block Elian's removal. For
days, federal agents have been assessing the crowd's patterns of
activity and consulting with local police.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general ''is looking to our law enforcement
officials to determine the best timing and methods'' for removing
Elian from Lazaro's Miami home, Justice spokeswoman Carole Florman
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Lazaro's house, dozens of exiles prayed; others bore
6-foot wooden crosses representing Jesus' crucifixion on Good
Friday. Most of them said it would be a mistake for the federal
government to try to remove Elian by force.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials, who requested anonymity, said an operation to
retrieve Elian was possible this weekend but was more likely next
week, because of the time required to prepare it and a reluctance
to risk violence over Easter.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with Reno, Juan Miguel and his attorney strode
grimly out of the building without comment.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Reno said she told him ''that I could
not commit to a particular course of action or timetable.''
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel, who came here from Cuba two weeks ago to pick up
his son, expressed great concern for the boy and appealed to her
for quick action to effect a reunion, Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was deeply moved by Mr. Gonzalez's evident love for his
son,'' Reno said. ''I assured him I would continue working toward
the goal of reuniting him with his child.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, she told reporters, ''I'm exploring every possibility I
can to see this resolved peacefully, promptly and properly.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she were on the verge of ordering law enforcement
agents to pick up Elian, Reno replied, ''If I were going to do
something like that, I certainly wouldn't tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart said the turnover
''should be now done in a prompt and orderly way.'' President
Clinton spoke with Reno about the case for 45 minutes Wednesday
night, but Lockhart labeled as inaccurate news stories suggesting
he was pushing her to use force.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said a ''good volume'' of calls was received on the
White House comment line Thursday night, ''overwhelmingly in favor
of reuniting the boy with his father.'' The Justice Department
received more than 7,000 telephone calls after Juan Miguel Gonzalez
made a televised appeal Thursday afternoon for Americans to urge
Reno and Clinton to act quickly.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a Republican, urged
Clinton to pursue a mediated agreement in the case. However,
mediation appeared unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall Coffey, an attorney for the Miami relatives, said they
have asked the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for supervised
mediation in the case. The court urged both sides Wednesday to
voluntarily submit the four-month-old dispute to its mediation
services, but did not order that.
</P>
<P>
   Justice officials were willing to see a mediator used if both
sides agreed to it for the purpose of discussing how, not whether,
Elian would be transferred to his father's custody. But they said
they had not heard the family drop its demand to debate whether a
transfer should occur.
</P>
<P>
   An option of seeking a federal court order to reinforce Reno's
directive to turn over Elian remained technically alive but had
little support among senior Justice officials, some said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If necessary, the attorney general is prepared to use law
enforcement,'' Justice spokeswoman Florman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have always been three trains moving simultaneously down
the track -- negotiations for a transfer, litigation and law
enforcement,'' Florman said. ''We are no longer in the engineer's
seat on the negotiation train. That's not the train we're
driving.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Florman said, ''The doors are always going to be
open to the family for a negotiated settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11th Circuit has ordered Elian to remain in the United
States until the court decides whether he should get an asylum
hearing. A hearing was set for May 11.

<HEADLINE> Suspect Held in Pa. Train Deaths  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER NEWTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINKING SPRING, Pa. (AP) -- A man who police say was so enraged
at his former girlfriend that he pushed her car into the path of a
freight train was arrested and charged Friday with killing her, her
friend and two children.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems like there was an awful lot of bad luck involved on
the part of the victims,'' said state police Lt. Edward Snyder.
''If she had arrived just moments earlier, she might have been able
to pass across the tracks without any problem. As it was, she was
only several blocks away from a police station.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said Carlos Angel Diaz Santiago, 22, had argued with
Candace Wertz, 20, at a fast-food restaurant and then chased her in
his car at speeds of up to 90 mph for a half-hour Thursday
afternoon through this small town about 50 miles northwest of
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a desperate 911 call on her cell phone, the chase ended
when Santiago rear-ended her car at a railroad crossing as she
waited for a train to pass and then used his car to push her
vehicle onto the tracks, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The Norfolk Southern train smashed into the car, killing Wertz;
her 2-year-old son, John Michael Cortez; Cynthia Jacques, 22; and
her daughter Allissa, 2.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago fled and was arrested without incident Friday at a
house. It wasn't clear Friday afternoon whether he had a lawyer
yet.
</P>
<P>
   He was charged with four counts each of homicide and aggravated
assault. Police also took into custody another man who they say may
have been in the car with Santiago; he was not charged.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives and neighbors said Wertz was trying to flee an abusive
relationship. Police said Wertz had obtained a protective order
against Santiago, but it had expired.
</P>
<P>
   David Peterson, a 24-year-old mechanic who lived next door to
Wertz, said he often saw her come home with a bloody nose and
bruises on her face.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was horrible. Everyone knew about it and everyone tried to
talk to her about getting help,'' Peterson said. ''I wish we had
called police on any one of those nights, but we just thought that
she would handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wertz's relatives said she had wanted to move 80 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ''The relationship had lasted for five years, and she never took
his actions seriously enough,'' said Tammy Wertz, Candace Wertz's
sister-in-law. ''This guy isn't even the child's father, but she
just couldn't get away from him.''

<HEADLINE> Canadian Composer Applebaum Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Canadian composer Louis Applebaum, long
associated with the prestigious classical repertory company the
Stratford Festival, has died of cancer. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Applebaum died Thursday, according to an announcement by
Stratford, North America's largest classical repertory company.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Toronto on April 3, 1918, Applebaum began composing
music at 15 and studied at the University of Toronto before going

</P>
<P>
   He was nominated for an Academy Award in 1947 for the score for
the film, ''The Story of G.I. Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   Applebaum was the first director of the Stratford Festival music
department and created and ran the Stratford Music Festival. In his
43 seasons at Stratford, he wrote and conducted music for more than
75 productions.
</P>
<P>
   Applebaum also wrote hundreds of scores for radio, television
and film, along with ballet music and symphonic, chamber and choral
works.

<HEADLINE> NYC Firefighters Ignore Call  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- City officials are investigating a fire
company's decision to ignore a call because no one available at the
time had taken a training course to drive the fire engine.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Chief Peter Ganci did not comment on whether any
disciplinary action would be taken against the four firefighters
and one lieutenant from Engine Company 303 in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have five members of the New York City Fire Department with
a fire to respond to, and for whatever reason, contractually or
otherwise, they felt it was not necessary for them to respond,''
Ganci said Friday. ''For me, that was a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred Wednesday when the company's engine
driver, known as a chauffeur, was injured, Ganci said. The
department had asked another driver to substitute, but he did not
arrive by the time of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Ganci said most firefighters have driven the engines, but the
department prefers to use drivers who have undergone specialized
training.
</P>
<P>
   A dispatcher sent a nearby company to handle the blaze, which
was put out with only minor damage done to the building.

<HEADLINE> Hog Farming Profitable Again  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL PEARSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW COLUMBIA, Ill. (AP) -- More bacon on the menu at fast-food
restaurants is helping reverse a collapse in pork prices that drove
thousands of hog farmers out of business nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The pork industry is in the fourth month of a turnaround that
has hog farmers turning a profit for the first time since October
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've learned over the last few years just how frugally we can
exist,'' said Wayne Peugh, who has 1,200 sows on his farm in the
central Illinois town of Edelstein. ''Now it's time to see if we
can make some money again.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there are fears that falling slaughterhouse capacity
could spark a return to the ''hog crisis'' of 1997-99, pork
consumption is higher than it has been in two decades. Restaurant
demand alone for bacon and other pork products has increased 17
percent in the last year, according to the National Pork Producers
Council.
</P>
<P>
   That is critical because 64 percent of the nation's pork is
served through restaurants, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the restaurants driving the demand are Burger King,
Wendy's and Jack in the Box. The chains all introduced sandwiches
containing bacon last year.
</P>
<P>
   Hogs were selling for 47 cents a pound Friday at Peoria, Ill.,
down a few cents from recent highs but almost six times more than
the December 1998 low of 8 cents a pound. Producers need about 40
cents a pound to break even, according to economists.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to tell you it's wide open and we should all go
home and try to grow our business 10 percent,'' said Jeff Galle,
president of the Illinois Pork Producers Association. ''If we all
do that, we'll be right back where we started from.''
</P>
<P>
   Hog prices began to plummet in 1998 after increasing supply
driven by industry expansion met up with decreased capacity to
process pork due to slaughterhouse closings. In addition, the Asian
financial crisis and growing economic problems in Russia reduced
worldwide demand for meat.
</P>
<P>
   Prices farmers received plunged to historic lows and the loss of
about $6 billion in the value of U.S. hog farming.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers have since cut production by about 2 percent, and
domestic slaughtering plants that had been under contract to handle
some Canadian hogs are now focusing exclusively on U.S. animals,
said Cindy Cunningham of the National Pork Producers Council.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the general optimism, some in the industry are nervous.
An Iowa plant is scheduled to close in the next month, reducing
slaughter capacity by 2 percent. And there are fears that problems
with the U.S. economy could lower demand again or that a severe
drought would drive up the price of corn -- the main livestock feed
-- and could sabotage the meat market.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's still a sense of dread out there,'' Peugh said.
''These scars run deep.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, producers are approaching the upturn cautiously,
said Kevin Logeman of New Columbia, who has about 700 sows on his
southern Illinois farm.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're making money but not enough to get caught up,'' he said.
''We all put on a lot of debt in those two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Logeman is one of many hog farmers in Illinois, the nation's No.
4 pork-producing state, who are turning to new business models to
buffer themselves from the kind of economic hurricane that forced
about 500 Illinois producers out of business last year.
</P>
<P>
   He is on the board of a new farmer's cooperative that plans to
build its own packing plant and market finished pork to consumers
under a new brand name, ''Meadowbrook Farms.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to have some control over my own destiny,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Amato Takes on Public Role in Italy  </HEADLINE>
By VICTOR L. SIMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Giuliano Amato, in line to become the next Italian
premier, first came into the public spotlight as a canny political
risk-taker during the corruption scandals of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Long a consummate behind-the-scenes operator, Amato, now 61,
became premier during a stormy 10-month period in 1992-1993,
presiding over a coalition rocked by scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Amato's personal probity has never been questioned, however, and
in his post he was able to push through the toughest austerity plan
since the rebuilding years in Italy after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will pack my bags,'' he warned lawmakers at the time, in a
successful move to overcome their reluctance and win passage of $33
billion in spending cuts and $39 billion in new taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ''Dr. Subtle,'' both for his slender frame and
considerable skills, he also devalued the lira during a currency
crisis, then pulled the Italian currency out of the European grid.
</P>
<P>
   Amato did not come under investigation during that stormy era,
when members of his Socialist Party and its allies were dogged by
inquiries begun by Milan's ''Clean Hands'' prosecutors in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Those investigations eventually uncovered a well-oiled system in
which businessmen gave money to politicians or the party in
exchange for deals with the sprawling state economy.
</P>
<P>
   Questions linger about how much Amato knew about kickbacks,
since he headed the office of Socialist premier Bettino Craxi, who
served until 1987 and ever afterwards held considerable influence.
Craxi died in Tunisia last year, refusing to return to Italy to
face corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers said that former anti-corruption prosecutor Antonio
Di Pietro, now a senator, refuses to support Amato.
</P>
<P>
   While Italy does not face the same deep economic or corruption
crisis, Amato will now have to navigate through political perils.
</P>
<P>
   Currently Italy's treasury minister, Amato was the unanimous
choice of a center-left coalition smarting after a humiliating
defeat in regional elections last weekend and trying to stave off a
national election a year ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The 61-year-old was the choice of the center-left to succeed
Massimo D'Alema, the first former Communist ever to lead an Italian
government who resigned earlier this week to pay the price for the
election defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Still angry conservative opposition, claiming the center-left
had lost its political legitimacy, demands an immdiate election.
</P>
<P>
   Media mogul Silvio Berlusconi said any candidate taking over
from D'Alema would be no more than a ''useful idiot'' used by the
left to keep the coalition in power.
</P>
<P>
   Amato, now an independent, studied law at the University of Pisa
and received a master's degree in comparative law at Columbia Law
School in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike D'Alema, he speaks fluent English. He has been mentioned
through the years as a candidate for such posts as European Union
president, NATO secretary-general and governor of the European
Central Bank.

<HEADLINE> Unmanned Spy Plane Makes Test Run  </HEADLINE>
By BILL KACZOR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EGLIN AIR FORCE BASE, Fla. (AP) -- The Air Force's newest spy
plane landed here Friday on its first deployment from its home base
in California -- but no pilot got out of the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   The $25 million Global Hawk, still in the demonstration phase,
does not even have a cockpit. It's an unmanned aerial vehicle, or
UAV, that can fly on its own for up to 35 hours as high as 65,000
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Its missions will be those that are too ''dull, dirty and
dangerous'' to risk a pilot, said Col. Craig R. McPherson, program
director for the Global Hawk at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ''You shoot this down and you have a smoking hole in the
ground,'' McPherson said. ''But you haven't lost the pilot. The
last thing you want to do is have the pilot paraded down the main
street of a Kosovo-type of environment.''
</P>
<P>
   On its way to the Florida Panhandle from Edwards Air Force Base,
Calif., Global Hawk No. 4 transmitted pictures of boats in the Gulf
of Mexico for the Coast Guard to demonstrate its potential for the
interdiction of drugs and other contraband.
</P>
<P>
   While at Eglin, the glider-like UAV, which has a 116-foot
wingspan, will take part in two military exercises.
</P>
<P>
   Global Hawks are made by the Ryan Aeronuatical Center of
Northrop Grumman in San Diego, although final assembly is going to
be moved to Palmdale, Calif., said Carl Johnson, the company's
Global Hawk program director.
</P>
<P>
   Two more Global Hawks will be delivered later this year. Two
more should be completed in 2003 and the Air Force plans to acquire
two each year from then on until it has as many as 48.

<HEADLINE> Voters Less Informed With Candidates  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN POPE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Now that Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice
President Al Gore have wrapped up their parties' nominations, it
appears voters are forgetting what they had learned about the
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Voters are now less familiar with where candidates stand on
issues than they were two months ago, says a poll released Friday
by the Joan Shorestein Center on the Press, Politics and Public
Policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''One might expect citizens to become better informed as the
campaign progresses toward November, but that's not what's
happening,'' said Thomas Patterson, a professor at Harvard's John
F. Kennedy School of Government and co-director of the Vanishing
Voter Project, which conducted the poll.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, voters are forgetting what they learned about the
candidates during the height of the primary season, when coverage
of the races dominated the news.
</P>
<P>
   After February's New Hampshire primary, 24 percent of voters
knew that Bush is opposed to mandatory gun registration. Now that
percentage has fallen to 13 percent. The number of people who knew
Gore opposes vouchers -- or using tax dollars to help parents pay
for their children to attend private or parochial school-- fell from
19 percent to 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The center has surveyed 1,000 adults a week since November to
track familiarity with the candidates' stances on a single issue,
but it started adding more issues in this week's poll. The poll has
an error margin of plus or minus 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, interest in the campaign also declined sharply
once the primary battles were over, the surveys found. The center's
''Voter Involvement Index,'' which measures how closely voters are
following the race in the media and how often they are thinking and
talk about it, peaked on March 12 -- just days after the Super
Tuesday primaries -- then fell this week to its lowest levels since
the first week in January.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson said he was surprised by the size of the declines, but
he said the cause is clear: a front-heavy primary schedule that
decided the parties' nominees eight months before the election.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson says voters might know more about the candidates if
the election season were shorter, saying:
</P>
<P>
   ''A shorter, non-interrupted campaign would be from the public's
perspective a more informative campaign.''

<HEADLINE> Father Urged To Speak For Elian  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba's justice minister said Friday that
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez has no right to seek political asylum and
U.S. officials should act quickly to reunite him with his father.
</P>
<P>
   ''A minor of that age does not have the mental, or of course the
legal capacity for a political decision of that nature,'' Roberto
Diaz Sotolongo said in an interview with The Associated Press.
''The son has to speak through the mouth of his father.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta on Wednesday issued
a ruling suggesting that U.S. officials should take the Cuban
child's wishes into account. That was the latest dramatic
development in the legal process that has kept Elian in the United
States since he was rescued from a shipwreck that killed his mother
in late November.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz Sotolongo said the U.S. government has failed to swiftly
enforce its own rulings in the case that Elian belongs with his
father.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would have liked that there was much more prompt action...
The declarations of the (U.S.) government have been in accordance
with the law. What has been lacking ... is the quickness in taking
a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The minister's comments were in line with Cuban government
statements, but far more measured than comments at mass rallies,
where speakers have ridiculed the delay in removing Elian from the
great-uncle in Miami who is fighting to keep the child in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   At a nationally televised rally Thursday, Communist student
leader Hassan Perez labeled great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez a ''vulgar
and common delinquent.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can you explain that the attorney general of that country
is trembling'' to demand the law be carried out, Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta court decision barred Elian from returning to Cuba
until resolution of a legal battle over his Miami relatives'
attempts to seek political asylum for him.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not impede the boy's return to his father's
custody, pending ''whatever other process,'' Diaz Sotolongo noted.
U.S. officials have taken the same position on the court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he would do in the place of U.S. Attorney General
Janet Reno, who is responsible for carrying out the law and faces a
potentially explosive situation around the Miami house, he
insisted, ''there are sufficient means to ensure compliance.... the
normal ones that are used in such cases.''

<HEADLINE> The Nation's Weather  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   A slow-moving storm system lumbered from the nation's
midsection
to the Northeast on Friday with widespread rain and thunderstorms,
while clear to partly cloudy skies prevailed over the Gulf Coast
states back through the Mississippi Valley into the Plains.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The center of a low pressure area continued to spin over Ohio,
as a warm front stretched east from the low pressure into New
Jersey and a cold front extended south into westerain parts of South
Carolina and easterain Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   In southwest Ohio, the fast-moving storm toppled trees and road
signs from Dayton to Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   In Dayton, the winds took down power lines, caused a few minor
fires in a residential neighborhood, and knocked trees onto the
roofs of an apartment building and a home. A tree was blown over
onto a van in Huber Heights, and a pickup truck in Fairborain was
crushed by a falling tree. There were no injuries.
</P>
<P>
   About 12,000 Dayton Power &AMP; Light customers lost power when the
storm rolled through. By Friday afterainoon, power had been restored
to all but 500 customers.
</P>
<P>
   Rain pelted New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey as well as New
England, where flash flood watches were in effect into Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Rochester and Dunkirk in New York and Erie, Pa., saw more than
an inch of rainfall between Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms also ranged from easterain Maryland into
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   From the Gulf Coast states through the Mississippi Valley into
the Plains, skies were clear to partly cloudy. Some high clouds
spread east into parts of the westerain Plains, primarily from
westerain Nebraska south into Texas. These clouds came with a
developing storm system over the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   The storm system also brought widespread clouds from Nevada,
Utah and Colorado south into southerain Califorainia, Arizona and New
Mexico. Only a few spotty showers hit these areas.
</P>
<P>
   A cold front approaching the Pacific Northwest Coast brought
increasing clouds to coastal areas of Washington and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures in the Lower 48 Friday ranged from 82 degrees in
Del Rio, Texas, to 18 in Eveleth, Minn.

Three stained-glass church windows stolen
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- A 20-year-old man has been charged with
stealing three stained-glass window panes worth about $4,500 from a
94-year-old Methodist church.
</P>
<P>
   The man, whose identity was not disclosed, was arrested
Wednesday after police said they got an anonymous tip. By late
Friday, two of the 32-by-13-inch windows had been recovered and
returned to the church.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect was charged with fourth-degree grand burglary, a
felony, and others were being sought for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   The windows were stolen from the ground level of Grace United
Methodist Church. One was taken the night of April 4 and the others
vanished the next night. Each was valued at around $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Ida Miller, the church's pastor for 12 years, was upset
about the theft, but not unforgiving.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was hopeful the church could make contact with the
thief ''and see what can be done to meet this person's need and
maybe be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   ''The person is always more important than the window, as
precious as the windows are to us,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Red Cross workers plan to strike  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA TOMMELLEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRITAIN, Conn. (AP) -- A threatened strike by nearly 200
American Red Cross workers in Connecticut could drop the daily
collection rate of blood in the state by about 80 percent, the
agency said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The workers plan to strike May 1 if their demands, which include
improved schedules and benefits, are not met.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not want a strike. This unit does not look forward to
striking and walking a picket line and sacrificing their salaries
and putting their families in jeopardy,'' said Mike Ferrucci Jr.,
executive director of the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees, Council 4.
</P>
<P>
   The union currently is negotiating a three-year contract with
the state branch of the American Red Cross Blood Services. The
Connecticut chapter, headquartered in Farmington, runs several
blood donation drives daily around the state. There were a total of
14 scheduled for Friday and Saturday from Danielson to Fairfield.
</P>
<P>
   In the event of a strike, the agency plans to hold only one
blood drive a day, reducing its usual daily collection from 600
pints to about 125 pints, said agency spokeswoman Lynn Townshend.
</P>
<P>
   She said the drives will be staffed by management and ''any
union worker who wants to join us.'' Townshend said the state
branch does have as a backup the resources of the National Red
Cross blood collection system.
</P>
<P>
   But during a news conference Friday, union officials said they
don't expect any unionized worker to cross the picket line.
</P>
<P>
   The employees include technician-drivers, nurses, phlebotomists
and lab workers. They say the main sticking point is one more of
respect than wages. They often work long hours, have daily changing
schedules and are asked to pay more of their health benefits. The
pay ranges from $10 to $22 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Pelkey, an 11-year worker one of 33 driver-technicians,
said some employees can be at work anywhere from 3 a.m. to 10 p.m.
on any given day to set up blood drives around the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a scheduling nightmare,'' said Pelkey. ''There is no such
thing as a set pattern of hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelkey, who also is the president of the union's local unit,
said workers also are looking for some respect. The turnover rate
is about 25 percent, according to the union.
</P>
<P>
   ''We continually work our best to get the blood drives up on
time,'' he said. ''There's never any 'attaboys'. It's always 'you
did something wrong.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He said Connecticut's Red Cross unit is one of the best in the
nation in terms of quantity of blood collected and its safety
record.
</P>
<P>
   ''I take pride in my job because I know I'm helping people in
Connecticut,'' said Pelkey. ''When I started at the Red Cross, I
thought this is the greatest place to be. You were doing such a
humanitarian service.''
</P>
<P>
   The union on Thursday filed a 10-day notice as required by
federal law of their intent to strike. A federal mediator has been
brought in, but no meetings between the two sides had been
scheduled as of Friday, said Jeff Jump, union negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   ''The (Red Cross) position is that it's tough on managment to do
the proper scheduling with all the variations. And we're the ones
that bear the brunt of that,'' said Jump. ''It's a heck of a way to
live.''
</P>
<P>
   But the agency contends it has made a fair and generous offer to
the union negotiating team. A strike would not affect Connecticut's
blood supply, but a prolonged strike could ''seriously affect the
region's ability to collect and distribute blood,'' the agency said
in a statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have been negotiating since February. The current
contract expired March 1.
</P>
<P>
   The last strike against the agency was in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ''The public safety is at stake here and management acts like
anyone can do the job,'' said Jump. ''Does John Q. Public want
'just anyone' handling the nation's blood supply?''

<HEADLINE> Davidians: FBI Ignored Offer  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE MITTELSTADT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI ignored a California company's offer
of remote-controlled armored firefighting equipment less than two
weeks before the deadly fire that ended the 1993 Waco siege, Branch
Davidians said in a court filing Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's on-scene commanders also did little to prepare for the
possibility of fire despite Attorney General Janet Reno's directive
that they be ready for all emergency contingencies, the plaintiffs
said as part of their wrongful-death lawsuit against the
government.
</P>
<P>
   They point to a memo jotted down in the FBI's Washington command
center 10 days before the siege's fiery end advising that the two
on-scene commanders had decided ''there would be no plan to fight a
fire should one develop in the Davidian compound.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 Branch Davidians died during the inferno that
consumed their flimsy wooden retreat on April 19, 1993, several
hours into an FBI tear-gassing operation intended to end the 51-day
siege.
</P>
<P>
   The local volunteer fire department's personnel and fire trucks
were kept away from the burning building -- a decision that FBI
special agent in charge Jeffrey Jamar told Congress he made out of
concern that the firefighters could be hit by Davidian gunfire or
exploding ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   But the plaintiffs, in a 58-page motion made public Friday that
will be filed in federal court in Waco, Texas, say the FBI ignored
an offer made by a California company -- Flamechek International --
to lend the government a Soviet T-55 combat tank reconfigured as
armored firefighting equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Flamechek's owner, Mira Slovak, told plaintiffs' lawyers in a
deposition last month that he called an FBI office in California a
week to 10 days before the siege's fiery end to offer the
remote-controlled equipment. Slovak said he followed up the
bureau's request for more information by providing brochures and
tank specifications but never heard back from the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Former FBI Assistant Director Larry Potts and other high-ranking
officials testified during recent depositions that they were told
such firefighting equipment didn't exist and that they knew nothing
of the Flamechek offer. ''Never heard of that,'' Potts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was my understanding that (armored firefighting equipment)
didn't exist,'' said Richard Rogers, who headed the FBI's Hostage
Rescue Team at Waco. He testified he first heard of Flamechek's
offer last month.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs aren't focusing only on the armored equipment.
They also argue that the FBI commanders were derelict in not
exploring other options such as water cannons or helicopters with
water buckets.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most fitting assessment of the FBI's pathetic performance
on this issue remains the comment of Stuart Gerson, acting attorney
general before the confirmation of Janet Reno: 'Think about fire
next time,''' the motion says.
</P>
<P>
   The government has asked the federal judge presiding over the
case to throw out the plaintiffs' claims relating to the fire,
saying the FBI leaders' decisions are covered under a discretionary
authority protection.
</P>
<P>
   ''The discretionary function exception protects policy-grounded
judgment or choice,'' the Justice Department said in a court filing
earlier this month. ''Even if the on-scene commanders were
negligent or abused their discretion by deciding not to have
armored fire trucks -- or any other specific equipment -- available,
those decisions would fall within the exception.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has long contended the Davidians themselves
torched their retreat and caused their own deaths, whether by fire
or gunshot.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit heads to trial in mid-June.

<HEADLINE> Body pulled from river identified as missing Collingswood woman  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLINGSWOOD, N.J. (AP) -- A body found floating in the Cooper
River was identified Friday as that of a woman abducted from her
apartment in December.
</P>
<P>
   It took a forensic dentist to identify the remains of Chia Yen
''Ann'' Hsu, 30, of Collingswood, whose nude, bound body remained
submerged in the Cooper River for more than four months.
</P>
<P>
   The condition of the body made it impossible for Camden County
Medical Examiner Robert J. Segal and Haskell Askin, the forensic
dentist who identified her, to establish a cause of death beyond
saying Hsu was murdered.
</P>
<P>
   Hsu's body was spotted floating in the Camden river by two
passers-by Thursday. She had been missing since disappearing from
her first-floor apartment in what authorities say was a brutal,
random attack.
</P>
<P>
   Her hands and feet were bound with electrical cords and a
telephone cord taken from her apartment, according to First
Assistant Camden County Prosecutor James P. Lynch. An autopsy
performed Friday showed multiple skull fractures around the
forehead, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said the skull fractures were inflicted before the body
was submerged, but it wasn't clear whether she died before she
entered the river.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have already charged Rodney Bullock, 20, with
robbing, raping and dumping Hsu in the river. She was last seen
alive Dec. 7.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are no words to describe how painful and horrifying this
experience has been,'' said Hsu family friend Andy McLaughlin, who
read a statement prepared by the woman's family. ''Ann will always
be with us in our minds and hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   Hsu was reported missing after she failed to show up at her job.
Police found her apartment ransacked, the telephone line cut and
evidence of forced entry and robbery. Her black 1998 Honda Civic
was also missing.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock, of Camden, was captured in North Carolina, where he was
seen driving Hsu's car. He reportedly confessed to authorities, but
Lynch would not confirm that Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A transient high-school dropout with a criminal record that
included drug and burglary charges, he is charged with murder,
kidnapping, aggravated sexual assault and burglary.
</P>
<P>
   He is 5-foot-8 inches tall and weighs 210 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Hsu, a Drexel University graduate who worked as a consultant in
Bala Cynwyd, Pa., and was engaged to be married, was 5-3, 108
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope you'll share in our memory of Ann by appreciating each
other more as well,'' McLaughlin said, reading from the family's
statement at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock's case is awaiting presentment to a grand jury. No
decision has been made on whether to seek the death penalty, Lynch
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 27, the family held an emotional two-hour memorial
ceremony for Hsu. No new service is planned, according to
McLaughlin.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the body closed the book on what was a painful
chapter for investigators and volunteers who helped search for Hsu
in the weeks after her disappearance, Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one of these cases you take with you,'' Police Chief
Thomas Garrity told The Courier-Post of Cherry Hill in Friday's
editions. ''This is a day we have been waiting for to hopefully
bring some closure.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Offers Gun Issue Compromise  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton offered a compromise Friday
on background checks for gun purchases, a move he called ''a
gesture of good faith'' designed to revive negotiations with
Congress on his stalled gun safety legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill.,
Clinton proposed retaining records from background checks for 90
days, rather than the current 180 days.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a gesture of good faith, I am willing to meet you halfway
on this important issue,'' Clinton said. I hope this step will help
break the current logjam, and bring your colleagues back to the
conference table.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, away from Congress for the Easter holiday recess, was not
immediately available for comment. However, the National Rifle
Association said Clinton's proposal was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ''The law specifically states that the records are to be
destroyed,'' said NRA spokesman Bill Powers. ''Once a lawful
citizen has been cleared through this check, it should not be the
federal government's business to be keeping files.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposed legislation tightening restrictions on guns
last year, shortly after two teen-agers shot 13 people and
themselves to death at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   A House-Senate conference committee has been assigned to
reconcile differences between a Senate-passed version that would
set a 72-hour background check on gun-show sales and a House bill
that shrank the wait to 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   But the committee has met only once, in August, and Senate
Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has not scheduled another
meeting. Clinton has blamed the delay on pressure tactics from the
NRA. In turn, the NRA accused the Clinton administration of being
too lax in enforcing current gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the president made road trips to support state-based
gun measures in Maryland and Colorado, and Hyde suggested that
background check waiting periods apply to potential gun buyers with
unresolved arrest records or a history of drug use, mental
incapacity, domestic violence or stalking.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Clinton discounted Hyde's proposal, saying he
feared it would create new loopholes through which criminals could
purchase guns. ''Neither of us is interested in a compromise that
would serve only to jeopardize public safety and the effectiveness
of law enforcement,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president also said he is dismayed that Congress did not act
on his proposed gun restrictions by the one-year anniversary of the
Columbine shootings, which was Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We owe it to the families of Littleton, and the thousands more
who lose their lives in gunfire each year in America, to get this
done now,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Leader Wants Cease-Fire  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- The Kremlin on Friday played down the
Chechen president's reported call for a cease-fire, saying he has
little authority over the rebels fighting Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
   Although fighting in the republic has slowed in recent weeks,
the Russian military said Friday it flew more than 40 combat
missions over Chechnya in the past 24 hours and reported small
skirmishes on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   In one, Russian soldiers wiped out a small caravan of rebels
transporting supplies on horses through the rugged southern
mountains, the federal command said. Troops also killed a group of
rebels northwest of Grozny, the Chechen capital, but further
details were not available, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said in an interview published
Friday in the newspaper Kommersant that the recent lull was due to
his ordering militants to halt fighting and said the order was part
of trying to reach a peaceful settlement of the war.
</P>
<P>
   However, Maskhadov is at odds with many rebel commanders and
Russian officials say only a few hundred fighters answer to him --
about 10 percent of the rebel force. Russian officials also denied
that Maskhadov had coordinated the cease-fire with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ''The so-called peace initiatives put forward by Aslan Maskhadov
are not backed by anything. He has no power to realize them,'' said
Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the Kremlin's main spokesman on Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maskhadov is one of many field commanders of whom,
unfortunately, we have plenty in Chechnya,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia recently has indicated it is seeking a political way out
of the war, saying that it was in contact with Maskhadov through
intermediaries and that he could qualify for amnesty even though he
is charged with abetting armed rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin said he was prepared for talks
with Maskhadov, but only if he gets the rebels to surrender.
Maskhadov is unlikely to be able to ensure such a capitulation.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov said in the interview that practically all of the
rebels in Chechnya were under his command, ''and they certainly
follow my orders.''
</P>
<P>
   Yastrzhembsky said intelligence reports confirm Maskhadov's lack
of control. One intercepted radio report, he said, included warlord
Shamil Basayev saying he would ''not continue to tolerate him if he
makes more peaceful statements.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces are taking advantage of the lull in fighting to
regroup in southern and southeastern Chechnya, while the rebels
attempt to restore communications among their scattered groups, the
military command told Interfax.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops who entered Chechnya in September took about
two-thirds of the republics in the first months of the war, but
have stalled in trying to dislodge the rebels from the southern
mountains, the last major area still under Chechen control.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a trio of European Union ambassadors who visited
Chechnya on Friday said Russia must provide much more money to
restore the republic.
</P>
<P>
   ''To say that it is enough is laughable,'' Portuguese Ambassador
Pacheco Luiz-Gomes said of current funding.
</P>
<P>
   French Ambassador Hubert Colin de Verdiere said the Russian
envoy to Chechnya, Nicolai Koshman, told the three that it was
''not a priority to rebuild Grozny. The cost of restoration of
Grozny is so high that it would have been enough to restore all
Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States has sharply criticized Russia for the
Chechnya campaign, de Verdiere said the EU is not considering
sanctions against Russia. The EU is willing to organize
humanitarian aid and to provide support to medical facilities and
to refugees, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The third ambassador was EU envoy to Moscow Gilbert DuBois.

<HEADLINE> Man in Drag Steals Wedding Dress  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW PORT RICHEY, Fla. (AP) -- If the ladies at Cluttered Closet
ever read a wedding announcement that says the bride wore
blue-striped boxers, they'll know they've found their thief.
</P>
<P>
   The shop reported to police that a 360-pound red-haired man
dressed in women's clothing took a size 24 wedding dress. The $399
dress was probably slipped out of a bathroom door while the man,
and two other friends dressed in drag, perused the shop.
</P>
<P>
   The big bride-to-be had come to the shop several weeks ago and
tried on the dress on with the help of store owner Traci Laduke.
Laduke noticed the man's blue and white stripped boxers during the
fitting. It didn't fit -- the dress would only zip to the waist.
</P>
<P>
   ''He commented that he didn't have the right undergarments on,''
Laduke said.
</P>
<P>
   The man and one of his friends returned to the shop on Thursday
and tried on some more dresses, a Pasco County Sheriff's report
said. When they left, another clerk at the store noticed the
wedding dress was missing.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I see them on the street, I know who they are,'' Laduke
said.

<HEADLINE> Auction House Suit Named Class-Action  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge agreed Friday to give class-action
status to lawsuits alleging that Sotheby's and Christie's auction
houses conspired to manipulate prices they were paid by sellers and
buyers for at least seven years.
</P>
<P>
   The number of plaintiffs who have filed lawsuits alleging
antitrust violations ''arguably is alone sufficiently numerous to
justify class-action treatment,'' U.S. District Judge Lewis A.
Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Moreover, the strong likelihood is that the class numbers in
the thousands, if not tens of thousands,'' the Manhattan judge
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's did not oppose the request for class-action status.
Christie's did oppose the request, arguing that class-action status
is inappropriate in what is primarily a damages case.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer and a spokeswoman for Christie's declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Alan Reiss, a lawyer for Sotheby's, said, ''Our view is
that for reasons of efficiencies, it makes a lot of sense to have
this litigated in one court and that's why we didn't oppose it.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is whether there was collusion between the auction
houses that control 95 percent of the $4 billion worldwide auction
market, dominating the U.S. market for auctions of fine and applied
arts, furniture, antiques, automobiles, collectibles and other
items.
</P>
<P>
   In numerous lawsuits, individuals alleged that the auction
houses since Jan. 1, 1993 have agreed to charge buyers the same
rates and since 1995 have agreed to charge the same rates for the
commission sellers must pay.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the auction houses allegedly agreed to stop the
previous practice of negotiating the amounts of sellers'
commissions with some of their customers.
</P>
<P>
   The class certified by Kaplan includes everyone who bought or
sold items from the auction houses between Jan. 1, 1993 and Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
   The auction houses have said they are cooperating with
prosecutors in a Justice Department investigation that began in
1997.

<HEADLINE> Last World Bank Protesters Released  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The last of the World Bank protesters left
jail Friday night after a plea bargain was reached.
</P>
<P>
   ''The deal was all these charges are papered down to the very
lowest charge on the face of the earth, jaywalking,'' said Mike
Madden, a lawyer representing the demonstrators. He said each would
be fined $5.

   About 150 were behind bars at the District of Columbia jail most

<P>
   Some had claimed they were mistreated in the jail but city
officials denied that.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been no incidents in the jail regarding these

that the protesters were kept together in a separate unit of the
jail, away from the regular prison population.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks $200M Africa Aid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton asked Congress on Friday to
provide $200 million in emergency funding for countries in southern
Africa. Most of the funding would go to Mozambique, where flooding
has left at least 700 dead and hundreds of thousands homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's request includes $131 million for Mozambique to repair
and reconstruct roads and rail lines and rehabilitate farm areas
and health and education services. The request also would restore
the Defense Department's authority to use $37.5 million in existing
accounts to finance humanitarian relief operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''While Mozambique continues to make great efforts to sustain
its fledging democracy and its program of market reforms, it is
still one of the world's poorest countries,'' Clinton said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear how Clinton's request would be
received in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
decided to indefinitely postpone votes scheduled by the Senate
Appropriations Committee on an overall emergency spending package
that includes money for combating drugs in Columbia and
peacekeeping in Kosovo. Lott, whose office was closed for the
Easter holiday recess, supports the spending but doesn't see a need
to consider the legislation on an emergency basis as the House did.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's request also includes:
</P>
<P>
   --$17 million for Madagascar to fix and improve road and rail
lines and telecommunication systems, solve water quality problems
and support economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   --$16 million for flood-control and disaster preparedness for the
region and improve southern Africa's ability to respond to future
disasters.
</P>
<P>
   --$15 million for South Africa for schools, health centers and
problems in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   --$10 million to fund water and sanitation projects, buy seeds
and tools and make small repairs to infrastructure in Mozambique,
Madagascar and Botswana.
</P>
<P>
   --$4 million for Zimbabwe, Zambia and Botswana to repair houses
and infrastructure, treat water and prepare for disasters.

<HEADLINE> Pope Hears Good Friday Confessions  </HEADLINE>
By DANIELA PETROFF, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Pope John Paul II led a torch-lit procession around
the ancient Roman Colosseum on Good Friday, leaning on a wooden
cane as he marked Christ's suffering and death on one of
Christianity's most solemn days.
</P>
<P>
   While the pope used to carry a wooden cross for the entire,
half-mile Colosseum procession, after hip surgery a few years ago
he began covering only a stretch of the way with the cross to
commemorate Jesus' suffering on the way to crucifixion. The pope
turns 80 on May 18.
</P>
<P>
   After holding the cross during the first pause for prayer, the
pope, wearing red and white vestments, handed it off in succession
to a Roman family, a Chinese woman, and a young African boy who
lives in a refugee camp in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a grueling Holy Week schedule that included two Masses
on Thursday, as well as confessions of the public and an afternoon
liturgy earlier Friday, John Paul seemed to hold up well during the
Colosseum ceremony, his voice strong and his pace determined. The
event was televised live in many parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The holy week culminates with Easter Sunday Mass in St. Peter's
Square, followed by a papal blessing from the central balcony of
the recently restored basilica, when the Pope will also deliver
Easter greetings in more than 50 languages. Over 100,000 people are
expected to flock to the Easter appearance, one of the highlights
of the Jubilee year celebrating 2000 years since the birth of
Christ.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 50,000 pilgrims and tourists, many of them carrying
small torches, converged on the Colosseum, site of some of the
first Christian martydoms at the hands of the Romans, for Friday's
nighttime liturgy.
</P>
<P>
   In brief remarks after the procession, the pope stressed the
contemporary message of the sufferings of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who, if not the crucified son of God, can know the sorrow and
loneliness of so many lives shattered and without a future?'' the
pope said.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul, who is also a poet, playwright and best-selling
author, personally wrote the prayers and meditations that
accompanied the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   It is not ''enough to to wash one's hands,'' the pope said,
referring to the gesture of Pontius Pilate that eventually led to
the crucifixion of Christ. ''Responsibility for the blood of the
just remains.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, in a special ceremony at the Vatican, John Paul
asked for forgiveness for the failings of his church over the
centuries, including its mistreatment of Jews and its violation of
the rights of ethnic groups.

<HEADLINE> N.C. City's Growth Hits Roadblock  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NOWELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- When the city ignored their faxes and
phone calls, 17 neighborhood opponents of a shopping center project
took Charlotte and the developer to court.
</P>
<P>
   To everyone's surprise, they won.
</P>
<P>
   Even more stunning, at least 50 projects -- from
multimillion-dollar shopping center expansions to apartment
buildings -- are on hold in one of the fastest-growing cities in
America.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Ben Tennille issued the ruling this week,
ordering the city to change how it makes about 80 percent of its
zoning decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said the city's fast-track, one-step rezoning process
needed to become a two-step procedure: First, changing a property's
zoning; then, approval of specific projects after a hearing with
City Council members serving as judges.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not here for fame and glory. We're protecting our
homes,'' said Judy Jeffries, one of the 17 homeowners who sued over
plans to rezone 42 acres nearby for the new shopping center.
</P>
<P>
   City attorneys said they should be able to overhaul the zoning
rules within 90 days. But in the meantime, developers will have to
mark time -- something they haven't done in Charlotte in a long
time.
</P>
<P>
   ''It throws into question the whole long-term development
process for Charlotte,'' said Walter Fields, a land-use consultant
and former city planner. ''Why would you spend money on a project
when you don't know a process is in place?''
</P>
<P>
   According to Fields, Charlotte rewrote its zoning rules in 1983
and 1991 specifically to eliminate trial-like hearings, which were
considered time-consuming and cumbersome.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, fast-track zoning has played a role in the boom that
has turned Charlotte into a major banking center and transportation
hub.
</P>
<P>
   The Charlotte metropolitan area, North Carolina's largest with
about 1 million residents, grew 25 percent between 1990 and 1999.
From 1988 to 1998, 7,838 new businesses arrived, creating more than
68,000 jobs and 76.2 million square feet of work space totaling $5
billion, according to the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Area Development magazine predicts Charlotte will become one of
the five fastest-growing U.S. metropolitan areas in the new
century. Demographers say Mecklenburg County will grow by 300,000
people over the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte is home to Bank of America, the country's
second-largest bank, and First Union, which is No. 6. Charlotte is
the biggest hub for US Airways, the sixth-largest airline in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Companies such as Duke Energy, Nucor Steel, SeaLand and Hearst
Corp. call Charlotte home. Large international companies like IBM
and Continental Tire have major operations here. And the city is
becoming a major center for customer-service operations for
companies like BellSouth and Vanguard.
</P>
<P>
   Its glittering skyline is a work in progress. Near the end of
1999, there were 28 buildings with 4.4 million square feet of space
under construction, including three hotels and 19- and 32-story
office towers. Yet Charlotte has one of the tightest office markets
in the nation with a multi-tenant vacancy rate of 9.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While boosters extol the virtues of Charlotte's blistering
growth, the boom has brought severe traffic jams and smog.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wouldn't bother a lot of people to sacrifice maximum growth
and development for quality development,'' said H.L. Owens, the
lawyer for the homeowners who fought the shopping center. As for
the developers, ''I don't think that means they will fail to make
money. It's a free country, but they don't have a right to grind
the middle class down to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Cox, an attorney for shopping center developer Albemarle
Land Co., said his clients are frustrated because they ''followed a
process they were told was legal, and now they are being told it
wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ''Charlotte is such a dynamic city that this will
be a bump in the road rather than a roadblock.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey Patrick, a lawyer who represents developers, initially
believed the ruling would drive investors elsewhere with their
money, but now he isn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ''The important thing is for the city to react as quickly as it
can,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Official Quits Before Talks  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A top official of South Korea's ruling
party resigned Friday for allegedly suggesting that Seoul
repatriate convicted North Korean spies, underlying the sensitivity
of relations between the two Koreas ahead of a historic summit.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation of Lee Jae-jung, chief policy-maker of the
Millennium Democratic Party, came a day before the rivals were to
begin talks at the border village of Panmunjom to discuss the
agenda for the first-ever summit by their leaders in June. The two
Koreas were divided at the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview published Thursday in Munhwa Ilbo, a South
Korean newspaper, Lee was quoted as saying that Seoul could
consider repatriating convicted North Korean spies as a goodwill
gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Ok-du, secretary-general of the ruling party, called Lee's
remarks ''inappropriate,'' saying that the issue is not under
consideration or study by his party or the government.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the two dozen spies were caught during or after the
1950-53 Korean War and are now free after serving prison terms.
However, they remain under protective watch for security reasons
and can't leave South Korea without special government permission.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Lee said their repatriation would be a
conciliatory gesture ahead of the summit and the 50th anniversary
of the outbreak of the Korean War on June 25.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, South Korea repatriated one convicted North Korean spy
across the border, hoping that it would lead to improved ties
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   But communist North Korea vehemently charged that the returned
spy became gravely sick because of torture in a South Korean
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Suggestions for further repatriations usually invited angry
protests and criticism from conservative groups and media in South
Korea. Lee's statements drew a similar reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ''We suspect that it's part of a secret deal made with North
Korea to hold the summit,'' said Lee Won-chang, spokesman for the
main opposition Grand National Party.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators at Saturday's planned meeting will try to set the
agenda for the June 12-14 summit in the North's capital of
Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   They'll begin fashioning a series of topics that could include
missile programs, the U.S. military presence in South Korea, aid
shipments to North Korea, rail links, joint business ventures,
liaison offices and the reunion of separated families.
</P>
<P>
   Both Koreas say reunification is their ultimate goal, but the
sides are expected to avoid focusing on that topic at the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Today, two populations that parted at the end of World War II,
and then fought a three-year war, share little more than
bloodlines. The North is poor and totalitarian. The South is rich
and democratic.

<HEADLINE> Gore Promotes 'Green' Credentials  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ridiculed as an environmental extremist who
wants to scrap the internal combustion engine, Vice President Al
Gore said on the eve of Earth Day that he wears such criticism as a
''badge of honor.'' Indeed, he said, the auto industry's new
technologies are proving him right.
</P>
<P>
   As the nation celebrates the 31st Earth Day on Saturday, Gore is
focusing anew on the environment, an issue on which his supporters
believe Republican presidential rival George W. Bush is especially
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, however, the Democratic candidate has not been able
to energize environmental activists behind his campaign. Public
opinion polls suggest that while almost everybody wants the
environment protected, people are more interested in such issues as
education, crime and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the vice president flew to the Detroit area, the
heart of America's automobile industry, to highlight the
development of super fuel-efficient engine technology for trucks.
Although not a campaign trip, it was a way for Gore to challenge
the talk of environmental extremism.
</P>
<P>
   He also took after Bush's environmental record, accusing his GOP
rival of ''playing politics with the polluters'' and after five
years as governor leaving Texas ''with the worst environment of any
state.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Texas is No. 1 in the nation for air, water and land
pollution. It's not healthy for people to put up with that,'' Gore
declared in an interview with CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who favors using tax breaks and other incentives to
encourage industry to develop pro-environment programs, said the
current regulatory system that ''dates back to the first Earth
Day'' needs an update.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States is entering a new era of environmental
policy that requires a new philosophy of public stewardship and
personal responsibility,'' Bush said in a statement distributed by
his campaign. ''Economic prosperity and environmental protection
can and must go hand in hand.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1992 book, ''Earth in the Balance,'' Gore wrote that it
ought to be possible to phase out the internal combustion engine
over 25 years and replace it with a propulsion system that does not
spew out millions of tons of carbon dioxide and other pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's critics have latched on to the proposed demise of the
revered engine, in use since before the days of Henry Ford's Model
T, as proof of extreme environmental thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ''I expected that criticism then and I wear it as a badge of
honor today,'' he declared at a motor freight yard in Romulus,
Mich., outside Detroit, where he announced a new
government-industry research effort aimed at tripling the fuel
economy of trucks. He now sees the development of cleaner, more
efficient engines ''in less than 25 years,'' he said, contending he
had been too conservative when he penned his book eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Few issues distinguish Gore and Bush as clearly as the
environment, according to activists and business executives alike.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has argued for ratification of a climate change treaty that
would require reductions in so-called greenhouse gases, saying it
can be done without jeopardizing economic growth through
development of more efficient automobiles and power plants. Bush
would dump the treaty, crafted in Kyoto, Japan, more than two years
ago, arguing it would devastate businesses and hinder economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
   While some environmentalists have criticized Gore for not moving
more aggressively to follow up on the Kyoto agreement, he remains
by far the environmental community's choice over Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''The clean air agenda has been largely his agenda,'' said Carl
Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club. ''And he gets credit
in having turned Bill Clinton into a real believer on climate
change. Bush has said he needs to be judged by Texas, and if you
judge him by Texas, the record is appalling.''
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, the Houston area, recorded its first smog violation
of the year, possibly an indicator of a summer of dirty air to
come. Last summer the Houston area, with 52 days of violations, for
the first time passed the Los Angeles basin as having the worst air
quality anywhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Texas also spews more toxic chemicals into the environment than
any other state, ranks 49th among all states in state resources for
parks, has been in sporadic fights with the federal government over
endangered species protection and, since Bush became governor, has
seen a spike in the number of dirty air days in eight of its major
metropolitan areas, including Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has blamed the smog problems, in part, on growth and
natural weather patterns and has vowed to work to get urban areas
into compliance with federal air quality requirements.
</P>
<P>
   While Texas emits the most toxic chemicals because of a
concentration of refineries and chemical plants, Dan Bartlett, a
Bush campaign spokesman, said the state also has led the nation in
the reduction of those releases, cutting them by 14 percent between
1995 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign also touts Bush's role in getting industry to make
voluntary cutbacks in air pollution, though environmentalists say
such plans fall short of what's needed.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Leader Mentions Reunifying  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan's newly elected leader expressed
interest Friday in considering a confederation with rival China -- a
relationship a visiting Chinese policy expert said Beijing would
surely reject.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a list of top Cabinet members in Taiwan's new
government was announced, featuring prominent numbers of women,
technocrats and academics who will be key in the push to improve
relations with China and clean up corruption.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important posts was given to Tsai Ying-wen, an
expert on international trade who will head the Mainland Affairs
Council, which handles China policy.
</P>
<P>
   Tsai, who could be on the front line in possible talks with
Beijing, may have been tapped for her experience in helping to
negotiate Taiwan's bid to join the World Trade Organization. Taiwan
and China are expected to enter the organization that regulates
global trade and will have to negotiate lifting five-decade-old
trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of repairing a 51-year China-Taiwan split by forming a
loose alliance between the two sides, similar to the British
Commonwealth, has been proposed before by Taiwanese thinkers. But
President-elect Chen Shui-bian has not been a vocal proponent of
the notion.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Chen showed flexibility on the issue and said that
creating a confederation might be a way to break the impasse
between China and Taiwan, which separated amid civil war in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   The issued was raised by elderly presidential adviser Sun
Yun-suan, whom Chen visited while making traditional courtesy calls
to influential figures in the current government.
</P>
<P>
   Chen said he did not have the power to single-handedly determine
the future of Taiwan and that there would have to be public
consensus before Taiwan pressed ahead in trying to establish a
confederation with the mainland. But he said it was an example of
''new thinking that could bring a breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen added, ''There's a lot of room for discussion of this
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   But Yu Keli, a Chinese scholar with close connections to the
Beijing government, told reporters that China would not agree to
forming a confederation because it wouldn't suit China's current
situation. Yu, who has been visiting Taiwan this week, did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Most polls say that the majority of Taiwanese do not favor
reunification with China as long as it is ruled by a repressive
communist government.
</P>
<P>
   Chen said there was a ''thick icy wall'' between Taiwan and
China, and he warned Beijing that continued threats would only make
relations more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the best way to break down the wall would be to rely
on the warmth of the sun to melt it,'' Chen said, urging Beijing to
use a softer approach.
</P>
<P>
   Since his election last month, Chen has tried to be flexible on
the China issue and has made several goodwill gestures. He has
offered to meet with Chinese leaders and discuss any topic.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has refused to meet with Chen unless he agrees that
Taiwan is an inseparable part of China. Taiwan won't accept the
condition, fearing that as a mere part of China the island wouldn't
be treated as an equal at the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-member Cabinet, picked by Chen and Premier-designate Tang
Fei, includes several members of the Nationalist Party, defeated by
Chen in last month's vote. Tang, the current defense minister, is a
Nationalist.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's small Democratic Progressive Party also won several
appointments. DPP Secretary-general Yu Shyi-kun was named vice
premier and lawmaker Yeh Chu-lan will be transportation minister.
</P>
<P>
   DPP lawmaker Chen Ting-nan will be the justice minister,
responsible for helping Chen keep his promise to clean up graft.
</P>
<P>
   But many other posts were assigned to independents and academics
in keeping with Chen's promise to establish a ''government for all
the people.''

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Guerrilla Killed in Attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Israeli forces carried out air attacks in
southern Lebanon on Friday against suspected guerrilla hideouts,
killing a Hezbollah fighter and wounding a 5-year-old boy,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks came as Egypt backed Lebanese claims for Israel to
pay compensations for damage done to Lebanon by hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese President Emile Lahoud and Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, meeting in Cairo, also called Israel's decision to
withdraw its 1,500 soldiers from Lebanon by July was ''a victory
for Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   In airstrikes continuing into the night, Israeli helicopter
gunships and planes blasted suspected guerrilla hideouts, killing a
Hezbollah fighter, Lebanese security officials and a Hezbollah
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese officials said an Israeli helicopter gunship fired a
missile that hit the center of Nabatiyeh, a market town 35 miles
south of Beirut. The missile did not explode but caused panic among
the residents.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli military officials denied any attack on the center of
Nabatiyeh.
</P>
<P>
   In a second incident, Israeli artillery shells wounded a boy, 5,
on a farm near Kfar Tibnit, a village about two miles southwest of
Nabatiyeh, Lebanese officials said. The boy was treated for
shrapnel wounds to his legs.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, said in a
statement his forces would ''continue to carry out initiated
actions against the terrorist groups in the air and on the
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel has occupied a zone in southern Lebanon since 1985 as a
buffer against cross-border guerrilla attacks, but has pledged to
withdrawal by July 7.
</P>
<P>
   At their meeting, Mubarak backed Lebanon's claims for Israel to
pay compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lebanon has the right to demand full compensation for the
damage caused by this occupation,'' a joint statement by the
presidents said.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Israeli warplanes, retaliating for troop losses,
destroyed three Lebanese power stations. Lebanon said repairs would
cost about $50 million.

Clinton, Gore Questioned on Fund-Raising

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As part of a long-running investigation into alleged
fund-raising abuses in the 1996 Clinton-Gore re-election campaign, federal
prosecutors interviewed President Clinton today. The White House said Vice
President Al Gore also was interviewed by the Justice Department Campaign
Finance Task Force this week. Clinton's interview was conducted under oath and
lasted four hours, said a White House official who spoke on condition of
anonymity. Attorney General Janet Reno established the task force to investigate
allegations that illegal foreign and corporate donations were made in the 1996
presidential campaign.

Justice spokeswoman Carole Florman. Florman would not identify the

suit against the other over the issue. Zurich American, which filed first,
contends Microsoft's liability insurance simply does not cover antitrust issues.
There are nearly 140 private antitrust suits that have been filed in 38 states

<HEADLINE> Gore Meets With Teamsters President  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROMULUS, Mich. (AP) -- On the 61st day, Al Gore ended the news
conference drought. In fact, he held two.
</P>
<P>
   In his first question-and-answer forum with reporters in two
months, the vice president took a few campaign shots at
presidential rival George W. Bush Friday and insisted -- in the
backyard of big-labor China opponents -- that he was making good on
his promise to push for permanent full trade relations with the
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also condemned as ''bad business'' a planned meeting --
organized by Michigan Gov. John Engler, an active Bush booster --
that will bring together state regulators and industry groups who
believe federal air-quality standards are too cumbersome.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Democratic state officials should stay away from
Thursday's gathering, Gore replied, ''I would if the stated purpose
of the meeting is to conspire with the regulated industries on how
to weaken the environmental laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours after he lunched with Teamsters president James Hoffa,
Gore was pressed to prove he was indeed lobbying members of
Congress for the Clinton-Gore administration's plan to give China
permanent normal trade status.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes. Yes I am,'' Gore said, not offering details.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa, who continues to withhold a Teamsters endorsement in the
presidential race, hotly opposes the trade measure, and Gore said
he spoke to the labor leader about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to go into my private conversations, but yes I
did and we disagree on it, also,'' Gore told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, who was on a part-official, part-campaign
trip to Michigan, spent 20 minutes taking about 20 questions in the
lobby of the Wyndham Garden Hotel, while hotel guests loudly rolled
luggage across the floor nearby.
</P>
<P>
   His second question-and-answer session with reporters came
abroad Air Force Two when he talked about being interviewed by a
Justice Department task force investigating alleged 1996
fund-raising abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing relaxed, Gore seemed determined not to repeat his
sweaty-browed 1997 press conference after the revelations first
broke and he repeatedly insisted there was ''no controlling legal
authority'' that prevented him from making fund-raising calls from
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''I volunteered to cooperate fully, as I have from the beginning
of their investigation,'' said Gore, who was questioned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As for whether the ongoing investigation might hurt his
presidential campaign, Gore told reporters, ''I have no feelings
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   He left the press cabin, but then returned in short order, this
time chewing on a snack and holding a coffee cup. No more
questions. Instead, Gore joked about his press secretary's recent
engagement and signed copies of the re-issue of his 1992 book,
''Earth in the Balance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee had been keeping a daily tally
of time elapsed since Feb. 19 when Gore last formally entertained
questions from the crew of reporters who travel with him.
</P>
<P>
   For Friday's occasion, the Gore campaign handed reporters
buttons that said: ''I was at Al Gore's first general-election
press conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore himself laughed off a question about when his next might
be. ''Oh my. It could be any moment.''
</P>
<P>
   He proved himself adept at sticking to his script.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when asked if he had any doubt that Elian
Gonzalez's father genuinely loves his 6-year-old son and wants him
home in Cuba, Gore responded with his usual answer: ''I still think
the standard should be what is in the best interests of the
child.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spent the bulk of his seven-hour visit to Michigan on the
chilly loading floor of the Alvan Motor Freight company, where he
beamed pre-Earth Day environmental pitches via satellite to nearly
a dozen TV news stations -- all of them in Midwest swing states.
</P>
<P>
   In the interviews and his news conference, he broke little new
ground, though he did say he has done nothing during the recent
days' developments on the Gonzalez case to press his own views
within the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno is waiting for law enforcement
officials to determine the best time and method to remove the Cuban
boy from the home of his Miami relatives and reunite him with his
father.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would recommend a different course to resolve it within the
family,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Political endorsement was not on the day's menu in Romulus,
about 30 miles outside Detroit, Hoffa told a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be a tough race for everyone. We're not making
any announcement about who we're going to endorse and not
endorse,'' Hoffa said. ''Everything in time.''
</P>
<P>
   His 1.4 million-member Teamsters, the largest of the AFL-CIO's
union affiliates, and the United Auto Workers have held out on
backing Gore, although the AFL-CIO endorsed Gore last year.

<HEADLINE> Britain Readies To Change Numbers  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLINE BYRNE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- That British stiff upper lip is trembling in the
face of a crisis of sorts: For the third time in a decade, the
telephone company is changing people's phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Given plenty of advance notice, London restaurants have changed
their menus and matchbooks yet again, and businesses have printed
new stationery and supplies. But the average phone user seems to
have opted for procrastination. Panic set in for some, just hours
before the big changeover of 11.5 million numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Only about four out of every 10 residents affected even know
their new number, said Kevin Read, spokesman for The Big Number,
the phone industry umbrella organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the people in the affected areas are panicking,'' said
Steve Littleton, a supervisor at The Big Number help center in
Bristol. The center is helping field the 150,000 inquiries flooding
in nationally each day.
</P>
<P>
   The change, which went into effect at 1 a.m. local time
Saturday, will alter phone numbers in London, four other British
cities and all of Northern Ireland, with many old numbers rendered
immediately invalid.
</P>
<P>
   Many customers were understandably annoyed when the latest
changes were announced. In 1990, London prefixes had changed from
01 to 071 or 081. Five years later, phone users were told to insert
an 01 in the prefix, thus changing London's to 0171 or 0181.
</P>
<P>
   This time the formula for figuring out the new number is more
complex. Area codes in inner and outer London will change from 0171
and 0181 to 0207 and 0208. Cardiff becomes 029, Coventry 024,
Portsmouth and Southampton 023, and Northern Ireland 028.
</P>
<P>
   New numbers also will be inserted between the new area code and
the old phone number. For example: An old inner London phone number
of 0171-555-5555 becomes 020-7555-5555 and an outer London
0181-555-5555 becomes 020-8555-5555.
</P>
<P>
   ''People just haven't got their head around how to use those
numbers,'' Read said.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the confusion, some old numbers will run in tandem
with the new numbers for varying periods of time. And there's more:
In April 2001, mobile phoners and pager numbers will be changed to
start with 07.
</P>
<P>
   OFTEL, the telecommunication industry's regulatory body, said
the changes are necessary to meet the massive growth in demand for
telephones, fax machines and Internet access. But a scathing report
by the government's Trade and Industry Select Committee last year
offered less than a ringing endorsement of the phone regulator.
</P>
<P>
   ''We find it inexcusable that a cost-benefit analysis was not
used by OFTEL to assess the impact of its current proposals for
changing telephone numbers,'' the committee concluded.

Teens Try To Deal With Violent High School Attack
</P>
<P>
   ORLEANS, Ontario (AP) -- There will be questions and anguish
about the bloody knife attack at Cairine Wilson high school long
after the bright yellow crime scene tape is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Teens are trying to come to terms with the violent intrusion
into their safe haven Thursday when four students and a lab
technician were attacked with a kitchen steak knife.
</P>
<P>
   The injuries were minor but the incident badly shook the
suburban Ottawa school.
</P>
<P>
   The attack came without warning. There had been no threats of
violence, unlike several schools across Canada bracing for the
first-year anniversary of the school shootings in Columbine, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people are going to be looking over their back a lot
for the next little while at school,'' Kaaveh Shoumanesh, 18, said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The school won't feel as safe until we all get comfortable
again and we also help each other get through it.''
</P>
<P>
   A 15-year-old boy described as a loner who was often teased by
his schoolmates was admitted to hospital with self-inflicted
injuries on his wrists and hands. Police say he will be charged as
soon as today.
</P>

Quebec's Duplessis Orphans Press For Apology And Compensation
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Warmed by a new showing of public support,
Duplessis Orphans walked in a cold spring rain Friday to press for
redress for abuse suffered a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   The orphans -- often illegitimate or just children from poor
families -- were warehoused in institutions run by the Roman
Catholic church between 1940 and 1960, during the regime of
iron-fisted premier Maurice Duplessis.
</P>
<P>
   The orphans say many of them were abused. Others were falsely
labeled mentally deficient so the orphanages would get more federal
financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors are demanding improved compensation and an apology
for their mistreatment.
</P>
<P>
   The group of about 100 walked in silence to denounce the
''conspiracy of silence'' that they say unites the provincial
government, the church, and Quebec's College of Physicians against
them.
</P>
<P>
   But upon reaching their destination at Notre Dame Basilica in
Old Montreal, they were eager to speak out about a public opinion
poll released this week suggesting a majority of Quebecers supports
their demands.

New Wave Of Biker Violence May Be Under Way in Quebec
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- The fatal shooting this week of an elite member
of the Hells Angels appears to have triggered a new wave of
violence in Quebec's biker-gang wars.
</P>
<P>
   With a total of three bikers killed in recent days, expert
investigators say there's no way of knowing how far the attacks,
and the ensuing retaliation, will extend in the gangs' six-year
battle for control of the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   The bloodshed started Monday when Norman Hamel was chased
through a parking lot in suburban Laval and killed by two gunshots.
</P>
<P>
   Hamel, 44, was a member of the Hells Angels' elite Nomad chapter
in Quebec and was said to be close to the gang's reputed head,
Maurice (Mom) Boucher.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, another biker believed to be associated with the
Hells Angels was found dead near a ski center in Piedmont, north of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   The latest incident was the death Thursday of a 32-year-old man
reported to have connections with a biker gang at odds with the
Hells.

Attorney General Won't Overturn Homolka Plea Bargain
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Despite new public revelations about Karla
Homolka's participation in the sexual torture of young women,
Ontario's attorney general has ruled out overturning her
controversial plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Flaherty says revoking the manslaughter deal that gave the
ex-wife of sex killer Paul Bernardo 12 years is out of the
question, and isn't within his purview.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Flaherty said he is closely watching the
obstruction of justice trial of former Bernardo lawyer Ken Murray.
</P>
<P>
   When it is over, he intends to lobby for changes that will
ensure families are not re-victimized during court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ''The really tragic part is the effect on the families, the
Mahaffy family and the French family,'' Flaherty said, referring to
the relatives of two of Bernardo's teen-age victims.
</P>
<P>
   Murray is on trial in St. Catharines, Ontario, accused of
obstruction after holding on to videotapes depicting the rape and
torture of four Bernardo victims, including Leslie Mahaffy and
Kristen French, for 16 months while he prepared a defense for his
client.

<HEADLINE> Talk of Confederation in Taiwan  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan's newly elected leader expressed
interest Friday in considering a confederation with rival China -- a
relationship a visiting Chinese policy expert said Beijing would
surely reject.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a list of top Cabinet members in Taiwan's new
government was announced, featuring prominent numbers of women,
technocrats and academics who will be key in the push to improve
relations with China and clean up corruption.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important posts was given to Tsai Ying-wen, an
expert on international trade who will head the Mainland Affairs
Council, which handles China policy.
</P>
<P>
   Tsai, who could be on the front line in possible talks with
Beijing, may have been tapped for her experience in helping to
negotiate Taiwan's bid to join the World Trade Organization. Taiwan
and China are expected to enter the organization that regulates
global trade and will have to negotiate lifting five-decade-old
trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of repairing a 51-year China-Taiwan split by forming a
loose alliance between the two sides, similar to the British
Commonwealth, has been proposed before by Taiwanese thinkers. But
President-elect Chen Shui-bian has not been a vocal proponent of
the notion.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Chen showed flexibility on the issue and said that
creating a confederation might be a way to break the impasse
between China and Taiwan, which separated amid civil war in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   The issued was raised by elderly presidential adviser Sun
Yun-suan, whom Chen visited while making traditional courtesy calls
to influential figures in the current government.
</P>
<P>
   Chen said he did not have the power to single-handedly determine
the future of Taiwan and that there would have to be public
consensus before Taiwan pressed ahead in trying to establish a
confederation with the mainland. But he said it was an example of
''new thinking that could bring a breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen added, ''There's a lot of room for discussion of this
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   But Yu Keli, a Chinese scholar with close connections to the
Beijing government, told reporters that China would not agree to
forming a confederation because it wouldn't suit China's current
situation. Yu, who has been visiting Taiwan this week, did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Most polls say that the majority of Taiwanese do not favor
reunification with China as long as it is ruled by a repressive
communist government.
</P>
<P>
   Chen said there was a ''thick icy wall'' between Taiwan and
China, and he warned Beijing that continued threats would only make
relations more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the best way to break down the wall would be to rely
on the warmth of the sun to melt it,'' Chen said, urging Beijing to
use a softer approach.
</P>
<P>
   Since his election last month, Chen has tried to be flexible on
the China issue and has made several goodwill gestures. He has
offered to meet with Chinese leaders and discuss any topic.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has refused to meet with Chen unless he agrees that
Taiwan is an inseparable part of China. Taiwan won't accept the
condition, fearing that as a mere part of China the island wouldn't
be treated as an equal at the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-member Cabinet, picked by Chen and Premier-designate Tang
Fei, includes several members of the Nationalist Party, defeated by
Chen in last month's vote. Tang, the current defense minister, is a
Nationalist.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's small Democratic Progressive Party also won several
appointments. DPP Secretary-general Yu Shyi-kun was named vice
premier and lawmaker Yeh Chu-lan will be transportation minister.
</P>
<P>
   DPP lawmaker Chen Ting-nan will be the justice minister,
responsible for helping Chen keep his promise to clean up graft.
</P>
<P>
   But many other posts were assigned to independents and academics
in keeping with Chen's promise to establish a ''government for all
the people.''

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Anwar May Give Up Defense  </HEADLINE>
By ALVIN UNG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Jailed politician Anwar Ibrahim
told his lawyers Friday to consider ending efforts to defend him,
after a judge ruled that Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was not
required to testify at Anwar's sex trial.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's decision ended a six-month effort by defense lawyers
to subpoena Mahathir. Anwar, a former deputy prime minister,
maintains was framed in a plot masterminded by Mahathir to crush
his one-time protege's political career.
</P>
<P>
   If he is convicted, Anwar, 53, could receive up to 20 years in
prison. He is already serving a six-year term for corruption. In
both trials, defense lawyers have repeatedly blamed the judge for
blocking their arguments and not allowing Anwar a fair defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''His (Anwar's) confidence in the administration of justice has
been completely eroded,'' defense attorney Christopher Fernando
told the court. ''His immediate reaction now is to abandon this
trial because he feels his chances of succeeding'' are slim.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando then asked High Court Judge Ariffin Jaka to adjourn the
hearing until Wednesday to give Anwar time to reconsider his
decision. If Anwar abandons his defense, his lawyers will not
present final arguments and the judge will rule based on the
evidence given so far.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, Ariffin had rejected a defense plea for Mahathir
-- Malaysia's ruler since 1981 -- to testify in the sensational sex
trial. The judge said that there was no evidence to show that
Mahathir was involved in a ''political conspiracy to fabricate
evidence of sodomy to topple Anwar Ibrahim.''
</P>
<P>
   Anwar, who was fired by Mahathir in September 1998, jumped up
and shook his fist at the judge.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dr. Mahathir should have the moral courage to come to this
court and not hide behind your cloak,'' he yelled at the judge,
pounding the wooden guard rail of the dock with his fist. ''Where
is the justice in this court?''

<HEADLINE> Nations Unite For Afganistan Threats  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOFEI ZHUKOV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TASHKENT, Uzbekistan (AP) -- Leaders of four former Soviet
republics in Central Asia on Friday signed a security pact intended
to help contain the flow of drugs and preventing radical Islamic
groups from expanding their influence across the region.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Afghanistan as the ''main source of fanaticism and
extremism in the region,'' Uzbekistan's President Islam Karimov
said: ''We have found ourselves exposed to a powerful ideological
expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   Karimov spoke after signing the treaty with presidents Nursultan
Nazarbayev of Kazakstan, Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzstan and Emomali
Rakhmonov of Tajikistan. The pact calls for expanding cooperation
between the countries' security agencies and envisages joint
military action if one is attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ''This document amounts to a defense union aimed at protecting
sovereignty and independence of our nations,'' said Nazarbayev.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the four leaders has established strong secular rule,
showing little tolerance for Islamic movements, human-rights
activists and other dissent. They all argue they have to be tough
to prevent the spread of Islamic fundamentalism following the rise
to power of the Taliban militia in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   During visits to Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan that
concluded on Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
warned their leaders against abusing human rights and told them
that the failure to distinguish between peaceful believers and
Islamic extremists would only fuel instability.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Albright underlined that the three nations
were friends to the United States and offered them a $10 million
aid package intended to bolster border security.
</P>
<P>
   The threats to the region were highlighted last year by a series
of bombings of government buildings in Tashkent that killed 13
people and wounded more than 100 -- an attack blamed on Islamic
militants.
</P>
<P>
   Kyrgyzstan last summer suffered an invasion of several hundred
Islamic militants, who were led by an Uzbek warlord alternately
based in Afghanistan and Tajikistan. The militants routed
Kyrgyzstan's troops and held hostages, including four Japanese
geologists, for more than two months before retreating to
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, meanwhile, has tried to maintain its presence in the
region which it dominated for centuries. It has deployed about
25,000 troops and border guards in Tajikistan, and offered to set
up joint defenses with other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Karimov, who in the past has been suspicious of Russian
initiatives, indicated Friday that Uzbekistan would like to get
external assistance to modernize its air defense system -- a clear
nod to Russia, which has long proposed such assistance.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Denounce Holy War Posters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Afghanistan's Taliban leadership distanced
itself Friday from posters in which Osama bin Laden calls for a
holy war against the United States, saying they weren't authorized
by the Taliban or the Saudi Arabian exile.
</P>
<P>
   The small placards have been circulating in Pakistan's
conservative Northwest Frontier Province carrying a message from
the suspected terrorist to Muslim youth to join a holy war against
America. They show burning U.S. and Israeli flags and a cocked
Kalashnikov rifle.
</P>
<P>
   Noorullah Zadran, the first secretary in the Taliban's New York
office, said the Taliban rejected the message in the posters and
said neither the Taliban nor bin Laden had anything to do with
them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not know who is behind that,'' Zadran said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, whom the United States suspects of masterminding the
1998 twin embassy bombings in east Africa, is living as a guest of
the Taliban in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has been told that he is not allowed to make any threat
against anyone or any country in the world,'' Zadran said. ''And
that has been an understanding between us. He has also indicated
that he had never made those posters,'' Zadran said.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has demanded Afghanistan turn bin Laden over to stand
trial on terrorism charges either in the United States or a third
country. The Taliban has so far refused, saying Washington has
given no proof that their guest was involved.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the United States barred all investment in and trade
with the Taliban. The Security Council followed in November 1999
with limited sanctions against the Taliban to press for bin Laden's
extradition.

<P>
   CHIMAYO, N.M. (AP) -- A teen-age couple making a Good Friday
pilgrimage to a church that is said to contain healing dirt were
found shot to death along one of the most popular routes for the
annual trek to the Roman Catholic shrine.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't recall there being an incident like this'' during the
annual journey, said state police Capt. Carlos Maldonado.
</P>
<P>
   The first victim, 17-year-old Richard Martinez of Alcalde, was
found lying on a highway before daybreak about 30 miles north of
Santa Fe. The second victim was his girlfriend, Karen Castanon of
Arroyo Seco, believed to also be 17. Her body was found several
miles away from Martinez's body. Both were students at Los Alamos
High School.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths were being investigated as homicides, but police had
no suspects, said state police Sgt. Royleen Ross-Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point, we are making a public plea for anyone to come
forward with any information. ... We suspect there were people
(other pilgrims) in the area,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The slain boy's father, Ray Martinez, told KOB-TV: ''If they did
it to my son, and Karen, who knows what else they'll do?''
</P>
<P>
   He said his son woke him about 5 a.m. Friday to say he was
leaving on the pilgrimage, ''told me 'I love you, Dad, I'll pray
for you.' And I told him to be careful,'' Martinez said. ''I went
to work, and got a call at work, and (he was) shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Pilgrims and other travelers were diverted around the
yellow-taped crime scene for several hours. Police cut a fence and
sent pilgrims through a field. Traffic was rerouted onto another
highway.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of people each year journey to El Santuario de
Chimayo. Good Friday is the most popular day for the pilgrimage.
Last year, an estimated 65,000 visited the Roman Catholic church
during Holy Week.
</P>
<P>
   By midday Friday, pilgrims had already packed the small adobe
church. Many arrived carrying wooden crosses or lilies. Some had
walked only a mile or two; others had been on the road for two or
three days.
</P>
<P>
   The draw is a room with a small hole whose dirt is thought to
possess healing power. The room is filled with crutches and canes
left behind by visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Gonzales of Santa Fe said she has been coming to the
church since she was a small child with eczema on her knees and
elbows.
</P>
<P>
   ''My parents brought me the holy dirt for the bleeding and
itching. I rubbed the dirt on my skin, and it made the itching
stop,'' she said. ''It's not about the dirt making miracles, but
the faith you must have to make it come true.''

<HEADLINE> Nations Talk on Afghanistan Threats  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOFEI ZHUKOV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TASHKENT, Uzbekistan (AP) -- Leaders of four former Soviet
republics in Central Asia on Friday signed a security pact intended
to help contain the flow of drugs and preventing radical Islamic
groups from expanding their influence across the region.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Afghanistan as the ''main source of fanaticism and
extremism in the region,'' Uzbekistan's President Islam Karimov
said: ''We have found ourselves exposed to a powerful ideological
expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   Karimov spoke after signing the treaty with presidents Nursultan
Nazarbayev of Kazakstan, Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzstan and Emomali
Rakhmonov of Tajikistan. The pact calls for expanding cooperation
between the countries' security agencies and envisages joint
military action if one is attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ''This document amounts to a defense union aimed at protecting
sovereignty and independence of our nations,'' said Nazarbayev.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the four leaders has established strong secular rule,
showing little tolerance for Islamic movements, human-rights
activists and other dissent. They all argue they have to be tough
to prevent the spread of Islamic fundamentalism following the rise
to power of the Taliban militia in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   During visits to Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan that
concluded on Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
warned their leaders against abusing human rights and told them
that the failure to distinguish between peaceful believers and
Islamic extremists would only fuel instability.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Albright underlined that the three nations
were friends to the United States and offered them a $10 million
aid package intended to bolster border security.
</P>
<P>
   The threats to the region were highlighted last year by a series
of bombings of government buildings in Tashkent that killed 13
people and wounded more than 100 -- an attack blamed on Islamic
militants.
</P>
<P>
   Kyrgyzstan last summer suffered an invasion of several hundred
Islamic militants, who were led by an Uzbek warlord alternately
based in Afghanistan and Tajikistan. The militants routed
Kyrgyzstan's troops and held hostages, including four Japanese
geologists, for more than two months before retreating to
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, meanwhile, has tried to maintain its presence in the
region which it dominated for centuries. It has deployed about
25,000 troops and border guards in Tajikistan, and offered to set
up joint defenses with other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Karimov, who in the past has been suspicious of Russian
initiatives, indicated Friday that Uzbekistan would like to get
external assistance to modernize its air defense system -- a clear
nod to Russia, which has long proposed such assistance.

<HEADLINE> Russians OK Nuclear Test Ban Treaty  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY RENFREW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian lawmakers overwhelmingly approved a ban on
nuclear test explosions Friday, boosting Moscow's campaign to
pressure the United States into sweeping nuclear arms cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The approval by Russia's State Duma, or lower chamber of
parliament, of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty gives
Moscow a symbolic edge on the United States, where the Senate last
year rejected the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian approval came a week after the Duma ended seven
years of deadlock by passing START II, a treaty to scrap thousands
of U.S. and Russian nuclear warheads. It also came just days before
an international review of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is
to begin in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials hailed the ratification, saying it would back
their drive to stop the United States from building an anti-nuclear
missile defense system. Moscow believes the two votes by the Duma
will help swing world opinion behind Russia in the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will help Russia in arms talks with Americans, taking
away their main trump card, which has been Russia's repeated
failure to ratify nuclear treaties,'' said Gennady Raikov, a senior
lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the Americans go ahead with building anti-missile defenses,
they will find themselves isolated under the fire of public
opinion,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is expected to try to take advantage of the Duma's
actions when Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov attends talks next week
in the United States on arms control issues, including the
anti-ballistic missile and non-proliferation treaties.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty approved Friday would ban nuclear tests only when the
United States and other nations with nuclear capability also
approve it, although Russia has not conducted a nuclear explosion
since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan welcomed the treaty
ratification and urged other countries to do so soon to allow it to
enter into force.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Senate rejected the treaty in 1999 after opponents said
it would weaken American security. Other holdouts include China,
Egypt, Pakistan, India and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat was a foreign policy setback for President Clinton,
but the Russian ratification now could help him in the push for
Senate approval.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Clinton on Friday congratulated
President Vladimir Putin, the Duma ''and Russian citizens who
together worked to achieve this important step toward a safer
future.''
</P>
<P>
   The Duma accepted the treaty by a vote of 298-74 after minimal
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who was elected last month, pushed the Duma to approve
the test ban treaty and START II. Putin has made arms reductions a
key part of his foreign policy and is pushing for further cuts
under a proposed START III, which is being negotiated by U.S. and
Russian diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Putin and other Russian leaders strongly oppose American
proposals to amend the 1972 ABM treaty to allow construction of a
limited missile defense system. Washington says the system is
needed to defend against possible attacks by states such as North
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Russia fears the U.S. system would make its own nuclear forces
ineffective despite American denials. Putin has threatened to pull
out of all nuclear arms control agreements if Washington goes ahead
with it.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has warned that Russia cannot afford a new nuclear arms
race. Russia's nuclear forces, like the rest of the military, are
falling apart because of the country's economic decline.
</P>
<P>
   But while Russia may get a moral or symbolic boost from its
approval of the test ban and START II, analysts say Moscow is still
in a weak position and will find it difficult to force any major
changes by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a strong move for Russia, but mostly in the propaganda
field,'' said Yevgeny Volk of the Heritage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say Putin may compromise on the ABM treaty. Some
Russian generals reportedly want a change to agreements that
prevent Moscow putting multiple-warheads on land-based missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The test ban treaty must be ratified by the upper chamber of
parliament, the Federation Council, where swift approval is
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, the Security Council approved the final text of
Russia's new military doctrine, which broadens the Kremlin's
authority to use nuclear weapons. Under the dictum, Russian leaders
could use nuclear weapons to oppose any attack if other efforts
fail.
</P>
<P>
   The doctrine, which Putin said he would sign on Friday, will
replace one adopted in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Cops: Man Linked to Wash. Slayings  </HEADLINE>
By MARK JEWELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- The slayings of nine women are
definitively linked by DNA and other physical evidence to a
middle-aged father of five already charged in the killing of a
prostitute, investigators said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Further lab tests are expected to tie Robert Lee Yates, Jr., 47
to the slayings of three other women shot to death from 1996 to
1998, Sheriff Mark Sterk said.
</P>
<P>
   Yates, an aluminum smelter worker and Army National Guard
helicopter pilot, has been charged with first-degree murder in just
one case so far.
</P>
<P>
   Additional charges are expected to be filed after more precise
DNA tests are completed in a few days and police reports are
available, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have to rush through it,'' county Prosecutor Steve
Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, investigators said Yates was linked to at least a
dozen slayings, but did not specify which killings or disclose the
number of cases in which lab results definitively pointed to Yates.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also are looking for possible links to six
additional killings in Washington dating to 1990, Sterk said. In
all cases, the victims were involved in prostitution, drugs, or
both.
</P>
<P>
   Sterk would not discuss what non-DNA evidence investigators
have. All victims had been shot, with most of the bodies dumped in
remote areas on the edge of town.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have not commented on a motive in the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Yates is being held in lieu of $1.5 million cash-only bond at
the Spokane County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Richard Fasy, said Friday he could not yet comment
on the allegations and had spoken to Yates just once in jail, and
only briefly.
</P>
<P>
   As Sterk read the names of victims detectives believe Yates is
tied to, the sister of one victim watched from behind a row of
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm shaking right now,'' Kathy Lloyd said after her sister,
Shawn McClenahan, was named as one of Yates' alleged victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm getting shakier as the days go on,'' added Lloyd.

Clinton Questioned on '96 Campaign
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal prosecutors interviewed President Clinton today --
and Vice President Al Gore earlier this week -- as part of a long-running
investigation into alleged fund-raising abuses in the 1996 Clinton-Gore
re-election campaign. Clinton's interview with the Justice Department Campaign
Finance Task Force was conducted under oath and lasted four hours, said a White
House official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Attorney General Janet Reno
established the task force to investigate allegations that illegal foreign and
corporate donations were made in the 1996 presidential campaign.

Elian's Transfer Plan Developing
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Justice Department spokeswoman said Attorney General
Janet Reno worked with outside intermediaries in Miami today on a possible
agreement that would transfer custody of Elian Gonzalez from his Miami relatives
to his father immediately. Details of the plan have not been worked out, said
Justice spokeswoman Carole Florman. Florman would not identify the
intermediaries other than as members of the Miami community. She said they were
in contact with Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez and his family, who have
defied Reno's order to transfer Elian.

Amato Asked To Lead Italy Coalition
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Treasury Minister Giuliano Amato set to work Friday on putting
together a new government, after the ruling center-left coalition pledged to
support his bid to be Italy's next premier. President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi gave
Amato, Socialist premier in 1992-93, the go-ahead after majority leaders
insisted their support was solid. If the politically independent Amato succeeds
in forming Italy's 58th government since World War II, he must put the new
coalition to a vote of confidence in Parliament. If it is approved, he will
replace Premier Massimo D'Alema, who resigned on Wednesday.

Taiwan Head Suggests Confederacy

   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan's newly elected leader expressed interest
Friday in considering a confederation with rival China -- a relationship a
visiting Chinese policy expert said Beijing would surely reject. On Friday,
President-elect Chen Shui-bian said that creating a confederation might be a way
to break the impasse between China and Taiwan, which separated amid civil war in
1949. Most polls say that the majority of Taiwanese do not favor reunification
with China as long as it is ruled by a repressive communist government.

Pilgrims Retrace Jesus' Final Steps

   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Singing hymns and carrying large wooden crosses, throngs of
millennium pilgrims marched in solemn Good Friday processions today, retracing
what tradition says were Jesus' final steps to his crucifixion. The half-mile
Via Dolorosa, or Way of Sorrows, snakes east to west through the walled Old City
of Jerusalem, from the Lion's Gate to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, where
tradition says Jesus was crucified and buried.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ridiculed as an environmental extremist who wants to scrap
the internal combustion engine, Vice President Al Gore said on the eve of Earth
Day that he wears such criticism as a ''badge of honor.'' As the nation
celebrates the 30th Earth Day tomorrow, Gore is focusing anew on the
environment, an issue on which his supporters believe Republican presidential
rival George W. Bush is especially vulnerable. Up to now, however, the
Democratic candidate has not been able to energize environmental activists

of the most popular routes for the annual trek to the Roman Catholic shrine. The
first victim, 17-year-old Richard Martinez of Alcalde, was found lying on a
highway before daybreak about 30 miles north of Santa Fe. The second victim was
his girlfriend, Karen Castanon of Arroyo Seco, believed to also be 17. Her body

<HEADLINE> Clinton Responds To Disbarment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has responded to a request
that he be disbarred for false testimony given in the Paula Jones
sexual harassment case, a Clinton administration official said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas' Supreme Court Committee on Professional Conduct set a
deadline of Friday for the president to answer accusations against
him.
</P>
<P>
   ''All deadlines have been met,'' said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyer, David Kendall, did not return telephone calls
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Both a federal judge and the Southeastern Legal Foundation in
Atlanta filed complaints against Clinton. The judge referred the
matter to the state Supreme Court committee after finding Clinton
in contempt of court last year. The law group had filed its
complaint earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the committee's work is private, though parties can
release material.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Glavin, Southeastern Legal Foundation president, said
Friday he had no word on Clinton's response.
</P>
<P>
   Possible sanctions, if any, against the president could range
from censure to a disbarment recommendation to the Pulaski County
Circuit Court. Glavin said Clinton should be disbarred.
</P>
<P>
   The first complaint seeking to revoke Clinton's Arkansas law
license was filed on Sept. 15, 1998, by the Atlanta foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The second complaint arose automatically under state law when
U.S. District Court Judge Susan Webber Wright found Clinton in
contempt of court on April 12, 1999, for lying about his sexual
relationship with Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   The president's law license was renewed Feb. 29, for a $100 fee,
though it was not clear whether Clinton paid the money or someone
else did so.
</P>
<P>
   Although complaints before the professional conduct committee
are handled in private, details of the Clinton case were publicized
by the state Supreme Court on Jan. 27 when the court directed its
professional conduct committee to act.
</P>
<P>
   March 16 was the original deadline for Clinton to respond, but
he received an extension.

<HEADLINE> Man Fired Over Cheap Gas Prices  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEWATER, Mass. (AP) -- The operator of a gas station who says
he cut prices out of sympathy for consumers hit by spiraling fuel
costs said Friday he's being fired for selling cheap gas.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Saghbini said the owners of Bridgewater Shell were letting
him go because he recently cut the price of regular gas to $1.39 a
gallon -- 3 cents per gallon less than what he said he paid Shell.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for station owner Motiva Enterprises LLC said
the company made a decision six months ago to close the station
because it had low sales.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our decision to close the station in 90 days is not associated
in any way with the dealer's current discount program,'' said Shawn
Frederick. ''It was a business decision based upon the fact that
the station is no longer economically viable.''
</P>
<P>
   Saghbini, who has operated the station for more than two years,
dropped the price of regular gas on Monday. Since then, he said,
his business has boomed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have lines all the way to the street,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prices at Massachusetts self-service stations on Friday averaged
$1.54 for regular unleaded gasoline, $1.63 for mid-grade and $1.70
for premium.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm doing it for the consumer,'' Saghbini said. ''The consumer
needs a break.''

   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia Friday announced it has barred the use of
middlemen in arranging foreign adoptions, a move that complicates
finding new homes for children from the country's often-dismal
orphanages.
</P>
<P>
   Prospective parents will now have to come to Russia and clear
bureaucratic hurdles themselves, a process that can take months,
deputy Education Minister Yelena Chepurnykh told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   However, the new rules will allow foreign adoption agencies to
apply for official registration and open offices in Russia, a move
some U.S. adoption workers have said would be beneficial. The rules
say that accredited agencies could ''offer necessary help in
arranging adoption.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia hasn't started accrediting foreign adoption agencies
under the new rules, and it is not clear how long that will take.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign agencies now use Russian facilitators to help in dealing
with the adoption bureaucracy, allowing adoptive parents to spend
as little as a week in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is the leading source of foreign children adopted in the
United States, with U.S. parents adopting 4,348 Russian kids last
year, according to the U.S. State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has an estimated 600,000 children in some form of state
custody, with little chance of finding adoptive families in their
economically troubled homeland. A 1998 report by the Human Rights
Watch group criticized conditions in orphanages, saying children
were often abused by older children and staff and were frequently
misdiagnosed as mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
   But foreign adoption has struck a nerve with some communists and
nationalists, who say the process constitutes baby-selling.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules, which were signed by President Vladimir Putin on
March 28, and went into effect Thursday, ban ''intermediaries'' but
allow ''representatives'' without conclusively defining either.
</P>
<P>
   If an adoption is already in progress, it is up to local courts
to decide whether to continue, she said.

<HEADLINE> Expos 5, Brewers 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Vladimir Guerrero hit a pair of two-run homers
and drove in five runs as the Montreal Expos handed the Milwaukee
Brewers their fifth straight loss, 5-1 win Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero, who also had a run-scoring single, went 3-for-4 to
raise his average to .440. Guerrero homered off Jimmy Haynes (2-1)
in the sixth and Curtis Leskanic in the eighth to give him an
NL-leading 23 RBIs in 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   Dustin Hermanson (2-1) allowed one run and six hits in eight
innings. He has allowed one run in 17 innings in his last two
starts -- pitching a shutout against Philadelphia -- to lower his ERA
from 6.55 to 2.89.
</P>
<P>
   Ugueth Urbina came on with runners at first and third and one
out in the ninth and got two outs for his fourth save. Urbina moved
past John Wetteland with 106 career saves for the Expos, the third
most in team history.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero got his 300th career RBI in the fourth inning when he
singled home Rondell White, who had doubled off Haynes to lead off
the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee's Geoff Jenkins hit his fifth homer of the season off
Hermanson with two outs in the sixth to tie it at 1.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Vidro walked with one out in the bottom half and advanced
to second on White's groundout. With first base open, the Brewers
elected to pitch to Guerrero, who launched a 401-foot shot deep
into the left-field stands for his sixth homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero connected off Leskanic in the eighth for his sixth
career two-homer game and 99th career homer. Guerrero also homered
twice against Los Angeles in Montreal's season opener April 3.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes, who was acquired from Oakland last Dec. 13, allowed
three runs and five hits in six innings. Notes: Neither SS Mark
Loretta nor OF James Mouton started for the Brewers, though both
were available off the bench. Loretta left Thursday night's 5-4
loss in New York with a mild concussion in the sixth inning after
he collided with Mouton while fielding a pop foul. ... The Brewers
last lost five straight last Aug. 20-24. ... With three off-days
scheduled through May 4, the Expos plan to go with a four-man
rotation of Hermanson, Hideki Irabu, Javier Vazquez and Carl
Pavano. Jeremy Powell, who started but did not figure in the
decision in Thursday night's 10-6 loss to Chicago, was optioned to
Triple-A Ottawa following the game. INF Andy Tracy, who will be
used as a left-handed bat off the bench, was recalled.

<HEADLINE> Lost Umpires' Equipment Causes Delay  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Lost umpires' equipment resulted in a frenzied
shopping trip, a police escort and a 27-minute delay to the start
of the Los Angeles Dodgers-Cincinnati Reds game on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   When the umpires arrived from Montreal on Friday, they learned
that their equipment had been sent to New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds loaned shin guards, chest protector, a mask and some
other items, but a few of the essentials -- a brush to clean home
plate, a ball and strike indicator for home plate umpire C.B.
Bucknor -- were missing.
</P>
<P>
   With a shopping list printed in pencil, Reds clubhouse manager
Rick Stowe and an attendant got in a car and headed for a downtown
sporting goods store, only to find it closed. With game time
approaching, they took off for another store on the west side of
town.
</P>
<P>
   ''We started filling a shopping cart,'' Stowe said, between
trips to the umpires' room shortly before the first pitch. ''We got
a brush, indicator, long johns, turtle necks, rain suits. We just
started pulling stuff off the shelves.''
</P>
<P>
   After charging a bill that came to over $600, they ran into
another problem as they headed back to the stadium -- traffic was
backed up and the first pitch was only 15 minutes away. They
flagged down a police car and got an escort to the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The first pitch was delayed from 7:05 p.m. EDT to 7:32 p.m. When
the umpires took the field, they were wearing the recently
purchased black rain jackets and pants made for golfers. The
temperature was 42 degrees and a day-long drizzle had just ended.
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, umpires' equipment was shipped by Pilot Air
Freight Corp., a company controlled by Richie Phillips. Umpires
voted during the offseason to replace Phillips' Major League
Umpires Association with a new union, the World Umpires
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball decided to no longer use Pilot.

<HEADLINE> A's Sign SS Tejada To 4-Year Deal  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Shortstop Miguel Tejada, part of
Oakland's corps of rising young stars, signed an $11 million,
four-year contract Friday with the Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Tejada, 23, set an Oakland team record last year for RBIs by a
shortstop with 84 and his 21 home runs fell one shy of Bert
Campaneris' club record for shortstops.
</P>
<P>
   The signing of Tejada gives the A's seven players with contracts
beyond the 2000 seasons, including outfielder Ben Grieve and first
baseman Jason Giambi.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were very tenacious on this deal. We were not going to go
away. We thought it was critical to get Miguel's contract done,''
general manager Billy Beane said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal concluded nine months of on-again, off-again
negotiations and means the team will have two of its top young
players in Tejada and Grieve locked up through their arbitration
eligible years.
</P>
<P>
   Tejada, who grew up in an impoverished area of the Dominican
Republic and signed his first pro contract with the A's for $2,000
as a teen-ager, said he's thrilled with the new deal. His previous
contract would have paid him $290,000 this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never had this kind of money before,'' he said. ''I'm
real happy right now. Now, the only things I'm worried about is
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Tejada said he also plans to help family members who continue to
reside in the Dominican Republic town of Bani.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to help my father. I'm going to buy him a house,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tejada has started all 16 games at shortstop this season for the
A's and is hitting .268 with a home run and nine RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's already a solid player,'' Oakland manager Art Howe said.
''He's getting better each year. Hopefully, this will relax him.''
</P>
<P>
   Howe said he thinks Tejada still has a tremendous upside to his
game.
</P>
<P>
   ''Miguel can be one of the great ones,'' Howe said. ''He has a
good work ethic. He's a team player and he loves coming out and
playing ball. You just can't estimate his upside.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Easter Message  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   President Clinton's Easter message, as released by
the White
House Friday:
<TEXT>
<P>
   Warm greetings to everyone celebrating Easter.
</P>
<P>
   In this holy season, Christians across America and around the
world relive the events of Jesus' life, death and Resurrection,
rejoice in His fulfillment of the promise of salvation and give
prayerful thanks for the assurance of God's forgiving love.
</P>
<P>
   As Christians, we have been called to share that forgiveness
with others. Across the globe, in places large and small, we have
witnessed the tragic consequences of humanity's refusal to forgive.
Ancient feuds, ethnic tensions, old hatreds and prejudices -- these
have torn apart families, communities and nations for decades and
continue to bring suffering to our world. On this, the first Easter
of the new millennium and in the Jubilee Year of Christ's birth,
the challenge to each of us is to reflect God's love and
forgiveness in all our actions.
</P>
<P>
   Let us strive to see beyond the surface differences that may
divide us from one another by discovering the values we share. Let
us work together to lift the yoke of poverty and oppression that
crushes so many lives around the world. Let us recognize that, in
Jesus' Resurrection, we see both the promise and the proof of
love's capacity to triumph over the forces of misunderstanding,
fear and hatred.
</P>
<P>
   As millions of Americans gather with loved ones to share the joy
of this blessed holiday, Hillary and I extend our best wishes to
all for a wonderful Easter celebration.

<HEADLINE> Phillies 4, Marlins 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Bobby Abreu went 4-for-4 with a home run and a
double, and Andy Ashby pitched a seven-hitter as the Philadelphia
Phillies overcame a three-run deficit Friday night to beat the
Florida Marlins 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Abreu, who has hit safely in seven of his last eight games,
scored twice, stole two bases and broke a 3-3 tie in the fifth with
his third homer of the season. He increased his career average
against Florida to .365 (46-for-126).
</P>
<P>
   Ashby (1-1) allowed one earned run, struck out three and walked
three in his 19th complete game, his first since last July 4
against Colorado. With runners at first and second in the ninth, he
retired pinch-hitter Mark Smith on a game-ending grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Nunez (0-2) allowed four runs and eight hits in seven
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Florida scored all its runs in the second. Paul Bako hit an RBI
single and a run scored when Ashby threw wildly to first for an
error on Mark Kotsay's comebacker. Alex Gonzalez's sacrifice fly
made it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia closed within a run in the third on Scott Rolen's
RBI double and Rico Brogna's run-scoring grounder, then tried the
game in the fourth on Doug Glanville's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Brant Brown doubled for Florida leading off the seventh and was
sacrificed to third by Kotsay, but Gonzalez and Cliff Floyd
grounded out.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Umpires called the teams back from the dugouts after
changing a call that had seemed to end the Phillies' eighth. With
one out and Mickey Morandini on first, Desi Relaford hit a liner
off pitcher Ricky Bones. The ball was caught in the air by
Gonzalez, who threw to first. The original ruling was that the ball
had never hit the ground and that Morandini was doubled up. After
the Marlins left the field and a lengthy discussion with
Philadelphia manager Terry Francona, it was ruled that the ball did
hit the ground and that the throw to first retired Relaford.
Television replays seemed to clearly indicate that the ball hit the
ground. Andy Ashby then hit an inning-ending grounder. ... Brogna
bruised his right knee when hit by a Nunez pitch in the first. He
left in the sixth, and X-rays were negative. ... Florida 2B Chris
Clapinski picked up Relaford's grounder off the glove of a diving
Millar at first, and threw to Nunez at first for the out.

Russians OK Nuclear Test Ban Treaty

   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian lawmakers overwhelmingly approved a ban on nuclear
test explosions Friday, boosting Moscow's campaign to pressure the United States
into sweeping nuclear arms cuts. The approval by Russia's State Duma, or lower
chamber of parliament, of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty gives Moscow
a symbolic edge on the United States, where the Senate last year rejected the
treaty. The Russian approval came a week after the Duma ended seven years of
deadlock by passing START II, a treaty to scrap thousands of U.S. and Russian
nuclear warheads. It also came just days before an international review of the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is to begin in New York.

the rebels fighting Russian troops. Although fighting in the republic has slowed
in recent weeks, the Russian military said Friday it flew more than 40 combat
missions over Chechnya in the past 24 hours and reported small skirmishes on the
ground. In one, Russian soldiers wiped out a small caravan of rebels
transporting supplies on horses through the rugged southern mountains, the
federal command said. Troops also killed a group of rebels northwest of Grozny,
the Chechen capital, but further details were not available, the ITAR-Tass news

<HEADLINE> Penguins 2, Capitals 1  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jaromir Jagr, barely able get a shot off the
entire game, accidentally scored the series-winner with a pass.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr's cross-ice feed from the right wing was deflected into the
net by Washington Capitals defenseman Calle Johansson with 12:04 to
play Friday night, giving the Pittsburgh Penguins a 2-1 victory
that ended the first-round Eastern Conference series in five games.
</P>
<P>
   Johansson let out a cry of disbelief, then stood with his stick
and hands on his knees for several seconds after realizing he had
knocked in the goal that repeated a familiar scenario from the
Capitals' past: great regular season, lousy playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins have been the biggest culprit, winning five of six
playoff series against the Caps over the past decade. They won this
one with a 7-0 rout in Game 1, followed by three victories in four
consecutive one-goal games in which little separated the teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals were the No. 2 seed. Pittsburgh was No. 7, but that
was considered an aberration because Jagr, the NHL's regular-season
scoring leader, missed 19 games. He had 10 points in this series,
including three goals.
</P>
<P>
   But Jagr was silenced most of Friday's game, held to only one
shot the first two periods as the Capitals forced the usually fluid
Penguins into a tight-checking, dump-and-chase game. Pittsburgh
also missed forward Jan Hrdina, who had four goals in the first
three games, for the second consecutive game with a muscle strain,
forcing coach Herb Brooks to reshuffle his lines.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Wright scored his second goal of the series in the first
period for the Penguins. Sergei Gonchar netted his first of the
playoffs for the Capitals, who lost at home for only the ninth time
all season.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals once again dominated the faceoffs, attributable in
part to Hrdina's absence, but the Pittsburgh defense did another
superb job of protecting goaltender Ron Tugnutt. Pittsburgh skaters
blocked 18 shots in the first two periods.
</P>
<P>
   Each team scored in the first period, but both were typical
Penguins goals, resulting from rare times when a shooter was given
too much space to nail a big drive.
</P>
<P>
   Wright drove one past goaltender Olaf Kolzig from the left
faceoff circle at 5:52. Kolzig guessed stick side; Wright shot
glove side. It was the type of play the Capitals have been relying
on Kolzig to stop all season, but Kolzig found it harder to do
against the Penguins' skilled Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   Gonchar, given space down the middle of the ice, crossed the
blue line and beat Tugnutt high to the stick side at 10:02. It was
the first point of the series for Gonchar, a streaky player who was
key to Washington's Stanley Cup finals run two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Washington forward Chris Simon got a pair in the first period --
a pair of television cameras. Sent off the ice for slashing, Simon
flung a spare puck over the glass and then booted the two TV
cameras that sit at foot of the penalty box. He was given a
10-minute misconduct penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the game was distinctly Capitals hockey: tight
checking, lots of traffic and few odd-man rushes. The Penguins were
unable to capitalize on the rare opportunities to display their
finesse: a 4-on-2 break ended with a bad pass, a 2-on-2 was
disrupted by a line change.
</P>
<P>
   Washington outshot Pittsburgh 26-17, but when the Capitals
finally put the puck in the net a second time, it was the wrong
net.

<HEADLINE> Post Office Halts Moving Payments  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The top finance officer of the Postal Service
retired Friday after a report sharply criticized almost a quarter
of a million dollars in relocation expenses paid to him and another
official.
</P>
<P>
   Postmaster General William Henderson announced the retirement of
Richard Porras, the Postal Service's chief financial officer, so
the agency can move onward ''without any unnecessary
distractions.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson also issued a statement that said: ''Effective
immediately, no deviations from our relocation policy will be
granted when the move does not involve a change in the work
location.''
</P>
<P>
   A report from the post office's inspector general criticized
payment of $248,000 in moving expenses for Porras and another top
manager, controller John Ward, both of whom moved less than 50
miles and continued working in the same offices.
</P>
<P>
   The payments exceeded those offered by private industry, were
not approved by the postal board of governors and ''could be
perceived as a way to circumvent the statutory limits on
compensation,'' Robert L. Emmons, acting inspector general for
performance, concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Counting relocation benefits as income would have boosted the
pay of both men to about $250,000, well over the cap of $151,800 in
effect at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John McHugh, R-N.Y., who heads the House Government Reform
postal subcommittee, said the report alarmed him. ''At a time when
the Postal Service is requesting a series of rate increases, this
sort of mismanagement may undermine the postal customer's
confidence in the agency's ability to operate efficiently,'' McHugh
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has mixed emotions on Porras' departure after 37
years of service. ''I think it's very unfortunate that an
individual of his experience had to get caught up in this situation
and feels it's necessary to leave the service. His background and
expertise was a definite asset that will be missed,'' McHugh said
in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   The report said Henderson approved the payments after consulting
with agency lawyers and the secretary to the board of governors but
not the full board.
</P>
<P>
   The report recommended that written justification be required
for future exemptions to the moving rule and that all exemptions
and other incentive plans for officers be sent to the governors for
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Postal spokeswoman Judy de Torok said there are ''no grounds to
ask for the money back. It was reviewed by counsel, and it was
within management's prerogative to extend the benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   A rule requiring reimbursement only of moves of at least 50
miles and relocation to a new office sometimes is set aside if it
is thought to be in the best interest of the Postal Service. That
decision normally is made by the chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, since Porras was seeking an exemption, the request
went to Henderson, who approved both payments: $142,311 for Porras,
$105,817 for Ward, who succeeded Porras as controller.
</P>
<P>
   The report said Porras moved about 15 miles, but his new
residence was just 2{ miles closer to his Washington office than
the old home. The Postal Service said that the move got him closer
to a post office training center and Dulles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Ward, the report said, moved almost 22{ miles from a home that
was 26 miles from work to one just six miles away, saving 30
minutes of commuting time each way daily.
</P>
<P>
   The Post Office said it had received no statement from Ward and
had no immediate comment about his status.
</P>
<P>
   Porras' payment included $12,075 for transportation of household
goods, $37,275 for real estate expenses, $25,000 for miscellaneous
costs such as new rugs and plumber's bills, $28,961 to cover
withholding taxes and $39,000 in a relocation income tax allowance.
</P>
<P>
   Ward's payment included $7,256 for moving household goods,
$31,573 for real estate costs, $25,000 for miscellaneous expenses,
$24,455 for withholding taxes and $17,533 for relocation income
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Ward also received a ''shared appreciation'' loan from the post
office which helped him cut his monthly mortgage payment by about
$1,000. These loans are designed for managers moving into
higher-cost areas. In granting them the post office receives its
money back when the home eventually is sold and profits from
increases in its value.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service, a semi-independent part of the government,
does not use taxpayer money to fund its operations.
</P>
<P>
   The average relocation of a postal executive costs about
$80,000. The service moved about 1,200 officials in 1998. Eight
were exempted from the 50-mile rule.

<HEADLINE> NATO Accused of Using Uranium Rounds  </HEADLINE>
By KATARINA KRATOVAC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO warplanes used depleted uranium
rounds on eight sites in Yugoslavia during the alliance's 78-day
bombing campaign last year, a government report Friday said.
</P>
<P>
   A team of Yugoslav experts made the study on the environmental
effects of the NATO air strikes launched to stop President Slobodan
Milosevic's crackdown on ethnic Albanians in the province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The report comes a few months after NATO Secretary-General Lord
Robertson confirmed that U.S. jets operating in Kosovo last year
fired the armor-piercing depleted uranium rounds on numerous
missions.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said the rounds were used when American A-10 ground
attack aircraft engaged armored vehicles -- on about 100 missions in
Kosovo. The military says depleted uranium is a dense metal that
provides enhanced armor-piercing capability.
</P>
<P>
   Some specialists believe the uranium rounds are environmentally
harmful. But the U.S. Defense Department has defended the use of
the uranium, saying the rounds contained no more health risk that
conventional weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The Belgrade study aimed to give specifics on all environmental
impacts of the airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   The locations contaminated by the depleted uranium and described
in the 75-page document include six sites in Serbia and one in
Montenegro, Serbia's smaller partner in the Yugoslav federation,
said Gen. Slobodan Petkovic, who presented the report for the
Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The eighth location is in Kosovo, Serbia's southern province.
The region is now run by U.N. and NATO peacekeepers, preventing
examination of the contamination by a Yugoslav team, he said.

<HEADLINE> Blues 5, Sharks 3  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Chris Pronger snapped a third-period tie with a
power-play goal as the St. Louis Blues staved off elimination with
a 5-3 victory over the San Jose Sharks in their Western Conference
first-round series Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL's regular-season champions, who threw away a 3-0
first-period lead before righting themselves, are trying to avoid
becoming the first Presidents' Trophy winner since the 1991 Chicago
Blackhawks to get eliminated in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks carry a 3-2 series lead into Sunday's Game 6 in San
Jose.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues' big three, under fire for lack of production or
undisciplined play on Pronger's part, all made contributions. Al
MacInnis scored his first goal of the playoffs and had an assist,
Pierre Turgeon had two assists, and Pronger kept his cool, spending
only two minutes in the penalty box after totaling 24 the first
four games.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis also trailed 3-1 in the first round last year against
the Phoenix Coyotes, and prevailed in seven games. Fifteen teams
have surmounted a 3-1 series deficit in NHL history, including the
Blues on three occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Ricci had a goal and an assist and Vincent Damphousse had
two assists for the Sharks, who are trying for their third
first-round upset in seven seasons. Ricci and Brad Stuart scored on
the power play for San Jose, which has five man-advantage goals in
the series.
</P>
<P>
   Pronger got his second goal of the playoffs at 3:54 of the
third, tapping the puck into the net after a cross-ice feed from
Jochen Hecht. The goal came with Stephane Matteau off for boarding
after running Lubos Bartecko headfirst into the boards.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Young added an empty-net goal with 33.9 seconds left, off
another feed from Hecht.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues came out flying, with three good scoring chances
stopped by Steve Shields before Ladislav Nagy, a 20-year-old
rookie, scored on the rebound of a Dave Ellett drive at 4:04.
Thirty seconds later, and only five seconds after Marco Sturm was
whistled for high-sticking, MacInnis got his first goal of the
playoffs on a slap shot at 4:39.
</P>
<P>
   At 7:13, Ricard Persson slipped the puck through a maze of
skates from the side of the net to make it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues took the game's first 10 shots, and Roman Turek didn't
even handle the puck until the 10:30 mark. The Sharks got their
first shot, by Damphousse from the right circle on a power play, at
13:16 of the first.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose took advantage of Blues penalties later in the period
to rally, narrowing the shots gap to 11-7 at the end of the period.
Ricci scored his third goal of the playoffs on a backhander from in
front of the net on a power play at 18:52.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks carried the play in the second period, after which
the Blues' shots advantage was whittled to 20-19, and tied it on a
backhander by Jeff Friesen at 12:26 and a drive from the point by
Brad Stuart at 17:03. Friesen's goal deflected off the skate of
Blues defenseman Jeff Finley, continuing a trend of fortuitous
bounces for the Sharks, for his first point of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Turek was screened on Stuart's goal, which came on a power play.

<HEADLINE> Braves 6, Pirates 2  </HEADLINE>
By TOM SALADINO, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Terry Mulholland pitched Atlanta's first complete
game of the season, and Andres Galarraga hit a go-ahead single in a
two-run sixth inning to lead the Atlanta Braves to their fifth
straight win, 6-2 over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mulholland (2-2) allowed eight hits, two walks and struck out
three in his first complete game since June 18, 1997. Mulholland
has 46 career complete games.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga, who hit a pair of home runs and drove in four runs in
Thursday night's 6-4 win over Philadelphia, singled to left to
score Chipper Jones to snap a 2-2 tie in the sixth off reliever
Mike Garcia (0-1).
</P>
<P>
   Jones opened the sixth with a walk and took second on a single
by Brian Jordan. Jordan took third on Galarraga's hit and scored on
a sacrifice fly by Javy Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves added two more runs in the seventh on RBI singles by
Quilvio Veras and Andruw Jones. Veras went 3-for-3 with a walk, and
two RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates had tied it at 2 in the sixth on a solo home run by
Aramis Ramirez, who had been in a 1-for-22 slump before hitting an
0-1 pitch from Mulholland into the left-field stands.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves had gone ahead 2-1 in the fifth on an RBI single by
Veras off Pittsburgh starter Jose Parra. Atlanta's first run came
on a run-scoring single by Chipper Jones in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Parra allowed two runs and five hits in five innings with seven
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh's first run came in the second on an RBI single by
Jason Kendall, who has hit in eight straight games.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Pittsburgh has lost four of five games. ... LHP Steve
Avery, coming back from offseason shoulder surgery, makes his third
rehab start Saturday. He'll pitch for the Braves' Greenville
Double-A club against Mobile. ... Parra, 27, was recalled Thursday
from Triple-A Nashville. His last appearance in the majors was
Sept. 29, 1996 with Minnesota. He pitched in Korea in 1998 and in
Japan last season. ... The Pirates have lost six straight games at
Turner Field and are 1-9 in their last 10 games in Atlanta).

<HEADLINE> Blazers-Timberwolves To Face Off  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- When a reporter dared to suggest that the
Minnesota Timberwolves had an even chance against the Portland
Trail Blazers because the teams split their four regular-season
games, Scottie Pippen questioned the basic laws of arithmetic.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's evenly matched about that?'' Pippen said.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the best-of-five series that begins Sunday, the
numbers don't quite add up for the Timberwolves. They are 0-3 in
the playoffs since the franchise began playing in 1989, while the
Blazers have made the postseason 18 straight years and 23 of the
last 24.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota did finish with a franchise-record 50 victories,
including two in its last two games against the Blazers. But
Portland blew second-half leads in both games, and the Timberwolves
needed shots in the final seconds to win. Kevin Garnett banked in a
10-foot jumper with 3.3 seconds left to win 98-96 on Jan. 6 in
Minneapolis, and Joe Smith got a 17-footer to fall in off the glass
with 15.1 seconds left for a 96-92 victory March 16.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not to take anything away from them, but we kind of beat
ourselves,'' reserve center Jermaine O'Neal said. ''We're very
deep, and we have a ton of talent. I don't think they have enough
firepower to compete with our rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   The marquee individual matchup will be Garnett against Rasheed
Wallace, two of the most emotional and exciting power forwards in
the league. Like their teams, the players battled to a dead heat on
paper this season. Wallace averaged 20 points in the four games,
Garnett 20.3. Wallace outshot Garnett 63 percent to 44, but he was
outrebounded 45-19 and played 21 fewer minutes in the two losses
because of fouls.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we can get him outplaying Kevin and matching up with him
real well and not get in foul trouble, it should be over in
three,'' O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   Because Wallace can handle Garnett virtually by himself, the
Blazers should have a huge advantage inside. Portland center
Arvydas Sabonis, who missed the Jan. 6 game with an upper
respiratory infection and was out nine games late in the season
with a sprained right foot, averaged 10.3 points and 9.3 rebounds
in his three games against Minnesota, compared with 6.0 points and
6.3 rebounds on 27 percent shooting for Timberwolves centers
Radoslav Nesterovic and Dean Garrett.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace and Garnett ''are both going to get 20 a night, so it's
a wash,'' Blazers point guard Damon Stoudamire said. ''So it's
going to come down to everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland led the NBA in field-goal shooting at 47.0 percent,
just ahead of No. 2 Minnesota at 46.7. The Timberwolves are a
better shooting team, with point guard Terrell Brandon driving and
feeding Garnett and Smith or hitting mid-range jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We definitely don't want to get into a jump shooting
contest,'' Brian Grant said. ''If we're contesting every shot and
we've got a hand in their face and they're hitting them, then
there's nothing we can do about that. Except for when the ball does
come off, we make sure we limit them to one shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandon has gotten the best of fellow Portland high school star
Damon Stoudamire, outscoring his close friend 84-48 and getting 10
more assists and six fewer turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be a nice battle, but I'm not here to talk about
me and Terrell,'' Stoudamire said. ''When he tends to play well,
they tend to play well.''

<HEADLINE> Notes From Friday's Baseball Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Yankees-Blue Jays:
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK YANKEES: Andy Pettitte reported no problems after
throwing off a mound for the first time since being placed on the
disabled list with a strained left lateral muscle. The left-hander
threw 50 pitches. He'll throw off the mound again on Sunday, and is
expected to start on Tuesday. ... Roger Clemens, who left
Wednesday's game against Texas with a stiff back, said he'll try to
see a chiropractor in Toronto this weekend. He's expected to make
his next start. ... Yankees' manager Joe Torre said Scott Brosius
may return to the lineup as soon as Tuesday. Brosius is on the
disabled list with a strained rib cage.
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: OF Shannon Stewart missed his seventh straight game
with a pulled quadriceps and strained right hamstring. ... Last
year, the Blue Jays were 2-10 vs. the Yankees. ... Right-hander
Joey Hamilton faced live hitters for the first time in more than a
month on Friday. Hamilton, on the DL since March 21, threw 12
minutes of BP at Grant Field in Dunedin, Fl. ''I threw all
fastballs, four seamers, cutters'', said Hamilton, ''My arm felt
good and it was a very positive outing. I look forward to pitching
BP again in five days, maybe four.'' Hamilton will throw again on
April 25 or 26 against extended spring hitters.
Angels-Devil Rays:
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: Bench coach Joe Maddon went to St. Anthony's Hospital
in St. Petersburg after feeling ill for two days. Tests were
negative and he returned to Tropicana Field for the game. ...
Manager Mike Scioscia expects SS Gary DiSarcina (bruised thumb) to
be ready to come off the disabled list on Monday. ... Friday night
began a stretch in which the Angels will play seven of 10 games
against the Devil Rays. ... RHP Tim Belcher, recovering from elbow
surgery, allowed one baserunner in five innings of a start for
Class A Lake Elsnore on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: Manager Larry Rothschild juggled the batting order
with Greg Vaughn moving from fifth to third, Jose Canseco dropping
from third to cleanup, and Fred McGriff from fourth to fifth. ''It
doesn't change things a whole lot. We've hit fairly well, but we
haven't produced runs and that's the name of the game,'' Rothschild
said. ... LHP Wilson Alvarez, on the DL with a sore pitching
shoulder, played catch before the game and continued to feel
stiffness.
Twins-Rangers:
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: OF Torii Hunter wasn't in the Minnesota starting
lineup for the first time this season. Hunter, a .294 hitter who
has hit safely in 12 of 17 starts this season, was just getting a
break. The Twins opened a six-game road trip, three games at Texas
before three at the New York Yankees. ... The current Twins roster
includes four rookies -- pitchers Mark Redman and Johan Santana,
catcher Matt LeCroy and infielder Jason Maxwell. They are among 12
players who weren't with Minnesota at the start of the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: After not starting the Rangers' last game, SS Royce
Clayton was back in the lineup Friday -- batting ninth instead of in
the leadoff spot like he did the first 14 games. Clayton, who never
made the transition to the leadoff spot in St. Louis, hit just .164
at the top of the Texas lineup. Manager Johnny Oates believes that
moving Clayton from the top spot will help him get on track. ''I'd
like to try something different for a day or two to see how things
work. I will move him back when he gets started,'' Oates said. ...
LHP Justin Thompson, who started the season on the disabled list
while still recovering for shoulder surgery last August, started
for Double-A Tulsa on a medical rehab assignment Thursday and
reported no physical problems. He threw 90 pitches over 5 2-3
innings, allowing three earned runs on eight hits. He struck out
four and walked one. His next scheduled start is Tuesday for
Triple-A Oklahoma.
Tigers-White Sox:
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: Tigers OF-DH Juan Gonzalez disputed a report on ESPN's
Web site that he'd told opponents he had no intention of signing a
long-term deal with the Tigers. Gonzalez said he hadn't made up his
mind on his future: ''I can either play here one year, I don't
know, stay here, I don't know, or go to free agency, I don't know.
Right now I'm here for play baseball,'' he said. ... Manager Phil
Garner, his team shut out four times in the first 14 games, said:
''We are not as bad as we are right now.'' Detroit was blanked 12
times all last season. Garner said the defense has also been
disappointing. ''We haven't made plays to get us out of jams,'' he
said. ...The Tigers were 11-for-57 (.193) with runners in scoring
position during their recent eight-game homestand. Detroit was tied
with Oakland last season for the majors' worst average (.243) with
runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO WHITE SOX: RHP James Baldwin, who missed his last start
after being hit in the chest by a line drive, is scheduled to pitch
again Sunday against the Tigers. Baldwin suffered a bruised rib.
... LHP Mike Sirotka, who missed his previous start with a tender
forearm, played toss Friday and said his arm felt better. He's
scheduled to pitch Tuesday against Baltimore. ... The White Sox
claimed 3B Herbert Perry off waivers from Tampa Bay and plan to
have him for Sunday's series finale against the Tigers. Perry would
be the fourth player to play third base this season, joining Craig
Wilson, Greg Norton and Paul Konerko.
Royals-Mariners:
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: RHP Jay Witasick, who is 0-3 with a 10.13 ERA this
season, will start Saturday after missing his last turn because of
arm fatigue and soreness in his right biceps. In his last start,
Witasick went 3 2-3 innings in a 7-5 loss to the New York Yankees.
He allowed five runs and seven hits.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: LHP Jamie Moyer was placed on the 15-day DL because of
a strained muscle in the back of his left shoulder. The move is
effective to April 15. He is expected to be out about three weeks.
RHP Brett Tomko was recalled from Triple-A Tacoma to take Moyer's
starting spot on Saturday. Tomko, who was acquired in the Feb. 10
trade for Ken Griffey Jr. with Cincinnati, was bothered by soreness
in his left Achilles' tendon all spring.
Athletics-Orioles:
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND-- Shortstop Miguel Tejada signed an $11 million,
four-year deal Friday. He's batting .268 with a homer and nine
RBIs. ... Oakland DH John Jaha is having a tough time making
contact. He has 16 strikeouts in his 28 at bats, including five in
Thursday night's game at Cleveland. He is the fourth Oakland player
to fan five times in a game. The others were Reggie Jackson, Rick
Monday and Jose Canseco.
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE-- Baltimore right-hander Scott Erickson, who underwent
surgery in early March to remove bone chips from his right elbow,
is being sent out on a rehab assignment. He is scheduled to report
to Single A Frederick on Tuesday in his first outing since
undergoing the arthroscopic surgery. ... The 7-8-9 spots in the
Orioles batting order have combined to hit .333 (49-147) with 10
home runs, 37 runs scored and 40 RBIs.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Brewers-Expos:
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: Neither SS Mark Loretta nor OF James Mouton started
Friday night for the Brewers, though both were available off the
bench. Loretta left Thursday night's 5-4 loss in New York with a
mild concussion in the sixth inning after he collided with Mouton
while fielding a pop foul. ... The Brewers entered Friday's game
with a combined record of 81-65 in Canada, having gone 75-62 in
Toronto and 6-3 in Montreal. Milwaukee is 164-121 overall against
the two Canadian teams. ... The Brewers were trying to avoid losing
five straight for the first time since last Aug. 20-24.
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: With three off days scheduled through May 4, the Expos
plan to go with a four-man rotation of Dustin Hermanson, Hideki
Irabu, Javier Vazquez and Carl Pavano. Jeremy Powell, who started
but did not figure in the decision in Thursday night's 10-6 loss to
Chicago, was optioned to Triple-A Ottawa following the game. INF
Andy Tracy contract was purchased from Ottawa, he will be used as a
left-handed bat off the bench. ... Closer Ugueth Urbina's next save
will be his 106th, moving him one ahead of John Wetteland for the
third highest total in franchise history. Mel Rojas is second with
109, while Jeff Reardon is the Expos' career leader with 152 from
1981-86.
Phillies-Marlins:
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: The Marlins still have high hopes for Ramon Castro,
acquired last July from Houston and penciled in during the
offseason as the team's starting catcher. After a disappointing
spring, Castro was sent to Triple-A Calgary, where he was hitting
.294 through Wednesday. ''We do envision that Ramon Castro will be
our No. 1 one, everyday catcher,'' Florida general manager Dave
Dombrowski said. ''We're going to let him keep going, watch him
play, and make those decisions.'' ... It is quite possible that the
Marlins will not finish the season playing their home games at Pro
Player Stadium. If so, the reason won't be the construction of the
new ballpark they want. Rather, it will be due to the fact that a
bankruptcy judge has given permission to stadium officials to seek
another naming-rights partner. Fruit of the Loom, the company that
four years ago signed the $20 million, 10 year contract for the
naming rights, filed for bankruptcy in December and closed its Pro
Player sports clothing division about two months ago. ''We're
moving right along very quickly now that in the last few days we
got the ability to find a new naming-rights partner,'' said stadium
president Bruce Schulze, who indicated that his goal was to have a
new deal in place by the start of the football season.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: Curt Schilling made his fourth rehab start
Thursday night for Philadelphia's A Clearwater affiliate. Facing
St. Petersburg, Schilling pitched eight innings, allowing one run
and four hits, while striking out four. He threw 91 pitches, 60 for
strikes. Schilling will next see action when he starts Tuesday for
Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre against Ottawa. If all goes well, he
will make his Phillies debut on April 30 in Philadelphia against
St. Louis. ... Paul Byrd, Philadelphia's scheduled starter for
Saturday's second game of the series against the Marlins, has a
1.01 career ERA in seven appearances at Pro Player Stadium, his
lowest ERA at any ballpark. He has given up just three earned runs
in 26 2-3 innings pitched.
Dodgers-Reds:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: Gary Sheffield singled in the first inning against
Cincinnati on Friday night. He has reached base in each of his 15
games. ... Heading into the game, Sheffield had a .190 career
average in Cincinnati, his lowest in any NL park.

   CINCINNATI: The helmet that Ken Griffey Jr. wore when he hit his
400th homer in Colorado is heading to baseball's Hall of Fame.
Griffey was the youngest to reach the 400-homer mark, and the Hall
asked for a memento to put on display. Griffey signed the helmet
and added the date of the homer -- April 10 -- before it was shipped
off. ... Reliever Mark Wohlers threw 35 pitches Friday, two days
after an encouraging batting practice session in which he threw the
ball hard and straight. Wohlers, 30, had reconstructive elbow
surgery last July 6 and is four weeks ahead of schedule in his
comeback. He hopes to be able to rejoin the team in June.
Pirates-Braves:
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: RHP Brad Clontz, who began his major league career
with the Braves, was recalled by the Pirates. He went to spring
training with Arizona, was released and signed by Pittsburgh and
sent to their Nashville Triple-A club where he allowed no runs in 4
2-3 innings of relief. ... RHP Jose Parra made his first appearance
Friday in the majors since Sept. 29, 1996 with the Minnesota Twins.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: LHP Bruce Chen was recalled from Triple-A Richmond
after RHP Kevin McGlinchy went on the DL. Chen started the season
with Atlanta and pitched four innings, allowing one run. He pitched
six scoreless innings Tuesday for Richmond. ... Andres Galarraga,
who hit two home runs in Atlanta's 10-1 win Thursday, has 338 in
his career, tied for 64th with Cubs manager Don Baylor.
Padres-Astros:
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: Catcher Wiki Gonzalez's 10-game hitting streak is the
longest of his career. He has hit .394 (13-for-33) during it. ...
Coming into new Enron Field, the Padres were 6-3 playing in new
stadiums. That includes wins at Cincinnati's Riverfront,
Philadelphia's Veterans, Montreal's Olympic, Florida's Joe Robbie,
Colorado's Mile High and Seattle's Safeco Field and losses at
Pittsburgh's Three Rivers, Colorado's Coors Field and Atlanta's
Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: The MRI on Moises Alou's strained calf showed no
serious damage Wednesday but club officials said they didn't expect
him to play in the next two or three days. Alou has missed the last
four games with the injury. ''We're optimistic that he'll be ready
to play by Tuesday,'' general manager Gerry Hunsicker said. Manager
Larry Dierker said he might use Alou as a pinch-hitter this
weekend. ... Dierker admits he's worried about the Astros' 6-8
start. ''It's not something that we feel desperate about yet,'' he
said. ''When you have slump during the season, you don't notice it
as much because you've played well and you know you will again. But
now, we've got to play well just to prove to ourselves we can.''
Rockies-Cardinals:
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: Brian Bohanon, who lost his spot as a starter after
posting a 15.68 ERA in three starts may move back into the rotation
to replace Rolando Arrojo who was injured Thursday while covering
home plate. Arrojo was placed on the disabled list with a popped
hamstring. His place on the roster was filled by pitcher Kevin
Jarvis who was called up from Triple-A Colorado Springs.
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: The Cardinals are looking for a closer to backup Dave
Veres. Manager Tony La Russa said Healthcliff Slocumb, with 97
career saves, is the most likely candidate for the role on nights
when Veres is not available. Slocumb has been used as a setup man
since the Cardinals acquired him last year. ... Alan Benes, trying
for a comeback after two shoulder operations, threw 72 pitches
while allowing one run in 3 2-3 innings Thursday night at Triple-A
Memphis.
Giants-Diamondbacks:
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: The Giants 4-11 start going into Friday night's
game is their worst since 1983. The Giants haven't started 4-12
since 1951, the year they came back from 13{ games behind in August
to win the pennant on Bobby Thomson's ''shot heard 'round the
world.'' ... Entering Friday's game, the Giants were 1-7 in
contests decided by two runs or less and 0-5 against NL West foes.
... San Francisco is in the midst of an eight-game road trip that
will take the team 8,211 miles to Cincinnati, Phoenix and Florida,
then back home.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: The Diamondbacks designated right-handed reliever
Darren Holmes for assignment to make room for closer Matt Mantei,
who was activated from the disabled list. Holmes declined an
assignment to Triple-A Tucson, and will be released if he isn't
traded in the next 10 days. ... Tony Womack, who flew to Virginia
for the funeral of his grandmother on Monday, will miss Sunday's
series finale to fly to New York for the funeral of his
father-in-law. ... Diamondbacks pitchers lead the majors with a
3.10 ERA. Randy Johnson leads the way with a 0.76 ERA.

<HEADLINE> Congo Diamond Pillaging To Be Probed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan has
recommended that the Security Council consider creating a panel of
experts to investigate the illegal pillaging of Congo's natural
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Congo has accused Rwanda and Uganda of backing rebels in the
country so they can have access to Congo's diamond and gold mines.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council, already concerned at how diamonds have
fueled Angola's war, asked Annan in a January resolution to suggest
ways to curb the exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   Annan replied back on Thursday with a suggestion that the
council create a panel of experts to launch a six-month
investigation and make recommendations. He said the money could
come from the existing U.N. budget and suggested the panel be based
at the U.N. office in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's recommendation came on the same day he issued a report
on the status of the U.N. mission in Congo and the deployment of
monitors to verify a cease-fire signed last summer by the warring
sides.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda took up arms in August 1998
to oust President Laurent Kabila from power. Kabila then enlisted
the support of Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia.
</P>
<P>
   In his report, Annan noted progress on some fronts and urged
potential troop contributors to come up with solid commitments for
specialized military units for the observer force and aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   But Annan noted that fighting has been taking place and that
there were indications ''including the purchase of arms and the
recruitment and training of troops by some of the parties, that
they may be preparing for new military activities.''

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Arrives in Greece  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin discussed
cooperation in trade and tourism on the first day of his visit to
Athens Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang's trip to Greece, following visits to the Middle East and
Turkey, comes as China tries to raise its international profile and
play a more active role as a permanent member of the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
   China is also seeking to improve ties with the European Union,
of which Greece is a member, Zhu Bangzao, the Chinese foreign
ministry spokesman, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Current cooperation in economics and technology is good, and
trade between them is growing strongly, said Zhu. China also signed
an agreement with Greece to import a total of 200,000 tons of
aluminum, with the first 40,000 tons, valued at $9 million, being
shipped this year, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang, the first Chinese president to visit Greece, was
reciprocating for a trip to China by Greek President Costis
Stephanopolous.
</P>
<P>
   Greece and China have enjoyed warm ties in recent years, boosted
by Chinese support for the failed Greek bid to gain a non-permanent
seat on the United Nations Security Council in 1998, Greek foreign
ministry officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang also spoke of boosting the tourist trade, saying China is
gradually beginning to allow some of its citizens to travel beyond
its borders.

<HEADLINE> Tewell, Murphy Share Las Vegas Lead  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Doug Tewell, coming off a victory Monday in the
PGA Seniors' Championship, shot a 7-under 65 on Friday for a share
of the first-round lead in the Las Vegas Senior Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was concerned about my intensity,'' said Tewell, the former
TV analyst in his first full season on the senior tour. ''It was
tough to block out all the accolades and get focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Murphy also opened with a 65 on the Tournament Players Club
at Summerlin. Bruce Fleisher, a two-time winner this year who led
the tour with seven victories last season, was a stroke back.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Risch, Leonard Thompson and Larry Nelson shot 67s. Lee
Trevino, the 1992 winner who at age 60 is seeking his first victory
since the 1998 Southwestern Bell Dominion, topped an eight-player
group at 68. Hale Irwin, the 1997 and 1998 winner, shot a 69.
</P>
<P>
   Tewell, 50, a four-time PGA Tour winner who spent three years as
a commentator for The Golf Channel, shot a 5-under 31 on the front
nine. After a bogey on No. 11, he birdied the next three holes to
reach 7-under.
</P>
<P>
   ''My confidence is bubbling over,'' Tewell said. ''I'm trying to
keep it inside and keep collected.''
</P>
<P>
   Tewell, who credited a recent lesson from tour player David
Graham for his success on the greens, made an 18-foot birdie putt
on No. 7 and 15-footers on Nos. 8 and 14.
</P>
<P>
   ''My putting killed me on the regular tour,'' Tewell said.
''David gave me a lesson in Tampa, and it has made all the
difference in the world. I'm a little more upright in my stance and
my eyes are over the ball better. I'm seeing the line a lot
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, 57, an 11-time winner on the senior tour, had an eagle,
seven birdies and two bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had my knee operated on six weeks ago,'' Murphy said. ''I
can move fine to my left side. That's made all the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher eagled the 560-yard, par-5 16th hole, hitting a 5-wood
approach within 3 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ''The course is playing fast and the tees are up,'' said
Fleisher, who birdied the three other par-5s.

Campaign Finance Questions for Clinton, Gore
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As part of a long-running investigation into alleged
fund-raising abuses in the 1996 Clinton-Gore re-election campaign, federal
prosecutors interviewed President Clinton today. The White House said Vice
President Al Gore also was interviewed by the Justice Department Campaign
Finance Task Force this week. Clinton's interview was conducted under oath and
lasted four hours, said a White House official who spoke on condition of
anonymity. Attorney General Janet Reno established the task force to investigate
allegations that illegal foreign and corporate donations were made in the 1996
presidential campaign.

Reno Gets Outside Help on Elian Case
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno worked with outside
intermediaries in Miami today on a possible agreement that would transfer
custody of Elian Gonzalez from his Miami relatives to his father immediately, a
Justice Department spokeswoman said. ''These parties are still working out the
details of such a plan,'' Justice spokeswoman Carole Florman said. ''It has not
been presented to Juan Miguel Gonzalez,'' the 6-year-old shipwreck survivor's
Cuban father. Florman would not identify the intermediaries other than as
members of the Miami community. She said they were in contact with Elian's
great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez and his family, who have defied Reno's order to
transfer Elian.

   TASHKENT, Uzbekistan (AP) -- Leaders of four former Soviet republics in
Central Asia on Friday signed a security pact intended to help contain the flow

across the region. Citing Afghanistan as the ''main source of fanaticism and
extremism in the region,'' Uzbekistan's President Islam Karimov said: ''We have
found ourselves exposed to a powerful ideological expansion.'' Karimov spoke
after signing the treaty with presidents Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakstan,
Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzstan and Emomali Rakhmonov of Tajikistan. The pact calls
for expanding cooperation between the countries' security agencies and envisages
joint military action if one is attacked.

   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia Friday announced it has barred the use of middlemen in

children from the country's often-dismal orphanages. Prospective parents will
now have to come to Russia and clear bureaucratic hurdles themselves, a process
that can take months, deputy Education Minister Yelena Chepurnykh told a news
conference. However, the new rules will allow foreign adoption agencies to apply
for official registration and open offices in Russia, a move some U.S. adoption
workers have said would be beneficial.

<HEADLINE> Concern Grows in Little Havana  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN FARRINGTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Demonstrators gathered in prayer outside the Miami
home of Elian Gonzalez on Good Friday, saying the U.S. government
should not try to force a reunion between the boy and his Cuban
father during the Easter holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Religious icons, flowers and photos of the 6-year-old Cuban boy
were in makeshift shrines throughout heavily Catholic Little
Havana.
</P>
<P>
   One neighbor set up a life-sized statue of St. Lazarus, one of
Cuba's most revered religious symbols. The statue, draped in a
purple cape and propped up by crutches, has photo of Elian at its
feet, next to a printout saying ''God can make the impossible
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   At the home of Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, a painting
of another Cuban saint, the Virgen of Charity of Cobre, hung on the
front door. Cubans say she appears to rafters on their way to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of exiles prayed; others bore 6-foot wooden crosses
representing Jesus' crucifixion on Good Friday. Rosaries and other
religious items decorated the chain-link fence in front of the
house.
</P>
<P>
   Only two days after protesters celebrated a court ruling keeping
Elian in the country for now, some said there was growing concern
that he will soon be taken away by force. The crowd grew to about
600 Friday evening, causing rising tensions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We won a small victory, but we have the worry that immigration
is going to get Elian soon,'' said Ana Silverio, 48, referring to
the Immigration and Naturalization Service. ''We're praying so that
whatever God decides is what happens. I hope they respect these
holy days and they don't come in until after.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Attorney General Janet Reno met at the Justice
Department with the boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, but
declined to provide him with a timetable of what may happen.
</P>
<P>
   The developments in Washington caused rising tension here.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's beginning to build up again unfortunately,'' said Ramon
Saul Sanchez, the president of the anti-Castro Democracy Movement
who urged demonstrators to remain peaceful. ''The sense is that
maybe Monday or Tuesday, but the people are still worried, because
you never know.''

<HEADLINE> Angels 9, Devil Rays 6  </HEADLINE>
By FRED GOODALL, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Mo Vaughn and Tim Salmon ruined Doc
Gooden's homecoming Friday night, hitting back-to-back homers in
the fourth inning and repeating the feat in the ninth against
Roberto Hernandez to give Anaheim a 9-6 victory over the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus also homered twice, connecting off Gooden and
Hernandez (1-2), in the same innings as Vaughn and Salmon. The six
home runs tied an Angels record set on July 14, 1990, against
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn led off the ninth with a homer to right, his third, to
snap a 6-6 tie and finish 3-for-5 with two RBIs. Salmon hit his
third homer of the season to make it 8-6 and Glaus finished a
4-for-5, three RBI night with his fourth homer.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Petkovsek (1-1) pitched 2 1-3 perfect innings to get the
win. Troy Percival pitched the ninth to earn his fifth save.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden allowed six runs in four-plus innings, struck out one and
walked four in his first start in his hometown. The 35-year-old
right-hander grew up in Tampa and has lived in St. Petersburg
during the offseason for much of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn and Salmon homered on consecutive pitches before Glaus
finished Anaheim's four-run fourth inning against Gooden with a
two-run homer that was estimated to be the longest in the short
history of the Devil Rays' domed stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus' drive to left that lodged in a catwalk that helps support
the roof of the stadium. The ball traveled an estimated 470 feet,
surpassing the 468-foot homer Tampa Bay's Fred McGriff hit against
Kansas City on May 5, 1999 as the longest ever at Tropicana Field.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Williams keyed a four-run fourth inning for Tampa Bay
with a two-run double. McGriff had a sacrifice fly and shortstop
Benji Gil's error allowed another run to score.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden was obtained from Houston for cash April 13 and pitched
six scoreless innings to beat the Detroit Tigers in his Devil Rays
debut two days later. He retired the first eight batter he faced
before running into trouble against the Angels.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The game drew a crowd of 22,221, including a club-record
walkup sales of 5,700. ... Salmon homered for the first time since
April 3. Four of his five RBIs have come in the last two games ...
The Angels hit three home runs in an inning for the first time
since Salmon, Jim Edmonds and Tony Phillips did it on July 11, 1997
at Oakland. ... The start was the 399th of Gooden's career, which
includes stints with the Mets, Yankees and Indians. ... 3B Herbert
Perry, designated for assignment by the Devil Rays on April 12, was
claimed on waivers by the White Sox.

<HEADLINE> White Sox 7, Tigers 2  </HEADLINE>
By RICK GANO, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Frank Thomas homered and the Chicago White Sox
used a five-run fifth inning Friday night to beat Detroit 7-2,
sending the reeling Tigers to their fifth straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers, shut out in their previous two games, ended a
scoreless streak of 24 innings with a first-inning run, but lost
for the 11th time in 15 games, the worst record in the American
League.
</P>
<P>
   Kip Wells (1-2), in his fourth start this season, finally got
his first win. He gave up a solo homer to Juan Encarnacion and
allowed seven hits in 6 1-3 innings with two walks and five
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   An error by shortstop Deivi Cruz got the White Sox's big inning
rolling. Josh Paul doubled to start the fifth and scored when Cruz
hit him with his throw to third after fielding Ray Durham's
grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Walks to Jose Valentin and Thomas loaded the bases and finished
C.J. Nitkowski (1-3) in favor of Matt Anderson. Magglio Ordonez
then hit a hopper to short that went for an RBI infield single when
Cruz couldn't handle the ball. Chris Singleton followed with a
two-run single and Carlos Lee hit a sacrifice fly to make it 7-2
</P>
<P>
   Luis Polonia drew a walk leading off the game, moved to second
on Wells' errant pickoff throw and scored on Greg Jefferies double
that ended Detroit's scoreless streak at 24 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago tied it in the second on singles by Singleton, Craig
Wilson and Paul.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas homered in the third, his fourth of the season, and
Encarnacion retied the game with his third homer in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Chicago's 10-6 record is its best through 16 games since
1994 when it had an identical mark. ...Game-time temperature was
just 49 degrees with a northeasterly wind at 13 mph creating a wind
chill of 24. Sox 1B Paul Konerko created a strange look to combat
the conditions. As is his custom, he had his black socks pulled
high above his ankles and for several innings wore a white hood
underneath his black cap. ....Detroit is 1-6 on the road this
season and has lost six straight... Jeff Weaver, the Tigers'
starter on Saturday, was the first pitcher to make the majors from
the 1998 draft. Wells, who was 4-1 when called up last season, was
the second. Wells celebrated his 23rd birthday Friday. ... In
addition to his 400-foot-plus homer to center, Thomas also walked
three times.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Barry Larkin tore a finger ligament and went
into surgery, Ken Griffey Jr. hurt his back and Cincinnati's
pitching staff stumbled again, completing an all-around miserable
night for the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hundley homered and Kevin Elster hit a ninth-inning grand
slam off Norm Charlton on Friday night as the Los Angeles Dodgers
took advantage of the Reds' mounting woes for a 9-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin, the Reds' shortstop and captain, tore a ligament in the
middle finger of his glove hand while diving for Mark
Grudzielanek's two-run single in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin's glove caught on the artificial turf as he dove,
twisting his hand. He immediately went to a hospital for surgery
and will be out for two-to-four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   His injury came two days after first baseman Sean Casey returned
from a broken right thumb sustained in the final exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   There was more. Griffey hurt his back, evidently while diving
for a ball in centerfield in the second inning, and frequently bent
over to stretch during the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey was 1-for-3 with a double and a pair of walks and could
only jog out a fourth-inning grounder, but played the entire game.
A trainer came out to talk with him after one painful swing in the
second inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers overcame a ragged start by Eric Gagne to win a game
that will be remembered more for the subplots. It started 27
minutes late because clubhouse attendants had to go on a
last-minute shopping spree when the umpires' equipment got
misdirected to New York.
</P>

raw night, both starting pitchers struggled with their control and
the cold, frequently blowing on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Herges (1-0) got his first major league win by pitching 2
2-3 hitless innings in relief of Gagne, who threw 117 pitches in 4
1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Elster topped it off with a ninth-inning slam off Charlton, who
walked the bases loaded before giving up the first-pitch homer in
his first appearance for the Reds since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Parris (1-3) had a bases-loaded double in the second for
both of Cincinnati's runs, but lasted only two-plus innings. The
right-hander gave up seven hits and two walks, needing 46 pitches
to get through the second inning alone, as his ERA climbed to 8.47.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley, only 2-for-14 on the Dodgers' recent homestand, led off
the second with his third homer. Grudzielanek's single up the
middle that eluded Larkin made it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Parris' first double since 1995 cut it to 3-2 in the bottom of
the inning as Gagne struggled almost as much. The right-hander
threw 43 pitches in his half-inning.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles made it 5-2 in the third when Adrian Beltre got a
two-run single on a ball that deflected off the glove of reliever
Scott Sullivan and rolled through the hole at shortstop.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Gagne had an embarrassing moment in the seventh, when he
came to bat and went to first base on what he mistakenly thought
was ball four. He was summoned back to home and struck out on the
next pitch. ... Gagne struck out eight, matching his career high.
... Kevin Elster hit his third career grand slam, first since 1996.
... Larkin singled in the first inning and got the 350th stolen
base of his career. ... The helmet that Griffey wore when he hit
his 400th homer in Colorado is heading to baseball's Hall of Fame.
... The Reds threw two more wild pitches, giving them 17 in 17
games -- most in the majors.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Woody Williams allowed one run and four hits in
seven innings to beat Houston for the second time in six days,
leading the San Diego Padres over the Astros 7-2 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko, Bret Boone and Damian Jackson each doubled twice
for the Padres, and Phil Nevin doubled once.
</P>
<P>
   Wiki Gonzalez had three RBIs, and Klesko and Boone each scored
three runs, with Boone going 3-for-4 and Klesko 2-for-4.
</P>
<P>
   The game drew 42,092, the largest crowd thus far at Enron Field.
</P>
<P>
   Williams (3-1), making his second career start in his hometown,
struck out seven and walked five.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Lima (1-3) allowed five runs and eight hits -- including
five doubles -- in five innings. His ERA rose to 5.88.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, 2-5 at their new ballpark, returned following a
five-game road trip. Temporary padding 8 inches high was installed
along the fence in front of the left-field bullpen, but the
concrete curb is still hazardous.
</P>
<P>
   Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker wants a 3-foot-high pad
installed, similar to the one by the right-field bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego took a 2-0 lead in the second on Boone's RBI double
and Gonzalez's run-scoring grounder. Klesko hit an RBI double in
the fourth and scored on Eric Owens' single, and Williams'
sacrifice fly made it 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell hit his fifth home run leading off the sixth,
365-footer to left that was the 25th homer in seven games at Enron.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez hit a two-run single in the eighth off Jose Cabrera to
make it 7-1. Tony Eusebio had a sacrifice fly in the bottom half
off Carlos Almanzar, and Trevor Hoffman pitched the ninth to
complete the six-hitter.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Scott Elarton will make his season debut Sunday, pitching
against San Diego's Brian Meadows. Elarton has been rehabbing from
offseason rotator cuff surgery. ... The Astros announced that
40,950 is the revised seating capacity for Enron Field, a decrease
of 1,050 because of obstructed views. However, standing room
tickets may be sold. ... .. Tony Gwynn needs one single for 2,331,
which would move him into 10th place on the career list ... The
Padres are 1-6 in one-run games after going 28-25 last season.

<HEADLINE> Ex-H. Rap Brown Facing Charges  </HEADLINE>
By ASHLEY ESTES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, the 1960s black
militant formerly known as H. Rap Brown, returned to Atlanta on
Friday to face charges he killed an Atlanta sheriff's deputy.
</P>
<P>
   He was being held in the Cobb County Jail in Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin, 56, is accused of shooting Ricky Kinchen to death and
wounding Deputy Aldranon English. The two officers were trying to
arrest Al-Amin at his grocery store when the shooting occurred
March 16. Al-Amin was captured four days later in Alabama, and had
opposed extradition back to Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney J.L. Chestnut said they withdrew their
objections because the ''hysteria'' surrounding Al-Amin's arrest
had eased and he now feels ''relatively safe going back to
Georgia.'' Chestnut said his client was ready to return to Georgia,
''where the real fight is.''
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut said there had been more emotionalism about Al-Amin
than about the convicted Oklahoma City bomber.
</P>
<P>
   ''This sort of hysteria did not surround Tim McVeigh,'' Chestnut
said after an extradition hearing. ''I have never understood that
sort of foolishness ... I was not about to rush him back.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said matters in Georgia ''fell into place'' and a joint
decision was made during a recess at the hearing to return without
further litigation. He was returned to Georgia by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys have described Al-Amin as a peace-loving
Muslim cleric and neighborhood activist who was framed for murder
after he angered Atlanta's organized crime bosses and corrupt
police officers by trying to stop prostitution in a black
community.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Paul Howard has called Al-Amin's conspiracy claims
ridiculous.

<HEADLINE> Honduras Soccer Team Ends Boycott  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HERSHEY, Pa. (AP) -- The Honduran soccer team still had not paid
promised bonuses as of Friday night's game, the coach said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It certainly had an impact. It kind of gave the team an anemic
effect,'' coach Ramon Enrique Maradiaga said through an
interpreter. The team lost its first game of the Olympic qualifying
tournament to the United States 3-0. ''There is no doubt that some
of the players were treated badly, and then coming here late had an
effect on their play.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach said, however, that the federation was still promising
to make the payments.
</P>
<P>
   The players had refused to travel to the United States unless
they were paid promised bonuses. On Thursday, the team promised to
make payment in Hershey, said Lisandro Flores Guillen, president of
Honduras National Federation. The Hondurans then traveled to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Honduran soccer federation also lifted its two-year
suspension of 16 of the 18 players on the Olympic team who
threatened to boycott. The federation initially said the players
had done irreparable damage to Honduran soccer.
</P>
<P>
   The players demanded bonuses of $1,500 each the federation
promised if they made it to the final round of the Olympic
qualifying tournament. The team did that by placing second in a
four-team round-robin in Mexico two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Honduras is one of six teams in the tournament from which two
nations will win spots for the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Honduras is grouped with the United States and Canada. The other
group is made up of Guatemala, Mexico and Panama.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Team Wins Marbles Tournament  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TINSLEY GREEN, England (AP) -- An American dream team captured
the International Cup in a marbles tournament Friday, defeating the
English champs at a village pub.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was America's first in the contest since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really shot some unbelievable marbles,'' coach Jeff Kimmell
said after the eight-hour event. ''We're getting ready to go
celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans were undefeated through six games, said Sam
McCarthy-Fox, secretary of the British Marble Board of Control,
which organizes the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Kimmell, 32, a computer network engineer and former national
marbles champion from Middletown, Md., hand-picked and rigorously
trained the team of 10, most of them teen-agers, from Maryland,
Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Winners receive no cash, but Kimmell hopes his team's success
will bolster his quest to have team marbles made a demonstration
sport in the 2004 Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. players included six former winners of the U.S.
National Marbles Tournament held each June in Wildwood, N.J. They
ranged in age from 15 to 35 and hailed from Maryland, Pennsylvania
and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The annual tournament held outside The Greyhound pub in Tinsley
Green, West Sussex, drew a crowd of about 500 to watch the best of
players at an ancient game that is believed to have come to Britain
with the invading Romans a couple of thousand years ago.

<HEADLINE> Teens Shot on Good Friday Pilgrimage  </HEADLINE>
By DEBORAH BAKER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHIMAYO, N.M. (AP) -- A teen-age couple making a Good Friday
pilgrimage to a church that is said to contain healing dirt were
found shot to death along one of the most popular routes for the
annual trek to the Roman Catholic shrine.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't recall there being an incident like this'' during the
annual journey, said state police Capt. Carlos Maldonado.
</P>
<P>
   The first victim, 17-year-old Richard Martinez, was found lying
on a highway before daybreak about 30 miles north of Santa Fe. The
second victim was his girlfriend, Karen Castanon of Arroyo Seco,
believed to also be 17. Her body was found several miles away from
Martinez's body. Both were students at Los Alamos High School.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths were being investigated as homicides, but police had
no suspects, said state police Sgt. Royleen Ross-Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point, we are making a public plea for anyone to come
forward with any information. ... We suspect there were people
(other pilgrims) in the area,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The slain boy's father, Ray Martinez, told The Associated Press
that his son was a good student, active in sports and very
religious.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a beautiful kid, now he's gone. I'm still in shock,''
he said while sitting in his son's bedroom at the family home in La
Villita.
</P>
<P>
   One photo in the room showed the high school sweethearts
kissing. The engraved wooden frame read, ''this moment will last
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy's mother, Gerri Martinez, said: ''My son was perfect. He
didn't have any enemies. He was the light of our life. ... My baby
didn't deserve this.''
</P>
<P>
   Pilgrims and other travelers were diverted around the
yellow-taped crime scene for several hours. Police cut a fence and
sent pilgrims through a field. Traffic was rerouted onto another
highway.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of people each year journey to El Santuario de
Chimayo. Good Friday is the most popular day for the pilgrimage.
Last year, an estimated 65,000 visited the Roman Catholic church
during Holy Week.
</P>
<P>
   By midday Friday, pilgrims had already packed the small adobe
church. Many arrived carrying wooden crosses or lilies. Some had
walked only a mile or two; others had been on the road for two or
three days.
</P>
<P>
   The draw is a room with a small hole whose dirt is thought to
possess healing power. The room is filled with crutches and canes
left behind by visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Gonzales of Santa Fe said she has been coming to the
church since she was a small child with eczema on her knees and
elbows.
</P>
<P>
   ''My parents brought me the holy dirt for the bleeding and
itching. I rubbed the dirt on my skin, and it made the itching
stop,'' she said. ''It's not about the dirt making miracles, but
the faith you must have to make it come true.''

<HEADLINE> Koreas Meet To Prepare For Summit  </HEADLINE>
By SANG-HUN CHOE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) -- Negotiators from South Korea and North
Korea met Saturday to prepare for the first-ever summit by their
leaders, an event that would be the biggest diplomatic breakthrough
in more than half a century of division.
</P>
<P>
   In the 80-minute meeting, North Korean envoys asked for a recess
after listening to South Korean proposals for the agenda and other
procedural matters. The two sides plan to meet again Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first meeting between representatives from the two
Koreas since they announced last week plans for a summit in the
North's capital, Pyongyang, on June 12-14. South Korean President
Kim Dae-jung and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il will take part.
</P>
<P>
   The Koreas were divided at the end of World War II, then went to
war five years later. They signed an armistice, rather than a
permanent peace treaty, at the end of the Korean War in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare scene in Panmunjom, a truce village inside the
Demilitarized Zone that separates the two sides, several dozen
North Korean officials and reporters walked across the border to
meet their South Korean counterparts. Some were smiling.
</P>
<P>
   After remarking on the warm spring weather and rice planting,
the delegates went behind closed doors for talks on the agenda and
other issues, including security and communications.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the South Korean proposals were not made public. But
before the meeting, Yang Young-shik, the chief South Korean
negotiator, said the two Koreas should prosper through economic
cooperation and appealed for help to reunite separated family
members from the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Young Sung, the chief North Korean delegate, responded:
''There are many pending issues between the two sides. For their
smooth solution, there must be a solution to more basic issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim did not elaborate. But topics raised by North Korea in past
talks include the U.S. military presence in South Korea and the
abolition of South Korea's anti-communist security laws.
</P>
<P>
   Before crossing the border Saturday, the North Koreans were
given a written South Korean assurance for their safety, a standard
operating procedure in such inter-Korean contacts.
</P>
<P>
   Three North Korean delegates, accompanied by three assistants,
met an equal number of South Korean officials at Peace House, an
administrative building in the southern sector of the neutral
border village.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's agreement to hold the contact at the border
village was surprising. No inter-Korean border contact had been
held since the summer of 1994 when the two sides met to prepare a
summit.
</P>
<P>
   That summit was canceled because of the sudden death of North
Korean leader Kim Il Sung. Relations between the two Koreas
worsened afterward, and Pyongyang shunned border talks with Seoul.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Kevin Jarvis won his first major league game in
3{ years and Todd Helton hit a three-run homer in the first inning
Friday night as the Colorado Rockies beat the St. Louis Cardinals
6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis (1-0), brought up from the minor leagues earlier in the
day, gave up four runs and nine hits in 6 2-3 innings, improving
his career record to 13-19. He hadn't won in the major leagues
since beating the Chicago Cubs for Cincinnati on Sept. 26, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis retired 11 consecutive batters starting in the third.
Jose Jimenez got five outs for his second save.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire was 2-for-4 with two singles and an RBI after
missing seven straight games because of back pain. He has missed
nine of the Cardinals' 17 games.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Hentgen (3-1) gave up six runs, eight hits and four walks in
six innings. The Cardinals, 8-2 at home this year, are 4-4 overall
in their last eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado, which won for the sixth time in nine games, took a 4-0
lead in the first on Larry Walker's RBI single and Helton's fifth
home run -- Colorado's first homer in 33 innings.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire singled in a run in the bottom half, but Jeff Cirillo's
two-run single made it 6-1 in the second. Fernando Vina had an RBI
single in the bottom of the second, and Fernando Tatis hit a
two-run homer in the third. St. Louis has homered in 13 consecutive
games.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Darren Bragg is 2-for-20. ... Helton has hit safely in 17
of Colorado's 18 games. ... The Cardinals are 11-0 when not making
an error, 0-6 when they do. ... St. Louis is 0-3 on Fridays this
year. ... The Cardinals need one more home run in April to tie the
record for 41 home runs in the month, set by the Atlanta Braves in
1998.

<HEADLINE> Ruiz Wins 3-Meter Diving Title  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Mark Ruiz, the two-time U.S. diver of the
year, won the 3-meter springboard title Friday in the U.S. National
Indoor Diving Championships for his 14th national title.
</P>
<P>
   The Puerto Rico native received two 8.5s and two 8.0s on his
final dive -- a reverse 3{ summersault with a one-half twist tuck --
to edge David Pichler.
</P>
<P>
   ''I looked at the scoreboard and I was at 650,'' Ruiz said.
''Then I looked at David's score (649.26), because I wasn't totally
sure if I had won. Once I checked out the scores, I was all
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Going into the last two dives, I still knew I had a good
chance. I saw the scores, and I knew exactly what I needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz was the star of the championships a year ago, becoming the
first to sweep all three men's springboard titles since Olympic
gold medalist Greg Louganis in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   But this week has been rough for Ruiz. A nagging groin injury
was compounded by fatigue when Ruiz flew to Minneapolis last
Saturday, less than a day after escorting his girlfriend to her
senior prom in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been tired, and I pulled the groin again on my third
dive,'' he said. ''But I really wanted to win this week. It was a
good last dive, you can't get any better than that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Reiling, of Roseville, Minn., was the surprise winner in
the 4-meter competition. Reiling's fourth dive, a reverse 2{
summersault, earned two scores of 9.5 and four at 9.0.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew it was a fairly good dive, but I came up and I did not
believe my score,'' she said. ''I was shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Reiling finished with 499.83 points, with Ashley Culpepper, of
Baton Rouge, La., second at 493.14.
</P>
<P>
   Lauryn McCalley and Lane Bassham won the women's synchronized
3-meter championship. They combined to score 286.20 points,
finishing ahead of Kathy Pesek and Tracy Bonner.

<HEADLINE> Twins 10, Rangers 5  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN HAWKINS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Ron Coomer had two homers and seven RBIs
as the Minnesota Twins beat Texas 10-5 on Friday night for their
first win against the Rangers since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota, which has won four straight, lost all 12 games to
Texas in 1999, and 13 in a row in the series since September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Coomer hit a two-run homer in the third inning to tie the game
at 3 and added a three-run shot in the ninth. He added an RBI
single in a three-run sixth that put the Twins ahead to stay, and
then drove in another run on a groundout an inning later.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, swept in a three-game series against the New York Yankees
earlier this week, lost five straight for the first time since July
12-16, 1998. The Rangers blew a 3-0 first-inning lead, and then
failed to hold on after going ahead 5-3 in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota chased Texas starter Mark Clark (2-1) with its
sixth-inning rally.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who had won his first seven career decisions against the
Twins, left the game after Coomer's RBI single tied the game at 5.
Coomer scored the go-ahead run on a groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Clark gave up six runs and six hits in five-plus innings. He
struck out two and walked one.
</P>
<P>
   Hector Carrasco (3-1) pitched 2 1-3 shutout innings for the win.
</P>
<P>
   Texas led 2-0 in the first when Ivan Rodriguez hit a two-run
homer, his sixth of the season. Rodriguez had also homered in his
previous at-bat, the first pinch-hit homer of his career with two
outs in the bottom of ninth of Wednesday's 5-4, 10-inning loss to
the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Palmeiro, just 2-for-20 in the previous five games,
followed with a double and scored on Frank Catalnotto's double to
make it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro was thrown out at the plate to end the seventh inning
while trying to score on Ruben Mateo's double. Palmeiro apparently
beat the throw, but was pushed away from the plate by Minnesota
catcher Marcus Jensen.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota tied the game at 3 on a pair of homers, Jensen's solo
shot in the third and Coomer's two-run shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers regained the lead on back-to-back RBI singles by
Mateo and Catalanotto in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Coomer has seven career multihomer games. ... Texas
shortstop Royce Clayton, who had batted .164 in the leadoff spot
the first 14 games, was moved to the No. 9 spot and went 3-for-4.
Luis Alicea was 1-for-4 in the top spot and grounded into two
double plays. ... For the first time in eight games, the Rangers
didn't face a starting pitcher who had won at least 12 games last
season. Joe Mays was 6-11 last season. ... Mays gave up runs in the
first inning in his third straight start. He gave up five in the
first inning of a 5-0 loss to Baltimore on Sunday, and two at
Boston in a 7-3 loss on April 11.

   HERSHEY, Pa. (AP) -- The United States got off to a strong start
in its quest for an Olympic berth as Chris Albright scored two
goals in a 3-0 victory over Honduras on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, losers of its last two matches against
Honduras, easily avenged those defeats in the final round of
qualifying for the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the teams met, Honduras defeated an inexperienced
U.S. team in the opening round of the 1999 Pan American Games. The
United States also fell to Honduras in the 1995 Pan Ams.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, a forward for the MLS champion D.C. United, put the
United States ahead in the 37th minute. Midfielder Ben Olsen
gathered up a loose ball and sprinted up the right sideline,
passing the ahead to Albright, who was racing alongside Olsen.
</P>
<P>
   Albright blasted a shot past goalkeeper Belarmino Rivera and
into the right side of the net.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was going to go for the ball first, but Benny is better at
handling and passing the ball, so I figured I would try to get on
the end of it,'' Albright said. ''I just made a run near-post, and
he played a beautiful ball and I just got my foot on it.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. goalkeeper Adin Brown was spectacular in the opening
minutes of the second half, stopping shots from forwards Orvin
Cabrera and Luis Ramirez from directly in front of the net. Brown
credited his defense for thwarting the Honduran attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''They played real well,'' Brown said of his defenders. ''I only
had to deal with three or four shots from about 30 or 40 yards out,
and you're going to deal with them all the time. They're pretty
regular shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown had two saves in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Albright got his second goal in the 77th, pouncing on John
Thorrington's shot, which deflected off Rivera and directly to
Albright, who placed it in the left side of the goal.
</P>
<P>
   Thorrington added the final U.S. goal when Olsen delivered a
pass for his second assist of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Honduras plays Canada in a second-round matchup on Sunday, while
the United States will take on Canada on Tuesday night. With a win
over Canada, the United States will reach the semifinals. A win in
the semifinals will ensure the team a trip to Sydney.
