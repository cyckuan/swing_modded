<P>
MOSCOW, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeni
Primakov flew to Washington today for a three-day official visit
to the United States, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
This trip was believed to prepare for the upcoming
Russia-U.S. summit in Helsinki scheduled for March 19-21.
</P>
<P>
Primakov's scheduled meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton
on March 17 was put in doubt since Clinton is suffering a serious
knee tendon injury.
</P>
<P>
Clinton tore his knee tendon on the Florida estate of golfer
Greg Norman and underwent a surgery on Friday.
</P>
<P>
But Itar-Tass was assured at the White House office in
Washington that the summit meeting will not be called off.
</P>
<P>
Primakov will also meet with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright.
</P>
<P>
The main topic of these talks will be European security
problems and the START-ABM package.
</P>
<P>
Russia holds strong opposition to NATO's eastward expansion
plans, but hopes to reach a compromise at the Helsinki summit.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennadi Tarasov was quoted
as saying that during the visit Primakov plans to discuss issues
concerning strategic weapons.
</P>
<P>
They will also address such issues as cooperation in chemical
disarmament, settlement of regional crises and economic
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> "I Saw Labe's Diaries and Photos," Says Chinese Academician </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A famous Chinese science
academician today provided new evidence that atrocities were
committed by the Japanese troops during the Nanjing Massacre about
60 years ago.
</P>
<P>
He Zehui is the wife of Qian Sanqiang, China's father of atomic
bombs. Madame He, herself a scientist in high-energy physics, told
the Chinese and Japanese press today that she had seen the diaries
of John Labe, a German who worked in Nanjing in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
Labe was then the chief representative of the German Siemens
company in China. His diaries and photos depicting Japanese
atrocities in the Nanjing Massacre were recently made public by
his granddaughter, Madame Reinhardt.
</P>
<P>
"I knew Labe," said the 83-year-old He. "I saw his diaries and
the photos he had kept."
</P>
<P>
It was around 1941 when she, as a young girl with pigtails, had
no option but to work in a Siemens lab because the Nazi government
forbade foreign scholars from leaving Germany after the start of
World War II.
</P>
<P>
After graduating from Qinghua University, she arrived in Berlin
in 1936 to study for a Ph.D. in ballistics, aware of the dire need
for technology to arm Chinese troops against Japanese invaders.
</P>
<P>
"I got to know Labe soon after I came to Siemens," she said.
"Labe was around 60 and just came back from China. He loved China
and the Chinese people."
</P>
<P>
"As I became a frequent visitor to his home, Labe showed me his
diaries and photos and told me what he saw during the massacre of
Nanjing," Madame He said.
</P>
<P>
"Labe said the Japanese were inhuman," she recalled.
</P>
<P>
She remembered that the diaries were several heavy books, and
the photos showed Chinese civilians and soldiers bein=g murdered,
buried alive or decapitated. She was shocked and outraged.
</P>
<P>
She said Madame Reinhardt was then barely 10 years old. After
the Nazi troops were overtaken by the Allied troops, and Berlin
was bombed and no longer safe, she left to work in a research
institute in south Germany and has since lost contact with the
Labe's.
</P>
<P>
Last December, the appearance of Labe's diaries and photos was
widely reported by Chinese media. Madame He didn't believe Labe
was the man she knew until she saw a picture of him on television.
</P>
<P>
"It is Labe!" she exclaimed. "Sixty years have passed, but I
recognized him as soon as I saw his picture."
</P>
<P>
Madame He, who has always avoided the media glare, today met
with reporters. "The Japanese right-wingers attempted to deny the
Nanjing Massacre, however, the history that was written in blood
cannot be erased, and Labe's diary is ironclad proof," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I regret that I don't have any photographs of me with Mr. Labe
to prove what I said," she said. "Had I had enough foresight to
see that the Japanese right-wingers would deny and distort history
in this way, I would have taken some."
</P>
<P>
Madame He left Germany for France in 1946; there, she married
Qian. She then worked at the Lab of Nuclear Chemistry of the
College of France, and the Lab of Curie.
</P>
<P>
The 83-year-old He is regarded as "China's Madam Curie" for her
discovery of ternary fission and quarto fission.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka vows to Reduce Loadshedding in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A Bangladeshi minister today cited
the problems in gas supply as the main reason behind the present
power shortage and vowed to reduce the ever-increasing countrywide
loadshedding in April.
</P>
<P>
"The situation would begin to improve when the
Ashuganj-Bakharabad Gas Pipeline would be commissioned in April,"
Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Noor Uddin Khan told a press
conference here today.
</P>
<P>
Khan said the available electricity now can only meet 82.5
percent of the peak hour demand. To meet the shortfall, he
announced a series of short- and medium-term measures to increase
the generation of electricity.
</P>
<P>
Rehabilitation works in all power plants would be completed
next June and three barge-mounted power plants are expected to be
commissioned within the next year, adding more power to the
national grid.
</P>
<P>
To reduce the peak hour demands, The capital Dhaka city
government has announced measures to close the commercial and
shopping centers after 7 pm, impose bans on ceremonial
illumination and stagger industrial holidays to distribute the
power loads over the week.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges Saudi Arabia to Allow Anti-U.S. Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today urged Saudi Arabia to lift ban on anti-U.S. and
anti-Israel rally during a Muslim pilgrimage in Mecca next month.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi authorities have warned that political activities
will not be tolerated during the Hajji.
</P>
<P>
The president was also quoted by Iran's official news agency
IRNA as saying that "At a time when the world of Islam is
suffering from division among Muslim nations, Hajji serves as a
means to help bring about unity among them."
</P>
<P>
At a recent meeting with officials in charge of Hajji
pilgrimage, Rafsanjani urged them to work hard to foster unity
among Muslim nations all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said last week that
"expressing hatred and scorn for the disavowal of enemies of
Islam is important and necessary."
</P>
<P>
Such demonstrations have previously led to tense situations and
even bloody confrontations with the Saudi security forces. In
1987, more than 400 people were killed in clashes between Iranian
demonstrators and Saudi forces. The two countries broke off
relations from 1988 to 1991.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi authorities kept a close watch on Iranian pilgrims in
past years, trying to prevent them from holding any rallies in
public.
</P>
<P>
Iran is expected to send about 70,000 pilgrims as part of a
quota set by the Saudi authorities on all Muslim countries.

<HEADLINE> OAPEC Oil Conference Opens in Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 15 (Xinhua) -- A five-day bi-annual
conference of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OAPEC) on oil exploration, prosecution, refining and
petro-chemical industries opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, OAPEC Secretary-General
Abdel Aziz Al-Turki said the oil industry of the OAPEC has
realized marked progress in the fields of exploration,
industrialization, transport and marketing, overcoming many
difficulties and problems.
</P>
<P>
He told 40 oil officials and experts from various Arab
oil producing countries that the oil industry was undergoing
tremendous technological developments in exploration, prospecting,
and other fields such as refining, transport, storage and
marketing.
</P>
<P>
Al-Turki described 1996 as one of the good years in world oil
demand and price increases, saying it was necessary to follow up
market development to ensure a continued development in oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the importance of developing the capabilities
of oil workers through intensive training and exchange of
information.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwait-based OAPEC, which was founded in January, 1968, is
a regional inter-governmental organization concerned with the
development of the petroleum industry through fostering
cooperation among its members. It consists of 10 Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
It has a collective total proven oil reserve of 636.2
billion barrels, amounting to 60.84 percent of the total world
oil reserve of 1045.7 billion barrels.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the 15th of its kind since the establishment of
the organization, will deal topics such as exploration,
prosecution, refining and petro-chemical industries.
</P>
<P>
The participants will also discuss matters of oil and
development in the Arab world, make analysis of the world
market, oil and energy consumption and the investment of oil
returns in joint Arab projects.
</P>
<P>
Recent studies indicated that world oil consumption last year
increased by 3 percent to record 2.1 million barrels
daily. During the next 15 years, the world oil demand is expected
to be on an average annual increase of 5 percent.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Rebel Leader Said to Be Under House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Sierra Leoneang rebel leader
Foday Sanko has been put under house arrest in this Nigerian
city, a report here said today.
</P>
<P>
The news, however, could not be confirmed at this moment, as
neither the Nigerian Defense Headquarters nor the Sierra Leonean
High Commission here are available for comment at this moment.
</P>
<P>
The same report also quoted a senior member of Sanko's
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) as saying in a statement today
that the high command of RUF has declared with immediate effect
to sack Sanko as its leader for blocking the peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, the Nigerian Defense Headquarters on Tuesday denied
holding Sanko for anything incriminating while confirming the
presence of Sanko in Nigeria for a private visit.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Headquarters also dismissed reports that Sanko came
in with any ammunition as widely reported, adding that he was
free to enter into the country as a West African national.
</P>
<P>
"He's not in detention and he's not a threat to our security,"
a defense spokesman of the headquarters said. He noted that Sanko
is at the federal government guest house.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has been in good relations with Sierra Leone. It was
only on last Friday that the two countries recently signed a
military agreement, under which Nigeria will help train Sierra
Leone's security agencies, including that country's Army, Navy,
Air Force and Police.

<HEADLINE> NEWS Analysis: A Daunting Task Facing Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government is
facing an uphill task of lifting the national economy out of the
current depression, as the debt crisis is becoming worsening.
</P>
<P>
The coming weeks and months are going to be crucial for the
government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in financial terms. The
cost of debt servicing may eat up all or most of Pakistan's meager
foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures available here show that Pakistan's foreign debt
in the current fiscal year has exceeded an astonishing 30 billion
US dollars, an increase of almost two billion dollars over the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in rupee terms, Pakistan's internal debt has risen
to 1.089 trillion rupees, equivalent to 27 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Because of the ever-increasing heavy debt service payments, the
net gains or transfer of foreign credit over the last few years
have been declining sharply, coming down from 1.36 billion dollars
in 1988-89 to a mere 388 million dollars in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, remittances from overseas Pakistanis, which once
played a significant role in bridging the gap of the balance of
payments, are shrinking fast, going down from three billion
dollars a decade ago to less than two billion dollars now.
</P>
<P>
Debt servicing is the single largest item of expenditure in the
federal budget. In 1995-96 it amounted to 193.1 billion rupees
(about 4.9 billion dollars), accounting for more than half of the
total revenue, almost 38 percent of total expenditure and 46.3
percent of current expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Persistent current account and fiscal deficits which are
financed by domestic borrowing have eventually led to a high
debt-GDP ratio of 89 percent.
</P>
<P>
The consequences of this persistent borrowing are that every
citizen of Pakistan is now indebted to the tune of 17,000 rupees
(424 dollars) while the per capita income in Pakistan is only
14,927 rupees (372 dollars) at present.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, who assumed his premiership on February 17, has mounted
a massive and innovative effort to unburden the nation of the huge
debt portfolio by asking the people both at home and abroad to
contribute generously towards the specially created accounts for
this purpose.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, who came to power after sitting three years on the
opposition bench, has identified the debt as public enemy number
one of Pakistan and has urged the nation to contribute to his Debt
Retirement Fund.
</P>
<P>
While It is encouraging that the government is giving top
priority to the debt problem, there is still some doubt as to
whether Sharif's call would generate enough money to repay all or
a substantial part of the mounting debt for which the present
government is equally responsible.
</P>
<P>
The people's initial response to the Fund is encouraging,
although exact figures are not available yet.
</P>
<P>
However, given the hefty amount of debt burden, the role of
these contributions will be only marginal, not to mention the
short-term high interests the government has to pay.
</P>
<P>
With 1.2 billion dollars due to be paid this month, the
government is left with no choice but to borrow at least one
billion dollar in short-term loans.
</P>
<P>
One of the main causes of the rising foreign debt is the trade
deficit which stood at 3.5 billion dollars in the last fiscal
year. The primary source of meeting the debt is foreign investment
which remains at around one billion dollars, much lower than
needed.
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit is blamed for the debt. In the last fiscal
year, the government had planned to borrow only 42 billion rupees
(1.04 billion dollars) from domestic market to meet the budget
deficit, but the sum has already crossed the 100 billion rupee
mark and may reach 150 billion rupees (3.75 billion dollars) in
the next few months.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that to improve the trade deficit
situation, the only option is to increase exports by enhancing the
competitiveness of Pakistani goods in the international market.
Pakistan, however, has a very long way to go in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The present government is now taking all possible measures to
revitalize the economy. Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz has said the
revival of the industrial sector and speedy growth in agriculture
and manufacturing on a large scale are the top priority of the new
government.
</P>
<P>
"Productivity and Production" can ensure high growth rate,
larger exports and more jobs, thus yielding more revenues to
gradually lessen the budget deficit and foreign debt, said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Most economists here agree that increased production and
productivity can solve the problems in the long term. But the
question is that Pakistan's economic position seems too fragile to
stand that long.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, heavy cuts in non-development expenditure may be the
only way to lay a solid foundation for the country's long-term
goal.
</P>
<P>
As the defense budget of 133 billion rupees (3.32 billion
dollars) -- the second biggest drag on resources -- may not be
curtailed, the choices of the new government are limited.
</P>
<P>
Much would depend on whether the new government will be in a
position to take tough decisions instead of resorting only to
stopgap measures, the analysts said.

<HEADLINE> EU Divided on Calls for Albania Military Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
APELDOORN, Netherlands, March 15 (Xinhua) -- European Union
foreign ministers, convening an informal meeting in the Dutch town
of Apeldoorn, were divided on Saturday on whether to back calls
for military intervention in the chaotic Albania.
</P>
<P>
Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersem, whose country
holds the OSCE presidency, said his country was infavour of having
the international community put together a force.
</P>
<P>
According to Dutch EU presidency sources, Danmark's position
was supported by Spain and Austria.
</P>
<P>
But British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifking told reporters as
he arrived for the meeting it was "premature" to think about such
a move, a stance which was shared by his German colleague Klaus
Kinkel.
</P>
<P>
Sweden's Lena Hjelm-Wallen was blunt about the EU's
predicament. "Frankly, we don't know what to do," she told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van Mierlo, hosting the Apeldoorn
meeting, said the EU was not ruling anything out and that his
colleagues would be considering a number of options.
</P>
<P>
OSCE(Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe)
mediator Franz Vranitzky said on Friday there was no alternative
to foreign intervention to halt Albania's descent into chaos.
</P>
<P>
Despite having to discuss Albania, the EU ministers were keen
to get the issue behind them so they could address on Sunday some
long-term EU issues on the planned agenda, such as enlargement and
the relationship with NATO enlargement plans.

Four directors of Toronto-based Sherritt International Corp.

Last July, the U.S. issued similar letters to seven Sherritt
executives on grounds that they were violating the Helms-Burton
law, which seeks to punish companies doing business in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Sherritt operates a nickle company in Cuba and is expanding
into other sectors in the Caribbean island country.
</P>
<P>
Eggleton said that Canada will join the European Union (EU)
case at the World Trade Organization and provide testimony about
the "chilling effect" of Helms-Burton on trade with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Canada may take its own complaint against Helms-Burton to a
North American Free Trade Agreement panel depending upon the
progress of the EU case, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. has no business trying to foist its laws on other
countries. If it wants to deal with Cuba, it should deal with Cuba
directly and not try to punish companies in Canada and other
countries through its law," he added.

<HEADLINE> Zairean Rebels Enter Kisangani to Meet Full </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The first group of victorious
rebels entered Zaire's strategic city of Kisangani this afternoon
and were received with full embrace by jubilant local inhabitants,
reported the Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
When trucks transporting rebels circulated in the center of the
city by 14:00 GMT, there was no gunfire heard but only cries of
happiness and salutation from local inhabitants long expecting the
arrival of the soldiers of Laurent-Desire Kabila, AFP quoted a
witness -- who wished to remain anonymous -- as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean government troops looted food warehouses and shops
of the city this morning and virtually gave no fight when they
fled, according to reports from Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted a spokesman of the rebels as saying in Goma today
that fighting was continuing in Kisangani and that the rebels have
taken the international airport, which is 17 kilometers from the
third biggest city of Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The French army evacuated about 15 Westerners, including French
diplomats, two journalists of AFP and several officials of
international humanitarian organizations, from Kisangani this
morning on a military aircraft to Central African Republic's
capital Bangui.

<HEADLINE> Major Unveils Tory Election Campaign Slogan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
unveiled the Conservative Party's election slogan on Saturday,
insisting "you can only be sure with the Conservatives".
</P>
<P>
This is intended to underline the theme that the Tories
represent stability, while electing a Labor government would be a
leap in the dark.
</P>
<P>
Major told a meeting of Conservative Central Council in Bath,
southwest England, that "we'll win because our policies work and
Labour's don't, because we say what we believe in and Labour
don't, because we're proud of our record and they're trying to
hide their past."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister vowed to turn the poor and needy "have-nots"
into the "haves" and promised to enable the have-nots to share the
country's economic success.
</P>
<P>
But he warned party supporters that they were up against the
argument that it was time for a change.
</P>
<P>
Major is widely expected to call an election for May 1, and a
formal declaration of the election day is expected next week,
giving six weeks of campaigning compared with the normal four.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Bankruptcies Up 20 Percent in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Business and personal bankruptcies
in Canada soared to a record in 1996, up 20 percent than in 1995,
the previous record year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from Industry Canada show 79,631 consumers and
14,229 businesses went bankrupt across Canada in 1996, up 23
percent and 7.5 percent respectively over 1995.
</P>
<P>
A sluggish economy and consumers' easy access to credit are
being blamed here for the rapid bankruptcy increases.
</P>
<P>
To Aron Gampel, Bank of Nova Scotia economist, Canada's
plodding economic recovery is the root of cause of the
bankruptcies.
</P>
<P>
"Slow growth in the economy is not conducive to lowering the
bankruptcy rate," Aron Gampel was quoted as saying by reports
today.
</P>
<P>
"The bankruptcy numbers have tended to rise over the past 12 to
24 months because of the sluggishness in the Canadian economy," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The rise in consumer failures is in part due to the spread of
credit-card use, according to Sherry Cooper, chief economist at
investment dealer Nesbitt Burns.
</P>
<P>
"Banks have blanketed low-income areas with credit cards and
people over-extended themselves," she said, adding "credit is
readily available and that kind of credit is extremely expensive."
</P>
<P>
Latest figures show that Canadians had outstanding credit-card
balances in October 1996 of 13.7 billion U.S. dollars, up from
12.8 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
People may not see much improvement in the country's overall
bankruptcy picture over the next few years even if the economy
grows at a healthy rate, analysts here said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 15 (Xinhua)-- This year's first 400 Somali
pilgrims have left their country for Saudi Arabia by air in
the past two days.
</P>
<P>
The pilgrims are from Mogadishu, Bossaso, Berbera and
Hargeisa.
</P>
<P>
Amir Lsse Aidid, the Chairman of Africa Airlines, said his
airlines has planned 10 flights to Jeddah for transporting
1,500 pilgrims this year.
</P>
<P>
The pilgrims are required to take 820 U.S. Dollars with them
to buy non-refundable two-way tickets to Saudi Arabia and for
other use there.
</P>
<P>
Only pilgrims holding cholera and yellow fever vaccinations
certificates can be allowed to fly to Jeddah.
</P>
<P>
The three local air agencies -- Africa, Dallo and Kilimanjaro
Air -- are expected to transport more than 7,500 Somali pilgrims
to Saudi Arabia this year.
</P>
<P>
Air agencies from Kenya and Djibouti, both bordering on
Somalia, provide visa facilitation for pilgrims, resulting in the
increase of pilgrims this year.
</P>
<P>
The flights to Jeddah will stop by early next month, according
to instructions by Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The Hadj will take place after more than 30 days in the holy
town of Mecca.
</P>
<P>
The pilgrims will be provided with Somalia's blue flags with
the white star at the center, so that they can find each other
more easier in Mecca. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Maguid,
secretary general of the League of Arab States, today condemned
the killing of seven Israeli schoolgirls by a Jordanian soldier,
and described it an "obstacle" to the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said that he regretted for the occurrence of this incident
"no matter whether it was targeted at Arabs or non-Arabs."
</P>
<P>
The Arab League's secretary general denounced this kind of
operations which "obstruct the peace process in the region which,
anyway, has actually been obstructed."
</P>
<P>
He believed that the peace process would "still be suspended
by this kind of things."
</P>
<P>
Six other children were also wounded when the Jordanian
soldier fired an automatic rifle at an Israeli bus running along
the Jordan River Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Maguid left Beirut this evening for Cairo, winding up a
three-day visit to Lebanon during which he held meetings with the
Lebanese leaders and took part in activities marking the 19th
anniversary of the Israeli occupation in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters at the Beirut International Airport, the
secretary general reiterated his support for Lebanon, noting that
the Israeli occupation in south Lebanon must be terminated and
the resistance was an "honor of the Arab nation."
</P>
<P>
Rallies and other activities were held in Lebanon Thursday
and Friday to mark the first Israeli invasion into Lebanon on
March 14, 1978, which constituted the start of Israel's
occupation of some one tenth of Lebanon's territories.

ATHENS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos said today that Greece will participate in an OSCE
(the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe)
international police force for Albania if the organization's
council accepts the proposal submitted by former Austrian
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky.
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos made the statement in reply to journalists'
questions after a seminar on technology in northern Greek town of
Salonika.
</P>
<P>
He said that with its participation in such a force, "Greece
will fulfill the obligation it has as Albania's neighbour for the
safeguarding of that country's smooth progression."
</P>
<P>
He added however that an intervention of this kind would not be
enough. There should also be a European Union initiative to
support Albania economically, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Greece will submit a specific proposal in this direction, both
to the EU and to international organizations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Greece has been pushing for a peaceful solution to the Albanian
crisis so as to prevent a mass exodus of refugees across the
border and also to ensure that the large ethnic Greek minority
living in southern Albania enjoys security.

Commissioner for Refugees.

However, the head said despite the encouraging trend, the

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The radio of the Zairean rebels,
"Voice of People", announced this evening the capture of the
strategic city of Kisangani by its troops "after five hours of
cut-throat fighting".
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted the radio as saying that
the fighting took place between "the Army of Liberation of the
Congo" and Zairean government troops, the FAZ, who were supported
by former Rwandan Hutu soldiers and Rwanda's extremist Hutu
"Interahamwes" militias.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Kisangani international airport was under the
control of the rebels since 11:00 (10:00 GMT) this morning.
</P>
<P>
It said that the local inhabitants have fled the city in fear
of "lootings and criminal acts" of the defeated government forces,
while the mercenaries hired by the Zairean government fled on
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Kisangani is the third largest city of Zaire and capital of the
Upper Zaire region. Its fall has removed the last block to the
advance of the rebels east of the Zaire River.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have so far taken one fifth of the Zairean
territory.

CAIRO, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs

</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan is the largest per capita recipient of
Japanese aid in the world, Jordan's news agency Petra
today quoted Japanese ambassador Takayuki Kimura as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, Jordan received 40 percent of the net
aid inflow into the Middle East from Japan, the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is also the biggest recipient of the non-project grant
from Japan among the Middle East countries, Kimura said, adding
that Jordan is accepting other kind of aid, such as project
grants, project loans and technical assistance from Japan.
</P>
<P>
He said Japan appreciates and supports Jordan's policies toward
the Middle East peace and its efforts toward self-sustainable
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti
signed the latest agreement to accept some 21 million U.S. dollars
grant from Japan.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS), one of the world
top banks, showed confidence in Jordan's economy by identifying
eight Jordanian companies as potential firms for foreign
investments, Jordan's news agency Petra reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The UBS will hold a conference in London on May 15 in an effort
to promote the eight companies among 60 of UBS clients.
</P>
<P>
The eight state-holding companies, in which the government
holds large stakes, are from the industries of phosphate, potash,
cement, electricity and telecommunications as well as the bank and
investment sector, said Amman Financial Market (AFM) Director
General Wahib Shair.
</P>
<P>
A UBS delegation arrived in Amman last Wednesday for a two-day
visit to prepare for the conference, said Shair, adding that the
delegation also met with several Jordanian ministers and officials.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in 1993, Jordan missed many investment
opportunities as foreign investors were required to obtain a prior
approval for investment from the Prime Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"But, with changes in the law brought about by the (Cairo)
Middle East and North Africa economic summit (last November), the
need for prior approval from the Prime Ministry was canceled," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Shair stressed the importance of reversing "the traditional
way" of attracting foreign investments, to a new approach
of "meeting investors, showing them we are interested, listening
to their views and communicating their ideas to the government."
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- Kuwait will impose a 100 percent custom tariffs

</P>
<P>
Kuwait currently imposes 50 percent of custom tariffs on

<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- A five-day bi-annual conference of the
Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) on oil
exploration, prosecution, refining and petro-chemical industries

</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, OAPEC Secretary-General
Abdel Aziz Al-Turki said the oil industry of the OAPEC has
realized marked progress in the fields of exploration,
industrialization, transport and marketing, overcoming many
difficulties and problems.
</P>
<P>
He told 40 oil officials and experts from various Arab
oil producing countries that the oil industry was undergoing
tremendous technological developments in exploration, prospecting,
and other fields such as refining, transport, storage and
marketing.
</P>
<P>
The OAPEC has a collective total proven oil reserve of 636.2
billion barrels, amounting to 60.84 percent of the total world
oil reserve of 1045.7 billion barrels.
</P>
<P>
Recent studies indicated that world oil consumption last year

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
today said that a summit on the crisis in the Great Lakes
region would be held here on March 19.
</P>
<P>
Moi believed that Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko or his
representative would come to attend the Nairobi Summit III to be
held after the March 19 meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan president was speaking at a public rally in Baringo
District, northwest Kenya.
</P>
<P>
He noted that after foreign ministers of South Africa,
Zimbabwe, Cameroun and Kenya visited Kinshasa to consult Zairean
officials, he called for another meeting for the four heads of
state on March 12.
</P>
<P>
However, the March 12 meeting could not materialize because
President Nelson Mandela was touring the Far East and suggested
that March 19 would be convenient to him.
</P>
<P>
President Moi pointed out that the presidents of South Africa,
Zimbabwe, Cameroun and Kenya were mandated at the Nairobi Summit
II to find a lasting solution to the crisis in eastern Zaire and
the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
It was reported in Cape Town on Friday that President Mandela
would not attend the Nairobi Summit on the Zairean crisis to be
held next week and he would send an unnamed representative to
attend the two-day meeting in the Kenyan capital.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan president decried conflicts on the African
continent, adding that colonial boundaries should be respected in
order to ease some of the conflicts.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that expansionist or cessionist moves only
escalated the conflicts.
</P>
<P>
President Moi once again asked human rights bodies to direct
their efforts towards these conflict-prone areas instead of
talking about violations in other places.

PARIS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Algeria's security forces blocked
this afternoon all accessed to the old city of Algiers, Cashah,
where the militant group of Armed Islamic Group (GIA) is
reportedly active, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Police have blocked roads leading to Cashah, which is located
in the center of Algiers, while soldiers were patrolling the
outskirt of the town, but no gun fires were heard this afternoon,
said the reports.
</P>
<P>
Cashah, which has 1,700 inhabitants, is one of the strongholds
of the GIA which imposes its law on the local inhabitants and
whose members were seen walking around the narrow streets of the
town with weapons.
</P>
<P>
Several assassinations have recently taken place in Cashah and
the residents of other parts of Algiers dare not enter the area.
</P>
<P>
Three days ago, Algerian security forces killed 12 GIA members
in an anti-terrorist operation in another district of Algiers,
Beau Fraisier.
</P>
<P>
For more than one month, Algerian security forces have been
carrying out a large-scale operation against the GIA across the
country.
</P>
<P>
Algeria will hold its general elections on June 5 to put into
place a new two-chamber parliament.

MAPUTO, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican customs officers have
detained three trucks of a South African company, Vaal Maseru,
accusing the firm of goods smuggling, the Mozambican Information
Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
All the goods on the trucks, including colored television
sets, conditioners, refrigerators, sofas and garments, were
confiscated at the Ressano Garcia checkpoint on the
Mozambican-South African border.
</P>
<P>
The owners of the trucks once showed certificates proving that
the goods belong to Mozambican miners working in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, the certificates were forged," said a Mozambican
policeman who did not reveal his name.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Mozambican customs officers will continue to
check trucks and goods through the border.
</P>
<P>
Some transportation firms and individuals are still trying to
smuggle goods into Mozambique to dodge tariffs, he said.
</P>
<P>
The last truck detention took place on March 3.
</P>
<P>
Following the tightened check at the Ressano Garcia checkpoint
by Mozambique, goods carried into the southern African country
have reduced sharply, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
The South African police have taken the corresponding
measures, said the reports.

<HEADLINE> Hussein to Visit Families of Shooting Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 15 (Xinhua) -- King of Jordan Hussein is
scheduled to be in Israel Sunday to visit the family members of
the victims of the shooting incident that happened Thursday,
Jordan Television Channel Two reported today.
</P>
<P>
The king, cutting short his visit to Spain and coming back to
Amman Thursday, has expressed condolence to Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu through a telephone call.
</P>
<P>
A Jordanian soldier Thursday opened fire at a group of Israeli
school girls who were on school outing in the Naharayim area on
the Jordanian side of the border, killing seven girls and
wounding six others.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old murderer, Ahmad Mousa Dakamseh, has been
arrested.
</P>
<P>
The king, who is scheduled to visit Washington on March 18,
has rescheduled his visit there.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan said Friday that the attack was
an isolated incident and did not reflect Jordan's policy or
conduct of its armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The attack happened when the Israeli government pushes on its
Jewish settlement policy in Arab's East Jerusalem despite
international opposition and Jordan's efforts to prevent Israel
from doing so become futile over and over again.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Gaza Meeting Aims to Save Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat told foreign diplomats today that "I called this meeting
for one purpose, that is, to save the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Addressing an international conference at the Shawa Center in
Gaza, Arafat called for international help to extricate the
regional peace process from a deep crisis stemming from the
Israeli government decision to build a new Jewish settlement in
the Arab East Jerusalem, according to a report of JMCC, a
Palestinian press service based in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The participants included Egyptian Deputy Foreign Minister
Bader Hamam, Jordanian Ambassador to the Arab League Nayef
Al-Qadi, Norwegian Ambassador Muna Yol as well as diplomats of the
United States, Russia, Japan, the European Union and the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is very dangerous," Arafat said. "The settlement
activities in Jerusalem and its surrounding areas ... and other
parts of the Palestinian territories ... constitute a plan
targeting to destroy the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Arafat noted that settlement activities and land confiscation
are continuing on an unprecedented scale not only in East
Jerusalem but in Hebron and even in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
"We strive to protect the peace process ... but the signed
agreements should be respected," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader called for a collective responsibility
to find a mechanism to confront (Israeli) non-commitment to the
signed agreements. He added that "non-commitment means that we
have been left without a partner in the peace process. We need
your assistance in bringing about an honest implementation (of
the agreements) and finding a mechanism to guarantee that
unilateral decisions are not taken."
</P>
<P>
"I call on you to work together in this conference in order to
protect the peace process from harms caused by building
settlement, creating facts on the ground, showing arrogance and
dictating decisions," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat declared: "We would like to reaffirm our total
commitment to the peace process and the signed agreements. At the
same time I call upon the Israeli government to be a true partner
and not to take unilateral decisions that threaten the peace
process."
</P>
<P>
"Peace and settlement do not meet. Terrorism, settlement, land
confiscation, acts of imposing facts on the ground should all be
the language of the past as the language of the future is
security, stability and justice," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I call on the Israeli government to retract its settlement
decisions to give the the peace process the opportunity it
deserves," stated Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Arafat took the opportunity to reiterate the ultimate
Palestinian goal to establish an independent Palestinian state
with Jerusalem as its capital, alongside the state of
Israel.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Inject More Resources into Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has planned to
inject more resources into tourism to attract more tourists,
Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa said today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when opening the 52-room Serena Inn owned
by the Aga Khan, the Shia Ismaili spiritual leader, at the heart
of Stone Town in Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said the government, with the help of donors, will
strive to inject more resources into tourism supportive services,
infrastructure and advertising.
</P>
<P>
"We plan to do so in the belief that even as the tourism
sector is usually a private sector affairs, to succeed it
requires public sector support on infrastructure, including good
airports, transport and communication networks," he said.
</P>
<P>
He told the Aga Khan that Tanzania is reviewing the tax
profile of the industry so as to make the country a "truly
competitive destination for private investment, especially
foreign direct investment".
</P>
<P>
As many as 39 million US Dollars of investment follows the
opening of three other tourist lodges in the northern tourist
circuit and a luxury tented camp in the Tanzania Mainland.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa commended the Aga Khan for his keen interest in
developing the tourism sector in the eastern African country,
adding that his investment in the field has promoted quality
tourism.
</P>
<P>
He told the Aga Khan that tourism is the largest foreign
exchange earner for Tanzania and provides about 30,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourists has remarkably increased in Tanzania,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The number has jumped from 64,000 in 1984 to 326,194 last year
and revenues from the sector have shot up from 9.4 million Dollars
in 1984 to 322 million Dollars last year," said.
</P>
<P>
"Our target, which we consider quite achievable, is to receive
500,000 tourists by the year 2000, earn 585 million Dollars a
year and create 45,000 jobs," the president said.
</P>
<P>
He told the Aga Khan that with partners like Serena Inn, with the
wide array of tourist attractions and with correct government
policies, Tanzania could certainly be competitive.
</P>
<P>
The Aga Khan arrived in the country on Thursday for an
official visit. enditem

<HEADLINE> French Jews Ask for Transparency over Pre-war </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- France's major Jewish group, the
Representative Council of Jews of France (CRIF), today called on
the government and the Bank of France to give transparency to an
estimated 1 billion franc (200 million U.S. dollar) pre-war bank
deposits of French Jews who died in Nazi death camps.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the daily Le Monde published today,
the Bank of France has lost trail of the individual accounts of
Jews who were deported to Nazi death camps by the Vichy
collaboration regime during World War II.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the value of these accounts, which were in
default of heirs, could amount to more than 1 billion francs in
its present value, in accordance with a study made in 1951 by a
government group on the archives of Vichy police department in
charge of Jewish questions.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for French banks to be accused of hiding
Jewish accounts which were not claimed because of the Nazi
Holocaust during the war, although the Paris municipality was
accused last year of maintaining Jewish real estate properties
confiscated by the Vichy regime.
</P>
<P>
"The French banks have neither tried in their whole to make
known the reality of these accounts, nor attempted to find their
heirs, and have not made the least gesture to help the Jewish
orphans whose parents were exterminated (by Nazis)," said CRIF.
</P>
<P>
The CRIF also asked for the revelation of the whereabouts of
the deposits of Jewish families whose members were all killed, as
well as the life insurance contracts signed between these Jews and
French banks.
</P>
<P>
It said that "all the necessary investigations should be made
by the working group" to be set up within two weeks by the French
government on Jewish properties robbed by Nazis and the Vichy
regime.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Alain Juppe announced in January that he
would set up a working group to investigate the whereabouts of
Jewish properties lost during the war.
</P>
<P>
The French laws require the banks to submit to the state all
accounts which are not claimed 30 years after they are deposited.

<HEADLINE> UK Jobless Total at 4 Million, Labor Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The real number of people out of
work in Britain stood at more than four million, said the main
opposition Labor Party's employment spokesman Peter Hain Friday.
</P>
<P>
Using the most recent official Labor Force Survey, Hain said
that 4,401,000 people were looking for work at the end of last
summer, more than double the official count then of 2,043,000.
</P>
<P>
Labor's figures, which were based on the government's claimant
count plus the number of people looking for work but unable to
claim the Job Seeker's Allowance and those on compulsory
government schemes, are in line with estimates made by the Trade
Union Congress and the independent Unemployment Unit (UU).
</P>
<P>
The UU put the current underlying unemployment rate at 17
percent compared to the official rate of 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Hain said that the fall in the official dole figures is
increasingly accounted for by the gap between those allowed to
claim unemployment benefit and those actually unemployed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the UU estimated that more than half of the drop in
the claimant count since last October, 137,000 out of 255,000, had
been due to the Jobseeker's Allowance which tightens benefit
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
Hain said that a Labor government would conduct a review to
introduce a "politically impartial measure" of unemployment.

<HEADLINE> Liberia's Kromah Pardoned by Peacekeepers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping
force known as ECOMOG has pardoned Liberia's presidential
candidate and ex-warlord Alhaji Kromah found of hiding a large
quantity of arms in his home, a report reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
The report said this was announced by ECOMOG Commander
Major-General Victor Malu in Monrovia on Friday, a few hours
after Kromah tendered his unreserved apology.
</P>
<P>
The peacekeeping force has earlier in two separate raids found
a large quantity of arms in Kromah's home in Liberia's capital
Monrovia and in his country home some 260 kilometers north of the
capital.
</P>
<P>
He was first put under house arrest by the ECOMOG and then
transferred to the local police. An earlier report said he was
expected to be prosecuted this week.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG has required the Liberian interim authorities to
drop the charges being prepared against Kromah, the leader of the
United Liberation Movement of Liberia -- one of the key warring
factions during the seven-year Liberian civil war.
</P>
<P>
Malu said the ECOMOG's clemency was "dictated purely by our
desire to ensure that the peace process remains on course".
</P>
<P>
It is a recognition of the fact that "Kromah is a key player
in present day Liberia," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was also taken into consideration that Kromah voluntarily
started disarmament of his faction in Voinjama in September 1996,
two months ahead of the concerned official commencement, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG high command also made a request for the release of
all those so far found with arms and already handed over to the
Liberian authorities for prosecution, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Malu, however, warned that the plea by the ECOMOG "should not
be construed as license" for those still in possession of arms.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG would not relent in its efforts to rid Liberia out
of arms, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Kromah said in his apology issued at a press conference in his
home that "I wish to admit to my error for having arms at my
premises after the January 31, 1997, the deadline for disarmament,"
according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Kromah was quoted as saying he has "no motive, no desire, no plan"
to engage himself in any activity to undermine or disrupt the
peace process, security and current happiness of Liberians.

APELDOORN, Netherlands, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Dutch Foreign

had received reports that Albanian President Sali Berisha had

resigned," van Mierlo told a news conference, after EU foreign
ministers ended the first day of their two-day informal meeting in

which holds currently the OSCE(Organization for Security and
Co-operation in Europe) presidency, called for Berisha to step

But German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel distanced himself from
the idea. "If there is to be a political solution, the president
will have to consider when and how he can contribute to a
solution," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Since the reports on Berisha's resignation is not yet
confirmed, the ministers will continue their discussion on Sunday

</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the EU nations is deeply divided on
whether to provide military assistance to Albania, the ministers
have agreed to establish a limited military or police presence
with the task of providing protection for a civilian assistance
mission to Albania.
</P>

humanitarian assistance as soon as conditions are sufficiently
secure to assure its delivery," a statement from the Dutch

<HEADLINE> France: Turkey Has Right for EU Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
APELDOORN, March 16 (Xinhua) -- France said today that the
European Union (EU) should make it clear to Ankara that Turkey has
the right for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey has the right to join EU and that right has to be
confirmed forcefully," France's Foreign Minister Herve de Charette
told reporters at an informal EU foreign ministers meeting in the
Dutch town of Apeldoorn.
</P>
<P>
The French minister distanced his country sharply from a number
of EU countries whose leaders have ruled out Turkey's EU
membership.
</P>
<P>
De Charette said Turkey's accession to the EU was important for
the stability in the region, adding "We can only judge the
membership of a country on objective criteria, and certainly not
on religious or ethnic criteria."
</P>
<P>
He said France would like to include Turkey in a so-called
Permanent European Conference, a forum designed to get the EU
membership aspirants better prepared for the accession.
</P>
<P>
On March 4, a summit of the European People's Party made up of
parities from eight European countries, concluded in Brussels that
Turkey's EU membership was not acceptable at present.
</P>
<P>
Among the attendants of the summit were German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, Spanish Prime Minister Jose-Maria Aznar and Italian
Prime Minister Romano Prodi.

<HEADLINE> China's New Criminal Law Expected To Improve Securities Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese financial experts and
officials today praised the country's new criminal law, and said
that the inclusion of crimes in the securities business, the first
time for China to do so, will help make for a healthier securities
market.
</P>
<P>
"The new clauses on securities crimes will help prevent crime
and will provide powerful legal support for the healthy and steady
development of the securities market in China," Wang Guogang,
deputy director of the financial research center of the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences, told Xinhua by phone. "The market
impact of the new clauses will be far-reaching," he said.
</P>
<P>
The amended Criminal Law was approved on Friday by the National
People's Congress, China's legislature. Sentences for those who
violate securities rules by providing inside information,
spreading false information, or manipulating securities prices can
be up to ten years in prison.
</P>
<P>
The new law, which takes effect October 1, will provide the
authorities with a more powerful and effective legal tool to deal
with violations, Wang said, pointing out that "The amendments to
the law reflect the hard facts of some fairly serious violations
of securities market rules."
</P>
<P>
After more than five years of development, China's securities
market is well on its way toward accelerated expansion. The stock
market has 564 companies listed, compared with 530 at the end of
last year, with total share value exceeding 129.2 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has maintained a policy of securities
market standardization and has done everything possible to
establish a legal framework for the market, an official with the
China Securities Regulatory Commission, the industry watchdog,
noted, "But the existing market regulations have proven inadequate
for an accelerated market expansion."
</P>
<P>
He explained that market irregularities have increased
securities investment risks, damaged investor confidence, and even
posed a threat to the long-term development of the securities
market.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Bingxun, director of the market development department of
the China Securities Executive Council, pointed out that harsh
legal penalties are necessary to curb securities-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
"Crimes in the securities industry usually involve a huge
amount of money, so for the benefit of a healthy and orderly
securities market we need a strong legal weapon to deal with
them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Guogang noted that a market economy is one governed by the
law and by market rules, and that the securities market, as a part
of it, can develop healthily only when there is a sound legal
framework to build on.
</P>
<P>
"When one takes the long view and looks at it against a broader
economic backdrop, improving the legal basis of the securities
market becomes even more significant," Wang said.

<HEADLINE> Bridge Linking Shenzhen, Hong Kong Passes Experts Appraisal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, March 16 (Xinhua) -- A meeting in Snenzhen, in south
China's Guangdong Province, to discuss construction of a highway
bridge between this booming city and neighboring Hong kong ended
today.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 experts at the conference said that the significance of
another highway in the western part of Shenzhen would be in
maintaining the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and for
developing the economy of the Pearl River Delta and the whole of
south China.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was organized by the China International
Engineering Consulting Corporation on behalf of China's State
Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
After field studies in Shenzhen and Hong Kong were done and a
feasibility study completed, experts pointed out that the existing
three ports between the two cities can hardly meet development
demands.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, a five-km-long highway bridge will be
built across the sea, linking Dongjiaotou in Shekou and Yuen Long
in Hong Kong. A 50-ha port area will also be built. Many Hong Kong
consortiums have showed an interest in the project, sources say.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Woman Sets Race Record at HK Golden Mile Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 16 (Xinhua) -- China's Zhang Jinqing set a new
race record of four minutes 37 seconds to win the women's event at
the annual Hong Kong International Golden Mile Race Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The winning time of 20-year-old Zhang from North China's Hebei
Province beat the six-year-old race record of 4:41 held by British
Karen Hutcheson.
</P>
<P>
Britain's defending champion Shirley Griffiths led most of the
race but was overtaken by Zhang some 200 meters from the finish
line. Griffiths was timed two hundredths of a second slower than
the Chinese winner.
</P>
<P>
Liu Haiyan, 22, from South China's Guangdong Province finished
third in 4:46 and her teammate Zeng Yuying, 23, was fifth in
4:51. This was Zeng's fourth appearance in the race, having
finished runner-up last year and in 1994 and third in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy to beat the record," said a smiling Zhang after the
awarding ceremony. "The course is nice and the weather was good
today, not so warm as I had expected."
</P>
<P>
Zhang said she just ran as she had planned -- following the
leader for most of the distance and overtaking the lead in the
later stage.
</P>
<P>
"Although we two were evenly matched, I knew things were
determined when I overtook her (Griffiths)," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I did what I could. But Zhang really ran faster than I could
today. What else can I say? " said a disappointed Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
But she said she would try to compete here again next
year. That would be her fourth time here for the 24-year-old from
Newcastle.
</P>
<P>
John Henwood from New Zealand won the men's title in 4:08.
</P>
<P>
Henwood, with a personal best time for mile of 3:59, edged
Chinese Hou Gang by one hundredth of a second. But the New
Zealander failed to beat the race mark of 4:05, held since 1995 by
Briton Anthony Whiteman.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Darren Spawforth finished third in 4:11 and another
Chinese Zhu Yueqiang was seventh in 4:28.
</P>
<P>
"It's really a good win, with so many spectators cheering on
for you," said Henwood after his win.
</P>
<P>
"It's a bit windy today. But the weather is good, not so hot
as back in New Zealand, and the course is good," he said.

<HEADLINE> Agro-Science Helps Northeast China Improve Harvests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province attribute successively good harvests to
scientific farming methods that have now become standard in rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
The province is one of China's major grain producers and had a
record grain output of 30.465 billion kilograms in 1996, an
increase of 4.55 billion kilograms over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Ma Ting'ai, a young farmer in Fujin City, planted three ha of
rice and bred 50,000 fish in the paddy by closely following what
he had learned at a training class. His return amounted to 30,000
yuan.
</P>
<P>
At first, farmers didn't understand this when a pilot project
in farm standardization started in 10 counties in 1984. But
gradually more farmers like Ma helped popularize practices in
rural parts of the province in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
It took 34 years for the province to produce 15 billion
kilograms of grain after the founding of New China in 1949, but
only 13 more years to double that output, according to provincial
officials. Science and technology are said to have contributed 42
percent of that unprecedented growth.
</P>
<P>
The growing season in Yi'an County is only 120 to 125 days
long. Corn output per ha there was 1,995 kilograms in 1989. Then
agronomists introduced new rice strains and the use of plastic
sheeting while doubling the number of seedlings per hectare. By
1996 the county had a per ha corn output of 7,590 kg.
</P>
<P>
Agronomists are sent during the busy season to help ensure the
use of standardized farming methods. The province has held 25,000
training classes, benefitting more than two million farmers, and
adopted 810 scientific standards and helped supervise the whole
process of farming.
</P>
<P>
Standardized farming was used on 3.162 million ha in 1996,
accounting for 60.55 percent of the province's total crop area.
That coverage is expected to be expanded.

<HEADLINE> East Chinese Province Opening Wider to Outside World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province has
plans to open wider to the outside world, with priority to be
given to the export-oriented economy and use of overseas
investment.
</P>
<P>
The province will give foreign trade licenses to a greater
number of enterprises, use agents for foreign trade, and help
build a number of profitable foreign trade firms into groups or
multinational enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Emphasis will also be placed on development zones and
foreign-funded enterprises, which are expected to give an impetus
to local economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The province intends to open two more counties and one or two
more ports to foreigners and to add group charter air routes for
tourists linking the provincial capital of Hefei and a local
scenic spot at Huangshan with foreign countries, such as Japan and
the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
It also plans to participate in activities in other provinces
or abroad, including a TV Week in Europe, investment talks in Hong
Kong, and a commodity fair in the city of Xi'an in north China, in
a bid to make Anhui better known outside China and to increase
economic cooperation with other provinces and with foreign
countries.

<HEADLINE> North China Port City To Develop New Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, March 16 (Xinhua) -- A total of 60 infrastructure
projects estimated to cost 3.2 billion yuan are scheduled to be
built this year in the Binhai New Area of Tianjin, which includes
the Tianjin Development Zone, Tianjin Free Trade Zone, and a
harbor area.
</P>
<P>
This is north China's largest port city. Construction work on
the new area began three years ago as part of its 21st century
development strategy. So far, more than six billion yuan have been
spent on more than 120 infrastructure projects in the area.
</P>
<P>
The large expenditure is to be used for highways, power
stations, expansion of Binhai airport, and a sewage and drainage
project, and is expected to help the area increase the amount of
overseas funds by improving its investment environment.
</P>
<P>
Large-scale industries have also been set up in the new area,
covering the fields of electronics, foodstuff, metallurgy, and
petrochemicals.
</P>
<P>
The area now has a group of enterprises each with more than 100
million or one billion US dollars invested. The area added more
than 600 foreign-funded enterprises last year, with contracted
overseas funds of more than 1.87 billion dollars. Investors from
other parts of China have also been providing funds for the area.
</P>
<P>
The area generated more than 32 billion yuan in GDP last year,
a 28.3 percent rise from the previous year, and nearly double the
growth rate for the entire city. The area contributes nearly 30
percent of the city's economic growth now.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin's goal this year is to pull in 2.3 billion dollars of
overseas investment, which will mean a 15 percent increase over
1996. In order to increase the use of overseas investment, the
city will try to get local companies to be listed abroad on stock
exchanges.

<HEADLINE> Kinkel Says Germany Has Taken in Enough Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 16 (Xinhua) -- In anticipation of a refugee exodus
from Albania, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has said that
his country has taken in too many foreign refugees and can accept
no further major inflows.
</P>
<P>
"Under current circumstances we can no longer take in any
significant number of refugees. Our boat is full," Kinkel was
quoted today by the German Sunday newspaper Welt am Sonntag as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel noted that Germany, in comparison to other European
countries, has accepted much more refugees.
</P>
<P>
Some 320,000 refugees from Bosnia and 120,000 asylum-seekers,
overwhelmingly ethnic Albanians from the Yugoslavian autonomous
province of Kosovo, are currently living in Germany.
</P>
<P>
But the German foreign minister also asserted that Germany does
not want to be "inhumane" and does not reject in principle the
acceptance of refugees.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Albanians have fled the civil unrest sweeping
across the Balkan country since January after pyramid investment
schemes collapsed, costing the life savings of many Albanians.

<HEADLINE> Defending Champion Wanda Wins Opener of 1997 Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Dalian Wanda
took a steady step toward its third title in four years Sunday by
beating Vanguard Huandao 2-0 in the first match of the 1997 season
of Chinese soccer first-division league Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Wanda, which won the league in 1994 and 1996, extended its
unbeaten record to 35 matches after the Sunday's victory.
</P>
<P>
Wanda went ahead in the 34th minute when Wang Peng found the
net with a lob, which flew straight into the goal over the keeper
of Huandao.
</P>
<P>
Xu Hui made it 2-0 in the 54th minute in a quick counter-attack.
</P>
<P>
Huandao, who was promoted from the second division after taking
the top place last season, almost scored for several times but
failed to convert the chances into goals.
</P>
<P>
Under the coach of German Klaus Schlappner, former head coach
of the Chinese national squad, Huandao moved from Wuhan of Hubei
Province to the soccer-crazy city, which was just appoved by the
National People's Congress as the China's fourth municipality
after Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
But it was hard for Huandao to live up to the high expectations
by a boisterous crowd of 40,000 before a much stronger Wanda.
</P>
<P>
Schlappner, who earned a name of aggressiveness during his
coaching of the Chinese national team, admitted the result
reflected a gap between the two champions from the first and
second divisions.
</P>
<P>
Last season's runner-up Shanghai Shenhua proved too strong for
the visiting Yanbian Aodong when Shenhua scored a 2-0 win at home.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jun opened the scoring in the third minute after heading
home a cross from Fan Zhiyi, China's footballer of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Fan scored a penalty goal in the 57th minute after Aodong
committed a foul in the box, anchoring the win for Shenhua, who
won the league title in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, Guangzhou Apollo edged
Guangdong Hongyuan 1-0 in a rain-soaked match.
</P>
<P>
Tan Ende scored the sole goal for Apollo only five minutes into
action on a scramble in the box.
</P>
<P>
In the day's other matches, Chinese Soccer Association Cup
title-holder Beijing Guo'an was forced to a goalless draw by
Sichuan Quanxing, August First ousted Tianjin Lifei 1-0, and Jinan
Taishan suffered a surprise 0-1 loss to Qingdao Hainiu, the other
team promoted from the second division.

<HEADLINE> Saudi King Welcomes Iran's Invitation to Islamic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Saudi King Fahd has welcomed
Iran's invitation to him to attend an Islamic summit due in Tehran
in December, reports from the Saudi kingdom said today.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) said the visiting Iranian Foreign
Minister Ali Akbar Velayati conveyed the invitation from President
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani during a meeting with King Fahd late last
night.
</P>
<P>
Velayati, who who arrived in the Saudi capital of Riyadh
Saturday, told a press conference after meeting the Saudi King
that "King Fahd welcomed the invitation and said he would
participate as much as it would be possible for him," according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister is currently on a tour to
countries of the region to extend invitations to heads of states
and governments of Muslim countries for the 8th summit of the
Organization of Islamic Countries (OIC), the world's largest
Muslim body.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Velayati also held talks with the Saudi
Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal AL-Saud during which they
discussed such topics as security and bilateral trade exchange,
disputed islands with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the issue
of Jerusalem as well as the Gulf situation.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister was quoted by the KUNA as saying after the
talks they tackled a part of the issue such as trade cooperation
and the discussions would continue.
</P>
<P>
"Consolidating cooperation to ensure security is also an
Iranian demand, and the door is open," he said.
</P>
<P>
But concerning reports about an unannounced non-aggression
accord among Gulf states, he said "I am not aware where such an
accord or treaty had been prepared."
</P>
<P>
"Let me assure you that there is concurrence among us as to
arrangements for stability and arriving at security measures in
the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the disputed islands between Iran and the UAE,
he said that Iran "has always expressed readiness to start direct
talks with the UAE and there is a known accord signed by us and
the UAE," adding that the agreement, in which the British
Foreign Ministry was then a part, "should be the basis for any
talks between the two sides."
</P>
<P>
The disputed Islands in the Gulf have been held by Iran but
also claimed by the United Arab Emirates, resulting in the
strained relations between Iran and the Gulf Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The UAE is a close political and economic ally of Saudi Arabia
in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) which also groups Kuwait,
Oman, Bahrain and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is the second leg of Velayati's 10-nation tour
which first took him to Uganda and will also take him to other
Gulf Arab states, Turkey, Sudan and Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
Velayati had just completed a tour of Southeast Asia in a bid
to getting support for the summit meeting. An Iranian source
said recently that Saudi Arabia's presence would be "crucial"
because the Saudis "have the capacity to make or break the
conference."
</P>
<P>
Riyadh and Tehran, two of the world's biggest oil exporters,
are also at odds over the presence of U.S. and other Western
forces in the Gulf. Iran is critical of the West presence,
including about 5,000 U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, which Iran
says contributes to regional tension.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and its Gulf Arab allies have accused Iran of
interfering in their internal affairs, and voiced concern over
its arms build-up. But Iran denies the charges.
</P>
<P>
Velayati will leave Saudi Arabia for Muscat, Oman later
today.

<HEADLINE> IMF Praises Egypt's Economic Reform Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has expressed deep satisfaction with results achieved by the
economic reform program being implemented by the Egyptian
government, the Egyptian MENA news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Arvind Subramanian, IMF resident representative here, expected
that the volume of the foreign capital flow into Egypt this year
would reach 1.3 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He anticipated that the rate of annual economic growth in Egypt
would rise to 5 percent by the end of 1997 from 4 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The IMF official said Egypt has the potential to raise the
growth rate to 7 or 8 percent for raising standards of living and
reducing unemployment rates in a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
Inflation rate has dropped to 5.7 percent at the end of
January, while the budget deficit has dropped to 0.8 percent of
the Gross National Product(GNP), he said, describing this
percentage as very good with regard to economies of developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
According to previous IMF reports, inflation stood at 7 percent
while the budget deficit accounted for 1.5 percent of GNP last
December.
</P>
<P>
The IMF representative denied reports on differences between
the Egyptian government and the IMF as regards stepping up the
tempo of the country's privatization process.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt steadily proceeds in the privatization process according
to the program agreed upon with the Fund taking into consideration
social impact of the program," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of keeping the momentum of the
structural adjustment program specially in the coming period for
implementing further reforms in monetary and financial domain.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that permanent coordination and
consultation between the government and the Fund should continue
in order to implement the reform program without any side
effects.
</P>
<P>
The government pledged to expand privatization, further
liberalize foreign trade and reform financial system under
an agreement with the IMF on starting the second stage of the
Egyptian economic reform program in July 1993.

<HEADLINE> Rapid Growth in Shanghai's Foreign Trade (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest
economic center, reported a record 22.26 billion US dollars worth
of foreign trade last year, up 16.8 percent from that of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that Shanghai's exports increased 14.3
percent to 13.24 billion dollars worth in 1996. The growth in
foreign trade exceeded that for the city's GDP, which was 13
percent last year. Foreign trade accounted for 4.6 percent of the
GDP, up 1.3 percentage points from 1995.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that foreign trade will occupy an increasingly
important position in the city's economy, and that its development
will depend more and more on foreign trade in the future.
</P>
<P>
The city's import also reported a steady rise. According to
statistics, 943 million dollars worth of equipment was imported,
116 million dollars worth of timber, and 288 million dollars worth
of electrical household appliances last year, up 31.9 percent,
72.9 percent and 1,200 percent, respectively, from 1995.
</P>
<P>
"The more widely Shanghai opens to the outside, the more trade
partners and markets it has," said one analyst.
</P>
<P>
The city has had remarkable success in market expansion in
neighboring countries, and in Eastern Europe and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
It has established trade relations with 199 countries and
regions across the world, 16 more than in 1995, and the number of
trade partners that do more than five million dollars in trade
with the city climbed to 81 in 1996 from the previous year's 75.

<HEADLINE> Rapid Growth in Shanghai's Foreign Trade (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city's foreign-funded enterprises have also seen a rapid
increase in exports. The city approved 2,106 overseas investment
projects last year. The overall number of such projects is 15,692,
giving a great push to foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
These firms brought in 4 billion dollars from exports last
year, up 51.4 percent from 1995, and accounting for 30.3 percent
of the city's total export volume.
</P>
<P>
"The municipality has paid great attention to promoting exports
of its major products," said a municipal government official. It
has 60 products whose export volume exceeded 50 million dollars
each. Of these, 20 were worth more than 100 million dollars each.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the city's export structure is
improving, with exports of mechanical and electrical products
reaching 3.3 billion dollars in 1996, up 24.8 percent from the
previous year. The growth rate was the largest for the past few
years, analysts say, adding that exports of software technology
have also been growing.
</P>
<P>
"The city has attracted many foreign trade projects from
provinces along the Yangtze River Delta, along the coast and in
the country's central and western parts," the official
noted. Figures show that trade through Shanghai port was worth
more than 52 billion dollars last year, a record for the Chinese
ports.
</P>
<P>
The city's exports for the first two months of this year were
up more than 10 percent from the same period of last year,
according to the lastest official statistics. Although these signs
are encouraging, say some analysts, the city's foreign trade
situation is still somewhat unfavorable. Technology-intensive
products do not have a broad overseas market, for example,
export-tax refund rates have fallen, and protectionism in overseas
market is becoming increasingly serious.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government is hoping to maintain a growth rate in
foreign trade of 10 percent this year, an official says.

<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
demanded that any agreement signed between NATO and Russia should
be legally binding, a Finnish newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Finnish newspaper of Helsinki Sanomat,
Yeltsin said that NATO should make a clear commitment to guarantee
Russia's national security.
</P>
<P>
"The NATO expansion, if it becomes true, will radically reduce
our geo-political and geo-strategic position," Yeltsin said,
adding that this will oblige Russia to take "necessary"
countermeasures.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that the alliance's move to expand into Central
and Eastern European countries will reduce mutual trust between
Russia and Western countries and may create new confrontation.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, NATO declared in a statement that it will not
permanently station ground-combat troops on the territory of new
members.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin told the Finnish newspaper that the alliance's
commitments of neither deploying troops nor moving its military
infrastructure into the territory of the new members should be
written into the NATO-Russian agreement.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and U.S. President Bill Clinton are due to meet
Wednesday and Thursday here, focusing on the NATO expansion
issue.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and India have
averted a major diplomatic conflict folowing discloures that the
former has supplied Pakistan -- India's longtime arch foe -- with
missiles, local daily Sunday Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
A series of high-powered diplomatic exchanges between South
Africa and India have taken place since the missile sale was
reported last year in an effort to reduce growing tensions in
diplomatic relations between the two countries, the report said.
</P>
<P>
South African foreign affairs director general Rusty Evans was
quoted as saying that his government had spoken to India about
the missile sale in order to persuade that country that the
projectiles were defensive i nature.
</P>
<P>
Evans said the weapons supplied to Pakistan were air-to-air
missiles, which were incapable of being launched against Indian
ground forces in cross-border strike.
</P>
<P>
We gave them the assurance that we were sensitive to regional
issues and that we did not wish to upset the balance of power,
he said.
</P>
<P>
In December last year, South African deputy president Thabo
Mbeki visited India, concluding a formal defense agreement
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
South African president Nelson Mandela is set to go to India
in late March on a workin visit, during which agreements to
promote bilateral tourism and investment might be signed, local
press reported.
</P>
<P>
Evans confirmed that South Africa had begun supplying weapons
to India, but declined to give details of the projects. Informed
sources said that deals between Pretoria and New Dehli include
the refitting of Indian tanks with a sophisticated South African
turret and cannon.
</P>
<P>
Arms sales to India are believed to have exceeded those to
Pakistan in value with numerous other common or garden arms,
including ammunition and military vehicles, being supplied,
Sunday Times said.

the early '80s, have begun to leave the city to look for better
opportunities elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the number of migrant workers in this
economic zone on the edge of Hong Kong dropped to 1.74 million at
the end of 1996 from a high of 2.05 million in 1994, which was fed
by an annual increase of 200,000 over the past 10-odd years.
</P>
<P>
Xin Benlan, deputy director of the municipal labor bureau,
attributed the gradual decline mainly to some migrant workers'
inability to adapt to the city's speedy shift to
technology-intensive business.
</P>
<P>
Higher standards for workers were an inevitable development as
Shenzhen carried out its industrial readjustment and changed its
economic growth, the official said. Skilled and more talented
workers were badly needed during the transition from
labor-intensive enterprises to technology-intensive ones, Xin
explained.
</P>
<P>
The city's high-tech enterprises are said to be adding to their
personnel on a large scale this year, but the overwhelming
majority will be college students.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the drop is that more labor-intensive
enterprises, where most migrant workers are employed, are
themselves moving out of Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen adopted regulations in 1995 that required migrant
workers to pay a 300-yuan annual urban sanitation fee and tried to
impose some order on the disorderly migration process. The labor
bureau also keeps close contact with its counterparts in inland
provinces to try to put a limit on the number of workers. This
also restricts the influx.

<HEADLINE> More Southeast China Farmers Working Elsewhere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Because of the fast-growing
economy and improved agricultural productivity, more farmers in
east China's Fujian Province are looking for jobs in
non-agricultural sectors.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics indicate that some 3.91 million rural
laborers worked in non-agricultural sectors last year, an increase
of 200,000 over the previous year, and the fourth year in a row
that the figure has gone up, according to a local official.
</P>
<P>
In addition to looking for temporary jobs in urban areas,
farmer-workers are increasingly looking for jobs among the growing
number of local ventures or in development zones. Township
enterprises are still the main route for surplus laborers.
Industrial, commercial, food service, construction and transport
fields are the most common areas where farmers get a job.

<HEADLINE> Saudi King Welcomes Iran's Invitation to Islamic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Saudi King Fahd has welcomed
Iran's invitation to him to attend an Islamic summit due in Tehran
in December, reports from the Saudi kingdom said today.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) said the visiting Iranian Foreign
Minister Ali Akbar Velayati conveyed the invitation from President
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani during a meeting with King Fahd late last
night.
</P>
<P>
Velayati, who who arrived in the Saudi capital of Riyadh
Saturday, told a press conference after meeting the Saudi King
that "King Fahd welcomed the invitation and said he would
participate as much as it would be possible for him," according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister is currently on a tour to
countries of the region to extend invitations to heads of states
and governments of Muslim countries for the 8th summit of the
Organization of Islamic Countries (OIC), the world's largest
Muslim body.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Velayati also held talks with the Saudi
Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal AL-Saud during which they
discussed such topics as security and bilateral trade exchange,
disputed islands with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the issue
of Jerusalem as well as the Gulf situation.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister was quoted by the KUNA as saying after the
talks they tackled a part of the issue such as trade cooperation
and the discussions would continue.
</P>
<P>
"Consolidating cooperation to ensure security is also an
Iranian demand, and the door is open," he said.
</P>
<P>
But concerning reports about an unannounced non-aggression
accord among Gulf states, he said "I am not aware where such an
accord or treaty had been prepared."
</P>
<P>
"Let me assure you that there is concurrence among us as to
arrangements for stability and arriving at security measures in
the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the disputed islands between Iran and the UAE,
he said that Iran "has always expressed readiness to start direct
talks with the UAE and there is a known accord signed by us and
the UAE," adding that the agreement, in which the British
Foreign Ministry was then a part, "should be the basis for any
talks between the two sides."
</P>
<P>
The disputed Islands in the Gulf have been held by Iran but
also claimed by the United Arab Emirates, resulting in the
strained relations between Iran and the Gulf Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The UAE is a close political and economic ally of Saudi Arabia
in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) which also groups Kuwait,
Oman, Bahrain and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is the second leg of Velayati's 10-nation tour
which first took him to Uganda and will also take him to other
Gulf Arab states, Turkey, Sudan and Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
Velayati had just completed a tour of Southeast Asia in a bid
to getting support for the summit meeting. An Iranian source
said recently that Saudi Arabia's presence would be "crucial"
because the Saudis "have the capacity to make or break the
conference."
</P>
<P>
Riyadh and Tehran, two of the world's biggest oil exporters,
are also at odds over the presence of U.S. and other Western
forces in the Gulf. Iran is critical of the West presence,
including about 5,000 U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, which Iran
says contributes to regional tension.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and its Gulf Arab allies have accused Iran of
interfering in their internal affairs, and voiced concern over
its arms build-up. But Iran denies the charges.
</P>
<P>
Velayati will leave Saudi Arabia for Muscat, Oman later
today.

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia's Ethnic Women Competing in Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Ethnic minority women in north
China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have found new ways of
making money through self-improvement.
</P>
<P>
Lai Xiao, a Mongolian herdswoman of the Hulun Buir League, won
an award in 1995 from UNESCO for her contributions to agriculture
and animal husbandry, by using a new method of lamb-delivery in
winter. With the new method, her flock of a little more than 100
sheep in 1987 increased dramatically to the present 4,000.
</P>
<P>
Lai Xiao is only one of the 600,000-plus ethnic minority women
in the league who have benefitted from a campaign started by local
women's federations to help poor women become literate and to
learn new techniques for their work.
</P>
<P>
The league was approved by the state in 1988 as an economic
reform trial zone in China's ethnic minority areas. Improving the
quality of women's lives was put high on their list of
goals. Women's federations provide information and technical
services free of charge and hold training classes and give
lectures, and 320,000 women of various ethnic groups have mastered
one or two practical skills, and more than 20,000 women have
obtained agriculture or animal husbandry technician certificates.
</P>
<P>
Wu Xueqing, an Oroqen hunter in the Oroqen Autonomous Banner,
has left poverty far behind by growing edible fungus. More than
100 Oroqen women now have adequate food and clothing because they
followed her example.
</P>
<P>
In the Morin Dawa Daur Autonomous Banner, a Daur woman, Liu
Jinfeng, has become known as the "queen of grain". By using
scientific farming techniques, she sold more than one million
kilograms of grain to the state in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Another Daur, Leng Xueyan, set up a gardening service,
providing saplings, flowers, and flower seeds. Her annual income
is said to be nearly 100,000 yuan now and local people call her
"the girl of flowers".
</P>
<P>
Ethnic minority women also show a strong tendency for
competitiveness in other forms of business. Qu Xiuqin, the
Mongolian manager of the Buir Catering Trade Group Corporation in
the city of Hailar, transformed an enterprise that was suffering
from heavy losses into the best in the sector in the region. In
doing so, she was honoured with the title of state model worker.
</P>
<P>
There are many more female directors and managers like Qu who
are making greater contributions to the economic development of
the ethnic minority areas.

<HEADLINE> TB Poses Threat to Millions of Africans Every </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Over 1.6 million Africans
develop active tuberculosis (tb) every year and many of them will
die without any help having been available to them, according to
a report by the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
According to the report, at least one-third of the population
in Africa is already infected with tb. Only 10 percnet of these
people would ever become sick as the bacillus can remain dormant
for many years, waiting for illness, undernourishment, or fatigue
to weaken the immune system sufficiently so as to encourage
active disease to arise.
</P>
<P>
Since many tb patients in the region are receiving improper or
inadequate treatment which does not provide a complete cure for
their disease, the patients continue to infect others.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that over the next five years, if nothing is
done, Africa will face 10 million new cases of tb, of which as
many as 3.6 million will die, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, tb has become the top 10 causes of hospital and
health center visits and the 3rd leading cause of hospital
admission in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
According to local press report, over the last 10 years the
number of total cases reported to the country's health
institutions has almost doubled.

<HEADLINE> EU Agrees to Send Military, Police Advisers to Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
APELDOORN, Netherlands, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Union
(EU) agreed today to send military and police advisers to Albania
to help restore order there.
</P>
<P>
Meeting informally in the Het Loo Palace, a 17th century former
royal residence in the Dutch town of Apeldoorn, the EU ministers
also agreed to consider providing protection for this mission if
necessary, but stressed this was not a military operation.
</P>
<P>
"The EU is strongly committed to helping Albania restore
civilian structures and law and order," the ministers said in a
statement after their two-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
"External assistance is needed immediately for the restoration
of security in particular in and around Tirana," they said.
</P>
<P>
"Among the member states there was readiness to send an
Advisory Mission in the civilian as well as police and military
fields," they stated, adding that the mission would require a
mandate from the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
It was also agreed that a high-level mission would be sent by
the Dutch EU Presidency to Tirana on Monday, comprising
representatives from Albania's EU neighbors Greece and Italy, the
European Commission and the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
The ministers also called on Albania to take responsibility for
rebuilding the country and the society.
</P>
<P>
They said the European Commission was ready to provide
humanitarian assistance "as soon as conditions are sufficiently
secure to assure its delivery."
</P>
<P>
The ministers also agreed that further steps would be
coordinated with the OSCE as well as the Council of Europe.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, deep split emerged among ministers of the
15-nation bloc regarding whether or not to send troops to Albania
that has been in the grip of unrest since January after the
collapse of pyramid investment schemes in which thousands of
Albanians lost their life savings.
</P>
<P>
The protest turned violent more than two weeks ago as rebels
looted weapons from army depots. Several cities in the southern
part of the country are now controlled by rebels.
</P>
<P>
Tirana itself has also witnessed growing unrest as mobs looted
a warehouse of 650 tons of flour last Thursday and raided security
force depots in search of guns.
</P>
<P>
Albanian President Sali Berisha deployed tanks in front of the
main institutions in the country and called on the EU to provide
military assistance to Tirana to restore order.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Italy, Greece, Denmark and France were in favor
of military intervention of some sort, while Britain, Germany and
Sweden were vehemently opposed to this action.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel on Saturday ruled out any
option of his country sending troops to Albania and warned against
hasty military intervention. "German soldiers will not go into
Albania," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind called it "premature"
to talk about military intervention from outside Albania.
</P>
<P>
Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen, whose country
holds the OSCE presidency, however, endorsed the dispatch of
troops saying a "stabilization force" with a "clear mandate and an
exit strategy" should be sent quickly.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak: US Committed to Middle East Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
following his week-long three-nation tour, claimed today that the
United States is committed to its role as a sponsor and partner
in the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The different perceptions of Egypt and the U.S. now and then
could not mar our bilateral ties," said Mubarak in his first
public appearance since he returned home Saturday night from his
March 8-15 tour, which has taken him to France, the U.S. and
Morocco.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Egyptian T.V. program "Good Morning
Egypt," the Egyptian president said the U.S. veto of a
European-sponsored resolution condemning the Israeli decision to
set up 6,500 Jewish homes in East Jerusalem does not mean that
the U.S. is against the right of Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Therefore the veto would have "no impact on the strong ties"
between Egypt and the U.S., he said, adding that though he wished
the U.S. had not used the veto in "an urgent matter unacceptable
by Arabs."
</P>
<P>
On the eve of Mubarak's arrival in Washington, the U.S. vetoed
a U.N. Security Council resolution despite its announced
opposition to Israel's plan of building new settlements in
occupied Arab territories, especially in Jerusalem, which both
the Palestinian National Authority and Israel want to have as the
capital of their states.
</P>
<P>
When asked about his visit to Morocco and his expectation on
rallying Arab and Islamic stands on the peace process, Mubarak
said after the 70-minute talks with King Hassan II of Morocco,
they decided to convene the 15 member-Al Quds (Jerusalem)
Committee in March to examine the latest developments related to
the holy city.
</P>
<P>
The committee, made of Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, Guinea,
Indonesia, Iran, Niger, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Pakistan,
Senegal, Iraq, Syria, Mauritania and the Palestinian National
Authority, was set up by a summit of the Organization of Islamic
Conference back in 1974 with the aim of preventing the city, holy
to Muslims, Christians and Jews alike from Judaization by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat is expected to brief the
committee on the outcome of his contacts with countries that
backed the Oslo accord at an international conference in Gaza
Saturday. King Hassan II will chair the committee meeting and
explain the results of his contacts to contain the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Inquired about his visit to Paris, which reportedly was an
important leg in all his foreign tours, Mubarak said that he has
a "very good" relationships with French leaders, including
President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, he dismissed the claim that France has
adopted a stance favoring the Arabs while the U.S. is siding with
the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
"The French president is convinced of the justice of our cause
and I cannot say that there is a pro-Arab side or another side
biased to Israel," he added.
</P>
<P>
"All of us favor justice until a fair and lasting peace is
realized. This is the view of Paris and all European states as
well as the U.S.," he said.
</P>
<P>
On his way to Washington, Mubarak stopped in Paris last Friday
for talks with Chirac on Egyptian and French efforts to realize a
comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the tweo countries agreed that there was "a
complete agreement of viewpoints on the peace process, bilateral
relations and international questions.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein Pays Condolence Visit To Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 16 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan arrived
in Israel this afternoon for a nine-hour goodwill visit in the
wake of the bloody incident in which seven schoolgirls were shot
dead by a lone Jordanian soldier in Naharayim Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The monarch, who is accompanied by Prince Faisal and Princess
Aisha arrived at Ben Guriton Airport and received by Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The king went directly to Beit Shemish for condolence
visits to the bereaved families of the seven Israeli schoolgirls
despite the rain.
</P>
<P>
According to the schedule issued by the Government Press
Office Saturday night, the King then will proceed to
Hadassah-University Hospital in Jerusalem's Ein Kerem to visit a
girl pupil and a teacher wounded in the incident, and to
see President Ezer Weizman who underwent surgery in the same
hospital.
</P>
<P>
The king and Netanyahu are scheduled to hold talks this
evening, which will be followed by a joint press conference
in King David Hotel.
</P>
<P>
Hussein has so far declined to make an official visit to
Jerusalem. The last time he was in the city was for prime
minister Yitzhak Rabin's funeral in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that Israel hopes to use the visit
to improve the strained relations with Jordan and soften
Jordan's position regarding Israel's decision to build a new
Jewish settlement at Har Homa in the Arab East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Put On Alert For Letter Bombs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 16 (Xinhua)-- Zimbabwe's Posts and
Telecommunications Corporation (PTC) has been put on alert for
letter bombs allegedly being sent to American targets throughout
the world including those in Zimbabwe, the Sunday Mail reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The letter bombs are believed to be coming from Egyptian
terrorists but an official at the Egyptian embassy in Harare said
joint efforts by Egyptian and American security agents to trace
the origin of the letters in Cairo were not successful.
</P>
<P>
This was being done by people bent on tarnishing Egypt, he
said. "These people are forging Egyptian stamps and postal marks.
It's very easy to forge these things and make them appear
authentic. Evidence shows that nothing was coming out of Cairo,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He, however, confirmed that the letter bombs were being
targeted at Americans and most of the bombs were sent to New York
and one had exploded at a New York newspaper office injuring two
people who were trying to open or examine the letters.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials within the PTC confirmed to the Sunday Mail
that a warning had been sent out by the Switzerland-based
universal postal union for all postal centres to look out for the
letter bombs. The PTC security department was on alert and all
mail with Egyptian postal marks or stamps was being treated with
extreme caution and subjected to "extensive security testing".

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Women Still Marginalised: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 16 (Xinhua) -- A senior government official
said yesterday Zimbabwe will not develop as long as women are
marginalised and denied access to land and credit to start their
own businesses.
</P>
<P>
While discussing women's role in society, secretary for
National Affairs, Employment Creation and Cooperatives Ministry
Tendai Bare-Machirori said there was need to intensify efforts to
economically empower women and eradicate poverty in the country.
</P>
<P>
She said since women constitute more than half of Zimbabwe's
11 million population, they were an important human resource base
and excluding them from positions of power would retard
development of society.
</P>
<P>
She said her ministry would soon come up with a three-year
project to help women enter politics,
</P>
<P>
The project was aimed at increasing participation of all women
in political life, and particular focus would be on this year's
urban and rural district council elections as well as the general
elections in the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Observers Thumbs-up Nigeria's Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Some foreign observers in Nigeria
to monitor its local government elections have described the
election on Saturday as peaceful, democratic and a hitch-free
exercise, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Two of them, Ronald Israel of the Congress of the Racial
Equality and Henry Johnson of the City News, were quoted as
saying that they were satisfied with the arrangement and conduct
of the election in all the pollng stations they visited in Kaduna
metropolis, northern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
They were impressed by the enthusiasm exhibited by voters,
which clearly showed Nigeria was on the path of democracy.
</P>
<P>
Joe Lovice, a member of the Congress for Racial Equality
(CRE), said "as a civil rights organization, we are interested in
the situation in Nigeria and we have keenly been following it."
</P>
<P>
He said his team will not report the CRE but will directly
report to the Congress of the United States government.
</P>
<P>
The results of the local government elections and the faithful
execution of the transition to civil rule program of the Nigerian
government would determine if the American Congress would lift
sanctions against Nigeria, he added.
</P>
<P>
In Ibadan, southwestern Nigeria, an international observer
team of three acting under the aegis of America for Democracy in
Africa, visited some polling centers.
</P>
<P>
Joans Wallace, leader of the team, praised the conduct of the
election, describing it as "very orderly".
</P>
<P>
Wallace, whose team also monitored Nigeria's council election
on zero-party basis early last year, expressed faith in the
Nigerian government's capability in bequeathing enduring
democratic rule to the country.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 38 observers from the United States, who form the
Election Witness Team, arrived in the West African country on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The observers, including journalists, publishers, religious
leaders, political activists and members of non-governmental
organizations, were in various parts of Nigeria to monitor the
election.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's election has so far widely described as fair and
peaceful, only with some complaints, especially on shortage of
materials and delayed voting.
</P>
<P>
The result of ballots counting is yet to be known.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics said about 56 million Nigerians were
registered as voters nationwide, which is slightly more than half
of the whole population.
</P>
<P>
It is not known at this moment how many people have actually
voted. The Chairman of the National Electoral Commission of
Nigeria (NECON), Chief Summer Dagogo-Jack has said in Aubja, the
national capital, the commission is impressed by the large
turn-out of the voters.
</P>
<P>
But according to the figure gathered by our reporter at a
polling station on Victoria Island, Lagos, only less than 300 of
the 800 registered voters have voted.

<HEADLINE> Primakov, Albright hold talks for Helsinki Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
held talks on Saturday for preparation of Helsinki summit between
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking forward to having a good meeting," Albright
said as she welcomed Primakov to her office. The Russian foreign
minister arrived in Washington this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of Primakov's talks in Washington with U.S.
leaders, including Defense Secretary Williams Cohen on Sunday and
President Bill Clinton on Monday, is to try to find guidelines for
a new round of U.S. and Russian arms control and to narrow
differences on NATO enlargement.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and his government has been opposed to NATO's plan to
invite former member states of the Warsaw Pact when NATO holds a
summit in Madrid in July and to the deployment of conventional
weapons to the territory of Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin registered his objections again on Friday to the NATO
enlargement, saying, "What the Americans are proposing -- moving
conventional weapons to the territory of Eastern Europe -- would
amount to a 'cordon sanitaire'. We won't go along with that."
</P>
<P>
But the United States ruled out any limits on the NATO
enlargement or the weapons that new members could bring into the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
While the United States has offered several concessions to
counter Russia's objections to NATO enlargement, it would not
negotiate limits on new members.
</P>
<P>
The United States, trying to placate Russia, has proposed a
charter, defining Russia's ties with the Western alliance,
including granting Russia full membership in the G-7 group.
</P>
<P>
Another issue on the agenda during Primakov's talks with U.S.
leaders is to produce guidelines for reducing their nuclear
weapons arsenals beyond the sharp cut provided by the 1993 START
II treaty.
</P>
<P>
The Russian parliament is balking at ratifying the START II
treaty as it would strip Russia of its most potent long-range
warheads.
</P>
<P>
Since there is no progress made on the issue of START II on the
side of Russia, there is no movement on proposed follow-on START
III reductions.

KUNMING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- A team of Chinese scientists at
the Yunnan Observatory have succeeded in transmitting pictures of
their observation through the Internet to their counterparts in
Beijing, and British, Canadian and American cities.
</P>
<P>
On March 6 and 7, astronomers including Ji Kaifan and Song
Qian at the Yunnan Observatory managed to conduct observations
with their advanced equipment and compress pictures which were
transmitted through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
They sent the pictures to Ye Binxun at the Beijing Observatory,
Chu Yi, a visiting Chinese scholar in Florida in the United
States, Doug Paulson in Utah in the US, Vince Wardhaugh in Toronto,
Canada, and Adrian Jupe in South Ampton, Britain.
</P>
<P>
On receiving the pictures from the Internet, the scientists in
different places held discussions and then made suggestions to the
observers in Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
In two days, scientists at the Kunming Observatory conducted
14 hours of observation with a cost of only 400 yuan (48 US
dollars) for the telecommunication fee.

<HEADLINE> All 88 on board C-130 Aircraft Confirmed Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 16 (Xinhua) -- All 88 passengers and crew
members of Iran's C-130 military plane that crashed over
Binaloud heights in northeastern Iran on Thursday are killed, an
official report said today.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the announcement
was made by Iran's armed forces in a statement issued here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the reason for the crash about
700 km northeast of Tehran, is not known yet but a special
investigation team from the air force is probing into the
incident.
</P>
<P>
It added that as soon as any information become available
the nation will be informed.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that all passengers of the ill-fated plane
were either military personnel or their family members.
</P>
<P>
The last contact of the pilot with the control tower was
made at 18:06 hours local time (14:36 GMT) on Thursday. It
is assumed that the plane went down following its last contact
with the control tower.
</P>
<P>
The plane was en route from Dezful in southwestern Iran
to the religious city of Mashhad in the northeastern province
of Khorasan.
</P>
<P>
This was the second air mishap in 10 days in the
country. The last air crash occurred on March 3 as a
French-made Falcon aircraft crashed 25 km northeast of Ardebil
city in northeastern Iran. The Falcon pilot and three flight
engineers died in the Ardebil crash.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Head of State Reportedly Avoids Voting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's head of state General
Sani Abacha, and the First Lady Maryam, did not vote during
Saturday's local government elections although they have
registered as number one and two voters.
</P>
<P>
The move, according to Sunday Champion today, is possibly to
step-aside notions of officially favoring any political party.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Chief of the General Staff Lt.-Gen. Oladipo Diya
did not vote either, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, major newspapers in the country carried the
explanations of Col. Mohammed Marwa, the military administrator
of Lagos state, who also declined to vote.
</P>
<P>
"I took the decision (not to vote) to avoid
misrepresentation," Marwa was quoted as saying during his tour on
Saturday to one of 8,000 polling centers in the state.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the time, you discover that when a chief executive
decides to cash his vote, chances are that some speculations will
follow and the public will be misinformed," he said, adding that
he did not want to "run into that kind of problem".
</P>
<P>
According to press reports, key government functionaries,
including state administrators and ministers, may be drawing on
the experience of the past.
</P>
<P>
In 1979, the then head of state General Olusegun Obasanjo and
his deputy Maj.-Gen. Shehu Musa Yar Adua voted in the secret
ballot, midwifing the second republic.
</P>
<P>
But opponents fished out their votes and their choice of party
was leaked to the press. Both leaders were accused of bias in the
unfolding tranistion process.
</P>
<P>
The measure that top government functionaries are barred from
Saturday's election is reported to portray them as neutral
umpires in the transition to civil rule program of the country.

<HEADLINE> HK Police Vow to Stop Drug Use at Parties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong police have vowed to
step up measures to stop the use of drugs on the local dance party
scene despite complaints about a mass search last weekend.
</P>
<P>
District Operations Officer of Central, Chief Inspector Patrick
Hodson, said undercover and uniformed police would closely monitor
what he called "rave-type" parties until drug-trafficking at these
events stops.
</P>
<P>
In an unprecedented move, police raided a party in Central last
weekend and searched all the 150 party-goers, staff and the
premises, according to the English-language newspaper Hong Kong
Standard here today.
</P>
<P>
A warrant was issued days before the party by Western
Magistracy on the basis that past arrests for the possession and
sale of drugs had been made at such events, Hodson said.
</P>
<P>
The raid resulted in two arrests and the seizure of a variety
of suspected drugs, including cocaine, eight Ecstasy tablets, a
cannabis joint, a sealed straw believed to contain heroine and two
syringes with possible traces of heroin, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Although some of the party-goers questioned the operation,
Inspector Hodson was quick to defend it. "Any drugs seized and
arrests made is a success in my mind," he said.

<HEADLINE> Confrontation is Doomed to Failure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- In the first week of the 53rd
session of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, some developed
countries again pursued political confrontation with developing
countries, just as they did in the previous years.
</P>
<P>
Despite justified calls from developing nations to strengthen
cooperation, delegates from two European countries spared no
efforts to attack developing countries at the session for their
human rights practices, creating a tense atmosphere of
confrontation not expected by the international community.
</P>
<P>
The international community has hoped to promote human rights
through dialogue within the framework of the Commission on Human
Rights, on the basis of equality and mutual respect of sovereignty
and under the United Nations Charter and the Vienna Declaration
and Program of Action.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the session, which began on March 10, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan called for a growing alliance of
efforts all over the world for the realization of basic rights and
fundamental freedoms.
</P>
<P>
Xavier Emmanuelli, French State Secretary for Urgent
Humanitarian Action, in his speech, also stressed the need for
dialogue and consensus.

<P>
The Non-Aligned Movement and China tabled a draft resolution
entitled "Enhancement of International Cooperation in the Field of
Human Rights," which once again called for cooperation, at the
51st session of the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
But developed countries, pursuing political confrontation, cast
negative votes on the resolution supported by 112 U.N. members,
rejecting the call for consensus by a majority of developing
nations.
</P>
<P>
Following the Cold War, Western powers turned the forum of the
Commission on Human Rights into a place of confrontation between
the North and the South. Posing as human rights judges, they
directly targeted the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
During the commission's previous sessions, they pursued
confrontation and produced numerous draft resolutions against
developing countries, politicizing the human rights issue and
practicing double-standards.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, some Western countries, portraying human
rights "models" and "judges," have made every effort to attack
developing countries with so-called human rights abuses while
turning a blind eye to their own inglorious human rights record.
In fact, they have turned the commission into a "court" where they
put developing countries on trial. This, of course, has met with
strong opposition from more and more developing countries.

China, the largest developing country of the world, is one of
their major targets. Over the past six years, there have been six
attempts against China. But all the attempts have failed because
of the strong opposition from a majority of the commission's
members countries.
</P>
<P>
However, a few developed countries have learned no lesson from
their failures.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the commission's current session, the foreign
ministers from the Netherlands and a Nordic country went so far as
to attack China and other developing countries by name.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that different views have emerged inside the
alliance of developed countries on whether to cooperate with
developing countries to promote human rights or to stick to
confrontation, a few developed countries, out of their prejudice
and political need, are still following their road of collision
with developing countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 16 (Xinhua) -- With the opening of the first
hospice for AIDS patients here on Saturday, Hong Kong's AIDS care
workers made more headway.
</P>
<P>
The Tai Po Lookout will initially provide care for five
residential and 10 day-care patients, according to local press
reports.
</P>
<P>
But the Society for AIDS Care hopes to expand the site by next
summer to accommodate a further 16 full-time patients.
</P>
<P>
Demand for the hospice and home care is growing as Hong Kong's
AIDS sufferers increase. New AIDS cases last year soared by 42
percent to bring the total number of sufferers in the city to 228,
the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The five residential patients are awaiting the completion of
minor renovations so they can move into the building, leased to
the society for one year.
</P>
<P>
The renovation costs totaled 4.5 million HK dollars (about
590,000 U.S. dollars), the reports said.

At a recent press conference, Dutch Foreign Minister Hans Van
Mierlo claimed that the European Union was prepared to table an
anti-China draft resolution. But he also had to admit that no
final decision was made.
</P>
<P>
In their speech, delegates from many developing countries voiced
their opposition to confrontation and the politicizing of
the human rights issue and called for international cooperation on
promoting human rights. They also expressed strong opposition to
attempts by some developed countries to interfere into other
countries' internal affairs by politicizing the human rights issue
and imposing their views on other countries.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jianmin, head of the Chinese delegation, said that China
calls for cooperation and hopes to avoid confrontation. If some
developed countries choose to impose confrontation on us and
continue name calling, we will have no alternative but keep
company.
</P>
<P>
History has proven that attempts by a few developed countries,
which are playing power politics, to impose their human rights
standards and values on the majority of the international
community are doomed to failure.

<HEADLINE> Uganda, Sudan Talks Fail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Talks to end hostility between
Uganda and Sudan have failed after three days of intensive
discussions, reported the local daily "the New Vision" today.
</P>
<P>
Mediators for the talks from Iran and Malawi were very
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's first deputy prime minister and minister of foreign
affairs Eriya Kategaya, who led the Ugandan delegation was
quoted as saying," for a change today (Saturday), we only issued
a statement instead of a communique as usual because we failed to
come up with what should be a communique."
</P>
<P>
Kategaya who spoke to the paper shortly after the aborted
talks yesterday at the Entebbe airport, 40 km south of here,
attributed their failure to the downgrading of the talks by Sudan
and the kidnapping of children from Uganda to Sudan.
</P>
<P>
He said, all the meetings had been at the head of state level
or full ministers but Sudan has decided to send a civial servant,
a first under secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Sudan was represented by under secretary Ali Elnimari, who
could not commit his country at a higher political level.
</P>
<P>
On kidnapping of children from Uganda to Sudan, he said," 26
girls are still in rebel captivity at a place called Aruu in
Sudan."
</P>
<P>
Sudan never wanted it included in a communique on the talks,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Malawi and Iran had agreed to sign a joint letter regarding
the matter, but Malawi later withdrew because they failed to come
to a consensus on the wording.
</P>
<P>
The talks, held in Entebbe were chaired by the Iranian
minister of foreign affairs Ali Akhbar Velayati. The Malwian
foreign minister Nga Mtafu also attended as a mediator.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was to review and re-assess the situation
regarding the nomalisation of the Uganda-Sudan relations since
the last meeting held in Tehran from November 3-4 last year.
</P>
<P>
However, Kategaya was optimistic that the failure of the talks
does not mean the end of the whole process of searching for
peace. "We still have the door open... if Sudan becomes open, we
shall go by that," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sudan and Uganda have denounced each other for supporting
other country's rebels.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Rebel Leader Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kampala, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Juma Oris, the leader of the
rebel West Nile Bank Front (WNBF), was killed, military sources
confirmed yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader was killed in a battle between his troops and
the government troops earlier yesterday near the Uganda-Sudan
border, "the Monitor" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The WNBF rebels were suffering three major blows recently:
they have lost major camp bases in eastern Zaire in the wake of
the advance of Zairean rebels, their camp bases in southern Sudan
also have fallen in the offensive of Sudanese rebels, they
incurred a major loss in the last few weeks during the operations
launched by the government troops in north-western Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Juma Oris was the former land minister and then was
transferred to be minister of information and finally the foreign
minister under the rein of former dictator Idi Amin. He went to
exile in Sudan after the collapse of Amin's regime in 1979 and
formed the WNBF in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The death of Juma Oris is a notable victory of the government
troops in the north. Yoweri Museveni, the commander-in-chief of
the armed forces and the president of Uganda, put forward a new
strategy to eliminate the rebellion in the north recently.
President Museveni and Mugisha Muntu, the army commander, are
still in the north to oversee army operations there.
</P>
<P>
There are two main rebel groups acting in northern Uganda:
WNBF and the lord's resistance army. The main forces of lra
retreated to southern Sudan.

<HEADLINE> Depositors' Clear Identities Required </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- A local tax expert called for the
establishment of a new deposit system requiring individuals to use
real names when opening savings accounts, according the Business
Weekly of today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The system would help reduce tax evasion and increase state
revenue, the paper quoted an expert as saying.
</P>
<P>
Depositors' identities would be linked with the income tax
information and would enable financial departments to learn
depositors' actual incomes. It would tighten inspection of
personal income tax and help taxation institutions collect taxes,
said Li Bengui, a researcher with State Taxation Administration.
</P>
<P>
Under the existing system, people can open several accounts
without using their real names.
</P>
<P>
The export believed that electronic networks now installed in
all major banks enable the rules to be adopted.
</P>
<P>
Under China's existing tax system, value-added taxes, business
taxes and sales taxes are the main sources of tax revenue, at
least 60 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese tax collectors last year registered 19.3 billion
yuan in income tax, up 46.8 percent from the previous year. The
figure, however, is "far from satisfactory," as the expert put it.
</P>
<P>
Even the tax rate remained low, tax evasion is also rampant, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Insufficient methods for investigating workers' earnings is
believed one of the key reasons for the evasion.
</P>
<P>
Chinese people have deposited more than 3,800 billion yuan in
personal savings accounts last year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe China can collect billions of yuan from taxing
saving's interest, which will substantially contribute to state
revenue.

<HEADLINE> Peru Considers Ex-Ecuadoran Minister's Asylum Request </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Peruvian government is
considering whether to grant asylum to Enrique Villon, former
Ecuadoran finance minister under the deposed president Abdala
Bucaram, the local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Enrique Villon entered Peru "illegally" last week, carrying an
official passport "that did not give him permission to leave
(Ecuador) nor to enter (Peru)," Peruvian Interior Minister Cesar
Verduga was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Villon was picked up by Peruvian police on March 8 during a
sweep for illegal immigrants in the northern border town of Aguas
Verdes.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that he would be subject to persecution and
assassination in Ecuador, Villon said he would seek asylum in Peru.
</P>
<P>
However, Verduga said last Sunday that Villon would be returned
to Ecuador on March 10 where he was sought in a wide-ranging
investigation into corruption in the Bucaram administration.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Villon officially requested political asylum from
the Peruvian Foreign Ministry, and was moved on Friday to a
detention center in Lima for "security reason."
</P>
<P>
Bucaram, who fled to Panama, was ousted February 6 on charges
of corruption and incompetence after six months in office.
</P>
<P>
He was accused of stealing 28 million dollars from federal
funds and international loans. A senior legislator has claimed
that Bucaram and some of his closest aides had grabbed nearly 58
million dollars from "special funds."
</P>
<P>
Villon was reportedly carrying some 3.4 million dollars with
him when he entered Peru.

<HEADLINE> HK Hotel Gears Up Preparations for World Rugby Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Hotel Furama has
geared up its preparations for accommodating some 250 players for
the coming World Cup Rugby Sevens just five days away -- and food
first.
</P>
<P>
To satisfy the mammoth appetite of the rugby players from
around the world is nothing easy, especially when a banana fetish
tops an already hefty menu.
</P>
<P>
The refrigerators and storerooms at the hotel are being stocked
up with a record amount of food in anticipation of the arrival
this week of 24 rugby teams for the three-day sporting event.
</P>
<P>
The players are expected to consume more in one meal than the
hotel usually serves to all its guests in one day, according to
the English-language newspaper Hong Kong Standard here today.
</P>
<P>
"The real challenge has been satisfying a demand for bananas,"
the report said.
</P>
<P>
For just one breakfast, food expected to be consumed include
120 kilograms of bananas, 90 loaves of toasting bread, 50 loaves
of measly bread, 35 kilograms of rice and 720 eggs, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
And to go down with this, the players need 100 liters of fresh
orange juice, 60 liters of carrot juice and 80 liters of fruit
punch.
</P>
<P>
"While the order for just one meal is practically double the
amount of food and drink consumed by the entire hotel in a day,
we've ordered triple the number of bananas we've ever required in
a day before," said Elizabeth Iron, the hotel's public relations
and advertising manager.
</P>
<P>
But these guests had made no extra request for alcohol
consumption, Iron said.
</P>
<P>
"They don't drink. Well, until it's all over, of course.
They're professional players so drinking is a definite no-no," she
added.

<HEADLINE> Two U.S. Airlines Accused of Tax Evasion in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Two U.S. airlines, Delta
Airlines and United Airlines, have not paid taxes on their incomes
collectively amounting to 80 million rupees (2.25 million U.S.
dollars) in India over the last few years.
</P>
<P>
Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) sources said here
today that the DRI came across evidence of the alleged tax evasion
while probing the airlines' reported misuse of customs duty
exemptions on baggage screening machines.
</P>
<P>
India's Customs Department granted the former Pan Am Airlines
duty exemption for installing a baggage screening machine at the
Delhi and Mumbai (Bombay) international airports in 1989. The
exemption was granted on condition that it would use the two
machines only for its own passengers.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, Pan Am Airlines was taken over by Delta Airlines and
the former's Delhi route was taken over by the United Airlines in
December 1995.
</P>
<P>
Investigations have revealed that the two U.S. airlines had
allowed passengers of other airlines to use the screening
machines. It was later discovered that the airlines had charged
other airlines a rental fee. No tax, however, was paid to the
Indian authorities on the rental income, the DRI sources said.

<P>
NEW DELHI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- After the budget boom at the
end of February and early March and a big crash in the subsequent
week, this week's Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) market activity
remained relatively calm.
</P>
<P>
Although Monday began with a crash of around 101 points, the
market recovered by the end of the day. Tuesday's trading
witnessed a renewed vigor although not many gains could be
sustained. The Sensitive Index finished with a 36-point rise. With
a 13-point jump the next day and a loss of three and nine points
over the two subsequent sessions, trading remained sluggish.
</P>
<P>
The market was through with technical correction and all poised
for yet another rally, market men said.
</P>
<P>
This week's net loss of just about nine points was indicative
of the nervousness slowly vanishing. The Sensitive Index was
steady at 3,745 level. A renewed rally might take the Sensitive
Index to the 3,900-point level, they said.
</P>
<P>
If the political scenario remains stable, there is no cause of
worry, they added.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition to Announce Action Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The main opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) leader Khaleda Zia Saturday said she would
announce a tough action program against the government on April 3.
</P>
<P>
The program would gradually culminate in widespread agitation,
she said, indicating that her party might go for a nationwide
strike at the end of its on-going agitation across the country.
</P>
<P>
"There is no time to wait and see any more, since the
government has completed its conspiracy to hand the country's
sovereignty over to India," the opposition leader told a gathering
of followers at her official residence here Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The gathering was organized on the occasion of joining the BNP
by a number of lawyers from Narayanganj District. Advocate Taimur
Alam Khondoker led the newcomers along with his 3,000 supporters.
</P>
<P>
Khaleda Zia, the former prime minister, said the present
government of Sheikh Hasina failed in all fronts during its
nine-month rule. "The country's sovereignty and democracy are at
stake and the nation has plunged into an abysmal situation due to
the misrule."
</P>
<P>
Referring to her arch-rival Hasina's call for cooperation,
Khaleda posed the question: "How can one cooperate with a
government which is selling out the country and making the lives
of people intolerable?"
</P>
<P>
She said Indian hegemony has been already established in
Bangladesh in the spheres of trade and commerce.
</P>
<P>
Blaming the ruling Awami League, Zia said the current power
crisis has been created intentionally to import electricity from
India.
</P>
<P>
She also criticized the government for extending transit to
India while keeping the nation in total darkness about it.
</P>
<P>
"The government has entered into a more stringent agreement
with India. It would jeopardize the future of the nation and make
it the target of insurgency from across the border," she warned.

HAVANA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Forty-two foreign-funded
enterprises have been set up in Cuba since the United States
passed the Helms-Burton law in March last year to discourage
foreign investment in the island nation, the local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Of the more than 260 foreign-funded companies in Cuba, 80 were
set up after the country passed the law on foreign investment in
September 1995.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-six were established in 1996, the official daily Granma
reported and 53 percent of the total were funded by member
countries of European Union.
</P>
<P>
Most of the investment came from Spain, Canada, Italy, France,
Mexico, the Netherlands and Britain, which operate about 200 of
such firms.
</P>
<P>
Cuba's first joint venture was established in the tourism
sector nine years ago. So far, there are 30 joint ventures engaged
in oil extraction, 85 in industries, and 45 in tourism.
</P>

Cuba has signed agreements with 19 countries to promote and
protect investment in the country, and are negotiating 30 similar

<HEADLINE> India Criticizes Developed Nations for Barriers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Federation of Indian Export
Organizations (FIEO) has criticized developed countries for
various non-tariff barriers against developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The concept of "eco-friendliness" is posing a threat to
products of developing countries and is virtually acting as a
non-tariff barrier, the FIEO said.
</P>
<P>
The developed countries are increasingly resorting to
non-trading barriers to keep a check on their imports and this is
hindering India's efforts to export more, an FIEO official quoted
his Director General R. K. Dhawan as saying here today.
</P>
<P>
Countries in Europe and America manage to raise one issue or
another in the guise of environmental protection (or child labor)
without bothering about the difficulties faced by Third-World
countries. The FIEO has taken up the issue with the Commerce
Ministry and expressed its deep concern about the use of
eco-labeling programs as trade barriers against exports from
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"A strong written submission should be made to the Committee on
Trade and Environment and the World Trade Organization on the
misuse of the eco-labeling schemes to create barriers to imports
from developing countries," Dhawan said.

<P>
PANAMA CITY, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Panama had a trade deficit of
616.2 million U.S. dollars in 1996, the Panamanian Comptrollership
said in a communique today.
</P>
<P>
The deficit was caused by a decline in most of the country's
exports, and an increase in imports, according to the document.
</P>
<P>
Panama imported 6.231 billion dollars worth of goods in 1996, a
rise of 6.1 percent from the previous year, against an export of
5.615 billion dollars worth of goods.
</P>
<P>
Banana, one of the country's major export products, accounted
for 31.1 percent of the exports, representing a 4 percent
reduction compared with 1995.
</P>
<P>
Fresh shrimp showed a 10.8 drop because of a delay in the
reproductive cycle of white shrimp, while fish meal and fish oil
exports dropped by 52.7 percent and 63.5 percent respectively,
because of a reduction in the capture of anchovies and herring.
</P>
<P>
Green coffee exports also diminished by 43.4 percent as a
result of dropping prices in the international market.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, oil byproducts, which came third in exports,
witnessed a growth of 33.7 percent, and raw sugar posted a 25.7
percent increase.

KATHMANDU, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Britain's leading airline is
considering the possibility of operating passenger flights to
Nepal in the future.
</P>
<P>
General Manager of the British Airways Kevin Steele said the
airline would extend its current London-Delhi route to Kathmandu
if it could overcome technical aspects, obtain India's permission
and guarantee a profit, the official daily paper the Rising Nepal
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The British Airways, which is holding its South Asia regional
management meeting here over the weekend, has been conducting a
process of evaluating possible operations in Kathmandu since last
August, Steele said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Kathmandu, the capital city of Nepal, is a
destination with commercial potential as the government here has
launched the Visit Nepal Year 1998 program aimed at attracting
foreign tourists and the German airline Lufthansa stopped its
Kathmandu flights this year due to poor financial performance.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government has already allowed the British Airways
to operate passenger flights between Kathmandu and Delhi, and the
airline now needs permission from the Indian authorities, the
general manager said.
</P>
<P>
The British Airways' next round of talks with the Indian
government on the issue of traffic rights between Kathmandu and
Delhi will be held in May this year, he added.

<HEADLINE> French President Hails Bolivia's Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LA PAZ, March 15 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques
Chirac today hailed the reforms being implemented in Bolivia,
saying that "France is on the side" of that South American country.
</P>
<P>
"Bolivia has taken the right road and France is on its side,"
Chirac said in a speech at the Bolivian parliament building.
</P>
<P>
He said the reforms in Bolivia encourage France to support
Bolivia in the European Union, in the Group of Seven, and in the
multilateral institutions.
</P>
<P>
The South American country, which has transformed its political
system and started justice reforms, has opened itself and has
achieved spectacular changes, said the French president.
</P>
<P>
Chirac arrived in Bolivia Friday after a visit to Uruguay as
part of an eight-day tour of five South American countries.
</P>
<P>
He said Bolivia is fully qualified to be close to the Southern
Common Market (Mercosur), which groups Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay
and Paraguay, at a time when the European Union (EU) and Mercosur
have started to diversify and reinforce their links.
</P>
<P>
The EU and Mercosur signed a landmark cooperation agreement in
December 1995 designed to pave the way for a trans-Atlantic free
trade accord. Chile and Bolivia have signed on as associates of
the regional trade bloc.
</P>
<P>
The French president stressed the importance of combating drugs
as an absolute priority for the Bolivian government.
</P>
<P>
He said he has proposed to the European Union Commission that
the system of custom tariff exemptions be extended to products
that will substitute drug-producing plants and that Europe give
special assistance to Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
The European Union and Mercosur have agreed to try to reach a
free trade accord in two stages ending in 2005.

<HEADLINE> North Chinese Areas Making Joint Foreign Trade Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The municipalities of
Beijing and Tianjin are making a concerted effort with Hebei
Province to form a tripartite export-oriented economy.
</P>
<P>
The three parties have been making a joint effort to establish
an economic center in north China, and the annual Tianjin Foreign
Trade Export Fair is a direct result of this cooperation. In the
past, the three formed an economic union for foreign trade via
Tianjin port. Then they decided to go their own ways but the
results were no better.
</P>
<P>
The three have now agreed to share foreign trade bureaus abroad
to open up world markets and make fuller use of Tianjin port, and
Hebei Province is ready to take steps to stabilize prices of farm
produce and by-products needed by the two cities for export.
</P>
<P>
Another example is the famous Tianjin Ya Pear and the Jingdong
Chinese Chestnut, which come mostly from Hebei, but the three have
equal export rights to them.
</P>
<P>
The Tianjin Bonded Zone and its favourable policies are wide
open to Beijing and Hebei for developing foreign trade, setting up
new projects, and bonded business.
</P>
<P>
The united efforts are bringing good results. Finished
industrial products account for 71.5 percent of the total exports
and the product mix has been improved considerably. Cooperation
has helped the sustained development of foreign exports. Hebei
alone had 3.47 billion US dollars in exports in 1996, a 13.5
percent increase, higher than the country's average. enditem

<HEADLINE> China to Reform Debt Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The State Administration of
Foreign Exchange (SAFE) is considering setting different ceilings
for outstanding foreign debts of designated foreign exchange banks
and non-banking financial institutions with foreign borrowing
rights, according to today's Business Weekly of China Daily.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the financial institutions will be able
to make their own decisions in adjusting their debt structure as
long as they keep their long and medium-term foreign debts within
the ceiling and meet the central's bank's required
assets-liabilities ratio.
</P>
<P>
The reform is aimed at helping financial institutions reduce
debt risks and use foreign funds more efficiently, it quoted a
SAFE official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The official said most financial institutions seemed to welcome
the reform. The administration is expected to finish drafting a
reform plan this year but the implementation date can't be set
until the State Council approves the plan.
</P>
<P>
The long and medium-term foreign debts refer to foreign loans,
leasing and overseas bonds with at least one-year terms.
</P>
<P>
The state is adopting project management systems for those
kinds of debts. The State Planning Commission sets foreign debt
quotas for large construction projects that rely on financial
institutions for foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
Under the existing system, the financial institutions fail to
select the best interest rate and term for foreign borrowing
according to market changes, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Since the foreign debt quotas are valid within certain periods,
financial institutions sometimes have to borrow money to avoid
wasting quotas although market conditions aren't favorable.
</P>
<P>
"Our foreign debt management should go to the market and give
some autonomy to financial institutions," the official said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the State Council, or China's cabinet, started the
reform experiment in 1992 by giving autonomy to China
International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC).
</P>
<P>
CITIC was empowered to borrow overseas without prior approval
as long as its outstanding foreign debt was kept below the ceiling
during the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995). Its foreign debt
dropped from 2.5 billion US dollars in 1992 to last year's 2.3
billion.
</P>
<P>
The government last year extended CITIC's autonomy another five
years.

BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The renminbi yuan closed down at
8.2955 against the US dollar on February 28, slightly down
compared with 8.2925 on February 3, the month's first trading day,
according to today's Business Weekly of China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The yuan was bullish before the Chinese Lunar New Year that
fell on February 7, scoring a 20-month high closing price of
8.2918 against the US dollar a day before the festival.
</P>
<P>
A Bank of China dealer attributed the rise to a huge demand
for the renminbi as the festival approached, and reduced
intervention from the People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
But the yuan fell to 8.295 against the US dollar on February
12, the first trading day after the festival holidays.
</P>
<P>
Despite the small devaluation last month, analysts said the
yuan would remain stable thanks to China's sufficient foreign
exchange reserves, and a strong foreign trade performance with
rising exports and the declining inflation.  enditem

HANGZHOU, March 16 (Xinhua) -- A science park marking the
intersection of 120 degrees east longitude and 30 degrees north
latitude is being built in Dayuan Town, east China's Zhejiang
Province.
</P>
<P>
According to geography experts, there are 12 total cross points
of longitude and latitude lines in China, 11 of which are located
in untraversed sea, forest or desert areas.
</P>
<P>
Only the spot at the foot of a mountain in Dayuan Town has
favorable transportation conditions.
</P>
<P>
A tower will be built in the park at the exact point of
intersection. At noon, sunlight will be able to shine through the
passage. In addition, miniature replicas of some symbolic
geographical wonders around the world will be constructed.
</P>
<P>
Total cost of the park stands at 20 million yuan (2.4 million
US dollars),
</P>
<P>
Experts say 120 degree east longitude is the standard line of
Beijing Time. When the sun shines on the line at noon, most places
along the line report 12:00 Beijing Time. However, Beijing proper
has to wait another 16 minutes for noon to arrive.
</P>
<P>
The 30 degree north latitude line has some famous connections,
cutting through five well-known areas, including the Bermuda
Islands, the heaven for dinosaurs 200 million years ago, the
birthplaces of the world's three major religions, and places which
have undergone extensive crust activities.

Also along the line are world-famous tides, and Egyptian
pyramids and sphinx.

BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- It's essential that the public be
aware about environmental issues, stressed Wang Zhibao, Chinese

</P>
<P>
The official said that significant improvements will only be
achieved when the whole society understands the importance of

<P>
"Conservation awareness should start in primary schooling,"
Wang said, "we will make efforts to cooperate with other

"Even though consciousness about environmental concerns has
been raised, the understanding that to protect nature is to
protect the future of humanity has not been explained to many

Wang noted that the fact that journalists and teachers tend to
be more aware of the importance of protecting natural resources
will help China realize wider understanding of ecological concerns
at all levels of society.

<P>
"Not only the implementation of the Dayton agreement is now in
question, but the peace too," Silajdzic said.
</P>
<P>
Silajdzic and other Muslim leaders have argued that RS has no
authority to sign such an agreement with a foreign country since
it is only one of the two entities of Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Tibet's Efforts in Building Infrastructures Pay Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- With financial and technological
assistance from the central government and other parts of the
country, southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region has made
remarkable achievements in its infrastructure buildup.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the state has invested some
13.1 billion yuan in the fixed assets of Tibet, with 11.43 billion
yuan earmarked for the infrastructure. In 1997, over 2.9 billion
yuan will go to the sector.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the region's electricity-generating capacity stands
at 200,000 kw, with a yearly generation of 545 million kwh,
according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Tibet has rebuilt its highway that connects
with Nepal, and repaired all bridges on the Chinese section of the
international road. Meanwhile, new technology has been adopted to
improve the Qinghai-Tibet and Sichuan-Tibet highways so as to
reduce the losses caused by natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
The efforts to develop the telecommunications sector have been
successful, as all Tibetan counties have installed programmable
telephones and 97 percent of the counties have entered the
national automatic long-distance telephone switching networks.
</P>
<P>
A 900 mw cellular phone network has been put into operation,
while paging systems have been opened in six prefectures and
cities.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, a large number of water conservancy
projects, including reservoirs and other facilities for irrigation
and electricity generation, have been built in the region, which
have contributed much to the large increase in local agricultural
production.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, central government departments and other
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities have assisted
Tibet in constructing 62 projects, with a total investment of 3.7
billion yuan. So far, 56 of the 62 projects have been completed.
</P>
<P>
Tibet has also launched its own key projects in the mining
industry involving gold, iron and coal.
</P>
<P>
The region stepped up its efforts last year to introduce more
funds from other places of the country, especially the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
As a major beneficiary of the Glory Program, a nationwide
activity initiated by private businessmen in the country to help
poor areas, Tibet has reached agreements with Glory participants
for 53 projects involving a total investment amounting to 600
million yuan. 26 Glory projects are now under construction.

<HEADLINE> Petito Retains Lead in Cycling Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Italy's Roberto Petito retained the
overall lead in the Tirreno-Adriatico cycling race after the third
stage on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 213-kilometer stage from the Abruzzi mountain town of
Pescasseroli to Narni was won by Italian Michele Bartoli in the
same time as seven others, including fourth-placed Petito.
</P>
<P>
But bonus seconds picked up by riders complicated the
standings, with Italian Gianluca Pianegonda gaining two seconds to
level with Petito in the overall standings with an accumulated
time of 13 hours 14 minutes and 31 seconds.
</P>
<P>
After going back to Wednesday's opening time trial in Sorrento,
where times were measured in hundredths of a second, Petito was
found to be 0.14 ahead of his rival.
</P>
<P>
The pack arrived in Narni almost all together after various
attempts at breakaways had failed during the day.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's fourth stage is 123-km to Terni.

<HEADLINE> North China's Animal Husbandry Becoming Leading Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Animal husbandry in north
China's Hebei Province is contributing more to agricultural
development and farmers' pockets, and had an output value of 23
billion yuan last year, accounting for 35 percent of the total
agricultural output.
</P>
<P>
Animal husbandry is no longer a cottage industry but an
independent one and a driving force in developing the rural
economy and in improving the province's industrial structure
adjustment.
</P>
<P>
In some places, farmers are relying more heavily on animal
husbandry for profits. In Dachang county, one third of the
farmers' income comes from animal husbandry, making the county
fourth in the province in per capita income.
</P>
<P>
The province produced 3.4 million tons of meat last year,
making it fifth in the country, as well as 2.5 million tons of
eggs and 450,000 tons of fresh milk, second and fourth of all the
provinces, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Farmers have changed their traditional methods of raising pigs
for meat and chickens for the Spring Festival, and 1,100 animal
breeding villages, involving 600,000 specialized households, have
appeared.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 percent of the farmers in Dachang county are
engaged in activities related to breeding, processing, and
marketing of animals. The county's output value from cattle and
sheep last year exceeded 300 million yuan, making it a major
source of local revenue.
</P>
<P>
The province has set up over 90 livestock product bases that
support 50 leading enterprises. The Sanlu Dairy Company has a more
than 20 percent share of China's dairy products market, and has 59
dairy farms and 1,200 households with milk cows as suppliers.

<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital city will
spend more than 20 billion yuan on urban renewal, changing the
face of Beijing by the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The city will pull down more than five million square meters of
condemned houses and relocate 120,000 to 150,000 households in the

</P>
<P>
Former residents are encouraged to live in the suburbs while
construction takes place.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Capital Fruitful in Labor Export in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital city chalked
up substantial achievements in labor exports in 1996, signing
contracts worth 880 million US dollars and realizing 450 million
US dollars in business, and sending 4,500 workers abroad.
</P>
<P>
The information was released by Sun Anming, Vice-Director of
the Municipal Foreign Economic and Trade Commission of Beijing,
who spoke at a recent work conference of the city on the issue.
</P>
<P>
According to Sun, the Beijing Urban Construction Corporation
won the bid for a subway project in Tehran, which has a
contractual value of 153 million US dollars and now ranks as the
largest labor contract for a local firm in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Also last year, the Beijing International Economic Cooperation
clinched a deal for an irrigation project in Pakistan worth 26.7
million US dollars. Meanwhile, the Beijing Residential House
Construction Corporation sealed a labor export contract in
Singapore and signed two more contracts valued at 51.13 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition to consolidating the older markets in Southeast
Asia and West Asia, local labor exporters have opened some new
markets, including those in Israel and Sri Lanka, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
According to Yi Xiqun, director of the commission who also
spoke at the meeting, the city government last year took steps to
coordinate all concerned departments and industries so as to bring
the city's advantages in technology, personnel, funds, designing
and engineering into full play.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Sun noted, the city plans to sign labor export
contracts worth one billion US dollars, realize 500 million US
dollars in business and export 4,500 workers.
</P>
<P>
This year, the city government will organize 11 local labor
exporters to participate in two fairs involving Beijing's
international economic and technological cooperation, to be held
in Singapore and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more local companies will be granted rights to
export labors and undertake imports and exports, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the director, Beijing leads the country in labor
exports.

<HEADLINE> Wuhan to Open Wider to Outside World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Wuhan, capital of central China's
Hubei Province, plans to open wider to the outside world and
accelerate the development of its export-oriented economy this
year, Mayor Wang Shouhai said.
</P>
<P>
The city will focus on improving the investment environment and
attracting investments from both home and overseas, Wang said,
adding that funding from both consortia or small firms is welcome,
as are capital- and technology-intensive projects.
</P>
<P>
This year, the city aims to use 930 million US dollars of
foreign investment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan has adopted a series of measures in recent years to
improve its investment environment. In 1996, the city passed a
regulation governing the collection of fees from foreign-backed
companies. Fee rates were publicized and unnecessary fees were
eliminated. Complaint centers for foreign businessmen also were
set up.
</P>
<P>
"The regulations were welcomed by foreign investors," the mayor
said.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan has also taken a step forward in infrastructure
construction: work on the Yangtze Baishazhou Bridge will soon
start, and an environmental project to deal with pollution, funded
by World Bank in loans, has been launched. Repair of the Zhongnan
highway and the expansion of a waterworks have been completed.
</P>
<P>
Development of posts and telecommunications has progressed,
Wang said. The Tianhe Postal Transit Center has opened and will
provide local telephone service to one million people.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan, located along the mid-stream of the Yangtze River, will
also speed up the building of five-star hotels and take steps to
open the Tianhe Airport to international flights.
</P>
<P>
Wang went on to say that the city will push the reforms of
foreign trade firms, increase technological trade and service
trade, and adopt an export agent system, so that earnings from
exports can increase 11.9 percent to reach 900 million US
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Primakov, Albright hold talks for Helsinki Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
held talks on Saturday for preparation of Helsinki summit between
Soviet President Boris Yeltsin and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking forward to having a good meeting," Albright
said as she welcomed Primakov to her office. The Russian foreign
minister arrived in Washington this afternoon and then detoured to
the Russian embassy before meeting with Albright.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of Primakov's talks in Washington with U.S.
leaders, including Defense Secretary Williams Cohen on Sunday and
President Bill Clinton on Monday, is to try to find guidelines for
a new round of U.S. and Russian arms control and to narrow
differences on NATO enlargement.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and his government has been opposed to NATO's plan to
invite former member states of the Warsaw Pact when NATO hold a
summit in Madrid in July and to deployment of conventional weapons
to the territory of Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin registered his objections again on Friday to the NATO
enlargement, saying, "What the Americans are proposing -- moving
conventional weapons to the territory of Eastern Europe -- would
amount to a 'cordon sanitaire'. We won't go along with that."
</P>
<P>
But the United States ruled out any limits on the NATO
enlargement or the weapons that new members could bring into the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
While the United States has offered several concessions to
counter Russia's objections to NATO enlargement, it would not
negotiate limits on the new members.
</P>
<P>
the United States, trying to placate Russia, has proposed a
charter, defining Russia's ties with the Western alliance,
including granting Russia full membership in the G-7 Group
</P>
<P>
Another issue on the agenda during Primakov's talks with U.S.
leaders is to produce guidelines for reducing their nuclear
weapons arsenals beyond the sharp cut provided by the 1993 START
II treaty.
</P>
<P>
The Russian parliament is baling at ratifying the START II
treaty as it would strip Russia of its most potent long-range
warheads and the Russian economy cannot afford to build-up
single-warhead missiles.
</P>
<P>
Since there is no progress made on the issue of START II on the
side of Russia, there is no movement on proposed follow-on START
III reductions.

<HEADLINE> Von Gruenigen Wins World Cup Giant Slalom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Michael von Gruenigen of
Switzerland and Italy's Deborah Compagnoni extended their
season-long dominance of the event while Kjetil Andre Aamodt saw
his chances for the overall title virtually vanish at the World
Cup Finals at Vail, Colorado, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Von Gruenigen and Compagnoni won their giant-slalom races in
the World Cup Finals, each coming from second place to overtake
the first-run leader.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old von Gruenigen, who also won the world
championship title this year, was second by 0.18 of a second after
the first run, finished with a combined time of two minutes, 18.58
seconds.
</P>
<P>
Salzgeber was second in 2:19.57, with compatriot Andreas
Schifferer, winner of Thursday's super-giant slalom race, taking
third place in 2:19.97.
</P>
<P>
Compagnoni, who earlier clinched the season giant-slalom title
and won the event in the World Championship, posted her fourth
straight victory in seven giant slalom races this season.
</P>
<P>
Compagnoni, 0.17 seconds behind first-run leader Katja
Seizinger, overtook Seizinger with a second run that was 0.55
seconds quicker than the German's. She finished with a combined
time of 2:11.45.
</P>
<P>
Aamodt, second best in the giant slalom standings, earned 36
points for his finish, a result that probably scuttled his chances
of overtaking France's Luc Alphand for the overall title.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian, who won the World Cup title in 1994, now trails
Alphand by 70 points with only Sunday's slalom remaining to the
season.
</P>
<P>
Aamodt, who ranks only eighth in the slalom standings, needs to
win or finish second on Sunday to pass Alphand, who is poised to
become the first Frenchman since Jean-Claude Killy in 1968 to win
the overall crown.
</P>
<P>
Aamodt's best slalom finish this season was third in the
season-opening slalom in Park City. In his last three slaloms, the
Norwegian has finished 10th, 11th and 15th.

<HEADLINE> North China Replaces South as Grain-Supplying Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- China's decades-long system of
transporting grain from the southern part of the country to the
north has undergone a fundamental change, according to a report by
the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the crop-growing capability in north China has
increased, while in south China, especially the coastal areas in
the southeast, it has decreased. To maintain the national balance
of grain supplies, large quantities of grain produced in the north
have been transported from there southward.
</P>
<P>
From 1983 to 1995, China's year-on-year increase of grain
output totalled 79.34 million tons. Of the total, north China made
up 70 percent, while the south accounted for 30 percent,
Shanghai-based Xinmin Evening News reported.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta have taken the
lead in shifting from grain exporting to importing.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, 10 of the 16 southern China provinces and regions were
short of grain, with the shortfall amounting to 25 million tons.

<HEADLINE> EU to Offer Big Money to Help Angola's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will
provide 167 million European Currency Units (ECU) in 1997, up 45
percent over 1996, to help Angola undertake post-war
socio-economic reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Gaspar Cardoso, a senior official in the Angolan Ministry for
Planning, said today that a related accord will be signed when
the Angolan government and the EU finish their current
negotiations on the details of how to use the money.
</P>
<P>
The EU money will be mainly used in repairing war-damaged
roads and reconstructing and developing cities in the
southern African country, said Cardoso.
</P>
<P>
The EU assistance aims at facilitating Angola's economic
reforms, increasing domestic production, developing the private
sector and creating job opportunities, he added.
</P>
<P>
The EU has offered about 580 million ECU to Angola since it
opened an office in the country in 1986. Among the money 82
million were used in developing projects and 78 million in
restoring infrastructures, he added. enditem
