KNICKS BEAT MAVERICKS, 100-93 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Under the pressure of the moment, Allan Houston
revealed an unshakably smooth release with the Dallas Mavericks'
Michael Finley right in his whiskers down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Houston scored 31 points, including 8 on four consecutive
baseline jumpers in the last three and a half minutes of the game,
to give the Knicks a 100-93 triumph at Reunion Arena on Thursday
night and their fifth straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   As explosive as Houston was on offense, his energetic sidekick
on defense was Marcus Camby. He earned every one of his 34 minutes
by scoring 17 points, blocking 5 shots and grabbing 13 rebounds. In
the process, he took the burden off a languid Patrick Ewing, who
finished with 14 points and seemed a step behind most of the game.
</P>
<P>
   After three blocks in two minutes by Camby, topped off with a
3-pointer at the shot-clock buzzer by Latrell Sprewell, the Knicks
looked as if they were on their way to an easy finish to their
brief western swing. But the Mavs made a furious push in the end
with the help of some big rebounds to go on an 8-0 run and cut the
Knicks' lead to 86-84. That was when Houston turned on his touch
and hit four straight jumpers, three of which came over the tight
defense of Finley, who scored 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks won despite a 1-for-10 night from Larry Johnson and
just 15 points by Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing was part of a first unit that was too lethargic in the
first quarter to keep up with the frenetic pace the Mavericks
established from the opening tip. It took the instant energy
provided by Camby and Chris Childs off the bench to keep the Knicks
in the game and tied with the Mavs at halftime, 43-43.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off his frisky performance in Houston on Tuesday, a flat
Ewing sat out most of the first half. After seven minutes of
watching Gary Trent spin by him in the lane, after seeing Ewing too
late to jump out on the perimeter and defend Dirk Nowitzki's
jumpers, Coach Jeff Van Gundy took him out and put Camby in.
</P>
<P>
   Camby never left the floor again in the first half. While
Sprewell was unable to stop Finley's fall-away jumpers and the
7-foot-6-inch Shawn Bradley was busy swatting Johnson's layups to
leave the Knicks' low-post threat 0 for 9 in the first half, Camby
and Houston were the only ones left to save the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Camby's feisty attitude was contagious. He was the catalyst to
the Knicks' second-quarter comeback. After the Knicks had fallen
behind by 31-20 with 9 minutes 52 seconds left in the half, Camby
became the focus of the offense as he scored 11 points in three
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Childs, relieving a slow-footed Charlie Ward who could not keep
up with the driving Robert Pack, found Camby cutting to the basket
for layups. Camby had three consecutive driving layups as a part of
his offensive flurry in the second quarter that left him with 13
first-half points to go with 7 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   This was the best Camby had looked in more than a week. Over the
past seven days, he had wondered aloud about the minutes crunch
that would result from Ewing's return. And when Camby had been on
the floor, he had been in foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, Camby was earning a long stay on the court.
Van Gundy did not let his loyalties to Ewing stop him from leaving
Camby in for 17 first-half minutes. With one minute to go in the
second quarter, Ewing approached the scorer's table to check into
the game. As the clock wound down on the half, Ewing retreated to
the bench with 7 minutes, 2 points and 3 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing's demeanor in the second half was a little more lively, as
was the body language of his teammates _ especially Sprewell. After
a pump fake that left Hubert Davis reaching for air, Sprewell flew
through the lane and put down an emphatic dunk to give the Knicks a
58-55 lead with 6:27 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   With the Knicks clicking, Ewing was left in the game and Camby
came in for Johnson. Camby made his mark, grabbing an alley-oop
pass from Ward and coming away with a dunk to give the Knicks a
7-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   But for every flashy moment the Knicks unearthed, they made a
mistake. A flagrant foul by Johnson, who whacked Pack on the way to
a dunk, led to a 3-point possession for the Mavs. And a turnover by
Ward in the backcourt gave Dallas an easy layup to cut the lead to
71-68 with just under two minutes to play in the third quarter. The
Knicks, who converted a nice last-second fast break when Camby
found Johnson alone under the basket for a layup, led after the
period, 75-70.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing played the whole third quarter and looked much better. He
scored 8 points and was a contributor side by side with Camby.

 MAN CALLED PHILADELPHIA CRIME CHIEF INDICTED WITH 13 OTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph Merlino, identified by prosecutors as the head of the
principal organized-crime family in Philadelphia, has been indicted
on federal charges of running a fencing operation that sold
bicycles, baby formula and other goods stolen from a waterfront
shipping port.
</P>
<P>
   Merlino, 37, was charged with 13 other men in two separate but
related indictments announced Thursday by the U.S. attorney's
office in Philadelphia. The indictments were handed up by a grand
jury there on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Merlino, who is known as Skinny Joey and has homes in
Philadelphia and Margate, N.J., was arrested in June and has been
in custody since then on federal cocaine-distribution charges that
were repeated in Wednesday's superseding indictment, said Barry
Gross, an assistant U.S. attorney. The others were freed on bail in
amounts ranging up to $100,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Merlino was being held Thursday in a federal prison in Fairfield
Township, N.J., said his lawyer, Joseph Santaguida. Santaguida
declined to comment on the new charges, which were brought under
the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.
</P>
<P>
   As for the cocaine charges, he said, ``Joey never had anything
to do with drugs, and they were totally against drugs.'' Asked who
``they'' were, Santaguida said, ``Joey and his friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Between July 1997 and August 1998, Gross said, Merlino and four
other members of his crime family, La Cosa Nostra, received
$405,871 worth of goods that had been stolen from a CSX freight
yard and Ameriport container shipping port in Philadelphia. The
other men, all of Philadelphia, were identified as Frank Gambino,
68; Ralph Abbruzzi, 50, also known as Ralphie Head; Steven
Frangipani, 37, also known as Snitch, and Anthony Accardo, 39.
</P>
<P>
   Gross said the goods were stolen by nine other men, including
several who are involved in the trucking industry and one who was a
CSX security guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``They started with a shipment of ceiling fans in July 1997,''
Gross said. They were accused of receiving 13,000 women's
sweatsuits, a container of bicycles and a container of baby formula
and nutritional supplements. He refused to say where the goods were
sold.
</P>
<P>
   The nine men not identified as members of La Cosa Nostra are
accused of stealing more than $1.3 million worth of goods from the
port.
</P>
<P>
   Jake Griffin, a lawyer for one of the men, Wesley DiDomenicis,
38, of Voorhees, N.J., the president of BMX Trucking Co. in
Philadelphia, declined to comment on the charges.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Merlino was acquitted of threatening a federal agent
during his arrest in June, and Santaguida said the latest set of
charges was no more likely to stick. ``Joey is used to that,'' he
said. ``Any crime anyone commits, they always say, `He's behind
it,' or, `He orchestrated it,' or, `It wouldn't have happened if
they didn't get his OK.'''

   LOS ANGELES _ The Clippers, who have no reference point for the
concept of livin' large, have another big problem:
</P>
<P>
   They're livin' even smaller than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Tuesday's Laker catastrophe has become the exclusive
province of talk radio, the prevailing dilemma was the challenge
created by back-to-back ankle injuries for Derek Anderson and Brian
Skinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The walking wounded don't look good,'' Coach Chris Ford said
of the 6-foot-5 Anderson and the 6-9 Skinner, whose wounds make
walking require crutches. They are expected to be goners for two
weeks. ``Both of their ankles are still swollen.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson rolled his ankle in the first quarter of Monday's
victory over Vancouver. Skinner did his damage in the opening
quarter versus the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   This means 10 relatively able-bodied Clippers will suit up
tonight against the Golden State Warriors at Staples Center. It
also means 7-3 Keith Closs, who has been so far down the bench that
he makes a beeping nose while backing up, will be the first big guy
off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is his opportunity,'' Ford said of Closs.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative would be hiring a temp from the CBA, but Elgin
Baylor, the team's vice president of basketball ops, said the minor
league is not exactly a bonanza of tall hoop talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they were that good,'' Baylor pointed out, ``they wouldn't
be in the CBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford, for now, prefers to go with the Terrific 10, but doesn't
eliminate the possibility of adding a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible that we may bring one body in,'' said Ford,
leaving us to assume it would be a body with a pulse. ``Unless it
was a trade, anyone we bring in would not leapfrog over anyone we
already have.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast breaks: Lamar Odom's sore hip didn't prevent the rookie
forward from participating in Thursday's practice, but he did
request a leave of absence from posting up during a controlled
scrimmage. ``He's gotta get healthy and he's gotta knock down some
shots,'' Ford said of Odom, who scored just 8 points against the
Pacers and Grizzlies and just 2 vs. the Lakers. ``Other teams have
scouted him. They're not letting him beat them off the dribble; he
has to make them pay by taking the shots they're giving him.'' ...
Golden State went into Thursday night's game with Detroit just 1/2
game ahead of the Clippers (5-17) in the struggle to escape the
Pacific Division cellar. The Warriors defeated the Miami Heat
Tuesday in Oakland. ... The Clippers have promoted Rob Raichlen to
the rank of Director of Communications. Raichlen replaces Jill
Wiggins, who took a similar job with Portland's new WNBA franchise.

NETS FALL TO WIZARDS, 108-104 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The night started so well for the New Jersey Nets.
They drained 3-pointers like layups, had a 7-point halftime lead
over the Washington Wizards and received praise from President
Clinton, who attended the game as a guest of Lewis Katz, the Nets'
principal owner.
</P>
<P>
   But a fourth-quarter collapse, which almost mirrored the Nets'
performance against the Wizards two weeks ago, turned an enchanted
evening into just another hellish experience for the mystifying
team with the see-saw play.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring only two field goals in the final six minutes, being
outrebounded by 41-28 and allowing the Wizards to shoot 59.5
percent from the field, the Nets lost, 108-104.
</P>
<P>
   With the loss, they dropped to 6-17, and, after a one-game
hiatus, back into the Atlantic Division cellar.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, who led by 9 points early in the fourth, were
outscored by 32-24 in the final period and victimized by a
game-turning 19-6 run that saw the Wizards surge from a 7-point
deficit to a 6-point lead, 105-99, with 52.8 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's charge included some baffling miscues by the Nets,
including the two times when Jamie Feick was stripped of the ball
after grabbing defensive rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, who shot 53.7 percent through three quarters but only
42.1 percent in the fourth, moved within 105-104 on a 3-point play
by Stephon Marbury with 15.6 seconds left, and had a chance to tie
the score in the final moments.
</P>
<P>
   Down by 2 points after Rod Strickland made one of two foul shots
with 13.8 seconds left, the Nets called a timeout and decided to go
to Kerry Kittles, despite the fact that he had scored only 2 of his
12 points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Kittles got open on the left wing and flew past the Wizards'
defense along the baseline and threw up an off-balance reverse
layup that hit the backboard but missed the rim.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Van Horn, who led the Nets with 23 points, fouled Juwan
Howard while going for the rebound, and Howard's ensuing two free
throws sealed the outcome for the Wizards, who won for only the
second time in their last nine games to improve to 7-17.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wide open when I got the ball,'' Kittles said. ``It was
just a bad shot. I didn't feel comfortable while shooting it. The
play happened so quickly that I can't tell you what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets' late-game crumble was reminiscent of their 85-78 loss
to Washington on Nov. 30, when they gave away a 15-point
third-quarter lead by being outscored, 26-11, in the final quarter.
Coach Don Casey compared the game with the Nets' 71-69 loss to the
woeful Chicago Bulls last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's similar to Chicago in that Washington made the big plays
and we floundered at the end,'' Casey said. ``We were like lost
souls out there. A lot of teams are having career nights against
us. We're resurrecting careers.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey was referring to the stat line of Washington's center,
Jahidi White, who scored a career-high 19 points and grabbed 8
rebounds in the first start of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Howard, who has been having a poor season, led everyone with a
season-high 28 points, 15 above his average, and Mitch Richmond,
who has also struggled this season, scored 22. Strickland added 17
points and 14 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their strong shooting in the first three quarters,
which included an awesome 9-of-11 3-point shooting effort in the
first half, the Nets shot 50.7 percent. Marbury followed Van Horn
with 20 points and 11 assists, while Kendall Gill hit three
3-pointers in scoring 19 points and making 4 steals. The Nets'
finished 11 of 20 from 3-point range. Their early 3-point barrage
left the president lauding them at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're playing well tonight, very impressive,'' said the
president, who sat with Katz in a lower-level loge. ``They have a
lot of talent.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the Nets looked to be headed for their fifth
victory in six games. They were winning what looked like a
1970's-style shootout in the first half. Washington was unconscious
in the first quarter, making an incredible 78.9 percent (15 of 19)
of its field-goal attempts. Such hot shooting would typically be
the beginning of a blowout, but the Nets were nearly as accurate,
shooting 63.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Five players connected from long range in the quarter as the
Nets made their first 6-of-7 3-point attempts in the first quarter.
Marbury, Gill and Kittles each canned triples in the first three
minutes to build an early lead, and the Nets went on to hit their
next three before finally missing.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when the Nets took their 59-52 lead into the locker room,
the president and everyone else was impressed. Of course, even the
most powerful man in the world could not forsee how badly the Nets
would fold.

 By JANE GROSS

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Don't offer Peter Jennings a cup of coffee anytime in
the next two weeks. He is abstaining, on doctor's orders, so a
sudden surge of caffeine will really pack a wallop on Dec. 31, when
he'll be on the air, virtually nonstop, for 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings will anchor ABC's all-millennium, all-the-time
broadcast, from 5 a.m. on the last day of the old year until 5 a.m.
on the first day of the new. Fittingly, he will broadcast from the
network's new studio in Times Square, ground zero for the world's
year 2000 celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings, 61, has not pulled an all-nighter in a very long time,
coming closest when he was on the air for 15 hours during the Gulf
War and 12 hours after the Challenger disaster. His daughter, a
college sophomore, has offered an array of remedies popular on
campus during exam week. He hopes Starbucks does the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings is not alone in looking for ways to keep from nodding
off somewhere between midnight in New Zealand and midnight in
Western Samoa. The executive director of ABC 2000, Roger Goodman,
has also sworn off coffee, and alcohol, until the big day. And he
plans to take a sleeping pill the night before to ensure a full
eight hours of rest and is considering a dose of Ritalin to stay
focused during the hectic broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ABC is promoting the broadcast as a historic undertaking _ the
First, the Biggest, the Best. Advertisements on bus shelters
trumpet ``24 Hours, 7 Continents, 1 Network.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing will ever compare to this,'' Goodman said with
unabashed hyperbole. ``I can't wait.''
</P>
<P>
   The staff in the War Room on West 66th Street, where the
broadcast is being planned, say the proof is in the numbers. There
will be 30 correspondents stationed around the globe, along with
225 producers, 485 engineers, 32 satellites, 72 tape machines, 80
ABC cameras, 400 more from a consortium of cooperating stations
worldwide and three backup control rooms (in case the main one at
1500 Broadway suffers year 2000 disruptions). More than 300 people
will work in the Times Square studio, napping in shifts on a dozen
cots, stoked by a catered buffet and rewarded for their efforts
with commemorative fleece jackets and fatter-than-average
paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   But a note of historical caution is in order, said Lawrence K.
Grossman, the former president of NBC News and PBS and author of
``The Electronic Republic.'' Grossman, who will spend a
television-free New Year's Eve at the New York Philharmonic,
applauds ABC for ``an enormous and awesome undertaking.'' Yet he
urges this generation of television journalists to see the 24-hour
broadcast in context.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you say which is more difficult or ambitious or a
greater achievement?'' Grossman asked, citing ``monster efforts''
of earlier decades, like the first live broadcast seen on both
coasts, the first live political convention, or the first satellite
broadcast, all of which set the stage for what is possible today.
</P>
<P>
   But the news division at ABC, a subsidiary of the Walt Disney
Co., is in no mood for modesty. At an all-hands meeting earlier
this week, David Westin, president of ABC News, reminded staff
members that the event could have fallen into the hands of the
entertainment division. ``It's a huge undertaking and we stepped
forward and said we wanted to own it,'' he said, sounding every bit
the football coach preparing his team for the big game.
</P>
<P>
   The corporate conference room was standing-room only, with
people pressed against the walls, perched on window sills and
seated cross-legged on the floor. Far-flung correspondents and
producers listened in by remote hook-up.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings stayed in the background during Westin's pep talk and
remained there while producers laid out the grueling timetable
between now and the big day: when taped segments would be screened,
when the ``Good Morning America'' set would be dismantled, when the
correspondents would be dispatched to their posts.
</P>
<P>
   Looming large was the story board, a patchwork of color-coded
segments, with every minute of every hour accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   Patches of red indicated live entertainment: Billy Joel, the
Kirov Ballet, Aretha Franklin, the Sydney Opera, Bonnie Raitt.
Orange was for segments prepared in advance: essays on subjects
like spirituality, science, sports and warfare. Purple represented
the hourly cascade of midnight celebrations. Gray was for local
news segments. Pink was for video feeds from the worldwide
consortium.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings scowled openly at the huge multicolored chart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks so scrunched, like the program is already done,''
Jennings complained. ``The great joy of this should be spontaneity.
You must push us to get something on that's not on the board. If
you have something great, I promise it will get on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the roomed buzzed with a more potent stimulant than
caffeine: the adrenaline rush of beating the competition, even when
the competition sits in the office next door.
</P>
<P>
   Because the story board was a mere backup plan, each
correspondent _ Barbara Walters in Paris, Cokie Roberts in Rome,
Charles Gibson in London, Morton Dean in Moscow, Lynn Sherr in
India, to name but a few _ was on notice to find moments of
celebration, reflection or suspense, get a producer on the phone
and sell their story hard enough to push someone else off.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings, to be sure, is not immune to the thrill of having his
face on the screen, his observations the viewers' road map. He says
he will not leave the anchor chair on New Year's Eve for more than
about 10 minutes at a stretch, during local news breaks, lest he
miss a news development requiring his signature commentary. That
means he will forgo showers and naps, freshening up with just a few
shirt changes.
</P>
<P>
   He says he will also leave the studio, with its bullet-proof
windows, to wander Times Square. ``I wouldn't want the century to
go by entirely on the other side of the glass,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The logistics of the 24-hour broadcast extend beyond uplinks and
down time. ABC also must see to the comfort of its staff, not just
pampered stars like Jennings but all the anonymous technicians and
gofers. The technical people will work two shifts of 12 hours each,
while the production team and Jennings will be on duty throughout.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of year 2000 disruptions or terrorist violence
went unmentioned at the staff meeting, and Jennings scoffed at the
notion that Times Square on New Year's Eve was a dangerous posting.
``We've been in worse places, like the Middle East,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also insisted that he had no stake in whether the broadcast
included dramatic breaking news _ a certain ratings bonanza. He
would be delighted, Jennings said, with an uninterrupted reflection
on where the world has been for the past 1,000 years and where it
is going.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not to say the network hasn't made elaborate plans
for any eventuality. The three backup control rooms _ one at
corporate headquarters on West 66th Street, one in Washington and
another in London _ will each have their own anchors ready to take
over for Jennings if he is forced off the air. And the New York
Police Department has promised a clear corridor to 66th Street if
the crew at Times Square needs to leave that studio.

   ``Every system has been checked,'' said Neil Patterson, the
executive in charge of production. ``Every chip has been looked at.
As redundant as we can be, we are. But if the satellites go down,
we'll all be sitting around drinking Champagne.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing left to chance is what Jennings will wear for the
occasion. Until 11:45 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, expect a sleek
coat and tie. But as midnight approaches in the city that
celebrates like no other, he may disappear for a costume change.
``I'm asking everybody's opinion,'' Jennings said. ``Do you think I
should wear a dinner jacket?''

   NEW YORK _ While Peter Jennings is announcing that the New Year
has arrived in Djibouti, anchors at the other networks will be
taking things a little easier.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 31, CBS' ``Early Show'' will be co-anchored from Sydney
and New York. Later, CBS's prime-time coverage will originate from
the entertainment division in Los Angeles, with news coverage
limited to the evening news and one-minute updates from numerous
correspondents after Dan Rather anchors the news.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's New Year's Eve coverage, like ABC's, will begin at 5 a.m.
There will be live hourly updates on New Year's observances and any
year 2000 developments. Tom Brokaw will be amply supplemented by
dozens of NBC reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Couric and Brokaw will anchor an expanded edition of
``Today,'' which will run in each United States time zone from 7
a.m. to 10 a.m. And Brokaw will anchor the evening news live from
Times Square beginning at 6:30 p.m. A special edition of
``Dateline'' _ on what Americans can expect from the next
millennium (apart, evidently, from endless news broadcasts) _ will
be shown from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. The network will continue to cover
any breaking news until 3:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC's live coverage will also continue for 30 hours, featuring
a team of computer and utility experts who will follow any year
2000 news.
</P>
<P>
   At the Fox network, the plans are more modest, with a 90-minute
special from 11 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. Brit Hume and Paula Zahn will
report live from Times Square, Tony Snow from the federal year 2000
center in Washington and John Walsh, of ``America's Most Wanted,''
from the command center in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast will also include taped celebrations from London,
Moscow, Bethlehem, Las Vegas and New Mexico and live concerts in
progress. Only in the event of a large-scale news development does
Fox intend to interrupt its regular programming earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   The makers of No-Doz ought to concentrate their marketing
efforts on the staff of CNN. CNN will offer continuous coverage
beginning at 5 a.m. on New Year's Eve, through Tuesday morning,
Jan. 4, with anchors from around the globe and reports from 60 CNN
correspondents, for a total of 100 hours of live programming.

CUBAN BOY AT CENTER OF ANOTHER DEBATE _ ON NEW YEAR'S PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (mk) 
 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The 6-year-old Cuban refugee whose fate has sparked
heated debate in Havana, Washington and Miami became the center of
yet more polemic Thursday when Mayor Rudolph Giuliani suggested
that the boy might be invited to attend the New Year's Eve
celebration in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   In a lengthy exchange with reporters at City Hall, Giuliani said
the question of whether the boy, Elian Gonzalez, should be returned
to Cuba _ as Fidel Castro and the boy's father have demanded _
``plays out in a very dramatic way the purpose of America.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy has been staying with relatives in Miami since he was
rescued last month off the Florida coast during an ill-fated voyage
from Cuba that took the lives of his mother and stepfather and nine
others.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Spencer Eig, a lawyer representing Elian, said that
the boy and his family had not received an official invitation.
``It is a kind and caring suggestion,'' he said, but he added that
the family had not decided whether Elian would participate.
``Midnight is kind of late for a 6-year-old,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The possible invitation was first reported Thursday by The Daily
News. In discussing it, Giuliani spoke about the boy's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``My views are that he should be given the benefit of asylum
protection, and whatever argument his father has should be made in
an American court,'' the mayor said. ``The very dramatic act of his
mother, in giving up her life in order to obtain freedom and
democracy for her child, is a very powerful thing.''

RUSH RULING NOT LIKELY TO COME SOON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Based on Pac-10 and NCAA precedent, suspended UCLA
forward JaRon Rush probably wouldn't lose his college eligibility
if his only NCAA violation was accepting several hundred dollars
from a Los Angeles sports agent.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rush is also being investigated for possible violations
resulting from his financial relationship with former AAU coach
Myron Piggie. The situation is complicated _ it involves the FBI
and IRS _ and could take weeks to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   The agent situation seems clear. According to sources close to
UCLA and Rush, he accepted between $200-300 from agent Jerome
Stanley _ a violation of the NCAA's extra-benefits rule that could
jeopardize his amateur status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, the athlete is immediately ruled ineligible,'' Pac-10
commissioner Tom Hansen said. ``The restoration process begins when
the student-athlete pays back the money received and loses a few
games.''
</P>
<P>
   If Rush agreed to future representation by Stanley _ either
orally or in writing _ the penalties probably would be severe.
</P>
<P>
   If it's only a matter of $200-300, history indicates Rush could
return this season:
</P>
<P>
   _In 1995, USC football player Shawn Walters accepted $16,000
from an agent. His eligibility was terminated, then returned on
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   _Cal basketball player Tremaine Fowlkes accepted $2,000 from an
agent to purchase a vehicle. He was ruled ineligible for one year,
but the penalty was reduced to 14 games on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   _UCLA football player Donnie Edwards accepted groceries valued
at $150. He was ineligible for one game.
</P>
<P>
   _Arizona basketball player Ben Davis accepted gifts valued at
$3,453 from a New York businessman who, a month later, became
Davis' agent. The infraction was discovered with one game remaining
in the regular season. Davis was ruled ineligible for that game and
the NCAA Tournament. (Arizona lost in the first round.)
</P>
<P>
   _Arizona football player Richard Dice was ineligible for one
game for making $17 in telephone calls on an agent's credit card.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say Rush is probably looking at five games or so because
of the thing with Stanley,'' a Pac-10 source said. ``But the Piggie
situation could complicate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley has denied any wrongdoing. Reached in his office
Thursday, he said: ``I want to talk to you. I've got to get out of
this mess. I'll call you back.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not.

RICHARDSON MEANS TROUBLE FOR UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ DePaul All-American forward Quentin Richardson
isn't suffering from the sophomore jinx so much as the sophomore
nag _ a series of nagging ailments that, until recently, have
limited his practice time and tempered his production.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, whose No.19 Blue Demons face UCLA on Saturday at
Pauley Pavilion, missed three practices last month because of an
ingrown toenail. Then, thinking he needed a filling replaced,
Richardson instead had a molar removed and missed more practice
time. Finally, he strained his shoulder lifting weights.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very bright kid, and he sees what's happening,'' DePaul
coach Pat Kennedy said. ``He didn't practice for three days before
the Duke game. But now he seems to be 100 percent. He's getting
himself back on course.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson averaged 17.9 points and 8.6 rebounds in the Blue
Demons' first eight games _ superb numbers for anyone but the
nation's top sophomore. But improved performance has accompanied
improved health. Tuesday, before two dozen NBA scouts, Richardson
had 26 points and 12 rebounds against St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he takes aim at UCLA, and the Bruins are bracing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to have a collective awareness of where he is,''
Bruins coach Steve Lavin said. ``He can beat you in so many ways.
That's why the pros think he's a top-five pick.''
</P>
<P>
   Prepping the defense: At 6-6 and 225 pounds, Richardson is a
difficult matchup _ too big for guards, too quick for forwards.
He's accurate from 3-point range, he can score off the dribble, and
he has an array of low-post moves.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore guard Ray Young is UCLA's best chance; he's strong and
athletic. But it's unrealistic for Young to defend Richardson
effectively for 30 minutes, avoid foul trouble and have much
success offensively. Most likely, guard Earl Watson and two
forwards, Rico Hines and Jason Kapono, will help Young.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Bruins probably will play zone defense to
protect their big men, Jerome Moiso and Dan Gadzuric, from foul
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``DePaul will be equally, if not more challenging than
Gonzaga,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: The Blue Demons (7-2) are without starting point
guard Rashon Bruno, who strained a knee ligament against St. John's
and will miss three to five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   His replacement is senior Kerry Hartfield.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting cast: DePaul's 7-foot freshman center, Steven Hunter,
has been as impressive as the Pac-10's best rookies _ Arizona's
Gilbert Arenas and Jason Gardner, Stanford's Casey Jacobsen, Cal's
Joe Shipp, and Kapono.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, who wasn't heavily recruited, is averaging 12.8 points
and scored 21 against Duke.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the degree he played in the Duke game, I think he has
surprised everyone,'' Kennedy said. ``He has NBA potential and
wasn't recruited at that level.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter is DePaul's No. 4 scorer, behind Richardson, forward
Bobby Simmons and guard Paul McPherson, a junior college transfer.

U.S. INDICTS MONEY MANAGER ON FRAUD AND KICKBACK CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS to change National Basketball Association to NBA Players'
Pension Fund in 7th graf.)

 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wall Street money manager Alan B. Bond was indicted
Thursday on charges he took $6.9 million in kickbacks from
commissions paid to brokers to whom he steered his clients'
investments.
</P>
<P>
   Bond runs his own investment company and is also a regular guest
on the PBS's television program, ``Wall Street Week with Louis
Rukeyser.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11-count indictment returned in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan charged Bond with conspiracy, investment advisory fraud,
commercial bribery, and making false statements to the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The government contends Bond, who is 38, had used three
brokerage firms to carry out his scheme from 1993 to 1998, having
them execute Nasdaq stock trades on behalf of his clients, then
taking kickbacks of 57 percent to 80 percent from commissions.
</P>
<P>
   A second man, Robert I. Spruill, a broker who worked at all
three brokerage firms, was charged Thursday with conspiracy and
fraud charges for his role in the scheme. The government contended
that he had set up a dummy corporation, called Satchmo Inc., which
was used to funnel commission kickbacks to Bond.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Bond could face five years in prison on each
count, said the office of Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in
Manhattan. The SEC, in a separate action, sued Bond, seeking
repayment of his gains and other civil penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The government contended Bond had concealed the scheme from the
clients he victimized, which included the National Basketball
Association Players' Pension Fund, the City University of New York
Investment Pool, and several city pension and retirement funds,
including the Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority Retirement
Plan Local 689, his largest client. In all, his firm managed about
$600 million for 25 clients, the authorities said. His firm's
strategy focused on growth securities.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment contended Bond had used the proceeds of his
crimes to ``maintain a lavish lifestyle.'' The authorities said
this included the refurbishing and decorating of his home, the
purchase of two vacation properties in Florida _ including a house
with a pool in Sarasota _ the purchase of 75 luxury and classic
automobiles, tickets to Broadway, and his Harvard Club dues.
</P>
<P>
   Bond, who lives in Montclair, N.J., has not yet been arraigned,
and he could not be reached by phone Thursday. His lawyer, John S.
Siffert, said his client would be entering a not guilty plea and
will be contesting the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect that he will be vindicated,'' Siffert added.
</P>
<P>
   Spruill was released on his own recognizance Thursday by U.S.
Magistrate Judge Frank Mass after entering a not guilty plea. His
lawyer, Frederick P. Schaffer, had no comment.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An SEC spokesman, Clifford C. Hyatt, said the investigation of
Bond began when the agency's examiners discovered irregularities in
the books of Lintz Glover White &AMP; Co., a small broker-dealer in
Sherman Oaks, Calif. The firm, one of the three Bond ultimately
used in his scheme, was ``running a high volume of trades for a New
York money manager,'' Hyatt said, and was receiving high
commissions.
</P>
<P>
   The trail led to an employee there, Spruill, and his use of the
dummy company to funnel money back to Bond. Bond was then president
and chief investment officer of Bond, Procope Capital Management in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Spruill, 52, of Newark, ultimately worked at each of the three
firms used in the scheme and ``played a critical role in
implementing Bond's advisory fraud,'' the SEC's lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   Bond also instructed the brokerage firms not to report the
commissions or mark-ups he established on the confirmation and
account statements sent to his clients, the SEC said.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Caproni, Pacific regional director of the SEC, said in a
statement: ``By choosing to direct trades to these firms, Bond was
not only deciding when he received a kickback, he was also deciding
how much the kickbacks would be, while at the same time, preventing
his clients from detecting the scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Although Bond's clients were mostly pension funds, the victims
are human,'' Caproni added, ``People who believed that their
pension fund adviser was investing for their benefit not his.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond was also accused of taking kickbacks by misappropriating
hundreds of thousands of dollars in ``soft dollar'' credits, which
belonged to his clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soft dollar'' credits are partial rebates of broker
commissions that may be paid back to investment advisers if they
are used on behalf of the client, such as for the purchase of
research reports or computer software. But Bond used this kickback
to pay his credit card bills and other personal expenses, the
government contended.
</P>
<P>
   The two other firms used by Bond were the Brenner Securities
Corp., a now defunct brokerage firm in New York, and Value
Investing Partners, of Westport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Bond, a 1987 graduate of Harvard Business School, was an
associate with Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. from 1987 to 1989, and a
portfolio manager for W.R. Lazard &AMP; Co. from 1989 to 1991, the SEC
suit said.
</P>
<P>
   He was president and chief executive of Bond, Procope from 1991
until late last year, when he bought out his partners, and
reconstituted the firm, now called Albriond Capital Management.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The painting of a black Madonna whose elephant dung
and pornographic touches have incurred the wrath of Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani and stirred a religious, cultural and political furor in
the city, was attacked at the Brooklyn Museum of Art Thursday by a
man who smeared paint on it but did no permanent damage, the
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Feigning illness to lull a security guard, the man, identified
as 72-year-old Dennis Heiner, of Manhattan, leaned against a wall,
darted behind a plexiglass shield, took out a plastic bottle and
squeezed white paint in a broad stroke across the face and body of
the Madonna, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   As the stunned guard and several museum visitors watched in
horror and shouted, ``Don't!'' and ``Stop!'' the man used his hands
to smear the paint over about a quarter of the surface of the
8-by-6-foot painting, ``The Holy Virgin Mary,'' by Chris Ofili, a
British artist of Nigerian descent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He covered the head and face down to the shoulders and then
down to the breast line,'' said David Eigenberg, who witnessed the
incident at 2:33 p.m. in a small, fifth-floor gallery of the museum
on Eastern Parkway. He said he made a move to stop the man, but was
told by the guard to stay back.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, while the guard radioed for help, the man emerged
from behind the plexiglass, his paint-smeared hands shaking
nervously, but made no effort to get away. As other security
officials raced up, the guard, whose name was not disclosed, asked:
``Why did you do it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's blasphemous,'' the man replied quietly.
</P>
<P>
   James G. Kelly, the museum's security manager, said the guard
had not halted the attack because he had been surprised, and he
called the reaction correct under the circumstances. ``They're here
to truly observe and report,'' he said of the guards. ``If they can
come between someone in an act of aggression, they can stop it. But
they're not peace officers and have no arrest powers.''
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, the police arrived, handcuffed Heiner and led
him away. He was charged with criminal mischief in the second
degree, a class D felony. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   He was being held Thursday night in Brooklyn awaiting an
arraignment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who said she was Heiner's wife, Helena, said he was a
devout Roman Catholic who believed the painting, adorned with
elephant dung on one breast and cutouts from pornographic
magazines, was sacrilegious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The painting was offensive, he's absolutely right about
that,'' the woman said in a telephone interview. ``This painting is
your mother, the painting of the blessed mother, the mother of
Christ. So he said, `I will go there today and try to clean it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the attack, museum conservators removed the
painting and within an hour had cleaned it before the white paint
was dry, leaving the artwork apparently undamaged. ``It's like a
stain _ the sooner you get at it the better your chances of
removing it,'' said Sally Williams, a spokeswoman for the museum,
who noted that the painting would be back on display Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, in a statement, said that the trustees and staff
were ``shocked and extremely saddened by this incomprehensible
act.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ofili painting is part of an exhibit, ``Sensation: Young
British Artists from the Saatchi Collection,'' that has been one of
the most successful, and controversial, in the 177-year history of
the Brooklyn Museum. Charles Saatchi, the British advertising
magnate, owns the paintings and sculptures and is the show's
largest financial backer.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, a week before the exhibit's opening, Giuliani
led a chorus of protests by various groups, including the Catholic
league, objecting to the Ofili painting, a collage of paper, oil
paint, glitter and resin on linen. It depicts a black Madonna in
flowing blue robes, with a shellacked clump of dung on one breast
and cutouts of female genitalia from pornographic magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Calling it ``sick stuff,'' repulsive and offensive to Roman
Catholicism, Giuliani denounced the museum for mounting the
exhibit, vowed to cut off its $7.2 million annual city subsidy,
then withheld the city's monthly subsidy payment and began
proceedings to evict the museum.
</P>
<P>
   A federal court battle ensued. The museum, backed by cultural
organizations, noted that Ofili often used elephant dung and other
unusual materials in his work as a cultural reference to his
African heritage, and contended that the mayor was violating the
free-speech rights of the artist and the museum in attempting to
suppress of exhibit. Judge Nina Gershon sided with the museum and
ordered the city to resume its subsidies and end its eviction
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Since the show's opening on Oct. 2, nearly 130,000 visitors have
flocked to see the ``Sensation'' show, making it the most
successful exhibit of contemporary art ever put on by the museum,
Ms. Williams said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Because of the controversy surrounding the painting, the museum
had wanted to post 21 guards for the exhibition, which features
more than 90 items on the museum's fourth and fifth floors. But
requests by Saatchi, who put up $160,000, increased costs, and the
museum had to pare down the security staff to 10 guards.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, one museum official said, Saatchi had objected to a
piece of plexiglass that would have completely enclosed Ofili's
painting. Instead, a piece slightly larger than the painting was
hung from the ceiling, leaving gaps of several feet on either side
and a four-foot separation from the surface of the painting.
</P>
<P>
   Heiner, who the police said was arrested in 1990 on a charge of
obstructing government administration in a protest, bought his
$9.75 ticket to the exhibition at the museum entrance Thursday and
took an elevator to the fifth floor, where Ofili's painting is
hung, along with only one other item _ Ron Meuck's ``Mask'' _ in a
small, 12-foot-wide gallery between two larger rooms.
</P>
<P>
   After walking through several galleries, Heiner approached a
guard and said he was feeling dizzy and ill, said Kelly. The guard
advised him to sit down. He then approached the guard near the
Ofili painting and again said he was dizzy and ill.
</P>

   He was clad in a herringbone sport coat and dark trousers and
did not seem suspicious. ``He was very dapper,'' Kelly said. ``He
looked like a typical museum visitor.''

choosing his moment, suddenly darted behind the plexiglass,

SCHOOLS CHANCELLOR CRITICIZED FOR REMARK ABOUT COUNCILMAN'S
HEIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A gibe by Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew that an
obscure freshman city councilman was ``too short'' to demand his
resignation _ and should come back when he's taller _ set off a
storm of criticism Thursday during one of the most challenging
periods in the chancellor's career.
</P>
<P>
   Some dismissed the remark as humorous in a city of much
diversity, including in height, but others criticized Crew for
serving as a poor role model for children. Thirty of the 51 City
Council members called on him to apologize. His remarks emboldened
his critics and led to new calls for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The dustup began Wednesday when Stephen Fiala, a councilman from
Staten Island, blamed Crew's management for recent cheating and
attendance scandals and called on him to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, cornered by reporters, Crew retorted: ``He's too
short to talk to me about that.'' Then, with a slight laugh, he
added, ``He can call for my resignation _ till he's taller.'' Crew
is about 6 feet tall; Fiala, according to his driver's license, is
5-foot-6.
</P>
<P>
   Crew said Thursday that he felt no need to apologize because he
had been misunderstood. He said he had been using an expression
that his father used to describe someone as short-sighted, and was
not referring to Fiala's height.
</P>
<P>
   The ruckus has come as Crew has been publicly and privately
agonizing over whether to accept a job offer in Seattle and as his
relationship with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a former ally, has grown
strained.

TAX LAW MUST ADJUST TO INTERNET COMMERCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The debate over taxing Internet transactions
took a constructive turn this week when an e-commerce advisory
panel focused on the need to simplify the nation's crazy quilt of
sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Levying Internet taxes in the context of today's system defies
the most basic principles of taxation. As Adam Smith admonished in
his Wealth of Nations, taxes should be convenient to pay and not
cost more to collect than they generate in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional mail-order tax model is catalog shopping, which
has posed tax-collection problems for as long as catalogs have been
a significant part of the retail scene. The Internet challenge is
the catalog problem writ larger.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the difficulty is the Constitution. Twice since the
'70s, states have been on the losing side of Supreme Court
decisions concerning imposition of taxes on out-of-state
businesses. Beyond the legal barriers, though, are more daunting
practical considerations.
re are thousands of U.S. taxing jurisdictions applying
different rates and exemptions on certain products. Rationalizing
these myriad tax situations is possible with sophisticated computer
programs, but such programs might be more expensive and unwieldy
than small Internet entrepreneurs can afford or are capable of
dealing with.
</P>
<P>
   The Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce, a 19-member
public-private panel chartered by Congress last year to study
Internet taxation issues, came to grips with this problem at its
San Francisco meeting this week by exploring systemic reform. One
expert witness told the group ``radical simplification'' of
existing sales taxes in exchange for stronger enforcement
mechanisms might provide the basis for compromise among sharply
divided members.
</P>
<P>
   The enforcement problem is critical because Internet sales taxes
under the current system are likely to generate a lot more hassle
and expense for many taxing jurisdictions than potential revenues
could ever justify.
</P>
<P>
   An e-commerce expert who helps large companies develop online
sales programs says sales taxes are an anachronism. Raul Fernandez,
head of Proxicom, recently told Investor's Business Daily that
``the sales tax is a relic of the old economy, and has no place in
the new global economy. It is backward thinking to apply something
designed for the physical world in the virtual world.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be, if observers such as Fernandez are right, that the
new-era economy demands new methods to fund government's needs.
Perhaps the sales tax is on its way to becoming a
revenue-generating dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it's not fair to expect Main Street retailers to
continue to be tax collectors while increasing numbers of
cyberrivals sell their goods taxless, and thus more cheaply, and
with less government meddling.
</P>
<P>
   This reality leads to the question of whether government has a
divine right to profit from the sale of goods and services. Almost
nobody much questions this right, even though the sales tax is
generally conceded to be one of the most regressive methods of
taxation.
</P>
<P>
   Economic relationships are undergoing profound changes, and
governments must adjust if they are to adequately and fairly serve
the needs of all their constituents.

DEVILS EDGE CANADIENS BEHIND MCKAY, OR WAS IT HOLIK? 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Just two days after scoring seven goals, their
largest production of the season, the New Jersey Devils barely
mustered two goals Thursday night. But that was still enough for a
2-1 victory over the lowly Montreal Canadiens, who have had more
injuries this season than any other team in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   Randy McKay, who assisted on Jay Pandolfo's goal, which tied the
score early in the second period, was credited with the winning
goal. It came with 20.9 seconds left in the game when McKay jumped
in front of Montreal's goaltender, Jose Theodore, and appeared to
deflect home Bobby Holik's shot from the right circle.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Robbie Ftorek said that it was Holik's goal and that the
Devils would pursue having the official scoring changed. But Holik
was not upset that the goal belonged to McKay. ``If he didn't touch
it,'' Holik said with a laugh, ``it went through his aura, and
that's enough for me.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he had touched Holik's shot, McKay said: ``I still
don't know. I hope I touched it. I jumped and the shot came.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second consecutive victory on the road for the Devils
(17-10-3). They are 5-7-1 on the road this season after setting a
league record for road victories last season with 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big win on the road for us and it makes us feel good,''
goaltender Martin Brodeur said. ``You worry a little after scoring
seven goals, but tonight we played a tight game, the way we're
supposed to on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, who took 32 shots at Theodore, tended to lose the
puck in their zone, especially during the early going, but they
were saved by Brodeur, whose only lapse was a short-handed goal by
Craig Darby, which opened the scoring 9 minutes 38 seconds into the
game. It was only the second such goal allowed by New Jersey this
season. But that was it for Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes into the game, Brodeur, who has missed just one
start in the last 22 games, alertly came off his line to narrow the
angle on a shot by Martin Rucinsky during a breakaway. Brodeur used
his left skate to deny Rucinsky, the Canadiens' leading scorer, who
tried to deke him with a left-to-right move.
</P>
<P>
   Just 47 seconds after the first intermission, Pandolfo took a
pass from McKay from the left side and beat Theodore over the glove
from the slot. It was Pandolfo's third goal of the season and it
tied the score. McKay's next point in the game was the game-winning
goal. Or maybe it was Holik's.

DON'T BLAME EVERY TECHNO-GLITCH ON Y2K, WHITE HOUSE Y2K CZAR SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HAYES  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ For about 12 hours, U.S. Army Maj. Eric Van
Vliet was a computer glitch multimillionaire.
</P>
<P>
   The logistics instructor at Fort Leavenworth's Army Command and
General Staff College moved $18,950 into a Charles Schwab Roth IRA
account and found that his investment had done ... well, pretty
darn good.
</P>
<P>
   When Van Vliet received the Dec. 8 letter confirming the new
account, his ``credit cash balance'' was $84,281,186.
</P>
<P>
   No such luck, Major. A clerical mistake caused a computer
glitch. Your $18,950 transfer was worth ... well, about $18,950.
</P>
<P>
   With less than a month until the year 2000, Van Vliet assumed it
was a Y2K problem. It wasn't. And that's the point.
</P>
<P>
   When you're dealing with technology, stuff just happens,
contends John Koskinen, the White House's Y2K czar. And stuff will
happen, as usual, this New Year's weekend.
</P>
<P>
   So don't assume every techno-glitch is sparked by Y2K, Koskinen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Glitches at electric generating plants knock out power to an
average American home for about 13 hours every year _ in addition
to longer outages every year caused by major storms.
</P>
<P>
   A railroad accident happens somewhere in the United States every
51/2 hours on a typical New Year's Day. On average, a low-level
emergency involving a nuclear power plant happens more than twice a
day between Dec. 28 and Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   And about 8 percent to 10 percent of all ATM transactions fail
the first time _ most often because we hit a wrong key when typing
in a pass code or try to take out more money than we have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day things go wrong, and nobody pays much attention to
them, nobody thinks twice about it,'' Koskinen said in a news
release. ``But any of those things that happen on Jan. 1st will
immediately be presumed to be the indication of a Y2K problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In short? Sure, have a little extra food, cash and even water on
hand Jan. 1. But don't worry. Go party.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen's comments came earlier this week, the latest attempt
by the Clinton administration to make sure undue panic doesn't
cause more problems than Y2K itself.
</P>
<P>
   A ``fact sheet'' put together by Koskinen's office shows how a
wide variety of problems go unnoticed by consumers every day:
</P>
<P>
   - On a bad day, 1 percent of the nation's traffic signals
malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   - More than 400 commercial flights are delayed by 15 minutes or
more on a normal New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   - An average, large ``911'' emergency system experiences one
``disruption'' every week.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Van Vliet, well, he knew when he received the letter he
wasn't a multimillionaire. But it makes for a good tale.
</P>
<P>
   Van Vliet had moved some Roth IRA funds from one brokerage to
Schwab. The Dec. 8 letter confirming the transaction was
straightforward enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transfer ... to your Charles Schwab account is now
complete. ... Below is a listing of the assets that have been
received.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Credit cash balance ... $84,281,186.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for moving your assets to Charles Schwab,'' the
letter concluded.
</P>
<P>
   A responsible investor, Van Vliet called Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy was kind of speechless. He kind of chuckled and said,
`Just don't do anything until we call you back,' '' Van Vliet said.
``They basically said they had some problems with automation.''
</P>
<P>
   The $84 million mistake was all on paper. A Schwab spokesman
said the money was never really in Van Vliet's account. It was an
error in a letter that didn't affect the account.
</P>
<P>
   Drat.
</P>
<P>
   How does Van Vliet feel about Schwab?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely pleased with my initial balance,'' Van Vliet
said. ``The gains over that period were like an Internet IPO,'' he
said, referring to the hot-market dot-com stocks that skyrocket
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is a prelude, I'm extremely excited about Y2K,'' Van
Vliet said. ``I can't wait for the beginning of the new year.''

PHILIP MORRIS EXECUTIVE IS TAKING COMPANY'S NEW MESSAGE TO PUBLIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ With the fervor of an evangelist, Steven C.
Parrish, a Philip Morris Cos. Inc. senior vice president, is
crisscrossing the land, telling how the company that purveys
tobacco and alcohol also sells food products and is doing its part
to help Americans.
</P>
<P>
   It's a dramatic change from the company's previous stance on
communicating with the public and the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``For so long, we've been perceived as being bad and only about
tobacco,'' said Parrish, who visited Kansas City, Mo., last week
and made similar stops recently in Denver and Tulsa, Okla. ``And a
lot of that was our fault. The media would call and all they got
was a `no comment.' They had no idea of what we were doing for the
community, if anything.''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Parrish said, the company is much more than Marlboro
and its other tobacco brands.
</P>
<P>
   Few people know that Philip Morris owns Kraft, the largest food
company in the United States, or that it owns Miller Brewing Co.
</P>
<P>
   Or that:
</P>
<P>
   - It spends millions each year on programs to prevent children
from smoking and to encourage people to ``Think When You Drink.''
</P>
<P>
   - It annually donates millions of dollars worth of goods to food
pantries.
</P>
<P>
   - Bottling plants in areas hit by floods stop bottling beer and
start bottling drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   - It supports numerous shelters, facilities and programs to help
battered women.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those efforts, some still perceive Philip Morris as
hypocritical for supporting such programs while it sells products
that contribute to societal ills.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a study released this week found a strong link
between the use of alcohol and physical abuse in homes. The study
found more than three times the risk of domestic violence when
husbands or male partners abuse alcohol or drugs, go in and out of
jobs, or break up with their partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This study offers the strongest evidence so far that links
alcohol abuse by the male partner with domestic violence,''
Demetrios N. Kyriacou of Olive View-UCLA Medical Center, the lead
researcher, told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish acknowledges that there is a link between alcohol abuse
and domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``But to me that's an additional reason why Philip Morris should
be involved in programs to end domestic violence _ when people
consume too much of one of our products and violence results,''
Parrish said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the efforts to stop youths from smoking, Parrish says Philip
Morris takes the stand that people shouldn't make the decision to
smoke until they're adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``One, it's a dangerous product,'' Parrish said, ``And two,
society has decided _ and I agree _ that for dangerous products
like cigarettes, the decision is more appropriately made after
you're an adult.''
</P>
<P>
   Parrish says that he has been asked many times why the company
continues to sell controversial products and that the answer mostly
has to do with money.
</P>
<P>
   In the company's most recent quarter, tobacco and beer
constituted 67 percent of its sales and 73 percent of its profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, these products are a big, big part of Philip
Morris,'' Parrish said. ``But there are other products and issues,
too. I mean we sell Jell-O, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, Post Raisin
Bran, Maxwell House _ some of the best-known brands in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Gustav Carlson, author of the recently published Total Exposure:
Controlling Your Company's Image in the Glare of the Business Media
Explosion, credits Philip Morris for trying to get its message out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like nature, the public and media abhor a vacuum,'' Carlson
said. ``If you don't fill it with your own message, others will do
it for you, and I think that's what's happened with Philip Morris
for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The company currently is trying to get its message out through
four television commercials. All the commercials carry the same
theme line: ``Working to make a difference. The people of Philip
Morris.''
</P>
<P>
   One features a woman who had been battered by her husband. One
night, he threatened her with a knife and barely missed their son.
</P>
<P>
   Another features folks in Elba, Ala., who had been flooded out
of their homes. A nearby beer bottling plant stopped bottling beer
and started bottling water.
</P>
<P>
   The third shows an older woman who recently had been sick and
ended up having to rely on a food pantry for goods.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth is aimed at showing Philip Morris' commitment to stop
underage smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you agree their products are dangerous or not, I think
it's courageous of them to come out and tackle some of the
problems,'' Carlson said. ``If they came out with some sort of
image campaign with puppies and butterflies, trying to separate
themselves from their products, that would be stupid _ people are
too smart to buy into that.''
</P>
<P>
   Parrish acknowledges that his mission is sometimes stressful.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when it's frustrating, when I get
disappointed, but mostly I feel upbeat because I really do think
we're doing the right thing in talking about some of the difficult
issues that are tied to some of our products,'' Parrish said.
```But you're right _ it's not always easy.''

JUDGES HEAR ARGUMENTS OVER RELEASE OF DOCUMENTS IN GM LIABILITY
TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The documents are precious to Kenneth and Steven
Baker.
</P>
<P>
   In them, the Bakers see proof that General Motors did little to
prevent cars from catching fire. Their mother died in 1990 while
riding in a Chevrolet Blazer that went up in flames after a wreck.
</P>
<P>
   GM values the documents, too, and the company says they deserve
the sacred legal protection of attorney-client privilege. No jury
in the Bakers' liability case should ever view them, GM says.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals heard from both
sides in St. Louis on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The document dispute will help shape the longest-running product
liability lawsuit in Kansas City's federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1973 document, GM employee Edward Ivey suggests that it
would be cheaper for the company to settle liability lawsuits than
spend more than $2.20 per car to prevent potential fires. The
document has already been made public.
</P>
<P>
   In February, U.S. Magistrate Sarah Hays in Kansas City ordered
GM to turn over other documents that plaintiffs say show that the
company knew of Ivey's analysis.
</P>
<P>
   A liability trial is on hold until the judges decide GM's appeal
of Hays' ruling. That could take several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a fishing expedition,'' Kenneth Chesebro, one of
the Bakers' attorneys, told the judges on Thursday. ``There is no
other way to get access to these facts.''
</P>
<P>
   GM disputes the plaintiffs' claims, saying the documents don't
pertain to the Bakers' case. The company also notes that Ivey has
testified that GM knew nothing of the cost-benefit study.
</P>
<P>
   While plaintiffs say the internal documents merely repeat facts
already public, GM argued that they reflected the thinking and
opinions of attorneys and should stay privileged.
</P>
<P>
   GM repeated its argument that the plaintiffs' attorneys are free
to question Ivey in court and don't need the documents.
</P>
<P>
   GM attorney Jay Lefkowitz argued Thursday that upholding Hays'
ruling would have grave implications for attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Her ruling would ``literally obliterate'' the privilege and
alter the attorney-client relationship ``for all time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Judge David R. Hansen questioned Lefkowitz's ``doomsday
arguments,'' noting that other judges have waived the privilege in
certain cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sky hasn't fallen,'' Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the stakes are high for GM.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, a Florida judge ordered GM to hand over some
of the same damaging documents. A jury eventually awarded $33
million to the family of two children who died in the fiery crash
of an Oldsmobile station wagon.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer watchdogs are closely monitoring the Baker case,
speculating that a plaintiff victory could expose GM to a wave of
liability suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``On an interest-level scale of 1 to 10, the Baker case is a
10,'' said Clarence Ditlow, executive director of Ralph Nader's
Center for Auto Safety, in an interview on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to the case,'' he added, ``is the documents.''
</P>
<P>
   In her ruling, Hays said trying to protect potentially damaging
documents is an ``abuse'' of the attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   The privilege is generally untouchable except in cases where a
party has used it to commit a crime, such as perjury or obstruction
of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Hays wrote that the document dispute ``has consumed endless
amounts of time and has effectively sidetracked this litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Baker case already has reached trial once.
</P>
<P>
   At that trial, the plaintiffs' attorneys argued that a fuel pump
continued to feed gasoline into the engine after the collision
involving the Bakers' mother, Beverly Garner of Bevier, Mo. That
caused the fire, they said.
</P>
<P>
   GM says Garner was dead before the fire even started.
</P>
<P>
   Before the case even reached a jury, U.S. District Judge Joseph
E. Stevens in 1993 declared the pump defective to punish GM for not
turning over documents. A jury awarded the Bakers $11.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   But an appeals court, ruling that Stevens' punishment was too
harsh, threw out the judgment and ordered a new trial.

FEDERAL FRAUD, CONSPIRACY STATUTES COME INTO PLAY IN RUSH
SUSPENSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ JaRon and Kareem Rush, two of the best prep
basketball players ever to come out of Kansas City, have been
suspended by the universities they play for after a federal grand
jury questioned JaRon and investigators talked to Kareem.
</P>
<P>
   The universities say it's possible National Collegiate Athletic
Association rules have been violated. But such violations are not
necessarily a crime. So a lot of people are wondering: What does a
federal grand jury have to do with college athletics?
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the probe, a source familiar with the legal
theory in play told The Kansas City Star on Thursday, is the novel
application of federal fraud and conspiracy statutes often used in
public corruption cases.
</P>
<P>
   The source said prosecutors would argue that an athlete who
falsely certified to a university that he was amateur could be
guilty of defrauding the school. Each year, athletes sign a letter
verifying their amateur status, saying they have taken no money for
playing their sport.
</P>
<P>
   But the athletes would not necessarily be the focus of such a
probe. Those who paid the athletes and endangered their amateur
status could be under scrutiny under federal bribery statutes, the
source said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legal theory being tested, should the athlete lose his
amateur status, and his eligibility to play college sports, the
university would have been deprived of his ``good and faithful''
servicesd the university be sanctioned by the NCAA, damages
could be measured in the form of lost ticket sales, tournament
revenues and unpaid television money.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors would have jurisdiction over such a case
because the U.S. government funnels millions of dollars in grants
to public and private universities each year.
</P>
<P>
   The source declined to speak specifically about the current
probe, citing grand jury secrecy. It was unclear what prompted the
probe or how wide its scope is.
</P>
<P>
   The Rush brothers have declined to comment since their
suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   West Coast press reports have said JaRon Rush, who attends the
University of California-Los Angeles, acknowledged to investigators
accepting ``considerably less than $500'' from Los Angeles sports
agent Jerome Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley has denied making the payments.
</P>
<P>
   Kareem Rush reportedly acknowledged accepting a pair of shoes
and $50 in cash on one or more occasions from his summer basketball
coach, Myron Piggie, before entering college. Such payments for
expenses are allowed under NCAA rules, and sources told The Kansas
City Star that an expedited University of Missouri-Columbia
investigation could clear the way for Kareem Rush to return to the
team by a Dec. 30 game against Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Kareem Rush's situation is less serious than that of his
brother because there are no reports that he was ever involved with
a sports agent. Under NCAA rules, accepting anything from an agent
is a clear violation.
</P>
<P>
   Piggie, a former consultant for the Nike Corp., has acknowledged
paying for the athletes' meals and providing each with a pair of
shoes, but denied giving they anything that would jeopardize their
college eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Law professors said the government's legal theory is unusual,
though not unprecedented, and wonder if it will hold up through the
actual filing of charges, should that ever happen.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Mitten, director of the National Sports Law Institute in
Milwaukee, said a better solution to policing college sports would
be to write state laws allowing universities to sue if an athlete
misrepresents his eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri, he pointed out, already has a law allowing
universities to sue athletes and their agents in such a case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this such a big pervasive thing that there's such harm that
it justifies federal criminal prosecution?'' Mitten asked. ``I
would say I don't think it's appropriate for, in essence, a
violation of NCAA rules to constitute a federal crime. If we're
going to do it, there should be more laws that would more directly
apply.''
</P>
<P>
   Roscoe Howard, a professor of criminal law at the University of
Kansas, found more merit in the government's approach, though he
agreed it was an unusual reading of the statutes.
</P>
<P>
   He also was more willing to give federal prosecutors leeway in
determining what issues in their areas deserve the attention of
federal criminal code.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction,'' Howard said.
``A lot of time you'll find the federal government jumping into a
problem that the local jurisdiction can't handle.''
</P>
<P>
   A crucial element of a sports fraud case would be the annual
statement signed by each athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Every athlete at NCAA-affiliated schools is required to sign the
``Student-Athlete Statement.'' That document, provided by the NCAA,
is the athlete's written acknowledgement that he or she is eligible
for collegiate competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's designed to protect the institution,'' said Jim Epps,
senior associate athletic director at Kansas State University. ``It
puts the athlete on the spot.''
</P>
<P>
   The amateurism part of the statement clearly notes that athletes
are ``not eligible for participation in a sport if you have ever
taken pay, or the promise of pay, for competing in that sport.'' It
also states that athletes are not eligible if they used their
athletic skills for pay ``in any form.''
</P>
<P>
   The athletes are required to sign the statement before the first
competition of his or her respective season. The athletes must
re-sign them every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Institutions are supposed to know whether their athletes are
eligible,'' said Athena Yiamouyiannis, a director of membership
services for the NCAA. ``They need help from the student
athletes.''

   APPLES-DALLAS (Dallas, Texas) _ The words and music have stuck
in my mind for 40-odd years, because they seemed so apt. Frank
Loesser wrote them for a musical called ``The Most Happy Fella,''
and they stopped the show every time. ``You're from Big D I can
guess,'' a brassy dame sang, ``by the way you drawl and the way you
dress. You're from Big D, my, oh yes. I mean Big D, little a,
double l, a, s. And that spells Dallas, my darlin', darlin' Dallas
... where every home's a palace, 'cause the settlers settle for no
less.'' Big money, big hair, big talk. Such is the lingering
stereotype of this city. It occupies a sizable spot in the national
consciousness as the home of the big, bad Dallas Cowboys, of J.R.
Ewing and Miss Ellie and all the gang at Southfork, and of the
little guy with the big ears and bigger ambition, H. Ross Perot,
who was a billionaire before he turned 40. And for those old enough
to recall the events of November 1963, it occupies an especially
dark corner of memory, as the cursed place where John F. Kennedy
was shot. Yet Dallas and its smaller sibling, Fort Worth, an
unmatched pair if ever there was one, amount to much more than
that. Together with the little cities that cluster around them like
pilot fish, they constitute the largest metropolitan area in the
nation's second largest state. They boast the largest collection of
major corporate headquarters outside of New York and Chicago. By
R.W. Apple Jr.

<P>
   TEXACO-OPERA (New York) _ Opera has long been saddled with the
perception that it is a pricey art form for elitist audiences. But
it is hard to make the elitism charge stick when for 60 years the
Saturday matinees of the Metropolitan Opera have been broadcast
live across the United States and Canada, sponsored by Texaco.
``The Texaco-Metropolitan Opera International Radio Broadcasts,''
as the series is officially called, represents the longest
continuous commercial sponsorship in broadcast history. (Met
performances were first heard on radio nine years earlier.) The
broadcasts have also been carried live in Europe since 1990.
Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong were added later, and this
year the network was extended to Brazil. When the current radio
season ends on April 22 with Wagner's ``Gotterdammerung,'' Texaco
will have sponsored the broadcasts of 1,192 live performances of
142 operas. It is estimated that 10 million listeners tune in each
season. What other art form has been made so available to so many
people for so long? By Anthony Tommasini.

   MET-DESIGN-EXHIBIT (New York) _ Proving once again that it can
mount a boutique of a show with the same panache as a five-alarm
blockbuster, the Metropolitan Museum has unveiled an exquisite
sampling of 20th-century design objects from its own collection. A
salute rather than a full survey, ``A Century of Design, Part I:
1900-1925'' is installed in several intimate galleries in the
20th-century wing. It displays more than 50 examples of furniture,
metalwork, glass, ceramics, textiles, jewelry and drawings, from a
fanciful Pompeiian-style dressing table of bronze and basalt by the
French designer Armand-Albert Rateau to a silver claret jug with
sinuous curves and flyaway thumb-piece, the work of the English

SHAQ BLASTS REFS AGAIN AFTER LAKERS WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Shaquille O'Neal's jump shots bounced as wildly as his
free throws, his scrums with Dikembe Mutombo knocked his rhythm
off-kilter, and the flurry of fouls that followed eventually
knocked him off the floor entirely.
</P>
<P>
   But stopping the Lakers' winning streak proved as difficult as
stopping O'Neal from trashing the officials. Both efforts were
pointless.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers did win Thursday night, riding Kobe Bryant's
season-high 30 points to a 95-88 victory over the Atlanta Hawks at
Phillips Arena. It was their fourth consecutive win, 11th in their
last 12 games, and pushed their NBA-best record to 19-5.
</P>
<P>
   And O'Neal did vent afterward, following a frustrating night in
which he made four of 15 shots, scored just nine points and fouled
out with 5 minutes, 54 seconds left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to hold back _ ``I'd rather save my money, it's
Christmastime,'' he said _ but then...
</P>
<P>
   ``Three refs out there, six fouls _ one guy called five fouls,''
O'Neal said, referring to Monty McCutchen. ``That should tell you
something about these (bleeping) idiots that they got calling the
game. They suck. They stink. They need to get some new ones.''
</P>
<P>
   And about that Christmas money going to pay another NBA fine?
``Don't care. I don't give a (bleep).''
</P>
<P>
   Well, at least O'Neal kept his composure until he reached the
locker room.
</P>
<P>
   The same couldn't be said for Isaiah Rider, the Hawks' volatile
guard. Rider led Atlanta with a team-high 33 points, but he missed
13 of 24 shots and drew the wrath of a fan on his way off the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Rider engaged him in a shouting match, which reached its low
point when Rider _ held back by security staff _ yelled to the man,
``Stay right there _ I got some boys that will come see you.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they'll be available to help him defend against Bryant
next time too. Rider and Bryant did most of the on-court jousting
for the evening, trading jump shot for jump shot.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant hit 10 of 19 field goals and made 10 of 11 foul shots to
win the battle, and prove the Lakers can win, on the road, even
without a 30-point night from O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if anything it will build character,'' Bryant said,
``because there's certain times when he might get in foul trouble
or I might get in foul trouble, and we have to step up as a unit
and do it together.... (The win) will build confidence, maybe not
for tomorrow night but later on, in April, in May.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes a village to replace an MVP candidate, and the Lakers
found a few willing citizens. John Salley filled in for O'Neal and
contributed seven points in 20 minutes. Derek Fisher pitched in 10
points off the bench, and Rick Fox, seven.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice's 11 points were second only to Bryant's, but he
missed 12 of 17 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Mutombo had a bit to do with the Lakers' 40 percent shooting. He
blocked four shots, misdirected several others and, of course,
eliminated O'Neal as a threat.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Lakers built a double-digit lead in the third
quarter, holding Atlanta to 18 points, and maintained their cushion
throughout the fourth, despite 13 points from Rider.
</P>
<P>
   ``(O'Neal) started off with Mutombo getting a couple blocks that
probably should have been fouls that weren't called,'' coach Phil
Jackson said, ``and it just kind of grew from there. One thing led
to another and I think that ultimately he wasn't even given a
chance to play in the last part of the game. Everything seemed to
be a foul, whatever he did. ... Some nights are going to be like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, since O'Neal only played 28 minutes, he saved
his energy for the three games the Lakers play in the next four
days. And they got away with a win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means we're a pretty good team,'' O'Neal said. ``We just
have to maintain our pace and just get better. We're going to be
fine. I like the way this team is playing now.''

FISHER REWARDS TITANS' PATIENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (begin ital)``He's one of the rising stars in the NFL. In 10
years, you could see Jeff Fisher as an NFL head coach,'' John
Robinson, Los Angeles Rams coach in their 1991 media guide. ``See
how smart I am?'' Robinson, 1999.(end ital) &QL; 
OK, but not that smart. Robinson was only off by seven years.
Fisher actually joined the NFL head coaching fraternity in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even more amazing than his rocket rise, may have been his
ability to remain in NFL head-coaching orbit with the Tennessee
Titans _ without having had a single winning season in his five
years.
</P>
<P>
   And now the patience of owner Bud Adams and general manager
Floyd Reese is being rewarded. Fisher has the Titans at 10-3, one
victory from locking up a playoff berth, and starting to look very
much like a rising NFL power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the successful owners,'' Robinson said. ``The
impatient owners are the losers.''
</P>
<P>
   Patience never seemed allowed in Fisher's resume, but then
perhaps no coach in professional sports ever had to deal with what
he did the past four years with the wanderlust Titans/Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This situation is so unique,'' Reese said. ``We've gone
through a four-year period unlike any in the history of any team in
the NFL. In over four years we've played in four different
stadiums, in three different cities, in two different states under
three different names.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher had his training wheels removed when first named interim
coach for the Houston Oilers in 1994 at the age of 36. The interim
tag went the following season and he improved a team that had gone
2-14 the previous year to 7-9. Then came the first of three
successive 8-8 campaigns as Adams took his team on tour.
</P>
<P>
   As the Adelphia Coliseum was being constructed in Nashville, the
rebuilding Oilers played their home games at the Liberty Bowl in
Memphis while still practicing in Houston. Average home attendance
that season: 28,095.
</P>
<P>
   The next season, the neo-Titans played their home games at
Vanderbilt University in Nashville. Then finally, this season the
waters calmed and they opened up shop at a new practice facility in
Nashville and began calling the Adelphia Coliseum home.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, the boyish-looking Fisher remained at the team's
helm. Fisher, the former Taft High wide receiver star and a
standout defensive back for Robinson at USC, received his NFL
head-coaching indoctrination under a less than ideal situation, and
surprisingly, management actually understood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who know this business understand the
circumstances,'' Fisher said. ``They understand how difficult it is
to win when things are perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that all those things are behind us and we're finally at
an even playing field with the rest of the National Football
League, the expectation level is higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first year I haven't had to sit in meetings
regarding stadium construction, or facility construction, or team
travel, or whatever. Try moving a franchise in a month from one
state to another, and then start a season five weeks after that. I
didn't have to do that this year.''
</P>
<P>
   What a concept, a coach who just has to coach. Safe to say,
Fisher has adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Titans are shaping up, all things suddenly seem
possible. Despite having spent almost half his 41 years in the NFL,
he remains a very young head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a chance, if he develops the right circumstance, to
be one of the all-time coaches,'' said Robinson, now head coach at
UNLV. ``Don Shula started at an extremely young age. Tom Landry was
quite young when he got his job. Those are the guys, if they stay
in a long time, wind up in that top group.''
</P>
<P>
   This is high praise for someone experiencing his first winning
season (current lifetime record: 42-41), but things always seemed
to have come quickly to Fisher. He played defensive back at USC
with Ronnie Lott, Dennis Smith and Joey Browner and was then a
seventh-round pick of the Chicago Bears in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   He spent five years as a defensive back and return specialist
for the Bears, capturing a Super Bowl ring in 1985 despite spending
the season on injured reserve with an ankle injury that ended his
year. Unable to play, he started assisting the defensive
coordinator. A guy named Buddy Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   When Ryan became the head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles, he
took Fisher with him as the defensive backs coach. Three years
later he was promoted to defensive coordinator at the ripe old age
of 30. He became the new guru of the ``46'' defense, and gained a
national rep as a bright young NFL mind who specialized in an
aggressive defense.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, he reunited with Robinson to become the Rams defensive
coordinator. Robinson saw the right combination of factors
converging with Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a great competitor as a player,'' Robinson said. ``He
played in the NFL far beyond his physical abilities. He began to
understand the intangible things involved in success probably
earlier than most.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got a tremendous opportunity when he left the Bears and
they immediately hired him on as one of their coaches. He went
right into the middle of high-level coaching at a young age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like he just mixes a great competitiveness with a great
intellect. He is very smart but not a cerebral coach, in terms that
he's very passionate. The combination of being smart and passionate
I think is very important for a coach, and he has those things.''
</P>
<P>
   That passion has not always been so obvious to Tennessee media
critics, who observe Joe Cool on the sidelines, glare hidden by
dark glasses, standing confidently with arms folded.
</P>
<P>
   Add that to his background and you get...
</P>
<P>
   ``The California Calm,'' Fisher said. ``It's not even a
criticism. It's more an adjective. It's just the perception of
someone being from California. The stereotypical laid back, calm,
quiet, kind of cool approach to things.''
</P>
<P>
   Reese said Fisher was able to remain calm and focused under the
team's trying circumstances the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could turn and focus on the things he knew he could take
care of, and that made a giant difference,'' Reese said. ``I mean,
it would have been real easy for that team to just crumble. There
were several times when things were not easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Fisher is hardly feeling heady by his first season of
genuine success. The team has a new name, new logo, new colors, new
stadium, but Fisher's old resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you ever feel you've arrived, then you're going to
let somebody down, whether it's your team, or your owner, or
yourself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to tell how good we are right now. I don't believe
we've played our best game yet. We are still not a well-rounded
team, but we are finding ways to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in this year of NFL parity, Fisher is not afraid to talk
about the Super Bowl. The Titans have a premier running back in
Eddie George, an all-time great guard in Bruce Matthews (a teammate
of Fisher's at USC), a rising star in rookie defensive end Jevon
Kearse, a team hungry to win and a head coach coming into his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's really maturing nicely,'' Reese said. ``Almost on
a weekly basis. I can see signs the way he handles the players, the
things he says to the team, the way he handles the coaches. You can
really see a maturation process that I think is going to put him in
position to win a lot of games.''

Titans' Kearse takes the league by storm as a rookie
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN McCLAIN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Jevon Kearse might be the best rookie
defensive player to enter the NFL since Lawrence Taylor in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Kearse, the Tennessee Titans' No. 1 draft choice, has 11{ sacks,
one behind the league's rookie record shared by Leslie O'Neal
(1986) and Simeon Rice (1996).
</P>
<P>
   Kearse, who plays the left side, leads the NFL with nine forced
fumbles and has a team-high seven tackles for losses. Kearse's 76
tackles are more than any lineman on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jevon plays as hard as any lineman I've seen in a long, long
time,'' Titans coach Jeff Fisher said. ``He does the kind of things
that can't be coached, things that make you go, `Wow.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe that if Jevon keeps the same work habits and
stays healthy, he can be as good as he wants to be. And he wants to
be the best. Ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicknamed ``The Freak'' by his University of Florida teammates
because of his extraordinary athleticism, the 6-5, 255-pound Kearse
ran the 40-yard dash at the Indianapolis scouting combine in 4.41
seconds. He has an 86-inch wingspan, and his hands seem as large as
manhole covers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he'd be very productive, and I expected him to make
a lot of plays as a rookie, but not this many,'' Fisher said. ``I
expected him to be a factor in the passing game, but there were
questions about how physical he would play against the run.
</P>
<P>
   ``His production in the running game has been the most
surprising. He's very instinctive, and he plays the same way
against the run as he does the pass. He can explode off a
double-team block, where most guys his size would have been crushed
and buried.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the No. 1 song on Sundays at Adelphia Coliseum is Le
Freak. The fans freak out every time Kearse makes a play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jevon's so explosive going to the ball,'' Fisher said. ``He
has unbelievable change of direction and closing speed. And his
up-field speed is as good as you'll find in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Kearse could become the first rookie defensive end
from the AFC to make the Pro Bowl since the merger in 1970. After
the regular season ends, Kearse is expected to be named NFL
Defensive Rookie of the Year. He has been named Defensive Rookie of
the Month two times.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Kearse's accomplishments even more impressive are the
almost unimaginable hardships he overcame while growing up in Fort
Myers, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Kearse was one of seven children reared by a single mother
because his father was murdered a few months before he was born. An
older brother, J.J., is serving time in prison. A younger brother,
Jermaine, was shot to death at 17 outside the family's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Kearse has used his family's misfortune as motivation on and off
the field. He's hoping his story will inspire others.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm on the field, I tell myself that the guy lining up
across from me could be the guy that shot my brother,'' he said.
``Sometimes, I ask myself what my life would be like now if I'd
grown up with a father. Maybe my younger brother would be alive.
Maybe my older brother wouldn't be in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then again, if I had grown up with a father, I may not have
pushed myself to be where I am right now. Maybe I wouldn't need to
play football because my mom and dad would have jobs, and I'd still
be in college working on my degree. By not having a father and
wanting to help my family be financially stable, I guess that's
motivated me to be the kind of person and player I am today.''
</P>
<P>
   Just what kind of person and player is Kearse? His teammates,
coaches and friends say he is shy, humble, polite and
well-mannered. He is the only member of his family to graduate from
high school. He needs one semester to earn his degree from Florida,
where he was a member of the National Honor Society.
</P>
<P>
   But Kearse is still a football player first, one whose
incredible speed, quickness and agility that combined with
unbridled enthusiasm have helped put the Titans one victory from
clinching a playoff berth for the first time since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Former defensive end Sean Jones, who was one of the league's
premier pass rushers for the Raiders, Oilers and Packers, was a
member of that 1993 team that finished 12-4, won the AFC Central
and lost in the second round to Kansas City in the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he came into the league, he could have been Lawrence
Taylor or Aundray Bruce,'' said Jones, an agent who tried to sign
Kearse as a client. ``So far, he's been L.T.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Tennessee drafted Jevon, I asked (general manager) Floyd
Reese what they were going to do with him. Floyd said, `Hey, Bo,
we're just going to drop him down and tell him to go.'
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that makes Jevon so good is he's relentless. He gets
blocked, but he plays with a great motor and he continues to make
plays. Some guys get blocked at the point of attack, and you can't
find them the rest of the game. Jevon gets blocked, but he sheds
and chases down plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many rookies who wear down as the season progresses,
Kearse has improved each week. Despite being double-teamed most of
the time, he has at least one-half sack in the last seven games.
During that period, he has 8{ sacks, 39 tackles and seven forced
fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jevon wants to be as good as there's ever been,'' Titans
defensive coordinator Gregg Williams said. ``As long as he stays
healthy and keeps that humble drive to be the best, he has the
ability to be the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid's just amazing. There are four or five plays a year
where no matter how intense a fan you are or how intense a coach
you are, you have to just watch and wonder at some of the things
he's done athletically.''
</P>
<P>
   To beef up the pass rush, the Titans hired University of Houston
defensive line coach Jim Washburn, drafted Kearse and defensive
tackle John Thornton in the first two rounds and signed veteran
free agents Jason Fisk and Mike Jones.
</P>
<P>
   With three games left, they have 46 sacks one season after
registering 30. They have a chance to break the team record of 52,
set in 1993 when the Buddy Ryan-coached defense led the NFL in
sacks and run defense.
</P>
<P>
   Kearse is the catalyst. His unrestrained exuberance is
contagious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very competitive, and I'm never satisfied with a
performance or with a play,'' Kearse said. ``I had three sacks in
the first Cleveland game, but I wasn't satisfied. I'm the same way
off the field, whether it's fishing or playing video games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my competitiveness comes from not having anything when
I was growing up. With seven kids, we had to reach out and grab
something if we wanted it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearse is reaching out and grabbing quarterbacks and running
backs in impressive fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches don't make the game too complicated,'' he said.
``They don't make me play like a robot. They let me use my talent.
They let me play my game.
</P>
<P>
   ``For instance, if I'm going against a 350-pound tackle, I know
he's slower than me. I'm not going to sit there and take him on.
I'm going to run around him and soften him up. You run around him a
couple of times, you beat him at an angle. If you go back door,
he'll start softening up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some players take on blocks by using good hand strength. I'll
do that when I have to do it. But if I don't have to do it, I'm
going to run around them and try to make a play in the backfield or
on the other side of the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearse left Florida after his junior year. He was supposed to go
high in the first round, but he lasted until the Titans selected
him with the 16th pick. He's working hard to prove a lot of teams
made mistakes by passing him up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they just didn't want to take a chance on taking a
`tweener' like me,'' Kearse said. ``I was moved around a lot in
college. I think other teams saw me as just a big, athletic guy.
Some thought I had to play outside linebacker. Others thought I was
just a pass rusher and not an every-down player. Teams didn't want
to take a chance, and that motivated me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every team that passed me up may not play us, but they can
pick up the paper, see our record and my stats.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Kearse played so many positions at Florida, scouts
didn't get a solid look at his performance against the run. When he
read that he was a one-dimensional player, Kearse found even more
incentive.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the day I was drafted, I worked out by myself back home
in Florida,'' he said. ``I worked on good run technique. I knew I
had to get stronger to play the run in the NFL. I got in the weight
room and got stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time I got to camp, I was playing the run better than I
was rushing the quarterback. I'd put a lot of anger in falling in
the draft, and I tried to justify it by telling myself that they
(scouts) said I couldn't play the run. It took a while for me to
stop the run and pass rush the way I'm capable.''
</P>
<P>
   The coaches say watching Kearse on game film is similar to
watching former Detroit running back Barry Sanders. Kearse does so
many things instinctively he doesn't realize it until he sees the
film, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' Kearse said, ``they (teammates and coaches) say,
`Man, how did you do that?' It just comes naturally. Sometimes, I
can't believe it myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, neither can his coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tremendously prideful kid,'' Williams said. ``Jevon
doesn't want to be recognized as a finesse player. The complete
player has to be a physical football player to play in the
trenches. A lot of it has to do with Jim Washburn, a coach who's
making a whole group of players more physical and aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jevon has such great flexibility in his hips that he's able to
dip and get faster on his third, fourth and fifth steps. To be a
complete player, he has to learn how to take speed to power, and he
needs to learn how to take speed and be able to work it back
underneath. He's just now starting to scratch the surface on those
things, and that's scary.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he gets those things down and adds a little more body
weight, he can be as good as anyone who has ever played on that
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearse had such problems keeping weight on that Fisher got a
nutritionist to prepare meals for him to make him gain weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been as low as 245, and I'm hoping to be 265 or 270 in
the future,'' Kearse said. ``I want to be stout at the point of
attack.''
</P>
<P>
   The more success Kearse has, the more attention he draws.
Opponents are using a tight end to help the tackle double-team him.
They also are keeping in a running back to chip-block Kearse. The
coaches have been countering lately by moving him to the other
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love that idea,'' he said. ``It works best for the team
because it frees me up or frees someone else up. It doesn't matter
to me who makes the play. The only thing that matters is that we
win. This season has been a lot of fun. Those teams that passed me
up can see I'm having the time of my life in Tennessee.''

Faster-paced NBA packs plenty into still-young season
<TEXT>
<P>
   By MICHAEL MURPHY
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   The NBA season is only at the quarter pole _ or thereabouts _
and we've already had more action than in all of last season's
lockout-squeezed schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries have forced an All-Star team of talent to miss large
portions of the season, and two coaches have bitten the dust for
one reason or another.
</P>
<P>
   Word around the Alamo City is the Spurs have gone from
contenders to contenters, playing without the fire and enthusiasm
that typified their charge to the 1999 NBA championship, the first
in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   And their opponents in the Finals, the New York Knicks, are once
again a case study in family dysfunction. The Portland Trail
Blazers, everyone's preseason darlings, won't go 82-0, even though
there were some who (almost) jokingly hinted they might.
</P>
<P>
   There have been the requisite surprises (Danny Ainge walking
away from a talent-rich Phoenix team? Miami one of the top-scoring
teams in the league? Seattle nine games over .500? Philadelphia at
.500 despite playing without Allen Iverson for 10 games?) and
disappointments (Minnesota at 7-12? New Jersey 6-17? Detroit 11-12?
Washington 7-17?).
</P>
<P>
   But at least it's been fun to watch, unlike last year's root
canal of a season.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to rule changes, scoring is way up, and (almost) everyone
wants to run. Phil Jackson is adding a few more decimal points to
his win percentage, only this time with the 19-5 Los Angeles
Lakers. Shaquille O'Neal, who has finally added rebounding and shot
blocking to his duties with the Lakers, is looking like the next
Most Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, though, we've said goodbye to Charles Barkley,
who blew out a tendon in his knee, ending a storied, but ringless,
career.
</P>
<P>
   But on the plus side, we haven't had to deal with Dennis Rodman.
Yet.
</P>
<P>
   It's been interesting, hasn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Especially for New York and San Antonio, last season's Eastern
Conference and Western Conference champions, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Patrick Ewing, the Knicks are again the city's most
popular dope opera. Ewing, who had missed a big chunk of the season
recovering from the torn left Achilles' tendon he suffered in last
season's Eastern Conference finals, finally returned to the lineup
last week.
</P>
<P>
   But Ewing wants to be the star of the show, not a supporting
player, causing a rift on the team. And when the media ask him
about it, Ewing gets churlish about everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just tired of it, so tired of all the garbage here,''
Ewing said. ``With everything that's happened the last couple of
years, maybe I've overstayed my welcome here. Some days I think
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed playing in New York. I've given my heart and soul to
this team. I've got a lot of basketball left in me. But I'm tired
of all the other stuff that goes with playing here.''
</P>
<P>
   The intrigue is just as thick in San Antonio, where the Spurs
have struggled, despite their 17-7 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our biggest problem is the adjustment period,'' said
David Robinson of being the defending champs. ``We're not trusting
each other and we're not helping each other. So a lot of our
problems are just reading each other and trying to play together.
As we watch the tape, it becomes more increasingly obvious that
we're not trusting each other yet.''
</P>
<P>
   But you can trust us. Here are the hottest topics around the
league at the quarter pole:
</P>
<P>
   Trade rumors _ The NBA's trade season opened Wednesday, but
there wasn't a flurry of activity. Yet. But everyone's talking, and
some of the names being discussed are interesting:
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who needs a power forward who can knock down the
16-foot jumper, would love to get the grossly overpaid Juwan ``Dr.
Do Little'' Howard from Washington. Going to Washington would be
the usual Lakers CARE package of Glen Rice, Robert Horry and Travis
Knight to offset Howard's $15 million salary.
</P>
<P>
   Rice will be asking for $14 million next year, and few teams
think he's worth it, but they don't want to alienate David Falk,
Rice's agent, by refusing to grant the rich extension.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls would love to unload Toni Kukoc, who apparently has
medical history's first recorded case of terminal back spasms.
Kukoc, who hasn't played since Nov. 9, is rumored to be waiting for
this season to end so he can head back to Europe and not have all
these NBA demands placed on him. Like play defense. And they say
Scottie Pippen couldn't take following in Jordan's footsteps. At
least Pippen sat out only 1.8 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The Timberwolves have fallen off the NBA map despite the
presence of Kevin Garnett and Terrell Brandon, losing seven
straight. So the T-Wolves (in sheep's clothing) are looking to dump
Brandon, who signed a $54 million extension last season. Brandon is
on the outs supposedly because he provides little, if any,
leadership. Interested parties include the Raptors, Warriors and
Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics are willing to part ways with ``Employee No. 8'' _
Antoine Walker, perhaps packaging him with Vitaly Potapenko.
Nobody's interested in having Walker punch their time clock,
however, given his tough-guy behavior and a shooting touch that is
less accurate than Barkley's drives on the local fairways.
</P>
<P>
   In the worst-kept secret in the league, Philadelphia is shopping
Larry Hughes. The perception is Sixers coach Larry Brown can live
with Iverson or Hughes, but not both. Rumored offers include the
Raptors' Tracy McGrady (who turned down a contract extension) and
the Nets' Kerry Kittles, who practically has a blue light flashing
beside him _ that's how eager the Nyets are to get rid of him and
his bum knees _ or Kendall Gill, depending on who's reporting the
rumor.
</P>
<P>
   But talk is the wish list Brown sent to Santa has the Mavericks'
Michael Finley at the top. And you know Mavericks coach/general
manager/guru Don Nelson could do something that stupid.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks would be willing to part with Charlie Ward or Chris
Childs, perhaps even both. Brandon is the apple of the Big Apple's
eye, but Minnesota general manger Kevin McHale wants shooter deluxe
Allan Houston in return. The Knicks have politely declined.
</P>
<P>
   Golden State, which got a ``no thanks'' when they offered Mookie
Blaylock to Minnesota for Brandon, is shopping Donyell Marshall. A
possible destination is New Jersey for Kittles or Gill, who has one
year left on his contract. Some reports have Gill, apparently the
``Zelig'' of trade talks, headed to Cleveland for Wesley Person.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks are interested in moving Isaiah Rider, even though
he's been playing the best ball of his career. Rider, in the last
year of his current deal, wants a fat extension, hence the solid
play. But the Hawks, wary of Rider's troubled history, believe if
they give him the new deal, he'll go haywire again.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone interested? Yep, the Nets, who are offering _ who else? _
Gill, who must be in the Greensheet.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries _ How about a roster that includes Iverson (broken
thumb), Kobe Bryant (broken hand), Barkley (knee), Hakeem Olajuwon
(hernia), Ewing (Achilles' tendon), Tim Hardaway (knee), Brian
Grant (knee), Paul Pierce (ankle) and Kukoc (back yeah, right)?
</P>
<P>
   Those are just the biggest names that have taken the pause for
the gauze.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavaliers have taken a big hit by Zydrunas Ilgauskas'
continuing foot problems, the Golden State Warriors are waiting for
Erick Dampier to get back from a knee injury and the Heat only
recently got Otis Thorpe back from his broken right thumb.
</P>
<P>
   Hot Rod Williams still hasn't played for the Mavericks because
of his bad back and Hersey Hawkins had his streak of 527 straight
games played end last Friday when he tore his left calf muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches in the crosshairs _ Danny Ainge stepped down in Phoenix.
Brian Hill was stepped on Thursday in Vancouver. Who's next?
</P>
<P>
   Don Casey in New Jersey, who would no doubt pay his own way out
if that rumored trade for Rider goes through. All you need to know
about Casey's chances are the Nets now have Yankees boss George
Steinbrenner as a partner. Yeah, Casey's packing his bags right
now.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers' Chris Ford, who watched his team score three
points in the second quarter against the Lakers this week, an
NBA-record low. Three points? If he wasn't fired after that, then
Ford has to be safe.
</P>
<P>
   P.J. Carlesimo in Golden State. Heck, the owner probably will
choke him if the Warriors keep losing the way they have.

   LOS ANGELES _ Question 1 of the Great American TV Quiz: When NBC
combines forces with cable partners CNBC and MSNBC next September
to televise the Sydney Summer Olympic Games, they'll force upon the
good ol' USA a staggering 435 hours of coverage. How many of them
will be as-it-happens live?
</P>
<P>
   a) 435.
</P>
<P>
   b) 201.
</P>
<P>
   c) None.
</P>
<P>
   The correct answer, of course, is...
</P>
<P>
   Did we mention this was (begin ital)NBC(end ital) doing the
event?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is, of course, zilch.
</P>
<P>
   Not because there's an impossible time difference to deal with.
Los Angeles is 18 hours behind Australia _ meaning if it's 8-to-11
p.m. prime-time window here, it's 2-to-5 p.m. the next day with the
sun ablazin' there.

co-chairman and long-time network sports TV exec Dennis Swanson
tried to explain Thursday, is because it makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   To advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really doesn't do any good to take the major events in an
Olympics and run them in hours when no one can see them,'' said
Swanson, who flew in to L.A. from New York for NBC's announcement
Thursday at the Western Cable Show at the L.A. Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time shifting can put the most visible and desirable sports at
the peak of prime time, when most can get in front of a TV. There's
a reason why the World Series isn't in the afternoon anymore. Prime
time is where they have the biggest audience.''
</P>
<P>
   And...
</P>
<P>
   ``And advertisers want maximum viewership,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But at least the World Series is live.
</P>
<P>
   CNBC, which forces its way into 71 million homes, and MSNBC,
limping along in another 51 million homes (but hopefully more after
this announcement), will combine for 172 hours of ``original''
programming over 18 days. Please note, it's the first time coverage
of an Olympic Summer Games will be on cable TV.
</P>
<P>
   And because MSNBC will carry preliminary rounds of the men's
soccer match on Wednesday, Sept.13, it'll mark the first time
American TV coverage of an Olympiad will begin on cable.
</P>
<P>
   Since MSNBC will also show 101 hours of repeat broadcasts from
midnight-to-7 a.m. on weekdays and midnight-to-6 a.m. on weekends
(or when it's prime-time in Sydney). That makes 273 hours of cable
filler to go with 162{ hours on NBC's over-the-air channel.
</P>
<P>
   True, it does mean viewers from the '96 Games in Atlanta who
felt slighted by overlooked coverage of the entire boxing
competition as well as all the games of the U.S. women's softball
and soccer teams will be appeased this time around.
</P>
<P>
   It just won't be... do we have to say it again?
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a time and distance discrepancy that I don't think
bothers the viewers as much as it seems to bother the newspaper
writers who devote so many column inches to this issue over the
year,'' said Jim Lampley, hired back by the network to host MSNBC's
Olympic studio show. (Live, we should add).
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole time-frame issue is something viewers are quite
accustomed to making accommodations for, either to watch the event
knowing what already happened, or as something that helps them
maintain a willing suspension of disbelief.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Pat O'Brien, the former long-time CBS Sports employee who
returns to host the CNBC side of it: ``I think people accept it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of things in life we accept, true.
</P>
<P>
   Death, taxes and tape-delayed Olympics on NBC will always be a
threesome.
</P>
<P>
   No loyalty oath required: Neither Lampley nor O'Brien envisioned
they'd be working on an Olympic event again, but all of the sudden,
the two who used to work together at KNX-Channel 2 about 10 years
ago (O'Brien as a news anchor and Lampley as the sports guy) are
sharing a summer down under.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been some Olympics done without me, but not enough
of them,'' said Lampley, the current HBO boxing broadcaster who'll
undertake his 10th Olympic assignment. He was the late-night
co-host for NBC's past two Olympics (Atlanta and Barcelona) and
worked for ABC (on five Games, including Los Angeles), CBS
(Albertville) and Turner Sports (Nagano).
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the last thing I expected after my contract with NBC
dissolved a few years ago,'' he said. ``I knew NBC had the next 12
years of Olympics and because I'd be at HBO, I figured that'd be
the end of that. Now, out of the blue, I'm back in it. I'm sure
Juan Antonio Samaranch was saying, `We've got to find a way to have
him involved.'''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said he'd planned to go to Sydney anyway with ``Access
Hollywood.'' He says putting on an NBC blazer after all his years
at CBS won't creep him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even sure NBC people wear blazers, but if they do,
I'll wear it,'' said O'Brien, who hosted CBS' entertaining
late-night studio show from Albertville in '94. ``This is a great
way to come back.''

SALLEY MAKES CONTRIBUTION FOR LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's generally accepted as fact that the Lakers won't
go far without acquiring a bruising big man to back up Shaquille
O'Neal. John Salley thinks they've already got one.
</P>
<P>
   Salley seemed to prove his point Thursday, ably filling in for
the foul-plagued O'Neal and holding the Lakers together long enough
to pull out a 95-88 victory over the Atlanta Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   Playing a season-high 20 minutes in relief, Salley scored seven
points and contributed a blocked shot, two rebounds, four fouls and
some nifty passing out of the high post.
</P>
<P>
   Unspectacular, but effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felt like I'm worth my money now,'' Salley quipped. ``I had to
make up for that Houston game (when O'Neal was suspended and Salley
started).''
</P>
<P>
   Salley can't give the Lakers what O'Neal does, but he sees his
role simply: ``Make something happen. Get a tip, get a rebound, get
a pass, foul hard, block a shot, score when the opportunity's
there. Play basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   And for those who believe the Lakers desperately need another
big man?
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are called critics, and I don't pay attention to
critics,'' Salley said. ``Phil (Jackson) knows. Basketball people
know what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Good eye: Derek Fisher had a contact lens knocked out of his
right eye when he caught a Dikembe Mutombo elbow and had to play
the last 1:59 of the game with one contact.
</P>
<P>
   He managed to make one of two free throws and grab a steal
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely split vision _ one good eye, one bad eye,'' he
said. ``But I had to go to the free-throw line and at least make
one of those free throws.''
</P>
<P>
   He shot with both eyes open, creating some blurred vision,
rather than shoot one-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about it, but I figured I have a better chance with
(both eyes), a 75 percent chance of going in, instead of just 50.''
</P>
<P>
   Dispute: Lakers second-year guard Tyronn Lue is one of 16
defendants named in a $30 million lawsuit filed by agent Eric
Fleisher, according to a report in the Rocky Mountain News of
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher is accusing a former business associate, agent Andrew
Miller, of essentially poaching his clients to start his own firm.
Lue, a Miller client, is one of six NBA players named in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Miller called the allegations ``absolute fiction.'' Lue declined
to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Lue, on the injured list with a sore left knee,
said he's feeling better, and he expects to begin practicing again
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Travis Knight will be eligible to be activated from the
injured list after tonight's game, but Jackson said that's
unlikely, barring an injury to another Laker big man.

DISNEY VOWS TO DELIVER CHRISTMAS GIFTS ON TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Dave McNary  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Los Angeles) -- DisneyStore.com, seeking to set itself apart
from widespread stumbling by Internet retail rivals, announced it
will guarantee delivery before Christmas on orders made as late as
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``DisneyStore.com has met the challenges of this important
e-holiday season,'' said Russ Gillam, senior vice president of
e-commerce for Disney's Go.com portal site. ``We're thrilled our
careful preparation and superior technology will enable us to serve
all those last-minute shoppers.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, which extended the previous pre-Christmas
order deadline six days forward, comes amid reports of poor
customer service, inventory problems and lagging delivery times at
Web sites across the Internet. Some merchants have cut off standard
ground deliveries this week while others have warned that they
cannot guarantee delivery by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult for first-time players on the Web to manage
these issues so we wanted to show we have not had problems,''
Gillam said. ``We are enjoying benefits of our massive investment
in upgrading our inventory and delivery system so we're able to
manage quadrupled growth in our business.''
</P>
<P>
   Burbank-based parent Walt Disney Co. has invested heavily in
Internet business such as DisneyStore.com. During the 1998 season,
Gillam said, orders to the retail site usually were delivered in
three or four days but the company decided to upgrade its
distribution system and opened a state-of-the-art
500,000-square-foot warehouse in Jonesville, S.C., in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did reasonably well last year, but we recognized the
importance of giving customers rapid turnaround and reliability,''
Gillam said. ``It mandated making the investments we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillum said the site, which has more than 3,000 items for sale,
has seen stronger than expected business for personalized items
such as towels and clothes. The South Carolina facility includes 35
embroidery machines.
</P>
<P>
   Among the top sellers is the ``Toy Story 2'' Undercover Buzz
Lightyear with Infrared Remote Control, which retails for $25.

HOLLYWOOD GETS IT WRONG IN `MAGNOLIA'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Dennis McCarthy  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If ever a movie should come with a neon warning label, it's the
film ``Magnolia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Warning _ if you've believed all the hype and think you're
about to see a movie depicting real life in Los Angeles' San
Fernando Valley for the vast majority of people who live here _
turn around, go home, and watch a rerun of the `Brady Bunch'
instead.''
</P>
<P>
   They're both about as realistic, you'll save $7, and at least
you won't feel like you need a shower after watching the ``Brady
Bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Magnolia'' bombed big time with the people I took to see it
Wednesday night at a screening at Warner Bros. studios _ the people
who know the real Magnolia Boulevard and North Hollywood areas
better than anyone because they're out there on those streets every
day.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Bogart, a Los Angeles police patrol officer from North
Hollywood Division; Guy Weddington McCreary, who grew up in North
Hollywood about 10 miles north of downtown Los Angeles and is the
great grandson of the man who developed the area; and Lori Dinkin,
president of the Valley Village Homeowners Association, near North
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   They all take serious issue with the film's director, Paul
Thomas Anderson, who told Los Angeles Daily News Film Critic Bob
Strauss that he wanted to make ``the epic, the all-time great San
Fernando Valley movie.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't. Not even close. It's a three-hour root canal. A minus
four stars, these people say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that picture is supposed to represent the vast majority of
life in the Valley _ heaven help us all,'' McCreary said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there are people who will think it is great, but I
walked out of the theater thinking, Whew, thank God my life isn't
like that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like that'' is a steady stream of life's losers bombarding the
audience for three hours with reams of perfunctory, loud profanity,
cocaine snorting, women hating and a little child abuse thrown in
just for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   It makes Anderson's last movie, ``Boogie Nights'' look like
``Toy Story.'' Trust me. You don't want to take Grandma to see it.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Bogart took his grandmother Wednesday night. I've
never seen a person squirm that much outside of a dentist's chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw `Boogie Nights,' so I knew the director's work, and told
my grandmother it might not be a good movie for her to see,''
Bogart said. ``She wanted to go, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very uncomfortable throughout the whole movie, and so
was she. She asked me after the movie if people really talked like
that, and I told her no, that was the extreme, and it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (police officers) deal with a lot of tragedy, death and
destruction on the streets, but nothing like the kind of personal
tragedy this movie tried to portray in its characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was magnified 10 times from any kind of reality,'' he said.
``It's certainly not the Magnolia Boulevard I work on everyday as a
police officer.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is what angers these people more than anything. The
movie may have excellent acting, may even carry a message, if you
want to wade through a three-hour headache and frogs' guts to find
it. But, in the end, it's a fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's being sold as the Valley's movie, and that's an insult to
everyone living here,'' said Dinkin, president of the Valley
Village Homeowners' Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of young and old people, all generations, living
here, and nobody even remotely close to them was portrayed on the
screen. Where were the normal people?
</P>
<P>
   ``The director showed only the worst of the losers. Maybe that's
the only people he knows, but it's not the people we all know, not
the Valley I see out on my streets everyday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This movie wasn't about the Valley, it was about the ugly side
of life anywhere in this country,'' she said. ``It's three hours of
pure garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   A downer, McCreary calls it. ``It would be pathetic if that
really was the Valley.'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there will be those who will read this and think we
just don't get it, but that's the sad part,'' McCreary said. ``We
do get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This picture is a sad, sick commentary on our society, and who
wants to spend $7 and waste three hours to see that?''

LA-AREA HIGH SCHOOL FORGES A TREATY OF UNITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Sherry Joe Crosby  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Los Angeles) _ Hoping to quell a long-standing feud between
Latino and Armenian students at a high school in the Los
Angeles-area community of Valley Glen, teens have crafted a peace
accord that aims to defuse tensions and build harmony among all
students on the ethnically diverse campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The treaty represents our hopes and faith for peace,''
Principal Joe Walker said Thursday.``The cooperative agreement is
symbolic of a spirit that we want at Grant High School.''
</P>
<P>
   In late October, long-simmering tension between Latino and
Armenian students at the 3,700-student campus exploded into
violence that left several students injured and brought police in
riot gear.
</P>
<P>
   The five-point agreement, which was created with help from a
community outreach program of the U.S. Department of Justice, urges
teens to talk out their differences, prevent individual disputes
from spreading throughout the campus and calls for student leaders
to meet once a month to discuss the effectiveness of the accord.
</P>
<P>
   Still in draft form, the document will go into effect in
mid-January when students return from winter break and will be
posted throughout the campus in hallways and classrooms for all
students to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it as rules for people to follow,'' said Enrique Gomez,
18, a peer mediator who worked on the document.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators said the agreement is key in the school's ongoing
efforts to provide a safe campus for all students. Grant already
offers an array of programs that seek to imbue students with
communication skills and an appreciation of multiculturalism and
diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agreements like this will help all students to feel that they
can contribute and be responsible,'' Assistant Principal Mel Rosen
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, there have been verbal understandings (between
students). But this solidifies the cooperation and we think it will
be beneficial to all students.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the peace accord is designed to dissolve conflicts
between all students _ not just those of Armenian and Latino
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement doesn't speak to Armenian or Hispanic
students,'' Walker said. ``This treaty is for all students in the
school.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarik Smith, an English teacher who oversees the school's peer
mediation program, said the agreement is a pledge to create a safer
campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a physical testament to promoting goodwill and mutual
respect between different groups,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Students familiar with the document said they hope it produces
positive changes on campus but realize greater efforts are needed
to bring about long-lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, peer mediators and advisers from the district's
Youth Relations and Crime Prevention office organized a softball
game on campus last weekend that drew about 25 to 30 students of
various races and ethnicities.
</P>
<P>
   Students said such extracurricular activities are helping to
melt barriers between teens of different races and ethniticies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're friends right now,'' said Arutyan Avakov, 16, an
Armenian student referring to his Latino classmates. ``We talk. We
hang out.''
</P>
<P>
   The school also has been visited by representatives of the city
and county human relations commissions and the district's
Intergroup Relations Office.
</P>
<P>
   But students said they realize the only hope for peace rests
with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave them some trust and we're getting it right back,''
Gomez said.

PET SNAKE KILLS ASPIRING ZOO KEEPER
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- An aspiring zoo keeper who kept 10 deadly snakes
and six piranhas as pets in her mobile home in suburban Los Angeles
was killed by one of the two most deadly snakes in her collection,
authorities said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Anita Finch, 33, was found dead in her mobile home by a friend
and the lot manager Wednesday evening. Charlene McMorris, manager
of the Vicabob Trailer Park Village at 7560 Woodman Place, Van
Nuys, said her tenant loved her snakes and feared city inspectors
would confiscate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is, she died for her snakes so they wouldn't take
them,'' McMorris said. ``She has been bitten at least four times
before, and she knew if she called for help they would be taken
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Police and coroner's officials confirmed a snake killed her,
ruling out foul play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first case I've seen to die from a snake bite,'' said
Los Angeles County Coroner's spokesman Scott Carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``She got bitten by one of the deadly snakes, went into
convulsions and died,'' said Los Angeles Police Sgt. Lisa Phillips
of the Van Nuys Division.
</P>
<P>
   McMorris said she knew the snakes were illegal to keep but never
forced her tenant to get rid of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would have been devastated if I did that,'' McMorris said.
``Maybe I should have called animal control, but that would have
killed her. I always thought that if she got hurt, I would remove
them while she was in the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Animal control officers removed 12 snakes two that were not
dangerous and the six piranhas, said Dan Knapp, general manager of
L.A. Animal Control. ``She appeared to enjoy the danger and she
took her life into her hands,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McMorris said she picked up most of the snakes on Arizona and
High Desert roads. But the two snakes that might have killed her
are not indigenous to the United States and may have been purchased
illegally, Knapp said.
</P>
<P>
   Knapp said they believe the snake that killed her was a Gabon
Viper, a Central African snake that can grow to about 7 feet long
and 18 pounds. Finch's viper was only about a foot long, said
Carrier.
</P>
<P>
   But coroner's officials have not ruled out that another snake,
called the Hog-Nosed Sand Viper, may have delivered the deadly
bite.
</P>
<P>
   Puncture marks were found on the back of her hand, which was
severely swollen, Carrier said.
</P>
<P>
   When police found her, a note was clenched in her hand that
read: ``Northridge Hospital -- Ask for ICU,'' Carrier said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only surmise she was attempting to seek help but was
not able to do so because whatever happened, happened so
suddenly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Animal control officers killed the 10 venomous snakes and
delivered the heads to the Coroner's Office to determine which one
bit the woman, Carrier said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Sand Viper and the Gabon, the eight snakes destroyed
were: a 3-foot Western rattler; two 4-foot Eastern diamondback
rattlers; a South Pacific rattlesnake, considered extremely rare;
one King snake; a gopher snake; and two copperheads. Six piranha
also were taken from a fish tank, Carrier said.
</P>
<P>
   Finch had been a longtime volunteer at the Los Angeles Zoo and
was enrolled in the animal keeper's training course. She would have
taken her final exam this Saturday, in gaining employment
there, said Micahel Dee, general curator of the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``She loved reptiles and she loved to learn,'' Dee said. ``This
is devastating to us. She was one of our promising up-and-coming
students.'' Finch trusted her snakes so much that she would let
them loose as she cleaned their cages, McMorris said. She believes
Finch was searching for a missing snake because her home was turned
``upside down,'' with the refrigerator moved and pans scattered
around the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'd say `I'm immune to them.' She was not afraid of them,''
McMorris said.

FIRMS RIDING LINUX TO SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Just say the word ``Linux'' these days and it's
good for at least a 10 percent run-up in your company's stock
price.
</P>
<P>
   It may be short-lived, but several local companies have felt the
power of Linux in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   Even K-tel International Inc. -- yes that K-tel -- got a bit of
a Linux boost Thursday when it announced the switch of its Internet
servers to a Linux-based system. The news pushed the suburban Los
Angeles-based music company's stock above $10 per share for a time
before it settled in to close at $9.71875 per share, a 4.17 percent
increase over its Wednesday close.
</P>
<P>
   K-tel said in a written statement the Linux operating system it
purchased from Red Hat Inc. will speed its servers and allow more
people to use its Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   Also riding the Linux bubble was National Technical Systems,
which told investors Thursday it now has the capability to test the
operation of Linux-based software and hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Investors responded by buying the company's shares -- lots of
them. More than 1.6 million NTS shares changed hands Thursday,
though the average daily volume is closer to 18,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the rapid increase in the use of Linux operating systems
across the nation, we have seen a strong demand for conformance
testing procedures to ensure compatibility,'' said William
McGinnis, executive vice president of NTS.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that two other local firms which recently pledged their
allegiance to Linux and are watching their stock prices soar. On
Monday, Chatsworth-based MRV Communications and Newbury Park-based
Pacific Softworks both saw their stock prices increase sharply
after announcements from both companies regarding their forays into
products designed for Linux systems.
</P>
<P>
   Linux is an operating system that is gaining popularity as an
alternative to Windows. It was developed by Linus Torvalds, who was
a student at Finland's Helsinki University when he enlisted the
help of more than 1,000 programmers across the world to develop the
system.
</P>
<P>
   Once it was completed, Torvalds made the source code --
essentially the heart and soul of the software -- available for
free on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   While companies such as Red Hat Software and VA Linux Systems
have ridden initial public offerings to meteoric stock price
increases, Torvalds hasn't pulled in riches from Linux -- though he
owns some shares of VA Linux Systems.

USC'S LOSS ANGERS BIBBY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH _ USC coach Henry Bibby was so disgusted after the
Trojans' 76-66 loss to Long Beach State before 2,739 at the Pyramid
on Thursday night, he made the team drive back to Los Angeles
immediately after the game and watch films of the setback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys didn't play,'' Bibby said. ``Sam Clancy played and David
Bluthenthal played for a half and that's it. We didn't play smart
or with structure. It was incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   USC (5-5) led 39-37 at halftime, but scored just 27 points in
the second half and shot 24 percent in the final 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Brian Scalabrine scored just four points, 12 below his
average, and fouled out in only 27 minutes of action.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a downer for us,'' Bibby said. ``We had come
off a couple good wins. I thought we didn't want to win. You can't
just show up.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't an ideal situation for the Trojans to play such a dud,
considering the game was televised on ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Even USC's leading scorer, Clancy, struggled. He scored 19
points but was 5 for 18 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I couldn't make an outside shot,'' Clancy said. ``We
seemed out of sync the whole night. They just wanted it more than
we did.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss is particularly damaging because the Trojans don't seem
to be getting much better than they were at the start of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   They were unable to stop Long Beach's frontcourt, as 6-foot-11
center Mate Milisa had 15 points while forwards James Williams and
Antrone Lee each scored 14.
</P>
<P>
   USC's bench was also an issue. Bibby used it sparingly, but the
reserves scored only two points.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby acknowledged that the Trojans were in a near no-win
situation before the game the Trojans played like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough game to play,'' Bibby said. ``They have
everything to gain from a win. It's not an automatic win. We have
to go down and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Bibby added, ``It's a must game for us too.''
</P>
<P>
   Bluthenthal scored a career-high 19 points for USC, but only two
in the second half. He supplied most of the offense for the Trojans
in the first half, scoring 17 points, including three shots from
3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   But the rest of the Trojans were not nearly as effective in the
first half. Clancy scored eight points but made just 3 of 9 shots.
Shooting guard Jeff Trepagnier made 3 of 8, and had six points.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a 36-29 lead, the Trojans were outscored by Long
Beach 8-3 over the final 4:11.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans led by as many as nine points twice in the half.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Bluthenthal paced USC, hitting two 3-pointers
and scoring eight points as the Trojans took an 18-11 lead with
12:17 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   His tip-in and two free throws then gave the Trojans a 22-15 as
he scored 12 of USC's first 22 points.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby did not substitute until 10 minutes into the game, when he
inserted point guard Rashad Jones. But Jones lasted only one minute
after committing a foul and turnover.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the game, Bibby set four goals for the Trojans: ``I
want to see us play better defense, rebound the basketball, make
free throws, execute the offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: USC forward Jarvis Turner, who is out with a stress
fracture in his foot, will see a doctor next week, but is not
expected to begin practicing until Christmas. That would mean the
earliest he could return is Dec. 29 against Northwestern, USC's
final game before Pac-10 play begins.

REPORT: DODGERS WON'T LOSE BELTRE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A television report late Thursday said the Dodgers
would be fined for signing third baseman Adrian Beltre, but the
club would not lose him to free agency.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Sports News said an announcement would come Monday from
Major League Baseball stating the Dodgers wouldn't lose the
20-year-old Beltre, signed at 15, because the statute of
limitations expired. Beltre was signed more than five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But that rule may come down to an interpretation. A rule states
a player has one year to file for a grievance after the claim is
made, baseball officials said. According to representatives of the
player's association, that date was in late March when Beltre and
his agent, Scott Boras, first discovered Beltre was signed
illegally. Players must be 16 to sign a contract.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone nor Boras could be
reached for comment. Dodgers officials said Thursday evening they
hadn't heard a ruling from the commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
   If Beltre isn't declared a free agent, Gene Orza, the associate
general counsel for the players association, said he expects the
union to file a grievance. Boras echoed those sentiments numerous
times.
</P>
<P>
   The issue would move in front of an independent arbitrator,
which could take until late January to make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Malone said regardless of what the ruling was, the Dodgers would
move forward based upon it and not worry about appeals or
grievances.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alderson, executive vice president of baseball operations
for the commissioner's office, is handling the investigation. He
said during the weekend that all interviews were finished, but he
still needed to talk with commissioner Bud Selig about the issue.
Selig will make the final decision.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre hit .275 with 15 homers, 67 RBI and 18 stolen bases in
his first full season with the Dodgers. If he's declared a free
agent, he could make as much as $550 million over seven years,
industry insiders believe.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were fined $200,000 during the season after an
investigation led to a pair of Cuban-born Dodgers minor-leaguers
being declared free agents because the club broke baseball rules in
signing them.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ After listening to a candidate's speech at a Communist
Party campaign forum here before Sunday's national vote to elect a
new parliament, 76-year-old Yevgenya Mikhailovna eased herself out
of the seat in the musty old theater and headed for the exit.
</P>
<P>
   The retired bookkeeper struggling on a $40-a-month pension shook
her head as she prepared to step outside into the blowing snow.
``They have the smell of mothballs about them,'' she said,
gesturing toward the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Vladimir Putin ``really inspires confidence and
respect,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's military offensive in Chechnya, a popular war so far,
has stirred in many Russians a rare thing: confidence in the
government, led by the 47-year-old Putin.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 million Russians are eligible to participate in
Sunday's vote across the country's 11 time zones to elect a new
450-member Duma. But the election's real significance is as a
marker toward an even bigger race to replace President Boris
Yeltsin as president in mid-2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows this campaign is a dress rehearsal for next
summer's vote. Russians take this election seriously, but they've
come to see all the factions as more or less corrupted. The
promises don't mean much. Instead they're looking for
personalities, not ideologies,'' said pollster Yuri Levada.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's most popular personality these days is Putin, who was
handpicked for the job by Yeltsin four months ago. His name is not
on the ballot Sunday, but his mark will be all over the results.
Putin's strong image as a leader invested wholly in the war in the
breakaway Chechen republic has altered the contours of Russian
politics. A decent showing among pro-Kremlin parliamentary
candidates Sunday could solidify his advantage in the presidential
sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six political parties and some 2,400 candidates _ from
Marxist ideologists to former gangsters, capitalist tycoons to
alleged criminals seeking immunity _ are vying for the Duma, the
lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a bitter battle, heightened by the significance of
the upcoming presidential race. The make-up of the parliament is
important, but it pales in comparison to the immense power of the
presidency under Russia's current constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin's opponents had hoped the parliamentary election
results would reflect a resounding rejection of Yeltsin's failed
reform policies and his erratic leadership. The country's deep
economic distress and the taint of Kremlin-involved banking
scandals, they hoped, would pave the way for a new populist party
formed earlier this year and mean greater gains for the leading
opposition party, the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Chechnya foiled that game plan. It altered the
campaign agenda from economics and corruption to war and
patriotism. Virtually every leading politician backed the Chechen
offensive and those who dared to question it were publicly
denounced as disloyal.
</P>
<P>
   If the polls hold true in Sunday's balloting, the new Duma will
look much like the current one. The Communist Party will win retain
its leading but not controlling bloc of about 140 seats, faring as
they did in the 1995 elections with about 20 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kremlin may emerge with something equal, according to
some polls. The Unity Party was literally invented by the Kremlin
just a few months ago and stocked with an odd assortment of
candidates. From nowhere, it has drawn its popularity by
association with the tough-talking Putin and his war against
Chechnya's Muslim separatists.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive in Chechnya has dominated the news and restored a
sense of national pride after Russians suffered a humiliating
defeat there in the 1994-96 war. It also turned Putin from an
unknown into an idol, with a job approval rating was near 80
percent among Russians. This, for a man whose name barely
registered in August.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Putin's public approval ratings are the highest of any
Russian politician since those his boss, President Yeltsin, in his
heyday in 1991, when he led the democracy drive that helped topple
the Soviet regime. Today, however, Yeltsin is mired in the single
digits amid the economic turmoil, corruption scandals and his
chronic health lapses.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-Kremlin party's gains have come at the expense of two
other presidential aspirants, former Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov and Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov. They teamed up earlier this
year to form the Fatherland-All Russia bloc, who in most polls has
dipped to third place.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Primakov was the leading prospect for president,
based on polls. But he and Luzhkov have taken a beating from
pro-Kremlin media owned by a group of wealthy tycoons _ known as
the oligarchs _ who helped Yeltsin defeat his Communist rival,
Gennady Zyuganov, in the 1996 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Primakov, 70, was targeted by a vicious ad
campaign suggesting he was past his prime. The billboards and
leaflets wished the able-bodied Primakov a happy birthday, but
showed only a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov, a popular mayor with extensive and shadowy business
ties, has been portrayed as corrupt _ including a suggestion that
he was linked to the murder of a prominent American businessman,
Paul Tatum, who was gunned down in a dispute over the control of a
luxury hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Both Primakov and Luzhkov have accused Yeltsin's aides of dirty
tricks, including attempted bribes to Fatherland-All Russia Party
members to withdraw from the election.
</P>
<P>
   Four months ago, it was widely assumed that the Fatherland-All
Russia Party would offer voters an attractive third way _ not the
old policies of the Soviet-era Communists, and not the unbridled
capitalism of Yeltsin ``reformers'' that has made the vast majority
of Russians poorer than they were a decade ago. Just a month ago,
it was even with the Communists in polls, with about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If Sunday's results mirror the pre-election surveys, analysts
say the Kremlin will have achieved just what it wanted _ derailing
Primakov's presidential bid before it ever got started and assuring
that the Communists remain the key, but still ineffective,
adversary in the Duma.
</P>
<P>
   But measuring the political temperature in Russia is not so
simple. And a Kremlin victory in Sunday's elections may not mean
much in January is Russian troops become bogged down in Chechnya,
or suffer heavy losses such as the more than 100 soldiers
reportedly killed in an unsuccessful assault on Grozny last week.
</P>
<P>
   Putin and Primakov are proof that a lot can change in four
months.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Primakov's high popularity ratings were said to be
a sign of the country's need for a ``father figure'' and a steady
force amid the traumatic changes Russia has endured in this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Putin's popularity _ three separate polls show him leading
his nearest rival by an almost 3-to-1 margin if the presidential
race were held today _ stems from the notion that the nation likes
a ``strong hand'' pressing a war that many Russians feel is
necessary to bring order to its southern border, and to show the
world that it will not bow easily to international pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the mercurial results reflect a weary Russian
electorate disenchanted with democracy and an ailing, out of touch
president. They are hungry simply for a solid leader that will
actively guide the nation through troubled times.
</P>
<P>
   In the Duma races, despite the large number of parties seeking
seats, only a handful will gain a place in parliament. Under
Russia's election laws, half of the 450 seats are set aside for
candidates running in individual districts while the other half are
allocated to national party lists based on how the parties finish
in the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   To gain a place in parliament, a political party must receive at
least 5 percent of the overall vote. Only four parties qualified in
the 1995 elections.
</P>
<P>
   If opinion polls prove correct, the Communists should lead the
way, with the pro-Kremlin Unity Party and the Fatherland-All Russia
Party roughly dividing the seats that had been held by the 1995
pro-Kremlin party, Our Home is Russia.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ After listening to a candidate's speech at a Communist
Party campaign forum here before Sunday's national vote to elect a
new parliament, 76-year-old Yevgenya Mikhailovna eased herself out
of the seat in the musty old theater and headed for the exit.
</P>
<P>
   The retired bookkeeper struggling on a $40-a-month pension shook
her head as she prepared to step outside into the blowing snow.
``They have the smell of mothballs about them,'' she said,
gesturing toward the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Vladimir Putin ``really inspires confidence and
respect,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's military offensive in Chechnya, a popular war so far,
has stirred in many Russians a rare thing: confidence in the
government, led by the 47-year-old Putin.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 million Russians are eligible to participate in
Sunday's vote across the country's 11 time zones to elect a new
450-member Duma. But the election's real significance is as a
marker toward an even bigger race to replace President Boris
Yeltsin as president in mid-2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows this campaign is a dress rehearsal for next
summer's vote. Russians take this election seriously, but they've
come to see all the factions as more or less corrupted. The
promises don't mean much. Instead they're looking for
personalities, not ideologies,'' said pollster Yuri Levada.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's most popular personality these days is Putin, who was
handpicked for the job by Yeltsin four months ago. His name is not
on the ballot Sunday, but his mark will be all over the results.
Putin's strong image as a leader invested wholly in the war in the
breakaway Chechen republic has altered the contours of Russian
politics. A decent showing among pro-Kremlin parliamentary
candidates Sunday could solidify his advantage in the presidential
sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six political parties and some 2,400 candidates _ from
Marxist ideologists to former gangsters, capitalist tycoons to
alleged criminals seeking immunity _ are vying for the Duma, the
lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a bitter battle, heightened by the significance of
the upcoming presidential race. The make-up of the parliament is
important, but it pales in comparison to the immense power of the
presidency under Russia's current constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin's opponents had hoped the parliamentary election
results would reflect a resounding rejection of Yeltsin's failed
reform policies and his erratic leadership. The country's deep
economic distress and the taint of Kremlin-involved banking
scandals, they hoped, would pave the way for a new populist party
formed earlier this year and mean greater gains for the leading
opposition party, the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Chechnya foiled that game plan. It altered the
campaign agenda from economics and corruption to war and
patriotism. Virtually every leading politician backed the Chechen
offensive and those who dared to question it were publicly
denounced as disloyal.
</P>
<P>
   If the polls hold true in Sunday's balloting, the new Duma will
look much like the current one. The Communist Party will win retain
its leading but not controlling bloc of about 140 seats, faring as
they did in the 1995 elections with about 20 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kremlin may emerge with something equal, according to
some polls. The Unity Party was literally invented by the Kremlin
just a few months ago and stocked with an odd assortment of
candidates. From nowhere, it has drawn its popularity by
association with the tough-talking Putin and his war against
Chechnya's Muslim separatists.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive in Chechnya has dominated the news and restored a
sense of national pride after Russians suffered a humiliating
defeat there in the 1994-96 war. It also turned Putin from an
unknown into an idol, with a job approval rating was near 80
percent among Russians. This, for a man whose name barely
registered in August.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Putin's public approval ratings are the highest of any
Russian politician since those his boss, President Yeltsin, in his
heyday in 1991, when he led the democracy drive that helped topple
the Soviet regime. Today, however, Yeltsin is mired in the single
digits amid the economic turmoil, corruption scandals and his
chronic health lapses.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-Kremlin party's gains have come at the expense of two
other presidential aspirants, former Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov and Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov. They teamed up earlier this
year to form the Fatherland-All Russia bloc, who in most polls has
dipped to third place.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Primakov was the leading prospect for president,
based on polls. But he and Luzhkov have taken a beating from
pro-Kremlin media owned by a group of wealthy tycoons _ known as
the oligarchs _ who helped Yeltsin defeat his Communist rival,
Gennady Zyuganov, in the 1996 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Primakov, 70, was targeted by a vicious ad
campaign suggesting he was past his prime. The billboards and
leaflets wished the able-bodied Primakov a happy birthday, but
showed only a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov, a popular mayor with extensive and shadowy business
ties, has been portrayed as corrupt _ including a suggestion that
he was linked to the murder of a prominent American businessman,
Paul Tatum, who was gunned down in a dispute over the control of a
luxury hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Both Primakov and Luzhkov have accused Yeltsin's aides of dirty
tricks, including attempted bribes to Fatherland-All Russia Party
members to withdraw from the election.
</P>
<P>
   Four months ago, it was widely assumed that the Fatherland-All
Russia Party would offer voters an attractive third way _ not the
old policies of the Soviet-era Communists, and not the unbridled
capitalism of Yeltsin ``reformers'' that has made the vast majority
of Russians poorer than they were a decade ago. Just a month ago,
it was even with the Communists in polls, with about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If Sunday's results mirror the pre-election surveys, analysts
say the Kremlin will have achieved just what it wanted _ derailing
Primakov's presidential bid before it ever got started and assuring
that the Communists remain the key, but still ineffective,
adversary in the Duma.
</P>
<P>
   But measuring the political temperature in Russia is not so
simple. And a Kremlin victory in Sunday's elections may not mean
much in January is Russian troops become bogged down in Chechnya,
or suffer heavy losses such as the more than 100 soldiers
reportedly killed in an unsuccessful assault on Grozny last week.
</P>
<P>
   Putin and Primakov are proof that a lot can change in four
months.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Primakov's high popularity ratings were said to be
a sign of the country's need for a ``father figure'' and a steady
force amid the traumatic changes Russia has endured in this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Putin's popularity _ three separate polls show him leading
his nearest rival by an almost 3-to-1 margin if the presidential
race were held today _ stems from the notion that the nation likes
a ``strong hand'' pressing a war that many Russians feel is
necessary to bring order to its southern border, and to show the
world that it will not bow easily to international pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the mercurial results reflect a weary Russian
electorate disenchanted with democracy and an ailing, out of touch
president. They are hungry simply for a solid leader that will
actively guide the nation through troubled times.
</P>
<P>
   In the Duma races, despite the large number of parties seeking
seats, only a handful will gain a place in parliament. Under
Russia's election laws, half of the 450 seats are set aside for
candidates running in individual districts while the other half are
allocated to national party lists based on how the parties finish
in the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   To gain a place in parliament, a political party must receive at
least 5 percent of the overall vote. Only four parties qualified in
the 1995 elections.
</P>
<P>
   If opinion polls prove correct, the Communists should lead the
way, with the pro-Kremlin Unity Party and the Fatherland-All Russia
Party roughly dividing the seats that had been held by the 1995
pro-Kremlin party, Our Home is Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Reform-minded liberals from the established Yabloko Party of
Grigory Yavlinsky and the newly formed Union of Right Forces should
gain a small number of seats, but manage to cross the 5-percent
threshold.
</P>
<P>
   No single party will hold a 226-seat majority, and how a ruling
Duma coalition may be aligned is anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   There has been little debate over the issues, but the major
parties generally agree on the need to simplify the tax code and
none _ not even the Communist Party _ is advocating printing money
to get Russia out of its current economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are witnessing a war between forces that differ very little
in their views and programs,'' said Yevgeny Yasin, an analyst and
former economic minister.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Russia's fledgling democracy remains primitive and its
election process is flawed.
</P>
<P>
   However, amid the dirty campaign tactics and political disarray,
there are positive signs, say analysts. Foremost, is the mere fact
that free parliamentary elections are taking place for the third
time in eight years after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

<P>
   ``The most remarkable event is that this vote is not a

in 1,000 years of Russian history.''

<P>
   &UR; By TED ROSE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Y2K was born on Monday, June 12, 1995, at 11:31 p.m. It was
delivered in the middle of an otherwise unintelligible e-mail, a
contribution to an Internet discussion group of computer geeks
exploring the millennium bug long before most people were surfing
the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The efficiency of the term is undeniable--``Y'' for ``year,''
the number ``2,'' and ``K'' for ``thousand'' (from the Greek
``kilo'')--and it eventually caught on.
</P>
<P>
   But its creator remained unidentified until just over a year
ago, when someone performed the equivalent of a computer paternity
test by searching the discussion group's archives for the term's
first use.
</P>
<P>
   The father of the phrase is a 52-year-old Massachusetts
programmer named David Eddy, who's now the president of a Y2K
consulting business. ``People were calling it Year 2000, CDC
(Century Date Change), Faddle (Faulty Date Logic),'' Eddy says.
``There were other contenders. (Y2K) just came off my fingertips.''
</P>
<P>
   But what made Y2K flourish while its siblings withered. S.B.
Master, who runs a naming company called Master-McNeil (great
name!) and who has helped name products for clients including Sun
Microsystems and 3Com, performed her own ``linguistic analysis'' of
Y2K and promptly listed six reasons why the term holds such appeal.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, she said, Y2K is efficient, since it uses just
three characters; similarly structured acronyms such as IBM, NBC,
and GTE are a staple these days.
</P>
<P>
   Second, it's gratifyingly symmetrical, with the two consonants
hugging that number in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Third, the whole tradition of combining letters and numbers is a
venerated techie convention (think R2D2 and C3P0). The date-glitch
issue has obvious technical associations; thus there is a strong
connection between the term's appearance and its meaning.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that explains why we're not using, say, Y2M--which
simply replaces the consonant representing the Greek term for
thousand with the one for ``mille,'' its Latin counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K, Masters pointed out, is rhythmically superior. When Y2K is
analyzed as poetry, one sees a satisfying alternation of long and
short syllables: a diphthong (Y), followed by a monothong (2), and
a final, concluding diphthong (K). By contrast, Y2M ends with a
redundant monothong. Masters praised Y2K for its superior sound
production, noting that the term features an elegant plosive
progression, moving from soft (Y) to hard (2) to hardest (K). Y2M
retreats lamely with a soft ``M.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Masters lauded the term for the way its articulation
produces a satisfying movement to the inside of the mouth. The term
begins with a labial sound: the ``Y'' being formed with the lips.
The ``2'' is alveolar; it is produced at the middle of the mouth
when the tongue touches the roof. Finally, the ``K'' is velar,
forming in the back of the mouth. That progression sets Y2K far
apart from its competition.

 &HT;    Dogs' Evans quells doubts
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ According to Georgia coach Jim Harrick, only about
15 percent to 20 percent of junior college transfers contribute
significantly in their first season in a Division I-A basketball
program. Fewer than that make what is considered an impact on their
new team.
</P>
<P>
   Harrick shared that theory with Anthony Evans in their first
conversation upon the forward's arrival on campus from Neosho
County (Kan.) Community College this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me which percentage did I fall into _ the ones that
take a year or the ones that make an impact?'' Evans said this
week. ``I told him, `I can make an impact.' There wasn't any doubt
in my mind about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not in Evans' mind, but there was considerable doubt among
many others, Harrick included. While no one seemed to question
whether Evans would be a useful player in the SEC and ACC, few
predicted the overwhelming success that he has experienced his
first two months at Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Saturday's game at Marshall, the 6-foot-7, 265-pound
forward from Decatur is the Bulldogs' second-leading scorer (16.9
points per game) and top rebounder (10.3). With 18 points and 11
rebounds in Georgia's 68-67 upset victory against Wake Forest last
Saturday, Evans recorded his fifth consecutive ``double-double'' in
points and rebounds. He also leads the team with 10 steals.
</P>
<P>
   Evans' numbers are not the product of soft competition. They've
come against Wake Forest, Georgia Tech, Louisville, Kansas and
North Carolina State. What's more, Evans is putting them up against
defenders who usually stand 3 to 6 inches taller.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea we were getting what we got,'' Georgia's Harrick
said. ``He's exceeded all my expectations. I've always felt junior
college players needed a year before they really contribute.
Watching him in practice, I knew he could do it against our guys.
But he's been able to do it against everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans' scoring knack is the product of three attributes: great
hands, strength and quickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him he could make millions of dollars in the NFL as a
tight end,'' said Jeff Guiot, Evans' junior college coach at Neosho
County. Indeed, Evans was a favorite target of Georgia quarterback
Quincy Carter while the two were at Southwest DeKalb High. But
Evans injured a knee and gave up the sport after his junior season.
</P>
<P>
   What Evans lacks in height, he makes up for in strength and
girth. He's the consummate wide body and he knows how to use it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Guiot did a good job of teaching me how to use my body
and seal off,'' said Evans, whose NBA idols include Charles Barkley
and Larry Johnson. ``He used to bang me with these pads. He'd push
me just as I would go up for a shot. He told me I was always going
to be going up against 6-9, 6-10 guys, night in and night out, so I
might as well get used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans does everything quickly on the court _ moving his feet,
getting off his shot, jumping for rebounds, throwing the outlet
pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a special knack, a special talent,'' Harrick said.
``He's got great hands. He's very quick with the release on his
shot. And he's got the greatest outlet pass of anybody I think I've
ever coached. He can rebound the ball and throw the outlet pass to
the guard in one motion. Our team is starting to sense that and
reacting to it pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans' outlet pass was best displayed against Wake Forest. His
half-court pass after a Demon Deacons basket with 3.8 seconds set
up the winning 3-point shot by Adrian Jones.
</P>
<P>
   With Georgia's trip to Marshall, Evans' basketball career has
come full circle. Had Evans qualified for freshman admission after
high school, he said he likely would have signed with the
Thundering Herd, who gave him his first in-home visit. Marshall,
Mercer and Georgia State were his most vigorous pursuers at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   But after his two seasons at Neosho, Evans was holding
scholarship offers from Arizona State, Kentucky and Tennessee as
well as Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew coming in people had doubts about me, about my
height,'' Evans said. ``But I always believed in my heart I could
play in the SEC, ACC, anywhere in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, everyone else is starting to believe, too.

   No one seems to want to have fun with the Y2K bug
</P>
<P>
   By Phil Latham
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ Gee, what with this Y2K thing, nobody has a
sense of humor anymore.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, I've been working on the local manager for
Southwestern Electric Power Company for some time now. All I want
him to do is, exactly one minute after midnight on Jan. 1, 2000,
flick the lights for a couple of seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Would that be a hoot, or what? And yet, for some reason, he
absolutely refuses to consider my request.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, those stick-in-the-muds at the financial institutions
won't hear my suggestion that, a few minutes after midnight, they
set some of their ATMs to begin spewing $1 bills. Would that really
cost much compared to the fun it would produce? I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think that the ``bug'' in the Y2K was affecting our sense
of humor, not a computer chip. Do we all lose the ability to laugh
in the coming millennium? I hope not, because I have a feeling that
laughter is going to be more important in the days ahead.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to chuckle, think of Y2K as God's little joke on
humans to show us that we aren't quite as smart as we think we are.
In the span of roughly 40 years computers entered our lives, took
them over our to the point of becoming indispensable, then almost
became obsolete because of the ticking clock.
</P>
<P>
   How's this for funny: One hundred years ago, give or take, the
highest technology for getting water was a hand pump drawing it
from a well. With all our amazing technology, though, if the Y2K
bug isn't fixed, we'll be wishing for hand pumps and buckets.
</P>
<P>
   So I say we all lighten up. Bug or no bug, there isn't much
likelihood that anyone is going to die of thirst or hunger, even if
every computer on the face of Earth refuses to work on Jan. 1,
2000. High blood pressure from stress and worry, though, that's
another matter.
</P>
<P>
   So even if we can't get the electric utility to cut the power _
and we probably won't get city to turn off the main water tap,
either _ we can all have a little fun of our own, right?
</P>
<P>
   So at that New Years' Eve party, you can locate the breaker box
yourself and give everyone a quick charge of darkness at the
appointed time.
</P>
<P>
   Or how about going to the host in a not-so-quiet voice and
asking him, ``Why in the heck won't your toilet flush and who's
been taking Metamusel?'' The host might even pay you to do that if
he wants to clear out his guests.
</P>
<P>
   The fun goes beyond the scatological.
</P>
<P>
   If you happen to be going to one of those parties where people
drink too much, I suggest going out on lawn just after midnight,
pointing to the sky and shouting, ``They are here! They are here!''
</P>
<P>
   If the people are really drunk you could just wobble around and
ask if anyone else is feeling the earthquake. Better make sure the
toilets really are working before you try that one.
</P>
<P>
   On New Year's Day, take a bunch of bananas back to your grocer
and tell him that they can't be peeled and are obviously not Y2K
compliant. Spouses who don't want to cook can say that the can
opener no longer works. Don't want to do the cleaning? Simple, have
you checked the mop to see if it is Y2K compliant? I'm guessing
that it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   The only way I'm going to be upset on Jan. 1 is if I discover
that my pink recliner isn't Y2K compatible. I've already done
extensive testing, but I intend to do much, much more.

 &HT;    Deaths spell injustice
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ In 20 years of working with battered women, Nancy
Grigsby has never seen anything like it.
</P>
<P>
   Nine Miami Valley women have been murdered since June 1998,
suspected victims of domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   The Artemis Center for Alternatives to Domestic Violence has
lost five clients. ``What's going on here?'' asks Grigsby, the
agency's director. ``We've seen a huge escalation in domestic
violence homicides.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzie Thompson's murder by a Warren County Jail inmate
mistakenly let out for Thanksgiving furlough is only the most
outrageous example, Grigsby says, of what she sees every day: the
failure of the criminal justice system to protect battered women,
even against offenders with a long history of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of our mission is to change the community in which our
clients live, and I don't think we have done that,'' Grigsby says.
</P>
<P>
   William Chapman served time in a state prison for domestic
violence. He was jailed again after making harassing phone calls to
Thompson, violating his parole. Even though state parole officers
ordered him kept behind bars, he was granted a one-day furlough
after Warren County Sheriff Tom Ariss failed to tell Judge Dallas
Powers about the hold order.
</P>
<P>
   It gets worse. For most of the six days Chapman was on the
loose, nobody bothered to look for him.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson called the jail Nov. 29 to report that Chapman was
harassing her again. She was told that Chapman was still in jail.
(The computer system failed to tag him as absent.)
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 30 _ the day before Suzie Thompson died _ a deputy filed
an escape charge in Lebanon Municipal Court. But even then,
according to court documents, a perfunctory phone call was the only
attempt to bring Chapman back to jail.
</P>
<P>
   Unbelievable?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a more direct version of the homicides we see every
day,'' Grigsby says. ``The common thread is the failure to perceive
danger, to see things through the eyes of the potential victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Armanthua Beckwith, mother of six, was slain Nov. 1 after coming
off her shift as night custodian at Wogaman Elementary School in
Dayton. Her accused killer, Eric Fleming, is being held in lieu of
$1 million bond. When it might have mattered _ when it might have
saved Beckwith's life _ Fleming got every break in the book.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Fleming threw Beckwith to the ground and threatened her
with a knife. Despite four witnesses to the violence, the
prosecutor reduced the charge from a first-degree to a
fourth-degree misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day Fleming was sentenced in that case, he was
arraigned on charges stemming from a Sept. 14 stabbing during which
he threatened to kill Beckwith. He was sentenced to 30 days,
including time served, in the first attack, and his bond was
reduced from $25,000 to $2,000 in the stabbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here you have three people who didn't get it _ the prosecutor
who reduced the case, the judge who didn't reject the plea, and
another judge who reduced the bond,'' Grigsby says. ``They missed
every opportunity to make sure he was in custody.''
</P>
<P>
   Grigsby is disheartened: ``After all these years of convening
task forces, writing protocols, relationship-building, and training
our butts off, and here we sit, looking at a list of dead
clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Ginsburg of Artemis Center puts it more bluntly: ``Here
we have victims saying, `Hello?' This guy is going to kill me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``When are we going to listen?''
</P>
<P>
   As far as Thompson and Beckwith are concerned, never.

 &HT;    I'd write a longer letter if I weren't so modest
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Folks:
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's time again for the annual report on adventures and
accomplishments of the Minter family, which I know all of you have
been anxiously awaiting.
</P>
<P>
   It also is easier and cheaper than addressing Christmas cards
and licking all those stamps you have to stand in line at the post
office and spend half a Social Security check to get.
</P>
<P>
   We would have a lot more to tell if we hadn't spent so much of
the year in international travel. The Marco Polo lady was able to
find a real bargain on a tour of Australia, New Zealand, the Fiji
Islands, a stop in Hawaii, and a few other places I can't recall.
Not counting all the nifty made-in-China souvenirs we bought in
Australia, the trip didn't cost all that much more than our first
house.
</P>
<P>
   Because we were in the air for several days and about 100,000
miles, we earned so many Frequent Flier points we may never be able
to spend more than two nights at home in the next several years.
Thanks to our massive accumulation, Mrs. Christopher Columbus was
able to arrange a bonus trip to France in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   You won't believe this, but we actually made money on that one.
Thanks to our hard-earned Frequent Flier points, we had to pay only
$39 each for our tickets. Shortly after we got home, the airline
sent both of us a $100 voucher, along with apologies, for the three
hours we spent at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris waiting for
Curley and Moe to change a tire. That put us $122 ahead, although I
think we spent more than that on the bribes we had to pay to use
restrooms.
</P>
<P>
   We're real proud of all those stamps from different countries we
can show off when we match passports with fellow travelers, or swap
itineraries with friends in Peachtree City and North Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The technical highlight of my year was learning to use e-mail.
I'm sure lucky I never got serious about golf, because I wouldn't
have time. Answering e-mail takes seven or eight hours a day, not
counting the 30 or 40 minutes it takes to get hooked up to wherever
it is you have to get hooked up to. When you get on e-mail,
everybody you know and even total strangers send you dozens of
jokes about Bill and Hillary, philosophical essays, excerpts from
books and how to enjoy better sex. According to estimates of some
experts, e-mail has cut productivity in this country about 89
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Our in-house fat control officer discovered a great new magazine
on healthy living. We now know 50 secrets of how to fight bulges
without dieting; how to stop the aging process by eating grape seed
and pine bark; how to drop cholesterol 100 points in 21 days by
eating Chinese red yeast and butter made from yogurt; and how to
live happily with an overactive bladder, even when you are
traveling in France.
</P>
<P>
   Although I violated a direct order and planted a rather large
garden, our marriage seems to have bumped through another year,
saved by the weather. A windstorm blew down most of the Silver
Queen just when it was ready to be frozen and put up for the
winter. Thanks to the drought, a lot of butterbeans didn't fill
out, and wilt reduced the tomato crop so much that canning never
became an issue.
</P>
<P>
   We enjoyed another season following the Georgia Bulldogs and
their exciting victories over Central Florida, Vanderbilt, LSU and
either Idaho State or Utah State, I forget which. Even though
Florida beat us again, it's always nice to spend an afternoon in
Jacksonville getting drenched in a warm tropical rain. The Tech
game was a bit of a disappointment, but I think we could have won
if either the officials or the coaches had stayed home.
</P>
<P>
   In October I celebrated another birthday I didn't really expect
to have. We also survived numerous trips to Atlanta and down to
Macon on Interstate 75 without being run down and crushed by an
18-wheeler trying to break the sound barrier. We didn't have any
more stray cats to take up with us.
</P>
<P>
   Our granddaughter, going on 15 and looking forward to her
learner's license, is still the prettiest, smartest, best-behaved
teen-ager we know. In fact, our entire family is just super smart
and successful, not to mention being real modest. Since we might
make other parents feel bad, we try not bring up all the fantastic
accomplishments our boys continue to enjoy in their personal and
professional lives.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, 1999 was another great year, in spite of drought,
tomato wilt, an army of Japanese beetles, a record infestation of
fire ants, 120-degree heat in the Australian Outback, a flare-up of
arthritis in my left knee, nasty telephone calls from Georgia Tech
fans, Chinese yeast, yogurt butter and French restaurants that
won't let you use the restroom without ordering a five-course meal
and a bottle of wine.
</P>
<P>
   We hope you and yours have enjoyed an equally good year, and are
looking forward to many, many more _ as I am now that we're stocked
up on grape seed and pine bark.
</P>
<P>
   Until next year. ...

 &HT;    Giving customers what they want: Restaurant servers get wise to
the ways of popular high-protein regimens
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The customers order 14-ounce filets and salads loaded
with blue cheese dressing. But as soon as they say ``no croutons,''
Jennifer Wooten knows they're on a diet.
</P>
<P>
   Not a carrots-and-Fresca kind of diet, but one of those
high-protein diets.
</P>
<P>
   For Wooten, a waitress at the upscale Lenox Square steakhouse
Prime, knowing the ins and outs of high-protein dieting is key to
success on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people are deciding what to order, I can tell right away
they're on the Atkins diet,'' Wooten says. ``I'll ask them, and
nine times out of 10 it's that one or another.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as Protein Power.
</P>
<P>
   Such as the Zone.
</P>
<P>
   Such as Sugar Busters.
</P>
<P>
   Although these fad diets differ in their particulars, all have
the same basic message: ``yes'' to proteins, sometimes ingested in
Conehead-esque excess, and ``no'' to carbohydrates, sometimes
prohibiting even a bite of carrot, a pinch of sugar or a lonely
crouton. Nutritionists, despite their reservations, admit that the
diets can effectively peel away the pounds in the short run.
</P>
<P>
   And, strangely enough, these weight-loss programs have been a
boon to the high-end restaurant biz, eager to supply all the prime
steaks, chops and cheese a high-protein dieter could hope for.
</P>
<P>
   Wooten guesstimates that ``someone's doing that diet at just
about every other table _ perfect, skinny little Buckhead ladies
and big businessmen who can't eat sushi because they're watching
their figures. It's definitely the buzz; everyone's talking about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wooten knows exactly how to steer these diners _ toward plain
sashimi rather than rice-sullied sushi, away from salads that have
sugar in the dressing _ and she hustles the bread basket away
before the dieters can give in to temptation. ``They're all pretty
happy when a waiter or waitress knows what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   All over town, the cream of Atlanta's service corps is hip to
the protein diet. ``It's pretty easy to detect,'' says Ryan Turner
at Food Studio in Atlanta. ``When I hear `Can you sub the mashed
potatoes for something else?,' I'll ask them if they're on
Atkins.''
</P>
<P>
   Daryl Elder at Canoe in Vinings has heard the no-mashed-potatoes
request ``so many times'' that he's lost count. ``They ask for a
steak with just sauteed greens or asparagus.''
</P>
<P>
   David Abes, chef at Insignia in Sandy Springs, Ga., knows the
steak-and-spinach order well, and he notes that his customers are
``cutting out a lot on the bread.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the prototypical high-protein diet has been around
for years _ Robert C. Atkins originally published ``Dr. Atkins'
Diet Revolution'' in 1972 _ it wasn't until he rejiggered it in
1997 (``Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution'') that it became a
national phenomenon and spurred a host of competitors.
</P>
<P>
   In New Orleans, where a group of doctors first published ``Sugar
Busters!'' several years ago, restaurants have long been keen to
diners who want their steaks sans potatoes. Places as tony as the
Grill Room at the Windsor Court Hotel offer menu items specially
sanctioned by ``Sugar Busters!''
</P>
<P>
   But in Atlanta, it wasn't initially so easy for Mary Sorrel to
eat out when she brought the diet back from New Orleans in
mid-1998. Sorrel, a partner in an Atlanta public relations firm,
says, ``I'd get a strange look from the waiters at Mick's when I'd
order a hamburger without the bun.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past six months, though, the diets have picked up so much
steam that even chain restaurants now pose no problems.
</P>
<P>
   John Magnuson, a specialty food and wine wholesaler on the
``Protein Power'' plan, recently tried to navigate the menu at
Houston's. The waiter immediately recognized that he was on a
high-protein diet and steered him away from the balsamic
vinaigrette dressing, which contains sugar.
</P>
<P>
   But Magnuson says he doesn't feel deprived on the diet. ``Last
night we had dinner at McKendrick's and had a huge strip steak,
bibb lettuce salad with Maytag blue cheese dressing and a copious
quantity of red wine,'' he recalls with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a definite shift,'' says Wooten, the waitress at
Prime. ``It's bring on the steak. Bring on the cream. Bring on the
bearnaise.''
</P>
<P>
   And even among regulars. ``There's this one woman who's very
prominent in Atlanta,'' says Wooten, ``who went suddenly from just
eating low-fat carbs to all sashimi and steak and salad with the
dressing on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Has she lost any weight?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' laughs Wooten, ``She's just the same, but she seems
happier.''
</P>

 &HT;    Fad or find? Books detail diets
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Heart Association has issued a statement
criticizing high-protein diets. Nonetheless, they top the charts of
the diets in vogue. Here are books about the most popular versions.
</P>
<P>
   Though high-protein diets have been criticized by the American
Heart Association and other health groups, they top the charts
among diets in vogue. Some books describing the most popular
versions:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution'' by Robert C. Atkins (Avon
Books). Unlimited amounts of protein and fat, severe restriction of
all carbohydrate-containing foods.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Sugar Busters!'' by H. Leighton Steward, Morrison C. Bethea,
Sam S. Andrews, Ralph O. Brennan and Luis A. Balart (Ballantine
Books). Less restrictive than Atkins in carbohydrate intake, as
long as all white starches and sugars are avoided. More restrictive
caloric intake.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Zone'' by Barry Sears with Bill Lawren (HarperCollins).
</P>
<P>
   All meals and snacks based on 40 percent carbohydrate, 30
percent protein and 30 percent fat.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Protein Power'' by Michael R. Eades and Mary Dan Eades
(Bantam Books). Similar to the Atkins program: very low in
carbohydrates and very high in protein. Works in two phases.

 &HT;    New joinery book helps the woodwoker get it together
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Joinery Shaping &AMP; Milling,'' another new book from
The Taunton Press, is one that deserves a place in every student
woodworker's library alongside the same publisher's classic ``Tage
Frid Teaches Woodworking'' series.
</P>
<P>
   The 202-page softcover book is no more than a collection of
articles from Fine Woodworking magazine, but the whole is far more
than its parts.
</P>
<P>
   I see it alongside Frid's books, which any longtime reader knows
I revere, because it compliments them.
</P>
<P>
   It updates the techniques to include new tools and new
techniques, and elaborates on many of the standard ones.
</P>
<P>
   The book begins at the beginning of any woodworking project _
getting the stock square. An excellent article discusses means of
dealing with every defect known to a plank. It's followed by
articles on jointing edges on a jointer or a table saw, and
flattening a board by hand with a jointer plane and a scraper.
</P>
<P>
   The article on resawing on a band saw, especially the section on
setting up and tuning the saw, is the best I have read on the
subject, and it concerns itself entirely with the saw most of us
have _ the 14-inch Delta.
</P>
<P>
   The long section on curved wood is comprehensive. It spends
plenty of time on the standard methods of steaming and bent
lamination, but it also goes very thoroughly into coopering, using
a vacuum veneer press, and even bricklaying segments to build up a
hollow circular frame. There is a fascinating article by one fellow
who uses a common drug store heating pad and a wet towel instead of
a steaming tube to prepare wood for bending.
</P>
<P>
   The latter half of the book is devoted to shaping and joinery.
There are extensive articles on using the biscuit joiner and the
router for almost anything.
</P>
<P>
   A long section has articles on every method known for making the
mortise and tenon joint, certainly the most important joint in
woodworking. Every kind of mortising machine is discussed, and
there is even a fine article on making your own mortise miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joinery'' is part of the publisher's ``Essentials of
Woodworking'' series, and I would certainly agree that it's
essential. It is, of course, handsomely designed and lavishly
illustrated with photographs and drawings.
</P>
<P>
   Its companion this fall in the same series is ``Finishes &AMP;
Finishing Techniques.'' For those who make a big thing out of
finishing, it is no doubt excellent, especially in its evaluation
of new water-based finishes. I checked to make sure it includes
something on the type of finish I use _ an oil varnish variety _
and let the rest of it slide.
</P>
<P>
   However, after almost 200 pages of chemistry and technique,
there's a one-page article that makes a pretty good case against
any kind of finish.
</P>
<P>
   These books sell for $17.95 each, a distinct bargain.

   FOR SATURDAY:
</P>
<P>
   LATHAM-COLUMN _ MARSHALL, Texas _ Gee, what with this Y2K thing,
nobody has a sense of humor anymore. (Latham, Marshall News
Messenger) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   MINTER-COLUMN _ FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ Dear Folks: Well, it's
time again for the annual report on adventures and accomplishments
of the Minter family, which I know all of you have been anxiously
awaiting. (Jim Minter is a former editor of The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ In 20 years of working with
battered women, Nancy Grigsby has never seen anything like it. Nine
Miami Valley women have been murdered since June 1998, suspected
victims of domestic violence. (McCarty, Dayton Daily News) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   FOR SUNDAY:
</P>
<P>
   GEEWAX-Y2K-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON _ As anyone who once bought an
eight-track tape player can attest, predicting the future of
technology is not for those who embarrass easily. Still,
forecasters keep looking down the road, doing their best to guess
where the new century will take us. While they differ about what
specific tools and toys will shape our tomorrows, prognosticators
do seem certain about one thing: Whatever we have, we'll have more
of it. (Geewax, Atlanta Journal-Constitution), 22.
</P>
<P>
   EDs: Moving in (k) commentary and (f) financial categories.
</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ There is much urgent mulling going on at high
levels and low over the prospect of applying state and local sales
taxes to ``remote'' retail trade _ that is, to catalog and Internet
commerce _ just as they are applied to store sales. This is a
no-brainer. There is simply no good reason not to charge routine
sales taxes. (Tom Teepen is national correspondent for Cox
Newspapers.) MOVED THURSDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ Just when I thought I was fully Y2K
compliant, I found out I wasn't. It was while writing a check to
the cable company that I noticed that the space for the date
concluded with 19; as in 1999 or 1901. I don't know about you, but
I order checks by the bale, printed with my name, address and part
of the date on it. (Howard Kleinberg is a columnist for Cox News
Service.) MOVED THURSDAY.
</P>
<P>
   GLASS-COLUMN _ Doctors are griping about health care plans that
jilt their patients to satisfy stockholders. By working in concert,
some doctors say, they would stand a better chance of putting
things back in sync. But that would break the antitrust laws. Some
politicians agree it's time to right the balance. (Andy Glass is a
columnist for Cox News Service in the Washington bureau.) MOVED

   COXNET SCIHEALTH 1218: MEDICAL MISTAKES - In medicine today,
it's the `buyer beware,' but you can take measures to protect

yourself from medical mistakes.

   HEALTH AND MEDIA - Publishers offer numerous books on mental
health. (Lee Kim, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) Art includes two
6-pica color photos of book jackets and 1 6-pica color illustration
of a computer.
</P>
<P>
   CYSTIC - Every night, Bill and Jerri Chesney tap their
children's chests, over and over again, to keep them from drowning.
Courtney, 8, and Taylor, 5, have cystic fibrosis (CF), a disease
that tricks the body into producing excess mucus, which coats the
pancreas and the lungs, inhibiting digestion and breathing. The
phlegmy superflux must be expelled daily, or the children will be
left gasping for air, like fish on dry land. (Browning, Palm Beach
Post) WITH PHOTOS. MOVED THURSDAY.
</P>
<P>
   LAMB-COLUMN - Even modern technology does not give without also
taking away. With every car, television and computer, humans have
moved farther away from the tribal societies and extended families
that once gave us a sense of belonging to a group. Every month,
some medical researcher expresses astonishment at how much a
person's social support has to do with his health and lifespan.
This essential ``connectedness'' refers to both the number of
relationships and the satisfaction they bring, but it boils down to
how much we share our lives with others. (Lamb, Dayton Daily News)

   LIFESTYLE
</P>
<P>
   CRACKER-AUTHOR - BAXLEY, Ga. - Writer Janisse Ray, whose first
book, ``Ecology of a Cracker Childhood,'' is winning praise from
environmentalists and reviewers, grew up in a Baxley junkyard in a
family cramped by poverty, mental illness and fundamentalist
beliefs. Her world widened when she went away to college and
graduate school, became an environmental activist and writer,
taught school in South America, lived in a hippie-style commune and
bore a child. Now, Ray and son Silas, 11, are back in Appling
County while she finishes her second book on rural communities.
They live in a rustic, 80-year-old farmhouse built by her
grandparents, often feeling lonely and isolated. While Ray and her
son struggle with the limits of a lifestyle she rejected, the move
back has allowed her to reach rapprochement with her father, who
caused much of her childhood pain.(Davis, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 75. WITH PHOTOS.
</P>
<P>
   WALTONS-CD - This Christmas, fans of ``The Waltons'' can get
even closer to the cast of the 1970s show with the CD ``A Walton's
Christmas.'' It was produced by Jon Walmsley, who played the gangly
Jason, andfeatures 19 tracks of holiday favorites, warm-fuzzy
recitations and chitchat betwn the actors, right down to the
mandatory bedtime mantra ``Good night 'Liv, good night John, good
night grandma, good night Erin, good night Ben . . .'' (Longino,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   WINNERS-QUIT - WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - Most folks, at some point
or another, have wanted to take their jobs and shove 'em. Tough day
at the plant, terse words with the boss, too much to do in too
little time. But what if you're a pampered pop star, admired
athlete or sitcom sensation? A beloved leader, respected writer or
lauded corporate bigwig? Would you be willing to chuck it all -
top-notch talent, tons of money, the world by the tail - if you
weren't happy? Or if you knew - even though you were at the top of
of your game - that it was time to bow out? (Grantham, Palm Beach
Post) MOVED

waiters are hip to the needs of diners. (Kessler, Atlanta

   RELIGION
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-ENDTIME - For 2,000 years Christians have been
expecting Jesus to return and the world as we know it to end. But
several hundred years before that, the Book of Daniel addressed the
end of the world. We look at prophecies over the years that have
been made - and not come to pass, religious movements that were
based on those predictions, and the modern theological arguments
over when, and how, the world will end. With timeline, glossary of
end-time terms, box detailing beliefs of other religions and list
of books, movies, etc. dealing with end-time themes. (White,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 50. WITH ILLUSTRATION and LAYOUTS.
</P>
<P>
   NEW-FAITH - AUSTIN, Texas - From fundamentalist to mainline
Christians, the words ''religion'' and ''religious,'' which many
believe synonymous with a church institution, are being cast aside
in favor of personalized spirituality. It's a dramatic shift, one
of the biggest of the millennium, according to some theologians and
scholars. What has evolved, mostly in recent decades, is a new
perspective on how faith can be practiced, leading to declining
membership in mainline denominations, religion-hopping and a
freestyle approach to faith that shows no signs of letting up.

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Strong social relationships important to good
health
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Even modern technology does not give without also
taking away. With every car, television and computer, humans have
moved farther away from the tribal societies and extended families
that once gave us a sense of belonging to a group.
</P>
<P>
   Every month, some medical researcher expresses astonishment at
how much a person's social support has to do with his health and
lifespan. This essential ``connectedness'' refers to both the
number of relationships and the satisfaction they bring, but it
boils down to how much we share our lives with others.
</P>
<P>
   Social connection is as important for doctors to measure as
weight, cholesterol and blood pressure, says Dr. Brooks S. Edwards,
medical editor of the Mayo Clinic Health Oasis Web site. ``The
strength of our relationships has great bearing on how well we age,
how well we deal with life's challenges and how well we survive
serious illness.''
</P>
<P>
   The subject most often involves the elderly, partly because
one-third of Americans older than 65 in private homes are living
alone and partly because the impact of connectedness is so dramatic
at their age. It's hard to ignore a five-year study of 1,400 heart
patients showing people who don't have a spouse or confidant are
three times more likely to die than those who do.
</P>
<P>
   But connectedness is also important for the young. When a
middle-school child's increased academic and peer pressures
converge with a torrent of hormones, stress levels soar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feeling connected just makes people feel more at ease,'' says
Ray Messer, a psychotherapist. ``You're OK. You don't feel as
anxious or worried, or get angry as much because you know you're
OK. That in itself relieves stress, and there are scientific
studies that show relieving stress strengthens the immune system.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Vonnegut, the acutely observant novelist, uses the term
``folk society deficiency'' for the ongoing outbreak of people who
lack a sense of connection or belonging. He compares it to vitamin
and mineral deficiencies, saying people waste away from FSD as
surely as scurvy patients lacking vitamin C.
</P>
<P>
   Often, he says, they ``become a member of an artificial extended
family.'' That isn't a huge problem if the symptom is wearing a
Cleveland Browns jersey to the fridge for the quick sandwich that
has replaced traditional Sunday dinners. But some artificial
extended families connect with each other by burning crosses on
front lawns or wearing black trenchcoats to school to conceal their
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Random violence occurs in part due to a lack of social
conscience,'' Messer says. ``Social conscience derives from social
commitment. Social commitment comes from the sense of belonging to
a group.''
</P>
<P>
   Messer got to thinking about the subject this fall, when his
seventh-grade daughter was moved out of the cluster of students who
had been grouped together in sixth grade and otherwise kept
together this year.
</P>
<P>
   In questioning the move unsuccessfully, he was bewildered that
the pleasant school officials he talked to had no apparent idea
they were discussing a significant problem with a simple solution.
Some kids naturally sink in the sink-or-swim environment of large
secondary schools, he says. ``But if kids are grouped with teams of
about 50 to 100 kids throughout their educational journey, there is
a stronger potential for interpersonal connection and group
loyalty.''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence among older adults shows those with good social
support are more likely to have optimum blood pressure and lower
rates of common colds, mental illness and age-related memory loss.
The support is believed to lower stress levels and to give people
more motivation to live healthfully.
</P>
<P>
   Connectedness deficiency is not something modern medicine is
equipped to treat, however. Doctors often worry that technology is
usurping humanity in their field, even as Hollywood movies
substitute special effects for character development.
</P>
<P>
   Even among psych professionals, it's hard to get past the
reality that reaching out to others is often quite stressful for
those who most need to do it.
</P>
<P>

information on building support systems at

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Medical RV to spread word about prostate cancer
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Thor Industries has begun a national tour in a
custom-built recreational vehicle to deliver free prostate cancer
screenings to 10,000 men older than 40 in upcoming months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason I'm alive today is because I was able to catch
the disease early enough to eradicate it,'' says Wade F.B.
Thompson, Thor's chairman and a prostate cancer survivor. He called
it ``the most difficult experience of my life'' and established
``The Drive Against Prostate Cancer'' to educate men and their
families about the importance of screening.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 180,000 American men are diagnosed each year with
prostate cancer and nearly 40,000 die. But it is virtually 100
percent curable if detected before it has spread from the prostate.
</P>
<P>
   The tour is targeting RV owners at RV shows and other public
forums, Thompson said, ``since so many RVers are over 40.'' Thor is
the second-largest manufacturer of RVs and the largest midsized bus
manufacturer in North America.
</P>
<P>
   All men 50 and older will be offered the screenings, as will
those 40 and older who are black or have a family history of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   The 39-foot Airstream medical vehicle has two private screening
rooms, where the 10-minute process will include a digital rectal
exam and prostate-specific antigen blood test from trained medical
staff.
</P>
<P>
   The tour's schedule of at least 15 cities is still being
assembled. Sponsoring partners are the Cancer Research Institute,
Endocare, Bayer Diagnostics and UroCor.

 &HT;    Choosing to quit the start of a new life for some
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Most folks, at some point or another,
have wanted to take their jobs and shove 'em.
</P>
<P>
   Tough day at the plant, terse words with the boss, too much to
do in too little time.
</P>
<P>
   But what if you're a pampered pop star, admired athlete or
sitcom sensation? A beloved leader, respected writer or lauded
corporate bigwig?
</P>
<P>
   Would you be willing to chuck it all _ top-notch talent, tons of
money, the world by the tail _ if you weren't happy? Or if you knew
_ even though you were at the top of of your game _ that it was
time to bow out?
</P>
<P>
   Geri Halliwell, better known as Ginger Spice, recently released
a book that claims, among other things, fame ain't what it's
cracked up to be. You'll recall that she made the globe (or at
least a lot of pre-teen girls) gasp when she dumped the Spice Girls
last year in search of serenity and a solo career.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan, who some argue had a decade of hoops left in
him, said in his retirement speech in January that he was leaving
pro ball ``to enjoy watching my kids grow up.'' This time, no
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   And last month, Julianna Margulies, head nurse Carol Hathaway on
``ER'' for six years, walked away from a $27 million contract _
landmark cash for a television actress _ to work in film and
theater.
</P>
<P>
   Quitting, my friends, is in.
</P>
<P>
   Not when you're about to get the gold watch and goodbye sheet
cake, but while you're still vibrant and/or young enough to revel
in your success and try something new.
</P>
<P>
   Or do nothing at all. Even if folks think you're nuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very serious trend across the board, whether it be
entertainers, athletes or executives,'' says Boston-based author
Mark Albion, whose book, ``Making a Life, Making a Living:
Reclaiming Your Purpose and Passion in Business and in Life,'' is
due out next month.
</P>
<P>
   (He also runs a support group for, get this, folks 30 and under
who've made at least $500 million, ``mostly dot-com money.'' There
are 12 men and two women, all filthy rich but unfulfilled.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Geri Halliwell was one of the unbelievable few who reached the
top of the mountain. But what you have to ask is, `Is this the
right mountain?' Sometimes you can only make that decision when
you're high enough to look down at the rest of your life and figure
out what's really important to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider actress Dolores Hart, who frolicked alongside George
Hamilton in ``Where the Boys Are'' in 1960. Three years later, she
canned Hollywood to join a convent in Bethlehem, Conn. Or running
back Jim Brown, third highest all-time rusher in the NFL, who _ at
age 30 with plenty of time left to play _ quit the Cleveland Browns
in 1965 to go to Hollywood. Predictably, his flicks flopped. But at
least Brown, who was inducted into the Football Hall of Fame in
1971, was brave enough to follow his bliss.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people sometimes have a challenge understanding is just
because you're working hard, doing well and making a lot of money,
that doesn't necessarily mean you love what you do,'' says Bob
Burg, motivational speaker and author of ``Winning Without
Intimidation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nor does it mean that you don't love what you do. But you may
reach a point where your decisions are based on different
criteria.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as redefined values, the need for a new challenge and the
realization that even the Sultan of Brunei's megabucks don't make
him immortal.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, money can't buy happiness. What it can buy, though,
is the freedom to quit so you can hunt elsewhere for it.
</P>
<P>
   And here, experts say, are the top three motivations for making
a change:
</P>
<P>
   _ A shift in values, such as putting family first or
volunteering to support a cause.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Barnes _ head of PepsiCo's North American beverage
business and one of America's highest-ranking female execs _
startled colleagues in 1997 with her eyebrow-raising move to become
a full-time mom to her three kids. And then there's poised Colin
Powell, the retired four-star Army general who was begged to accept
a GOP presidential bid after his stellar leadership during Desert
Storm. He decided, however, to forgo the White House for his own
house, where he sifts through stacks of mail bins deciding which
volunteer effort to endorse. Powell also has launched a lucrative
speaking career, in which he commands as much as $40,000 an
appearance. No desk, no daily hassle.
</P>
<P>
   Even Halliwell has hopped on a soapbox to promote, among other
issues, breast-cancer awareness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had always wanted to do something good with my public
standing,'' she writes in ``If Only,'' her autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   Some claim that the book is a cop-out, a whiny ``I had to find
myself'' excuse to deflect criticism that Halliwell was greedy and
self-absorbed. Perhaps. But she insists the price of fame was
``turmoil, insecurity and constantly being on display.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is about compassion and goodness and having a clear
conscience. Without these things it doesn't matter whether you're a
household name or a housewife because life will leave a bad taste
in your mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Career experts chuckle that celebrities oftentimes deem the
``price of fame'' too high after they've banked several million.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it still reflects a shift in values and goals,'' insists
Sharon Linzey, a sociologist in Newberg, Ore. ``From paycheck to
personal growth.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The need for a new challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan immediately comes to mind. What more could he strive for
after leading his team to six NBA titles? Sure, he still hawks
Hanes briefs, Ball Park franks, Nike shoes and the cologne that
bears his name, but there's nothing left for him to prove on the
basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   Same with legendary boxer Rocky Marciano, who left the ring in
1956 after eight years with a perfect 49-0 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know from a career standpoint I have accomplished everything
that I could as an individual,'' Jordan said in January after
shedding his Chicago Bulls jersey for the second time. (The first
time was in 1993 during a one-season stint at pro baseball.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, I feel great. Mentally, I am exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Joel Wilkinson, a consultant for careerexperience.com:
``One of the major reasons people quit at the top of their game is
that what they're doing no longer holds meaning for them because
the excitement and passion are gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, someone like Michael Jordan still has a passion for
sports, but if the challenge is gone, the thrill is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, however, that passion keeps athletes toiling for too
long, fans grouse, citing Muhammad Ali; Cal Ripken, still with the
Baltimore Orioles after a record 2,632 consecutive games; and
hockey great Wayne Gretzky, who finally called it quits in April
after two decades on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Thing is, the decision to split rests solely in the hands of the
athlete or actor or company president. Public opinion, harsh though
it may be, is no reason to quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's arrogant of others to judge when people are performing
past their prime,'' says Dr. Bruce Saltz, a Boca Raton
psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe there are more losses than wins or fewer goals scored or
not as many No. 1 hits, but that doesn't mean that person enjoys
playing the game any less or performing a song any less.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why does anybody quit anything? When the pain of doing it
outweighs the pleasure. To people on the outside, your choices may
seem ridiculous or incite ridicule. It takes enormous courage to
make decisions based solely on your own perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Take ``Catcher in the Rye'' author J.D. Salinger, who spent a
decade creating his 1951 classic. Then, he all but vanished in New
England, continuing to write but _ much to many perplexed fans'
dismay _ only for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Publishing was a vicious, vicious thing,'' he once said.
``There is peace in not doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The realization that life doesn't last forever, no matter how
rich and famous you are.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is when people come to grips with the fact that none of
us is sure how much time is allotted,'' says Sally Haver, president
of the Ayers Group, a New York-based human resources firm. ``They
think they can make a Tarzanlike swing from vine to vine and this
to that, and then, they go klunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as actress Shelley Long (Diane), who left ``Cheers'' in
1987 to raise the bar of her career, so to speak. Movies! Broadway!
Her own show! KLUNK.
</P>
<P>
   And actor David Caruso (Detective John Kelly), who blew off
``NYPD Blue'' in 1994 for the bright lights of Tinseltown. He made
two movies: ``Jade'' and the aptly titled ``Kiss of Death.'' KLUNK.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they were bored or greedy or egomaniacs or all of the
above. Regardless, career experts say, you gotta give them credit
for taking the leap.
</P>
<P>
   After all, there are always infomercials.
</P>
<P>
   Says Albion: ``At the point you realize you're mortal, you also
come to understand that we're all born with little marching orders
in our pockets. Sometimes you have to stop in your tracks _ let go
of your addiction to success and outward fulfillment _ to find out
what those orders are.''
</P>
<P>
   And what force put them there.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to what Burg calls today's ``spiritual
revolution,'' which he says is in direct proportion to baby boomers
getting older.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there really is, gulp, a heaven. And it isn't within a $50
million mansion, a new Mercedes-Benz or a movie studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is when people start to ask if there's more meaning to
life than just money. They slow down, they focus on different
things, they take a breather _ even at the height of their careers
_ because that's when the maturity comes.''
</P>
<P>
   That and the common sense.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why he quit after one of his most successful seasons,
Patsy Hendren _ England's top cricket player in the 1930s _
replied: ``I'm going while you still ask why. I'm not waiting till
you ask `why not?'''
</P>
<P>
   If only Wayne Newton were so wise.

CANDIDATES DEFT AT NEGOTIATING CYBERSPACE ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Yours,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah admonished Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas during the first of the Republican
presidential debates earlier this month, ``is not user friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   As political zingers go, it might have been a bit lame. But that
Hatch would use precious air time to criticize an opponent's Web
site as ``pretty tough to use'' is only one indication of how the
presidential candidates are confronting the Internet and technology
generally, both as substantive issues and as pervasive cultural
forces.
</P>
<P>
   They are raising money over the Internet. They are raising money
from people who have grown rich from the Internet. They are
debating how best to nurture the potential of the Internet while
shielding children from pornography and consumers from potential
misuse of data about them. And in the early stages of the first
Internet-era national election, they are eager to let voters know
they are as comfortable with a mouse as the next guy is.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pace of candidate education is nearly as rapid as the pace
of technological development,'' said Rep. Christopher Cox,
R-Calif., who is one of the few true techies in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore long ago dropped his paternity claim to
the Internet. But Gore, who can sometimes be spotted with a Palm
Pilot clipped to his belt, dropped into the CyberStop Cafe in
Washington last week and with reporters and photographers watching
sent an e-mail message to Bill Bradley, his rival for the
Democratic presidential nomination, questioning his opponent's
stand on Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has held electronic town-hall meetings. And the
Republican candidates have gone back and forth about technology
issues regularly during their debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``In not very many years, politics has moved from a lot of
smoke-filled rooms and ward bosses giving out turkeys to
constituents to dueling e-mails,'' said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, a
Democrat with a strong interest in technology issues. ``This is an
extraordinary transformation in politics. To reach the swing,
independent voters who are going to decide about the 2000
elections, you've got to talk about these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The most politically charged of the issues may be whether and
how to apply sales taxes to electronic commerce, and it is shaping
up as a test of the candidates' views on the Internet in the
economy and society.
</P>
<P>
   Most governors and many local government officials are worried
that as business migrates from Main Street and the mall to
Amazon.com and eBay, state governments will face a fiscal crisis,
since online retailers for the most part are not required to
collect sales taxes, the primary revenue source for states.
</P>
<P>
   But in Washington, there is support in both parties for making
the Internet a permanently tax-free shopping zone. A government
commission studying the matter seems headed toward a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is particularly tricky for Bush, who is trying to
establish his anti-tax credentials but shares the concerns of other
governors that revenue losses from a shift to tax-free Internet
shopping could leave states in a bind and hurt traditional
retailers. Bush favors extending a moratorium against Internet
taxes while the issue gets further study.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's unwillingness to come out definitively against Internet
sales taxes is being exploited by his rivals, who are suggesting
obliquely that Bush is soft on taxes and may be a bit of a Luddite
to boot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet should not be taxed,'' Sen. John McCain of
Arizona said. He extolled the Internet as ``the greatest thing
that's happened to the world,'' and compared its impact to a
combination of the printing press and the industrial revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governors are incredibly short-sighted when they want to
tax this baby in its cradle,'' McCain said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hatch said it was ``far overblown to think that the fact that
people buy over the Internet is going to reduce Main Street USA.''
</P>
<P>
   But the politics of technology can be complicated. Despite his
message to Washington to ``keep the government's mitts off'' the
industry, Hatch has been a supporter of the federal antitrust case
against Microsoft Corp. He has been raising campaign funds from
executives at some of Microsoft's rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, by contrast, says the Microsoft case is a waste of
time and money, because the pace of change in the software business
will render moot any court judgment.
</P>
<P>
   The scramble to raise money from technology companies almost
guarantees that candidates will continue to pay attention to the
issues on the industry's mind.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had raised $1.73 million from people affiliated with
technology and communications companies through Oct. 15, while Gore
had raised $1.54 million from them, Bradley had raised $770,000,
and McCain $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   But the candidates seem fascinated and intrigued by the
technology's potential to affect the world, not just dot-com
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Defending his support for bringing China into the World Trade
Organization, Bush cited the Web's potential to communicate
democratic values even in the face of opposition from a repressive
regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine if the Internet took hold in China,'' Bush said.
``Imagine how freedom would spread.''

PUTTING THE PUBLIC IN POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ANNE E. KORNBLUT   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kurt Ehrenberg wants to change politics. But first,
he has to change the way politics is conducted on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the rest of the world has successfully transferred
its business on line, politics on the Web remains something of a
joke, with anonymous ``voters'' casting meaningless ``ballots'' on
issues of the day. Despite a recent explosion of on-line polls,
none has won the respect of the political establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrenberg, a New Hampshire resident who last week held the
``first presidential on-line primary'' is part of a new breed: the
Internet poll scientist. He is among a cluster of analysts trying
to develop a system of reliable on-line surveys. And as a result,
he is on the front line of a growing battle over how democracy
should work.
</P>
<P>
   Never before has it been possible for the United States to
consider government by ``direct democracy,'' in which each person
votes on every issue. But now, the pervasiveness of the Internet _
and the developing potential to poll millions of people hourly in
their homes _ is rekindling one of the oldest debates in US
history: How directly should the masses decide public policy?
</P>
<P>
   The technology does not exist to hold a national daily
referendum on policy, such as whether to bomb Kosovo or ban
handguns. Nor is anyone suggesting the country should be run by
on-line polls, though Ross Perot's embrace of ``electronic town
meetings'' comes close.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts expect reliable on-line polling to have an
influence within a matter of months on local and state and even
federal levels, however, as congressmen respond to more-accurate
surveys and local officials toy with small-scale referendums on
issues ranging from the placement of stoplights to control of
suburban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe science can get to the point where the polls are
accurate. Then the question is, my Lord, do we want that?'' said
Douglas L. Bailey, publisher of Hotline, a political newsletter.
``The public can register its opinion immediately, and members of
Congress will be able to measure the public's view . . . and they
can vote that way. But is that their job?''
</P>
<P>
   Some, like former Clinton polling guru Dick Morris, argue
politicians should be held accountable to the public every day. It
is not a new question, but one that dates back to the ancient
Greeks, one that divided James Madison and Thomas Jefferson as they
debated how much power to give the public and the political elite.
It is a question that prompted British statesman Edmund Burke to
write in 1774: ``Your representative owes you, not his industry
only, but his judgment; and he betrays instead of serving you if he
sacrifices it to your opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke doubted the public's ability to make a reasoned decision
on every issue, and such concerns, shared by his American admirers,
led to the US system of representative government. Voters were
never supposed to decide matters of trade policy or commerce; their
congressmen and senators were. And officials were subject to the
public's whims only at election time.
</P>
<P>
   But that distance has eroded over the last century, beginning
with the emergence of reliable polling in the 1930s and culminating
with the Clinton administration, which has reportedly polled on
everything from bombing Iraq to whether President Clinton should
admit his affair with Monica Lewinsky. Now, with daily polls on the
horizon, some Internet advocates foresee a more responsive, and
responsible, government.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrenberg and his firm, Politics.com, are focused on the
presidential primary process. Currently, he said, each party's
nominee is essentially decided in early primary states such as Iowa
and New Hampshire. To counter the imbalance, Politics.com and the
firm Votation conducted their own ``primary,'' a poll intended as
an expression of how the rest of the country feels.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrenberg said he thinks electronic feedback will transform
politics, but he has a more immediate goal: overcoming scientific
hurdles, because ``there are a lot of polls on the Internet that
are fun for people to participate in but are meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   His poll was far from perfect. Although it was called a primary,
candidates from all parties ran against one another.
</P>
<P>
   The results were announced last Thursday: Of the more than 8,000
voters, 29 percent favored Texas Governor George W. Bush, 21
percent voted for Bill Bradley. Vice President Al Gore finished
fifth with 10 percent, behind Patrick J. Buchanan at 17 percent,
and Senator John McCain with 12 percent. The others had 5 percent
or less.
</P>
<P>
   Politics.com required a street address from each voter, which
was then checked against post office records to verify that it
exists and to guard against anyone voting more than once. It did
not eliminate other methodological problems, such as who voted and
why. ``It's not a perfect system,'' he said, but ``we're not saying
that it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Other firms are hard at work. Harris Interactive is spending $55
million on building a database of polling subjects who respond to
Internet questionnaires. InterSurvey is building a similar panel of
as many as 250,000 subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problems with on-line polling are demographics and
randomness. Though ubiquitous in many middle-class neighborhoods,
home computers and Web browsers are not nearly as universal as
telephones among the poor. And polls conducted on the Internet
today are weighted by disproportionate responses from activists,
the well-educated, and the opinionated, whereas traditional polling
relies on reaching a representative sample of the voting public by
telephone, using a random-digit dialing system that has proved
accurate.
</P>
<P>
   InterSurvey is attempting to coopt the traditional method by
randomly phoning subjects who then join its polling pool. After
agreeing to participate, each subject gets a Web TV unit and
Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think it is the wave of the future,'' said the firm's
opinion research director, Anna Greenberg, the daughter of former
Clinton pollster Stan Greenberg and an assistant professor of
public policy at Harvard's Kennedy School. ``I don't know who's
going to master it or who's going to corner the market, but I do
think everyone is very excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the long-term use of such polls are troubling to
some, given the history of Internet polling.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more provocative Web sites is Vote.com, which polls on
everything from Donald Trump's tax plan to criminal penalties for
children. Run by Morris, the site caused a stir after a Republican
presidential debate when it declared candidate Alan Keyes the
victor based on votes from users on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a great example. To suggest a guy like Alan Keyes
somehow emerges as a winner shows that kind of technique really
isn't useful,'' said Democratic consultant Tad Devine, who said
such a poll reflects a noisy on-line minority. ``It can distort
insight rather than give insight.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris is a champion of on-line polling, not only in predicting
elections but in influencing daily policy decisions. He invokes
Thomas Jefferson, who ``had to shelve his vision of a direct
democracy in which people made their own decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we are about to reclaim the power Jefferson would have
given us,'' Morris writes in his book, ``Vote.com.'' But, he said:
``Whether direct Internet democracy is good or bad is, however,
quite beside the point. It is inevitable . . . Restricting the
power of the people is no longer a viable option. The Internet made

XEROX IS CLAMPING DOWN ON COUNTERFEIT SUPPLIES 
 NEW RATINGS SITE TAKES SPELLING ERROR IN STRIDE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Step aside, Magnum. Make way for Xerox, private investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Seems the problem of counterfeit supplies _ cartridges, toners,
all those deliciously high-margin items that users of printers and
copiers must replace again and again _ has escalated badly of late.
A big factor is the ease with which counterfeiters can sell their
wares on the Internet. And Xerox does not cotton to counterfeiters.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been devoting ``significant time and resources''
to ferreting out people who make illegal copies of its copier
products, said William Steenburgh, vice president for Xerox's
consumable supplies business. Acting on tips from outsiders as well
as on information developed by its own security specialists, Xerox
has been running makeshift sting operations throughout the country,
buying products it suspects to be counterfeit and testing them in
its labs.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, they turn out to be the genuine article, distributed
through the hated but legal gray market. But often, they turn out
to be phonies, at which point Xerox pulls in local police officials
and even federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, one such operation in Milwaukee turned up
47,000 cardboard boxes, complete with Xerox's packaging codes and
logos, that could have held $8 million worth of products. The
packages were seized, as were the box maker's equipment.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Xerox and police officials presided over the
prearranged surrender of Robert Leonard, president of Alberta
International, a wholesale computer supplier in Pittsburgh whose
records showed he had sold $30,000 of phony Xerox cartridges. Xerox
now has a sting operation on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   A lot is at stake. According to William Duffy, president of the
Imaging Supplies Coalition, an industry group formed to battle
counterfeiting, the supplies business has quintupled in the last
decade, to $25 billion worldwide. He figures the combination of
counterfeiting, fraudulent telemarketing and trademark infringement
is costing Xerox and other document processing companies nearly $1
billion a year. ``Two years ago it would have been half this,''
Duffy said.

   NEW RATINGS SITE TAKES SPELLING ERROR IN STRIDE
</P>
<P>
   Judge not, lest ye be judged.
</P>
<P>
   A new shopping-comparison site called EWonders.com started up
last week. The site is meant to guide online shoppers by rating
e-tailing Web sites on various characteristics, like prices,
product selection and, of all things, spelling and grammar.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, the EWonders Web site misspelled ``grammar'' _
writing it ``grammer.'' EWonders fixed the mistake, after a
reporter pointed it out.
</P>
<P>
   Masood Faisal, an EWonders vice president, said the misspelling
occurred when the site transferred material from an affiliated
site, RatingWonders.com. ``It was spelled correctly on that site,''
he said, ``but somehow it was changed in the transmission.''
</P>
<P>
   Faisal took the incident in stride, noting that the the new site
had been developed in a mere 17 days. When EWonders scans the text
of other sites, he said, his company will use a spell checker.

ON THE WEB, PRICING ERRORS CAN BE COSTLY IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE

   When traditional retailers mistakenly label an item the wrong
price _ for instance, marking a $99 item $9.90 _ they might have to
apologize to a customer and give a quick lesson in decimals to a
clerk. On the Internet, they have to be prepared either to lose
face or to part with a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com is the latest Web site to confront this problem.
Early last week, it received a slew of visits from people who read
newspaper advertisements listing a Toshiba DVD player for $199.99.
When customers saw the actual retail price listed on the site,
$249.99, Amazon faced a no-win situation: Either honor the
advertised price and lose money, or explain the mistake and risk
losing the customers.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon ultimately decided to sell its stock of DVD players at
the advertised price, limiting customers to two per order. ``What
else can you say _it was an error,'' said Paul Capelli, an Amazon
spokesman. Capelli declined to say how many players the company
sold or how much money it lost in all. ``What's important is we're
taking a customer-centric approach to the solution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Internet retailers are coming to grips with the notion that
pricing errors can be far more costly online than in traditional
stores. Thanks to chat rooms, e-mail and shopping ``bots,'' or
automated robots, like MySimon and DealTime, which survey prices on
products offered at thousands of sites, such mistakes rarely remain
a secret for long. What is more, Web merchants have made a habit of
slashing prices to startling levels to attract customers, so those
same merchants cannot appeal to the reasonable expectations of
their customers when a pricing glitch happens.
</P>
<P>
   Buy.com ran afoul of those expectations earlier this year when
it listed a $588 Hitachi computer monitor on its site for $164.
Buy.com began taking the orders, but after realizing the error, the
company agreed to sell only what it had in stock at the time to the
first customers who ordered at the lower price, then refused to
honor the other orders placed. The company is now in the midst of a
class-action lawsuit based, in part, on its handling of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   A more innocuous version of this happened to Ashford.com, a
seller of luxury goods, which earlier this month posted five
watches for sale priced at $0.00 _ with free shipping, no less. The
company said consumers understood Ashford.com's decision not to
give away the timepieces, given their combined value of $11,332,
but the resulting bad press did little for the start-up's image.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mary Lou Kelley, Ashford.com's vice president for
marketing, the pricing mistakes were the result of a system used to
set up its merchandising pages before they were published on the
site. Under that system, which has since been scrapped, items were
given $0.00 prices until the correct number was entered.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kelley said the company posted a disclaimer on its site,
stating that it was not responsible for pricing errors, but she
added that the company would evaluate such situations case by case.
``We'll do whatever we can to make customers happy, short of giving
watches away,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is it more costly for Internet retailers to make such
mistakes than their off-line counterparts, but Web merchants are
far more prone to commit such errors, said Erik Brynjolfsson, a
professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan
School of Management. Brynjolfsson recently completed a study of
Internet pricing, and found that Web merchants changed their prices
``much more frequently'' than brick-and-mortar stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much easier to change prices on the Net, and the benefits
are much greater, because of shopping bots,'' Brynjolfsson said,
noting that even 1 cent price reductions can give companies greater
exposure on price comparison sites. ``But that presents a big
opportunity for mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   However _ and this news will not endear him to bargain hunters _
Brynjolfsson said that pricing errors would decrease with time,
``as pricing technologies and systems get more accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But in the short run,'' he said, ``these companies have to
discover the kinds of really stupid things they can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Anthony, chief executive of Brookstone, said the company
relied on a team of ``four to five people'' to verify prices on its
site, in the company catalog and in Brookstone's stores. ``It also
helps that we have one price on our items, no matter how you buy
them, so there's less of a chance of a mixup,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When a pricing error does occur on his site _ a situation that
has yet to happen _ Brookstone ``will appeal to the reasonable
expectations of our customers,'' Anthony said, adding that ``most
people are reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, he said, ``there are so many crazy pricing schemes
on the Internet that a lot of people wouldn't be sure what is a
reasonable price, so we'd have to look at each situation
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the concept of reasonable pricing on the Web has all but
disappeared with the advent of free computers, free Internet access
and merchants who have not been compelled by Wall Street to focus
on profits. That, in turn, has made it more difficult for consumer
advocates to deal with such cases.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission generally occupies itself with
unfair business practices like so-called bait-and-switch pricing
and cedes issues of pricing errors to state jurisdictions. State
contract laws, meanwhile, typically protect merchants who make a
genuine error in pricing.
</P>
<P>
   But other watchdog organizations may set higher standards. The
Better Business Bureau Online, for instance, is drafting a new set
of standards for Web merchants who want to post the organization's
seal of approval on their sites. The current version of the draft
requires merchants to ``comply with all commitments,
representations, and other promises made to a consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that statement would require a merchant to sell a DVD
player for $100 as a result of an advertising error, however, is an
open question. ``We're open to feedback on this one,'' said Russ
Bodoff, the Better Business Bureau Online's chief operating
officer. ``It's a difficult issue, because the Internet presents
real questions around this area of consumer expectations.''

Amazon.com applying lessons of '98 
By Frances Katz  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jeff Bezos is a happy guy.
</P>
<P>
   In person, the founder and chief executive of Amazon.com laughs
a lot, drinks a lot of coffee and talks excitedly about the bright
future of his Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon is one of the most successful online retailers, selling
everything from best-selling books to power tools and nearly
everything in between. In the race for holiday shoppers and their
dollars, Amazon is turning up at the top of nearly every list of
most-visited shopping sites.
</P>
<P>
   The great online shopping stampede of 1998 taught Amazon a few
lessons, and this year it is ready with not only a one-click
ordering system but gift-wrapping services and wish lists shoppers
can fill out and mail to prospective gift-givers.
</P>
<P>
   Bezos says one secret to his success is thinking of ways to make
the online shopping experience more fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers should not and do not spend time in the shower
thinking up new technologies for Amazon,'' he said during a visit
to Atlanta last week, laughing the kind of laugh you can only have
when the world is spinning just the way you want it to spin.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead into the 21st century, Bezos sees nothing but
fleets of UPS trucks speeding CDs, DVD players and power saws to
happy shoppers all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Bezos started out selling books, but not because of his love of
the printed word. ``We made a list of 20 products you could sell
online that you could not sell from mail-order companies,'' he says
of Amazon's humble beginnings. ``There weren't many mail-order book
companies, because if you tried to create a print catalog, it would
be the size of several Manhattan phone books.
</P>
<P>
   ``The realization I had was that one of the great things about
the Web is that you can build something online that you cannot do
in a physical store. We didn't know if it would work,'' he says.
``Frankly, I'm the most surprised person in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Bezos says that's one of the great things about the Web: It's
possible to use the Internet to sell as many books as you can keep
in warehouses. To make the process even easier for power shoppers,
the Web can add search functions and gift registries and recommend
other products in order to eliminate aimless browsing. You want a
book? Type in the title and order it. Simple. Easy. Profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Or it would be if Amazon didn't keep expanding to one product
category after another. ``We are a famously unprofitable company,''
Bezos says, flashing a ``What, me worry?'' smile.
</P>
<P>
   Bezos says Amazon is making money on the products it sells, but
that those profits are going to marketing and adding new product
categories like electronics and home improvement items.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to build a place where customers can come to buy
anything online,'' he says. But to do that he'll need the help of
third-party product providers, many of which are already on board
in the Web site's ZShops area.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do a good job in one area,'' he says, ``your customers
will ask you to do more. One of our challenges is to let people
know we sell all these different things.''
</P>
<P>
   One way to do that is through Amazon's series of TV ads
featuring a chorus harmonizing about the many products available on
Amazon.com and how many tons of toys Amazon has. ``Every ton weighs
2,000 pounds,'' they sing. ``That's a lot of toys.'' Some find the
campaign kitschy and cute; others say it's just annoying.
</P>
<P>
   Are the ads working? Bezos isn't sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody famous once quipped, `I know half my advertising is
working, I just don't know which half.''' He laughs that big,
booming laugh before getting serious again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes sense to heavy up during the holiday season. There
are lots of shoppers and lots of first-time shoppers. We have to
try and motivate people to shop online for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   But if you are going to drive even more people to an already
enormously popular site, you had better make sure that if you
promise a book in three to seven working days, it turns up in that
time.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows this better than Bezos, who admits he just scraped
by last Christmas and isn't about to let any kind of fulfillment
disaster ruin his holidays. He knows there's way too much at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to invest in the back end of your business,'' he says
simply. ``We think it's important to ship things to people. In real
estate they say it's location, location, location. In the online
world it's technology, technology, technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tarnish your online reputation with bad customer
service,'' he says. ``The Internet is unforgiving for companies who
don't fulfill customer expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's no laughing matter for Bezos _ or any of his
competitors.

AN EXPERT IN COMPUTER SECURITY FINDS HIS LIFE IS A WIDE-OPEN BOOK

 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the theme from ``Mission Impossible'' played in the
background, Kirk Bailey and a crowd of about 150 other computer
security experts waited for the results of a high-technology
treasure hunt. The prize? Bailey's most personal information.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, whose job includes protecting the privacy of medical
records, considers himself an average citizen, though somewhat more
careful about what he calls the ``fragile condition'' of privacy
today. In October, Bailey dared a group of security experts to
spend two months trying to dig up as much as they could about him.
Their only constraints were to stay within the confines of the law
and to avoid asking his family or friends for help.
</P>
<P>
   The results surprised even Bailey, who as manager of information
security at the Regence Group, an alliance of health insurance
plans, has forced him to think like an information thief to better
protect the privacy of medical records.
</P>
<P>
   Without his cooperation, permission or knowledge, the
researchers found a scannable sample of his signature; his speaking
schedule over the last two years, courtesy of an Internet search
engine; and details of his cat's diet by ``Dumpster diving.'' They
got copies of his home phone bills, though not cell phone records,
learned the value of his home and even discovered that he had been
born by Caesarean section on April 30, 1951, and got a C in English
at the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The nine researchers were all members of the Agora, a group of
more than 550 information managers from some 120 companies and at
least 60 government agencies, founded to improve the security of
personal information.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an enormous invasion on my comfort,'' said Bailey, who
founded the group in 1995 and named it after the marketplace where
ancient Greeks gathered to exchange information and gossip. ``Here
I can be sitting in my warm living room by the fireplace with my
wife, and I think my privacy is protected, but in fact that's just
a thin veneer and illusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Some information his colleagues gathered proved embarrassing,
some potentially dangerous to his financial security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now everyone knows I'm overdue on a couple of my bills,'' he
said, ``and they have information on my birth, with the necessary
three pieces of information: name, Social Security number and date
of birth.''
</P>
<P>
   The last four digits of a Social Security number, he noted, are
often used as a default personal identification number.
</P>
<P>
   The accumulated information cost less than $100 and required no
special training to find. Researchers collected it while holding
down full-time jobs, said Kristina Laidler, an information
technology supervisor with the Regence Group who had been
designated the event's ``raid controller.''
</P>
<P>
   She was surprised how easy it was to get Bailey's birth
certificate and college transcript. ``Those things just took no
effort. It was like punching through tissue paper,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators did occasionally resort to what they called
``social engineering,'' more commonly known as schmoozing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computers are great, but computers are not going to give you
all the information you need,'' said Brett Kappenman, another Agora
investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, no single bit of information was particularly
dangerous. But in aggregate _ and in the wrong hands _ it could be
ruinous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could cut and paste his signature from his marriage license
or divorce decree and put his signature on anything,'' Ms. Laidler
said. ``We could've closed his bank account that day. We could've
turned off his lights, we could've refinanced his house, and we
could've gone out and purchased a Mercedes Benz'' using easily
obtainable banking information and a few well-placed fake
references.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., who is sponsoring a federal bill to
protect the privacy of medical records, attended the presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``As someone in political life, I know I have very little
privacy,'' he later said in an interview. ``But the ordinary
citizen ought to be scared to death by what we saw today.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers can make themselves less vulnerable to such invasions
of their privacy by obtaining an annual credit report on
themselves, adding a ``fire wall'' to their home computer's
Internet connection or buying $50 software that can make them
invisible to other computers online, Ms. Laidler said.
</P>
<P>
   Online consumers should also read the privacy policies of Web
retailers to make sure they do not distribute personal information.
And home buyers should ask real estate agents not to send financial
information by e-mail, which is easily intercepted, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to understand their information doesn't just live
at the bank,'' Ms. Laidler said.
</P>
<P>
   In exposing his vulnerabilities so publicly, was Bailey just
giving crooks free pointers?
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad guys have already started to demonstrate they know how
to do this,'' he said.

   ``Anna and the King'' is a story of a love that cannot be.
Tragic pairings are often the kind that make the best movies.
Sadly, the pairing between Chow Yun-Fat as the king of Siam and
Jodie Foster as British schoolteacher Anna Leonowens is only a
tragic mess.
</P>
<P>
   The truly gripping story of ill-fated lovers in ``Anna and the
King'' is the screen-stealing subplot between the king's concubine
Tuptim and her peasant lover.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is a new take on the old tale of a Victorian widow and
Mongkut, the king of Siam. She has come, saddled with her tidy
little take on imperialism (``India is British _ that's what
colonization is all about''), to educate the king's brood of 58,
from his 23 wives.
</P>
<P>
   With every crinkle of his sexy crow's feet and his sleek black
hair (yes, he has hair), Chow is every bit a king. Although this is
just his fourth American film, Chow is a veteran of more than 70
Hong Kong action movies. His screen presence is magnificent, but
Foster, for her part, swishes along opposite him like a wet mop in
a dress.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment she minces off the boat, she refuses to follow
protocol in Siam in a way that seems more petulant than purposeful.
The king has reneged on his promise of a house of her own in which
to raise her son, Louis (Tom Felton).
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that there is a Burmese death squad roaming the
country pillaging villages and massacring, she wants a proper
British household. After she harps at him enough, he grants her
wish, but not before he has told her he finds her demeanor ``most
unbeautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   In time, Anna grows to appreciate the culture and even to admire
the king's devotion to progress. In time, the viewer grows to wish
she would fall off an elephant already.
</P>
<P>
   In Rodgers and Hammerstein's 1956 musical ``The King and I,''
another look at this famous pair, Deborah Kerr as Anna managed to
inject a sense of playfulness into a woman of purpose. Foster
spends most of the movie looking more harassed than in the throes
of love.
</P>
<P>
   While this yawner of a courtship is unfolding, treachery lurks
within the palace. The film treats us to a ferocious bad guy,
complete with deep facial furrows, which is how we recognize him as
the bad guy.
</P>
<P>
   He does not appreciate the king's devotion to progress, and the
conflict that ensues is filled with big, Hollywood action scenes in
which things blow up.
</P>
<P>
   Director and co-writer Andy Tennant _ of the charming Cinderella
story ``Ever After'' and the Matthew Perry vehicle ``Fools Rush
In'' _ does a fine job with this sweeping palette. The scenery
alone, rich with monsoon-swollen foliage and exotic landscapes
captured by cinematographer Caleb Deschanel, is worth the price of
admission.
</P>
<P>
   The king's wives and children are a bouquet of rich Asiatic
flowers in contrast to Anna's prim Victorian getups.
</P>
<P>
   In defense of Foster, hers was not the best female part in this
movie. The screenwriters gave Tuptim the hankie-grabbers, like ``If
love was a choice, who would ever choose such exquisite pain?''
</P>
<P>
   Tuptim is the daughter of a wealthy tea merchant who has given
her to the king as a gift. She first appears atop a golden
procession, weeping like a child for her impossible love. Her
doomed paramour, a man unhinged, reaches desperately for her and
cries out that he will never, never forget her as she is borne
behind the palace gates into the arms of a king.
</P>
<P>
   Tuptim (played by the Chinese actress Bai Ling) owns the screen.
Her face is a pool channeling the fury and desolation of her life.
We see her shackled and filthy, her head shorn, like a lightning
rod railing to the gods. We see her transformation from fear to
perfect peace, and it is as if the Buddha is resting serene behind
her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Anna and her king make a diplomatic decision for the good of
both their worlds. But we do not ache for them that they must part.
She just isn't fit for a king.
</P>

 INVESTMENT-OUTLOOK   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 &HT;     c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLONIE, N.Y. _ Investors will be able to make money investing
in the stock market next year, but will have to make their stock
picks more carefully, a noted investment authority said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stock prices will continue to rise through 2000, but stay
tuned,'' Hugh Johnson, the chief investment officer of First Albany
Corp., told the Albany-Colonie Regional Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The banking executive sees prices coming down on some of the
``high-flying'' technology stocks next year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of seeing stocks trade at price/earnings ratios of 28 or
29 to 1, as is currently the case with the Standard &AMP; Poors 500,
Johnson expects a ratio closer to 24 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate earnings will remain strong, he said, but stock market
prices are inflated in many cases, he said. The prices will adjust
downward in the first quarter, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Investment returns, Johnson said, will be ``more normal,''
closer to 8 percent to 10 percent a year, he said. Some investors
have seen returns of more than 20 percent in recent years, though
more than 60 percent of the stocks in the New York Stock Exchange
declined in value this year, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   So next year will still be a time to ``be aggressive'' in buying
stocks, he said, but the performance of individual stocks will
depend more on earnings and are less likely to climb just because
some other stocks are climbing.
</P>
<P>
   Economic growth is slow in 2000, probably to a rate of 3.2
percent, compared to 3.9 percent this year, Johnson said. And
growth will be slower in the first quarter, when businesses will be
adjusting to any after-effects of the Y2K computer conversion, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Johnson warned, the economy is starting to show
hints of inflation: higher short-term interest rates and energy
costs. Those elements could prove dangerous for consumers carrying
plenty of debt, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long-term interest rates should be fairly stable,'' Johnson
said. So companies deciding when in 2000 to borrow money can
probably wait until the latter part of the year and still get good
rates, he said.

CONCERN OVER YEAR 2000 REMAINS LOW IN SURVEYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the days winding down until the year 2000, each new survey
or poll seems to add to the evidence that Americans are confident
computer glitches will not have much impact on their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The National Federation of Independent Businesses, the leading
trade association for small companies, reported recently that many
members who had said last spring that they would take steps to
prepare for computer problems this fall had now decided not to
bother.
</P>
<P>
   And a survey for the National Association of Manufacturers found
that 93 percent of members expected the year 2000 to have almost no
impact on their companies and only 4 percent foresaw significant
disruptions of any part of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's news in this survey is what we're not seeing,'' said
Jerry Jasinowski, the manufacturing group's president, in
announcing the results last Friday. ``There's no last-minute panic
and little stockpiling of inventory.''
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers' sample was small _ just 100 of its 14,000
members _ but the economist who did the survey, Edward Yardeni of
Deutsche Bank, said the results were in line with answers to the
same questions by a much larger group of similar companies just two
weeks earlier. (The data from these surveys, and prior samplings,
is at www.peoplepolls.com). The levels of concern rise only when
certain sectors, like health care, are isolated, Yardeni said.
</P>
<P>
   The air of normalcy is being reinforced by surveys that are
actually thinly disguised advertising. Blockbuster Video recently
reported that more than 22 percent of those it polled planned to
celebrate the arrival of Year 2000 by renting a movie and staying
home. London International Group, maker of Durex condoms, reported
that among 16- to 21-year-olds around the world nearly half intend
_ or at least hope _ that the big night include activities
requiring its products.
</P>
<P>
   It all adds up to a challenging climate for many Year 2000
entrepreneurs, particularly those who anticipated that disruptions
and public concern would be in full swing by now.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the book world. ``The Millennium Bug'' by Michael
Hyatt, probably the best seller so far among Year 2000 books, is
hanging strong, relatively speaking, in the 820 spot on Amazon's
hardcover sales list. But ``Time Bomb 2000'' the one-time
hot-seller by Edward Yourdon, a well-known software expert, and his
daughter, Jennifer, was down to 12,322 overall in the rankings. And
``Crisis Investing for the Year 2000'' by L. Jay Kuo and Edward M.
Dua, was languishing at 86,808.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jan Nickerson, who claims to have created the only
Year 2000 board game, has just started a two-for-one sale ($34
including shipping at www.Y2KConnections.com).
</P>
<P>
   Those trying to sell their wares are increasingly competing with
others who make many of the same points more succinctly for free.
The Utne Reader recently began offering free copies of its Y2K
Citizen's Action Guide to any group that wants at least 50 (contact
mitra(AT)utne.com). ``Awakening: the Upside of Y2K,'' a collection
of essays on community and personal preparedness edited by Judy
Laddon, Larry Shook and Tom Atlee, costs $7 at Amazon.com; but Ms.
Laddon will give 50 or more copies free to anyone who pays shipping
costs (JGLaddon(AT)aol.com).
</P>
<P>
   And last week, Global Action Plan, a nonprofit environmental
group in Woodstock, N.Y., announced plans to distribute 125,000
preparedness brochures to community groups in 16 states, all
financed by the Nathan Cummings Foundation. (The brochure can be
downloaded free at www.GlobalActionPlan.org).

&HT;     MONEYBAGS BOUGHT AN ELECTION, BUT LOSE IN THE END 
</HEADLINE>
 SALTER-COLUMN   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For all the sweet moments of Tuesday's run-off
election for mayor, Tom Ammiano's most satisfying time may still
lie ahead: some day after Jan. 1, when ``soft money'' campaign
contributions must be reported to the state.
</P>
<P>
   It will be then that the Board of Supervisors president gets a
good look at just how much fear he struck in the hearts of San
Francisco's rich and powerful. Given what we've already seen, the
revelation could be the biggest ego boost a left-leaning
``outsider'' has ever received.
</P>
<P>
   Using a legal loophole that's become the size of San Francisco
Bay, supporters of incumbent Mayor Willie Brown may have coughed up
close to $2 million in 42 short days to make certain that Ammiano
was vanquished in Tuesday's election. That's a pretty impressive
arsenal against a man whom Brown supporters publicly dissed as
far-out, unrealistic and representative of only the radical fringe.
</P>
<P>
   Just the image of people like real estate magnate Doug
Shorenstein, Gap stores founder Don Fisher and investment banker
Warren Hellman, feverishly bent over their checkbooks, should be
enough to warm Ammiano's liberal heart for winters to come.
</P>
<P>
   One can almost picture all the members of the newly formed
Willie Brown Leadership PAC or San Franciscans for Sensible
Government holding big checks (with three or four zeroes penned in)
out in front of them like crucifixes meant to keep vampires at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations, Tom, you and your write-in victory on Nov. 2
scared the hell out of them. And you forced them to become the best
advertisement yet for the need to revamp the way campaigns are
financed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a series of ballot measures that have hacked away at
excessive campaign contributing _ the most recent in 1995 _ Brown's
supporters found a highly effective way to nullify the people's
edict: independent expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of giving money directly to a candidate's campaign _ and
thus being bound by the city's tight contributions limit _
sympathetic individuals or organizations can simply finance their
own television or radio advertising, mailers or billboards and sing
their candidate's praises to high heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, this loophole produced only $2,000 in soft money
donations. This time, according to estimates by Common Cause (a
reform group), the total will reach at least $2 million. Almost all
of it will have been collected for Brown.
</P>
<P>
   As Bruce Cain, a political science professor at the University
of California at Berkeley said, ``People are learning how to play
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The best part of all for those folks who wrote checks to
something like Sagitarians for Mayor Brown or 1965 Impala Owners
for Willie is, their identities and specific contributions won't be
revealed until after the first of the year. So far, though, we
already know that:
</P>
<P>
   _ The week before the run-off election, the landlord-backed
Building Owners and Managers Association dumped $22,600 into the
coffers of the pro-big business San Franciscans for Sensible
Government. The Sensibles, bankrolled by individuals like Fisher,
Hellman and Shorenstein, and groups like the Committee on Jobs,
already had spent a breathtaking $400,000 for a Brown run-off
victory.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Alice B. Toklas Lesbian and Gay Democratic Club forked
over almost $200,000 for its pro-Brown TV and mailer ad campaign;
$150,000 of that total came to Alice from an independent committee
that didn't even exist before Nov. 23: The Willie Brown Leadership
PAC, which was created by a Marin County lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Among the PAC's contributors are the Golden Gate Restaurant
Association (in for at least $40,000) and a bunch of real estate
developers.
</P>
<P>
   Yep. Two million bucks in 42 days for a run-off election. And
they're still stuck with Ammiano as president of the Board of
Supervisors. As political defeats go, this one is as sweet as a
whole crate of Ghirardelli's finest chocolate.

Our cup warmeth over 
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When making that grand list of annoying gadgets,
you have to include the cup warmer. Who thought of this ingenious
device? If you're not familiar with the cup warmer, it could best
be described as a disc that heats up and, in theory, keeps your cup
warm. Believe me, this is only in theory. This death disc does
nothing except heat the bottom of your cup to such an intense heat
that its only practical use is ritualistic burning of the flesh
(or, if you're on the creative side of things, you can use it to
fuse glass beads and make pretty sculptures). This gadget actually
has the ability to transcend ``annoying'' and enter the hallowed
realm of ``hyper-annoying.'' To attain this, all you have to do is
plug in the cup warmer next to a colleague's computer, let it heat
up and don't put a cup on it. The howls and screams will tell it
all.

A multitalented mini

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ We all want to make a ``Blair Witch Project.''
After all, the garage movie made $200 million _ and that would be a
nice chunk of change in anyone's pocket. Likewise, it would be nice
to have a digital camera that could record family events on video
and also take still photos. That's why you should pick up the
palm-sized Canon Elura MiniDV Camcorder ($1,800, www.canondv.com).
This bad boy offers high-resolution video, a still-photo mode and a
digital motor drive (which takes high-resolution pictures at 30
frames a second). The Elura boasts 380k pixels so the user can get
premium quality video and stills. The camera is also equipped with
a 48x digital zoom, a variety of digital effects and a color LCD
viewing screen. And for the budding auteur, Canon was nice enough
to bundle a trial version of Digital Origin's EditDV, digital
editing software.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ With the marching out of ``Toy Story 2,'' kids
everywhere are waiting with bated breath for the game. Wait no
longer! Activision's Toy Story 2 ($50 for Playstation and $60 for
Nintendo, www.activision.com) is on the shelf and is sure to be a
hot one for the holiday season. The game follows the movie in that
Woody, the cowboy doll, is stolen, and Buzz Lightyear and friends
take on the task to find him. In the game, you can earn rocket
boots, grappling hooks and other accessories to help in your quest.
If you're more into the sinister battle of new toys vs. old toys,
then Sega's Toy Commander ($50, www.sega.com) is for you. In this
game, you take on the role of Andrew, whose older toys have
rebelled against the newer ones. You must prove yourself a Toy
Commander and bring the toys under your control. Fantastic graphics

   Grolier Interactive's Virtual Serengeti ($30,
www.gi.grolier.com, for PC and Mac) is as loaded as an elephant gun
with enough live-action video to turn even the most sedentary young
joystick jockey into a big-game hunter. Players take on the persona
of a research assistant for a nature documentary, sent to Africa to
study animal behavior and collect video. Virtual explorers navigate
more than 50 360-degree panoramic environments and seven virtual
Serengeti locations, storing information in an interactive journal.
Along the way, players use the collected information and Grolier
Multimedia Encyclopedia online articles to answer questions about
animals they've spotted. Installation is a snap, and on-screen
video of Nature TV host George Page is available to help wee
adventurers who get stuck. The documentation says the game is for
ages 9 and up, but our test 7-year-old installed and played for
hours on his own. Virtual Serengeti is not your father's Sunday
afternoon nature film.

Before hitting the Web for toys, check the ratings

   ATLANTA _ We're thick into the holidays. By now, you've seen the
commercials. You've read the magazine and newspaper ads. Most of us
have been deluged with ads about companies wanting to sell you
things from their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   It's called e-commerce because Web shopping doesn't sound too
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   But which companies are worth your time and money?
</P>
<P>
   Gomez Advisors, an online industry consultant based in
Massachusetts, ranks Web shopping sites by how easy they are to
use, how secure customers feel, how much the products cost and what
resources are available from the Web site. The results are
available at Gomez's Web site, www.gomez.com.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez ranks the sites depending on the type of shopper as well.
For toy shoppers, Gomez considers those shopping for a gift, for an
educational toy, a trendy toy or a bargain toy.
</P>
<P>
   The top five toy-buying sites, as far as overall rankings were
concerned, were www.etoys.com, www
</P>
<P>
   .amazon.com, www.kbkids
</P>
<P>
   .com, www.smarterkids
</P>
<P>
   .com and www.zanybrainy
</P>
<P>
   .com.
</P>
<P>
   For those looking for the best price on toys, www
</P>
<P>
   .kbkids.com, www.etoys.com, www.servicemerchandise.com,
www.amazon.com and www
</P>
<P>
   .acetoys.com ranked highest.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez also ranks Web shopping sites for a variety of things,
including clothes, books, music, sporting goods, videos, cars,
computers, furniture, groceries and mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   OUT OF LOVE?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the boom is beginning to bust. Or maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Early results of a study by a sociology professor at London's
Brunel University found that American teens don't seem to be as
interested in the Web as they once did.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, presented at Britain's Westminster Media Forum
earlier this month, found that the number of former teen Web users
outnumbered current teen Web regulars.
</P>
<P>
   The professor, Steve Woolgar, attributed the early findings to
``boredom'' with the fad, according to an article on
www.techweb.com, an online technology magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But another London industry analyst, Fletcher Research, studied
the Internet habits of Britain's teens. Fletcher's most recent
British Internet User Monitor survey asked 50,000 Internet users.
The study found that those under the age of 18 made up 5 percent of
Britain's population, but 9 percent of Britain's online population.

   SITE HONORED
</P>
<P>
   An Atlanta Web site developer won a Webby for building the best
cultural Web site. The site, www.tsinoy.com, is geared toward
people with Chinese-Filipino heritage. Tsinoy.com was one of more
than 1,000 entries.
</P>
<P>
   Dux Raymond Sy works for Innovative-e.com. The Atlanta-based
company develops Web sites for companies that do business in the
domestic and Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
   Tsinoy.com offers news, information and links to Tsinoys, people
of Chinese and Filipino heritage.

Graphire program more refined than mere drawing with a mouse 
By Jack Warner  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I am no different from the average user in my
resistance to change. Whatever I'm accustomed to, regardless of how
antediluvian it may be, is almost always going to be better than
anything else, no matter how new and wonderful it really is.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, I believe I have become smitten with a new input
system.
</P>
<P>
   Wacom has long been in the business of making computer drawing
tablets for graphic artists. Being no artist, I never bothered to
try one until the company came out with its Graphire system.
</P>
<P>
   This consists of a stiff tablet about the size of an ordinary
mouse pad, a mouse and a pen, or pencil, as you wish. The pen and
the mouse are cordless; the cord is connected to the tablet.
</P>
<P>
   The one I'm using plugs into the USB port for Windows 98
systems. There is a serial port version for Windows 95 interfaces.
</P>
<P>
   I'm enjoying this outfit a great deal; it's an excellent system
for those who must have a mouse, but occasionally get involved in
graphics programs in which something more exact would be useful.
</P>
<P>
   I was somewhat put off initially by the lack of heft in the
mouse. However, it is a rollerless type and, once it is applied to
its tablet, this feeling goes away. The shape is only slightly
different from the standard Microsoft mouse and, like that standby,
it has two buttons divided by a wheel.
</P>
<P>
   It is, for me, just as comfortable to use.
</P>
<P>
   The pen takes some getting used to, of course. It is a simple
plastic tool, shaped like a pen, with an oblong button near the
tip. There is a blue protrusion on the back end which looks like an
eraser and indeed, in some applications, serves as an eraser.
</P>
<P>
   The software that comes with the Graphire system is quite good.
The mouse and pen are customizable, both for your entire system or
for individual applications. Even the mouse buttons and the wheel
can be reprogrammed, although it's hard to imagine anyone wanting
to do that.
</P>
<P>
   The harder you press with the pen, the stronger and darker the
line. The pressure needed to get the sort of line you ordinarily
want can be set up through the control software. Clicking on
whatever needs to be clicked is accomplished by tapping with the
tip of the pen.
</P>
<P>
   There is a penholder at the top of the pad to keep the
instrument and prevent damage to its tip. There is a clear plastic
overlay on top of the working portion of the pad. You can slip a
drawing or whatever under the overlay, and then trace it out into
the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Outlined on the main section of the pad is a rectangle that
represents the computer screen. You can set up the pen so that
where it works on the pad corresponds exactly to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if you open up a graphics program, take the pen
and make squiggles on the upper left corner of the tablet
rectangle, that's where you'll make them on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   The mouse can be made to work this way, too, but that gets very
confusing.
</P>
<P>
   Using the pen comfortably takes practice, but, if you'll recall,
so did using the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The pen ordinarily won't work in a word processor, but there's
an accompanying program that will allow you to use the pen to mark
up copy. There's also a nice paint program, although a drawing
program would seem more useful.
</P>
<P>
   The printed manual is very skimpy, but the online manual is
outstanding. For $99.95, Graphire is very hard to resist. More
information is available at www.wacom.com.

COMPUTER CONSULTANT TO BUY USWEB IN A STOCK SWAP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Whittman-Hart Inc., a computer consulting
company based in Chicago, said Monday that it has agreed to acquire
USWeb/CKS, a company based here specializing in Internet design and
marketing strategy, in a stock swap valued around $5.87 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies said they would create the largest Internet
professional-services concern in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But Wall Street reacted negatively to the deal, sending the
stock of both companies plummeting. Shares of Whittman-Hart closed
at $54.50, down $24.75, or 31 percent, in Nasdaq trading. Shares in
USWeb also fell, if less starkly, closing at $43.8125, down
$7.0625, or 13.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Rooney, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette,
reduced his rating on Whittman-Hart's stock to market perform from
buy, while Gary Dean of J.C. Bradford lowered his recommendation to
buy from strong buy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some analysts said the deal made strategic sense.
Although Whittman has built a large, profitable business managing
computer systems for midsize companies, primarily in the Midwest,
it has only lately added Internet-related services. USWeb was one
of the first companies to specialize in Web site creation, and with
the acquisition last year of CKS, added expertise in marketing and
strategy. Buying USWeb gives Whittman strong Internet services,
these analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Whittman, which earned $18.8 million, or 35 cents a
share, in 1998 on revenue of $307.6 million, USWeb had a loss of
$188.3 million on revenue of $228.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts point out that much of USWeb's growth has come through
a series of acquisitions and may not be sustainable. The company
has acquired about a dozen consulting firms since it was founded in
1995 by a group of former Novell executives.
</P>
<P>
   According to the terms of the deal, each share of USWeb/CKS will
be exchanged for 0.865 share of Whittman-Hart stock. After the
merger, USWeb/CKS stockholders will own roughly 57 percent of the
combined company and Whittman-Hart stockholders, roughly 43
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bernard, the chairman and chief executive of Whittman,
will be chief executive of the new company. Robert Shaw, USWeb's
chief executive, will be chairman.
</P>
<P>
   USWeb experienced a degree of incredulity when its original
chief executive and co-founder, Joseph P. Firmage, was forced to
resign in January after publishing accounts of his meeting with an
alien from outer space. Firmage, 29, remains a major shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   Another co-founder, Sheldon Laube, left in August to create
Center Beam Inc., a company offering personal computers, wireless
networks and software by subscription. But USWeb still has clients
such as Harley-Davidson and Apple Computer.

 USWeb Ready to Merge With Chicago Firm  
 By Carol Emert   
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   San Francisco's USWeb/CKS, a Web consulting company, will merge
with Chicago's Whittman-Hart, a business-to-business technology
specialist, in a stock swap that creates an $11.7 billion
full-service Internet firm.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Whittman-Hart plunged $24.75 to close at $54.50 on the
announcement, while shares of USWeb/CKS sank $7.06 to $43.81 amid
concerns that USWeb/CKS already faces the challenge of absorbing
two separate, earlier acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the integration is going to be a challenge,'' said
William Loomis, an analyst with Legg Mason Wood Walker. ``There are
still a lot of unanswered questions. But the concept of a large,
full-service company in this fast-growing market is a very good
one.''
</P>
<P>
   The new company, which has not yet been named, will be the
largest consulting firm in the United States to focus exclusively
on the Internet. The goal is to combine Whittman-Hart's
business-to-business expertise with USWeb/CKS' consumer focus to
handle a broad range of client needs.
</P>
<P>
   USWeb/CKS specializes in Web site development and management of
consumer e-commerce transactions. Its clients include
Williams-Sonoma Inc. and FAO Schwartz. The company merged with CKS,
a technology-oriented advertising agency, a year ago to bolster its
creative services. It moved from Santa Clara to San Francisco's
Multimedia Gulch this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Whittman-Hart is known for developing and managing back-end
operations, including inventory control and supply ordering, for
midsize companies, such as American General Finance and Diners
Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a highly complementary fit,'' said Robert Shaw, the
chief executive and chairman of USWeb/ CKS, who will be chairman of
the new company. ``We can focus our efforts on solving business
problems from the consumer through the supply chain and back
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The merged entity will have more than 8,000 employees and more
than 70 offices in 13 countries. It's headquarters will be in
Chicago, but it will maintain USWeb/CKS's 1,000-member staff in San
Francisco, as well as its Santa Clara and Cupertino offices.
Combined revenues in the third quarter totaled $297 million.
</P>
<P>
   USWeb/CKS shareholders will receive 0.865 shares of
Whittman-Hart for each USWeb/CKS share. That will leave USWeb/CKS
stockholders with 57 percent of the company and Whitman-Hart
investors with 43 percent. The deal is expected to become final in
the spring, pending shareholder and regulatory approval.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Bernard, Whittman-Hart's president and chief executive, will
be CEO of the combined business. Whittman-Hart Chief Financial
Officer Bert Young will be CFO, and USWeb/CKS Chief Operating
Officer Robert Clarkson will be COO.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-member board will be composed of four directors from
each company, plus an additional director who has not yet been
selected.
</P>
<P>
   Some securities analysts downgraded their ratings on USWeb/CKS
and Whittman-Hart yesterday, noting that the San Francisco company
is still absorbing CKS and a smaller business-to-business firm,
Mitchell Madison, which it acquired in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, they've got a huge merger with another company,'' said
Drake Johnson, an analyst with Davenport &AMP; Co. who lowered his
rating on USWeb/CKS to ``hold'' from ``accumulate.'' ``That just
complicates the whole process.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Johnson said he expects his concerns to be short term.
``I think the combined entity could be a pretty powerful player in
the Net space going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the expense of USWeb/CKS's earlier acquisitions,
Johnson projected a net loss for USWeb/CKS this year of $203.3
million onrevenues of $507.5 million even before yesterday's
announcement. Johnson did not expect USWeb/CKS to become profitable
until the fourth quarter of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Whittman-Hart is profitable. Hambrecht &AMP; Quist analyst Dirk
Godsey is projecting a 1999 net income of $35 million on revenues
of $470 million.
</P>
<P>
   Godsey, who maintains buy ratings on both stocks, called
acquisition-powered growth ``a perfectly good strategy'' that has
been just as successful among Internet professional services
companies as organic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Pending regulatory and shareholder approval, the merger is
expected to be complete in April 2000.

CALIF. FIRM TO INVEST $1 BILLION, MAINLY IN E-COMMERCE STARTUPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By RONALD ROSENBERG   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andersen Consulting, which has helped fund more than two-dozen
Internet companies, announced an ambitious program Monday to invest
$1 billion over the next five years, primarily in
business-to-business electronic-commerce startups.
</P>
<P>
   Called Andersen Consulting Ventures and based in Palo Alto,
Calif., the new unit will receive $500 million from Andersen
Consulting and $500 million from some yet-to-be-named investment
banks and venture capital firms, said Jackson L. Wilson, who will
head the venture firm. He previously was managing partner for
global markets at Andersen Consulting, one of the largest
information technology and management consulting firms.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson previously invested $40 million in startups, and the $1
billion in new funding is expected to catapult Andersen to third
place among venture capital firm, behind Accel Partners, also in
Palo Alto, and Kleiner Perkins Caulfield &AMP; Byers of Menlo Park.
</P>
<P>
   In his new role, Wilson will forge relationships with venture
capital firms, investment banks, and other e-commerce providers in
North America, Europe, and Asia, regions in which the creation of
e-commerce ventures and dot-com companies is accelerating. The
focus, he said, will be on launching on-line ventures that bring
buyers and sellers together to create marketplaces in such areas as
plastics, global chemicals, and computer products.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new venture money will also go to Andersen
Consulting employees who want to start e-commerce businesses,
rather than continue as consultants.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this bold investment initiative, we are sending a strong
message to our clients, alliance partners, and our employees that
Andersen Consulting intends to lead in the new eEconomy,'' said a
statement released by Joe W. Forehand, managing partner and chief
executive of Andersen Consulting.
</P>
<P>
   To differentiate itself from venture capital companies, Andersen
Consulting Ventures plans to offer a combination of cash and
consulting expertise and provide consultants to help startup
companies, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to bring something different to the party,'' said
Wilson, 52, who plans to open a Northeast office in either New York
or Boston next year.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, the venture unit plans to invest between $5 million
and $25 million in each startup for equity stakes of 2 percent to
51 percent. Wilson said he also envisions investing in incubator
businesses, which house and nurture startups, but he declined to be
more specific.
</P>
<P>
   He said one of the early companies Andersen Consulting invested
in was ShopLink.com of Westwood, Mass., which provides on-line
grocery shopping with weekly deliveries in more than 70
Massachusetts communities. It competes against Streamline.com, also
in Westwood; HomeRuns of Newton, a unit of supermarket chain
Hannaford Bros.; and PeaPod, based in Chicago, which is working
locally with Stop &AMP; Shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got pulled into the ShopLink deal at an early stage, and it
is very promising,'' said Wilson. So far, it is the company's only
New England venture and one of its last business-to-consumer deals,
he said.

WILL ONLINE VOTING OVERCOME SNAGS TO ACHIEVE ITS PROMISE?
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By ANDREW J. GLASS  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For an idea whose time has yet to come, Internet
voting is drawing lots of attention.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by Dell Computer Corp. revealed that nearly 80
percent of current World Wide Web users _ more than 100 million
Americans _ would like the chance to vote on line.
</P>
<P>
   If the ballot box does find its way into cyberspace, some
experts believe, it could help reverse slumping voter
participation, which is especially prevalent among computer-savvy
young people.
</P>
<P>
   But staging a pick 'n' click election ``is not like most other
applications on the Internet,'' California Secretary of State Bill
Jones warned at a briefing here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said a forthcoming California task force study on Internet
voting will call for a four-stage process.
</P>
<P>
   In stage one, he suggested, Internet voting would take place at
the voter's wired-up traditional polling place. As mouse clicks
replace punch cards, ballots could be tabulated more rapidly. But
the thorny problem of online identity _ being able to prove you are
who you say you are _ would not arise.
</P>
<P>
   Stage two would expand the process to any local polling place,
including schools and libraries with fast Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commuters who went to work before the polls open could vote
during their lunch break,'' said Jim Adler, a former rocket
scientist who serves as chief executive officer of VoteHere.net,
one of several startup companies in an expanding field.
</P>
<P>
   During the next step, people could vote from kiosks located in
conveniently located malls and other urban centers. But Adler and
Jones both emphasized that these voters would be required to obtain
their Internet ballots through much the same paper-based
authentication process that today governs mail-in absentee ballots.
</P>
<P>
   A final and somewhat distant goal is remote voting at any time
and from any place with Internet access, including TV sets in the
home equipped with digital two-way set-top boxes. Before that
happens, election officials and computer experts must devise
totally foolproof ways of dealing with possible fraud and potential
hackers who could mount crippling virus attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet holds out the promise of allowing us to build in
integration of voting with voter education and information about
candidates that we never had before,'' said Larry Sabato, a
political science professor at University of Virginia who has
successfully used VoteHere's software in mock elections for his
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I think Internet voting is coming? Yes, I do,'' said Thomas
Ferguson, the Connecticut-based chairman of the National
Association of State Election Directors. ``But first there have to
be answers to some of the unanswered questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Pending legislation would direct President Clinton to initiate a
broad federal study of Internet voting issues that could provide
some of them.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's chief sponsor, Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., D-Ill., seeks
ways of implementing voting via cyberspace without furthering the
``digital divide'' _ the access gap between rich and poor, whites
and minorities, urban and rural residents.
</P>
<P>
   In introducing the legislation, Jackson said voting on line,
``presents a fantastic opportunity to reverse a 40-year decline in
national voter turnout. American families increasingly find it
difficult to take time from their busy work schedules, child care
and community activities to vote. ... The Internet could make
voting easier, more convenient and extremely efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the trail-blazing California study, which is due
out later this month, recent signs of interest include:
</P>
<P>
   _ A pilot program run by the Defense Department and at least
five states that will allow a small number of military personnel
stationed overseas to vote on line in next November's presidential
contest.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Arizona, as many as 50,000 Democrats are gearing up to vote
on line from their homes and offices in the party's March
presidential primary. To do so, they must first register with party
officials and obtain a secure digital code that verifies their
identity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Next month, VoteHere.net will host a straw poll for some 3,500
registered Alaska Republicans who live in a Texas-sized remote
region that is accessible at that time of year only by snowmobile
and dog sled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to talk about all the benefits involved,'' said
Adler, who has set up January Alaska vote. ``But this has to be
totally redundant and totally safe. It's not like Internet polling
or even (corporate) proxy voting, both of which have been around
for some time. With Internet voting, you can't have any mistakes.''

Accessing of groups can ease info hunt 
By Bill Husted

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What image comes to mind when someone says Internet?
Nowadays, for most people, it's the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Web has become (other than e-mail) the most
popular way to use that giant pipeline for information called the
Internet, it's not always the best way to get information.
</P>
<P>
   Long before there was a Web, there were newsgroups. Unlike the
highly graphical Web, these are basically message areas. You post a
message, usually a question or a comment, and all the other members
of that newsgroup can see it and comment.
</P>
<P>
   Using the newsgroups is easy with the right software, and you'll
find out today how to get the news reader programs you need. For
highly specialized topics, newsgroups are still the place to find
the real expertise on the Web. Newsgroups are organized according
to topics and _ no matter what your interest _ you'll probably find
it there. Parents, however, should be warned. The newsgroups also
include some topic areas that would be offensively sexual or
obscene, even for the most liberal.
</P>
<P>
   While your Web browser offers the ability to read and create
newsgroup postings, a dedicated news reader works best. The best
place to find that reader is www.tucows.com. Whether you use a PC
running Windows or favor the Macintosh, or even an Amiga or a
machine running Linux, you'll find a reader here.
</P>
<P>
   Simply select the operating system using the pull-down menus and
then type in the search word ``newsgroups'' ... without the quote
marks. You'll be zapped to a page describing the news readers for
your particular operating system. There's a description of how each
works so you can select the one that suits your fancy. Keep in mind
that the listing usually will have both shareware readers (which
means that you are supposed to pay for it if you decide to keep it
and that some features may be disabled until you do pay) and
freeware readers (no payment is ever made).
</P>
<P>
   If you're new to newsgroups, you may have a difficult time
finding the ones you're most interested in. Things are still sort
of nerdlike out there. All newsgroup readers will _ the first time
you use them _ load in the names of the newsgroups available to
you. You can then use search terms to find the groups that you care
about.
</P>
<P>
   But you have to get an exact hit to find the right newsgroup
this way. For instance, if you want to find a newsgroup that sells
amateur radio equipment and you use the term ``ham'' ... as in ham
radio ... you won't get a hit if the newsgroup's proper name uses
the word ``amateur'' instead of ``ham.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a way around this. And we'll get back to the Web for
that. A search engine called Deja.com (www.deja.com/) does an
excellent job of searching the newsgroups. Just like the search
engines you use to find Web sites, you type in the search term and
Deja will ferret out the newsgroups where that topic is discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Using the search engine is an excellent way to find the sort of
newsgroups you'd enjoy. Just type in search words, make note of the
newsgroups where the term appears and try them out. You can click
on the links that Deja brings up to check them out, too.
</P>
<P>
   One last newsgroup tip: Be aware that if you do post a message,
your e-mail address appears. Some people choose to use one of the
free e-mail services such as Hot Mail or Yahoo to avoid getting
both junk mail to your main account and revealing your main e-mail
address to the casual newsgroup browser.

I WRITE COPY FOR A WEB START-UP

 By DEIRDRE SHAW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, I abandoned the sinking ship of newspaper
journalism and hopped aboard a pirate vessel, the Internet. Instead
of writing news for a venerable newspaper, I'm now providing
content for a Silicon Alley start-up founded by two 20-somethings.
</P>
<P>
   My fellow reporters and I often grumbled about the long hours,
low pay and humdrum assignments at the Philadelphia daily where we
toiled on the suburban beat. Yet, when I told them where I was
going and added that, yes, at the tender age of 27, I'd be
receiving stock options, I saw sellout in their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Sellout? Maybe. But in journalism, you have to work your way up
the ladder for years. Your bosses have worked their way up the
ladder. You put in time at newspapers in states like Iowa and
Louisiana, and then maybe you have a shot at a staff job on a
newspaper in New York or San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In the new economy, if you're smart and confident, you don't
have to wait in line. You can be whatever you want to be. There are
no ladders and no pigeonholes.
</P>
<P>
   My new bosses at InfoRocket, an online information-auction
company where users pay other users for answers to their questions,
seemed excited about my arrival. Experiment with the copy, they
told me. We trust you.
</P>
<P>
   So I admit it: I was probably rubbing it in when I told my
newspaper friends that InfoRocket's co-founder, Matt Cassin, 24,
was wearing shorts during my interview. And that irreverent
employees had scrawled site models and quotes like ``Revolt Against
Time'' in black ink on the office's white walls. (I later learned
this was because the walls were to be torn down.)
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't just the casual atmosphere that struck me; what
bowled me over was the sheer energy of the place. People were
coming and going, banging away furiously at the keyboards, shouting
across rooms. At one point, Teo Montoya, 25, the other co-founder,
stumbled into the room unshaven and disheveled. He had been up all
night writing code, but that didn't stop him from sitting down with
me for an hour to talk about everything from my favorite movies to
the ``new information paradigms.''
</P>
<P>
   I hate to say it, but the hectic pace made me wonder if this
Internet start-up didn't resemble a newsroom back in the heyday of
newspapers. I belonged here, I told myself.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't have a computer or a desk for the first three days, and
it took even longer to get a telephone. But on my first day the
company ordered pizza and my 13 colleagues and I sat around the
conference table. ``OK, team,'' said Matt. ``How is everything
going? Do we need to discuss anything?''
</P>
<P>
   We really didn't, but we did anyway. I was forced to reveal my
most embarrassing moment. (Losing my bathing suit while
water-skiing, if you must know.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, I'm hard at work planning the e-mail newsletter I'll
eventually be writing for our users. ``I have lots of ideas,'' I
say. ``We'll take 'em,'' my colleagues reply.

 &HT;    CLINTON SIGNS BILL EXTENDING INSURANCE FOR WORKING DISABLED
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a memorial to the nation's most disabled
president as a backdrop, President Clinton signed a bill Friday
designed to help the disabled return to work by preserving their
federal health coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we say, with a simple but clear voice, no one should
have to choose between taking a job and having health care,''
Clinton said, standing before a large statue of President Franklin
D. Roosevelt sitting in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation reorients our policy by saying health care
ought to be a tool to getting a job, earning a salary, paying taxes
and living up to one's God-given potential. You don't have to worry
about losing Medicare or Medicaid any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Roosevelt kept his paralysis from polio largely
hidden _ a blanket obscures the wheelchair in the FDR statue _
Clinton said encouraging the disabled to work will benefit all
Americans by boosting the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``No country, however rich, can afford the waste of its human
resources,'' Clinton said, quoting Roosevelt. ``That is ever more
true as we cross the threshold into the new millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   The law, which overwhelmingly passed both houses of Congress,
requires states over the next four years to provide severely
disabled workers a ``ticket'' that allows them to obtain
rehabilitation, employment and other support services, either from
a government agency or private provider.
</P>
<P>
   It also extends by four and a half years _ to a total of eight
and a half years _ Medicare coverage of disabled workers who return
to work.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted the bill also would benefit workers suffering from
early stages of debilitating diseases such as Parkinson's disease
and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's
disease, by creating a $250 million demonstration project allowing
them to buy into the federal-state Medicaid program.
</P>
<P>
   Such workers now face the agonizing choice of leaving their job,
which often does not provide insurance coverage for such illnesses,
in order to qualify for government assistance.
</P>
<P>
   House Ways and Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, said the
new law ``will help people with disabilities pass through the doors
of opportunity and return to self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government should be tearing down barriers to work, not
building them up,'' Archer said. ``We are our brothers' and
sisters' keepers, and I can think of nothing more important than
providing support to help individuals to reach their utmost
potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Labor Committee Chairman James Jeffords, R-Vt., who with
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., escorted Clinton to to podium,
also referred to the FDR Memorial setting, noting that ``what
President Roosevelt felt obliged to keep private can now be
celebrated in public.''

SKIJORING GETS LAZY DOGS INTO SHAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Besides Lucy Studds, Rufus Whittemore, Oban O'Conner, Lady Jane
Gammons, and very few others, modern dogs have essentially gone
stupid because they don't have enough to do. Nothing really to
occupy the mind or stimulate growth.
</P>
<P>
   They're also out of shape, for the most part, and we're not just
talking about fraternity dogs fed on pizza scraps and stale beer.
</P>
<P>
   No, these are modern dogs, most of whom are underemployed and
given to all kinds of undignified foolishness with slippers,
pillows, and tennis balls. Especially in winter, dogs need chores
to keep them fit.
</P>
<P>
   As it just so happens, there is a growing outdoor winter sport
to alleviate this canine crisis. The sport is skijoring, which is
practiced widely in Europe, especially the Nordic countries.
</P>
<P>
   The ingredients include: snow, one to four dogs, harness and
leash, and a rider on cross-country skis. Then, mush, you huskies!
</P>
<P>
   Actually, any sort of dog will do, said Richard Dale-Mesaros
who, with wife Lydia, is promoting skijoring as just one option in
what he calls ``dog-powered sports.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we're in the business of providing equipment and
information to people doing any kind of active dog-powered sport,
be it skijoring or being pulled on rollerblades, mountain bikes, or
(snow) scooters,'' Dale-Mesaros said.
</P>
<P>
   Dale-Mesaros agrees most average dogs can use the kind of
activity skijoring provides. It also teaches people how to train
their dogs. In one case, he said, Lydia e-mailed instructions to
two women on how to train their Labrador retrievers to pull them on
mountain bikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They train them by putting a bunch of biscuits down one end of
a dirt road, and then let them take off, flying down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Some obvious problems arise when skijorers expect to practice
their sport at cross-country ski areas. The fact is, dogs and
cross-country do not blend well, and many areas ban dogs from the
trails.
</P>
<P>
   But not all. Some 14 New England areas allow dogs and skijoring
_ which in Europe is also done behind reindeer and horses. In
March, Waterville Valley will host the first skijoring World Cup
event ever in this country, and Dale-Mesaros believes this will put
the sport on the map.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the states, dog-powered sports are growing because there's
very little cost. About $80 for the gear, including the skijoring
belt, tug lines, and harness. Skis and dogs sold separately.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can start on the road to skijoring, said Dale-Mesaros, by
walking and running with dogs in the woods and teaching the
commands at forks in the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your dog can be sitting around on the porch all summer, and
you shouldn't expect him to drag you 10 miles without having a
heart attack. It's good to do some walking and running with your
dogs first to get them in shape. `Gee' and `haw' are the left and
right commands, `on by' means keep on going, and `whoa' usually
falls on deaf ears,'' said Dale-Mesaros.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need Alaskan malmutes, though they are the standard
sled-pullers in the north country. But any sturdy dog that can pull
the weight of a human can be a skijorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing about Labs and German shepherds and
retrievers,'' he said, ``is that they're very easy to train. Some
of the old mushers would tie their lead dog to a post and bring the
head from side to side saying `gee' and `haw.' But it's a lot more
dog-friendly if you can just go out and walk with them, giving them
commands when they get to a fork in the trail. When they make the
correct choice, you give them loads of praise and positive
reinforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, canine and human athletes compete on a World Cup
circuit all winter. The March 3/4 event at Waterville will be the
largest ever on the continent, with the entire tour here competing
for World Cup points.
</P>
<P>
   The course is a 7K groomed trail through the White Mountain
National Forest. The event has already attracted TV coverage, and
Dale-Mesaros expects a mix of dog lovers, cross-country lovers, and
lots of curiosity seekers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept of dog-powered sports is not yet mainstream with
the American public,'' says Dale-Mesaros. ``Give it another six
months and it probably will be.''
</P>
<P>
   One important tip for beginners to remember: ``Don't run over
your dog. It will slow down the whole learning process.'' And give
the dogs time to learn the commands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really cool when they do respond to the commands,'' he
said, adding that flying through the woods on a mountain bike and
having his Alaskan malmutes respond at a fork in the road makes
dog-powered sport the experience it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so excited about this,'' he said. ``This is the sport we
have a passion for. We love our dogs and we love doing stuff
outdoors with them.''

   Picked-up pieces while worrying about global warming and Tebucky
Jones starting at cornerback . . .
</P>
<P>
   --As for Rae ``Mind-if-we-check-the-trunk, ma'am?'' Carruth,
what is there to say other than, ``Where's the Mystic River Bridge
when we really need it?''
</P>
<P>
   --When Sports Illustrated gathered the greats of the sports
world at Madison Square Garden for its all-century TV show, the mag
listed the top six NBA players and did not include Bill Russell.
Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Michael Jordan, Larry Bird,
Magic Johnson, and Oscar Robertson made the cut. Preposterous. Any
top-six list has to have the man who won 11 championships in 13
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   --I don't know about you, but I'm having trouble buying Cameron
Diaz as an NFL owner in ``Any Given Sunday.'' She looks nothing at
all like Marge Schott.
</P>
<P>
   --Why do the Red Sox worry so much about season ticket- holders
scalping or reselling tickets when the Sox sell tickets to ticket
agencies? According to Sox flak Kevin Shea, ``The reason we go
after unlicensed sellers is that we're trying to protect our fans
from getting gouged when they buy tickets for our games.'' Some of
us might contend that the agencies are the ones doing the gouging.
</P>
<P>
   --Anybody else wonder about team morale when Lawyer Milloy
refers to Drew Bledsoe as ``Big Money.''
</P>
<P>
   --Wonder if Jacksonville running back James Stewart watches
``It's a Wonderful Life,'' this time every year?
</P>
<P>
   --If Carl Everett can just be as good as Ellis Burks, that'll be
good enough to make the Red Sox lineup a lot better in 2000.
Everett's domestic situation raises a flag, however. It's news when
a millionaire athlete loses custody of his daughter because of
child abuse charges. Wil Cordero and Christian Peter were run out
of this town because of off-field activities, and Everett would do
well to explain the touchy situation and put it behind him.
</P>
<P>
   --Speaking of Cordero _ who looked 20 pounds heavier when the
Sox played Cleveland in October _ the Pirates rewarded him with a
three-year, $9 million contract. I think he said he's always wanted
to play in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   --Sean McDonough not getting renewed by CBS is a joke.
</P>
<P>
   --Ken Griffey Jr. gets high marks for squashing a deal to the
Mets. He said he hates New York and backed it up with his actions.
However, it's tough to buy the ``Junior just wants to be closer to
his family in Orlando'' spin put forth by Griffey and the Mariners.
Anybody making $100 million can afford to move his family to
Seattle. Why can't Griff and the Mariners just admit that he
doesn't like the franchise or the new ballpark?
</P>
<P>
   --Nice to see that President Clinton wants baseball to forgive
Pete Rose. Pete and Bill are a good pair: two guys who believe that
a lie becomes truth if you repeat it enough times.
</P>
<P>
   _Tebucky ``Give Him The Damn Ball'' Jones says, ``My style and
his (Ty Law's) are different.'' Echoing the thoughts of Patriot
Nation, Globe desk whiz Scott Thurston says, ``Yeah, we know. Law
can cover guys. Tebucky can't.''
</P>
<P>
   --Rick Pitino snapping at TV's Bob Halloran was mildy
reminiscent of the Bill Parcells era.
</P>
<P>
   --The Globe's Page 1, in-dept interview with the inimitable Bob
Kraft almost had me crying Monday. Kraft dropped these whoppers on
our intrepid Meg Vaillancourt: ``When we got such a vote of support
from hard-working (Foxborough) people who were willing to come out
on a rainy night . . . it felt like it was my family saying
`Welcome home.' '' . . . and, ``I hope somehow we can try to make
it up to the good people of Connecticut and to the political
leaders down there who unfortunately took the heat for it.''
</P>
<P>
   --Keep an eye on Houston Rocket Cuttino Mobley, a former URI
player and one of the few NBA rising stars who puts on a show worth
NBA prices.
</P>
<P>
   --The New Jersey Devils play at the New Garden on the first
night of the next century. The Devils are coached by the greatest
high school hockey player (Needham) in Massachusetts history,
Robbie Ftorek, and their assistant coach, Viacheslav Fetisov, was a
member of the 1980 Soviet Union Olympic team that lost to Mike
Eruzione and Co. in Lake Placid. They've also got a 19-year-old
rookie, Scott Gomez, who is the first player of Hispanic lineage
(his dad's from Mexico, his mom's Columbian, and he grew up in
Anchorage) in NHL history.
</P>
<P>
   --Tough year for both author and subject of ``The Girl Who Loved
Tom Gordon,'' by Stephen King. The horror writer looks as if he'll
be back before Flash.
</P>
<P>
   --What will we all do when we don't have Pete Carroll to kick

<P>
   Dick Ebersol is one of the most powerful men in television
sports.
</P>
<P>
   Smart and charming, the president of NBC Sports would have us
believe that the reappointment of Marv Albert as lead NBA
play-by-play announcer was an act of graciousness on the part of
Bob Costas, the guy who replaced Albert after his little legal
problem.
</P>
<P>
   You remember the sordid tale of biting and garter belts, the
claims of innocence everywhere except inside the Virginia
courthouse where Albert pleaded guilty. All of that is behind
Albert these days, and Ebersol, to his credit, always said Albert
had a home at NBC as long as he was on watch.
</P>
<P>
   So it was written; so it was done.
</P>
<P>
   The Albert rehabilitation started three years ago when the
Madison Square Garden cable network hired him to call Knicks games.
Turner Sports put him on its payroll shortly after that, and NBC
followed suit. Albert resumes his lead NBA position next season.
</P>
<P>
   Albert is one of the boys, and his return was predictable. But
the real reason Albert is back is not that Costas was gracious but
that Costas just wasn't that good as a basketball announcer.
</P>
<P>
   Costas concedes that he wasn't as good as Albert, but that
didn't stop him from taking the job given him on a platter by
Ebersol. At the time, Greg Gumbel was the number two play-by-play
guy at NBC. Gumbel quit soon after and became CBS's top
play-by-play guy for NFL games.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol is very smooth. Whether NBA receives high ratings with
Albert next fall remains to be seen. But as it is now, the NBA is
losing viewers, and Albert alone won't reverse the trend.
</P>
<P>
   Costas certainly couldn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   Costas is sure to excel on his new assignment on HBO, which
announced that a new show with him as host will premiere in 15
months. According to Costas, the show will be a sports version of
``Nightline.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross Greenburg, senior vice president of HBO Sports, said the
show will fit with HBO's other programming, such as ``Real Sports
with Bryant Gumbel'' and some award-winning documentaries. ``Let's
be realistic,'' Greenburg told reporters. ``We don't have $800
million laying around to acquire a live sports property. With the
exception of our premier boxing events, we are not a live-sports
network. We know who we are and we have carved our niche by being
reflective journalists. Costas is an extension of our philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Costas has been at NBC for 20 years and has wanted to do such a
show for at least the last five. He would like the show to delve
beyond the surface of stories such as the ongoing one about Rae
Carruth, the Carolina Panthers wide receiver charged in the murder
of his girlfriend. ``We would want to talk not just about the
specifics of the case but also question what sort of person is
welcomed to college sports programs and what, if any, safeguards
there should be to prevent such a tragedy,'' Costas said.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Costas took a swipe at NFL pregame shows. ``I
understand that those shows are there to set the table for the
day's games,'' Costas said. ``But to me, it's staggering that those
programs can be on air for hundreds of hours and never address the
largest issue _ franchise extortion and related stadium issues.
When I did the pregame show for NBC, I was champing at the bit to
do those kinds of stories.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   If not Carroll, who?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CBS football analyst Gus Johnson poses a good question: If the
Patriots get rid of coach Pete Carroll at the end of the season,
who will replace him?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to fire a head coach,'' said Johnson, who will
work with Brent Jones and Beasley Reece on Sunday's Patriots-Eagles
telecast. ``You can't tell me that Bill Cowher is any less of a
good coach because his (Steelers) team has struggled this year.
Pete Carroll is a young, enthusiastic coach who inherited a Super
Bowl team coached by a legend. He has made the playoffs the last
two years. Give the guy a break. If they fire Carroll, who will
replace him? There's not that many Super Bowl-winning coaches out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson believes that Carroll has been successful in his three
years and, while it has underachieved, his team remains one of the
more competitive in the NFL. ``My point is this: If you run Carroll
out of town, what coach is out there to replace him?'' said
Johnson. ``All the names that have been floated have strengths and
weaknesses. None have actually won a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to remember: The coach doesn't play. These
athletes are grown millionaires that have to execute on the field.
A coach can only do so much.''

MIT'S Y2K ADVISORY: BEWARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ If any organization in the world can be
counted on to be ready for the Y2K computer bug, it should be the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, home to more technologically
brilliant people per acre than maybe any place.
</P>
<P>
   And while some critics already contend that alarmists have
overhyped the risk that the date change-over to Jan. 1, 2000 will
cause computer chips to go berserk, MIT officials are taking
nothing for granted.
</P>
<P>
   MIT has not gone into panic mode, but given the technology
brainpower it represents, the institute's preparations could serve
as a warning to the rest of the world not to downplay the
possibility Y2K could bring serious computer mishaps, power
failures, and technological breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, beware.
</P>
<P>
   Besides ensuring an ample supply of flashlights, cots and
blankets, and hiring elevator technicians to be on site on New
Year's Eve, institute officials are urging that every one of MIT's
estimated 20,000 computers and servers that can be shut down be
turned off no later than Dec. 30, a full day before computer clocks
begin flipping over to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't need the machine on and you shut it down, you
have that much more time to deal with any issues that come up,''
said Gerald Isaacson, who is leading Y2K efforts for MIT.
</P>
<P>
   While it is far from an official dictate, MIT's recommendation
seems to reflect a growing consensus among computer experts that
people who can should avoid having their computers on and avoid
surfing the Web or logging on for electronic mail during the time
the world's clocks change over to 2000 _ what some specialists call
``crossing the millennium boundary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a smart piece of pragmatic advice that MIT is
giving its community,'' said Gary Beach, publisher of the
135,000-circulation CIO magazine in Framingham, a publication for
top computer systems managers.
</P>
<P>
   Because Jan. 1 will arrive in New Zealand as early as 7 a.m.
Eastern Standard Time on Dec. 31, and any problems there could
ripple across global computer networks, Beach said, ``I would
advise people here to turn off their computers no later than 7 a.m.
on the 31st and kick them back on the morning of Jan. 2.'' Ken
Donoghue of Stratus Computer Corp. in Maynard, which manages
systems that must run around the clock every day for critical uses
such as processing credit card and banking transactions , said he
also thinks MIT's advice is wise for those who can heed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's not going to affect your ability to do business, why
not? What's the downside?'' Donoghue said.
</P>
<P>
   In order not to lose MIT's trove of pioneering research, the
institute, which estimates it has more than 2,200 research labs and
facilities, is also urging professors and students to back up data
no later than Dec. 30 on a central storage system. Automated
transfers of data to the storage system regularly scheduled for the
31st of each month are being moved up 12 hours to begin at 6 a.m.
on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K issue relates to fears about the date changing over from
12-31-99 to 1-1-00. Some computers and microchips found in
everything from automobiles to appliances might read the new
two-digit date, ``00'', as being 1900 rather than 2000, and shut
down or malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   The theory behind shutting computers off well ahead of that date
change is that should a problem develop, it would be far easier to
fix when rebooting the computer a day or two after the new year
than it would be if the computer were on, connected to the Net, or
running a program at the moment the date changes.
</P>
<P>
   Some specialists also fear that computers will be exposed to
computer viruses sent by electronic mail timed to wreak havoc on
Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, university executive vice president John R. Curry
issued a lengthy set of warnings and recommendations that filled
two pages of the institute newspaper ``Tech Talk.''
</P>
<P>
   MIT originally planned to shut down all its elevators for
30-minute periods straddling both the Greenwich Mean Time change to
2000, occurring at 7 p.m. New Year's Eve in Boston, and again for
30 minutes beginning at 11:45 p.m. on the 31st.
</P>
<P>
   That plan was based on fears that power failures related to Y2K
could leave someone stuck between floors if they happened to be
riding an elevator right as midnight arrived in London or Boston.
Tests have shown the computer chips in elevator microprocessors
throughout the campus are fine, and MIT's own power plant, which
serves most of the campus, is expected to be fully Y2K-ready,
Isaacson said.
</P>
<P>
   Isaacson said officials have since concluded that ``the cure may
have been worse than the potential problem'' and will leave
elevators running all of New Year's Eve. But, he said, ``We have
elevator mechanics who are normally on call who will be on site''
to work on any problems that arise.
</P>
<P>
   Curry also warned researchers that ``it may be safest to curtail
(if possible) the more hazardous experiments during the transition
weekend, as safety systems and emergency response resource
capabilities may be strained.'' It also urged scheduling hazardous
waste pickups early.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Curry said, ``It's awfully hard to prepare for
everything that's unforeseen,'' and added that ``we have to be sure
there's not a psychological snowballing. Things go wrong in our
labs every weekend. Things go wrong on our desktops every day.
We've got to be sure we understand what's really inherently Y2K''
if any problems arise over the New Year's holiday.
</P>
<P>
   All of MIT's residence halls already have cots and blankets in
case of a power failure or civil disaster unrelated to Y2K. Just to
be safe, however, MIT officials, with help from a crew of students
hired to help on New Year's Eve, will be setting many of them up
ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
   One factor that helps the situation is that most of MIT's 9,900
students will be gone for vacation starting next week.
</P>
<P>
   However, many people on the MIT campus are less than anxious
about Y2K. Frank Dabek, a senior from Cincinnati who is editor of
the student newspaper ``The Tech,'' said, ``I certainly don't plan
to turn my computer off over the holiday, but for people who can,
it certainly wouldn't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People that I've interacted with are not worried'' about Y2K,
Dabek said. ``Most people are more worried about finding a good New
Year's Eve party.''
</P>
<P>
   And CIO publisher Beach said, ``Why would anybody want to be
sitting at their computer on New Year's Eve unless they absolutely
had to?''

`STUART LITTLE' COMES UP SHORT ON CHARM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
STUART LITTLE 
Directed by: Rob Minkoff 
Screenplay by: M. Night Shyamalan and Greg Booker, based on E.B.
White's novel 
Starring: Geena Davis, Hugh Laurie, Jonathan Lipnicki, Jeffrey
Jones, Connie Ray, Allyce Beasley, Brian Doyle-Murray, Estelle
Getty, Harold Gould, Patrick O'Brien, Julia Sweeney, Dabney
Coleman, with the voices of Michael J. Fox, Nathan Lane, Chazz
Palminteri, Steve Zahn, Jim Doughan, David Alan Greer, Bruno Kirby,
Jennifer Tilly and Stan Freberg 
Running time: 92 minutes 
Rated: PG (brief language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The impetus to see ``Stuart Little'' will come largely from
parents who fondly remember the E. B. White classic about the mouse
who refuses to think small. There are, after all, only so many
times kids can sit through ``Toy Story 2,'' and here's an
acceptable alternative. But whether they'll come away from this
adequate but hardly magical retelling of the story about the can-do
mouse and match their parents' enthusiasm is questionable. In its
visual style and production design, especially the Little family's
ancestral digs, tucked in between two Fifth Avenue high-rises, the
film is designed to evoke a certain nostalgia for the genteel
patrician Manhattan world to which The New Yorker (and White's
writing) were aimed.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers have taken a few liberties with the story, right
from the start, when Stuart is adopted, not born, into the Little
household, which would have been even more difficult to explain
than the film's fanciful adoption procedures. Geena Davis brings
warmth and aplomb to the role of Mrs. Little, and Hugh Laurie
embodies Mr. Little with the button-eyed good cheer of a
traditional up-market greeting card. Jonathan Lipnicki, as the boy
who must learn to accept Stuart as a brother, goes through his
paces engagingly enough. But any retelling of ``Stuart Little''
must rise or fall on its mouse. This one rises, but only so far,
even though it allows sufficient weight for the story's message
about the qualities that sustain families.
</P>
<P>
   This Stuart was hatched from a computer, and is the product of
visual effects that didn't exist as recently as five years ago.
He's three inches of cuteness, and the voice of Michael J. Fox does
a lot to win us over, but we're never altogether nudged into
believing that we're watching anything but a sophisticated toy. As
impressive as the technological Stuart may be, I was more impressed
with the performances that the filmmakers, aided by a band of cat
wranglers, got out of the 23 cats playing the eight feline roles in
the film. Most of the cats are of course hostile toward Stuart. In
their eyes, he's lunch, but with attitude. Not that their menacing
ways stop the spunky little guy, but Nathan Lane's surly Noo
Yawk-accented house cat, a white Persian Chinchilla named Snowbell,
almost steals the film anyway. The new ``Stuart Little'' is OK, but
it's never so charming that you forget you're watching a
manufactured object.

   MIDEAST-TRAVEL _ JERUSALEM _ A review of what's going on at the
millennium sites. At Armageddon, the place where the battle to end
all battles is supposed to occur, the Israelis have fixed up the
park that is there. At the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where
orthodox Christians believe Christ was crucified, the five
bickering denominations in charge are trying to agree on where to
place an exit door _ the first change in the church in years. In
Bethlehem, the Palestinians have rebuilt the plaza and torn down
the ugly old British jail next to the church. (Kaplow, Cox News

Christ, born 2000 years ago in a land the original Mexicans didn't

COACHES IN THE LINE OF FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of the 101 head coaches in the NFL since 1980 (not including
interims), only eight have been fired after winning seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The situations have been quite different and some of the
dismissals are filed under the ``You-can't-fire-me-I-quit''
heading, but the two most clear-cut firings were done by the
Patriots, when general Patrick Sullivan fired Ron Meyer after a 5-3
start to the 1984 season, and by the Raiders, who fired Art Shell
following a 9-7 season in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The most bizarre firing was of John Mackovic in Kansas City
following the 1986 season, in which he led the Chiefs to a 10-6
record and into the playoffs for the first time in 15 years. Yet he
was gone when a player revolt supposedly occurred, and the Chiefs
promoted special teams coach Frank Gansz.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Ryan was also gone after the Philadelphia Eagles went 10-6
in 1990, but the firing came after he had lost his third straight
playoff game, which owner Norman Braman could no longer bear.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots coach Pete Carroll could join this select group.
</P>
<P>
   Bum Phillips, who was relieved of his duties in 1980 by the
Houston Oilers after having posted an 11-5 record and a
third-straight playoff berth, received a multiyear contract
proposal from Oiler owner Bud Adams at the time, but it wasn't
enough for Phillips, who turned it down and was replaced afterward.
He wound up taking the head coaching job at New Orleans in 1981,
and a year later was also named the GM.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Houston, Jerry Glanville was replaced following the 1989
season when his 9-7 team was eliminated from the playoffs.
Glanville claims he didn't want to enter the '90 season in the
final year of his contract, got permission to speak to Atlanta, and
coached that team from 1990-93 before being fired following a 6-10
season. Others say Glanville was fired in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Colts coach Ted Marchibroda finished 9-7 and lost to Pittsburgh
in the AFC Championship Game in 1995, but only after he asked for a
two-year contract extension while the Colts sent a message with a
one-year offer, which Marchibroda rejected. The Colts turned to
Lindy Infante, and Marchibroda took the head job with the Baltimore
Ravens in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Leeman Bennett's Atlanta Falcons finished 5-4 in
strike-shortened 1982 and lost a playoff game to Minnesota. He was
replaced by Dan Henning.
</P>
<P>
   Marty Schottenheimer walked away, he insists, from Art Modell
and the Cleveland Browns following a 10-6 season in 1988 after the
Browns lost to the Oilers in the playoffs. Schottenheimer refused
to fire some of his coaching staff and took a chance he'd find a
new job. He didn't have to wait long, as the Kansas City Chiefs
came calling.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer is certainly the only coach fired with a winning record
during a season. He had finished 8-8 in 1983 and was going along
fine until he decided to fire defensive coordinator Rod Rust after
a 44-24 pummeling by the Miami Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were at the league meetings that week and we received a
call from `Moose' Hoffman, who was our public relations man at the
time, and he said, `Ron just fired Rod Rust,' '' recalled Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got on the phone with Ron immediately and I said, `What are
you doing?' This came out of the blue. He had never discussed it
with the management or the ownership. Coordinators have always made
good money and so we were on the hook for it. So we told Ron he
couldn't do it. He said, `If you don't like it, fire me.' And so we
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said Meyer had a ``credibility problem among the
players'' and he questioned, ``Is this guy capable of leading 45-50
people?'' He gave the job to Raymond Berry, whom he dismissed after
the 1989 season when Berry refused to hire a defensive coordinator.
Berry wanted to take on the duties of head coach, offensive
coordinator, and defensive coordinator. ``We felt at that point,
Raymond needed some help,'' said Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   Several coaches have seen their last days after 8-8 seasons,
including Dan Reeves in 1992 with Denver, Bruce Coslet with the
Jets in '93, and Bobby Ross with the Chargers in '96 after a slow
downward trek from a Super Bowl appearance in '94.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Erickson lost his job in Seattle last season after an 8-8
mark and a 31-33 record. Bart Starr was 8-8 in '83 when his Packer
tenure ended with a 53-77 record. Bud Grant's first retirement came
after an 8-8 season in '83; he returned to finish 7-9 in '85 before
calling it quits in Minnesota. His successor, Jerry Burns, who was
55-46 during his tenure (1986-91), was fired after an 8-8 season.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, there are many different factors each coach
ultimately faces on judgment day. Either he didn't make the
playoffs, or he kept losing in the playoffs, or the team had tuned
him out.
</P>
<P>
   Shell was 56-41 from 1989-94, but owner Al Davis grew impatient
with his coach, who had made a most unfortunate comment about Jeff
Hostetler, calling him ``just another white quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Some liken Ross's situation to Carroll's, but the difference is
Ross took the Chargers to the Super Bowl, while Carroll inherited a
team that already had been there.
</P>
<P>
   There's a whole category of legendary coaches who left after
winning seasons following disputes with their ownership. Don Shula
``retired'' after '95 with a 9-7 record, George Seifert was gone
from the 49ers after a 12-4 year, Parcells left New England after
an 11-5 season and a Super Bowl appearance, Jimmy Johnson walked
away from the Cowboys after winning a Super Bowl in 1993, and Mike
Holmgren left the Packers after an 11-5 season and two Super Bowl
rings.
</P>
<P>
   With rumors circulating about Carroll, Glanville offered this
advice: ``It doesn't matter what everybody else says. It matters
what one person says, and that is Bob Kraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan was asked assess the management team in Foxborough.
Asked if there were grounds for firing Carroll, he said,
``Absolutely not. The stability of a management team is so
important. The life of a player is four years, no matter how you
look at it. You're going to have some good stretches and some
not-so-good stretches. For Carroll to have made the playoffs his
first two years and be over .500 now, that's pretty successful. I
don't care what market you're in.''
</P>
<P>
   He also defends vice president of player personnel Bobby Grier's
``poor drafts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody brings up the good players he picked,'' said Sullivan.
``Nobody brings up that Robert Edwards was one of his picks and he
had an unfortunate accident. One of the biggest mistakes I made was
not hiring Bobby in the position he's in a long time ago. He should
have been my choice.'' Sullivan instead hired Joe Mendes.
</P>
<P>
   Acutely aware of the hostile environment when a team doesn't
perform up to expectations, Sullivan said, ``If I were to criticize
my own performance, I was too reactive to that type of thing. The
Patriots now have a strong enough following where they can take a
long-term view. They'll have to ask themselves who can they bring
in here that will do a better job than Pete Carroll? The answer to
that question is guys like Parcells, Holmgren, maybe Seifert, who
are already working.''

IPO PUTS ENTREPRENEURS ON STAGE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're back (again).
</P>
<P>
   John Donovan, charismatic and controversial technology lecturer
to the corporate elite, and his wealthy entrepreneurial protege,
Sundar Subramaniam, are knee-deep in a new Cambridge consulting
company with an initial public stock offering priced and primed for
its first day of trading Friday.
</P>
<P>
   C-Bridge Internet Solutions is led by a senior management team
chock full of former Oracle Corp. executives, including the
consulting firm's highly regarded new chief executive, Joseph
Bellini.
</P>
<P>
   But a handful of offshore trusts and entities benefitting
Subramaniam, his relatives, and Donovan's relatives control a
majority of the C-Bridge stock.
</P>
<P>
   Subramaniam was the company's chief executive until May, and
C-Bridge documents say a ``substantial majority'' of the company's
business engagements were generated by sales leads from seminars
featuring Donovan and a company that counts him as an employee.
</P>
<P>
   Underwriters priced C-Bridge stock at $16 per share, which
valued the entire company at $276 million. It clearly marks another
public-stock fortune built for the investment vehicles connected by
Donovan and Subramaniam.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan, a former MIT professor and prolific author, has
attracted ardent supporters and critics in his life as an
entrepreneur. But it is on the seminar circuit where a big-picture
technology vision created his biggest following.
</P>
<P>
   Subramaniam, who was recruited by Donovan straight out of
Brandeis University in the late 1980s, is just coming off another
investment home run. His personal stake in International
Integration Inc., widely known as ``I-Cube,'' was worth about $310
million when the company he helped develop was sold to Razorfish
Inc. last month.
</P>
<P>
   International Integration Inc. was working in an area similar to
C-Bridge's business, selling consulting services, help with
electronic business, and ``transformation services.'' Unlike at
other young businesses Subramaniam helped build, Donovan appeared
to have no role at International Integration.
</P>
<P>
   But two previous public ventures, both with Donovan close at
hand, were disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Open Environment Corp. of Cambridge, Mass., a software company,
went public at $15 per share in 1995 and was sold to Borland
International for $4 a share less than a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Their next effort, OneWave Inc., went public in 1996 at $16 per
share and plunged to below $3 in less than a year. A venture firm
later bought a majority interest in the company, now called Primix
Solutions Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Public shareholders got clobbered in both stocks, but Donovan
and Subramaniam cushioned their own declines by selling shares into
the public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the case at C-Bridge, an IPO that involves no inside
sellers. Three of the big offshore trusts that own stock have
signed lockups that prohibit the sale of shares for periods ranging
from one year to three years.
</P>
<P>
   C-Bridge works out of the same building in Cambridge where many
Donovan start-ups began. Like other companies that grew up there,
C-Bridge trades in part on Donovan's high-tech following and
corporate backers, particularly Hewlett Packard Co.
</P>
<P>
   C-Bridge also has corporate muscle from Oracle behind it.
Besides the group of management alums, C-Bridge counts Oracle
president Raymond J. Lane as a director.
</P>
<P>
   Smack in the middle of one of the Internet's hottest growth
industries, C-Bridge boasts a roster of impressive clients and
fast-growing though modest-size revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The company has done business with companies that include
include US West, General Motors, SteelCase, Caterpillar, Liz
Claiborne, and Cardinal Health Care, according to public documents.
</P>
<P>
   But the booming e-business consulting industry is also drawing
heavyweight competition. By C-Bridge's own description, it
sometimes faces off against the likes of Scient Corp. and Viant
Corp. when it comes to Internet services, Sapient Inc. and Anderson
Consulting on systems integration, and Bain and McKinsey for
management consulting services.
</P>
<P>
   C-Bridge may well get off to a hot start as a public stock. When
underwriters priced the offering at $16 per share, they jumped over
the original estimate range of $12 to $14 each.

&HT;     TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING TOP CONCERNS IN BAY AREA 
</HEADLINE>
 SF-HOUSING   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RYAN KIM  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The skyrocketing cost of home ownership made
housing the second most important concern for residents in the San
Francisco Bay Area, according to a survey conducted for the Bay
Area Council.
</P>
<P>
   As it has for years, transportation remained the top concern in
the region, listed by 38 percent of respondents, down from 40
percent last year. The poll, which has been released by the council
every year since 1980, also included new statistics on Internet and
computer use in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve percent of the respondents listed housing as the biggest
problem facing the Bay Area, the highest number this decade. Sunne
Wright McPeak, president and chief executive of the Bay Area
Council, which is backed by businesses in the region, said housing
has not kept pace with the tremendous job growth of recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Housing has emerged as the second Achilles' heel in the Bay
Area,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The poll looked at the housing situation and found many
residents were discouraged by the cost of homes. Eighty-six percent
of those surveyed said housing costs had gotten worse in the past
year and 81 percent agreed there is a shortage of affordable
housing in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The random survey of 607 residents of the Bay Area was conducted
by telephone by the Field Research Corp. Oct. 20 to Nov. 3. The
poll has a margin of error is 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Many respondents said they want to see more housing growth, just
not always in their own neighborhood. Forty-eight percent of those
polled said they did not want new housing in their own community.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a true `not-in-my-back-yard' sentiment that hasn't
changed since 1994,'' McPeak said.
</P>
<P>
   Frustration with the region's transportation network and highway
system was still far and away the leading concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is uniform throughout the region,'' McPeak said. ``It's
true in every one of the nine counties.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite growing frustration with transportation and housing,
residents remained upbeat about the future of the region.
Seventy-three percent of the respondents said it was possible for
the Bay Area to grow economically while at the same time improving
the quality of life here.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the poll looked at how pervasive the
Internet and computers have become in the region. The poll found 79
percent of residents regularly use a computer, with 64 percent of
them using them at home. San Francisco led the region in computer
use with 82 percent of its residents using a computer, either at
work or at home.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found that 66 percent regularly access the Internet,
well above the national average of 50 percent, McPeak said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We truly have a digital bay and it's not just Multimedia Gulch
or Silicon Valley or pockets of Internet use,'' she said. ``It's
pretty evenly spread out.''
</P>
<P>
   The use of the Internet and computers, however, was not uniform
across economic lines. For example, of people making less than
$40,000 a year, 65 percent of them used a computer regularly.
Conversely, 86 percent of those making between $40,000 and $79,000
used a computer.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also found that residents with less education were less
likely to use computers and go on the Internet. Forty percent of
respondents with a high school degree or less use the Internet,
while 78 percent of college graduates go on line.
</P>
<P>
   With a healthy economy and low unemployment, only 3 percent of
those surveyed rated it the top problem. Fifty-two percent of
people said their personal finances were better than last year. The
economy was the top concern for residents in 1992 and 1993, at the
height of the region's recession.

INVESTOR PICKED A POOR TIME TO TRY BONDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, December 19, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. In September I received an inheritance of $100,000. I am 79.
I went to our savings and loan, intending to put it in a CD. The
lady I talked with asked if I would prefer a tax-free municipal
bond fund. I ended up putting the entire amount in a Franklin
California Tax-Free Income fund account. The price was $7.56 per
share at the time, and I paid a $4,000 sales charge. I realize that
it was my own fault, but I was not familiar with mutual funds. The
price is now $6.80 per share. My question is, at my age should I
continue to leave the money there or take it out and take the loss?
I do take out the interest each month. Will this rise in my
lifetime? What do you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   M.T., Long Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, you certainly picked a poor time to get into the bond
market, and an equally poor place to do your investing. Based on an
unscientific survey over nearly a decade of reading letters from
often-troubled fund investors, Ive found that the chances of a
person buying a mutual fund that they don't understand is greatly
enhanced if they buy their funds through a bank. In your case, its
probably not that the investment is inappropriate for you, but that
the risks inherent in the fund should have been explained in
sufficient detail to insure that you understood them.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the fund you bought is an excellent one,
and although it has had a bad year, the odds are excellent that it
will recover. Basically, bond funds of all sorts lose principal
value when interest rates rise, or when the market sentiment is
that they are likely to rise. Inversely, when rates fall or when
people think rates are likely to fall, the value of shares in bond
funds rises. Usually, this effect becomes sharper the longer the
duration of the funds holdings. When there is a portfolio of
long-term bonds such as your fund holds, the effect of rate changes
will be greater than for funds holding a shorter-duration
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of the interest rate increases of 1999 -- and the
fears that more are in the short-term pipeline -- has been that
this fund has produced a year-to-date loss of 3.53 percent as this
is written. Bond funds usually have about two tough years in every
decade, and for the nineties the bad years have been 1994 and 1999.
But good bond funds tend to make up the lost ground in the other
years. Thus Franklin California Tax-Free Income fund boasts a
five-year record of average annual total returns of 6.25 percent,
and a 10-year record of 6.48 percent average annual returns. This
is good enough to win it the top five-star rating from Morningstar
Mutual Funds, which credits it with above-average performance and
low risk relative to its peer funds.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, remember why you bought the fund -- to get a steady
tax-free income stream each month. This, as youve seen, continues
despite the fluctuations in the principal value.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion is to stick with the fund, which, if the patterns
of the past prevail in the future, will recover the lost ground.
</P>
<P>
   One final caveat: if you decide to make any further investments,
make sure you fully understand what youre buying before you make
the move. This time you bought a good fund at a bad time. Under
other circumstances, you might not have been so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My husband is 55 and earns $63,000 a year. I am 53 earn
$53,000. Our home is paid for and worth approximately $95,000. We
have no children living at home and no outstanding debt. We have
$170,000 in mutual fund and common stock investments through our
local bank; two years ago when we made the initial investment, we
were told to expect our money to triple in 10 years if all went
well. My husband has $44,855 in a 401(k) account from a previous
employer, and has a new 401(k) account just begun with his new
employer, to which he contributes 15 percent of his salary and the
company matches on a sliding scale up to 6 percent. I have a 403(b)
account worth $6,100 to which I contribute 22 percent of my
earnings. We also have $4,000 in IRAs. Can we expect to triple our
money in 10 years as the financial counselor at our bank has
stated? If we continue to invest as noted, at approximately what
age can we expect to retire? The officer at the bank suggest we
diversify our holdings by adding a fund that invests in small
companies.
</P>
<P>
   J.M., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A. If you continue saving at the current rate and if you achieve
average portfolio returns of 10 percent, you would have $892,007 in
ten years when your husband turns 65. That calculation is based on
6 percent employer contributions to your husbands 401(k).
</P>
<P>
   That may sound like a pretty tidy pile, but if you invested the
whole accumulation in fixed-income securities to provide an income
stream, earning an average 6.5 percent yield, it would amount to
$57,980 a year. Worse, if inflation averages 3.5 percent over that
period, that money would have the buying power of about $41,000 in
today's money. Not an overwhelming prospect, no. The situation
might be made rosier with Social Security benefits, and the
accumulation would be larger if you increased retirement savings
proportionately with any raises you get. But theres no question
that you would not be in a great position.
</P>
<P>
   If you increased your savings level so that both of you fully
funded IRAs each year, the accumulation would be $958,681, using
the same assumptions. Better, but still far from perfect. You may
want to consider delaying retirement until you reach age 65, or
until 12 years from now. At that point, again using the same
assumptions, you would have $1,133,995 if you saved at current
levels, or $1,223,458 if you funded both IRAs each year.
</P>
<P>
   That highest figure might produce an income stream of $79,524,
equivalent to about $52,500 in today's money, making the same
inflation assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   Is your banks financial counselors projection realistic? Well,
to triple your money over the course of a decade requires average
annual returns of 11.61 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Thats not far off the historical average returns for the stock
market, but given the overperformance of the market in recent years
(which I believe will be balanced by a period of underperformance)
I am more comfortable with lower projections. I typically use a 10
percent estimate for projecting the long-term growth of a stock
portfolio. But in the bankers favor, without going into detail
about your portfolio holdings, I absolutely agree that you would
likely do well if you diversified by putting about 20 percent of
the current balance into a good small-cap stock fund.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is your opinion of Massachusetts Investors Trust, class
C? I've been in this fund for about 16 months. I've been in this
for about 16 months. I bought it at $19.24 per share, and in that
time it has gone up $1.20 per share. At the same time I bought
Massachusetts Investors Growth Stock fund, class C, which is up
from $13.74 per share to $18.79. I am concerned that Massachusetts
Investors Trust has not performed well at all during a record stock
market runup. I know its all full of blue chips, so whats up?
</P>
<P>
   R.I., Malden, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, although both funds concentrate on large-cap stocks,
these funds are fishing in pretty different waters. Massachusetts
Investors, like most value-oriented funds, has been underperforming
the market pretty consistently for the past few years, but it has a
very good long-term record. Massachusetts Growth Stock fund, on the
other hand, buys growth-oriented stocks, putting its portfolio in
the market sector which has been the major element pushing the
broad averages to their recent highs, most particularly high-tech
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Should you sell Massachusetts Investors Trust and concentrate in
Massachusetts Growth Company? I wouldnt do it. The stock markets
are notoriously fickle, and today's darling is likely to be
tomorrow's goat, and vice versa. Moreover, with its value-oriented
portfolio, Massachusetts Investors is certainly better positioned
to weather a sour market.
</P>
<P>
   So my suggestion is to do precisely what you are doing --
diversifying into the two ends of the large-cap spectrum,
calculating that although they will not move in tandem, in the long
run each will have its day.

PHILLY EARNS HIGH-FIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was just a regular-season game between a pair of Philadelphia
schools, Villanova and Temple.
</P>
<P>
   It was no big deal on the national stage. But Wednesday night's
game was signficiant in Philadelphia, because it was symbolic.
Villanova was back in the Big Five family, after agreeing last
spring to resume playing a round-robin schedule of games against
its fellow city schools, Pennsylvania, St. Joseph's, Temple, and
LaSalle.
</P>
<P>
   If you are age 50 or older and a college basketball fan, surely
you remember the tradition of the Big Five, which once made
Philadelphia as hot a college basketball spot as any place in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Five schools playing each other in front of sellout crowds in
the cozy, if not always friendly, confines of the Palestra, vying
for the unofficial city championship each year while also going
about their business in their respective leagues.
</P>
<P>
   It was that way for decades. But times changed. Priorities
became different and Villanova, according to the consensus, decided
it was no longer in its best interests to continue. So the Wildcats
began playing only selective games against the other four
Philadelphia schools, not a round robin, and Big Five basketball
withered on the vine.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to last spring. Villanova found itself with two
fewer Big East games (16, rather than 18) on its dance card. The
Wildcats agreed to resume the round robin.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball unity in Philadelphia?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. ``What happened happened,'' said St. Joe's coach Phil
Martelli earlier this week. ``It was a sign of the times. Now it's
different. And I'm happy it's back. The Big Five didn't belong to
any of us, it was bigger than all of us, and I hope the tradition
of the past can be rekindled. The basketball community in
Philadelphia is whole again, and I think that's a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we had here in the past was the essence of college
basketball. It was almost like a clash of brothers. Before the game
and after the game, you would love your brother, but during the 40
minutes of the game, you hated him. This city is full of basketball
fans. Each school has some dormant basketball fans who lost
interest over the years. Hopefully those fans would come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Having said all that, let's move the scene a few hundred miles
north. To Boston College. Harvard. Boston University. Northeastern.
</P>
<P>
   Why not a three-game round robin in Boston each year, a revival
of the old Commonwealth Classic?
</P>
<P>
   A BU-BC game would certainly have more flavor and more interest
than St. Francis at BC, which was played in the Conte Morgue on
Saturday night before 3,000 fans, 2,950 of whom did not appear to
be BC students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be in favor it it,'' said BU coach Dennis Wolff. ``I
think it would be great for basketball in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We would certainly go for it,'' said Harvard coach Frank
Sullivan, whose team played all three other schools last season but
doesn't have BC on the schedule this season. ``It would be the
right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The stumbling block, obviously, is BC, which would appear to
have the most to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic director Gene DeFilippo, who came to BC from Villanova
and is very familiar with the tradition of the Big Five, at least
said he is interested in exploring the possibility. ``But you have
to understand it's different than in Philadelphia,'' he said. ``In
Philly, you are dealing with 40 years of great tradition, with a
deep foundation and history.''
</P>
<P>
   So when will the Eagles be scheduling BU, Northeastern, and
Harvard? ``I'm not sure we want to do that at this time,'' said
DeFillippo, ``but it is something to consider in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The down side for BC is obvious. A loss to BU, Northeastern, or
Harvard (which did happen last season) would look bad for a Big
East team. However, the Eagles and their conference are strong
enough to overcome a few speed bumps.
</P>
<P>
   And we're not talking about taking a trip to Cameron Indoor
Stadium. We're talking about getting in a bus and going across
town.
</P>
<P>
   BC's nonconference schedule this season has included games
against Holy Cross, Vermont, and St. Francis. Are those opponents
more attractive than BU, Harvard, and Northeastern?
</P>
<P>
   If college basketball is ever going to establish itself in
Boston, an annual round robin between the city schools makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky blues
</P>
<P>
   Things are getting ugly at Kentucky, where the Wildcats have
dropped out of the Top 25 and are only a .500 team.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the first two questions asked of Kentucky coach Tubby
Smith on his radio show last week:
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are we starting a point guard who wasn't ranked in the top
500 prospects in the country in his senior year in high school?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are we playing this Joe B. Hall style of ball?''
</P>
<P>
   The most damning part of the first question, of course, was that
the point guard in question happens to be Smith's son, Saul.
</P>
<P>
   No question the Wildcats are struggling. Through their first
five games, the Wildcats were averaging 60.2 points, the lowest
scoring average for a Kentucky team in its first five games in 55
years. A loss to cross-state rival Louisville Saturday night would
put the 'Cats below .500 _ and turn things even uglier in Lexington
for Smith.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Full-court press
</P>
<P>
   If you look up the term ``hoop junkie'' in the dictionary, you
are likely to find a picture of Jim O'Connell, the Associated
Press's highly respected national college basketball writer. The
season is not yet a month old and O'Connell has already covered 27
games. But next week might test even O'Connell's skills. He is
covering not one but two tournaments in Puerto Rico _ on the same
days. ``No problem,'' said O'Connell. ``The games are spaced out
enough and it's only 20 minutes between the two arenas, so I can do
it with no problem. Just as long as there's a Steak and Shake
around, I'll be fine.'' . . . The first month of the season has
established a pecking order of Top 10 teams. Ahead of the pack, by
a comfortable margin, is Cincinnati, with Connecticut, Arizona,
Michigan State, and Duke in the next grouping . . . Ohio State
continues to struggle to meet the expectations of last year's
surprising Final Four appearance. The bottom line is that the
Buckeyes are not as good as most people thought; they will be hard
pressed in almost every Big Ten game they play . . . Early
candidate for upset of year: Indiana State's victory the other day
over Indiana in the Indiana Classic, traditionally an IU block
party each year. The loss was the Hoosiers' first in the 26-year
history of the event . . . Tennessee has gotten off to a quick
start, largely because of the solid play of sophomore Vincent
Yarborough, who is averaging nearly 16 points a game and making 46
percent of his 3-point shots . . . Another hot team is Creighton,
which was picked near the bottom of the Missouri Valley Conference
but is unbeaten with victories over Iowa and Nebraska . . .
Remember the hype when Jerry Tarkanian returned to Fresno State?
Now the Bulldogs are just another sub-.500 team, and no one seems
to care what Tark is or isn't doing . . . San Diego State has
established a strategy under first-year coach Steve Fisher: Win
with 3-point shots. But it hasn't quite worked out that way: In the
Atzecs' first three games, they threw up 44 three-point shots and
made just five. However, help may be on the way next year. San
Diego State has signed Chris Walton, reportedly the best of Bill's
offspring. Walton turned down a scholarship offer from UCLA, which
has to be a first among the Waltons . . . Rick Majerus is not a
happy camper at Utah, where he has been grousing about more than
the room service menu at the hotel where he lives. Injuries are
part of the problem, but Majerus is also sniping at the media,
which could mean there is an underlying cause to Majerus's
unhappinesss . . . At Nevada-Las Vegas, Bill Bayno has the Runnin'
Rebels off to a fast start, with five wins in their first six
games. But the real news is that Bayno, who used to have a high
profile off the court, has toned down his act and become more of a
homebody, preferring staying at home to the nightlife that
characterized his first four years in Vegas . . . Oklahoma coach
Kelvin Sampson noted the $6 billion contract CBS signed with the
NCAA for rights to the basketball tournament and asks a pointed
question: ``Why can't some of that go back to the
student-athletes?'' . . . Bad week for the Rush brothers. Earlier
in the week, Jaron Rush of UCLA was suspended for possible NCAA
violations, and then, at Missouri, his brother Kareem was declared
ineligible for a possible NCAA violation . . . Dayton has turned
some heads with its 8-0 start, the best for the Flyers in 34 years,
with five of the wins coming against 1999 NCAA tournament teams.

GILL BECOMES A HIT ON THE BLUE LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Size does matter _ in preventing goals.
</P>
<P>
   Especially when that size comes in the form of 6-foot-7,
240-pound Bruins defenseman Hal Gill.
</P>
<P>
   And knowing that it's important to get better as the years go
on, the burly skater has added even more physical play to his game
in the last year or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to get better as the years go on,'' said Gill, in his
third year in the National Hockey League. ``You try to add
dimensions to your game, by adding different things, by playing
harder, by playing more aggressively, but the bottom line is you
have to be at your best not to give away any goals.''
</P>
<P>
   It is what the Bruins do best in coach Pat Burns's system.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Man uses his size effectively. It doesn't matter whether
he's putting a fierce hit on an opponent, or battling in a corner,
Gill likes to put his licks on the other team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to be big in the corners and get in the way a lot,
with some of the guys in this league trying to make little moves in
trying to catch you off your feet,'' Gill said. ``You've got to
keep a good center and get in the way as much as you can by using
your stick side, taking away the angle, and forcing them in the
corner.''
</P>
<P>
   With his added physicality, Gill tries to finish guys harder on
the glass. ``That comes with confidence. Once you realize who you
can hit, some guys you have to ride them out instead of taking them
hard to the glass. Some guys you can go up and be aggressive on
them. You've got to learn when to do it and when not to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Gill provides the big hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big hits are there when you can get it, but you don't want
to sacrifice your body position,'' Gill said. ``You don't want to
take yourself out of the play to make the big hit. The most
important thing is to eliminate the player from the play, and
that's what you try to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The big hits, however, aren't what Gill's size is all about.
``It's more with his reach and his strength along the boards and to
make it tough for people to go around him and with people getting
to the net,'' said Ray Bourque, Gill's defensive partner. ``Hal's
plenty strong and he's plenty big and he takes up a lot of room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest compliment Hal has going for him is when some top
guys in the league come in, they don't like going against him, they
don't like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gill and Bourque have been paired for 2 1/2 years now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great; he knows what to do with the puck all the time,''
Gill said. ``They read on him a lot of times. There's so much
pressure on him, so I can make the play up or if I pass it over, he
always makes the right play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we work well together, we know who's going on the puck
and who's going to stay in front of the net. Whatever the situation
is. After 2 1/2 years together, you learn what to do and when to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes to Gill's contributions offensively, he
chuckles. ``I'm not asked about my offense that much; it's not
really my job,'' he said. ``I try to help out when I can, but, for
the most part, my job is to play defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to score goals and get assists, but on a team,
you have goal scorers and you have role players and I consider
myself a role player,'' said Gill, who has 4 points (three goals)
in 31 games, with a goal and an assist against the Rangers Nov. 18
in a 5-3 Bruins win.
</P>
<P>
   Gill had 10 points (three goals) last season in 80 games, and he
contributed 6 points (two goals) in his first season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to move the puck up and get it in their end,'' he said.
``If I get a chance to take a shot, I try to use that as much as I
can, but otherwise, I try to keep it in their zone and get it up to
the forwards and let them do the work.''

FOR A GOOD DEBATE, PUT THE CANDIDATES AROUND A SMALL TABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The problem with televised debates is not the politicians who
perform in them but the people who put them on.
</P>
<P>
   Formats are dictated by the ``sponsors,'' be they TV outfits,
newspapers, or do-good organizations like the League of Women
Voters. The way questions are asked, who picks the questions, who
asks the questions are all matters dictated by the planners, and
maybe even one or more of the candidates if they have the clout to
force their preference on the organizers by threatening to pull
out.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates have to endure the format that is agreed upon
beforehand. And most formats are flawed because the organizers have
different intentions than the candidates. The politician wants to
look and sound good, make his or her points, and try to leave the
opposition on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   But the sponsors want to get attention, credit, or a reputation
for clout for their organization. TV outfits want their
anchorperson or correspondent to be moderator or a panelist.
Newspapers have the same interest in promoting their particular
personality. So formats vary widely, and we've seen that in the
three different debates put on by the six GOP presidential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The best format of the three was the one from Iowa Monday night,
with NBC's Tom Brokaw and a local Iowa broadcaster roaming a lower
stage. As strolling moderators, they shared the questioning duties
from a platform lower than the raised dais that held the six
contenders. There was a complex rotation for questions, and
candidates got to question each other, always a potentially
entertaining or illuminating occasion.
</P>
<P>
   But any time you have six candidates, the format becomes
tedious. Even with 90 minutes, there wasn't enough substance
dragged out of Governor George W. Bush of Texas and Senator John
McCain of Arizona, the only Republicans with any shot at the
nomination. Since TV debates are the forums in which most voters
get to compare candidates, there should be more of them, with
television networks and local stations blackjacked into providing
more free time.
</P>
<P>
   The most exciting televised debate I ever covered was the 1983
face-off between Wilson Goode and Frank Rizzo for mayor in
Philadelphia. Goode, a black sharecropper's son with two degrees
and an icy command of the facts and figures of city spending, went
on to defeat Rizzo, a two-fisted former police chief nicknamed
``The Cisco Kid'' for his habit of wearing twin pearl-handled
pistols in his days as a knuckle-busting cop.
</P>
<P>
   What was exciting was this: The live broadcast was first
interrupted by a female protester denouncing the exclusion of the
local fringe candidate, representing Bolsheviks United to Defeat
the Running Dogs of Capitalism, or something like that. After she
was yanked off the set of the sponsoring TV station, one of her
comrades, a man, jumped up and continued shouting in the same vein.
This was too much for the burly take-charge cop. Lurching around to
the front of his podium, the 62-year-old Rizzo collared the
miscreant right in front of the camera. As they tussled, Rizzo's
head kept jerking back toward the podium. His microphone and
earpiece were wired to it, and he kept grimacing as his head was
jerked back. Through it all, Goode, a buttoned-down,
middle-management type, stood dumbfounded. When help arrived, the
protester was dragged off, and Rizzo returned to his place and
resumed his spiel with aplomb: ``As I was saying before we were so
rudely interrupted.'' Rizzo didn't win the election, but he won the
night.
</P>
<P>
   The best format I've covered for a presidential debate was in
New York City in 1984, when Gabe Pressman, the savvy king of New
York TV people, moderated a tight contest involving Walter Mondale,
Gary Hart, and Jesse Jackson the Sunday before the crucial New York
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Gabe sat on one side of a small square table, no bigger than a
card table, with Mondale, Hart, and Jackson, cheek by jowl, nothing
between them but microphones and glasses of water. Sitting that
close, there's nowhere to hide. The key, in addition to proximity,
is to have a strong-willed, well-prepared moderator who can enforce
disclipline and time limits.
</P>
<P>
   Panels of journalists are a lousy idea for debates. They get in
the way, with clumsy questions. No one's ever sure about how tough
to be, how aggressively to follow up. Pressman was the perfect
choice _ a tough questioner who knew when to retreat and let the
candidates roll.
</P>
<P>
   We've been generally well served by the TV debates in
Massachusetts campaigns. The frequent clashes between Senator John
Kerry and former governor Bill Weld in the campaign in which Kerry
held his seat were models for serious intellectual engagement by
two experienced, top-flight politician-lawyers. That was a
heavyweight bout that went on for nine or 10 debates, more than
enough for any reasonably attentive voter to take the measure of
the men and their intentions.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone planning a presidential debate hereabouts, I'd
suggest ditching the usual journalist panel, get the contestants
around the smallest possible table, and use just one moderator with
a reputation for being tough but fair. Then let 'er rip.

THE REAL MEANING OF ACHIEVEMENT TEST FAILURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Something has to give on high-stakes tests. Demanding that
students pass rigorous standardized tests with substandard
educations is unfair, if not illegal. We also know that the answer
does not lie in a wholesale abandonment of tests. Too many children
cannot spell, count, or call upon enough common knowledge to thrive
in a surging economy and a civil society. Life is one long test.
Our children need to know how to pass it.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, 2003 is the year that students must pass the
MCAS tests in order to graduate from high school. Other states have
similar deadlines. There is nothing wrong with that. Most people,
even highly motivated ones, work better with deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   But the only people facing the deadline, the only ones who would
be burned at the stake of high stakes, are the students. It would
be different if the clock were also ticking and the straw were also
smoking at the feet of state and city officials.
</P>
<P>
   So arrogant state officials want standardized tests? Fine. They
want to block failing students from graduating? Fine. But first let
us see them work to attain the standard of quality education for
everyone. Let us see them held accountable if they fail the test of
providing equitable resources.
</P>
<P>
   Accountability for equalizing resources is so easy to measure it
should be a condition of employment. I suggest three such
conditions. And if governors and state education officials cannot
meet them by 2003, they should all resign.
</P>
<P>
   The three conditions are:
</P>
<P>
   --Quality teachers. Studies show huge disparities in teacher
quality. Nationally, 25 percent of math and science teachers did
not major or minor in those subjects. In low-income schools, the
percentage of such teachers soars to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The latest study, released this month by the Center for the
Future of Teaching and Learning, found that California public
schools finishing in the bottom 25 percent of third-grade reading
tests had five times more underqualified teachers than schools that
finished in the top 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The study said that schools with higher percentages of
underqualified teachers were ``dysfunctional. These schools are
simply unable to increase student performance without dramatic
support to help them improve.''
</P>
<P>
   --Course offerings. This has been documented dramatically in
Massachusetts. Latino and African-American 10th-graders are between
2 1/2 and three times more likely to be enrolled in lower-level
math than white students. White students were between two and 2 1/2
times more likely than African-American and Latino 10th-graders to
be enrolled in grade-level science.
</P>
<P>
   While the paucity of higher-level courses disproportionately
hits Latinos and African-Americans, huge amounts of white and Asian
students are also being failed by the state. Nearly half of white
students _ 46 percent _ and 42 percent of Asian students are not in
grade-level science. Less than half of white and Asian students are
in higher level math.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Cohen, assistant secretary of elementary and secondary
education at the US Department of Education, which is concerned
that the MCAS may be discriminatory, said, ``It's not good testing
policy, not good school policy.''
</P>
<P>
   --Class size. We need some caution here. California, which is
undergoing a massive class-size reduction campaign but also has a
major shortage of quality teachers and poor distribution of them,
is finding that lower class sizes work only with quality teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that the quality is there, smaller classes seem to
result in better scores, particularly in reading. Minneapolis
reported this fall that smaller classes sizes led to a 45 percent
rise in passing rates in eighth-grade, basic-skills reading tests
and a 17 percent rise in passing rates for math. Minneapolis says
that 79.4 percent of students who were in small classes for seven
years passed the basic skills tests, compared with 53.5 percent of
students with only one to three years of small classes.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``The Black-White Test Score Gap,'' Harvard University
professor Ronald Ferguson wrote: ``It is probably correct that
having fewer pupils per class can improve learning outcomes and
reduce racial disparities. There is no consensus on how small
classes should be, but few experts who think that class size
matters would condone a pupil-to-teacher ratio much above 20.''
</P>
<P>
   There has not been a consensus or will to fix the schools, but
with a clock ticking and the straw smoking at their feet, state
officials might find a second wind. They want the kids in at the
bottom in Boston, Lawrence, Springfield, and Holyoke to measure up
to the cozy towns at the top, Harvard, Wellesley, Weston, and
Lexington? Fine. But first let them deliver quality from top to
bottom in teachers, courses, and smaller classes.
</P>
<P>
   If they do not do this by 2003, then the MCAS and other such
exams are a scandal. Tying children to the stake of high-stakes
tests without a fair chance to pass them is abandonment and abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and educators who are guilty of such abuse should be
given two choices: either see their careers burned at the stake or
take the MCAS themselves.
</P>

MALDEN MILLS OWNER STUNG BY NEGLIGENCE CLAIMS

 By BRUCE BUTTERFIELD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ In the years since a huge fire destroyed Malden
Mills, owner Aaron Feuerstein has faced hundreds of crises in his
drive to rebuild the famed New England textile company.
</P>
<P>
   But few have been as unexpected or potentially ugly as the one
he faces today: a charge in a claim filed last Friday by 13 of his
workers that the injuries they suffered in the 1995 fire were at
least partly caused by negligence at the mill.
</P>
<P>
   Mill officials, insisting they have long supported full
compensation for the workers, call the negligence charge baseless
and see it as little more than legal maneuvering. But it has
clearly stunned Feuerstein, who has made fairness to workers a
cornerstone of his efforts at the mill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just shocked out of my wits,'' Feuerstein said during an
interview this week. ``I feel dreadful. Our hearts have gone out to
these victims. How could they do this? They're like members of my
own family.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, at least some of the 13 _ four of whom have returned to
the mill to help Feuerstein rebuild _ appear equally conflicted.
``I really like Aaron,'' one of them agreed Thursday, asking not to
be identified. ``I respect what he has done. He's done a noble
thing. I feel very bad he's going through this.''
</P>
<P>
   Feuerstein, 74, has drawn national attention for his liberal
worker policies. He paid all 3,000 of his employees full salaries
for months after the fire, and refused to rebuild in labor-cheap
regions in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the injured workers were seen as partners with
Feuerstein in lawsuits both had filed against companies that
supplied the mill with products linked to the cause of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   All of that changed last Friday, when the workers reached a
separate settlement with those companies for a reported $18
million. Hours later _ and with time running out on any further
action _ the 13 workers filed a new workers' compensation claim
charging Malden Mills itself with ``reckless conduct,'' and with
knowingly allowing dangerous conditions to exist in the mill's
so-called flock division, which is no longer in operation.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the workers said they had to file the claim,
including the charge of negligence, with the state Department of
Industrial Accidents by midnight last Friday or face losing the
right to seek additional compensation altogether because a
four-year statute of limitations was expiring. The fire occurred on
Dec. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers expect a quick settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Mill officials, who said they did not learn of the workers'
claim until this week, were caught by surprise. ``I know Aaron is
totally pro these injured workers,'' said Jeff Bowman, one of the
mill's executives.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman said the mill has spent $3 million beyond what was
provided by normal state compensation to ensure that all medical
and related bills were paid, and he indicated the mill was prepared
to do more.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, the company will fight any special claim of
negligence, insisting that the claim had ``no basis in reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert C. Autieri, the lawyer for eight of the 13 workers, said
the claim was filed only after efforts to reach a settlement on
further payments had failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we have a very strong case,'' Autieri said.
</P>
<P>
   If workers win the claim _ which will be heard administratively
by the industrial accidents department _ they will be entitled to
double workers' compensation payments. They must not only show that
Malden Mills was negligent in its operation of the flocking
operation where the fire occurred, but also that the mill operated
with reckless disregard for the safety of its employees.
</P>
<P>
   No other state or federal agency has made a similar finding.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration _ the
principal agency charged with investigating labor conditions at the
time of the fire _ concluded that Malden Mills did not violate
safety and health standards. In a later report, the state fire
marshal's office was more critical of the mill, but did not blame
it for the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Both agencies found that the ``most probable'' cause of the fire
was the explosion of dust-like nylon fibers created in the making
of flock upholstry. The nylon fibers _ supplied by other companies
_ were not supposed to pose a flash-fire threat.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 workers were working on two textile lines in the mill's
former Monomac Building when the fibers ignited, gravely injuring
eight of them. Some still face years of rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   At the time the fire, the flock upholstery operation was the
most difficult, and clearly the most hazardous, of the mill. In the
year following the fire, Feuerstein spent nearly $50 million trying
to rebuild the operation as a clean and modern one. He eventually
abandoned the effort to concentrate on expanding the mill's
signature business, Polartec manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the nearly $500 million mill complex on the
Lawrence-Metheun line is recognized as one of the safest and most
technologically advanced textile manufacturing facilities in the
country. It was also recently honored by the US Energy Department
as the most energy efficient.
</P>
<P>
   But if the road back for the mill has been long and, at times
rocky, it has been even more difficult for the 13 workers,
according to their lawyer, Autieri.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is suggesting that Aaron Feuerstein didn't do all that
he did after the fire,'' Autieri said. The new claim, he insists,
deals only with the mill at the time of the fire, and the injuries
suffered by the workers. Seven of the 13 workers are permanently
disabled, he said, with some still undergoing skin grafts and other
procedures to reduce scarring.
</P>
<P>
   Mill officials insist they remain sympathetic and support the
injured workers receiving all the help and care they require. For
years after the fire, Feuerstein's daughter, Joyce, was charged
with personally working with the victims and their families.
Charging the mill with reckless disregard for the workers' health,
they add, is both untrue and unfair.
</P>
<P>
   To Feuerstein, it is more than unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something I like. I hate it,'' he said of the
negligence claim. ``The reason I hate it is that Malden Mills
stands for being sensitive to the human equation and having
compassion. And if we're guilty of willful or neglectful action _
or anything of that nature _ then everything I have tried to
represent for a lifetime is in vain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a horrible thing,'' he concluded.

KENNEDY RAISES $3.6M IN MOST AGGRESSIVE FUND-RAISING DRIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Determined not to be caught off-guard by an opponent
again, US Senator Edward M. Kennedy has amassed $3.6 million in a
fund-raising drive that tops any of his past off-year efforts.
</P>
<P>
   As he closes out the year and eyes the 2000 election, Kennedy's
political war chest is 50 percent larger than six years ago, when
he headed into the fight of his life against Republican Mitt
Romney, a self-made millionaire who was prepared to spend much of
his fortune to unseat him.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy has raised about $9 million since 1995, two-thirds of it
from out of state, despite the lack of serious opposition as he
seeks another six-year term.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raising is a key part of a strategy designed to clear a
smooth path to reelection without the trauma of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The 67-year old senator has also reached out as never before to
political activists, reinvigorating and expanding his field
organization. In 1998, he was the only major Democrat to play a
high-profile role in Scott Harshbarger's failed gubernatorial
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting with Globe editors Thursday, Kennedy said he wanted
to stockpile donations before the election year so he would not be
burdened with soliciting donations during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But he also acknowledged that he did not want to face the
upheaval of six years ago when Romney caught him flat-footed and
low on cash. He said he is now prepared to meet a late challenge
from a wealthy candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very easy to come on in and on television and make it a
highly contested campaign,'' Kennedy said. ``I would much rather
spend the time now raising the funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's collections have been boosted in part by his changing
position on the controversial issue of political action committee
funds. In 1997, Kennedy, after years of refusing PAC funds, began
taking them, and quickly raised over $900,000 from the special
interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years the PAC donations made up about 15 percent of
his total receipts. Kennedy justified his shift in position, saying
it makes it easier to raise money, and therefore he can devote more
time to his Senate and constituent duties. PACs can give up to
$10,000, while individuals are limited to $2,000 per election
cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most effective time I have had in the Senate is in the
years between raising money,'' Kennedy said. Citing his 38 years in
the Senate chamber, he said:``That's where I want to spend my
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those contributions to his committee, many from the
special interests that lobby Congress, went into Kennedy's own
pocket when his political committee repaid him the $1.5 million he
had loaned it in the final days of the 1994 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   What is driving Kennedy, say state Democratic sources, is the
fright he experienced in 1994, when Romney ran even in the polls
against him a month before the election.
</P>
<P>
   That near disaster _ Kennedy eventually pulled ahead and won
with a confortable margin _ left the senator with a new campaign
mantra: never again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's ever going to sneak up on him like that again,'' said
one leading Massachusetts Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The state Republican Party hopes Plymouth District Attorney
Michael Sullivan will mount a credible challenge to Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   But Sullivan, whose only electoral experience includes races for
state representative and district attorney, is virtually unknown to
voters outside of the South Shore.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan says he is ``definitely leaning'' toward running, but
admits he would be the clear underdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just in the early stages, trying to identify whether
there's an ability to raise enough money to put on a statewide
campaign,'' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said he would set a target of at least $3 million.

CONFERENCE REUNITES WOMEN SEEKING PEACE IN WAR-TORN REGIONS 
</HEADLINE>

   BOSTON _ Mary Montague helped stanch the wounds of her fellow
Catholics gunned down in the streets of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   Sumaya Naser walked in front of Israeli soldiers firing rubber
bullets at rock-throwing Palestinians to protect children caught in
the crossfire.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa Emilia Salamanca helped stage anti-violence protests in
Colombia, despite the near anarchy there that often leaves the
outspoken in unmarked graves.
</P>
<P>
   The three women came to Boston this week to confer with more
than 100 other women from similarly embattled countries spanning
five continents.
</P>
<P>
   Women struggling to stop the bloodshed in war-torn territories
such as Kashmir, Nagorno-Karabakh, and Cyprus came to compare
strategies on halting violence, rebuilding ravaged societies and to
organize a common front against the mainly male-led conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   They also came to voice their views to officials in the Clinton
administration, the European Union and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many women don't have political power,'' said Swanee Hunt,
director of the Women and Public Policy Program at Harvard's John
F. Kennedy School of Government, who organized this week's
conference called ``Women Waging Peace.'' ``What we're doing is
trying to figure out where the rich resource of women can have some
leverage.''
</P>
<P>
   While most women throughout the world lack the political pull to
change their governments' policies, many have acted when confronted
by tyranny.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers in Argentina marched against the country's military
junta to protest the disappearance of their sons during the
so-called ``dirty war'' in the late 1970s. Russian women earlier
this decade risked being killed by their own nation's bombs to find
their sons and pull them from the fighting in Chechnya. Serbian
women likewise helped end NATO's onslaught against Yugoslavia by
demanding their sons return from marauding in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the women at this week's conference has a story to tell
about rising up against authority.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Montague worked as a nurse for eight years, riding
ambulances and delivering dying youths to morgues during the peak
of Northern Ireland's bitter conflict. She spent many years
protesting British rule there. Now, she's a community worker in
Belfast and is considering a run for Northern Ireland's new
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter much what someone's religion or nationality
is, we all bleed and feel pain in the same way,'' she said.
``What's important is that we work together to stop the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Lerman and Marta Eugenia Segura were chatting about the
conflicts in their countries over dinner one night during the past
week.
</P>
<P>
   Lerman, an Israeli peace activist, and Eugenia Segura, a
consultant to development organizations in Colombia, decided they
would work together to stop any Israeli arms sales to any of the
various combatants in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our connection is a good example of how you build coalitions
across countries,'' Lerman said. ``I told her, `Whenever you hear
about the presence of Israelis, let me know. We will publicize this
and we can protest it.' Whenever they have any kind of information,
we will try to start a big campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   After the 109 women return to their corners of the globe this
weekend, Harvard plans to stay in touch. The Kennedy school has set
up a Web site where the women will be able to post ideas and
consult professors.
</P>
<P>
   Later on, there will be additional conferences and Swanee, a
former US ambassador to Austria, said she expects the women to
draft a platform and pressure governments around the world to
improve their human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, the women are trying to lay the foundation of
what could be a broad international women's movement, Swanee said.
They hope their efforts will reverse a deadly trend that has left
noncombatants, mainly women, children and the elderly, increasingly
the victims of the world's bloody conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   That may be possible, they say, if women gain more influence and
are elected to positions where they can effect change. Until then,
however, the women said they will organize and speak out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call to your attention the role of women, not just as
victims and survivors, bus as pioneers and leaders of peace
initiatives,'' a statement concluding the conference says. ``They
are seeds of hope.''

ICELANDERS CLING TO ELFIN FOLKLORE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   HAFNARFJORDUR, Iceland _ This can be a tough country for
blasting out a foundation or constructing a roadbed.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the boiling geysers, wind-blasted precipices or
frozen barrens. It's not the razor-sharp lava rock that daunts
builders; it's the hidden people lurking below.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all sorts of beings beneath our stones,'' said
Brynjolfur Snorrason, a folklorist often asked to advise
contractors on how best to avoid the lairs of Iceland's elves and
other seldom-seen creatures whose presence nonetheless still seems
to permeate this far northern island nation.
</P>
<P>
   Highway engineers in recent years have been forced to reroute
roads around supposed elf dwellings. Similarly, builders of the
country's first shopping mall took care to lay electrical cables
and other underground installations well away from suspected abodes
of gnomes and fairies. Couples planning a new house will sometimes
hire ``elf-spotters'' to ensure the lot is free of spirit folk.
</P>
<P>
   In Iceland, such precautions are seen as simple prudence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be a strange country,'' said Arni Bjornsson, head of
ethnological studies at the National Museum of Iceland. ``Even
hard-headed engineers, who say they don't hold with superstition,
will build a road around a certain hill or boulder rather than take
the risk of offending elves.''
</P>
<P>
   Icelanders love to boast of how their beloved island republic
marches in the front rank of modern times. Literacy, 100 percent.
Poverty, zero. High-technology, all pervasive.
</P>
<P>
   Iceland is the most geographically remote of Europe's nations _
a thinly-populated realm of fire and ice rising from the North
Atlantic, just below the Arctic Circle _ but it's plugged in,
powered up and prosperous.
</P>
<P>
   And also overrun with elves, gnomes, trolls, light-fairies,
lovelings and a unique species called ``huldufolk,'' or hidden
people. Iceland even has a glut of 13 unjolly Santas, the so-called
Yuletide Lads, who skulk about cities, towns and rural farmsteads
each Christmas _ traditionally bringing more mayhem than merriment,
although lately they've stopped stealing children.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's president, Olafur Ragnar Grimsson, theorizes that
the surfeit of spirit-beings stems from Icelanders' abiding sense
of loneliness and isolation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Icelanders are few in number, so in the old times we doubled
our population with tales of elves and fairies,'' he said in an
interview at the presidential residence, Bessastadir, located on a
remote moor where snow dervishes and sea spume whip over
bizarrely-shaped formations of lava rock.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, there are only 273,000 people occupying a land
roughly the size of Maine and Massachusetts. And Icelanders still
take spirit folk seriously: Public opinion polls and academic
studies show more than half of all inhabitants think it possible or
probable _ 10 percent call it ``certain'' _ they share their island
with otherly beings, ranging from grumpy glacier-dwelling trolls to
occasionally gregarious hidden people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost everywhere in Iceland you will find people who believe
in such things,'' said Audbjorg Halldorsdottir, an official with
the country's Oveseas Business Service. ``Or if they don't believe,
exactly, they don't disbelieve entirely. Folklore remains part of
everyday life.''
</P>
<P>
   That lore is the occasional bane of construction engineers and
real estate developers. Earlier this year, Iceland's highway agency
had to change the course of a new road leading out of Reykjavik
after citizens protested that the original route would disturb an
elf's lair under a big rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who believe in elves, and we try to show
respect for people's beliefs,'' said Viktor Ingolfsson, an official
of the department. ``If that means building around an elf stone, we
try to accommodate.''
</P>
<P>
   Such broadmindedness might be just self-protection. Tales abound
of broken limbs, busted equipment and other woes befalling builders
daring to go where elves and hidden people traditionally tread.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, huldufolk are harmless, even gentle
beings,'' said Magnus H. Skarphedinsson, a schoolteacher and
self-described elf expert. ``But if you brutalize them, bad things
will happen. Perhaps only that your project will have big cost
overruns. But also you could fall from a disease. Or die. It can be
very dangerous to bother elves.''
</P>
<P>
   There are skeptics, of course, the National Museum's Bjornsson
among them: ``Hidden folk have provided a wonderful excuse for
clumsy workers: `I didn't wreck that bulldozer, boss, an elf did
it!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bjornsson, one of Iceland's foremost experts in folklore, called
himself a disbeliever, adding quickly: ``But not entirely, not 100
percent. It is hard to be totally scientific in a country as
spectacularly strange as ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Iceland was first settled in the late 9th Century A.D. by
Vikings from Norway and smaller numbers of Gaels from the British
Islands. They found an eerie, treeless wasteland still in the first
throes of creation _ with vast billows of steam hissing from
geothermal vents, volcanos spouting fire and new islets heaving
into existence off the boulder-strewn shores.
</P>
<P>
   Iceland remains a land in extraordinary natural flux. And its
prosperity is very recent: Until this century, most Icelanders were
impoverished sheep farmers or fishermen huddled in damp turf homes.
The population was regularly _ and heavily _ culled by famine,
plague and earth cataclysms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country seems custom-designed for superstition,'' said
Bjornsson. ``Such an extreme landscape inspires visions of the
supernatural. The everyday reality surrounding Icelanders would be
called hallucinations or nightmares anywhere else _ hot-water
geysers, molten rock, terrible earthquakes and the cold sea raging
all around. No wonder we have odd tales!''
</P>
<P>
   The rarely-seen races populating Iceland are said to include
elves, gnomes, light-fairies _ sisters to Tinkerbell _ dwarves,
lovelings (slender wee creatures inhabiting hedgerows) and mountain
spirits. Most of these have counterparts in the folklore of other
lands. But Iceland's huldufolk, or hidden people, are a unique
breed: Human-sized, highly-sociable beings dressed in colorful
costume, seeming to inhabit a sort of parallel universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``But sometimes they will invite humans to their cliff homes for
a chat and pancakes,'' said Skarphedinsson.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, perhaps, there's been an attempt by some
entrepreneuring Icelanders to cash in on the elves. Tourist
agencies flog ``hidden world'' maps purporting to show locations of
elf homes. Guided tours of elfdom are also on offer. All this is
less troubling to folklore purists than attempts to revise
Iceland's spirit people to make them seem more correct and
wholesome.
</P>
<P>
   A prime example is what's become of the Yuletide Lads.
Originally, these 13 creatures were nasty sons of the ogress Gryla,
sent forth on dark winter nights to steal children for her stewpot.
Then, earlier in this century, they were downgraded to less scary
mischief-makers, leaving rotten potatoes in the shoes of bad
children at Christmastime, but ignoring the good.
</P>
<P>
   These days they are portrayed as rascally but cute gift-bringers
fitted out in wool coats and red caps, and soon to be celebrated on
Icelandic postage stamps. No more sneaking away with babies for mom
to devour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reykjavik retailers didn't want child-stealers associated with
the selling season,'' said Sigrun Halgrimmsdottir, herself a
shopkeeper. ``So we're stuck with 13 American-style Santas, except
they are a little sly.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, truth is, no one takes these lads too seriously,'' she
said. ``Icelanders are too sophisticated for fairytales. We don't
need make-believe Santas when we have real-life elves and huldufolk
everywhere in our land.''

BUG &AMP; SUN CAN'T REPEL SUN-BUG SUIT

<P>
   Mitchell Swartz has three more university degrees than most
people. He has a master's and doctorate from MIT in electrical
engineering and an MD from Harvard Medical School. But that doesn't
mean he's smart.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, according to a lawsuit he has filed in federal court
here, Swartz made a very silly mistake. He and three business
partners turned over their research for a so-called ``dual
protection,'' combination sunblock and bug repellent to the
pharmaceutical company Plough Inc., because one of their mothers
was a close friend of founder Abraham Plough. Swartz's colleague
Robert Berlin has testified that he discussed the product, called
Sun-Bug, with Plough executives on numerous occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward to 1997, when, Berlin recounts, ``we were
astonished to find that the exact same product was on the shelf at
our local pharmacy.'' In fact, without informing anyone on Swartz's
team, Schering-Plough had launched a dual-protection sunscreen cum
bug repellent called . . . Bug &AMP; Sun. Great minds think alike!
</P>
<P>
   Swartz, who is acting as his own lawyer, filed a broad, 12-count
complaint against Schering-Plough this spring. It is quite
amateurish, alleging RICO (Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations) violations and civil rights claims against the New
Jersey-based health care giant. For ``breech of contract'' (sic),
Swartz asks for $13 million in damages; for gross negligence and
willful misconduct, $367 million.
</P>
<P>
   Laughable? Well, Schering-Plough isn't laughing. When it moved
to dismiss the case this summer, Judge William Young upheld
Swartz's breach of contract claim. Plough promptly switched law
firms, dropping Fitzhugh &AMP; Associates and hiring Bingham Dana LLP,
which had the consequent effect of dumping Judge Young. As a former
Bingham partner, he recused himself, and the case has been assigned
to Judge Nancy Gertner. (Bingham Dana also represents the Globe.)
In one filing, Swartz accuses Plough of ``judge-shopping,'' and
notes that he has so far had to square off against five different
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Bingham Dana's chief litigation partner, John Curtin, wishes he
had an effective Swartz repellent to rid himself of this litigious
gnat. ``Mr. Swartz is very bright, and he can spin a lot of tales,
and that's what this suit is about,'' Curtin says. ``We have all
this history in our files, and we haven't found any record'' of
Swartz's Sun-Bug research.

   Jeremy Stone, president of the Federation of American
Scientists, will be leaving his post June 30. ``He maintains it's
because of age,'' says a fellow FAS member; Stone will turn 65 next
year. But the word is that Stone is actually leaving because of
negative fallout from l'affaire Morrison _ Stone's very public
accusation that his mentor and FAS colleague, Philip Morrison of
MIT, spied for the Russians during the Cold War. Princeton
physicist Frank von Himmel commented that ``it would be surprising
if this distressing episode did not play a role in firming up
Stone's decision to step down.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone, who has defended his father, the crusading journalist I.
F. Stone against accusations that he was a KGB Cold War
``contact,'' fingered Morrison in a book and subsequent newspaper
article last spring. Morrison denied the charges, and the FAS
issued a statement ``fully crediting'' Morrison's denials. In an
interview, Stone declined to talk about Morrison. He said he was
``ecstatic'' about his life change. He is leaving to head up an
organization devoted to public diplomacy, called Catalytic
Diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   The FAS was orginally the Association of Los Alamos Scientists
(ALAS), a group mainly comprised of physicists worried about the
destructive potential of the atomic arms race. The FAS may reorient
its interests away from arms control, judging by the short list of
candidates for Stone's job. Only one _ Bruce Blair of the Brookings
Institution _ has the conventional FAS background. The other two
candidates, the Department of Energy's Allan Hoffman, and Henry
Kelly, currently on the White House staff, both have expertise in
global energy issues.

A NEWS PHOTO TOUCHES A FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ To newspaper readers, it was a touching Associated
Press photograph of a homeless man, wrapped in a blanket and
shaking hands with Mayor Thomas M. Menino. But for one Uxbridge
man, it was the key that led to a reunion with his missing brother.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday morning, Brian Goodwin, 52, received a call from
his sister-in-law asking him to check out a photograph in the
Telegram &AMP; Gazette of Worcester. The man in the picture was his
long-lost brother, Scott.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was no mistake _ the name, the age, the face,'' said Brian
Goodwin during a telephone interview Thursday. ``We all kind of
chuckled and said, `Damn.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after his mother's death in 1986, Scott Goodwin, 49,
left the family's Ashland home and never returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Thanksgiving we would say, `Oh, Scott is going to call,
and we will pick him up in Framingham,' but the call never came,''
Brian said.
</P>
<P>
   As the years passed, the family assumed that their brother, the
second oldest of five children, had either moved to California to
pursue his dream of becoming a drummer or died on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   It was at about 11 p.m. Monday when AP photographer Elise
Amendola and a reporter spotted Scott outside a doughnut shop. They
were assigned to follow the mayor during the city's annual homeless
census.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Scott) was the first or second person we ecountered in the
storefront alley in Downtown Crossing,'' Amendola said. ``He was
under his blanket reading a book. All of his stuff was piled around
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor asked Scott, who was reading a book of science
fiction, if he wanted shelter, but he refused, saying shelters were
unsafe, recalled Amendola.
</P>
<P>
   Scott would be the focus of a subsequent AP article on
homelessness, but Amendola never expected to hear from him again.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, AP reporter Robin Estrin answered a phone call
from Brian Goodwin, who wanted to know where the photograph of his
brother was taken, so he could locate him.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, Estrin and Amendola led Brian to the Washington
Street area where his brother was sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   Scott wasn't there, but Amendola recalled that the homeless man
sold newspapers for The Boston Globe. As they moved toward Boston
Common, Brian asked a man wearing a Globe jacket if he knew his
brother; the man directed the three to Scott's newsstand at North
Station.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got a newspaper for your brother?'' asked Brian after spotting
his younger brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott looked blank. It has been 12 years,'' said Amendola.
``Brian takes off his baseball cap and says, `It's your brother,'
and slowly he recognizes him and stands up and they hug.''
</P>
<P>
   In a few minutes, the two men try to catch up with all the
missing years: Scott said he'd been meaning to call, but somehow
life got in the way. The family scholar, Scott dropped out of the
University of Massachustts at Amherst, used drugs, and moved to a
commune in Cambridge, according to the AP.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, Scott lost his apartment and has been homeless ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was on the National Honor Society in Ashland High School,''
recalled Brian. ``He was always real studious. We thought, `He's
got it made, always able to breeze through everthing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, Scott fulfilled his dream of moving from Ashland to
Boston. He worked odd jobs and returned home for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never tried to lecture him, but just let him be himself,''
Brian said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Scott returned to the family's Ashland home but left
after an argument with his father. Months grew into years of
absence.
</P>
<P>
   Brian told his younger brother that their father died in April.
Scott said he had stopped using drugs years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the reunion, the two brothers looked at several
rooming houses in the Beacon Hill area. ``He won't go into a
shelter. He said it's more dangerous than on the streets '' said
Brian, who is married with three adult children. He offered his
brother a place in his home, but Scott refused, explaining that he
had a job to do.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Brian bought his brother dinner and gave him money.
They expect to unite with another sibling Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not expecting him to work at Microsoft,'' Brian said. ``If
he wants to sell Globes until he is 80 years old, that's fine with
me _ as along as he is happy.''

PAINFUL QUESTIONS IN WORCESTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Worcester firefighters pay a final salute to their six fallen
comrades, one chapter of this hellish tragedy draws to a painful
close. There are more to come.
</P>
<P>
   The personal pain of family and friends will, of course,
continue without end. But one piece of the tragedy that will run a
very specific course is the criminal case against Thomas Levesque,
37, and Julie Barnes, 19. They allegedly knocked over a candle
during an argument inside the Worcester Cold Storage &AMP; Warehouse
Co. building and left without reporting the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Does it diminish the self-sacrifice and heroism of the dead
firefighters to question the involuntary manslaughter charges
brought against Levesque and Barnes? I don't think so, but others
may. I will ask it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Globe published a photograph of Linda McGuirk,
the widow of Worcester firefighter Joseph T. McGuirk, with her
young children, Emily and Everett. Their faces break your heart.
Beneath their glazed, solemn gazes was a photograph of Barnes.
Waiflike in baggy jeans and chains around her ankles, she also
looked numb, obviously for different reasons: She is 19, three
months pregnant, and, according to a court psychologist, competent
to stand trial on six counts of involuntary manslaughter in
connection with the Dec. 3 fire.
</P>
<P>
   According to a story published in the Worcester Telegram &AMP;
Gazette, Barnes had the troubled childhood you would expect from
such a lost-looking soul. She and a sister spent their early
childhood with their mother, but by 1985 the state Department of
Social Services stepped in after reports of sexual abuse and
neglect. She had no friends and would wait on the back steps for a
next-door neighbor to get home from work. For a time she lived with
her father, a Worcester cabdriver, in a bedroom decorated with
Barbie dolls. Described as slow, she never graduated from high
school.
</P>
<P>
   She left home at 18 and ended up in a relationship with
Levesque, who had previously dated her aunt. Levesque, who has a
record of violent assaults on women, is still undergoing
psychiatric evaluation at Bridgewater State Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A troubled life does not give anyone license to commit a crime.
Still, the heartbreak of six deaths and 17 fatherless children does
not necessarily add up to a manslaughter conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes and Levesque apparently started a fire but did not intend
to kill anyone. The legal question turns on whether they engaged in
reckless conduct that a reasonable person might conclude could lead
to the death of another person. Not surprisingly, the nuances are
subject to legal argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to say they should be responsible for the fire.
But to charge them with responsibility for the deaths? It's a
little bit much,'' says defense lawyer Harvey Silverglate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some prosecutors believe they have a duty and a right to
charge the most serious offense the facts will bear. However,
responsible prosecutors have the view that they have a professional
obligation to charge the highest, most serious offense that 12 out
of 12 jurors would convict on.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyer R. Robert Popeo says manslaughter charges are
technically correct but might not have been brought if prosecutors
had ``the luxury of time to be able to look at it with detached
reflection.'' Adds Popeo: ``What we see now are two homeless people
who knocked over a candle, couldn't put it out, and took off. If
that's all there was, it's a very hard case of involuntary
manslaughter.''
</P>
<P>
   But Popeo stresses that other factors, as they become known,
begin to weigh in: How much did Barnes and Levesque know about the
extent of the fire when they left the warehouse? How foreseeable
was it for them to think people would be killed in what they knew
to be an abandoned building? Is the ``reasonable man'' standard
really applicable in this case, given the intellectual capabilities
of the defendants?
</P>
<P>
   There are painful questions for other people as well.
</P>
<P>
   City officials knew that homeless people stayed in the building.
Why did they allow the practice to continue for so long? What is
the responsibility of the building's owner? The vacant 82-year-old
warehouse lacked fireproofing, automatic sprinklers, and fire and
smoke alarms, according to the Telegram &AMP; Gazette. It was awaiting
renovation into a biomedical park. In the interim, it was a
firetrap and, ultimately, a death trap.
</P>
<P>
   The questions haunt, as do all the faces from Worcester.

A MALE FANTASTY WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
BICENTENNIAL MAN 
Directed by: Chris Columbus 
Screenplay by: Nicholas Kazan (based on Isaac Asimov's short story
and Asimov's and Robert Silverberg's novel, ``The Positronic
Man'') 
Starring: Robin Williams, Sam Neill, Embeth Davidtz, Oliver Platt,
Wendy Crewson, Hallie Kate Eisenberg, Stephen Root, Lynne Thigpen,
Bradley Whitford, Kiersten Warren 
Running time: 132 minutes 
Rated: PG (language and some sexual content) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Bicentennial Man'' is the kind of movie that makes you wish
Robin Williams would say enough with the touchy-feely stuff
already. Still, it seems only fair to add that the fans who liked
him in ``Mrs. Doubtfire'' and ``Patch Adams'' will like him, here,
too, as a sensitive robot. At least if it plays pretty shamelessly
to the sensitive and sentimental side of his persona, it's also
darker than the cute robotic kids' movie it at first may seem.
Basically, Williams plays a robot with soul. Brains, too, and not
for a moment is ``Bicentannial Man'' out of touch with a long line
of beauty-and-the-beast movies in which somebody outside the human
race teaches a human being, usually a pretty girl, what humanity is
all about.
</P>
<P>
   Does this sound a tad cynical? If so, it's because Williams'
robot winds up falling in love with the granddaughter of the little
girl whose family originally bought him, thinking they were
purchasing little more than a glorified household appliance. But
not this robot. Beneath his plastic and metal exterior, he's not
just smart, but full of feeling, and the feelings only get deeper.
His feelings for a member of the third generation of the family
he's connected to seem a little uncomfortably akin to an old man's
Viagra fantasy, but Williams' persona _ and the way the story is
set up _ make it all palatable, if only just.
</P>
<P>
   Right off, the robot named Andrew announces holographically that
he's been programmed never to harm any human. Many, many years and
a few reprogrammings later, when he's looking into the eyes of a
woman who's the better part of a century younger with a wish to do
more than just serve her, this ground rule yanks the scene back
from any sort of
King-Kong-clutching-Fay-Wray-atop-the-Empire-State-Building danger.
Still, while we're used to older male stars getting much younger
female stars, this is a bit of a stretch. What helps is that Andrew
has really worked his way up the scale of demands very slowly and
very reasonably. It starts with him getting his own bank account
when he puts his skills to work and makes money manufacturing
exquisitely crafted clocks.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, he's gotta be free, and, hey, this is America,
right? When he does get his freedom, Andrew the robot never gets
manic and clangs his heels together. He even looks a little sad
about it, and assures his ``family'' that he'll always be close by.
Here the film veers into some rich irony. Because Andrew is made of
high-grade alloys, he's virtually ageless, given regular
servicings. But because he's an American man who acquires some
disposable income, he puts it into approving his appearance,
draping enough artificial skin and hair over his steely exoskeleton
to make him look like Robin Williams. And not just any Robin
Williams, but Robin Williams just back from a health spa.

   And yet ``Bicentannial Man'' puts a very agreeable and even
disarming face on its understandable but not so lovely male
fantasy. Few actors apart from Williams could bring it off. Of
course, part of the reason he's able to is that the robot is
expressionless, which means Williams is able to underplay a lot. So
what he wants never seems assaultive. This encourages us to
sympathize with his essential isolation, even if the film is a
little remiss in pointing out that loneliness is often the price of
freedom. Still, I found it very tempting to just go along with the
prettiness and the mellowspeak that are the medium of exchange in
``Bicentennial Man.'' Williams makes us feel there's enough good
will behind it to really preclude anyone hating it. Still, I wish
the film had found the courage to really grapple with the
conundrums accompanying the advent of artificial intelligence and
not just play them out on the level of how the sweet, brilliant
dork is going to get the girl.

ANNA AND THE KING 
Directed by: Andy Tennant 
Screenplay by: Steve Meerson &AMP; Peter Krikes (based on Anna
Leonowens' diaries)

<P>
   ``Anna and the King'' is a lot more than ``The King and I''
minus Rodgers' and Hammerstein's music. It's a broader, wider,
deeper, fuller canvas. A big, handsome throwback to star-powered
historical costume movies, it relies on the charisma of Jodie
Foster and Chow Yun-Fat and a screenful of spectacular production
values to carry it past its inevitable political incorrectness.
While there's more than a little sensitivity training between the
new ``Anna and the King'' and the macho ``King and I'' of Yul
Brunner, both proceed from the same source, the diaries of Anna
Leonowens, a British schoolteacher who journeyed from India to what
was then called Siam and taught the 70-odd children and several
concubines of Siam's King Mongkut in the 1860s.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the film retains an Anglo-centric point of view that
contributed to its being deemed unwelcome in Thailand (filming took
place in Malaysia). That the real Anna Leonowens was a remarkable
woman is beyond dispute. That the proud king was willing to take
many a cue from her (except in public) remains debatable. And only
in Hollywood, not Siam, could she all but save the Siamese royal
family. But she almost certainly reinforced the progressive outlook
that led to the king having sent for her. He realized he would have
to bring his country into the modern world, propgate scientific and
linguistic studies, and thread his way carefully through the
diplomatic waters if he was to avoid being colonized.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just star power that the two leads bring to the table.
Not since Holly Hunter in ``The Piano'' have we seen so
strong-willed a Victorian woman on a movie screen as Foster is.
Foster is never going to do unintelligent work. Here she generates
sympathy by letting us see Anna's brave bluffing when she stands up
to the king and demands to be treated with respect (of course, this
being a romantic fantasy, he respects her). We also believe in the
feelings she and the king develop for one another. Their imapct is
all the greater for the restraint each must show, given their more
than slightly melancholy mutual acknowledment that their feelings
must be kept under wraps.
</P>
<P>
   Anna, as it happens, keeps her feelings rather too completely
under wraps. She's at least partly in denial about her husband's
death. And her high-mindedness sometimes comes off as mere
high-handedness. Although she's a liberalizing force, and rightly
maintains her position with unfaltering rectitude, she's also, one
feels, a bit narrow in her perspective, not as open to newness as
the king. He's a lot more receptive to Western thought than she is
to Asian viewpoints, which she almost automatically regards as
benighted, a view not entirely free of colonial arrogance. What she
does contribute in abundance, though, is character. She's not just
headstrong. She's strong, period, even if her liberal ideas could
just as readily be applied to Victorian England as to Siam.
</P>
<P>
   If she were any less powerful, in fact, the film would be stolen
away by Chow. What he contributes in prodigious amounts is warmth
and vision and shrewdness. He's too intelligent to indulge in macho
posturing. In fact, he's admirable in his realistic awareness of
how fragile his rule really is, and how possible it would be to
find himself overthrown. We can believe he spent part of his youth
in a Buddhist monastery. His eyes convey more feeling than his
position permits him to say. Even when turns Anna down for
political or other reasons, his eyes tell us he wishes he could
find a way to do what she asks. The one thing he doesn't have to
take lessons from Anna in is dignity. In short, Chow does a superb
job of convincing us that he's a wise king as well as a good one,
and more sophisticated than Anna in the bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the smartest decision made by director Andy Tennant was
to not twist the film out of shape by trying to avoid being
old-fashioned. ``Anna and the King'' is nothing but old-fashioned,
but it's old-fashioned in a glorious way. The Malaysian locales
serve splendidly for Siam, with its emphasis on gold and pointy
decor. The other performances are fine, too, especially those of
Bai Ling as the beleaguered Tuptim, resisting her fate as a
concubine, and 12-year-old Keith Chin, as the number one prince
whose searching eyes carry forward his father's faraway look. The
film also avoids stereotypes of Asian exoticism based on a
patronizing view of it as a toy culture. Still, it's eye-filling
when it has to be. ``Anna and the King'' is as enlightned and as
appealing a telling of this tale as we're likely to get.

`ROADS' RECAPTURES DEAD'S LIVE SOUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since the end of the Grateful Dead in 1995, one fact has become
abundantly clear: It's not easy to be a good jam band. While
Phish's improvisation has a buoyant elasticity, and some of the
Dead offshoot bands _ particularly the various incarnations of Phil
&AMP; Friends _ have risen well above the nostalgia factory, none of
the keepers of the flame have a fire that burns quite as brightly
as the Dead's, at its hottest moments. The rock 'n' roll
conversation of Jerry Garcia, Phil Lesh, Bob Weir, and Bill
Kreutzmann is one of those inventions that started off as an
accident but ended up as something inevitable, unique, and quite
impossible to imitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``So Many Roads (1965-1995),'' a new five-CD boxed set, is an
ambitiously edited attempt to chronicle the growth of this
ever-changing musical conversation. It's the sort of project _ an
aural biography of jamming _ that could only be done on the
Grateful Dead, and it comes closer to capturing the band than any
of the ``greatest'' Dead collections like ``What a Long Strange
Trip It's Been.'' It's a rough-hewn but carefully thought out
collage, mostly comprised of concert recordings reaching from the
short-lived ``You Don't Have to Ask'' at the Fillmore in 1966 to
the elegiac ``So Many Roads'' at the Dead's final concert in 1995.
These live selections _ some of them snippets of longer pieces _
are interspersed with unreleased studio material, notably
early-1990s songs like ``Eternity'' and ``Days Between'' that had
yet to be included on an album when Garcia died.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the pre-1980 live cuts are extraordinary, if not
definitive. Each one bookmarks a different stage in the band's
early musical development, from the full-frontal acid playing of
the late 1960s to the cosmic space journeying of the early 1970s.
On ``The Same Thing'' jamming from 1967, you can hear Garcia segue
from traditional blues riffs into the fiercely modern enterprise
that he will later perfect. Surprisingly, the Dead's most famous
jam vehicle, ``Dark Star,'' is represented by a speedy 1968 version
that only hints at the open-ended exploration the song will later
inspire. But it flows into an interestingly primitive ``China Cat
Sunflower'' and then into a scorching ``Eleven'' that fairly drips
with the night's energy. The ``Watkins Glen Soundcheck Jam'' from
1973 reveals a band that has fully fleshed out its own jazz-rock
sound, with a final third that is so uplifting it should be named
``Happy Jam.'' And one of the boxed set's peaks is a 1974
improvisation that plows through ``Spanish Jam'' and into ``U.S.
Blues'' on the ballast of Phil Lesh's ferocious bass lines. It's
the Dead in fifth gear, in the last months of its most inspired
era.
</P>
<P>
   Like the band, the boxed set loses some of its magic as it
reaches into the 1980s. Or at least, the magic changes, with a
shift in keyboardists, with the 1977 return of second drummer
Mickey Hart (who had left in 1971), with the unwieldy expansion of
the Dead's audience, and with the very beginnings of the malaise
that would haunt Garcia until his death. Gone are the ragtime riffs
and bright tinklings of Keith Godchaux, replaced by the synthetic
arena-rock intonations of Brent Mydland. An ``Estimated Prophet''
from 1979 gives us Mydland at his best, as his solos build
seamlessly into some classic Garcia, but the inclusion of a pair of
Mydland-sung tunes from the 1980s is unfortunate. So is an
unremarkable ``Scarlet Begonias _ Fire on the Mountain'' from 1990,
included to feature Garcia toying with MIDI technology. The
strongest jams from the Mydland era are an eerie, self-enclosed
``Playing in the Band'' and a gorgeously twisted ``Bird Song'' that
has the Dead diving headlong into fusion madness with Branford
Marsalis.
</P>
<P>
   The boxed set's most poignant moments are on its 1990s disc,
which could double as the Dead's final album of new material. As
music, these pieces aren't amazing; as Dead history, they are
essential. The most engaging latter-day song is ``Liberty,'' which
is well represented with a live version from 1994. And a
fascinating fly-on-the-wall rehearsal cut has Garcia drawing his
bandmates into an impromptu version of the Irish folk tune
``Whiskey in the Jar.'' The disc and the entire set ends with
Garcia singing his ailing heart out on his last-ever ``So Many
Roads,'' a song that calls to mind Dylan's ``Knockin' on Heaven's
Door.'' A month later, he was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``So Many Roads (1965-1995)'' summarizes three decades of Dead
as much as any five-disc set possibly can. Yes, it's too bad the
producers fade in and out of jams, a technique that Deadheads
continue to debate on the Internet. But it was an unhappy necessity
when faced with a band whose most intensely synchronized moments
were often in the middle of aimless noodling, or worse. With
cutting and pasting, we are able to hear small, telling gems that
might have fallen into the void, like the piercing ``Beautiful
Jam'' from 1971, or Garcia's fluttering 1990 foray with Bruce
Hornsby, ``Jam Out of Foolish Heart.'' And anyway, the truest
portrait of Dead music is coming out bit by bit, with the archival
releases known as ``Dick's Picks'' (of which there are 15 so far).
They are where the spaciest and spookiest and most sparkling
versions of ``Dark Star'' can live and breathe, and that's where
Deadheads can continue to mine for the gold.

A DENSE, RICH `CIDER HOUSE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE CIDER HOUSE RULES 
Directed by: Lasse Hallstrom 
Screenplay by: John Irving, based on his novel 
Starring: Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron, Delroy Lindo, Paul Rudd,
Michael Caine, Jane Alexander, Kathy Baker, Kieran Culkin, Kate
Nelligan, Heavy D, K. Todd Friedman, Paz de la Huerta, Erykah Badu 
Running time: 131 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (mature thematic elements, sexuality, nudity,
substance abuse and some violence) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Cider House Rules'' is the best film to date of a John
Irving novel. The author, who does not lightly bestow his
imprimatur, would have only himself to blame if it weren't. He
wrote its screenplay. As he himself says, he could telescope it
with a license unavailable to other writers. Irving clinches it by
appearing at the start and finish of the film as the stationmaster
of a Maine town. Although he has no lines, he emits the vibe of a
man who enjoys the opportunity he has afforded himself to scowl
disapprovingly, secure in the knowledge that his frowns are likely
to be the only ones that coalesce around ``The Cider House Rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all of Irving's tales, this one, which unfolds in the
1940s, is densely packed, and it confronts some bleak New England
realities. At its heart is the surrogate son-surrogate father
relationship between Tobey Maguire's orphan named Homer and Michael
Caine's kindly orphanage doctor. He takes the boy under his wing
and turns him into a junior colleague who helps care for his fellow
orphans and abandoned babies. The orphanage scenes were shot at the
Northampton State Hospital and at Ventfort, one of those
millionaire's houses in the Berkshires, referred to in a piquant
piece of reverse ostentation as cottages.
</P>
<P>
   The very architecture, and the spaces in it, add to the vibe of
a film that asks, among other things, what is to be done with
unwanted children, especially the ones who aren't so fortunate as
to live under the loving care of the caring staff run by the caring
doc, who bolsters their little egos by addressing them at bedtime
as princes of New England, without the smallest speck of irony. The
closest to controversy the film comes is in the doc's emphatic
pro-choice beliefs. He performs illegal abortions on the grounds
that many of the pregnant women who come to him would die at the
hands of backstreet abortionists in a time when abortion is a
criminal offense.
</P>
<P>
   Homer, protege though he may be, disagrees with the
large-hearted doc's abortion policy on philosophical grounds and
won't assist in the operations. Otherwise, we're convinced the bond
between them is deep and loving. This is due to the exceptional
performances of Maguire and Caine, and the ability of Swedish
director Lasse Hallstrom to infuse with gentleness and lyricism the
harshest of environments. At first, it's a little disconcerting to
hear Caine speak in an American accent, but it isn't long before he
drapes the doc's profound compassion over us and enchants us with
his matter-of-fact saintliness.
</P>
<P>
   Maguire has made the transition from teen roles to young-man
roles without missing a beat. Unlike many actors, he's not afraid
of quiet, and he's not afraid to hold back. This comes at no cost
to our belief in his sensitivity, and, in this case, essential
goodness. His open face tells us, as Homer moves out into the
world, that while there's a lot he doesn't know, he wants to know
it, and that even though he treads softly, he's an eager pupil. In
short, Homer is a blank page but hardly a blank person when he
disappoints the doc by not immediately slipping into a role as the
doc's successor. Instead, he goes off to see the world when he's
offered a lift by a GI who had brought his girlfriend to the doc
for an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Homer isn't taken that far down the road in miles (by the most
remarkable of coincidences Maguire plays another young man taking a
different kind of journey in the Civil War drama, ``Ride With the
Devil,'' also opening Friday). Nevertheless, he winds up a world
away from the orphanage. He's given a job on the apple farm
belonging to the departing GI's mother and yes, Homer does indeed
eat from the tree of knowledge, if you were wondering about the
symbolism. Homer, in fact, learns more than he counted on. Some of
it he learns from Southern migrant workers headed by a proud Delroy
Lindo, who has a grown daughter played by Erykah Badu, in a strong
debut. The title comes from a list of dos and don'ts nailed on a
wall of the workers' bunkhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Rules, of course, are one of the things Homer has to figure out,
including which are to be broken and which are not, and what's to
be done if they are. Complicating matters is that Homer has eyes
for his benefactor's girlfriend, a lobsterman's daughter played by
Charlize Theron with a disarming down-to-earth quality to go with
her sexiness. Homer's grappling with moral choices is classic
coming-of-age stuff, and the film handles it beautifully. ``The
Cider House Rules'' is Hallstrom in his ``My Life As a Dog'' and
``What's Eating Gilbert Grape?'' mode. Given a choice between
overplaying and underplaying, it always underplays, which is part
of its charm. Certainly, it's filled with vivid characters and
action. Beneath its modesty of gesture, it's one of the year's
richest, most humane films.

THINKING INSIDE THE BOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new standard for boxed sets was notched up by Bruce
Springsteen, whose four-CD ``Tracks'' redefined the genre last
year. His box contained all previously unreleased songs or
alternate takes _ many of which had fans salivating. This year's
boxed crop is less enticing and less adventurous, though not
without a few hearty recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best new releases come from outside the rock 'n'
roll field _ notably, boxes by Stevie Wonder and Sammy Davis Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, it's a mixed bag, weighted down by the hit-and-miss
quality of new sets by the Doobie Brothers, Linda Ronstadt, and
Harry Chapin. Clearly, some of these don't generate the excitement
of previous, higher-profile sets by the likes of Bob Dylan, Led
Zeppelin, Eric Clapton, Tom Petty, and, of course, Springsteen.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, this season will be remembered for the granddaddy of
boxed sets _ a 26-CD Sony Records retrospective (``Soundtrack for a
Century'') that retails for a gaudy $300 and is so weighty you
virtually need a wheelbarrow to lug it around. This is truly a gift
for the music lover who has everything.
</P>
<P>
   Let us proceed to specifics:
</P>
<P>
   Sony Music 100 Years: ``Soundtrack for a Century.'' We kid you
not about the heft of this thing. It's the ultimate vanity project
by Sony Records _ spanning 547 songs from 479 of its artists dating
all the way back to 1889 when the label was known as the Columbia
Phonograph Co. The set includes double CDs representing every genre
from country to world music (which can be purchased as two-CD sets
apart from the box). The breadth is mind-boggling. The country set
runs from Fiddlin' John Carson's ``Little Old Log Cabin in the
Lane'' in 1923 to the Dixie Chicks' ``Wide Open Spaces'' in 1997.
And what other box contains tracks by Al Jolson, the Dorsey
Brothers, and Pearl Jam? Too many artists are restricted to a
single song, but it's a fascinating compilation nonetheless. And it
comes with a 308-page book filled with essays about the development
of music and technology. You can spend a lot of time with this box,
which has 40 hours of music alone.
</P>
<P>
   Stevie Wonder, ``At the Close of a Century,'' Motown. The appeal
of a good boxed set is that it forces us to reexamine an artist.
Sometimes that's painful if the artist doesn't have enough material
to fill a quality box (see the following reviews of the Doobies and
Chapin), but it's a joy in the case of Wonder. His growth from
being a precocious 12-year-old scoring a hit with ``Fingertips Pts
1 &AMP; 2,'' to a groundbreaking fusionist mixing funk, psychedelia,
and spirituality is astonishing. He also got the best out of such
guests as the Jackson 5, Minnie Riperton, Paul Anka (!), and pedal
steel ace Sneaky Pete Kleinow from the Flying Burrito Brothers.
Occasionally, Wonder played every instrument on his songs, and his
attempts to embrace outside styles such as Latin music were way
ahead of his time. Sadly, the box lacks previously unissued tunes
or alternate takes but still merits high marks.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Davis Jr., ``Yes I Can! The Sammy Davis Jr. Story,''
Warner Archives/Rhino. Davis wasn't called Mr. Entertainment for
nothing. The son of a vaudeville dancer, Davis was touring by age 8
_ one memorable show had him opening at Boston's Plymouth Theatre
for Bill ``Bojangles'' Robinson _ and his ability as a song
interpreter is captured skillfully on this box. Although often
viewed as a campy singer, Davis had a more thoughtful way than he's
given credit for with show tunes and jazz standards. He ranged
easily from the songbooks of George and Ira Gershwin to Johnny
Mercer and Rodgers and Hart. Enjoyable collaborations are found
with Frank Sinatra and Count Basie (in a track produced by Quincy
Jones), but the central figure is Sammy and his sheer,
finger-snapping joy with life. His positive attitude was contagious
_ as revealed in one of these four CDs that deals only with live
performances.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Ronstadt, ``Box Set,'' Elektra. Ronstadt has had an
eclectic career, but this box goes overboard in trumpeting that
eclecticism. The problem is not that she's recorded everything from
country to classical in her career. It's the sequencing of the
songs. Instead of going chronologically, the box uses reverse
chronology (the first song is a John Hiatt cover, ``When We Ran,''
from 1998), which immediately shakes up the listener. So does the
too-clever sequencing of her cover of Neil Young's ``After the Gold
Rush,'' followed by a duet with Frank Sinatra (``Moonlight in
Vermont''), then a Mexican song, ``El Camino.'' Sorry, it doesn't
work. And there are many other examples. It would have been better
to divide the four CDs into distinct genres. However, the last CD,
``Rarities,'' is interesting and has three songs she did for Randy
Newman's opera, ``Faust,'' along with a live track with bluegrass
group the Seldom Scene.
</P>
<P>
   Doobie Brothers, ``Long Train Runnin','' Warner Archives/Rhino.
The Doobies have had some great hits from their guitar-centered,
hippie-mongering '70s era (``China Grove'' and ``Black Water'' jump
out), as well as their more polished late '70s and early '80s
period when Michael McDonald took over on keyboards and sang ``What
A Fool Believes.'' But each era saw plenty of filler _ and too much
of it is on this box. Also problematic is a fourth CD of
``Abandoned Tracks _ Demos and Roughs.'' Rough is the operative
word, because many tracks should have stayed abandoned. The only
discoveries are a couple of Patrick Simmons' Leo Kottke-like guitar
instrumentals. The Bay Area Doobies would have been better served
to tighten up this box into two or three CDs, not four.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Chapin, ``Story of a Life,'' Elektra/Rhino. Chapin was a
folk-pop troubadour who will be forever known for his
irony-drenched hits, ``Taxi'' (about driving a cab and picking up a
former girlfriend) and ``Cat's in the Cradle,'' a bittersweet tale
about a father who ignores his son, then is ignored by the son when
the latter reaches adulthood. But Chapin did not have enough
high-end songs to merit a box. Some tunes sound hopelessly hammy
(such as ``30,000 Pounds of Bananas'') and overproduced. Chapin
wrote some strong story-songs, but he was still a work in progress
when he died in a car accident in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Marley, ``Songs of Freedom,'' Tuff Gong. This is a new
reissue (with new packaging) of a Marley box that originally came
out in 1992. It's worth mentioning again, because it's a landmark
box that doesn't settle for the familiar recordings of his hits
(from ``I Shot the Sheriff'' to ``No Woman, No Cry''), but instead
includes some live versions and some 12-inch mixes. Jamaican
singer/prophet Marley still sounds vital, right up to a taping of
his eloquent ``Redemption Song,'' recorded in his final concert in
Pittsburgh. ``Emancipate yourself from mental slavery,'' he says in
classic Marley style.

   Farmers may need to douse their fields with yet more pesticides
to get the best out of genetically modified plants. At least,
that's the implication of patent applications filed by Novartis of
Basle in Switzerland, one of the leading companies in the field.
</P>
<P>
   The applications (WO 99/35910 and WO 99/35913) were filed after
scientists at Novartis realized that a wide spectrum of insect
pests was attacking Bt maize, its major genetically modified crop.
Genes inserted into the maize enable it to make the Bt toxin, a
bacterial protein that kills European corn borer larvae. These
larvae chew their way into the stems of young maize plants and can
kill them before they get established.
</P>
<P>
   But many genetically modified plants that saw off the borer
larvae were later attacked by sap-sucking insects. ``Bt toxin has a
rather narrow spectrum of activity, so you don't get control of all
pests,'' says Walter Smolders, head of patents at Novartis Seeds.
</P>
<P>
   To find a way round the problem, Novartis scientists tried
applying different combinations of the company's pesticides to the
Bt maize. Their patents identify combinations of pesticides that
could raise yields of the maize by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The same pesticides appear to increase the yields of other
genetically modified plants, including those engineered to resist
the effects of herbicides. So, Novartis has extended its patents to
cover use of the pesticides on a long list of transgenic crops
including maize, cereals, soya beans, potatoes, rice, cotton and
mustard. If the patents are granted, this means they will also
apply to crops from competitors such as St. Louis-based Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   Heinz Hammann, head of patents in Novartis' crop protection
division, claims the pesticides mentioned in the patents are mostly
environmentally benign, killing only the pests which attack the
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Maize, for example, is vulnerable to sapsuckers such as the flea
beetle (Phyllotreta agriotes) and various aphids. ``Nontarget
species don't suck the plants, so they're not harmed,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the pesticides are less friendly. Carbamates, for
example, act on the nervous system of pests and are known to affect
birds, fish, game, bees, mammals and other farmland wildlife. And
given that agribiotech firms have consistently argued that
genetically modified crops will reduce pesticide use, Novartis'
patent applications are sure to be seized upon by groups that
oppose the technology.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Johnson, head of the biotechnology advisory unit at
English Nature, a conservation watchdog, says he wants to see
evidence confirming Novartis' suggestion that the use of pesticides
on genetically modified crops outlined in its patent applications
will be less environmentally damaging than conventional chemical
treatment of ordinary maize. ``It's the impact of the whole process
on biodiversity that counts,'' he says. ``But the impacts of what
they are proposing are not known.''  &QL;

   Farmers may need to douse their fields with yet more pesticides
to get the best out of genetically modified plants. At least,
that's the implication of patent applications filed by Novartis of
Basle in Switzerland, one of the leading companies in the field.
</P>
<P>
   The applications (WO 99/35910 and WO 99/35913) were filed after
scientists at Novartis realized that a wide spectrum of insect
pests was attacking Bt maize, its major genetically modified crop.
Genes inserted into the maize enable it to make the Bt toxin, a
bacterial protein that kills European corn borer larvae. These
larvae chew their way into the stems of young maize plants and can
kill them before they get established.
</P>
<P>
   But many genetically modified plants that saw off the borer
larvae were later attacked by sap-sucking insects. ``Bt toxin has a
rather narrow spectrum of activity, so you don't get control of all
pests,'' says Walter Smolders, head of patents at Novartis Seeds.

THAT'S (KIDS') ENTERTAINMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What would Christmas be without parents bemoaning the mindless
drift of their children's entertainment? And who could blame them,
what with the endless procession of Beanie Babies, Teletubbies,
Barneys, Mutant Turtles, and whoever those mystical morons were
from the last ``Star Wars'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   Well, bah me no humbugs, but suddenly the kids' stuff is all
right. More than all right, in fact; children's entertainment seems
awash in a sea of faddish creativity. Of the three humongous fads
of the day only the religious right and the politically correct
left could be upset by the three Harry Potter books or the second
``Toy Story'' movie. Pokemon is perhaps a horse, or whatever those
creatures are, of another color, but even this phenomenon _ the
collecting, not the animation _ has something to say for it. Not
only is each of the three of them instructive on its own level, but
recalls the joys of the fads from childhoods past _ or at least one
childhood.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   HARRY POTTER
</P>
<P>
   The aforementioned muggles of the right and left _ who have more
in common with each other than they like to think _ are up in arms
that Harry Potter enchants children with tales of sorcery and
witchcraft. The key word, though, is ``enchant.'' With children so
seduced by television and computers, the sight of a child with his
or her head buried in any book other than ``How to Poison Your
Parents'' ought to elicit tears of joy.
</P>
<P>
   When the writer is as good as J. K. Rowling, parents should be
doubly encouraged. It is annoying that a publisher called
Scholastic would see fit to Americanize many references, even
changing the title of the first book from ``Philosopher's Stone''
to ``Sorcerer's Stone'' _ apparently philosphy is beyond Americans
_ but a trip to Amazon.com.UK can fix that. (It is amazingly easy
and relatively inexpensive to order the British books over the
Internet.)
</P>
<P>
   But Harry Potter is a charmer even in American English. You know
you're in the hands of a master storyteller who knows how to cozy
up to a kid from the opening paragraph: ``Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of
number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were
perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people
you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious,
because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Cinderella's stepmother and stepsisters, Mr. and Mrs.
Dursley and their son find themselves saddled with their nephew,
Harry, whom they treat like dirt. Harry, however, has magic in his
genes and is whisked away into a world of wizardry and
transmogrified animals. Empowerment and self-esteem, indeed. Some
parents would rather those things be learned in more down-to-earth
forms like noncompetitive athletics (talk about fantasy worlds),
but magical landscapes have always been a part of children's
literature, from ``The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' to ``The
NeverEnding Story'' and if the goal is to get children to read,
then even a good pagan like Harry is on the side of the angels this
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   My angel was a legendary teacher at Boston Latin School named
Joseph McNamara, who delighted in upending the rote-learning apple
cart so prevalent at that school in the 1960s when I was lucky
enough to have him as an English teacher. His reading list, which
was voluntary, shunned Shakespeare and Dickens and instead
suggested Bram Stoker's ``Dracula,'' Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock
Holmes mysteries, and H. Rider Haggard's adventures. (Latin School
was an all-boys school at the time. A Falstaffian figure like Joe
McNamara might not have survived in a coeducational institution,
which in itself is a great reason for keeping adolescent boys and
girls separate but equal.)
</P>
<P>
   Students who didn't know that a book could be read for pleasure
would be chowing down eight books a month, only partly because that
raised your grade 10 points. McNamara knew that if you hooked a kid
on Stoker he would graduate to Poe and then to Hawthorne. Entrance
him with the science fiction of A. E. Van Vogt and you open a door
onto the disciplines of science and fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of his former students are losing sleep reading
Dostoevski these days, but I wouldn't be surprised if almost every
one of them who takes a look at a child spellbound by Harry
Potter's days at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry has a
special wistfulness for Joe Mac's classes at Boston Latin.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   POKEMON
</P>
<P>
   Ash, the boy hero of ``Pokemon,'' leads a similarly enchanted
life, and devotees of the cards/video game/TV show/movie can also
find portals into, pardon the jargon, self-esteem and empowerment.
It is considerably harder, though, for adults to get excited about
whatever virtues it has, given its less literate and confusing (to
adults) story line and its awful animation. Perhaps, though, that's
part of the allure, that children have this special world of
communication that keeps parents out of the clubhouse. It's the
consumerism and addictiveness (``Gotta catch them all'') that
disturbs some parents, although Peggy Charren, the former head of
Action for Children's Television, tells of other parents who spend
their own money trying to buy rare cards for their children.
</P>
<P>
   Still, collecting cards seems to be a joyful part of childhood,
short of one of the little tykes getting your credit card number
and searching the Internet for some of those rare cards. (The
Internet, itself, is one of the ways that children can understand
this world and delight in its nooks and crannies in ways that give
them a special power over their parents.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a special power in having something your friends
don't have, which may not be a trait you want to foster in a child,
but probably isn't a sign that he or she will go psycho either. My
friends and I were obsessed with the cards based on the ``Davy
Crockett'' movies in the 1950s and I still can't suppress the glee
when I discovered that the cards were being released in Nantasket
before Boston and so I'd come back from weekends at the summer
rental being the cock of the walk with my complete sets (the orange
and the green series) of Davy Crockett cards.
</P>
<P>
   Charren isn't crazy about some elements of the Pokemon
phenomenon, like the creature with the fiery tale that might
inspire to light up one of their little toys. But Pokemon elicits
sympathetic thoughts from Charren as well, even in the way that
children derive status from them. ``I can relate the trading cards
personally to a game I played in the streets of New York.'' Charren
would pitch playing cards with drawings or paintings, everything
from comic strips to Thomas Gainsborough's ``The Blue Boy,'' in the
same way that children do with baseball cards. She was as adept at
that as she would later become at judging children's entertainment,
and wound up with the most valuable set around. ``One of the most
horrible things that ever happened to me,'' she says with a laugh
as well as a lament, ``was one day I came home from school and I
couldn't find them. My mother incinerated them. She thought I was
becoming obsessed. And I was the winner! I was the big cheese!''
</P>
<P>
   She does add, though, that these collections were valuable only
to the children who owned them and that the economics behind the
card companies' manipulativeness with Pokemon is ``nauseating.'' In
addition to children having to roam the Internet for rare cards,
you have to go to the movie four times to get the complete set of
``Pokemon'' cards that they give children with tickets. ``Some
kids, it has been witnessed, buy tickets to the movie and go home
after getting the cards. That's very manipulative. It's another
example of the corporate culture making their profits on the back
of kids.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   TOY STORY 2
</P>
<P>
   We can all find antecedents for Harry Potter and Pokemon, but
were there any movies as smart as the two ``Toy Story'' films from
Pixar and Disney? One might compare the anime of ``Princess
Mononoke'' to Disney's experiments with ``Fantasia,'' but there was
nothing like the mix of word and image in the '50s that there is in
``Toy Story 2.'' One can cavil, and probably should, at the
merchandising of the ``Toy'' toys, which the movie itself has some
fun with, but it's hard to be angry with a movie that so lovingly
and brilliantly captures the relationship between children and
their toys.
</P>
<P>
   It is the nature of the world we live in that obsolescence
travels at the speed of light, for Woody the cowboy toy as well as
cinematic technique. ``Toy Story 2'' puts its considerable heart on
the side of slowing down and appreciating everything for what it
is. Woody and Buzz Lightyear, the astronaut toy, becoming friends
instead of rivals in the first ``Toy Story'' is a great lesson in
finding common ground for children as well as questioning the modes
and mores of a disposable society.
</P>
<P>
   But we're getting too serious. ``Toy Story 2,'' like the Harry
Potter books, is most of all an ode to the powers of the
imagination, which takes on all the more power because it makes
such a fanciful world so credible. (It's Tom Hanks's most
believable role in years.) Perhaps we should say fanciful worlds,
because there are more worlds within worlds here than in ``Being
John Malkovich.'' The magic of ``Toy Story 2'' is in the blending
of the lives of the animated _ or pixilated _ people with the lives
of the toy people, toy creatures, and the merchandise created from
them, all the while adhering to the ``reality'' that directors John
Lasseter and Lee Unkrich have created. Thus a prospector from an
old ``Howdy Doody''-like show is trapped inside a box because it
was never opened.
</P>
<P>
   No children's entertainment is without its risks, though. If you
see the film, you might not let your kids get rid of any of their
toy clutter even if they want to.

J. GEILS BANDS TOGETHER FOR FIREFIGHTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The recent fire that claimed the lives of six Worcester
firefighters has hit home with the reunited J. Geils Band. The
Boston group took a break from rehearsals the other night to
discuss doing something for the families left behind by the
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got friends who are firemen,'' Geils singer Peter Wolf
recalls thinking.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a Geils decision to play a benefit for the
families on Dec. 29 at the Orpheum. Tickets go on sale Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seemed like a pertinent thing to do. It makes sense,
and it reminds me of a lot of the things that the Geils Band used
to do,'' says Wolf. ``I know the whole band feels good about this _
and it strengthens the sense of our reunion.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the last Geils gig before the group's long breakup was
a charity show at the Worcester Centrum in 1982 to benefit the Toys
for Tots campaign.
</P>
<P>
   That was back in the days when the Geils Band was a fixture at
New Year's Eve shows in the area _ playing at either the Boston
Garden, the Centrum, or the Providence Civic Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did it for 12-13 years straight,'' Wolf recalls.
</P>
<P>
   The band isn't playing a local New Year's gig this year because
the city of Detroit (the second most popular city for Geils)
grabbed it first. ``It would have been great to be in Boston, but
people in Detroit made the offer early on,'' Wolf says of the
group's commitment to play the Palace in Auburn Hills that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit asked early, but it's still nice that we can play in
Boston during holiday week,'' Wolf says of the Orpheum benefit.
Which raises the question: What about future Geils shows? Will the
reunion continue into next year?
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be no more shows or we could decide to do a bunch
more,'' says Wolf. ``We want this to be a labor of love and not
laborious.'' No long-term commitments have been made.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf has gone back to making a solo record (no Geils album has
been agreed upon, though Wolf is sure some label would be
interested), while guitarist J. Geils and harpist Magic Dick have
gone back to their band, Bluestime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way it's going right now is healthy. It allows people to
continue what they're doing,'' says Wolf. ``And we'll see what
happens.''

   Sister Kate resurfaces _ Kate Taylor, unlike her brothers James
and Livingston, has performed only sporadically through the years,
while focusing on the upbringing of her three daughters. She has,
however, just released a new single _ a compelling version of
``Auld Lang Syne'' with James on harmony _ that she's selling
through her Web site, http://www.katetaylor.com, as a holiday gift,
with some proceeds going to charity. The song is a prelude to a new
CD, ``Beautiful Road,'' due in early 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were thinking of a song to do last New Year's Eve at the
Old Whaling Church,'' Taylor says, referring to the Edgartown
church near her Martha's Vineyard home. ``And `Auld Lang Syne' came
up. No one knew what the lyrics were, so we got them from a
librarian on the island.'' Taylor's husband, Charlie Witham, then
adapted them from the original, written by Robert Burns.
</P>
<P>
   ``James came over to dinner last winter and we played it for
him. And when he got off the road in June, he came into the studio
and sang the harmony vocal,'' says Taylor, referring to Sonic
Brothers studio on the Vineyard _ in the basement of a building
where Kate actually lived in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   The single likewise features bassist Tony Garner (who coproduced
the record and is Bob Dylan's tour bassist) and violinist Mindy
Jostyn, who has worked with Carly Simon and Billy Joel.

   James on the Hall of Fame: Although he's never been principally
known as a rocker, James Taylor just won induction into the Rock
and Roll Hall of Fame (the ceremony is March 6 in Manhattan). ``I
was thrilled to even be considered, let alone selected,'' Taylor
says in a statement, before joking: ``I'm honored, especially
considering the other nominees. It's incredible. I demand a
recount.''

   Songs of the century: ``You've Lost that Lovin' Feelin','' a hit
for the Righteous Brothers, is the most played song of the century,
according to BMI, the performing rights group. BMI tallies the
number of performances on US radio and TV _ and the song has passed
the 8 million mark. It was written by Barry Mann, Phil Spector, and
Cynthia Weil. Following it, with 7 million performances, are
``Never My Love,'' ``Yesterday,'' and ``Stand By Me.'' Rounding out
the Top 10, with 6 million performances, are ``Can't Take My Eyes
Off of You,'' ``(Sittin' On) the Dock of the Bay,'' ``Mrs.
Robinson,'' ``Baby I Need Your Loving,'' ``Rhythm of the Rain,''
and ``Georgia On My Mind.''

JUXTAPOSITION, WIT INVIGORATE `MODERNISM' SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ Art museums haven't escaped the end-of-century urge
to take things apart and sum them up. Most of the resulting shows
exhaust you with good intentions, grand ambitions, murky thinking
and too many things.
 &HT;    The Museum of Modern Art _ which has been explaining its subject
since its founding in 1929, sometimes in a rather high-handed
fashion and not usually with a lot of wit _ has come up with a
delightful turn of the century show. Three shows, actually:
``People,'' ``Places,'' and ``Things,'' the game-show categories
sometimes stretched by the addition of abstraction. The umbrella
for the three, which had staggered openings but are now all up and
running, is ``ModernStarts,'' which is itself part of ``MoMA2000.''
(You knew the millennium had to figure into this somehow.) A series
of shows examining the 20th century through the prism of the
Modern's gigantic collections, ``MoMA2000'' is supposed to prepare
museum-goers for expanded thinking about art, to go along with the
museum's expanded real estate, a vast addition being designed by
Yoshio Taniguchi and scheduled for completion in 2004.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, ``ModernStarts'' examines the idea of ``modernism,''
but discards the strict linear canon MoMA had always espoused,
instead cavorting freely among styles, media, and categories. It
works. The curators _ John Elderfield, Peter Reed, Mary Chan, and
Maria Carmen Gonzalez _ have the finest eyes in the business for
what looks good next to what, what objects spark each other.
They've focused on art from around 1880-1920, but were none too
fussy about the dates: They added earlier and later works when
appropriate, and monumental contemporary ones to introduce the
show's themes.
 &HT;    ``People,'' for instance, opens with a vast 1975 Sol LeWitt wall
drawing of white arcs on a black wall. Abstract, yes, but the
context encourages you to read the composition as a ballet reduced
to its essence, even as the ultimate distillation of one of the
masterworks in the galleries beyond, Matisse's 1909 ``Dance.''
Another abstraction, a red stripe painting by Barnett Newman, acts
as backdrop for Maillol's gargantuan allegorical female figure,
``The River,'' which tumbles forward into space like a waterfall.
Both are heroic; the Newman stresses the verticality of the
masculine; the Maillol, the horizontality of the feminine. Not
particularly PC, this contrast, but it's clear.
 &HT;    France looms large in ``People'' and its companion shows,
largest in ``Places,'' where, in certain galleries, French
landscape almost blots out any other country's contributions. MoMA
championed the School of Paris from the start. While the museum has
broadened its outlook, Paris is still an overwhelming presence,
with Rodin, Matisse, and Picasso among the heavyweights of the
``People'' section. The themes here reach beyond what you'd expect
_ the move toward the fragmentation and abstraction of the figure _
to include ideas like posture as composition, using, as example,
the way Matisse's blocky bronze ``Backs'' virtually merge with
their slablike backgrounds.
 &HT;    A room exploring the body language of despair juxtaposes
Steichen's ``Pussy Willow'' photograph with Schiele's ``Nude with
Violet Stockings'': In both, the figure's face is obscured, which
makes the crouched-over posture all the more prominent. The
curators highlight artists who exploited the figure to make
compositions that were daring for their day, like the Degas pastel
``At The Milliner's,'' a picture that zooms from left to right and
doesn't include the viewer at all. The milliner is intent on the
client; the client, on her image in a mirror we're not privy to
see.
 &HT;    A section on actors, dancers, and bathers _ people who exist to
be looked at _ juxtaposes a 1921 Steichen photograph, ``Wind, Fire,
Therese Duncan'' _ with Jules Cheret's 1893 poster
``Folies-Bergere, La Loie Fuller.'' In each, the dancer is consumed
by a costume that seems almost to go up in flames. (Fuller
experimented with radium to light herself up.) The amorphous nature
of the image symbolizes the freedom of the modern dance that
developed at the turn of the century.
 &HT;    One of the most telling juxtapositions of ``People'' is a c.
1885 Cezanne ``Bather'' next to Rineke Dukstra's 1993 Chromogenic
<TEXT>
color print, ``Odessa, Ukraine. 4 August 1993.'' Both depict a lone
male figure in swim trunks, silhouetted against a low horizon line.
The heroic bulk of the Cezanne suggests timelessness, eternity;
Dukstra's boy, by contrast, looks frail and very much of the
moment.

   Maria Fernanda Cardoso's stunning 1992 ``Cementerio _ Vertical
Garden,'' a 112-foot-wide expanse of artificial flowers that spring
directly from the wall, parallel to the floor, opens ``Places'' in
suitably disorienting fashion. The massive bunches of fake white
lilies suggest a cemetery, an interpretation reinforced by faint
pencilled arches on the wall behind them: They look like rows of
tombstones. The topsy-turvy effect of Cardoso's piece jibes with
the entrance to the galleries, one of Hector Guimard's famous
turn-of-the-century Paris Metro gates, iron liquified into whiplash
curves, jack-in-the-pulpit lighting fixtures and irregular
typography. Like Cardoso's artificial flowers, Guimard's garden of
a gate is an example of modern means and materials mimicking
nature.
</P>
<P>
   Examples of artists' rejection of modern industrialization
follows in the very next room, though. The ambiguity about
``progress'' is epitomized in the rugged woodcuts Gauguin made
after fleeing to Tahiti and Munch's depictions of lonely souls
staring out at a black sea or dense pine forest. Photographs of a
train careening around a cliff, the building of the Panama Canal,
the Eiffel Tower going up, document nature disturbed.
</P>
<P>
   The airplane freed man from earth and freed artists from the
traditional horizon line. In World War I, RAF pilots on
reconnaissance missions were taught to identify landscapes as
``Cubist'' or ``Futurist.'' Aerial views have much in common with
the disconnect of modern painting. In the MoMA show, Malevich's
1915 ``Suprematist Composition: Airplane Flying,'' which at first
glance looks completely non-representational, is paired with
Jacques-Henri Lartigue's 1909 photograph of a glider, to emphasize
that the Malevich isn't abstract at all.
</P>
<P>
   The hyperactivity of Futurism butts up against the eerie
stillness of Surrealism in a section devoted to views of an urban
Europe shattered by the Great War. Matisse's ``View of Notre Dame''
hangs next to Mondrian's ``Church Facade'': In both, the church
towers are barely legible, surrounded and defined by networks of
black lines, a break-up of space that has nothing to do with the
horizon line of open land. A map of Paris locates the studios of
the astonishing number of important artists working there early in
the century. The proximity of their workplaces belies the notion of
the artist working in isolation _ and confirms what MoMA has
preached all along about Parisian preeminence of the period.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   ``Things'' is the most fun of all three parts of
``ModernStarts,'' and here the curators had the most leeway. While
they couldn't include real people or places in the other sections,
they could and did incorporate real chairs, tables, and toast racks
in this one, along with painted representations of same. A witty
lineup of still-life paintings by Klee, Gauguin, Matisse, and Miro
illustrates the 20th century willingness to ignore gravity and
perspective and tilt the tabletop until it's parallel to the
picture plane, the better to show what's on the table. A few real
tables from the same era, including an oval one by Charles Rennie
Mackintosh, keep you grounded.
</P>
<P>
   In a section on guitars the curators had a field day with this
curvaceous instrument that resembles the female form and symbolizes
the Bohemian life as well. For Picasso and Gris, the guitar also
evoked their native Spain. Guitars depicted in works in the MoMA
show have been dismantled and reassembled, in two dimensions and
three. Artists experimented with how little of a guitar they could
show and still have it be unmistakable. Picasso's 1912-13 sheet
metal and wire ``Guitar,'' for instance, is crudely cut, ragged and
unplayable, but resolute in its identity.
</P>
<P>
   A case devoted to objects as subjects holds things that look
like other things, including Tiffany glass and Grueby faience, both
plantlike, and a Christopher Dresser watering can so sleek it looks
like abstract sculpture. There are function-thwarted objects
including Man Ray's ``Cadeau,'' a flatiron spiked with 13 tacks
that would snag any fabric the iron encountered; and Meret
Oppenheim's iconic fur-covered teacup. And there's Umberto
Boccioni's even more iconic ``Development of a Bottle in Space,'' a
fractured, twirling bronze that looks as if it's spun right out of
a still-life painting of the period in its determination to become
3-D.
</P>
<P>
   Trans-Atlantic affinities emerge. Frank Lloyd Wright's strict
but colorful geometry is teamed with Mondrian's; Gaudi's ability to
make iron look fluid and organic is likened to Louis Sullivan's. It
took the Gothic style centuries to spread across Europe; it took
Art Nouveau no time at all to cover two continents. Technology is
as much a determinant in ``Things'' as advances in communication.
The perfection of bentwood in the 19th century, for instance, made
possible chairs that spiralled and curled.
</P>
<P>
   Big, brash, c. 1910 posters by Lucian Bernhard and others
advertise cigarettes, lightbulbs, and toothpaste by placing single
examples against vividly colored grounds. They anticipate Pop by
half a century. A section on the word as object demonstrates how
words were incorporated into Cubist and Dada pictures, and how
typography was freed from neat horizontal rows and uniform scale.
The basis for Jenny Holzer's blinking truisms of the late 1970s was
in place decades earlier. What's most eye-opening and eye-popping
about ``Things'' is how much of modern art was fully present by
1920.

 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Get itchy when you think about all that unread
e-mail piling up back at the office? Do you lie awake nights
wondering about how many recruiters have left you digital siren
songs? Can't wait to open all those hilarious forwarded e-mail
jokes?
</P>
<P>
   You ship has just pulled in.
</P>
<P>
   Electronics giant Motorola and Research in Motion, a New
York-based wireless data company, are pushing two nifty, but
imperfect, devices that will let e-mail addicts get their fix just
about anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Both devices _ Motorola's PageWriter 2000X and RIM's Blackberry
_ are pager-like devices with tiny keyboards that send and receive
e-mail messages via radio signal. They also include some simple but
useful software that keeps track of a user's calendar, phone
messages, memos and other personal information.
</P>
<P>
   For someone who has to keep up with e-mail, these are viable
solutions. But with the advent of other wireless technologies, such
as the connected personal digital assistants like the Palm VII and
the increasing e-mail capabilities of cell phones, the pager e-mail
devices seem to be headed for a niche market. And it's too bad,
because both the PageWriter and the Blackberry are, for lack of a
better word, pretty nifty.
</P>
<P>
   The Blackberry resembles a pager with a slight weight problem.
It sports a tiny keyboard that, at first, seems daunting, but
actually is quite functional. You can't write a novel on this
thing, but for a simple e-mail response, it works just fine. The
device fits in a cradle that attaches to a PC's serial port. It can
trade phone numbers and other data with such popular personal
information managers as Outlook and ACT.
</P>
<P>
   As a stand-alone organizer, the Blackberry actually rivals the
Palm and other electronic gizmos for ease of use. A scroll button
on the upper right lets you easily navigate through the various
functions and up and down lists. And the keyboard is actually more
accurate and faster than the scribble input of a Pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Setting up the Blackberry is a bit daunting. You have to first
determine whether your PC is using Microsoft Exchange Server
software. Most do, but some don't, and you should be careful to
check this out before you invest in a Blackberry. After installing
the software, you then have to leave your PC on in order to get
your messages shunted to the Blackberry.
</P>
<P>
   But once you go through all that, you will find that the
Blackberry makes a great companion. It notifies you via a tone or
vibration of arriving messages. You can shut the device off while
in a theater or on an airplane, and the service will send along
e-mails that have piled up while you were off the air.
</P>
<P>
   But not all e-mail can be forwarded. You can't send attachments,
and the Blackberry device is not designed to deal with lengthy
messages. Users can set up filters to send only messages with
specific subjects or read messages only from particular people.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola's slightly beefier PageWriter 2000X could be considered
the deluxe version of the Blackberry. The screen is brighter and
larger; navigation is through an easy-to-use four-direction
``NavDisc.'' The keyboard, slightly larger than the Blackberry,
lights up. And instead of a replaceable AA battery, the PageWriter
sports a rechargeable power pack that fuels up from a desktop
cradle. Like the Blackberry, the PageWriter includes all the usual
personal information organizing software, and it will synch with
the usual desktop PC organizing titles.
</P>
<P>
   The Motorola requires you to have a separate e-mail account that
uses a pretty arcane naming scheme. You also have to add separate
software to your company's servers to forward e-mail to the
PageWriter.

   Stretching before you exercise in a bid to prevent injuries is a
waste of time. So say Australian researchers who have advised the
country's army to consign the tradition to the scrap heap.
</P>
<P>
   Army physiotherapist Rod Pope, working with colleagues at the
University of Sydney and Charles Sturt University in Wagga Wagga,
has monitored more than 2,600 army recruits over a year in
randomized, controlled trials. Some of the recruits stretched
particular leg muscles before exercise. Others did not. Yet, there
were no differences in injury rates between the two groups _ and
not just because too few recruits in either group became injured to
register a significant effect. ``We were able to rule out even a
quite small effect of stretching,'' Pope says.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has not been properly researched before,'' he explains.
``Stretching was assumed to work in preventing injury, but there
was no evidence to suggest it did.''
</P>
<P>
   The work has been accepted for publication by Medicine and
Science in Sports and Exercise, the journal of the American College
of Sports Medicine. ``We are telling the army to no longer
stretch,'' Pope says. ``But it's a long tradition and tradition
dies hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite this advice, Pope stresses that it is important to
stretch muscles which are tight and could restrict the normal range
of movement. He also suspects that stretching after exercise could
be beneficial _ although this has not been fully investigated.
``There is no evidence that points unequivocally one way or the
other,'' says Robert Price of Deakin University in Melbourne. &QL;

register a significant effect. ``We were able to rule out even a
quite small effect of stretching,'' Pope says.

<P>
   ``This has not been properly researched before,'' he explains.
``Stretching was assumed to work in preventing injury, but there
was no evidence to suggest it did.''
</P>
<P>
   The work has been accepted for publication by Medicine and
Science in Sports and Exercise, the journal of the American College
of Sports Medicine. ``We are telling the army to no longer
stretch,'' Pope says. ``But it's a long tradition and tradition
dies hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite this advice, Pope stresses that it is important to
stretch muscles which are tight and could restrict the normal range
of movement. He also suspects that stretching after exercise could
be beneficial _ although this has not been fully investigated.
``There is no evidence that points unequivocally one way or the
other,'' says Robert Price of Deakin University in Melbourne. &QL;

   Stretching before you exercise in a bid to prevent injuries is a
waste of time. So say Australian researchers who have advised the
country's army to consign the tradition to the scrap heap.
</P>
<P>
   Army physiotherapist Rod Pope, working with colleagues at the
University of Sydney and Charles Sturt University in Wagga Wagga,
has monitored more than 2,600 army recruits over a year in
randomized, controlled trials. Some of the recruits stretched
particular leg muscles before exercise. Others did not. Yet, there
were no differences in injury rates between the two groups _ and
not just because too few recruits in either group became injured to
register a significant effect. ``We were able to rule out even a
quite small effect of stretching,'' Pope says.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has not been properly researched before,'' he explains.
``Stretching was assumed to work in preventing injury, but there
was no evidence to suggest it did.''
</P>
<P>
   The work has been accepted for publication by Medicine and

   Making tumor cells look like microscopic comets could save
people with bladder cancer from the trauma of unnecessary surgery
or radiotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Some bladder cancers are superficial and can be removed by
scraping the suspect cells of the bladder lining. But nearly a
third grow into the muscle wall that surrounds the bladder. This
necessitates more severe treatments such as surgery, which involves
the removal of part or all of the bladder, or radiotherapy which
typically lasts six weeks. Choice of treatment depends largely on
the location of the tumor and the risks of surgery vs.
radiotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   But half the patients sent for radiotherapy do not respond to
the treatment because their tumors resist radiation _ allowing them
to grow or shed cells that cause secondary tumors to grow elsewhere
in the body.
</P>
<P>
   Now, researchers in Ulster and Leicester believe a quick test
for a bladder tumor's resistance to radiation could help them
decide which is the best therapy. They start by breaking down a
sample of the tumor into single cells. These cells are set in a gel
called agarose and bombarded with X-rays, equivalent to the dose a
patient would receive during radiotherapy. The scientists then
treat the cells with detergents to break up the cell membranes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you then apply an electric field across the gel, the broken
DNA migrates out of the cells and tails out like a comet,'' says
George Jones of the University of Leicester. The way the negatively
charged DNA breaks up shows that radiation is killing the tumor.
``The more damage you have done to the DNA, the more you get in the
tail.'' They have dubbed their test a ``comet assay.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones and his colleagues in Leicester will begin collecting
tumor samples in January. These will then be sent to Valerie
McKelvey-Martin at the University of Ulster at Coleraine for
testing. If the tests are successful, the assay could be used to
assess the radiosensitivity of tumors elsewhere in the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is potentially a very interesting technique,'' says
Adrian Harris of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund in Oxford. But
he warns that the test might not give the full picture. ``The comet
assay may pick up radiotherapy resistance due to DNA repair, but
would miss radiotherapy resistance caused by lack of oxygen,'' he
says. &QL;

   Japanese patents often pass unnoticed because of the language
barrier. So an inventor in Sweden who spent nearly nine years
steering his patent for a see-through refrigerator past the
Japanese Patent Office (JP2032200) is celebrating with a
translation on the Internet (http://reorient.com/coolview/).

   Bruce Lambert's fridge has a two-way mirror for a door. When the
inside is dark, it acts as an ordinary mirror that, according to
Lambert, increases the feeling of space in the kitchen and
``encourages dieting.'' When the light inside the fridge is
switched on, the door becomes transparent, letting you see the
contents without wasting cooling power. &QL;

MAN OF THE CENTURY: JOHN ROCK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, December 19, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You could spend every waking hour between Christmas and New
Year's in family conclaves debating who did the most good in the
century just ending.
</P>
<P>
   Start by striking out all the despots _ the Hitlers, Lenins,
Stalins, and Maos. But spend five minutes kicking the topic around
after the Christmas bird is plucked clean, and there'll be a raft
of interesting or daffy nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's nominee is Franklin D. Roosevelt, the president
who kept spirits up during the Great Depression and the worst war
the world has seen. Winston Churchill, the Greatest Briton, is
another, though I think that even had he not emerged, or had fallen
prey at 25 to a Boer bullet on one of his hell-for-leather gallops
across the veldt, somehow Britan would have prevailed over Nazi
Germany and the Axis.
</P>
<P>
   Ghandi? Martin Luther King Jr.? JFK? Mother Teresa? Thomas
Edison? Henry Ford? The scientists who gave us polio vaccine,
penicillin, television, computers? A musically inclined friend
swears by John Lennon. An artist tells me Picasso. Your own
short-list might be totally different.
</P>
<P>
   Without pre-empting Time magazine, which seems to have a
stranglehold on the concept, my nominee for Man of the Century is a
tall (6 foot one-and-a-half), slim, pipe-smoking gent of quiet and
courtly manner, Massachusetts born and bred, as it happens, a
Bostonian to the core, who at his death in 1984 had done more good
for more people, by my rough calculation, than anyone I can name.
</P>
<P>
   His name? Dr. John Rock.
</P>
<P>
   He did not invent, but he did help develop, popularize, improve,
expand, and defend the birth control pill. Using natural hormones
in a timely fashion, the pill brought into common usage by Rock and
his many collaborators and colleagues changed life in remarkable
ways, not only for females of child-bearing age, but for the men
who cared for them, or tried to keep them down. Despite the
opposition of Roman Catholic prelates, women around the world,
including over 80 percent of Catholic women, embraced the pill as a
godsend, if not a pope-send.
</P>
<P>
   Women work today, outside the home, in numbers not dreamed of
when Rock took himself to Harvard College and Harvard Medical
School. Only 40 years before Rock was born in 1890, half of all
American women were illiterate. Twenty years before his birth, six
out of 10 working women were domestic servants. When he turned 10,
women held three out of four clerical jobs in the United States,
thanks to the invention of the typewriter. At the turn of this
century, only 4 percent of married white women worked outside the
home.
</P>
<P>
   Each time there was a war, women's rights took a lurch forward.
During World War I, most women cooked, cleaned, or washed, in a
work week that typically extended to 72 hours. But by World War II,
one shipyard worker out of eight was female, and an astonishing 40
percent of aircraft assembly workers were women. But the war did
not change as much as did that little pill. Life expectancy for
American women was 51 in 1900, and it is 80 today.
</P>
<P>
   The pill helped prolong women's lives by giving them better-paid
and physically easier work, and reducing the strain imposed by
successive childbirths. Nothing has done as much to reduce the
dependence of women upon men as the pill that freed them from
unwanted pregnancy. And it is worth remarking that the man who did
most to advance the pill's acceptance was a happily married father
of five, a descendant of Irish famine immigrants, who presided over
his merry brood in a French manor-style home in West Roxbury,
spending his working life trying to help Boston women have babies
when they wanted them.
</P>
<P>
   He had a first-rate high school education at Boston's High
School of Commerce. Musically inclined and theatrical, very close
to his twin sister, Nell, he was a devout Catholic who grew up in a
happy household with loving parents. ``They got along beautifully
together,'' he said of his parents.
</P>
<P>
   But he discovered firsthand the negative impact on family life
of unwanted pregnancies when he won an essay contest in high
school, and the prize was a trip to Latin America. As a payroll
clerk for United Fruit, he saw the destitution and dismay of the
impossibly large families of the peasants who picked bananas. As a
doctor in Boston, he saw how the poorer women were kept in grinding
poverty by relentless childbearing.
</P>
<P>
   Rock's remarkable life is detailed in the 1982 biography ``The
Pill, John Rock and the Church'' by Loretta McLaughlin, my retired
Globe colleague. When he died two years later, she wrote in a Globe
editorial that Rock paid a severe personal price for his battle
against misplaced prudery. Yet it was ``with dignity and a feeling
for humanity'' that he managed to nudge medicine toward a more
enlightened attitude toward human reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   The year John Rock was born, the world's population stood at 1.5
billion. Today, it is 6 billion, and one person out of five lives
on the equivalent of less than a dollar a day. But there might have
been many millions more clinging to the shrinking surface of
Lifeboat Earth had not Rock's little pill come into popular use.
</P>
<P>
   After writing his own book, ``The Time Has Come; a Catholic
Doctor's Proposals to End the Battle Over Birth Control,'' Rock
traveled the globe, warning that unrestrained population growth
threatened the welfare of humanity by pitching mankind into
life-or-death struggles for food, water, and cropland. His faith,
like his name, was unshakable. He recognized, like Freud, the
centrality of sexual congress in maintaining a marriage.
</P>
<P>
   He made it possible for women to have a life, as well as a sex
life, and in doing so, made life so much richer and more rewarding
for their menfolk as well. So, I ask you: who did more, for more
people, this century, than this man Rock?

LATEX IS THE `STATE OF THE ART' FOR INTERIOR WALLS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, December 19, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am having all my interior walls painted. Is it best to use
oil or latex?
</P>
<P>
   CAROL GOLDMAN, Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The state of the art is to apply two coats of latex or
acrylic, or latex-acrylic, (water-based) wall paint, flat or
eggshell, which is neither flat nor shiny. And, it is best to do
this. Generally no primer is needed on plaster, plasterboard, or
skimcoat walls, but it is a good idea to sand the walls lightly and
to wash really dirty walls. Otherwise they need a wiping down with
a dry cloth to remove dust and surface dirt.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I put away my crystal salt and pepper shakers last Christmas
and did not remove the salt and pepper. When I got them out this
season, the pepper was not a problem. It cleaned out nicely. But
between the tarnish and salt I cannot get the sterling silver top
off the salt shaker. I shook the salt out but the top is still
stuck on. I soaked it in hot water to no avail. Can you offer any
help?
</P>
<P>
   MARY ELLEN McLAUGHLIN, in Cyberspace
</P>
<P>
   A. Let's try. Salt is soluble in water, so it's a matter of
getting the water into the space between cover and glass. Soak the
shaker in water overnight or longer. Then try twisting off the cap.
First, tap it with the flat side of a knife to possibly break the
bond. To get a better grip, use a thin rubber pad designed for that
purpose. Another twister-offer is a small tool, I think it's called
a Gilhooley, but I couldn't find it in the dictionary. They give a
very good grip without damaging the cap, although you want to grasp
the cap where it grips the glass, not above it. If that fails, soak
it some more in water. No additives needed. Finally, if all else
fails, try squirting a bit of WD-40 into the space (space? very
little space) between cap and glass. Something's gotta give!
</P>
<P>
   In the future, use the shaker and pepperer all year long.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My split-entry house was built in the 1960s. The bedrooms are
over a two-car garage, and they are cold. If I put in new garage
doors that have no windows and are insulated, will it solve the
problem?
</P>
<P>
   TOM FOLAN, from Out There
</P>
<P>
   A. Insulated doors on your garage will make no difference in
keeping the bedrooms warmer. Don't waste your money. In a '60s
house, the garage ceiling is probably insulated, but you can check
to see if it is. Drill a hole in the ceiling to check. It is
probably a cement-type concrete on wire lath to make it fire
resistant. Or, check the ceiling space between garage and basement.
If there is any insulation in there, it should be full; that is,
the entire ceiling cavity should be full. If there is none, you can
have cellulose blown in. If there is plenty of insulation, then
your heating system is slightly undersized and is not getting to
the far bedrooms, which are probably the farthest away from the
boiler. You can try insulating any heating pipes that you can see
in the garage or basement. This will keep the water hot until it
reaches the baseboard heaters.
</P>
<P>
   Or, live with the cool bedrooms; they should be cool, especially
for sleeping. Kids can handle the cool; tell them to put another
sweater on. A last resort is to upgrade the heating system to a
bigger one.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do you recommend for hot water radiators? Is it
necessary to paint with a high-heat-resistant (hhr) paint? Is an
enclosure or cover OK?
</P>
<P>
   PETER LYME, Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The best paint is an oil-based primer and oil-based spray
enamel. Apply the primer with a brush, but for the finish, use an
aerosol can of enamel; Krylon makes a good spray enamel; expensive
but very serviceable. The darker the color, the better the heat
transfer. Do not use the old-fashioned silver or bronze paint; it
reduces the efficiency of the radiators by about 10 percent. There
is no need for an hrr paint; hot water radiators do not get that
hot. But they do get hot enough to turn latex paint brown; that is
why uou should use oil paints. An enclosure or cover will make the
radiator more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Red candle wax dripped on a newly-finished floor. I took off
the wax with a credit card, but how can I remove the red dye that
remains? Goof-Off did not work.
</P>
<P>
   HELENE DUNLAP, Chestnut Hill, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. That red dye is probably still a bit of wax, so try this:
Place brown paper (a grocery bag, cut to one layer, will do nicely)
on the stain and run a warm to hot iron over it. You will see the
paper discolor; move the paper and repeat.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't work, it may be that it is only the dye, and it
is on the very top of the finish. So, spread a bit of toothpaste
(not gel) on the stain and rub with your fingers, with the grain.
Or, wet the stain with any kind of oil, sprinkle a bit of
rottenstone (sold in paint and hardware stores) on the oil, then
rub. There is enough abrasive material in the toothpaste (Colgate
is best for this purpose) and the rottenstone to take off the very
top of the finish.

&HT;     ROBBERY SUSPECTS MAKE POLICE WORK EASY 
</HEADLINE>
 DUMB-SUSPECTS-HNS   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The police are calling these robbery suspects
dumb, dumber and dumbest.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys sure made our work easier,'' said Lt. Bruce
Marovich, head of the San Francisco police robbery detail. ``These
guys don't think. They just do it _ impulse and go. I don't know if
they have half a brain between them.''
</P>
<P>
   Marovich was referring to the seven suspects in more than 60
robberies and holdups in San Francisco in the past month. The
crimes they are suspected of committing include bank robberies,
store stickups, street muggings and assaults.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the police said, a suspect was arrested after his
accomplice blurted out his name during a robbery of his former
workplace. A second suspect in that case turned himself in after an
investigator used the oldest line in law enforcement: ``We know
everything, you might as well confess.''
</P>
<P>
   In another case, the suspects were arrested after they used
cellular phones the police said they had stolen to call their
girlfriends. Finally, a robber caught Wednesday had the wit to hail
a cab in broad daylight outside the bank he had just robbed.
</P>
<P>
   The first case involved a guy who is accused of robbing his
former employer, a video arcade at Pier 39. The police said Audie
Branagan, 26, tried to rob the Namco Land video arcade on Nov. 21
with another man. Both men wore ski masks. The police said Branagan
tried to conceal his voice so his co-workers would not recognize
him. But his accomplice messed up, Marovich said, and blurted,
``Audie'' during the crime. The robbers then allegedly tried to
strangle the manager because she was a witness. She feigned
unconsciousness, and the robbers fled with the loot, officers said.
</P>
<P>
   It took officers 10 days to find Branagan, who was arrested Dec.
1 when his car ran out of gas after leading the California Highway
Patrol on a high-speed chase.
</P>
<P>
   Branagan told investigators that he only knew that his
accomplice's name was ``Bryan,'' police Inspector Dan Gardner said.
Gardner tried a pager number he found on Branagan's cellular phone.
A man promptly returned the call, reaching Gardner at the Hall of
Justice, Marovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner told him, ``We know all about you, Bryan. You better
turn yourself in.'' The caller quickly hung up. But a minute later
Branagan's cellular phone rang and Gardner answered. Without
realizing that he was talking to the police inspector, the caller
said, ``Audie, the cops know everything. What should we do?''
according to Marovich
</P>
<P>
   Gardner replied: ``I'm the police officer you just spoke to. We
know everything. It would better for you if you just came on in
here on your own.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, 18-year-old Bryan Houston of San Francisco
walked into the Hall of Justice and turned himself in for the Pier
39 robbery, Marovich said. Prior to that, the police had no idea
about his identity and no proof he committed the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like playing poker,'' said Marovich, between hearty
laughs. ``You tell everyone you've got a full house when you really
have a pair of deuces.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days before the arrests of Houston and Branagan, officers
arrested the so-called ``Give It Up'' bandits. Because both
suspects were 17 at the time of the crimes were committed, the
police did not identify the suspects.
</P>
<P>
   They are suspected of 20 muggings in on four different nights in
November. One would wait behind the wheel of a pickup truck while
the other would do the mugging, the police said. Marovich said the
mugger pistol-whipped some of his victims before demanding money.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would just hear footsteps and, bam, this guy would hit
the victim and knock them down,'' Marovich said. ``He beat up
people, especially males, when he didn't have to.''
</P>
<P>
   The break came, police said, when the two teens took a cellular
phone that they promptly used to call their respective girlfriends
and other buddies, Marovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors Robert Totah and Bob McMillan traced the calls over
the Thanksgiving weekend and arrested the pair when they returned
to the city from visiting relatives for the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on Wednesday officers arrested a man they believe is a
bank robber dubbed the ``Blonde Bandit.'' Blaine Lippincott, 29,
was taken into custody about 10 minutes after he allegedly passed a
note demanding money to a bank teller at a Washington Mutual bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``He walked outside and got in a cab,'' Marovich said. ``The
teller watched him and got the taxi number: Yellow cab number 999.
Pretty easy for us.''

 &HT;    TRADE ACCORDS LOST IN FEDERAL BUREAUCRACY
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At a time when exports have been a key factor in
the U.S. economy and a central theme of the Clinton administration,
the government is having trouble keeping track of its trade
agreements with other nations.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. General Accounting Office, after searching federal
archives, concluded that the records were so incomplete that it
could not tell how many trade pacts the United States now has.
</P>
<P>
   The poor record-keeping hinders the enforcement of the accords,
the GAO warned in a report released this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fully securing the benefits of trade liberalization depends,
in part, on the ability of both private businesses and the public
to quickly and easily access the terms and conditions of the
numerous trade agreements,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that in some cases Congress is not notified of
agreements, as required by law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lack of information on the terms and conditions of these
agreements could impede Congress' oversight efforts to determine
whether trade agreements are being fully implemented,'' the GAO
said.
</P>
<P>
   Trade agreements are the chief means for opening markets and
reducing tariffs for U.S. goods and services abroad. The job of
negotiating them is divided among several federal agencies,
including the U.S. Trade Representative's office and the State and
Commerce departments, each of which keeps its own listing.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, identified 441 trade
accords between 1984 and 1998. But the study added that the actual
total was ``uncertain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Officials at key agencies were unable to provide a definitive
count,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it said some of the information made public about the
pacts has included ``factual errors.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a draft of the report, the Commerce Department
late last month announced it had begun a periodic review of its
database to add missing agreements and remove obsolete ones.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the House Ways and Means Committee, Greg Crist,
said Friday that the GAO findings ``should serve as a wake-up call,
as we move into next year, to have a detailed account of these
negotiations'' for overseeing trade issues. But he added that the
poor record-keeping was not seen as a cause for major concern by
the committee, which asked for the GAO study.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. exports, which have increased about 70 percent to almost
$700 billion a year since 1990, have been a driving force in the
current economy. However, imports are rising even faster, leading
to a record trade deficit of $25.9 billion for the United States
last month.

 &HT;    TRADE ACCORDS LOST IN FEDERAL BUREAUCRACY
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At a time when exports have been a key factor in
the U.S. economy and a central theme of the Clinton administration,
the government is having trouble keeping track of its trade
agreements with other nations.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. General Accounting Office, after searching federal
archives, concluded that the records were so incomplete that it
could not tell how many trade pacts the United States now has.
</P>
<P>
   The poor record-keeping hinders the enforcement of the accords,
the GAO warned in a report released this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fully securing the benefits of trade liberalization depends,
in part, on the ability of both private businesses and the public
to quickly and easily access the terms and conditions of the
numerous trade agreements,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that in some cases Congress is not notified of
agreements, as required by law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lack of information on the terms and conditions of these
agreements could impede Congress' oversight efforts to determine
whether trade agreements are being fully implemented,'' the GAO
said.
</P>
<P>
   Trade agreements are the chief means for opening markets and
reducing tariffs for U.S. goods and services abroad. The job of
negotiating them is divided among several federal agencies,
including the U.S. Trade Representative's office and the State and
Commerce departments, each of which keeps its own listing.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, identified 441 trade
accords between 1984 and 1998. But the study added that the actual
total was ``uncertain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Officials at key agencies were unable to provide a definitive
count,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it said some of the information made public about the
pacts has included ``factual errors.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a draft of the report, the Commerce Department
late last month announced it had begun a periodic review of its
database to add missing agreements and remove obsolete ones.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the House Ways and Means Committee, Greg Crist,
said Friday that the GAO findings ``should serve as a wake-up call,
as we move into next year, to have a detailed account of these
negotiations'' for overseeing trade issues. But he added that the
poor record-keeping was not seen as a cause for major concern by
the committee, which asked for the GAO study.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. exports, which have increased about 70 percent to almost
$700 billion a year since 1990, have been a driving force in the
current economy. However, imports are rising even faster, leading
to a record trade deficit of $25.9 billion for the United States
last month.

ALL-STAR CAST REMEMBERS MARLEY IN TNT TRIBUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All-star tributes are often awkward affairs, filled with erratic
performances and cocky stars trying to get their faces on TV
because their managers thought it was a good idea. Do they love the
artist being paid tribute? That doesn't always matter, as long as
there's a potential for ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, such is not the case with TNT's ``One Love: Bob
Marley All-Star Tribute,'' a moving tribute in which a high-end
cast of talent _ Lauryn Hill, Tracy Chapman, Jimmy Cliff, Queen
Latifah, Erykah Badu, and others _ recognizes the soul of Marley's
landmark reggae and conveys that passion to the viewer.
</P>
<P>
   In short, no dilettantes allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Not that all the performances on Sunday's two-hour Marley
tribute (airing on TNT at 8 p.m.) are keepers. There are a few
flops, such as Chrissie Hynde's way-too-understated version of
``Waiting in Vain.''
</P>
<P>
   But most stars who ventured to an outdoor stage in Jamaica's
Oracabessa Bay for the taping two weeks ago provide exquisite
versions of Marley's still-relevant blend of social protest tunes,
tender love songs, and spiritual anthems.
</P>
<P>
   On a stage flanked by photos of Marley (who died of cancer in
1981), the stars display their reverence, but also their
interpretative skills, while backed by remnants of Marley's band,
the Wailers, and backup singers, the I-Threes (including his widow,
Rita). Rain starts to fall on the audience, but doesn't dampen
spirits onstage.
</P>
<P>
   Grammy queen Lauryn Hill intones a stirring ``Turn Your Lights
Down Low,'' as husband Rohan Marley (one of Bob's seven children)
spins around her at the end. Reggae pioneer Cliff fixates with
party favorite ``Jammin' '' before Badu brilliantly jazzifies ``No
More Trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The best efforts, though, come from Chapman and Queen Latifah.
The former drops her vaunted shyness and energizes ``Three Little
Birds'' (with its famed ``don't worry about a thing'' chorus), and
Latifah stomps around in bare feet, singing rivetingly about the
``hypocrites and parasites'' in Marley's ``Who the Cap Fits.'' If
there's one lesson from this tribute, it's that Chapman and Latifah
should do a reggae album _ or, better yet, do one together.
</P>
<P>
   Other affecting performances come from Ben Harper (``Get Up,
Stand Up''), Chris Robinson of the Black Crowes (``Kinky Reggae''),
Darius Rucker of Hootie and the Blowfish (an admirable ``War,''
with the great line, ``until the color of a man's skin is of no
more significance than the color of his eyes, then I've got to say
`war' ''), and reggae great Toots Hibbert (``Lively up Yourself'').
</P>
<P>
   The night ends with Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers firing
through ``Could You Be Loved,'' followed by an ensemble finale of
``One Love.'' No wonder there will also be a concert album and home
video released next year.

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LEWIS, Wash. _ When Army Dr. Stephen Whitlock Smith took
over the emergency room at the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in
Germany six years ago, he found a facility in deep crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military hospital's emergency room was suffering from
acute staff shortages, aging equipment and inadequate supplies _ so
much so that Smith feared for the safety of patients and medical
staff alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the scariest professional experience that any of us had
ever thought we'd be involved in,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and his emergency room staff pleaded for more physicians
and supplies. Personnel were working up to 60 hours a week for
prolonged periods. At one point, a psychiatric nurse was assigned
to the ER to monitor symptoms of suicidal behavior among staff
members as a result of work-related stresses.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of fruitless requests, Smith took a harder
approach: He filed an official complaint against his Army superiors
for failing to correct the problems.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Smith saw immediate results.
</P>
<P>
   He was fired as head of the emergency room. The hospital
commander revoked his medical credentials. Smith was shipped 7,000
miles from his family to Madigan Army Medical Center at Fort Lewis,
Wash., where he was held in a psychiatric ward for three weeks
without a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Today, three years later, the 54-year-old lieutenant colonel
remains at Fort Lewis, still engaged in guerrilla warfare with the
brass, still working in the uncertain twilight of a military
medical career gone sour. And still, he says, suffering illegal
reprisals for his whistle-blowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was done intentionally to muffle me, destroy my career
and family,'' said Smith, a soft-spoken but intense man. ``I think
they are trying to wear me out and they don't care if my family is
destroyed in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   He is more than $30,000 in debt from lawyers' bills. For the
past two months, he has been living in a tent at a Fort Lewis
recreational campsite.
</P>
<P>
   What Smith wants now is vindication, the opportunity to retire
early from the Army, and to get a civilian medical license in
Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials won't talk about Smith's accusations, citing the
privileged nature of most of the material involved, including
Smith's own medical records.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation into Smith's original complaint filed with the
inspector general at Landstuhl and a review of working conditions
at Landstuhl by the Army's European Medical Command found no
evidence to support his allegations, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentagon acknowledges that the Defense Department is
investigating allegations of mismanagement at Landstuhl, as well as
Smith's complaints of reprisals from officials there and at
Madigan.
</P>
<P>
   Smith remains optimistic that the investigation will clear his
name and reputation. He sees his battle as a war of attrition, and
so far, Smith says, ``I have survived.''
</P>
<P>
   An Emergency Room in Crisis
</P>
<P>
   Smith reported to the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center as chief
of emergency medical services in July 1993. It was his third stint
as the head of an ER facility. He had the same job at a civilian
hospital in Rhode Island, then was ER chief at an Army hospital in
Denver before the transfer to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and his family were excited about moving to Landstuhl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We enjoyed it for the day trips and weekend tours,'' Smith
recalled. ``It's the very best part of Europe to go touring from
because everything is so close, whether France or the Bavarian Alps
or the rest of Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   But work quickly began to crowd out family life, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The medical facility in southwest Germany is the trauma center
for all U.S. military forces in Europe, including troops deployed
to crisis areas such as Somalia, Bosnia and Kosovo. It is open 24
hours a day, seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   Under Army policies, Smith's emergency room was supposed to have
at least seven full-time certified ER physicians. But during the
summer of his arrival at Landstuhl, the number dropped to four when
departing physicians were not replaced.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1994, Lt. Col. David Gillingham arrived at Landstuhl as
the new chief of ambulatory care and Smith's immediate superior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we would get along fine,'' said Smith, who was
assigned to be Gillingham's sponsor to help with his processing and
moving needs. ``I picked him up at the airport and introduced him
to the community.''
</P>
<P>
   The cordiality vanished about a week later.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Gillingham rejected his request for additional ER
staffing even after being told the physicians were being forced to
work 50-60 hours per week, and Smith was forced to work 60-70 hours
a week to cover both ER shifts and his administrative duties.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting to discuss the ER staffing shortage, Gillingham's
reaction stunned and angered Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gillingham presided over the meeting and ordered me `to work
the ER doctors into the ground,''' Smith said. He quoted Gillingham
as saying of the young doctors, ``They are cannon fodder and have
to pay back (for) their training.'' The stress took a toll on
everyone working in the emergency room, including Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was marooned at work,'' Smith said. ``My family had to go on
tours alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who has battled clinical depression for most of his life,
said at one point he was hospitalized for nervous exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't dispute the fact that I became depressed as a result
of the situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In July that year, the number of available ER physicians dropped
from four to three after a junior physician suffered a nervous
breakdown, Smith said. Landstuhl officials eased the crisis by
rotating other doctors into the ER for several months.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's senior noncommissioned officer at Landstuhl, now-retired
Sgt. 1st Class Stanley Gaines, said in an interview that hospital
commanders refused to take steps to find qualified physicians for
the emergency room. He also said they attempted to pressure doctors
to minimize medical care to non-military patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have the amount of staff to adequately take care of
our patients,'' said Gaines, who now lives in Tyler, Texas. ``I
don't know the real reason, but we weren't getting supported and
people didn't care.''
</P>
<P>
   By mid-1994, Landstuhl was treating more than 23,000 emergency
cases a year _ an average of 63 per day _ but receiving
administrative credit for less than half that number, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has accused Gillingham, his supervisor who also ran the
hospital's family clinic, of diverting budget money and staffing
positions from the emergency room by falsely claiming that more
than 11,000 of the ER cases had actually been treated at the family
clinic. Smith said this enabled Gillingham to obtain money and
staffing support his facility otherwise would not have received.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were weak leaders and in a bad situation (with overall
budget cuts),'' Smith said of his bosses. ``They didn't mind
endangering patients to advance their careers.''
</P>
<P>
   That winter, Smith tried repeatedly to obtain support from his
commanders to prevent another ER staffing crisis in the summer
months when many physicians on temporary assignment to Landstuhl
normally returned to their home bases. Smith said he was promised
in February 1995 that the number of certified ER physicians would
be kept at a minimum of five _ still two below the Army minimum of
seven.
</P>
<P>
   Confrontation
</P>
<P>
   In May and June 1995, two events occurred at Landstuhl that set
Smith on a course of confrontation with his senior officers.
</P>
<P>
   On May 8, Smith reported that the beeper system for contacting
on-call ER doctors had failed the day before at a time the
emergency room experienced several major trauma cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't call in the specialists we needed to save lives,''
Smith said. ``In the spring, Germany is a beautiful place, and the
specialists are going to be out ... depending on their beepers if
there is an emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith requested an immediate replacement of the system. It
didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, his superiors became angry with him for pressing the
issue, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month later, while on duty as an ER physician,
Gillingham treated a 17-year-old civilian, the son of an Army
contract employee, who had suffered a head injury, Smith said.
Smith and Gaines say Gillingham sent the boy home with a written
diagnosis of abrasions even though the youth had sustained
prolonged loss of consciousness, had a severe headache and had no
memory of the event.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the youth was rushed back to Smith's emergency
room in a coma.
</P>
<P>
   Smith says the emergency room beeper system failed again and the
on-call neurosurgeon could not be located. In desperation, staffers
rushed the unconscious patient to another medical facility about 50
miles away for emergency brain surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The youth suffered permanent brain damage as a result of the
incident, according to the Hilton Head Island, S.C., Packet, the
newspaper in the young man's hometown.
</P>
<P>
   According to the newspaper, the boy's family last year filed a
$7.5 million claim against the Army, alleging malpractice. The Army
judge advocate general's office ruled the hospital had not acted
improperly. The Army has final review of claims filed against the
service's overseas facilities.
</P>
<P>
   After the office of Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., intervened, the
family was offered a settlement, a spokeswoman for Thurmond said.
Details of the settlement were not released.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Germany, things continued to get worse for Smith and his
emergency room staff. In September 1995, NATO carried out a fierce
air campaign in Bosnia that paved the way for the deployment of
40,000 U.S. and NATO troops into Bosnia. Landstuhl was earmarked to
handle any seriously injured peacekeepers. In a memo to one of his
supervisors, Col. Kevin Kiley, Smith said U.S. casualties would
overwhelm his emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between Smith and his staff on one side, and
higher-ups at Landstuhl on the other, continued to simmer. On Feb.
12, 1996, Smith formally submitted his complaint to the inspector
general at Landstuhl accusing Kiley of tolerating violations of
standards established by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of
Healthcare Organizations. The independent commission evaluates both
civilian and military hospitals for correct standards of practice
and administration.
</P>
<P>
   Smith alleged hospital officials were endangering patients by
purposely understaffing the emergency room and that his requests
for additional doctors were repeatedly ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, Kiley stripped Smith of his medical credentials
and ordered his immediate transfer to Madigan. Smith said different
officials at Landstuhl told him different things. At first, he
believed he would remain at Madigan for a brief medical checkup
before returning to Germany. Other Landstuhl officials indicated
Kiley had ordered a permanent transfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The paperwork was pretty confusing, as well,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   One assistant to Smith said the transfer was a reprisal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was done very viciously,'' said Gaines, the senior sergeant
in Smith's emergency room. ``He (Smith) wasn't being supported by
his superiors and made come calls they didn't like, so they struck
out at him instead of solving the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith packed his bags.
</P>
<P>
   Incarcerated at Madigan
</P>
<P>
   Twelve days after the confrontation with Kiley, Smith arrived
for duty at Madigan on Feb. 24, 1996, and to his shock was locked
up in the hospital psychiatric wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They handed me the pajamas that patients wear who are not
allowed out, and they told me I had to hand over all of my
possessions except for my uniform,'' Smith recounted. ``I was
stunned.''
</P>
<P>
   He has records from his trip that indicate he stopped at Army
Medical Command offices in Washington, D.C., en route to Madigan,
where he met with officials and conducted routine business. He said
there was no indication on his travel orders that he was to be
placed under medical supervision or constraint.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was released from the Madigan psychiatric unit in three
weeks, and was surprised when Madigan's ER director invited him to
join the ER staff. He had his medical credentials restored in full
after several weeks. ``It was as if the whole episode had not even
happened,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the incarceration violated numerous Army regulations
because there was neither a formal hearing or any written orders
committing him to the secure ward. He believes Kiley made a
telephone call to Madigan officials that led to his incarceration.
</P>
<P>
   Madigan officials declined comment on any specifics of Smith's
complaints, including the hospitalization, but insisted that no
patients are locked up without due process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't confine people in a hospital as a rule,'' said Col.
Jim Gilman, Madigan's chief of medical staff and Smith's current
superior.
</P>
<P>
   But when Smith continued in the following months to press for
Army and Pentagon investigations into Landstuhl, he said, officials
at the Pierce County facility began engaging in reprisals against
him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Smith said his medical credentials were restricted
again for a brief time after officials learneddependent
newspaper Army Times was investigating his case. And in September
1998, during a visit to Madigan by Dr. Sue Bailey, assistant
secretary of defense for health affairs, Smith said he was forcibly
detained by a security guard and dragged out of the area when he
approached Bailey, an acquaintance from medical school.
</P>
<P>
   Smith filed a criminal complaint with the Fort Lewis criminal
investigative detachment as a result of the dragging incident.
Several weeks later, he said, Maj. Gen. Mack Hill, commander of
Madigan Army Medical Center, again restricted his medical practice
rights. Hill, like other Army officials, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said this complaint has been in limbo for more than a
year. In March, the credentials committee at Madigan voted to
restore his authority to practice medicine. He is currently fully
active in the hospital's adult primary care clinic.
</P>
<P>
   The Price of Whistle-blowing
</P>
<P>
   Married with two sons, one of whom still lives at home, Smith
said the stresses of the past year had become so great that he took
his family therapist's suggestion and temporarily moved out of his
home. ``We decided to separate until the stress of this business
was less,'' Smith said. ``I'm trying to protect her from all of
this,'' he said of his wife, Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Deeply in debt from legal expenses, Smith said the only
temporary housing he could afford was a tent staked at a campsite
at North Fort Lewis, where Smith goes every day at the end of his
medical shift at Madigan.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he finally decided to request early retirement from
the Army but his application remains bogged down in the
bureaucracy. Smith also is at the mercy of Madigan officials _ the
same officials whom he said have engaged in reprisals against him _
to complete the routine paperwork that would allow him to apply for
his state medical license.
</P>
<P>
   Smith remains in what he calls ``suspended animation,'' waiting
for the Army to respond to his retirement request. He wants to get
on with his life and work as an emergency room doctor in the
civilian community. He looks forward to rejoining his family. He
visits them on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the three Army officials Smith accuses of improper
actions at Landstuhl remain on active duty.
</P>
<P>
   Kiley, the former Landstuhl commander, is a two-star general
serving as assistant Army surgeon general and deputy chief of staff
for force projection. He supervises all Army physicians. Kiley
declined a request to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   An Army Medical Command spokeswoman said Kiley has recused
himself from any personnel decisions involving Smith. ``He has
declined to comment on this issue,'' said spokeswoman Cynthia
Vaughan.
</P>
<P>
   Gillingham, Smith's direct superior at Landstuhl, is now a
student at the U.S. Army War College in Carlisle, Pa. He also
declined comment on Smith's allegations.

FISHERS: COMING TO A FOREST NEAR YOU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICKI CROKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is slinky, stealthy, handsome, and mysterious.
</P>
<P>
   With equal parts dexterity and daring, it regularly dines on
porcupine and raccoon. An elusive predator, it sees but is rarely
seen, though it can be counted in the thousands. Still, it is large
enough that those who do catch a quick glimpse often mistake it for
a mountain lion.
</P>
<P>
   And, as its population rebounds from being wiped out in this
state at the turn of the century, there will be more sightings.
</P>
<P>
   According to director Matt Laing at the New England Wildlife
Center, one was brought to the clinic two years ago with a broken
leg, after having been hit by a car.
</P>
<P>
   Tom French, assistant director in the Massachusetts Division of
Fisheries and Wildlife, says he saw one in his own neighborhood
near Sturbridge, Mass., and knows of a family, in a suburb north of
Boston that found its black Lab barking at one that was growling
atop the rabbit hutch, pet bunny firmly held in its jaws.
</P>
<P>
   Who is this mystery animal? The fisher, one of North America's
most intriguing predators. The beefy cousin to the marten.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad we don't get to see them more often because they
are beautiful. Martes pennanti is described as a magnificent member
of the weasel family, with a long, slim body and a bushy tail. The
fisher has a thick rich dark chocolate-to-almost-black coat. It's
leonine air has led to the nickname the ``black cat.'' And though
it does get mistaken for a mountain lion, it weighs considerably
less _ only 10 to at most 25 pounds. It's more fox than Simba size.
</P>
<P>
   Still, fishers are impressive. Using strong, thick,
semi-retractile claws, they will rip up the trunk of a small tree
in pursuit of a squirrel and barrel back down, head first. National
Geographic's dusty old ``Wild Animals of North America'' gushes
over their athleticism: ``for their size, by far the swiftest and
most deadly of all forest carnivores . . . able to make astonishing
leaps from tree to tree . . . It is fearless and savage . . . And
worthy of all due respect from antagonists several times its
size.'' But the book, published in 1918, sadly notes that the
animal was fast disappearing from its southern boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   French confirms they are multiplying here as we head into the
next century, with family farms sharply decreasing and woodland _
fisher habitat _ returning.
</P>
<P>
   And though fishers, like coyotes, may snatch a house cat once in
a while, they are not prone to ``mischief,'' according to the old
book and current biologists. For the most part, they don't want to
be near us. (Who can blame them?)
</P>
<P>
   Todd Fuller, professor of wildlife ecology in the Department of
Natural Resources Conservation at the University of
Massachusetts-Amherst, is a fisher intimate. He and a student
worked on a three-year study of the animals, in the north central
area of the state, including the Quabbin Reservoir area.
</P>
<P>
   He found fishers to be fearless opportunists who eat everything
from raccoons to blueberries and apples, though squirrels make up
the biggest part of their diets. (No, you can't have a fisher as a
pet.)
</P>
<P>
   No one really knows why they are called fishers _ they don't eat
much fish. It probably has more to do with a funny translation than
hunting behavior.
</P>
<P>
   And that behavior impresses Fuller. The low-slung carnivores
will come up under a porcupine to get at the quill-less belly in
order to dispatch it. They then basically turn the prey item inside
out, leaving that troublesome hide behind like a child's coat
tossed on the floor. They can do all that, French reports, without
falling victim to a single spine.
</P>
<P>
   He says the fisher is ``a single-minded, cantankerous hunter.''
Fuller can describe the fisher in three words: ``Smart. Adaptable.
Tough.'' Yet he was amazed that during the study, when confronted
by a human hand in their tree hollow dens, mother fishers would
never bite.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Laing, of the New England Wildlife Center, recalls the one
fisher who was successfully treated. It took six weeks for the
aggressive, furious animal's leg to mend. This little fisher never
grew fond of his caretakers and thrashed and growled whenever they
approached.
</P>
<P>
   It's always a happy moment when an animal is returned to the
wild. But in this case, Laing reports, there was extra cheer to see
him go.

WHAT LINDA TRIPP REALLY DESERVES IS ...
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was one of those moments that burrows deep into the memory
but readily scurries to the surface whenever we hear the name. Who
can forget Linda Tripp standing in front of the TV cameras and
assuring the American people: ``I'm you. 'm just like you.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like who? Not me. No way.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I don't know anyone who's just like Linda Tripp. I am
exceedingly grateful for that.
</P>
<P>
   Linda ``Just Like You'' Tripp now stands accused of a crime, a
minor one to be sure: tape-recording a telephone conversation
without the other party's knowledge or permission. But the
ramifications were far more serious.
</P>
<P>
   By illegally taping her conversations with ex-friend Monica
Lewinsky _ and blabbing about the contents of the tapes to Newsweek
magazine and independent counsel Ken Starr _ Tripp almost brought
down the president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Almost, but not quite.
</P>
<P>
   Which must have been a tremendous disappointment for Tripp and
her Clinton-hating pal, New York book agent Lucianne Goldberg. It
was Goldberg, as devotees of the White House sex-and-lies scandal
surely recall, who advised Tripp to record those telephone
heart-to-hearts in which Lewinsky revealed her sexual encounters
with Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes bought Tripp 15 minutes of fame, a federal immunity
deal with the independent counsel's office, an extended visit with
Starr's grand jury _ and a long-term role as a punch line in Jay
Leno's ``Tonight Show'' monologues.
</P>
<P>
   They also bought her this criminal charge in the state of
Maryland, which took exception to her violations of its laws
against wiretapping.
</P>
<P>
   A court hearing is being conducted this week to determine if
Maryland authorities have sufficient grounds to put Tripp on trial.
Tripp, oddly enough, has been saying that she wants to stand trial
because she remains convinced that she did the right thing when she
pushed the ``record'' button on her tape machine.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's son, Ryan Tripp, attended Thursday's court session and
was quoted by The Associated Press as saying that he wanted his mom
to be tried so that she ``can be completely vindicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Vindication, it would seem, is in the eye of the beholder.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Tripp didn't attend _ ``She's got to work for a living,''
Ryan said _ and so she missed the opportunity to stare down
Lewinsky as the president's former, uh, girlfriend testified for
the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp may get another chance to confront the former White House
intern. Lewinsky will be a key witness if the case goes to trial.
</P>
<P>
   If the case goes to trial is a decision to be made by a judge,
as we know, but just about everyone else is allowed to weigh in on
another question: Should the case go to trial?
</P>
<P>
   Tripp has her partisans _ I know this because I heard from most
of them the last time I disparaged her in print _ and they insist
that the criminal proceedings in Maryland amount to nothing more
than retaliation for her participation in Starr's investigation of
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Can't argue with that.
</P>
<P>
   But is the retaliation deserved? Should Tripp pay some sort of
price for breaking an obscure law en route to touching off a
scandal that virtually paralyzed the U.S. government for more than
a year? Should she be held accountable for what may have been a
massive betrayal of a friend's trust but was merely a technical
violation of law?
</P>
<P>
   Tripp is a despicable character, to be sure. For my money, she's
guilty of felonious audacity for making that ``just like you''
comment after her grand jury testimony last year. Calling herself
an ``average American'' was an affront to average Americans, most
of whom would never dream of selling out a friend the way that
Tripp sold out Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But only the most vengeful Clintonista could believe that Tripp
ought to face criminal charges. The scandal is over. Clinton beat
the rap. Why dredge it all up again just to prosecute Tripp for, in
effect, being a jerk?
</P>
<P>
   I say we'd all be better off if the judge would sentence Tripp
to one more year of Leno jokes and let it go at that.

   CATALOG-SHOPPING (New York) _ Catalogs are supposed to be the
answer to our holiday shopping needs. But they turned out to be the
paper equivalent of shops I call close-but-no-cigar stores, where
everything is sort of nice but you don't really want to buy
anything. As it turns out, the most useful catalog I received this
season was from Eddie Bauer Home. I rolled it up and used it to
kill a water bug the size of a Volkswagen. By Frank DeCaro. &QL;

<P>
   SEASONAL-PARTY-ANXIETY (New York) _ This year, Millennial Eve
has cranked the Seasonal Party Anxiety (SPA) dial up to 11. It's as
if anyone not popping magnums of Cristal with the right people
(Hillary! Puffy!) and at the coolest place (St. Bart's! Bali!) will
be branded a loser. By Rick Marin.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   STORE-SPRITZERS (New York) _ There are other ways emerging to
sell perfume other than using human spritzers. This has, after all,
been called the first big e-Christmas, and Sephora, the
trend-setting French beauty store, where perfumes are arranged
alphabetically for customers to sample on their own, has just
opened its United States flagship with much fanfare in Manhattan.
The success of either or both of these retail channels could
eventually mean an end to spritzers. By Lauren Goldstein. Photo. &QL;

<P>
   HOLIDAY-PLASTIC-SURGEON (New York) _ Presents wrapped? Check.
Holiday cards sent out? Check. Waistline reduced to fit into dress
for New Year's Eve? Oops. Don't worry, it's not too late. So say
some New York plastic surgeons, who report that they are working
double time this month to help patients look their millennium best.

   NITEOUT-HAPPNER (New York) _ ``Excuse me while I slip into
something a bit more flame-retardant,'' said Ben Heppner, the
Canadian tenor who concluded his role as Tristan in the
Metropolitan Opera's sold-out ``Tristan und Isolde'' with
Saturday's broadcast performance. Speaking to fans at the Canadian
Consulate in Midtown Manhattan on Wednesday night, Heppner was
quoting his own joke from other Wagner operas he has performed
around the world, many of which utilize smoke or fire.
Flame-retardant or otherwise, Heppner, 43, has become a superhero

   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ Nature has more shades of green than a

grateful. The blossoms may be what we most covet, but it's the
foliage we most look at _ especially in shady areas, where blooming
plants are hard to come by. By Cass Peterson. &QL;

&HT;     SAILORS WITH TIES TO PUERTO RICO SAY NAVY SHOULD GIVE UP
VIEQUES  
</HEADLINE>
 (For release Sunday, Dec. 19.)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL   
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD USS DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER _ Ismael Virole III, a New
Yorker with family ties to Puerto Rico, skillfully matches
missiles, bombs and bullets with Navy warplanes before the aircraft
catapult off the flight deck of this airport-at-sea.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy used to fire this type of ordnance at a beach-front
target range on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques before a popular
clamor forced the service to abandon 58 years of integrated live
fire combat training there.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-ship battle group led by the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower
will sail in February for the Persian Gulf without having conducted
live-fire combat rehearsals at Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   That's just fine with Virole, 22, a four-year veteran of duties
on the Eisenhower, who wears the red shirt of an aviation ordnance
specialist working on the flight deck.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing a good job training without Vieques,'' says
Virole. ``If Puerto Rico says they want the Navy to leave Vieques,
the United States should respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Another sailor, David Alvarado, a native of Arecibo, Puerto
Rico, says some members of his family back home like to pester him
with questions about why the Navy wants to resume bombing, shelling
and strafing the Vieques target range, which has been closed since
a bombing accident killed a Navy contract security guard last
April.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarado, a petty officer with 15 years of Navy service, also
says he sympathizes with the demands of Puerto Ricans that the Navy
should get out of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are afraid of what kinds of weapons the Navy will throw
in there,'' says Alvarado, who wears the white shirt of a
storekeeper and cargo handler on the flight deck.
</P>
<P>
   But Alvarado is equally sympathetic with the Navy's insistence
that it must conduct integrated live-fire combat training before
deploying to potential hot spots like the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to train to be ready,'' says Alvarado. ``You can't go
into the ring without being ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Soto, 22, a sailor from Arecibo, Puerto Rico with 19 months
in the Navy, says he also supports Puerto Ricans' campaign to have
the Navy withdraw from Vieques and turn over the land to local
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The bitter standoff between the Navy and Puerto Rico over the
use of the Vieques target range falls heavily on the shoulders of
some sailors aboard this aircraft carrier who voice loyalties to
both the Navy and to their families and friends in Puerto Rico who
want the Navy to give up 22,000-acres of Navy-owned land and find a
target range elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy owns two-thirds of the 52-square mile island with the
other one-third inhabited by more than 9,300 residents. All Puerto
Ricans are U.S. citizens by birth and eligible for military
service.
</P>
<P>
   The fatal accident has ignited a rare crusade, rallying many of
Puerto Rico's 3.8 million residents as well as the 2.8 million
other Puerto Ricans who live in New York City, New Jersey, Illinois
and other enclaves across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico's political leaders and allies such as First Lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Vice
President Al Gore, have united to demand an end to Navy combat
exercises and the Navy's phased withdrawal from Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 2,700 sailors aboard the USS Eisenhower are several
hundred Hispanic-Americans _ some of whom trace their family ties
back to Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Navy Capt. H. Denby Starling II, commander of the 1,092-foot
ship that will lead the battle group to the Mediterranean and
Persian Gulf on Feb. 18, has tried to keep sailors abreast of
developments in Vieques with straight-forward daily updates.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, Starling says, has been to ``better educate Ike
warriors on the Vieques issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Sailors aboard the Eisenhower said they learned only after
leaving port in early December that their battle group was being
diverted from final combat training on Vieques. Instead, the
flotilla was directed to train at an improvised patchwork of sites
along the East Coast. The result: Pilots, Marines and naval gunfire
crews trained separately without the final all-out three-day war
that has readied departing Navy battle groups for decades.
</P>
<P>
   For most sailors, the location of their training makes little
difference. ``For the guys who assemble the bombs, it's all the
same to us whether we're off Vieques or North Carolina,'' says Navy
Cdr. Duane Nestor, 38, of Belle Fourche, S.D., the red-shirted
``gun boss'' in charge of the 23 ordnance magazines located as far
as 11 decks below the ``roof'' where planes land and depart.
</P>
<P>
   But sailors from Puerto Rico say they closely followed the
Vieques controversy, an issue that tugs at their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarado, who served for five months on Vieques with the Navy
Seabees, says that sailors aboard U.S. warships offshore can't know
what its like to be on the island when Navy warships are firing
5-inch guns and Navy and Marine warplanes are bombing as Marines
storm ashore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not there to feel the full impact of all that,'' says
Alvarado.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the dispute, Puerto Rico's political leaders have
emphasized that their crusade to oust the Navy from Vieques does
not signal anti-Navy sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico's rate of military enlistment tops 49 states and is
exceeded only by Hawaii's. More than 200,000 Puerto Ricans have
served in the armed forces since the United Sates annexed the
island in 1898 during the Spanish-American War. Four Puerto Rican
GIs have been awarded the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest
award for battlefield valor.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico's political leaders support continued operations at
the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station, an 8,600-acre installation on
the main island of Puerto Rico that employs 5,000 people, including
2,500 civilians, pumping $300 million a year into Puerto Rico's
economy.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here _ optional material follows.) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Eisenhower sailors from Puerto Rico say they joined the Navy
to forge greater personal discipline and open the door to wider
professional opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Virole, 22, will complete his five-year commitment next year,
leaving the Navy with credit for as many as five college-level
courses to get a head start on the college education in New York
City that he hopes to underwrite with $30,000 in GI education
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Navy is good work as long as you stay focused and work to
get what you need out of your service,'' says Virole, a native of
Brookyn, N.Y., whose parents were born in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Soto says he also joined the Navy to help pay for college.
</P>
<P>
   Many young recruits join the Navy as single sailors, only to get
married and have children during their first tour, taking on
financial responsibilities that often make re-enlistment too
attractive to pass up.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not for Soto.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call that `getting stuck,''' Soto explains. ``And I'm not
going to `get stuck.'''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Soto says there are plenty of appealing moments in the Navy.
He still looks back fondly to October when this Norfolk, Va.-based
nuclear-powered behemoth slipped into the familiar azure waters of
the Caribbean to drill off Puerto Rico without using live ordnance
on the target range on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   The range has been closed since April 19 when a Marine pilot
mistakenly bombed the range observation post, killing Navy contract
security guard David Sanes Rodriguez, 35, and injuring four
civilian range workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never got ashore while we were down off Puerto Rico,'' says
Soto. `But I felt like I was home, just seeing the sea and the sky.
I loved it. But I'm not getting distracted. I'm going to college.''

&HT;     POLICE ACCUSED OF MURDER TO GET TRIAL OUT OF BRONX 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MELISSA GRACE  
 &HT;     c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A state appeals court has ruled that the trial of
four white police officers accused of murdering a West African
immigrant be moved to Albany, finding that media coverage had made
it impossible to pick an impartial jury in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Coming just three weeks before the trial in the slaying of
Amadou Diallo was set to begin, the rare change-of-venue ruling on
Thursday was hailed by defense attorneys and condemned by
prosecutors and civil rights leaders.
</P>
<P>
   It also left judges in Albany contemplating the possibility they
would preside over one of the most sensational cases of alleged
police brutality in recent history.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we need is a fair jury,'' said Steven Brounstein, the
Queens-based defense attorney representing Officer Kenneth Boss.
</P>
<P>
   Brounstein and three other defense attorneys petitioned an
appeals court in Manhattan in November requesting the change.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 4, Diallo, 22, was unarmed and standing in the vestibule
of his Bronx apartment building when the four officers opened fire
on him, hitting him with 19 of 41 shots. Officers in New York
City's Street Crime Unit had been looking for a rapist-murderer in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   The officers _ Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon, Richard Murphy and
Boss _ were indicted on second-degree murder counts in March. Each
has pleaded not guilty, saying the shooting was justified. If
convicted, each faces a prison term of 25 years to life.
</P>
<P>
   Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson, whose office opposed the
move, is considering an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still reviewing the decision,'' said Steven Reed,
Johnson's spokesman. ``We don't know if we can appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed declined to comment further on the case. Johnson's office
will prosecute the case whether it is held in the Bronx or Albany.
</P>
<P>
   In its 11-page decision, the Appellate Division of state Supreme
Court, First Department, said massive media coverage of the event
and demonstrations that followed justified moving the trial, and
sought to relocate it to a county similar to the Bronx. It selected
Albany because it said the county is urban and demographically
diverse _ and because it is closer to New York City than the other
counties that fit that description, Erie, Monroe and Onondaga.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, defense attorneys had argued to have the case
moved because it ``has long been the conventional wisdom among the
legal community in the Bronx that jurors harbor an existing
prejudice against police officers.''
</P>
<P>
   In Albany, juries are largely seen as conservative and willing
to accept the testimony of the police over others. Also, in Albany,
where the African-American population is about 8 percent, the jury
pool is more heavily white than in the Bronx, where blacks make up
42 percent of the residents. Diallo was black, and the officers
accused of shooting him are white.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys had asked the court to move the trial to
Westchester County, which adjoins Bronx County. But the court said
that ``within reasonable limits,'' the community selected must
reflect the community in which the event occurred, and found Albany
more suitable.
</P>
<P>
   The decision took some legal observers by surprise and outraged
the Diallo family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We respect the rules but it is not fair,'' Katiadou Diallo,
Amadou's mother, told a news conference in Manhattan Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trial should take place in the Bronx. ... No family should
suffer the way we have suffered, no family should cry the way we
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Diallo's death sparked massive demonstrations and reignited a
debate about racism in the city's police force. More than 1,000
people, including high ranking state officials, were arrested in
the demonstrations, led by the Rev. Al Sharpton. More
demonstrations were expected outside the Bronx courthouse at the
start of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the protesters are likely to converge on Albany, with
perhaps busloads of protesters, and supporters, commuting to
upstate New York.

HOLIDAY PARTIES SEND SOCIAL ANXIETY SOARING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Dec. 19)  
(lh) 
 By RICK MARIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's time to be bitter _ at least for those of us
prone to the pain of not being invited to swanky Christmas parties
and epic bacchanals ringing in the new year.
</P>
<P>
   ``All parties are held against someone,'' is a line I once heard
attributed to Oscar Wilde. And for sufferers of what might be
called Seasonal Party Anxiety (SPA), December is the cruelest
month.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Millennial Eve has cranked the SPA dial up to 11.
It's as if anyone not popping magnums of Cristal with the right
people (Hillary! Puffy!) and at the coolest place (St. Bart's!
Bali!) will be branded a loser. Posterity's patsy.
</P>
<P>
   The list of Christmas parties passing me by grows longer every
day. And for New Year's Eve, I have been asked nowhere. News of one
Eve event to which I was not invited, a modest affair on the
mid-outer rim of my social circle, induced a flashback to my dark
days as a free-lance writer.
</P>
<P>
   Crazed with cabin fever in my fifth-floor walkup, I felt every
social slight during the holiday season. Hunched over my Powerbook,
I'd fantasize about life in offices. There, I reasoned, amid all
those fancy cubicles and free copy machines, careers were being
made, expense accounts forged, flirtations consummated. I jumped at
every office Christmas bash that came my way and stewed over every
one that didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Was I _ am I _ alone in this madness? Not entirely, it seems.
Diagnosticians of the New York psyche know well the issues of this
notoriously depressed time of year.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen Josephson, a psychologist with a private practice on
the Upper East Side, said he has been encountering a lot of
``perfectionistic expectations'' for New Year's Eve. ``I've heard
it a lot,'' he said. ``People are feeling that everyone else is
having a good time, and they will be very self-critical if they're
not invited to this affair or that affair.''
</P>
<P>
   As Dr. Paul Michael Ramirez, a neuropsychologist with a practice
in Westchester County, put it: ``This is a milestone in the history
of the civilization. Imagine sitting at home hearing parties going
on around you. Just thinking about it makes me depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, few people suffering from SPA are willing to admit to
it, at least on the record. They want to maintain a front of
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   But one New York film critic, who asked not to be identified to
preserve his image, confessed to pangs of night-life envy around
this time of year. ``You hear about Christmas parties or you read
about them in the paper, and it always makes one feel worse about
one's life in New York,'' he said. ``It gives me a stab of
self-doubt, like, `Oh, why wasn't I there?''' A fashion publicist
who also requested anonymity has a different beef: reciprocity, or
lack thereof.
</P>
<P>
   ``After organizing so many parties, it's always kind of a smack
in the face not to be invited,'' he said. ``I'm so careful about
making sure I get all the right people. I guess I'm not all the
right people.''
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Harper's Bazaar published a list of the right
people from the New York whirl, the ones who are ``Invited
Everywhere.'' I wondered if members of the genetically and
financially advantaged classes might occasionally be stricken with
SPA. If so, then the rest of us commoners need not feel so bad.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the Bazaar list was Serena Altschul, the MTV News
presenter, who grew up on Fifth Avenue. ``I got a stack of
invitations and promptly RSVP'd no to all of them,'' Ms. Altschul
said. Those envelopes included offers to join in the VIP
festivities hosted by Puff Daddy and the Artist Formerly Known as
Prince. ``My problem is usually the inverse: parties I go to that I
wish I hadn't,'' Ms. Altschul said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   True socialites are unlikely to confess to social anxiety, even
if they do feel its sting.
</P>
<P>
   But Ahn Duong, an artist and exotic beauty in high demand, was
willing to acknowledge a chink in her fabulous armor. ``How can you
find the perfect party for the millennium?'' she said. ``That's a
lot of pressure.'' Not so much that she wasn't able to arrive at
the perfect solution: spending New Year's on a yacht off Mustique
and visiting her parents in Paris. Anyway, she added, ``if I really
want to, I can always get invited.''
</P>
<P>
   George Plimpton has been a mainstay of the beau monde for many
decades. Ostracism is for him a distant memory. ``You read about
parties in the papers and think, `Why wasn't I there?''' he said.
``I'm getting over that.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For social alpinists, certain pro-active techniques can increase
the invitation odds. Kristina Stewart, the editor of Quest, says
that many of her readers are not above waging pre-emptive
Christmas-card campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get a card right after Thanksgiving, you know the
person wants to go to your party,'' Ms. Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   But of course, the truly confident don't care. David Koch, the
billionaire known for playing gregarious host at lavish blowouts at
his various houses, is for the first time in 10 years not giving
his annual New Year's Eve party in Aspen, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, people have been calling me up with this sense of
desperation, wondering if I'm having a party and whether they're
invited,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Koch and his wife, Julia, have not yet been asked to anyone
else's big New Year's Eve bash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm letting it be known that we are available to be invited
out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise.

ON FOLIAGE, GREEN KINDLY SHARES THE SPOTLIGHT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 19) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CASS PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nature has more shades of green than a super-size box of
crayons, for which gardeners ought to be properly grateful. The
blossoms may be what we most covet, but it's the foliage we most
look at _ especially in shady areas, where blooming plants are hard
to come by.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible to put together a lovely garden relying on nothing
more than the varied colors and textures of foliage, even in areas
of full sun. One of my favorite borders is planted in ornamental
grasses, Silver King artemesia and Autumn Joy sedum.
</P>
<P>
   The silver-white artemesia is like a cloud come to earth between
the forest-green miscanthus and the blue-green sedum, and I almost
regret when it's time for all three to bloom.
</P>
<P>
   In another category of plants prized more for their foliage than
for their flowers are those with variegated or multicolored leaves.
The leaves might be green edged with silver or gold, or streaked
and mottled with white or yellow on a green background, or two
shades of green, maybe even mixed with other colors.
</P>
<P>
   Plants with variegated foliage seem to be growing in popularity,
judging by the number of two-toned versions of popular perennials
that have been appearing in garden catalogs. In the last few years
I've been tempted by a variegated daphne, a spectacular silver and
green Jacob's ladder, and a bicolored Solomon's seal, not to
mention the ever-expanding range of variegated hostas and hollies.
</P>
<P>
   Like plants with silvery, pale green or golden foliage, plants
with variegated leaves are useful for brightening dark corners and
adding pizazz to garden beds. But they're a little trickier to use
effectively and much easier to overdo, especially in large areas.
</P>
<P>
   A small clump of dwarf white-margined hosta, like Honeysong or
Patriot, is lovely by itself in a shady niche. Nestled along the
edge of a larger bed of solid-colored hostas, a gold-bordered hosta
like Aureomarginata or the green-bordered gold leaves of Peedee
Goldflash add a little sparkle. But a large bed planted entirely in
variegated hostas just looks hyperactive.
</P>
<P>
   Even more treacherous is planting two variegated species
together. Goutweed (Aegopodium), lungwort (Pulmonaria) and dead
nettle (Lamium) are all good ground covers for semishady areas, and
all come in excellent silvery or white-speckled varieties. Any one
is a garden standout. Any two or more planted in the same bed have
the same effect on the eyeballs as plaid mixed with polka dots.
</P>
<P>
   Some variegated plants, like silver variegated thyme, have tiny,
delicately marked leaves, and the overall effect is a lightly
misted shade of green. The variegation is so subtle that the plants
can be treated as solid-color specimens.
</P>
<P>
   But other plants are not so understated. Sedum Frosty Morn
(green leaves boldly edged white), showy calamint (Calamintha
grandiflora, with irregular white blotches on medium green leaves)
and Burgundy Glow bugleweed (Ajuga reptans, a variety with
tricolored leaves of green, white and pink) are attention-getters,
best planted with moderation.
</P>
<P>
   Bugleweed is an aggressive spreader that doesn't believe in
moderation, so you'll have to restrict that one by planting it
where it can be confined _ between the driveway and the house, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   Variegated foliage is generally an inherited characteristic,
caused by a lack of the green chlorophyll pigment in some parts of
the plant's leaves. Because chlorophyll is responsible for
photosynthesis, variegated plants _ which have less of it than
their all-green counterparts _ often grow more slowly than
all-green plants. That's something to keep in mind if you want to
grow variegated and solid-green versions of the same species
together.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally a variegated plant will produce solid green leaves
as a mutation. Those leaves should be removed. They will be more
vigorous because of their additional chlorophyll, and could
eventually crowd out the variegated foliage.
</P>
<P>
   Some plants have variegated foliage because they have been
intentionally infected with a mosaic virus, a plant disease that
produces the symptom of mottled leaves or flowers. The infected
plant is able to grow and flower despite the virus, which is of a
strain that either doesn't affect other plants or is not easily
spread to them.
</P>
<P>
   Rembrandt tulips, with their strikingly streaked petals, are an
example of virus-induced variegation, as are the yellow and green
flecked leaves of Chinese flowering maple (Abutilon). Abutilon is
usually grown indoors in winter or in patio pots outdoors in
summer, but it's vigorous enough to grow in the open garden. It's
an eye-catching plant, best used sparingly.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible to use variegated plants in annual gardens, too.
One of my favorites for shady or semishady areas is Summer Ice
double impatiens, which pairs silver-edged foliage with rosebudlike
flowers.
</P>
<P>
   In garden beds, the brighter flower colors, like scarlet and
purple, show off the foliage best. The paler peach- and
pink-flowered plants are better in pots and window boxes, where
both blossoms and leaves can be seen close up.
</P>
<P>
   For sunny areas, Alaska nasturtium is a dwarf variety with
marbled green and cream foliage, and there's a climbing version
called Jewel of Africa that will zip up an eight-foot trellis.
</P>
<P>
   Tricolor variegata hot pepper is a great annual for growing in
containers or in the garden. It could go in the vegetable garden,
but that would be a waste of its spectacular tricolored foliage of
green and white generously mottled with purple. It bears small
cone-shaped peppers that start purple and eventually ripen red.
They're edible, very hot, and form in attractive clusters _
nature's little bonus on top of that gorgeous variegated foliage.

&HT;     SAILORS WITH TIES TO PUERTO RICO SAY NAVY SHOULD GIVE UP
VIEQUES  
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, Dec. 19.)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL   
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD USS DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER _ Ismael Virole III, a New
Yorker with family ties to Puerto Rico, skillfully matches
missiles, bombs and bullets with Navy warplanes before the aircraft
catapult off the flight deck of this airport-at-sea.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy used to fire this type of ordnance at a beach-front
target range on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques before a popular
clamor forced the service to abandon 58 years of integrated live
fire combat training there.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-ship battle group led by the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower
will sail in February for the Persian Gulf without having conducted
live-fire combat rehearsals at Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   That's just fine with Virole, 22, a four-year veteran of duties
on the Eisenhower, who wears the red shirt of an aviation ordnance
specialist working on the flight deck.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing a good job training without Vieques,'' says
Virole. ``If Puerto Rico says they want the Navy to leave Vieques,
the United States should respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Another sailor, David Alvarado, a native of Arecibo, Puerto
Rico, says some members of his family back home like to pester him
with questions about why the Navy wants to resume bombing, shelling
and strafing the Vieques target range, which has been closed since
a bombing accident killed a Navy contract security guard last
April.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarado, a petty officer with 15 years of Navy service, also
says he sympathizes with the demands of Puerto Ricans that the Navy
should get out of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are afraid of what kinds of weapons the Navy will throw
in there,'' says Alvarado, who wears the white shirt of a
storekeeper and cargo handler on the flight deck.
</P>
<P>
   But Alvarado is equally sympathetic with the Navy's insistence
that it must conduct integrated live-fire combat training before
deploying to potential hot spots like the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to train to be ready,'' says Alvarado. ``You can't go
into the ring without being ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Soto, 22, a sailor from Arecibo, Puerto Rico with 19 months
in the Navy, says he also supports Puerto Ricans' campaign to have
the Navy withdraw from Vieques and turn over the land to local
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The bitter standoff between the Navy and Puerto Rico over the
use of the Vieques target range falls heavily on the shoulders of
some sailors aboard this aircraft carrier who voice loyalties to
both the Navy and to their families and friends in Puerto Rico who
want the Navy to give up 22,000-acres of Navy-owned land and find a
target range elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy owns two-thirds of the 52-square mile island with the
other one-third inhabited by more than 9,300 residents. All Puerto
Ricans are U.S. citizens by birth and eligible for military
service.
</P>
<P>
   The fatal accident has ignited a rare crusade, rallying many of
Puerto Rico's 3.8 million residents as well as the 2.8 million
other Puerto Ricans who live in New York City, New Jersey, Illinois
and other enclaves across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico's political leaders and allies such as First Lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Vice
President Al Gore, have united to demand an end to Navy combat
exercises and the Navy's phased withdrawal from Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 2,700 sailors aboard the USS Eisenhower are several
hundred Hispanic-Americans _ some of whom trace their family ties
back to Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Navy Capt. H. Denby Starling II, commander of the 1,092-foot
ship that will lead the battle group to the Mediterranean and
Persian Gulf on Feb. 18, has tried to keep sailors abreast of
developments in Vieques with straight-forward daily updates.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, Starling says, has been to ``better educate Ike
warriors on the Vieques issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Sailors aboard the Eisenhower said they learned only after
leaving port in early December that their battle group was being
diverted from final combat training on Vieques. Instead, the
flotilla was directed to train at an improvised patchwork of sites
along the East Coast. The result: Pilots, Marines and naval gunfire
crews trained separately without the final all-out three-day war
that has readied departing Navy battle groups for decades.
</P>
<P>
   For most sailors, the location of their training makes little
difference. ``For the guys who assemble the bombs, it's all the
same to us whether we're off Vieques or North Carolina,'' says Navy
Cdr. Duane Nestor, 38, of Belle Fourche, S.D., the red-shirted
``gun boss'' in charge of the 23 ordnance magazines located as far
as 11 decks below the ``roof'' where planes land and depart.
</P>
<P>
   But sailors from Puerto Rico say they closely followed the
Vieques controversy, an issue that tugs at their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarado, who served for five months on Vieques with the Navy
Seabees, says that sailors aboard U.S. warships offshore can't know
what its like to be on the island when Navy warships are firing
5-inch guns and Navy and Marine warplanes are bombing as Marines
storm ashore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not there to feel the full impact of all that,'' says
Alvarado.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the dispute, Puerto Rico's political leaders have
emphasized that their crusade to oust the Navy from Vieques does
not signal anti-Navy sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico's rate of military enlistment tops 49 states and is
exceeded only by Hawaii's. More than 200,000 Puerto Ricans have
served in the armed forces since the United Sates annexed the
island in 1898 during the Spanish-American War. Four Puerto Rican
GIs have been awarded the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest
award for battlefield valor.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico's political leaders support continued operations at
the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station, an 8,600-acre installation on
the main island of Puerto Rico that employs 5,000 people, including
2,500 civilians, pumping $300 million a year into Puerto Rico's
economy.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here _ optional material follows.) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Eisenhower sailors from Puerto Rico say they joined the Navy
to forge greater personal discipline and open the door to wider
professional opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Virole, 22, will complete his five-year commitment next year,
leaving the Navy with credit for as many as five college-level
courses to get a head start on the college education in New York
City that he hopes to underwrite with $30,000 in GI education
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Navy is good work as long as you stay focused and work to
get what you need out of your service,'' says Virole, a native of
Brookyn, N.Y., whose parents were born in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Soto says he also joined the Navy to help pay for college.
</P>
<P>
   Many young recruits join the Navy as single sailors, only to get
married and have children during their first tour, taking on
financial responsibilities that often make re-enlistment too
attractive to pass up.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not for Soto.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call that `getting stuck,''' Soto explains. ``And I'm not
going to `get stuck.'''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Soto says there are plenty of appealing moments in the Navy.
He still looks back fondly to October when this Norfolk, Va.-based
nuclear-powered behemoth slipped into the familiar azure waters of
the Caribbean to drill off Puerto Rico without using live ordnance
on the target range on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   The range has been closed since April 19 when a Marine pilot
mistakenly bombed the range observation post, killing Navy contract
security guard David Sanes Rodriguez, 35, and injuring four
civilian range workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never got ashore while we were down off Puerto Rico,'' says
Soto. `But I felt like I was home, just seeing the sea and the sky.
I loved it. But I'm not getting distracted. I'm going to college.''

IN SEARCH OF SALES HELP THAT IS HELPFUL, I TURNED TO CYPERSPACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Calif.)   (For release Sunday, Dec. 19)  
(DW) 
 By FRANK DeCARO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are 169 catalogs in a box in my foyer and
another 43 in the standing rack in my bathroom. There are still
more mixed in with the hundreds of magazines and newspapers stacked
3 feet high in my living room and bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   We do not call my apartment Collier's Condo for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   They've been arriving at an average rate of four a day since
Oct. 13, when I received 11, threw them in the box with the six I'd
gotten the day before that, and started taking notes. I had always
gotten a lot of catalogs, but this was ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   The first batch included catalogs from San Francisco Music Box
and Gift Co.; Garnet Hill, which bills itself as the Original
Natural Fibers Catalog, and Levenger _ ``Tools for Serious
Readers.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly they have the wrong guy, I thought. I am scared of music
boxes, wear Performance Fleece for day exclusively, and the last
book I actually finished was one I had written, and that was
technically proofreading. But they kept coming. Even one called
Plow and Hearth: Products for Country Living, although I have
neither and my idea of country living is a Hickory Farms cheese
log.
</P>
<P>
   Catalogs like these were supposed to be the answer to our
holiday shopping needs. But they turned out to be the paper
equivalent of shops I call close-but-no-cigar stores, where
everything is sort of nice but you don't really want to buy
anything. As it turns out, the most useful catalog I received this
season was from Eddie Bauer Home. I rolled it up and used it to
kill a water bug the size of a Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
   Now I wonder if e-commerce will be any more useful in the long
run. Right now, of course, it's all anyone is talking about. Like
so many other people this holiday season, I spent money on the
Internet. I sent out-of-state chums books from amazon.com. Using a
Web search service that led me to an Oregon bookstore, I found
leftover copies of an out-of-print 1995 book about food fads that I
adore.
</P>
<P>
   I bought black chinos in my size from gap.com. I ordered cookie
cutters from a Web site I read about in Family Circle in my
dentist's waiting room. When no one at the F.A.O. Schwarz stores in
Manhattan and Short Hills, N.J., could find me ``At Home for the
Holidays'' _ a new limited edition magenta-and-lavender hostess
outfit for my Gene doll _ I ordered one from a collectibles
superstore. And I got a 10 percent discount for ordering online.
</P>
<P>
   It arrived from Monroe, Mich., four days later.
</P>
<P>
   With speed and value like that _ not to mention not having to
ask a teen-ager for pants in my waist size _ Internet companies are
making good on the promise that catalogs once held. Like their
paper predecessors, they are geared toward the so-called cash-rich,
time-poor professional. They're re-introducing courtesy back into
the retail experience. Now you click, you type, they wrap, they
send, and then you get a little note saying it's all been taken
care of. That's all any of us want from retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Try getting that from a human being, however. Lately, every time
I speak to a salesperson or catalog operator, I understand the need
for rage management clinics. At a tiny Flatiron district store
specializing in tabletop items, bric-a-brac and novelties, I paid
for my items and asked the clerk to wrap them up. He handed me
colored tissue paper and said I had to wrap them myself, even
though I was on my way to the party at which they were to be
bestowed. I thought, of course, why would you wrap these presents
for your customers? You're only a gift store!
</P>
<P>
   This frustration is all too common nowadays. In a time of
prosperity, when retailers don't have to scramble for your buck,
most of us feel stranded by sales help.
</P>
<P>
   In leaner times, as recently as the early 1990s, service was
being pushed as the top priority of retailers everywhere. Sales
clerks would do a lot for you. Today you can forget that at all but
the toniest retailers.
</P>
<P>
   At any store approaching the mainstream pocketbook, no one seems
to know the answer to anything. An exception: At Restoration
Hardware recently, I asked, ``How many rings does a shower curtain
need?'' Two salesgirls answered ``Twelve!'' in unison. I could have
kissed them both.
</P>
<P>
   In my shopping travels, this is by far the exception. Most of us
have been trained to avoid sales help, whether it's at the
supermarket or a trendy boutique. We know we're not going to get
the help we need, so why disrupt their conversation. This lack of
service is the chief reason we're being drawn into cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The pleasure of Internet shopping is not just the smoothness of
the transaction or the vast selection. It's the joy of buying
something without having to talk to a woman whose nail tips are
longer than her attention span or a man whose disposition is about
as steely as his abs.
</P>
<P>
   Now only cyberretailers remember your tastes, sending you an
e-mail that says, ``If you bought the Elvis Costello-Burt Bachrach
CD, you might like this jazz reinterpretation from Bill Frisell.''
</P>
<P>
   Retailers have proven they can build beautiful stores _ the new
Terrance Conran Shop at 59th Street and First Avenue beneath the
Queensboro Bridge, for instance, is exquisite. Now if they could
just fill them with sales help who are equally impressive, people
who know the merchandise better than the best shoppers do, we could
all be happy. When they do, I'll throw out my catalogs and put down
my mouse, but not a minute before.

   One of the Holy Grails of personal computing has long been voice
recognition. Its proponents believe that it's better to talk to
your computer than use that ancient instrument of torture known as
the keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   For the last few years, the companies that make software that
can control a PC and turn words into text have said that it is
finally ready for prime time, that it's good enough for everyday
people to use comfortably. Come and get it!
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it wasn't true then. And, it's almost not true
now.
</P>
<P>
   I've been looking at each of the new voice-recognition releases
over the last two years, but haven't found anything worth writing
about. These earlier versions took too long to train to recognize
an individual's voice and speech, and once they did, their
recognition success rates were unacceptably low.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, with each new version, these programs have gotten
better. And, the latest are the best so far, but it's largely
thanks to a pair of advances in hardware.
</P>
<P>
   The first is a set of new multimedia-enhancing code found in
Intel Corp.'s Pentium III chips, as well as in Advanced Micro
Devices' Athlon processors. This code can be used to boost the
ability of the software to hear and translate words into text more
accurately.
</P>
<P>
   The second is the development of microphones that plug into a
Universal Serial Bus, or USB, port. These bypass a computer's
traditional sound card, which takes two large variables out of the
voice-recognition equation _ card and microphone quality. Using a
USB microphone greatly increases the accuracy of what the computer
hears.
</P>
<P>
   I've been looking at two voice recognition programs, both of
which work with a USB microphone _ Dragon Systems Naturally- &QL; 
Speaking Preferred 4.0 and Lernout &AMP; Hauspie's VoiceXpress
Professional 4.0. They were tested on a computer that has a
500-megahertz Pentium III chip. While both are much better than
what was offered just two years ago, I still found them frustrating
to use. However, they're now good enough that those with
disabilities or who are seriously keyboard-phobic can use them for
everyday tasks.
</P>
<P>
   And, in case you're wondering, no, I didn't write this review
using the software. It would have driven me nuts.
</P>
<P>
   _ NaturallySpeaking Preferred USB 4.0, $249, Dragon Systems. Of
the two systems I tried, NaturallySpeaking had the best voice
recognition accuracy, but was not as good at maneuvering around
Windows 98 as I would have liked.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you are a WordPerfect user, you'll definitely want
to select this title, because it meshes so well with that word
processor. In fact, one version of the WordPerfect Office 2000
suite comes with an integrated version of NaturallySpeaking.
</P>
<P>
   As with all voice recognition products, you must spend time
training the program to recognize your voice. NaturallySpeaking has
you select a passage to read from several sources _ I chose a
chapter from Arthur C. Clarke's novel ``2001: A Space Odyssey,''
which seemed fitting _ and the computer listens while you read.
</P>
<P>
   You can go through as many training sessions as you like, each
taking about 15 minutes, but Dragon claims decent accuracy with
just one session for those who have a clear, unaccented voice.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, I was able to do fairly well, achieving about 95 percent
accuracy when I read from a document. When I just dictated off the
top of my head, though, accuracy dropped way off. I found I was
distracted by watching the process of the computer converting words
to text, and it threw off my natural rhythm of speech. Since I
trained the computer by reading to it, it was confused by the
different speech pattern.
</P>
<P>
   NaturallySpeaking also was best at using voice to correct
mistakes. Both programs bring up a text box that lets you alter
mistranslated words, and with this program I seldom had to resort
to typing in the correct letters.
</P>
<P>
   However, I found it clunky using this software to control
Windows applications. For example, inserting Web addresses into
Internet Explorer was very frustrating, as was choosing which
e-mail to open and read in Eudora Pro.
</P>
<P>
   This version comes with a headset USB microphone, which is why
it costs as much as it does. If you buy the USB microphone
separately, you can get the software for about $200.
</P>
<P>
   _ VoiceXpress Professional 4, $150, Lernout &AMP; Hauspie: Although
it doesn't say so on the box, VoiceXpress professional will work
with a USB microphone _ and a coupon for a Telex model is inside.
It comes with a basic headset microphone, but it's worth spending
the $60 for a USB version.
</P>
<P>
   VoiceXpress' package claims it can go through its training
process _ which L&AMP;H calls ``enrollment'' _ in about 12 minutes.
However, that's for reading a single passage, and I noticed at the
end of the session that it recommended I go through more enrollment
for better results, which in effect doubled the training time.
</P>
<P>
   VoiceXpress was not quite as accurate as NaturallySpeaking. I
topped out at about 90 percent accuracy when reading text, and
accuracy in simple dictation dropped off. I also found it was
harder to correct using my voice _ I frequently had to resort to
typing corrections. Even trying to spell the word verbally resulted
in errors.
</P>
<P>
   However, VoiceXpress was better at navigating Windows. It also
comes with the ability to create voice-based macros _ a series of
commands you can execute with a single word. For example, if you
have a favorite Web site, you can have VoiceXpress launch your
browser and go directly there just by saying its name.
</P>
<P>
   VoiceXpress comes with a series of small applications called
TalkingTools designed specifically to work using voice commands,
including a notepad, calculator, an address book and a time-zone
clock. There's even something called the Web Finder, which lets you
ask a question that's then sent to a Web search engine.

OOPS! INTEL CELERON CACHE WAS OVERSTATED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: In your Dec. 3 story on specifications for shopping for a new
computer you mentioned that buyers should look for a microprocessor
that has at least 256 kilobytes of cache. But then you also
recommended Intel's Celeron processor for some buyers, and it only
has 128 kb of cache. Does this mean you advise against a Celeron
because it only has 128?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oops! Mea culpa. I blew it.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to juggle the various kinds of chips that are out
there _ and users really do have quite a choice _ I got some
specifications crossed.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Celerons have 128 kb of cache, and that's fine for the kind
of users in the first two categories _ novice and basic
home/business users. The Celeron is an excellent bargain _
essentially a Pentium II with less cache. Most users will not
notice the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There's a text file on my computer that I would like to
change, but I am not allowed to change it. When I try, I get told
that this is a ``read-only'' file. What can I do to change it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The way a file is stored on your hard drive is known as its
``attributes.'' A read-only file is one that you can't write to
and, in some cases, you may not be able to delete it.
</P>
<P>
   In bad old MS-DOS days, you had to issue an arcane string of
characters in your command line to change a file's attributes. But
with Windows 95/98, you can do it with the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Find the file you want to change and right-click on it. Choose
``Properties'' from the menu that appears.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom of the resulting box, you'll see a series of check
boxes, and one of them will be Read-Only. Uncheck it to be able to
change the file.
</P>
<P>
   You also can change the attributes of all the files in a folder.
Right-click on a folder and choose Properties. If all the files in
the folder are read-only, you'll see the plain,
black-check-on-white-background checkbox you saw in the single
file. But if only some are read-only, the background in the box
will be gray. Click on it until the box is cleared.
</P>
<P>
   What are some of the other checkboxes you see there? The
``Archive'' box allows programs such as backup software to grab
files that are frequently changed. ``Hidden'' is self-explanatory _
it will hide files when you open the folder, but only if your
Folder Options are set up to hide hidden files. ``System'' is to
indicate a file is an important part of the operating system _
don't mess with it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I updated the video drivers for the first time on a new
computer. I watched the process and could see the installer put the
drivers in the windowssystem folder. But when I look in my AOL
download folder, I see the drivers are in there! Are they in both
places? Do I need to leave them or can I delete them?
</P>
<P>
   A: When you download an update package like this, it's often
comprised of a cluster of files that first must be unpacked, then
installed. What you're seeing in the AOL download folder are the
unpacked files.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, a well-written install program will clean up after
itself and delete the files it unpacked. Not all do this. In fact,
some packages merely unpack the files, then leave it to you to
start the installation routine by finding and clicking on a Setup
program.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have the files installed, you should be able to delete
them. Be sure to inspect any instruction or ``read-me'' files
before you do.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have been told to use Windows Update to keep Windows 98
files up to date, but I keep getting a message wanting me to
approve downloading something from Microsoft before I continue.
What is this?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a component that automates the process of seeing what's
already installed as part of Windows 98, downloading the patch and
installing it. Don't worry, it's a good thing. Without it, you have
to download these patches and install them manually.

 &HT;    TEEN DRUG USE LEVELING OFF, ANNUAL STUDY SHOWS
 &HT;    BY SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An annual study shows that illicit drug use among
the nation's teens is leveling off, health officials said Friday,
though use of steroids and the drug ``ecstasy'' is climbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's report confirms that we have halted the dangerous
trend of increased drug use among our young people,'' said Donna
Shalala, secretary of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   For the 25th straight year, the University of Michigan asked
more than 45,000 eighth-, 10th- and 12th-grade students across the
country about whether they used drugs and alcohol each day, over
the past year, or in their lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that for a third year in a row, reported use of
drugs such as marijuana, amphetamines, hallucinogens,
tranquilizers, and heroin has changed little or not at all.
</P>
<P>
   It found that use of crack cocaine dropped 14 percent among
eighth-graders and 27 percent among 10th-graders.
</P>
<P>
   One in four 12th-graders, one in five 10th-graders, and nearly
one in eight eighth-graders reported using an illicit drug in the
past 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Barry McCaffrey, President Clinton's drug policy director,
said that while the nation has made some progress in its campaign
against drugs, usage levels remain higher than at the beginning of
the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol use among teens also remained stable compared with last
year's figures. In 1999, about one in 11 eighth-graders, one in
five 10th-graders and one in three 12th-graders reported being
drunk during the past month.
</P>
<P>
   ``One note of alarm,'' said McCaffrey, ``is the rise in the use
of steroids among youth.'' Past-month steroid use among
10th-graders increased almost 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   More young people believe steroids are safe, McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Johnston, the primary researcher for the Michigan survey,
suggested that baseball home run champion Mark McGwire's use of a
steroid _ which he has since discontinued _ may have affected
notions about steroids among young boys. But McCaffrey and Shalala
said there was no evidence in the study linking McGwire's
activities with the increased steroid usage.
</P>
<P>
   The study also showed a rise in the use of ``ecstasy,'' a
stimulant commonly used at dance clubs across the country. The
survey found that its past-year use increased among 10th-graders
from 3.3 percent to 4.4 percent, and among 12th-graders from 3.6
percent to 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the use of this drug has been declining since we first
measured it in 1996, for some reason it made a resurgence in
1999,'' Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institute on Drug Abuse plans to increase its
budget for research on ecstasy and other ``club drugs `` by 40
percent, Shalala said. The organization has also launched an
Internet site (www.clubdrugs.com) to answer teens' questions about
ecstasy and other club drugs.

SOME GO TO WORK BY STAYING HOME 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM BARLOW 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Would you like to go to work without going to work?
</P>
<P>
   Currently, more than 21 million Americans do just that, although
some only part time.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking telecommuting. Using the telephone and a personal
computer to work from home.
</P>
<P>
   That 21 million number is up from just 4 million in 1990. The
best guess is that 51 million telecommuters will be out there in
2030.
</P>
<P>
   The figures are from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
However, keep in mind they include everyone who does some work from
home every week, not just full-timers.
</P>
<P>
   Another estimate, from the American Internet User Survey, said
the number of corporate employees who spent at least part of their
time working from home increased from 10.5 million in 1997 to 11.4
million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A third study, by International Data Corp. said currently 23.8
million home offices are used by telecommuters and entrepreneurs,
up from 8.7 million in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the exact figures, all the surveys agree that
telecommuting is growing. A recent survey by the Society of Human
Resource management found that 28 percent of companies are now
letting their employees telecommute, up from 19.5 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ABSENTEEISM CUT IN HALF &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's driving the growth?
</P>
<P>
   _ First there's the plunging cost of equipping home offices. In
1984, the kind of computer needed for business cost $3,995. In
1997, that was down to $999. That's an 83 percent drop in 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   Or look at cellular phones. When first introduced in 1984, they
had a retail price of between $3,995 and $4,395. Today, you can
pick one up for $120. And it's digital, giving much better service
than the old analog phones.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the number of mobile phone subscribers grew from 11
million worldwide in 1990 to nearly 400 million today.
</P>
<P>
   _ Second is the fact telecommuting is good business. It reduces
absenteeism and improves productivity, says Krishna Kundu of the
Employment Policy Foundation in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Studies by the Gartner Group, a global information technology
consultant, found telecommuting improves productivity by 10 to 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Productivity gains come primarily from two areas. Telecommuters
have more energy. On average, Americans take 22 minutes to
physically commute to work each day. If you are working from home,
you don't have that energy-sapping drive.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommuters also face fewer distractions. The person at the
next desk isn't going to be telling your about his vacation or
showing you the latest pictures of the grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   Having the opportunity to work at home cuts absenteeism in half,
according to a study by the International Telework Council
Association &AMP; Council in October of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that telecommuters could spend a couple of hours
taking care of a family emergency, which would normally keep them
out of the office, than use a home office to get the work done.
</P>
<P>
   _ Third, there's the fact that telecommuting helps business to
hold on to good employees.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 Wirthlin Worldwide Survey found that 78 percent of
telecommuters described themselves as ``very committed'' to their
company, vs. only 53 percent of those who went to the office each
day.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THERE ARE SOME DOWNSIDES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not every job is suitable to telecommuting. It's most
often used for knowledge workers who use a computer to do their
work.
</P>
<P>
   One downside for the company is the lack of face-to-face
meetings with all employees to keep everyone working together.
Companies that successfully use telecommuting find their managers
have to spend additional time on the phone or talking by e-mail
with those who work at home.
</P>
<P>
   You also lose interaction between employees _ those informal
contacts where conversation leads to problem solving.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of speculation that telecommuting will wind up
solving traffic congestion and air pollution problems by
eliminating most commuting.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Burgess, president of the Denver-based Center for the New
West, says it won't.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is growing evidence that teleworkers travel more than
those who commute,'' he says. They go shopping, take their kids to
soccer practice and take more-frequent, but shorter vacations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Travel is here to stay,'' Burgess believes.

&HT;     TEXAS MOVES TO EASE STATE BORDER INSPECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By PEGGY FIKAC  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With an eye on traffic congestion at
international crossings, the Texas Transportation Commission has
approved the development of eight centralized state inspection
stations at five cities on the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``The growth of commercial truck traffic along the border points
to the need to build these state inspection stations sooner rather
than later,'' commission Chairman David Laney said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But state Sen. Eliot Shapleigh, author of a state law calling
for one-stop state and federal border inspections, voiced
skepticism about the state's move without including federal
agencies, what he called a ``two-stop shop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope someone at TxDOT (the Texas Department of
Transportation) can explain to us on the border how this makes
border commerce more efficient. In Europe, that truck on the
Autobahn barely stops between France and Germany. Are we heading in
the right direction in Texas when we build into the system
essentially two stops?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shapleigh, D-El Paso, said state policy must reduce crossing
times and separate commercial functions from enforcement of drug
and immigration laws.
</P>
<P>
   Laney said the commission supports the one-stop goal but does
not want to wait for the federal government to make a move.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure to act is heightened by the possibility that the border
could be opened wide to Mexican truck traffic under provisions of
the North American Free Trade Agreement, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be caught flat-footed,'' he said. ``This
leaves us total flexibility to move to one-stop or two-stop, but it
keeps the thing on track and moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's action authorizes environmental studies, route and
design plans, public involvement, field surveying and acquisition
of rights-of-way. The cost of rights-of-way acquisition is
estimated at $8.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Additional commission action would be needed to start
construction, which could begin as early as 2001. Construction
costs are estimated at $76.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The state stations are to be near international bridges in
Brownsville (Los Tomates and Los Indios), Eagle Pass (Bridge II),
El Paso (Bridge of the Americas and Ysleta-Zaragoza), Laredo
(Bridge IV and Colombia-Solidarity) and Pharr (Pharr-Reynosa).
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the secretary of state's office and Texas
Department of Public Safety said the stations would allow for
faster inspection of a greater number of trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The facilities also would allow for the Texas Natural Resource
Conservation Commission to check for hazardous waste, the Texas
Department of Agriculture to monitor agricultural products, and the
comptroller's office to check fuel permits.

 &HT;    EARLY SIGNS POINT TO BREAKOUT YEAR FOR E-COMMERCE
 &HT;    680&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Saturday is likely to be the biggest day in retail
history, with millions of Christmas shoppers spending record
amounts everywhere from small shops on Main Street to glitzy stores
in malls.
</P>
<P>
   But for most online merchants, who typically need a few days to
pick, pack and ship goods, the sales peak passed earlier this week.
Now the cyber-companies must prove they can deliver boxes in the
real world by Dec. 24.
</P>
<P>
   And it appears there are plenty of packages to move.
</P>
<P>
   Based on conversations with electronic merchants, ``we expect
sales to exceed our estimate of $8 billion,'' said Evie Black
Dykema, an e-commerce analyst for Forrester Research Inc., based in
Cambridge, Mass. Last year, holiday sales amounted to $3.5 billion
for online companies, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some extremely optimistic analysts believe sales may even reach
$18 billion. Dykema said accurate figures will not be available
until well into January, when companies finish adding up sales and
subtracting returned merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   But odds are good that online sales soared, considering the
near-jubilant mood of consumers. This fall, the National Retail
Federation, a trade group, had predicted overall holiday sales
would rise about 6 percent from last year. But consumer confidence
is so high that an increase of 7 percent may be more likely,
exceeding projected sales of $183 billion.
</P>
<P>
   While conventional wisdom holds that the Friday after
Thanksgiving is the busiest shopping day of the year, retailers
have found that the Saturday before Christmas is the real whopper.
With the weather expected to be calm over most of the country,
merchants hope to smash one-day sales records.
</P>
<P>
   Those consumers who still want to shop on line do have options,
but not as many as a week ago. ``The fact is, many products are
running out,'' Dykema said, which means e-merchants won't have time
to restock and deliver by Dec. 24. In addition, getting a gift
delivered by Christmas Eve is now likely to require the use of more
expensive express services, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone in cyberspace is closing down the holiday
season yet. For example, America Online, based in suburban
Washington, has compiled a ``Last Minute Gifts'' catalog that
allows procrastinators to choose items guaranteed for pre-Christmas
delivery. Others, such as Toysmart.com, in Waltham, Mass., are
allowing customers to order without any extra delivery charges
until Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gifts ordered by then will be under the tree Christmas morning,
``barring any acts of God or snowstorms in New England,'' said
company spokesman Paul Rafter.
</P>
<P>
   To allow customers to order so late, Toysmart.com must keep
warehouse staffing levels high. Chris Larivee, a 25-year-old gift
wrapper, said the packing frenzy has workers almost giddy. ``It's
definitely a fun environment,'' he said. ``We're working two shifts
now, with up to 20 wrappers'' per shift.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies have started moving their marketing focus to
electronic gift certificates, which can be ordered and delivered
via e-mail, even on Christmas morning.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to make Dec. 25 deadlines will be immense because
of the ferocious competition in cyberspace, according to Irwin
Barkan, chairman of e-Buyersguide.com, an online research firm in
Burlington, Mass. Young companies cannot afford to infuriate
customers. ``If the gift is not there by Wednesday, people are
going to flip out'' and take their business elsewhere next year, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the winnowing has begun. Barkan said about 70 percent
of all online shoppers did business through the top 25 sites. Most
of the problems that consumers reported this December, such as Web
site slowdowns, server errors and delivery failures, involved the
smaller, less experienced companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those underperforming companies may not get a second chance next
year. ``There will definitely be a shakeout'' in early 2000,
analyst Dykema said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This year has been a free-for-all,'' with companies spending
vast sums on advertising to attract companies, she said. In
January, accountants will determine whether that spending resulted
in respectable sales. If not, companies will disappear quickly,
leaving only those with strong reputations and brand recognition.
As the herd of e-retailers thins, ``there will be more structure in
the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the number of online merchants may shrink next year,
spending is likely to grow sharply. That's because millions of
Americans are still learning about computer-based shopping, AOL
spokeswoman Julie Mason said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week, 6 million consumers made a purchase for the
first time through AOL, she said. That's more than double the 2.4
million first-time shoppers that AOL attracted during the
comparable week of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more people are shopping online'' with each passing
year, she said. As the ranks of competitors shrink, overall service
may improve. ``The thing that differentiate the winners from the
losers will be service,'' she said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tom Crutchfield stands, on a hectic pre-Christmas
Friday afternoon, as he has for most of the last 15 years, on the
Bloomingdale's main floor. Today he's saying, ``Ferragamo?
Ferragamo?'' to passersby. Two years ago it was, ``Tiffany?
Tiffany?'' And before that, ``Giorgio Beverly Hills?''
</P>
<P>
   Formerly a cruise director, Crutchfield, 49, is bemused, rather
than annoyed, by the throbbing dance music coming from the nearby
MAC counter. He doesn't mind that a dancer in a midriff-bearing top
and a micro-miniskirt is distracting potential customers.
</P>
<P>
   And after a decade and a half of this, he is accustomed to the
throngs of stony-faced consumers who don't bother to look up at him
as they fight their way to the center of the store.
</P>
<P>
   He stands, focused and calm and, yes, happy, in his official
black Bloomingdale's blazer, bottle and blotter cards in hand,
repeating his mantra: ``Ferragamo? Ferragamo?''
</P>
<P>
   When customers stop, it's more often to ask, ``Where are the
pants?'' or ``Where's the exit?'' than, ``Does it come with a
gift?'' With the patience of a man used to constant rejection, he
offers directions and then, again, asks, ``Would you care to try
...'' More often than not, they don't.
</P>
<P>
   Crutchfield estimates that of the 400 people he may speak to on
a given day, only a dozen or so will actually buy.
</P>
<P>
   There are other ways of selling perfume. This has, after all,
been called the first big e-Christmas, and Sephora, the
trend-setting French beauty store, where perfumes are arranged
alphabetically for customers to sample on their own, has just
opened its U.S. flagship with much fanfare in Rockefeller Center.
</P>
<P>
   The success of either or both of these retail channels could
eventually mean an end to spritzers like Crutchfield. Are he and
his kind part of a doomed breed?
</P>
<P>
   During these peak preholiday days, there are some 150 spritzers
working the main floor of Bloomingdale's. Finely tuned recording
equipment could separate out more than 100 brand names being
chanted over the din of shoppers streaming in from Lexington Avenue
and 59th Street _ Shalimar, CK, Givenchy, DKNY, Angel. There are 30
more spritzers working heavy traffic areas throughout the store's
nine selling floors _ Bulgari, Contradiction, Emporio, Cartier.
</P>
<P>
   But just blocks away, at Sephora, there are no spritzers, no
ladies in lab coats. ``It's an easy selling environment,'' said
Betsy Olum, the vice president for marketing at Sephora. ``It's not
aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   It may not be aggressive, but spritzers and department stores
are finding it to be the scariest development in beauty retailing
to come along in years. Sephora is ``going to give the department
stores a real battle for the young consumer,'' said Laurie Palma,
the vice president for fragrance marketing at Chanel.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year there will be 50 Sephora stores
throughout the country. Eventually there will be some 200 in urban
centers and suburban malls, all priding themselves on a hands-off
policy that frees customers from high-pressure sales.
</P>
<P>
   And for customers who really can't stand human interaction,
there's yet another option: the Internet. New beauty sites are
emerging nearly as quickly as new fragrances: Beauty.com, Eve.com,
Beautyjungle.com., Toofaced.com. The most recent cosmetics survey
by the NPD Group, a market researcher company, found that less than
1 percent of beauty sales were made online, but that was back in
June. Like makers of almost every kind of consumer product, perfume
marketers are watching the Internet closely.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than predict the demise of spritzers, cosmetics
companies insist that they are what will help department stores
hold their own against self-service upstarts like Sephora or the
Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a customer is really in a rush, they'll probably buy
online,'' Ms. Palma said. ``If they're in a store, they want the
show. They'll be more receptive to service, because that's what
they want. That's what they're there for.''
</P>
<P>
   Camille McDonald, the president of Givenchy Perfumes, said
because her company does not have the marketing budget of, say, a
Calvin Klein, it puts more emphasis than most on spritzers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``As stores strip counter space and salespeople, the only
informed service is provided by our ladies,'' she said. ``We will
never abandon them as our No. 1 spend.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one has yet figured out how to give an online
customer a sample spritz of a perfume. One site, Gloss.com, is
attempting to overcome this barrier through heavy doses of
product-sample mailings and an online quiz that asks customers to
identify their favorite fruit and favorite season as a means to
pinpoint fragrances that they might like.
</P>
<P>
   Deanna Kangas, a founder of Gloss.com, acknowledges that even
though shoppers frequently grouse about ambush spritzing, the
technique is successful. ``When you walk up and spray someone, it's
offensive,'' she said, ``but you do get bigger sales numbers with
consultants.''
</P>
<P>
   Crutchfield isn't really worried: ``A lot of the things you can
get at Bloomingdale's, you can get at other stores. What is going
to make the difference is the way we treat our guests,'' he said of
his customers. Ten days after he makes a sale, he calls his
customers to see ``how the fragrance is working,'' he said. Thirty
days, he calls again. Just to check in.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety days, another call _ this one asking if there's anything
else they need. ``I have people who have been shopping with me for
15 years,'' Crutchfield said. And, as if on cue, one of his
longtime customers appeared to get his opinion about which tie she
should buy for her dentist. She took the blue one _ and a $75
Tiffany gift set he was offering.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Crutchfield nor most of the other perfume sales
representatives at Bloomingdale's actually work for the store, even
though they all wear Bloomingdale name tags. Not the ones spritzing
customers, not the ones ringing up sales, not the ones giving
directions to confused shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomingdale's requires that each cosmetic company staff its own
counter and pay for its own displays. Crutchfield, for instance,
works for Fragrances Exclusive Inc., a division of Chanel that
distributes Ferragamo, Bulgari and Tiffany perfumes. He is the
manager for the Ferragamo brand, and as such he selects the scores
of free-lancers who make $15 to $18 an hour spritzing from the FEI
``outposts'' throughout the store _ plus bonus incentives, often in
cash.
</P>
<P>
   What does it take to be a successful spritzer? Aside from good
aim and a high tolerance for (per)fumes, the most valuable asset is
simply an ability to put others at ease. Aminata Ndiaye, currently
stationed outside the Ralph Lauren boutique, started working at
Bloomingdale's 10 years ago to earn money for graduate school. Put
in the basement and told to sell $300 her first day, Ms. Ndiaye
cleared four times that amount and became a store legend.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for the secret of her success, Ms. Ndiaye, 35, said, ``A
lot of people in New York, they need someone to talk to.'' Early
last week, she recalled, a customer stopped outside her station and
declared: ``It's Hanukkah, and I don't have any presents, and my
husband is going to ditch me if I come home without gifts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in Bloomingdale's,'' Ms. Ndiaye said she replied.
``There's plenty to choose from.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ndiaye and the customer left the sales floor to have a
cigarette together, and Ms. Ndiaye heard all about the woman's
husband and children. When the customer came back to Ms. Ndiaye's
station, she spent $1,500 on perfumes for her family.
</P>
<P>
   Try making that sale on the Internet.

 &HT;    EARLY SIGNS POINT TO BREAKOUT YEAR FOR E-COMMERCE
 &HT;    680&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Saturday is likely to be the biggest day in retail
history, with millions of Christmas shoppers spending record
amounts everywhere from small shops on Main Street to glitzy stores
in malls.
</P>
<P>
   But for most online merchants, who typically need a few days to
pick, pack and ship goods, the sales peak passed earlier this week.
Now the cyber-companies must prove they can deliver boxes in the
real world by Dec. 24.
</P>
<P>
   And it appears there are plenty of packages to move.
</P>
<P>
   Based on conversations with electronic merchants, ``we expect
sales to exceed our estimate of $8 billion,'' said Evie Black
Dykema, an e-commerce analyst for Forrester Research Inc., based in
Cambridge, Mass. Last year, holiday sales amounted to $3.5 billion
for online companies, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some extremely optimistic analysts believe sales may even reach
$18 billion. Dykema said accurate figures will not be available
until well into January, when companies finish adding up sales and
subtracting returned merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   But odds are good that online sales soared, considering the
near-jubilant mood of consumers. This fall, the National Retail
Federation, a trade group, had predicted overall holiday sales
would rise about 6 percent from last year. But consumer confidence
is so high that an increase of 7 percent may be more likely,
exceeding projected sales of $183 billion.
</P>
<P>
   While conventional wisdom holds that the Friday after
Thanksgiving is the busiest shopping day of the year, retailers
have found that the Saturday before Christmas is the real whopper.
With the weather expected to be calm over most of the country,
merchants hope to smash one-day sales records.
</P>
<P>
   Those consumers who still want to shop on line do have options,
but not as many as a week ago. ``The fact is, many products are
running out,'' Dykema said, which means e-merchants won't have time
to restock and deliver by Dec. 24. In addition, getting a gift
delivered by Christmas Eve is now likely to require the use of more
expensive express services, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone in cyberspace is closing down the holiday
season yet. For example, America Online, based in suburban
Washington, has compiled a ``Last Minute Gifts'' catalog that
allows procrastinators to choose items guaranteed for pre-Christmas
delivery. Others, such as Toysmart.com, in Waltham, Mass., are
allowing customers to order without any extra delivery charges
until Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gifts ordered by then will be under the tree Christmas morning,
``barring any acts of God or snowstorms in New England,'' said
company spokesman Paul Rafter.
</P>
<P>
   To allow customers to order so late, Toysmart.com must keep
warehouse staffing levels high. Chris Larivee, a 25-year-old gift
wrapper, said the packing frenzy has workers almost giddy. ``It's
definitely a fun environment,'' he said. ``We're working two shifts
now, with up to 20 wrappers'' per shift.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies have started moving their marketing focus to
electronic gift certificates, which can be ordered and delivered

   Presents wrapped? Check. Holiday cards sent out? Check.
Waistline reduced to fit into dress for New Year's Eve? Oops.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry, it's not too late. At least, so say some New York
plastic surgeons, who report that they are working double time this
month to help patients look their millennium best.
</P>
<P>
   Surgeons are getting desperate phone calls like the one Dr.
Lloyd Hoffman, a chief of plastic surgery at New York Presbyterian
Hospital, received the other day from a woman, 35, who suddenly
realized she couldn't squeeze into the ball gown she planned to
wear to a New Year's Eve party.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wanted her abdomen suctioned to fit the tight waistline,''
said Hoffman, who has scheduled the procedure for this week.
</P>
<P>
   Another patient, 24, actually brought a dark red dress with a
drop waist and a flare skirt to Dr. Helen Colen's Park Avenue
office. Why? To show the doctor where it didn't fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had to have the liposuction done in her hips immediately
because she HAD to wear that dress on New Year's Eve,'' said Dr.
Colen, who performed the work last week.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that you could roll a bowling ball through the
surgical suites of plastic surgeons in December without hitting a
soul. But on the eve of the millennium, thanks to a new generation
of quick procedures, new treatments that speed healing and patients
who want to jump-start their New Year's resolutions, doctors in New
York say they are heavily booked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one woman who pleaded with me to have surgery on Sunday,
so she could look her best for the New Year,'' said Dr. Carroll
Lesesne, a plastic surgeon in private practice, who was looking
drowsy at a Park Avenue holiday party last Monday, after working
many hours the day before. He had performed a facelift, eyelid work
and a nose-tip modification on the woman. While he would not reveal
the price, other than to say it was ``somewhere over $15,000'' he
related that his patient was so eager that she promised to make it
well worth his efforts. ``She did,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dolores Laun, a data-entry clerk from the Bronx, who was waiting
in Dr. Thomas Romo's office on Fifth Avenue last Thursday, said her
decision to have plastic surgery was ``spur of the moment.'' She
said: ``I wanted to look great for the year 2000. I have a lot of
friends, and I like to go out, and I'm having a big party New
Year's Eve.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Laun, 52, who works part-time in Romo's office, had an
endoscopic brow lift (a procedure done through small incisions in
the scalp), fat pads removed from her lower eyelids and a chin
implant. While the first two procedures took two weeks to heal, the
latter, performed in November, took three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look like I'm 35,'' Ms. Laun said. ``I'm ready for the
millenium.'' The cost to be ready: $12,000, part of which she is
working off in the doctor's office.
</P>
<P>
   No figures exist for plastic surgery performed each month, but
in recent years quick fixes like Botox injections and minor
liposuction have become the most popular cosmetic procedures
nationwide. In 1998, chemical peels of the face were the most oft
performed procedure, followed by collagen injections, with
liposuction No. 4 and Botox No. 6, according to the American
Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Fritz Barton, the society's president, understands the rush
for year-end self-improvement. ``People become more
appearance-conscious when they have important events occurring,''
he said. ``It's part of getting prepared to look good in a
particular time in your life. Just like wanting something new to
wear.''
</P>
<P>
   But he cautioned against impulsiveness and unrealistic
expectations. ``You can't just do a procedure the day before and
look great the next day,'' he said. ``Most procedures need at least
two weeks to heal and sometimes three or four.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some patients clearly have come to view a visit to the
plastic surgeon as similar to an appointment with the hairdresser,
and some doctors seem to encourage them. ``You can walk in the
door, have Botox injections all over your face, have your driver
waiting and be on the plane in an hour,'' said Dr. Alan Matarasso,
a Park Avenue plastic surgeon, adding that he has never been busier
in the month of December before. In addition to Botox and collagen
injections _ so that wrinkles will not appear in holiday and
society-page pictures _ his patients are seeking quickie eyelid
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eyelids heal faster than any other procedure on the body,''
Matarasso said. ``You can have an operation on Thursday and maybe
with a little cover-up go out on a Saturday night.'' But Joan Kron,
who has been both a patient of cosmetic eye surgery and is the
author of ``Lift: Wanting, Fearing, and Having a Facelift''
(Viking, 1998), called Matarasso's time frame ``overly
optimistic.'' Sometimes, she said, the healing can take three to
four weeks. ``You can't always predict the bruising,'' Ms. Kron
said. ``Sometimes it's a function of your biology, the thickness or
thinness of your skin, whether you had an aspirin on that day.''
</P>
<P>
   For women with visions of low-cut dresses in their heads,
doctors reported that they are performing breast lifts
(repositioning the breast for a more youthful look) and
ever-popular breast implants. While a lift takes about one to two
weeks to heal, according to Matarasso, implants can allow a patient
to ``come in on Monday and by the weekend you won't be at the gym,
but you'll be going out.'' (That is, if you avoid painful
swelling).
</P>
<P>
   Some plastic surgeons are uneasy with people viewing surgery as
the answer to a fashion emergency. Dr. Bryan Forley, who is in
private practice on Fifth Avenue and is the resident plastic
surgeon at the new Soho Integrative Health Center, said he
discourages patients seeking liposuction just before a St. Bart's
vacation or a big night out.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than having plastic surgery to fit into a ball gown, he
said, he would encourage patients ``to make a New Year's resolution
that will help them to maintain the ability to fit into that ball
gown next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Wise advice, perhaps. But Ms. Kron said this year, in
particular, it is likely to be ignored. ``There'll be a lot of
people in dark glasses and tight girdles on New Year's Eve,'' she
said.

ELECTRONICS STORES CITED IN CRACKDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By EDWARD WONG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ City officials are moving to shut down two
electronics stores in midtown Manhattan and fine 15 others
throughout New York, accusing them of illegal business practices
like mispricing stock, overcharging credit cards and lying about
the quality of merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   The citations follow a six-month investigation in which consumer
affairs agents visited the stores posing as customers. The
investigation came after a long history of complaints from
customers, and particularly foreign tourists in the cases of
Photokina Limited and Audio Photo International, the two midtown
stores. Most of the other 15 shops are charged with selling
refurbished goods as new merchandise, a crime that has become a
major problem among electronics retailers, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many people, part of a tour of New York is taking
advantage of the fantastic shopping opportunities,'' said Jules
Polonetsky, the commissioner of the Department of Consumer Affairs.
``Unfortunately, these stores were turning the holiday shopping
experience to holiday horror for many visitors.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Audio Photo, for example, tourists from England,
Norway and Germany complained to the consumer affairs department
that they had been tricked into signing credit card receipts for
more than twice the agreed-upon prices. An Irish visitor complained
that he had been sold a video camera that did not work in his
country after being told the opposite. And a Belgian sightseer told
the agency that while buying a laptop computer and portable CD
player, he was charged about three times the manufacturer's
suggested retail price, which was never posted.
</P>
<P>
   New York electronics retailers are required by law to post the
suggested retail price for goods that are being sold for more than
that amount. Stores also must mark all electronics items with the
sale price, which some of the cited retailers failed to do,
Polonetsky said. In some cases, he added, stores charged customers
for accessories like batteries that manufacturers package free with
the merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Both Photokina and Audio Photo are threatened with losing their
licenses because of a long history of breaking consumer-protection
laws, officials said. Since 1991, both have been cited by the
Consumer Affairs Department for multiple violations. In 1997, the
agency fined Audio Photo more than $15,000 and Photokina more than
$7,000, and both signed agreements saying they would comply with
consumer laws.
</P>
<P>
   But since 1998, the department has received about 35 complaints
from tourists shopping at the two stores, officials said. The
stores, whose president is listed on license applications with the
department as Eli Zarif, are scheduled for a consumer-affairs
hearing on Jan. 24. They could have their licenses revoked and be
fined up to $75,000.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they would also seek to bar the store owners from
applying for future consumer licenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do this to us every year with no reason,'' said Richard
Zibi, an Audio Photo manager, referring to the charges. ``Listen,
you cannot please every customer. A few people get upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Zibi said the store had received eight customer complaints this
year and had responded to all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Photokina did not return calls asking for comment.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,500 electronics stores are licensed by the Department of
Consumer Affairs, which received about 800 complaints against
electronic retailers last year. The other 15 stores charged in the
investigation have been issued more than 400 violations. Last
month, Palace Electronics, a well-known Brooklyn retailer found
guilty of several violations, was forced to shut down.
</P>
<P>
   ``These stores give a very black eye to New York's shopping
reputation for many many tourists,'' Polonetsky said.

SPEAKING TO HEART OF MAN'S DISABILITY 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Most of us don't know what it's like to be disabled.
Jim Kollaer didn't either _ until he lost his voice after
undergoing heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   That would be bad enough for most of us, but Kollaer makes his
living by communicating. He is president and chief executive
officer of the Greater Houston Partnership, the city's biggest
business association, and as part of his job he negotiates,
persuades and lobbies. He is a leader, and leaders generally need
to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Kollaer had to listen from the sidelines as his
subordinates or volunteers from the board made presentations and
speeches for him.
</P>
<P>
   He no longer could interject comments or reroute the discussion
to a new direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``My talent is being able to think on my feet and communicate
those thoughts,'' Kollaer said recently over lunch. ``I couldn't
tell jokes, I couldn't make snide remarks, and it was hard to tell
someone you love them.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing that power to speak also caused Kollaer to lose some of
his power. He started getting left out of the loop when the only
way he could contribute was to listen, nod his head, wave his hand
or bang his fist on the table.
</P>
<P>
   A voice seems so matter-of-fact _ people just assume everyone
has one.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HEART SURGERY STARTS PROBLEM &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kollaer's voice problems began after he had a heart operation in
April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, he couldn't speak for three weeks, but his voice
returned and Kollaer chalked up the temporary loss to the swelling
of his vocal cords during the eight-hour operation.
</P>
<P>
   But seven months later, Kollaer lost his voice again when he
came down with a cold.
</P>
<P>
   And this time it didn't appear to be temporary.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that one of Kollaer's vocal cords was nicked
during the heart surgery and was no longer working.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a year, Kollaer couldn't talk above a whisper. And
there were periods when he couldn't speak at all.
</P>
<P>
   He did the best to cope by carrying around a child's Magna
Doodle with him to scribble notes and handing people cards that
explained he couldn't speak. But Kollaer wasn't ready for the
reactions he encountered.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes people whispered back, he said. Other times, people
assumed he couldn't hear so they'd shout at him.
</P>
<P>
   Or they just ignored him, assuming that if he couldn't speak, he
couldn't hear either. When Kollaer revealed to a car salesman that
he couldn't speak, the salesman spoke only to Kollaer's 15-year-old
son, Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   ``He acted like I wasn't even there,'' Kollaer said.
</P>
<P>
   It was also getting difficult to keep working as the head of the
Partnership. Board members never said anything directly. But when
you go to so many board meetings and you can't make the
presentation, you can feel it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The situation came to a head when Kollaer tried to eke out a
speech at a Houston luncheon in the fall and could hardly croak out
a few words.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Kollaer thought he could control it _ that if he
just got closer to the microphone, people could hear him. But after
the disastrous Houston 100 speech, Kollaer told his team that was
his last. He gave himself to the end of the year to get his voice
back.
</P>
<P>
   He also began to consider his life and what he had been missing.
Slowly, Kollaer uncovered a whole new side of himself and began to
take time to write in his journal, paint and go to art museums.
</P>
<P>
   He also started thinking about other career options that didn't
require a voice. He used to be in real estate, but that was out
because talking is too important in cutting deals. For a while he
considered returning to work as an architect.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe he could become a writer. ``I thought if Stephen
Hawking could find a way to communicate, I could too.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GOOD COMES FROM MISFORTUNE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before he got too far along in a career change, Kollaer got his
voice back. It returned as quickly as it disappeared when he woke
up Nov. 3 with the ability to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Medically, the explanation is that an ulcer on one of the vocal
cords finally cleared up and the working vocal cord picked up the
slack. Or it may be otherworldly.
</P>
<P>
   Kollaer has become more spiritural as a result of what happened.
</P>
<P>
   During lunch he pulled a card out of his pocket that said: ``I
found I had less and less to say until finally I became silent and
began to listen. I discovered in the silence the voice of God.''

ADDICTIVE, STATE-RUN VIDEO GAMBLING HAS HUGE SOCIAL COSTS

   &UR; By DAVID PLOTZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Americans who don't gamble tend to view gambling as either
high-glitz casinos or megabucks lotteries--the only outlets the
media ever bother to notice.
</P>
<P>
   This narrow focus has protected the gambling industry, since
Americans are willing to accept a vice that is clearly separated
from the rest of society--as casinos are--or that offers a luscious
chance at the good life--as megabucks lotteries do.
</P>
<P>
   But three nascent grassroots anti-gambling campaigns in the West
could finally bring attention to the real issue in American
gambling, which has nothing whatsoever to do with casinos or
multimillion-dollar jackpots.
</P>
<P>
   In Oregon and South Dakota, voters have gathered enough
signatures to place a constitutional amendment on the November 2000
ballot to outlaw ``video lottery.'' In Montana, activists are
preparing a similar November 2000 ballot measure to abolish video
gambling in that state.
</P>
<P>
   These initiatives aren't trying to eliminate all legal gambling
in their states--prohibition has been a disastrously unsuccessful
strategy in the gambling wars. Instead they are targeting only the
newest and most addictive form of American betting: ``convenience
gambling.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns against convenience gambling mark the most
important development in gambling politics in years.
</P>
<P>
   Convenience gambling--a cheerful phrase for an alarming idea--is
premised on the notion that once gambling is legal, it should be
allowed just about everywhere: convenience stores, bars,
restaurants, bowling alleys, gas stations. Eight states permit
convenience gambling now. In several, including South Dakota and
Oregon, convenience gambling takes the form of a so-called ``video
lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   To those who haven't played it, ``video lottery'' sounds like
some kind of high-tech Powerball--a lottery played with a computer
instead of a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``video lottery'' bears no relationship at all to a
lottery. It is simply a euphemism for state-run video poker
machines. Video poker is a popular casino game, a low-stakes
electronic version of five-card-draw poker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means minicasinos on Main Street that are run by the
government,'' says Tom Grey, head of the National Coalition Against
Legalized Gambling, which is organizing the three ballot
initiatives. Oregon, with about 3 million residents, owns 9,000
video poker machines that it places in 1,800 businesses. South
Dakota, with less than 1 million residents, has 8,000 gambling
machines in 1,400 locations. Montana has similar numbers of
machines in similar places, though the state does not run the
machines.
</P>
<P>
   These Western states introduced video gambling in the late '80s
and early '90s for one reason: It is a stupendously effective way
of parting citizens from their money. According to the North
American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries, the average
American in a state with a lottery spends about $150 per year on
the lottery. But in the five states with video lotteries (Delaware,
West Virginia, and Rhode Island, along with South Dakota and
Oregon), average per capitalottery spending is about $600 per
year. In South Dakota, where lottery play is the highest in the
country, the average person spends an amazing $750 per year on the
state lottery.
</P>
<P>
   This generates monster revenues for both state and retailer.
South Dakota's government splits the revenue 50-50 with the bars
and restaurants. The state clears $90 million a year, which it is
using to cut property taxes 20 percent. (This money represents
about 5 percent of the total state budget.)
</P>
<P>
   In Oregon, the state takes about two-thirds of the video lottery
revenues. That amounts to more than $230 million a year--about 3
percent of the budget--which the state spends on education, parks,
and salmon restoration. (''What do Oregon's public schools,
businesses, workforce, state parks and salmon all have in common?''
boasts the Oregon Lottery's home page. ``They all receive Lottery
profits to help them prepare for the future!'')
</P>
<P>
   In Montana, the state pockets 15 percent of video gambling
revenue in taxes, close to $40 million for the state's treasury.
(Both Oregon and South Dakota also run traditional lotteries, but
they are penny-ante games next to the video lottery: Only a quarter
of Oregon's lottery revenue comes from traditional lottery games,
and only 5 percent of South Dakota's does.)
</P>
<P>
   Video gambling delivers tax revenues, but it exacts huge social
costs. Video poker is known as ``video crack.'' Its rate of play is
dizzyingly fast--I once played more than 400 games of video poker
in an hour--and the flashing lights and flickering screens send
players into trancelike reveries.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other kinds of gambling, video poker discourages social
interaction. ``The machines suck people into the screen,'' says
Professor William Thompson, a gambling expert at the University of
Nevada, Las Vegas. ``You don't talk or socialize. You don't trade
stories. It is different from blackjack or even handle slots. These
are the most addictive of any gambling instrument we have today.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also voracious: A typical gambler addicted to blackjack
takes about 20 years from placing the first bet to bottoming out; a
gambler hooked on video poker needs less than three years.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Gamblers Anonymous chapters in Oregon has leapt
from three to 30 since video poker was introduced in 1992. (The
state itself recognizes the dangers of video poker: It forbids
video lottery advertising and allocates $3 million a year for
treating problem gamblers.)
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the small stakes in video lotteries encourage
addiction. Unlike lotteries, which offer low odds but spectacular
jackpots, video poker returns tiny but frequent pots. The state
relies on people playing the games over and over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   Addiction is not the only drawback of video gambling. It is a
cinch for kids to play video lottery machines, since they are often
found in businesses that kids frequent. Though it pays off more
often than lotteries, video poker offers poor odds compared with
most casino gambling, taking about 10 cents of every dollar bet
compared to 3 cents for casino slots.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, convenience gambling doesn't deliver the secondary
economic benefits that big gambling can. Because states limit the
number of machines that any one business can have, there are no
large casinos. So video lottery brings none of the ancillary jobs,
restaurants, and hotels that big casinos do.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, convenience gambling is emerging as the kind of
gambling that everyone can dislike, a juicy target for opponents
and a scapegoat for supporters of more acceptable kinds of
wagering. A bipartisan grassroots campaign in South Carolina just
eliminated its enormous video poker industry.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, half the parishes in Louisiana threw out video
gambling from their bars, restaurants, and truck stops. Several
years ago, the mayor of Las Vegas, who strongly supported casinos,
tried to root out convenience gambling from stores in her city. The
rest of the gambling industry treats convenience gambling like an
embarrassing cousin, routinely condemning it.
</P>
<P>
   South Dakota and Oregon have preserved a last best argument
against the critics: They can't afford to drop video lotteries.
Governors in both states have said they dislike relying on lottery
revenues to fund essential government services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor has never been a big fan of the lottery and of
letting gambling policy drive public policy,'' says a spokesman for
Oregon's Gov. John Kitzhaber. But they are too scared of losing
their video lottery funds to endorse the ballot initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   When the Oregon ballot initiative was floated earlier this year,
Kitzhaber endorsed the idea of abolishing the video lottery but
said the state needed a phaseout period to find replacement
revenue. So the activists added a three-year phaseout to their
ballot initiative. Kitzhaber now insists on a phaseout of at least
six years. ``He wants to get rid of it, but then he wants six
years. He sounds like an addict,'' says the anti-gambling
coalition's Grey.
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon and South Dakota votes are a year away, and the
Montana signature-gathering has not yet begun. No one knows whether
even one of the initiatives can pass. The lottery retailers will
surely spend millions to keep their cash cow, and the governors are
likely to campaign for video gambling as well.
</P>
<P>
   But if the initiatives do squeak by, they may signal a new and
encouraging compromise, a recognition that just because gambling is
legal does not mean it has to be everywhere. If the initiatives
pass, after all, the states will retain their traditional
scratch-off and Powerball lotteries, and their Indian casinos will
continue to offer electronic gambling on reservations.
</P>
<P>
   These states will have gambling that is accessible, but not
universal; gambling that funds state government but does not hold
it hostage.

 &HT;    Rage reconsidered: Message and muscle
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Dec. 19.
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1993, when the band got a career-launching break touring with
Lollapalooza, Rage Against the Machine came off as an outfit of
callow hell-raisers. With its crunchy rhythms and searing electric
guitar, the band had no problem getting the mostly under-25 crowd
bounding up and down all over the dirt field in suburban New
Jersey, where I first saw Rage, but there was also something really
silly about the group.
</P>
<P>
   Vocalist Zack de la Rocha, dreadlocks flapping like Bob Marley's
as he threw his spindly frame to and fro like a leaping dolphin,
went on a long tirade about concert T-shirts and his record company
and how everyone needed to rage along with him about grievances
that seemed petty and ephemeral. Guess the man was holding him
down, but the really great rock bands that have made agit-prop and
revolutionary rhetoric part of their game plan _ think of the Clash
in the late 1970s or the Minutemen in the mid-1980s _ never got
hung up on the small stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, Rage is on tour with a new album, its third and
best, called ``The Battle of Los Angeles.'' The group already
weathered the battle of Woodstock '99, where its constituency raged
against the automatic teller machines, and where it found itself at
a specific point in the contemporary rock continuum. While white,
rap and funk-influenced acts like the Beastie Boys and the Red Hot
Chili Peppers have made varying (and varyingly sincere) efforts to
achieve and preach a reformed bad boy enlightenment, the artists
Spin magazine recently denounced as ``rap-rock mooks'' _ Fred Durst
of Limp Bizkit is taking most of the heat _ have taken over the
charts, promoting old-school misogyny and the bratty thrills of a
self-involved adolescent response to the usual frustrations. Rock
'n' roll!
</P>
<P>
   Musically, at least, Rage is a major influence on this school,
which has, at times, been as innovative in expanding the frontiers
of mainstream rock (deconstructing sonic conventions with weird
noise, basically) as it's been retrograde in reclaiming the inner
caveman. But, as the group showed during its recent performance at
Atlanta's Philips Arena, that's where the comparisons end.
Guitarist Tom Morello suggests they occupy nose-bleed seats in the
arena built by the MC5, Marley and Public Enemy _ three very
different performers for whom social protest was a common
touchstone _ yet, Rage is clearly coming into its own. Morello
commands a fierce economy on his instrument, slung high on his
chest as if he were Wes Montgomery, while seeming to be two
musicians at once: He gets all the gonzo noise-bursts that hip-hop
DJs and art-rock dudes like the guys in Sonic Youth specialize in,
while conjuring the ghosts of every great '60s power trio that ever
existed. Mostly, the Jimi Hendrix Experience and Cream. Not
slavishly, either, but in the way a pianist might think of
Thelonious Monk or Bill Evans while playing his own thing. When it
works, it's titanic and primal and stunningly confounding. At last,
a technician with heart.
</P>
<P>
   Propelled by a rhythm section as limber as it is muscular, de la
Rocha has become a vastly more effective rapper. He still dolphins
like crazy around the stage _ you'd think he invented Flubber _ but
lyrically he's more grounded. Tracks such as ``Testify'' and
``Guerrilla Radio'' dig deeper than bumper-sticker sentiment,
reaching for a more complicated play of rhymes and images while
targeting the devils we know (the media, multinational
corporations, guns vs. butter) and stepping up the insurgent
message. Despite de la Rocha's very cool self-defense advisory to
the women in the mosh pit on the arena's general admission floor,
it's rousingly masculine music. The message can easily be swallowed
by the medium, though the energy it unleashes in the crowd is
thrilling. Rage fans dance like it's high-impact aerobics: fists
pumping and swirling, bodies bounding in place, hips locked into a
groove. None of that twirly dervish business you see at Dave
Matthews concerts, which are anesthesia by comparison. Hate to drop
a tired buzz word, but, yeah, it's empowering. And it's only one
part of another continuum, which includes socially conscious
entertainers like Atlanta's Indigo Girls and Nashville's Steve
Earle and Bruce Springsteen (whose ``The Ghost of Tom Joad'' was
taken by Rage and exploded into a million tiny bits) and Ani
DiFranco _ people who actually try to say something in their songs,
rather than angling for a gossip column glamour shot with the Dalai
Lama.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to like the songs. You don't have to like the
message. But when those two things meet successfully, you have to
listen. As a wise man once said, when the ship is sinking you've
got to go overboard. Bands like Rage Against the Machine are
leading the way.

 &HT;    TV's Walton clan `Together Again' in Christmas reunion album
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Dec. 19.
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If anyone were to ask me where I would most like to spend
Christmas this year, the answer would be simple: at the Waltons.'
</P>
<P>
   Since 1971, when the made-for-TV movie ``The Homecoming'' first
aired on CBS, the fictitious Blue Ridge Mountain family with all
those double names has become the essence of what Christmas is
supposed to be, at least if you grew up in the rural South: strings
of popcorn, red blooms on a Christmas cactus, cracking black
walnuts, trudging deep into the woods to pick out a tree, placing a
bird's nest on its branches. For millions of fans, the frame house
with its sit-a-spell porch and long family dinner table stirs deep
holiday longings, a place where gritty reality _ job stress, broken
families _ dissolves into fantasies of sipping hot chocolate with
Grandma and swapping homemade gifts.

   This year, fans can get even closer to Walton's Mountain, thanks
to country songwriter Bruce Burch. A Gainesville native who now
heads EMI's publishing division in Nashville, Burch brought the
whole cast together for a reunion recording called ``A Walton's
Christmas: Together Again.'' It features 19 tracks of Christmas
song standards, warm-fuzzy recitations and chitchat among the
actors, right down to the mandatory bedtime mantra, ``Good night,
'Liv. ... Good night, John. ... Good night, Grandma. ... Good
night, Erin. ... Good night, Ben.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect anything polished. The music is a folksy blend of
sentiment and song that captures the clannish camaraderie of the
show, from John-Boy (Richard Thomas) reading ``The Night Before
Christmas'' to group sing-alongs that sound kind of like the sweet
rawness of the old ``Hee Haw'' Gospel Quartet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is true to the spirit of the characters on the
show,'' explains Jon Walmsley, who played the gangly Jason Walton
and who produced the album and recruited his co-stars for the
project. ``The idea is an evening at the Waltons' at Christmastime
with everyone swapping stories. ... We did the cast vocals in L.A.,
and it turned into a big, festive party atmosphere. We're such good
friends that everyone went along with it enthusiastically.''
</P>
<P>
   As the only musician in the cast, Walmsley provides most of the
vocals and plays guitar. He co-wrote five original songs and gave
the album a bluegrass-country feel on such familiar tunes as
``Christmas Time's a Comin','' ``Sleigh Ride'' and ``Have Yourself
a Merry Little Christmas.'' In his soothing Virginia dialect,
familiar narrator and ``Waltons'' creator Earl Hamner Jr. reads an
original holiday piece written specifically for the record. Jerry
Goldsmith's infectious ``Walton's Theme'' has been redone as a
fiddle tune. There's even a song about ``Mama's Applesauce Cake,''
and the liner notes include the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   The album is dedicated to Will Geer (Grandpa), who died in 1978,
and Ellen Corby (Grandma), who died in April while her younger
co-stars were recording the album.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Walton ``kids'' are middle-aged now, but Burch
believes their fictitious family endures because ``they may be the
last of that kind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In this day and time, there's just not much family
entertainment,'' he says. ``Families today are `The Simpsons' or
`Married ... With Children.' `The Waltons' was the last show that
actually dealt with the traditional family. Think about what's
going on here at the millennium. Look at all the broken families,
Columbine. People may never get back to those traditional values in
reality, but in spirit they would like to.''
</P>
<P>
   More things Walton
</P>
<P>
   If watching ``The Homecoming'' or popping ``A Walton's
Christmas'' into the CD player don't have you smelling Papa's
Recipe, check out these other routes to Walton's Mountain:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Walton's Mountain Museum: The real John-Boy, writer
Hamner, grew up in the tiny mountain hamlet of Schuyler, Va. The
family home is still there. (Hamner's brother James, aka Jim-Bob,
lives there.) Across the street, the community's elementary school
has been converted into a Waltons museum. Curators have
reconstructed sets from the show, including the family's 1930s-era
living room and John-Boy's bedroom with writing desk. You can buy
souvenirs, such as T-shirts, videotapes and pages from original
scripts, in the Ike Godsey Store and Gift Shop. Located on Va. 617
between Charlottesville and Lynchburg, the museum is open 10 a.m.-4
p.m. daily from the first Saturday in March through the last Sunday
in November. Admission: $5 adults, $4 senior citizens, children
under 12 free. For information, call 804-831-2000.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Web site: In the early 1990s, Ralph Griffin, 57, recovered
from a heart attack by watching reruns of ``The Waltons'' every
night. He says he became fascinated with the show, archiving every
episode ``because I grew up in a home like that, a simplistic life
that I identified with.'' Griffin eventually created a detailed
Waltons Web site at www.the-waltons.com. It includes descriptions
of every episode, a complete list of guest stars and characters,
fan club information, biographies of all cast members, pictures of
the real Hamner family, theme music, sound clips from shows, a
Waltons chat room and a calendar of Waltons-related events.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The documentary: ``The Waltons Legacy'' is a one-hour 1997
video that looks at the history of the Schuyler area, the Hamner
family and ``The Waltons'' television series. Originally produced
by WVPT public television in Harrisonburg, Va., it's available for
$24.95. To order, call 540-434-5391.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Waltons cruise: ``Waltons'' cast members often travel with
fans as part of vacation packages. The most recent outing was a
$500 excursion to the Bahamas with Mary McDonough (Erin), Judy
Norton (Mary Ellen), Walmsley (Jason) and Eric Scott (Ben). You can
find future events posted at www.the-waltons.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The television series: Reruns air on The Nashville Network at
1 and 7 p.m. Mondays-Thursdays and 1 p.m. Fridays.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Homecoming'' video: May be ordered through
www.amazon.com for $9.98. Amazon also offers several episodes of
the television series.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``A Walton's Christmas: Together Again'': The CD may also be
ordered through www.amazon.com for $12.99.

 &HT;    With 2000 just around the corner, predictions about the end
times abound
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yellow type, outlined in red, screams from the cover of the
supermarket tabloid the Weekly World News: ``ARE WE ON THE EVE OF
JUDGEMENT DAY?''
</P>
<P>
   Below it is a warning that the prophecies detailed within
(alongside articles about a refrigerator exorcism and a chihuahua
who survived being flushed down the toilet) may be ``terrifying.''
The sensational supermarket publication is one in a plethora of
media, from National Public Radio to Newsweek, devoting time and
space to end times in the waning days of the 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   As Christians mark the season of Advent leading up to a
celebration of what they believe was the incarnation of the
messiah, some are anticipating Jesus' imminent return to Earth. A
1997 Associated Press poll showed that nearly one of every four
Christian adults _ some 26.5 million Americans _ expect Jesus to
come back during their lifetimes. Almost 40 percent say he will
arrive by the end of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   The Christmas story is replete with pictures of a sweet baby in
a manger. In contrast, the Second Coming is usually seen in terms
of spectacular images of devastation.
</P>
<P>
   The impending change in the calendar has pumped up the volume on
predictions. The public is gobbling them up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our readers, as most people, are very concerned about what's
going to happen with the new millennium,'' said Susan Jimison,
managing editor of the 400,000-circulation Weekly World News.
``We're sending them every story on that that we come across.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimison's company is not the only publisher that has found
profit in feeding the end-time frenzy. As time until 2000 dwindles,
the volumes stack up. The megahit novels in the ``Left Behind''
series by Family Life seminar founder Tim LaHaye and Christian
author Jerry Jenkins have sold roughly 9 million copies and leapt
from Christian best-seller lists to those of The New York Times,
USA Today and The Wall Street Journal. Christian publisher Tyndale
House has extended the series from three to seven to 12 volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Why are human beings so fascinated with the ultimate finale?
</P>
<P>
   For people who think the culture is hellbound, the dissolution
of the present world order is appealing, said Ted Daniels, editor
of ``A Doomsday Reader'' (New York University Press, 1999, 256
pages, $18.95), which explores apocalyptic writings from Marx to
Aum Shinri Kyo, the Japanese sect charged with 1995 poison gas
attacks on Tokyo subways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the core issue here is that the millennium promises
salvation and it promises it right here and now,'' said Daniels.
``All the corruption and sin that's in the world is going to be
swept away and replaced by a perfect order.''
</P>
<P>
   There's the added tension that, since World War II, people have
lived with the existence of weapons that could destroy the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Louvin Brothers, a 1940s country duo, were sure the
apocalypse would come in the form of an A-bomb. They sang, in
toe-tapping rhythm: ``Are you ready for the great atomic power?
Will you rise and meet your Savior in the air? Will you shout or
will you cry, when the fire rains from on high?''
</P>
<P>
   People living with the potential of annihilation like to think
they can know the future and therefore feel less helpless, said
Tina Pippin, associate professor of religious studies at Agnes
Scott College. ``There's a need to control, to be in the inside
group,'' she said. ``You've got this insurance, this heavenly,
glorious future with God.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Pippin's fall classes was called ``Apocalypse and
Revolution.'' Students watched the films ``The Omega Code'' and
``End of Days.'' They listened to R.E.M.'s ``It's the End of the
World As We Know It'' and the long version of Madonna's ``Justify
My Love,'' which quotes from the Book of Revelation. They made
journals and wrote poetry. One student even produced her own
supermarket tabloid.
</P>
<P>
   They've joked about the commercialism they've seen in end-times
products, such as the literal ``Keys to the Kingdom,'' but there
has also been a serious side, said Pippin, ``like the possibility
of trains carrying nuclear waste going in front of the campus.''
</P>
<P>
   Good vs. evil
</P>
<P>
   The study of the end in religion has its own name _ eschatology
_ taken from the Greek root meaning ``last.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the majority of people in the United States are Christian,
most end-time scenarios in this country are derived from the
Christian Bible, especially the Book of Revelation.
</P>
<P>
   In general, many Christians believe: The world will undergo a
battle between good and evil (Christ and Antichrist), often called
Armageddon. Humankind will endure terrible turmoil known as the
``tribulation.'' Jesus will return, as the Apostles' Creed says,
``to judge the quick and the dead.'' There will be 1,000 years of
peace. And finally _ God's perfect reign.
</P>
<P>
   Christians pray for this eventuality in the Lord's Prayer or the
Our Father when they say, ``Thy kingdom come.''
</P>
<P>
   But the nature and sequence of events _ whether Jesus will come
before or after the time of trouble, and whether they are literal
or figurative _ are matters of great debate.
</P>
<P>
   Some Christians, including broadcaster Pat Robertson, say the
faithful will have to endure the troubles leading up to Christ's
reign; others believe the church will be ``raptured'' or
miraculously taken into heaven before the times of difficulty.
Hence the bumper stickers: ``In case of the Rapture, this vehicle
will be unoccupied'' and ``Beam Me Up, Jesus.'' One New York
insurance company even promises to pay off the life insurance
policies of Christians who are raptured.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus is quoted in Matthew 24:36 as saying not even he knows
when he will return, but some of his followers pore over Scriptures
looking for clues. True believers hear the hoofbeats of approaching
apocalypse in news reports of earthquakes, hurricanes and school
shootings, diseases such as AIDS and Ebola, modern developments
such as credit cards and automatic teller machines, and
international alliances such as the European Union and World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the chaos that would result from massive computer
failure on Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In the high-tech 1990s, street-corner prophets have traded in
their sandwich boards for sites on the World Wide Web. There they
catalog their evidence _ from plagues of locusts in Uzbekistan to
legalized euthanasia in the Netherlands. ``It means Jesus is about
to return, folks!'' TV preacher and prognosticator Jack Van Impe
recently proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   Predictions not new
</P>
<P>
   The predictions are nothing new. Ignatius, bishop of Antioch,
who died about 110, is reported to have said, ``The last times are
upon us.'' The king of recent date-setters is probably Hal Lindsey,
whose 1970 best seller ``The Late Great Planet Earth'' _ which went
through more than 100 printings _ predicted that God would put the
period at the end of the present world order in 1988 after
rapturing the faithful in 1981. An ``updated'' version says Jesus
is coming in 2007.
</P>
<P>
   On the opposite end of the spectrum from the date-setters are
the people such as Gary DeMar of Atlanta, author of ``Last Days
Madness'' (American Vision, 4th edition 1999, 455 pages, $19.95),
who argue that the events of Revelation took place centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   DeMar is president of American Vision, a Reconstructionist
Christian organization that seeks to bring about a kingdom of God
right here in the United States _ by making the Bible its primary
charter and modeling a legal system on the Old Testament.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Book of Revelation is not talking about our time,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than looking at the Bible and interpreting current
events, people are looking at current events and forcing them into
the Bible,'' said Richard Abanes, a California Southern Baptist
whose most recent book is called ``End-Time Visions'' (Broadman &AMP;
Holman, 1998, 424 pages, $9.99).
</P>
<P>
   Many other Christians, drawing a line between anticipation and
prediction, caution against date-setting but conclude that the end
is, indeed, nigh.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Ed Hindson, a Southern Baptist minister who lives in
Tucker, has been a student of eschatology since he was a teenager.
</P>
<P>
   Hindson, whose newest book is ``Earth's Final Hour'' (Harvest
House, 1999, 207 pages, $9.99), says, ``It's hard to read the Bible
and then turn around and read the newspaper without seeing some
parallel there.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he believes Jesus wants Christians to watch for him to
return, but to keep serving until he does. ``Genuine Christianity
has to live in tension between the fact that Jesus could come at
any moment and the possibility that he may not come in your
lifetime,'' he said. ``You keep your eye on the sky and your feet
on the earth.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, Catholics and so-called mainline Protestants
de-emphasize the end times. Although some conservative Catholics
see apocalyptic significance in the changes in the church since the
second Vatican Council, most don't read Revelation in an attempt to
match up its descriptions with current events, said Mark Jordan, a
Catholic scholar in the religion department at Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of all the hoopla, many Christians struggle daily
to live out the message of their faith without forecasting the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central message is that God is trustworthy whatever the
suffering, whatever the turmoil,'' said Don Saliers, professor of
theology and worship at Emory University's Candler School of
Theology.
</P>
<P>
   As the world awaits another Christmas, Saliers said, ``something
is alive now in history that makes us hopeful and makes us work for
justice and makes us want people to be healing and makes us want to
dry the tears and have no more Kosovo, no more Columbine.''
</P>
<P>
   For Christians, that something is faith, he said. ``We think
about the Second Coming only because we're so confident in the
first.''

NEW PLACE DOESN'T AGREE WITH OLD FRIEND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: My little computer was running fine before I
packed it up and moved to a new city. It stayed in my closet for
about three months before I found the time to set it up again. When
I plugged everything in, it screamed, ``Operating system not
found.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Un-Smooth Operator
</P>
<P>
   DEAR UN: Well, how would you feel if somebody ignored you for
three months at a time? Sure, my ex-girlfriend never seemed to
mind. At least I think she didn't, but I haven't seen her for a
while, and she's not returning my calls.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe all that time in the closet was the last straw for the
computer. Stored in an unusual position, the drive platters might
warp, especially if they were exposed to temperature extremes.
Maybe excess dust got into the drive or the spindle lubricant
turned into sludge.
</P>
<P>
   Pop the cover, blow the dust away, and try listening to your
computer for a change. Does it sound like it used to? Does the
drive activity light come on? You really have nothing left to lose,
so turn off the PC and give the drive a sharp smack on the side.
Sometimes that frees anything that's gummed up. It feels good, too.
But don't let my therapist hear that.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe your problem runs deeper than simply ignoring your PC. I
don't think it handled the move very well, but you can't really
blame it: Moving was your idea.
</P>
<P>
   I hope you realize how fragile your computer is and that
bouncing around in the back of a moving truck is no life for a
delicate piece of machinery. It's entirely possible that the hard
drive suffered physical damage.
</P>
<P>
   Most drives retract their recording heads when you power them
down, but a good jolt might send one of them clanging into the disk
surface.
</P>
<P>
   So, what's next? I'd probably end the relationship at this
point: Reformat the drive and install Windows again. If there is
drive damage, though, it's not going to get any better. Some things
just can't be fixed. But, don't worry. There are plenty of other
drives in the computer store. I'm sure you'll find the one meant
just for you.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I take issue with the blanket statement that
simply reading an e-mail is safe. It has recently been shown that
reading or previewing an e-mail may cause a problem. There is a
patch on the Microsoft site, but it is just a matter of time before
virus writers are able to work around the patch. While the greatest
risk comes from opening attachments, sadly, it is no longer true
that reading e-mail is 100 percent safe.
</P>
<P>
   _ Inoculated
</P>
<P>
   DEAR INOC: Nothing is safe as long as there is one doofus out
there who thinks he knows how to mess with your life. How long
before it's not even safe to get out of bed, much less do anything
productive on your computer?
</P>
<P>
   The viruses you're talking about are ``Trojan horses'' that
exploit the preview panes in some e-mail programs. The same kind of
hidden code that makes Web pages dance and sing can launch
destructive programs once they're activated by just previewing a
message.
</P>
<P>
   All we can do is keep informed about the latest viruses and
remedies at places like Symantec (www.symantec.com/avcenter/) or
McAfee (www.mcafee.com). That means checking every day, not
periodically. Remember, those dysfunctional dweebs have nothing
better to do. It's not like they have dates to the prom or
anything.

 &HT;    Meet the four Atlanta artists selected for America's most
prestigious exhibit
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Dec. 16.
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every two years, the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York
stages its great bazaar, the Whitney Biennial. The largest _ and
certainly the most raucous _ survey of contemporary art in the
country has a unique mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biennial is a hybrid of objective selection and passionate
advocacy,'' says Whitney Museum director Maxwell Anderson. ``It's
different from so many contemporary exhibitions in which the theme
is the key. It's not about ... a curator's vision. This is about
artists and their work.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the show have charged that it is also about
favoritism and politics. But, whatever its faults, the biennial is
hugely influential. Inclusion can potentially make an artist's
career. Not surprisingly, landing on the list is like making Phi
Beta Kappa and All-American at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the ultimate validation of all my years of work as an
artist,'' says Ruth Leitman.
</P>
<P>
   Leitman, a filmmaker, is one of four Atlanta artists, all under
the age of 40, selected for the 2000 biennial. Robin Bernat, a
video and book artist, painter Kojo Griffin and photographer Chris
Verene also are among the 97 participants.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that only about four Georgia artists total have ever
been in any biennial, the number alone is news. And good news for
the community at large. As Nexus Gallery director Teresa Bramlette
says, ``It puts us on the radar screen.''
</P>
<P>
   In a departure from past practice, the first biennial of the new
century, which runs March 23-June 4, was assembled by a team of six
regionally based curators. The curators tried to counter the
perceived New York bias by seeking out artists outside the inside
track, making studio visits nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Biennial curator Valerie Cassel came to Atlanta in August with a
list compiled by local critic Rebecca Dimling Cochran and High
Museum of Art curator Carrie Przybilla. Only one of the four
Atlanta artists selected, Verene, was on that list.
</P>
<P>
   Cassel happened to see Griffin's work while visiting Verene's
gallery, Vaknin Schwartz. Whitney director Anderson passed along
Bernat's videos to the curators for consideration. And Linda
Dubler, High Museum curator of media arts, was one of several who
recommended Leitman.
</P>
<P>
   But how is not the key. Being there is. Even those like
Pryzbilla, who calls the biennial ``more interesting than
important,'' says, ``There is no other forum like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Kojo Griffin's paintings are seductively pretty. The characters
_ patchwork dolls, people with animal heads _ look like something
out of a children's book. The roles they play are ambiguous. But
the mood isn't. Beyond their surface appeal, these images are
disturbing and sordid. They speak of abuse, suicide, impending
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I paint the moment before or the moment after something has
happened,'' says the artist, 28, sitting in the bare West End
warehouse that serves as his home and studio. ``I paint things
people don't like to talk about and deal with. I know I'm not going
to change the world, but I want to show people that they aren't
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was attracted to the subtle and intricate manner in which he
deals with complex issues,'' says curator Todd Smith of the Mint
Museum of Art in Charlotte, who exhibited Griffin's work in ``New
Frontiers,'' a series about young artists. ``And he does it with
such dexterity for one so early in his career.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffin's career began seven years ago, with the birth of his
older son, Zion. The lanky Virginia native was in school, dabbling
in graffiti and doing small graphic design projects to make ends
meet, when the weight of his new responsibility hit him. In mulling
his future, Griffin, who had come to Atlanta in 1989 to attend
Morehouse College, toyed with pursuing psychology, his major.
Instead he decided to take advantage of the gift he had never
appreciated and become an artist.
</P>
<P>
   Making art was always a private comfort zone. Griffin, who is
single, grew up in two Boston-area communities _ Brookline, where
he lived with his mother and sister, and Roxbury, where his father
lived.
</P>
<P>
   Tall and overweight as a child and saddled with an unusual name,
he didn't feel like he belonged anywhere. ``I love it now,'' he
says of his name, which he describes as an African word meaning
``unconquerable.'' ``But then I wished my name was Sam or Steven or
Joshua, like everyone else. I felt very isolated. Art was always my
refuge. I drew a lot and read comics.''
</P>
<P>
   Not belonging to one group permitted him to engage in many. For
instance, Griffin could absorb traditional aesthetics in classes
and field trips to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and get involved
with hip-hop in high school. He could make graffiti and still study
the I Ching and the cabala, a mystical Jewish philosophy. (He drew
Kether, the name of his 3-year-old son, from the cabala.) These
systems of knowledge find their way into paintings in abstracted
diagrams that overlay the figurative elements.
</P>
<P>
   The ambiguity of the characters in his paintings is a way of
keeping the paintings as open-ended as possible. By foregoing
specifics of race and gender, he hopes to make a pre-emptive strike
against those who might key their interpretation to the fact that
he is black. By making the action equivocal, Griffin thinks he
allows people to project their own experience into the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to communicate. That's why I make art,'' says the
artist, who teaches classes for the Fulton County Arts Council and
the city of Atlanta's Bureau of Cultural Affairs. ``The painting is
not the be-all and end-all. I care about craft, but it's more
important to have a dialogue with the viewer. That's art to me.''
</P>
<P>
   He has matured surprisingly quickly, and his career has mirrored
that trajectory. In the five years since his work began appearing
in local group exhibitions, he has joined the stable of the Vaknin
Schwartz gallery. He has had the solo show at Charlotte's Mint
Museum and will have another at the Kemper Museum of Contemporary
Art in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest leap of all will be seeing his paintings on the
walls of the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. Still,
Griffin, who is one of the biennial's youngest participants, is
taking a cautious approach to his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great opportunity,'' he says, ``but no guarantee.''
</P>
<P>
   ROBIN BERNAT
</P>
<P>
   Robin Bernat can confirm what we're told about the joy of
giving.
</P>
<P>
   After Maxwell Anderson, director of New York's Whitney Museum of
American Art, spoke here in June at a benefit for Art Papers, a
local art journal for which she is a board member, Bernat sent him
copies of her art videos and poetry books as thank you presents.
</P>
<P>
   Five months later, the Whitney told Bernat that she was on the
short list for its prestigious biennial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in enormous shock,'' recalls the 34-year-old artist. ``I
didn't even know I was being considered. I had sent them a personal
gift, not a submission.''
</P>
<P>
   She will be represented in the biennial by one of her videos,
aptly titled ``Effortless.''
</P>
<P>
   In the piece, the word signifies an unattainable goal. In a
voice-over of one of her poems, Bernat expresses grief over her
father's murder 20 years ago and describes the social unease that
has plagued her since. The video features a salamander, which
adapts easily to changing environments, and symbolizes the
effortlessness for which she longs. Images such as the slow,
rhythmic arc of a lawn sprinkler and long pans of country roads
establish an appropriate mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robin gets at the subtle nuance of feeling in her videos,''
says critic Jerry Cullum. ``She captures what it feels like to be
an often frustrated and defeated romantic.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernat spent her Louisiana childhood immersed in arts. She wrote
poetry. Her father loved opera and dance. Her great-grandparents'
home in Monroe houses the town art museum, and she visited museums
everywhere she traveled. But Bernat couldn't imagine being an
artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was seeing the masters,'' she says. ``I knew I couldn't do
that. It wasn't until I went to art school that I understood it's
an incremental process.''
</P>
<P>
   She majored in political philosophy at the University of Georgia
but became interested in art history her senior year. After
dropping out of graduate school at Emory University, she applied to
Atlanta publishing houses for a job, including Nexus Press, which
she thought was a typical book-publishing establishment.
</P>
<P>
   That was a pivotal move. The press, a part of Nexus Contemporary
Art Center, is a renowned facility devoted to nurturing visual
artists who use the book format creatively and to publishing their
work. She went for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw the artists' books, it was like lightning struck,''
she recalls.
</P>
<P>
   In the medium, she found a way to meld her passion for words and
images. During this crash course in book arts, she made one book,
``Evidence of Living,'' which is shaped like a ``cootie catcher,''
a child's game.
</P>
<P>
   The internship not only opened up a new world but also propelled
her to art school. After earning her bachelor of fine arts at the
Atlanta College of Art in 1992, Bernat started Circle B Press in a
studio on Means Street. She has published six books of her poetry
and images under its imprint and one collaborative piece with her
writing group.
</P>
<P>
   Bernat, who teaches part time, made her first video in 1996.
``Video was a natural progression of combining narrative and
images,'' she explains. ``I needed them to be animated.''
</P>
<P>
   The videos _ she directs, narrates and performs in them _ almost
always start with her autobiographical poems. They are usually
presented as installations. ``Effortless'' was shown on three
custom-made maple monitors and three benches, along with a box of
talismanic souvenirs _ a ladybug, a leaf.
</P>
<P>
   Bernat often works in the serene Buckhead condominium she shares
with cats Pasha and Mama. A laptop and a set of sharpened colored
pencils sit on the desk of her book-lined study. When she gets
stuck creatively, she buys flowers and makes arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   She was hosting an Art Papers meeting in her home when she got
The Call. Bernat remembers asking the Whitney staffer if she could
tell her mother. She also remembers jumping up and down. A lot. The
euphoria has hardly worn off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very validating experience,'' she says. ``I always
believed in myself. I felt my art was authentic to me, but I never
thought anyone else got it.''
</P>
<P>
   RUTH LEITMAN
</P>
<P>
   Alma Thorpe, a blowsy mound of a woman in her 60s given to
wearing big hair bows and quoting the Bible, appears to be a
harmless Southern eccentric. Her daughter Margie knows better _ and
so do we, after seeing Ruth Leitman's searing documentary about
their destructive relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alma,'' which caps a triumphant stint on the film festival
circuit with its selection for the 2000 Whitney Biennial, is a
complex, compelling and perversely humorous story, creatively told.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film is set up like a mystery,'' says the artist, 37,
sipping coffee in Cabbagetown's Carroll Street Bakery near her home
and studio. ``It's like unpeeling an onion.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when you get to the central family revelation _ an
accusation of incest _ another mystery remains. Why, after you've
learned how a disturbed mother has damaged her daughter, can you
still like the ``villain''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ruth humanizes the characters so much that I had a hard time
dealing with Alma,'' says Linda Dubler, curator of media arts at
the High Museum of Art. ``I should have been horrified, but she's
viewed with such compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   Precisely Leitman's intention: ``I wanted people to like Alma
and Jim (Alma's husband), to see them as victims of their own
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert Maysles, the pioneering documentary filmmaker of ``Grey
Gardens'' and ``Gimme Shelter'' fame, was impressed with ``Alma.''
``You don't often see a documentary with a motivation out of love.
... Few people go beyond the technology,'' he says. ``To do that
you have to be empathetic. You're not a fly on the wall; you are
engaged.''
</P>
<P>
   As ``Alma'' co-producer Nancy Segler observes, ``Ruth respec subjects. They understand, appreciate and respond.'' That's why
Margie Thorpe chose to bring her story to Leitman.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was not condescending,'' Thorpe says. ``That was really
important as to who I was going to trust.''
</P>
<P>
   For an artist interested in ambivalence, this family was a
perfect subject. ``What completely intrigued me the minute I
started this project was that beyond all these difficulties, there
was love and understanding,'' Leitman says. ``Under all the
dysfunction, there was forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Leitman, a native of suburban Philadelphia, weaves together past
and present by way of photos and mementos, and she presents the
imagery more like a feature film than a report. The camera travels
lovingly through Alma's West End home, crammed with broken
furniture, religious paraphernalia and piles of papers and frosted
with grime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought of Alma as a poor Norma Desmond,'' the artist
explains, referring to the faded silent screen star in the 1950
film ``Sunset Boulevard.'' ``Her house was in beautiful decay. If
you open her cabinets, all this stuff _ recipes, religious writings
_ taped to the doors is eaten by roaches. It looks like lace.''
</P>
<P>
   She developed an eye for detail during her career as a
photographer. Leitman, who graduated from the University of the
Arts in Philadelphia, moved to Atlanta in 1984. She made her living
photographing rock musicians for magazines and record companies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, she co-founded a group called Photograffiti, which
provided this fan of Robert Frank, Gary Winogrand and Diane Arbus
with an outlet for her interest in street photography and social
issues. The group enlarged their photos into posters and stuck them
on buildings in the middle of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, about the time she married guitarist Steve
Dixon, Leitman started making the transition to filmmaking. She
returned north to film her first documentary, ``Wildwood,'' about
the girls of a New Jersey beach town, completed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I identified more with the gentile working-class girls in
Wildwood, N.J., than with (peers) of my Jewish middle-class
upbringing,'' she says. ``I was always interested in people who
were afforded less but had the strength and confidence to make
their way in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Making ``Alma'' required great determination. Staying with the
brutal subject matter was only one challenge. Raising funds over
the four years of filming was just as difficult. But her resolve
was truly put to the test when she had a stillborn child during the
sixth month of her pregnancy, just as she was starting the editing
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only took two weeks off,'' she recalls. ``Nancy (the
co-producer) had to scrape me off the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Happily, she and Dixon are now the doting parents of 1
1/2-year-old Ella, conceived, says the artist, on the day that her
first daughter was to have been born.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm making an epic film of Ella,'' she says. ``I asked Steve
the other day, `Do you think spending $100 a week on film
processing is excessive?'''
</P>
<P>
   She is also involved in a number of other projects. Among them,
Leitman is editing a film on a group of developmentally disabled
adults and trying her hand at writing a feature film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be like Louis Malle,'' she says. ``He made
documentaries and films. Each project was very different.''
</P>
<P>
   CHRIS VERENE
</P>
<P>
   These days it's hard to know what time zone Chris Verene is in,
let alone what city. When the Atlanta artist is not abroad planning
exhibitions of his photography in the Netherlands, France and
Greece, he is splitting time between New York and Georgia's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Even when he's stateside, he's going in many directions. He
might be finalizing the publication of an untitled book of
photographs. He might be playing wild-man drums with one of his
bands. He might not even be Chris Verene, but rather Cheri Nevers,
a cross-dressing ``it girl'' posing for repugnant cheesecake photos
or standing behind the camera at the Self-Esteem Studio Salon, a
part-performance, part-photo studio.
</P>
<P>
   Although Verene, 30, sees his art and music as interconnected,
he doesn't even try to link his various, uh, bodies of photography.
As the artist asserted in a telephone conversation from Amsterdam,
``Cheri Nevers needs a separate interview.''
</P>
<P>
   He does know _ and makes something out of _ family ties. His
paternal roots are in the prairie railroad community of Galesburg,
Ill., which has produced three generations of Verenes. He spent
holidays and summers there as a child, and he has devoted the
better part of 13 years creating a loving photographic portrait of
the town that is as quirkily American as ketchup on mac-n-cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Photography curator Tom Southall has purchased two of the
Galesburg photos for the High Museum of Art's collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was immediately struck, when I first arrived a year ago,
with how he uses the style of documentary photography without being
hung up oer it is fact,'' he says. ``He creates characters
not unlike Faulkner and Yoknapatawpha County. Finally a
photographer is using the freedom a novelist has felt all along.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he started the series, Verene spent five or six months out
of the year there. ``Photography is a slow process of watching and
waiting,'' he says. ``I could be there for a month and come home
with no pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Home'' is where the darkroom is: Atlanta. He moved here at 11
when his father, a philosophy professor, began teaching at Emory
University. His father and mother, an anthropologist, now run the
Institute for Vico Studies at Emory, which brings together Italian
Renaissance philosophy and the writings of James Joyce.
</P>
<P>
   Verene started taking pictures when he was 16 or 17. ``It was a
curiosity,'' he recalls. ``By the time I was 18, I was really
devoted to it.''
</P>
<P>
   He went to Emory and took photography classes at Georgia State
University, where he earned a master's. Atlanta artist Ruth
Leitman, a fellow biennial participant, remembers when Verene first
brought his photos to the Atlanta Photography Gallery in the early
'90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was hunched over, with big glasses _ the ultimate geek, but
he had a really interesting vision,'' recalls Leitman, who gave
Verene his first one-man show in her Cabbagetown studio.
</P>
<P>
   Verene, who plays drums, also became involved with the music
scene and community of artists in Cabbagetown, where he has lived
for eight years, next door to Leitman and her family. From 1994 to
1997, he played with the Rock-a-Teens. They recorded on Daemon
Records, the label owned by Indigo Girl Amy Ray, and he even played
drums on the Indigo Girls' ``Shed Your Skin.'' His duo, Bach on a
Hook, which plays electrified Bach partitas, is about to release a
CD. He also
</P>
<P>
   has a heavy-metal band, Fight Evil With Evil.
</P>
<P>
   Two points of crossover: His photos have appeared on seven album
covers, and Elton John and Antonio ``L.A.'' Reid of LaFace Records
have his prints in their collections.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his success, Verene, who is a full-time artist, is not
blase about his inclusion in the Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like it's not true,'' says the artist, who has never
been to a biennial. ``I'm very excited; it's what everybody talks
about.''
</P>
<P>
   The Whitney will be showing photos from his Camera Club series.
In this sly and inventive study, Verene focuses on the voyeuristic
nature of photography by taking pictures of amateur snappers as
they shoot photos of young women in pinup poses.
</P>
<P>
   He's watching the men watching the women. We're watching Verene
watch them. We're also watching a career take wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's getting a painful amount of positive attention,''
Southall says. ``It could go to one's head, knock one off his path.
But he's unusually self-directed and clear in his personal
motivations. Chris has a real chance to be a great photographer.''

 &HT;    South Georgia writer chronicles a life and a landscape in
'Ecology of a Cracker Childhood'
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Dec. 19.
 &HT;    By Jingle Davis
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAXLEY, Ga. The 10-acre junkyard where writer Janisse Ray spent
her early years sprawls alongside U.S. 1, its secrets screened from
passing traffic by trees, muscadine vines, dog fennel and ragweed.
Once Ray's parents kept sheep to crop the underbrush, but the sheep
are gone and the junkyard, like Ray, is all grown up.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, 37, is a successful writer, environmental activist and
mother. But the junkyard was once her universe. Along with her
parents, a sister and two brothers, she lived an isolated South
Georgia life cramped by poverty, mental illness and strict
fundamentalist beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Not allowed to see movies, newspapers or television, to take
part in Christmas or Easter celebrations, or even to socialize with
classmates outside of school, the Ray youngsters found their fun in
their father's junkyard. They paddled around its leaf-spattered
pond on rafts made of gas tanks ripped from old cars. They imagined
driving to exotic places in vehicles that would never ride the road
again. They soared above the junk in chinaberry and red maple
trees.
</P>
<P>
   Ray even believed that she and her siblings were found in the
junkyard as newborns, because that was the creation story their
parents told them.
</P>
<P>
   Ray left rural Appling County years ago in search of a wider
world. That she found the forest in spite of the trees is evident
in her first book of prose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ecology of a Cracker Childhood,'' published in late October by
Milkweed Editions and already in its second printing, interweaves
the story of Ray's unusual childhood with chapters about the
natural history of the once-vast longleaf pine forests that
blanketed the coastal plain from Virginia to Florida to west of the
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Both are stories of pain and loss. Both offer hope of healing.
</P>
<P>
   Now working on a book about rural communities, Ray has returned
to Appling County to live, at least for a time, in the heart pine
farmhouse her grandparents built 80 years ago. She is involved in
the fight against strip mining near the Okefenokee Swamp. She's
helping to establish a riverkeeper group for the giant Altamaha,
which borders Appling County to the north.
</P>
<P>
   She is also trying to reconcile more personal issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be back in my homeland, with all the pain and
weirdness that surrounds it,'' Ray said, sitting by the fireplace
that provides the only heat for her borrowed house. ``I wanted to
work things out with my dad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ecology of a Cracker Childhood'' contains unsparing
descriptions of the pain her father's mental illness and rigid
religious beliefs caused her as a child.
</P>
<P>
   When she was 6, she watched as Franklin Delano Ray, now 62, held
his arms up, called out, ``I'm coming, Lord,'' and then stepped
through a window, ``cracking the pane like thin ice on a pond,
snapping strips of white-painted frame.''
</P>
<P>
   Another day, he locked his wife, Lee Ada, and children into a
back bedroom with a 6-foot chest freezer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That day, he wanted us to be quiet, and we were,'' Ray writes.
``We sat where he told us to sit. Each of us obeyed him perfectly
and immediately, watching wide-eyed as Daddy ranted in what I now
know to be mania.''
</P>
<P>
   When the children begged for food, Frank Ray at first refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toward evening, he permitted Mama to reach into the freezer
with her eyes closed and choose one thing for us to eat. `Honey,
you know we can't eat raw food out of that freezer. Let me go cook
us some supper,' (Lee Ada) protested. `One thing,' he said. ``No
more no less. I'll hold the lid for you. You have to close your
eyes. That's the way God says to feed the children. One thing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ray counters those harsh memories with accounts of her father's
abundant love for his family, his inventive genius with scraps
salvaged from the junkyard, his insistence that the children learn
to think and value knowledge. She describes his tender efforts to
save a wild green-backed heron hit by a car and an endangered
gopher tortoise captured and spray-painted gold and silver by a
roadside fruit seller.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Ray still lives on the junkyard property with Lee Ada, in
the two-story red brick house the family built to replace the
smaller home where Janisse Ray grew up. He admitted that his
daughter's book ``jarred me around a little bit'' when he read it
in draft form.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did my best not to make my mind up until I finished it,'' he
said. ``I backed up and tried to look at it objectively. I decided
overall that it was a great book and worthy to be published and go
out.''
</P>
<P>
   His pride in his daughter is evident.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's always been smart, and she didn't just get that way
yesterday,'' he said, telling how Ray was her high school's STAR
student, graduated fourth in her class, wrote prize-winning poetry
and put out the school newspaper almost single-handedly.
</P>
<P>
   He has become an enthusiastic salesman of her books, hauling
boxes of them to libraries in Ludowici and Nahunta when she is
doing readings in small towns nearby. He tells people that his
daughter's book is ``the best book I ever read besides the Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Ray's relatives agree. Some are angry with her for
writing so openly about the family, especially the mental illness
that has plagued it for generations.
</P>
<P>
   A cousin in Florida recently left an angry message on her
answering machine. ``If we're all crazy in that book then you're
crazy as hell, too,'' a woman's strident voice said. ``I don't
appreciate what you done.''
</P>
<P>
   Another cousin called Ray's Minnesota publisher with similar
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is,'' Ray said, ``everything I wrote is the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Appling County residents have been more accepting. Members of
Spring Branch Baptist Church invited Ray to take her grandmother's
place there after she came back home.
</P>
<P>
   Although she doesn't attend church, she appreciated the
invitation. ``That was a tender and warm welcome,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that life in the rural community revolves around church
does limit her social options, Ray said, though she keeps in close
touch with far-flung friends around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here think that because there's beer at the bottom of
my refrigerator, I'm going to hell. And you cannot talk about the
joy or terror of your life, and other real things.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving home, Ray got a degree in English and creative
writing from Florida State University, living near Tallahassee in a
two-room shanty she built with friends. There, she joined forces
with experts who taught her botany and astronomy. She learned about
organic gardening, beekeeping and drying fruit. She wrote poetry,
joined the Audubon Society and wrote articles for wildlife
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   She also conceived her son, Silas, now 11. A granny midwife
delivered him at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was part of my lifestyle to have him at home _ part of my
culture,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Four months later, with baby Silas balanced on her hip, Ray
married his father, a marquetry artist named Breeze VerDant, at the
county courthouse. ``I didn't want to get married, and it was a
mistake,'' she said. The marriage lasted less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Divorced and needing work, she took a job teaching English in
Colombia. Terrified of that country's armed guerrillas and by
stories of stolen children, Ray stayed six months before fleeing
back to the Florida shanty. Her newly acquired Spanish-language
skills helped her land a job with the state. Then she began a
``serious search'' for the direction of her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I wanted to combine the two things I loved the most:
environmental activism and writing.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 she went back to college, earning a master's degree in
environmental studies and English from the University of Montana.
One summer during graduate school, while Silas was visiting his
father in Vermont, she wrote the draft of her book. It took two
more years to finish it.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty of blending family history and natural history
frustrated her. At the suggestion of her editor at Milkweed, Ray
eventually organized the book by alternating chapters of childhood
memories with chapters about longleaf pines.
</P>
<P>
   Ray has become a passionate spokeswoman for the stately trees,
which once covered more than half of the 156 million acres in their
Southeastern range. By 1930, only a few thousand acres _ less than
1 percent _ of old-growth longleaf pines remained. The trees were
lost to agriculture, to development and to paper and timber
companies, which favor faster-growing varieties of pine. Today,
regimented ranks of loblolly and slash pine have turned much of the
rural South into a landscape as monotonous as the moon's.
</P>
<P>
   With the pines went the wiregrass that blanketed the ground
beneath them. Trees and grass had supported a huge and diverse
community: red-cockaded woodpeckers, indigo snakes, gopher
tortoises and hundreds of other plants and animals, many now rare
or endangered. Ray is eloquent in her descriptions of the old
forests:
</P>
<P>
   ``In a longleaf forest, miles of trees forever fade into a
brilliant salmon sunset and reappear the next dawn as a battalion
marching out of fog. The tip of each needle carries a single drop
of silver. The trees are so well spaced that their limbs seldom
touch and sunlight streams between and within them. Below their
flattened branches, grasses arch their tall, richly dun heads of
seeds, and orchids and lilies paint the ground orange and scarlet.
Purple liatris gestures across the landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   She also describes the voices of the trees:
</P>
<P>
   ``What thrills me most about longleaf forests is how the pine
trees sing. The horizontal limbs of flattened crowns hold the wind
as if they are vessels, singing bowls, and air stirs in them like a
whistling kettle.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray urges Southerners to fight for restoration of the longleaf
habitat. ``We want more than 1 percent natural stands of longleaf.
We know a pine plantation is not a forest and the wholesale
conversion to monocultures is unacceptable to us,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Hermann, a research scientist specializing in plant and
fire ecology at Tall Timbers Research Station near Tallahassee,
said Ray paints an accurate picture of old longleaf forests. The
station, one of six such independent, nonprofit research
organizations in the country, owns or manages more than 6,000 acres
in North Florida and South Georgia that embrace one of the largest
surviving stands of longleaf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a frequent situation that someone who writes prose
also has an understanding of the natural setting,'' Hermann said.
``She saw early on that nature is not just something to be enjoyed
but to be understood.''
</P>
<P>
   The connection came naturally for Ray, who remembers spending
much of her childhood outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think something in me from the very start loved nature,''
she said, showing visitors around the old farmstead where she
lives. Her uncle, who owns the property on a yellow dirt road near
Baxley, lives in a trailer a few hundred steps away. Nearby are an
old corncrib, a ramshackle log woodshed, the boiler where the
family made cane syrup and the well where they drew water. Beyond
are fields, empty this time of year, where Ray's relatives will
plant cotton, corn or soybeans come spring. There are a handful of
longleaf pines, which sing Ray and Silas to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people live close to the land here,'' Ray said, gazing
across the rustic property with love and pride. ``That's part of
this culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Collier, Appalachian regional representative for the Sierra
Club, said environmentalists are beginning to discover Ray's book.
Collier said he believes Ray's message is one of redemption, both
from the pain of her early life and her sense of loss over the
ravaging of her homeland's native forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's saying, `Don't give up on the landscape. It was once
beautiful and can be again.' She's also saying that her childhood
might have been rough at times, but there's a lot of richness
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray isn't sure her future, or her son's, lies in Appling County,
where many residents don't finish high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been hard for Silas to find friends here, hard to find
kids raised the way he has been, to have a voice in everything,''
she said. ``He's been really lonely. He says, `Here, there is no
imagination.'''
</P>
<P>
   And while her parents love Silas and keep him while she travels,
their philosophy of child rearing sometimes clashes with hers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was invited to go to a Pokemon movie with his friend, Caleb
... and my folks wouldn't let him go,'' Ray said. ``I called home
from a pay phone in Savannah and he was so sad, crying on the
phone. It just epitomized how it was when I was a child.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray wound up crying herself, helplessly beating her fists on the
seat of her car.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my only fear for Silas,'' she said. ``That what
happened to me doesn't happen to him. The isolation, the
misinformation.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she fears that rural communities such as
Baxley will vanish as more and more people like her move away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two-thirds of us live in cities now. I feel like somebody has
to stay and inhabit the ghost towns, to combat the ignorance and
racism.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, she's content to finish her next book, fight for
environmental causes and spend time with her family.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent autumn afternoon, Ray and her father took a walk
together through the junkyard, each enjoying it in a different way.
</P>
<P>
   The place has an exotic beauty, especially when drifts of dark
red pine straw and golden hardwood leaves carpet the ground and
soften the ragged edges of rust and rot. Amber sunlight plays
across half a century's worth of rusting cars and car parts, bales
of bottles and jagged glass, broken household goods, rotting
furniture, crumbling plastic and mutilated tools and toys.
</P>
<P>
   Although Frank Ray is no longer active in the junk business, he
knows every twisting path and tumbled pile. He points out the
rusted 1939 Packard with the Shriner emblem on the door, the
resting place of the old grits mill and the rust-brown truck he
drove 40 years ago, hauling scrap iron to Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   As he chronicles the story of each item, his daughter pauses to
identify the voices of birds gossiping from the bushes and to
admire a clump of pitcher plants. She stops by a young tree pushing
up through the junk toward light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy, look, it's a longleaf pine,'' she says, sliding her
hand over slender needles like someone stroking a pet cat.
</P>
<P>
   Her father examines the tree. ``No, I don't believe it is,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   The two look at each other, both smart and strong-willed, their
beliefs clashing. Then they walk on, leaving the issue of the
tree's identity unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken a long time, but Janisse Ray and her father are
learning to walk away from differences. Their love for each other
compels them to search, even in a junkyard, for the sweetness of
common ground.

   MIDEAST-TRAVEL _ JERUSALEM _ A review of what's going on at the
millennium sites. At Armageddon, the place where the battle to end
all battles is supposed to occur, the Israelis have fixed up the
park that is there. At the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where
orthodox Christians believe Christ was crucified, the five
bickering denominations in charge are trying to agree on where to
place an exit door _ the first change in the church in years. In
Bethlehem, the Palestinians have rebuilt the plaza and torn down
the ugly old British jail next to the church. (Kaplow, Cox News
Service).

   MEXICO-MILLENNIUM _ MEXICO CITY _ Mexicans are ringing in the
new millenium with the same cultural clashes and contradictions
they've lived with for 500 years. They are invited to attend their
local Catholic church for a night of prayer and devotion to Jesus
Christ, born 2000 years ago in a land the original Mexicans didn't
even know existed until the 1500s. Or _ among other bashes _ they
can rock and roll at the hulking Teotihuacan pyramids near Mexico
City and commune with their indigenous roots. Developing. (Ferriss,

   w/MEXICO-Y2K _ WASHINGTON _ Mexico is one of America's closest
trading partners and its immediate neighbor. Because of tight
trading links, Mexico is nearly on par with the United States and
Canada, in terms of Y2K readiness. The coordination of Y2K efforts
among Canada, Mexico and the US helps show how much NAFTA has knit
the three countries together into one big market. (Geewax, Atlanta

   CAMPAIGN-POLLS _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Candidates in the 2000 election
will face increasingly skeptical voters who are growing less
tolerant of attack ads and dishonesty on the campaign trail, a
research group with ties to Ohio said Thursday. In a nation-wide
poll done in early November, the Institute for Global Ethics found
nearly 60 percent of those polled think all or most candidates
``twist the truth'' while campaigning. Almost 40 percent said most
candidates lie. The latest figures come from a group that used Ohio

 (For release Sunday, December 19, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In August 1903, a 14-year-old girl burned down a barn in
Poughkeepsie, NY. Nobody died, but the fire caught the attention of
an editorial writer at the The New York Evening Journal who blamed
the fire on the fact that the child craved a little excitement
because she had been raised in . . . an orphanage.
</P>
<P>
   If the girl were returned to her institution for her crimes, the
editorialist wrote, ``She will go back to a scheme of life which is
largely the cause of her disordered cravings, a kind of life that
ruins with its dull routine hundreds of thousands of children.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a big asylum, no matter how good the intention of the
management, or how kind the attendants, the lives of the
unfortunate children are dull beyond belief. Everything is routine,
commonplace, dead-level monotony. They all sleep in uniform little
beds side by side, they get up, go to bed, eat, walk _ do
everything in one monotonous routine. And worst of all nothing is
left to their own initiative, their imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   The moral? According to the editorialist, nothing to do but to
abolish the orphanage and build some other, kinder, gentler system.
Such as? Such as the system that even then rapidly was evolving
into the program of federal assistance to mothers and their
children that eventually came to be known as Aid to Families with
Dependent Children (AFDC) or, in the political argot of the '90s,
Welfare As We Know It.
</P>
<P>
   That story is from ``Building the Invisible Orphanage: A
Prehistory of the American Welfare System,'' by Matthew A. Crenson,
a professor of political science at the Johns Hopkins University. I
consulted the book after reading stories about the blaze in
Worcester that killed six firefighters who had gone into an
abandoned warehouse to look for homeless people -- and about the
argument between two homeless people that led to the fire in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   Homelessness is an issue in New York City, too. Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani has ordered police to begin arresting street persons who
decline to go to a shelter or a hospital. His city has the nation's
largest, but far from only workfare program; fully 10 percent of
those on its welfare rolls are now performing low-skill city jobs.
Indeed, ever since President Clinton signed the welfare act in 1996
handing most of the responsibility for welfare programs back to the
states, it has been clear that things changed -- if not exactly
how.
</P>
<P>
   The virtue of Crenson's book is that it is a close examination
of the sea change that brought the welfare system into existence in
the first place. It is, in the historian Barbara Tuchman's phrase,
``a distant mirror'' of the present day. ``This is not the first
time Americans have scrapped a system of public assistance long in
use for another largely untried,'' writes Crenson. Impoverished
children always have been a part of the landscape; it was tensions
and disappointments associated with the orphanage system that gave
rise to the modern welfare system.
</P>
<P>
   Orphanages expanded rapidly in the decades after the Civil War
to accommodate large numbers of street children in the increasingly
populous and newly industrializing Northern cities. Gradually they
undertook to rescue poor children from almshouses and slums as
well. Most were private, sectarian institutions. A vigorous
competition set in among Protestant denominations and the Roman
Catholic Church over the proper tending of young souls.
</P>
<P>
   Child care was an expensive business, however, and by the 1870s,
the states were paying substantial subsidies to many orphanages.
With courts and county poorhouses making referrals, regulation by
the state became a necessity, and state supervision of religious
stewardship produced a constant rub. The organizational superiority
of the Catholic Church gave its essentially private system a
significant edge.
</P>
<P>
   Orphanages were developing bad reputations, however, for
stifling the good and furthering the bad. As in prisons, protecting
the innocent was possible, but even more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Crenson shows, the state sought ways of
implementing what we today call ``de-institutionalization.'' Almost
alone among the states, Massachusetts relied entirely on ``placing
out'' _ paying foster families to take in homeless children. But
that was expensive, too, and had perils of its own. So reformers
settled on the idea of ``mothers' pensions'' as the best solution
to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   It was risky putting cash in the hands of indigent mothers in
order to enable them to keep their children, but ``for the sake of
innocent children, welfare policy should accommodate the failings
of their parents'' _ or so the argument went, Crenson writes. Not
only was the ``invisible orphanage'' cheaper _ today we would call
the orphanage ``virtual'' _ but it appealed to both Catholics and
Protestants as well. Thirty years and the Great Depression were
required before the federal government accepted responsibility for
the program from the pioneering states.
</P>
<P>
   Thus it was the magnitude of American charity _ not just the
underdevelopment of the American state _ that helped delay the
emergence of a comprehensive welfare system, Crenson says. Others,
notably Harvard sociologist Theda Skocpol, have argued that
feminist activism was the galvanizing force. That analaysis pays
too little attention to the role of the churches, Crenson says, and
as a result fails to explain why welfare ``never moved far from
considerations of sin, redemption and salvation.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenson is rather bleak in his views about the policy that is at
the heart of the 1966 welfare act _ Congress' decision to back away
from the grand conception of social policy ratified in the 1930s in
favor of a period of decentralized social experimentation. To my
ear the news is fairly reassuring. Most of it comes from Jason
DeParle, an extraordinary reporter for the New York Times Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   There is an awful lot of misery out there, as he makes clear.
And backing away from one system before another is devised may make
it worse for a time. We've undertaken to re-work our main safety
net at a time when the economy is booming. It will go harder than
usual on the poor if and when things turn sour.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is hard not to be intrigued by the manner in which
several states have begun to to rewrite the web of expectations
loosely known as ``the social contract.'' Wisconsin in particular
has used its block grants _ lump-sum payments on a per capita basis
from the Federal government _ to ``construct a safety net not
around a check but around a job,'' DeParle writes. And a universal
work (itals)requirement(unitals) can easily be seen as a universal
(itals)right(unitals) to work. So in the end the main effect of
welfare reform in a post-industrial society may be to establish the
states as employers of last resort.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of an alternating cycle between centralization and
pluralism in American politics has been a fact of life at least
since Henry Adams first enunciated it more than a century ago in
his ``History of the United States During the Administrations of
Jefferson and Madison.'' Maybe something of what was lost with the
orphanage can be reclaimed. What I wish this holiday season is that
there was a little less dot.com and a little more examination of
the issues.

&HT;     FAITH IN GOD HELPS COWBOY FIND REBIRTH ON THE FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TOM ORSBORN  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Seven months ago, Alonzo Spellman sat on the
edge of his bed one night and wondered how life became so painful.
</P>
<P>
   ```It was like, `Man, what's next?''' said Spellman, remembering
what he calls the lowest point of his life.
</P>
<P>
   It was at that moment that everything became brighter, his
worries faded and his road to recovery began.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when God walked into my life and said, `I'm what's
next, because you don't have a what's next.' Everything else
changed from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it did. Instead of making headlines for being involved in
one bizarre incident after another, the former first-round draft
pick starts at defensive tackle for the Dallas Cowboys and is
playing some of the best football of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has done a tremendous job of turning things around in his
life,'' Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said, ``and we are the
beneficiaries of that.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just the Cowboys who are benefiting from Spellman's
rejuvenation. Texas advocates for mental health believe his
well-documented struggles with bipolar disorder will help others
who suffer from manic depression understand they can lead
productive lives.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Mental Health Association, bipolar
disorder is a mental illness that involves episodes of serious
mania and depression. At least 2 million Americans suffer from
bipolar disorder, which some researchers believe is caused by a
biochemical imbalance.
</P>
<P>
   ``His story is a survivor's story, a story of triumph and
hope,`` said Ray Kenny, president of the Mental Health Association
of Greater San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a story of faith and the power of prayer, two things
Spellman believes were the tools that helped him rebuild his life.
</P>
<P>
   Happiness was all Spellman knew after the Chicago Bears drafted
him with the 22nd overall pick in 1992. Blessed with a
muscle-bound, 6-foot-4, 290-pound body, he appeared to be well on
his way to an outstanding career in the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   But he made a wrong turn in his spiritual life when he left Ohio
State after his junior season. Instead of staying connected to his
family and church, he drifted away from his emotional anchors and
adopted a lifestyle that included fathering three children out of
wedlock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming up, the only thing I focused on in my life was my
family and Christ,'' said the native of Mount Holly, N.J. ``That's
the reason I made it out of the ghetto and became a first-round
pick. But then after I had my success _ first-round pick, big
contract _ I stepped away and started thinking it was more about me
than it was about (God), and he had to chop me back down.''
</P>
<P>
   Spellman, who recorded 31 sacks for Chicago between 1992 and
1997, missed nine games in 1997 with a shoulder injury. The Bears
eventually suspended him for three contests when he refused to
undergo arthroscopic surgery. After an angry confrontation with
then-Bears coach Dave Wannstedt, Spellman told the team he was
retiring.
</P>
<P>
   What followed was a series of bizarre incidents in the spring
and summer of 1998 that may have been caused by bipolar disorder
and that most certainly put his life in danger.
</P>
<P>
   In March, he found himself in a standoff with a police SWAT unit
after he barricaded himself in the home of his publicist. He was in
the house for eight hours before former Bears linebacker Mike
Singletary talked him out.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Spellman kicked open the door of his hospital room
and was later found walking the frozen streets of Chicago without a
shirt or shoes.
</P>
<P>
   In April, his 16-month marriage ended in divorce. In June, the
Bears cut him with two years left on his contract. That same month,
he was arrested and charged on a felony weapons count in Michigan
and received a face full of pepper spray from the police in an
altercation at a Detroit hotel
</P>
<P>
   In July, he was evicted from his suburban Chicago home. Two
months later, the police found him asleep in his car as it raced
down the fast lane of an interstate highway.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, as his nightmare year drew to a close, Spellman asked
God for relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prayed every day for God to give me an answer, to talk to
me, to help me, some how, some way,'' said Spellman, 28.
</P>
<P>
   Help from a higher power finally arrived this past May while he
sat alone in the bedroom of his Chicago home.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I did next was cry,'' he said. ``I fell on my knees and
started praying.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, he felt like a great weight had been lifted from his
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a feeling you can't really explain,'' he said. ``I just
couldn't stop the tears from coming out of my eyes. It's a very
releasing feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   s he prayed daily, good things started to happen, he said. He
renewed his relationship with his mother, Dorothy Spellman _ she
has the ``faith of a giant,'' he says _ and got a phone call from
Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys cornerback, himself a born-again Christian, decided
to reach out to Spellman after seeing him interviewed on
television. Always on the lookout for peers he can aid spiritually,
Sanders believed that, deep down, Spellman wasn't a bad person.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a difference between a guy causing problems and a guy
with problems,'' Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Spellman: ``If it wasn't for Deion, I probably wouldn't be
here in Dallas. He's got all my respect. He's not just a Hall of
Famer. He's an incredible person. He had a huge impact on my
comfort level when I came here.''

</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After establishing a relationship with Spellman, Sanders told
Cowboys owner Jerry Jones about his new friend. In need of
defensive-line help, Jones immediately began doing his homework on
Spellman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry established a very good relationship with Alonzo's
mom,'' said former Cowboys running back Calvin Hill, who works as a
consultant for the team's Player Assistance and Development
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a saying that good fruit falls off good trees, and I
think Jerry knew what kind of stock Alonzo came from. Jerry
deserves all the credit for Alonzo coming here.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones had Hill and other club officials learn all they could
about bipolar disorder and develop a program to help Spellman.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got everything answered that we wanted answered, it
didn't take me 30 seconds to make up my mind,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones finally signed Spellman on July 29 to a one-year deal
worth the veteran minimum of $400,000. The contract also includes
incentives worth $450,000.
</P>
<P>
   Playing like a man who has a new lease on life, Spellman has
recorded 39 tackles, five sacks, one forced fumble, one fumble
recovery and a team-high 18 quarterback pressures.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really helped our team tremendously,'' said Gailey, who
believes Spellman should receive consideration for a Pro Bowl
berth.
</P>
<P>
   Spellman credits God for his stellar play.
</P>
<P>
   ``My spirit is reborn in Christ, and that's why my game is
reborn,'' he said. ``If I wouldn't have come back to Christ and
been really committed to him, I wouldn't be able to do the things
I'm doing now.''

AFTER 33 YEARS, A FAREWELL TO BUCKLEY'S `FIRING LINE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even many of the guests who turned out at the Museum
of Broadcasting on Tuesday to pay tribute to William F. Buckley Jr.
on the occasion of the taping of the final broadcast of ``Firing
Line,'' his weekly program, might be forgiven for being surprised
that it was still on the air.
</P>
<P>
   After 33 years, ``Firing Line,'' the longest-running program in
television history with the same host, had long since lost its
buzz, having been supplanted by many other programs in which
outspoken conservative commentators hold forth. But to chroniclers
of Buckley's life and the conservative movement, ``Firing Line''
was the first and the most important in widely establishing
conservatism as a serious intellectual movement in America
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the program played a critical role in Buckley's signal
achievement: almost singlehandedly ``dekooking'' a conservative
movement widely identified in the 1950s and '60s with
isolationists, protectionists and bigots and catapulting it into
the mainstream of U.S. politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was opposing the hegemony of liberalism on the outside
looking in,'' said George H. Nash, the historian and author of
``The Conservative Intellectual Movement in America Since 1945''
(Intercollegiate Studies Institute, 1996). ``What `Firing Line'
represents is the opening of the door from the outside to the
inside.''
</P>
<P>
   After the landslide defeat of Barry Goldwater, the movement's
standard-bearer, in the 1964 presidential campaign, prominent
liberals like John Kenneth Galbraith declared that conservatism had
no place in U.S. politics.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley, now 74, was already well known as the defiant author of
``God and Man at Yale,'' the founder of the conservative weekly
National Review and an insurgent New York City mayoral candidate
when ``Firing Line'' first went on the air in April 1966. But the
program quickly took his celebrity to a new level, transforming him
into a cultural icon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buckley became best known not as a writer or speaker but as a
television performer,'' wrote John B. Judis in his 1988 biography,
``William F. Buckley: Patron Saint of the Conservatives.''
``Television was the medium through which he projected his own
views and personality onto the canvas of the '60s.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Firing Line'' is also seen as having blazed the trail for the
current wave of pugilistic punditry on television. The idea for a
weekly program in which Buckley would debate a liberal opponent for
an hour was first proposed by an executive at RKO, which owned
WOR-TV in New York. Buckley jumped at the chance to present his
conservative views to a wider audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot that had been said by National Review that
needed to be said face to face to its critics,'' Buckley recalled
in an interview on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning, Buckley, who was a skilled debater from his
student days at Yale, set out to eviscerate his opponents. Judis
wrote that Neal Freeman, Buckley's personal assistant at the time,
modeled the program after the Friday night fights that were then
nationally televised.
</P>
<P>
   The guest on the first ``Firing Line'' was Norman Thomas, the
Socialist and perennial presidential candidate who was 81 and
losing his eyesight. ``When you argue with a man who is old and
blind, you are pretty tough,'' said Warren Steibel, producer and
director of ``Firing Line'' since its early days. But, he added,
``it made good theater.''
</P>
<P>
   And good television. Buckley drove liberal viewers around the
bend by defending Sen. Joseph McCarthy, tarring his guests as
Communists and questioning such liberal orthodoxy as universal
voting rights in the South. With his tousled hair, blue eyes that
tended to bulge like an exotic lizard's, portentous vocabulary and
halting patrician speech, he quickly established himself as the
face of a new kind of conservatism: intelligent, urbane, witty,
cutting.
</P>
<P>
   By today's standards of political discourse it is hard to
imagine what ``Firing Line'' was like in the late 1960s and early
'70s, Judis said. ``Those shows were an extension of politics,'' he
said. ``They would not just comment on this spectator sport of
politics we have now. They were part of the political debate. That
is why ``Firing Line'' was interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckley was ripe for parody. Like the sportscaster Howard
Cosell, he became a man many viewers detested but could not stop
watching. ``I think you are finally going to displace me as the
most hated man in America,'' novelist Norman Mailer wrote to
Buckley after ``Firing Line'' took off. ``And of course the
position is bearable only if one is No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   After a few years, Buckley mellowed, becoming more generous to
his guests while losing little of his passion. (Judis wrote that
Buckley was so nasty that the program had trouble attracting guests
after its first year but Buckley and Steibel have denied this.) As
a result, his image began to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``He added a kind of charisma and sexiness to conservatism that
had never been there before,'' said Sam Tanenhaus, a contributing
editor at Vanity Fair who is preparing a biography of Buckley.
Young women flocked to him after his public appearances. The
feminist Germaine Greer flirted with him on camera. A 1973 study in
Psychology Today found that many women fantasized about Buckley
during intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Firing Line'' became a necessary stop for the leading liberal
figures of the era. Muhammad Ali, Allen Ginsberg, Jesse Jackson,
William M. Kunstler and Murray Kempton, among others, all made
appearances. Buckley was helped by the fact that he counts liberals
like Galbraith and Ira Glasser, executive director of the American
Civil Liberties Union, among his closest friends.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By putting Buckley alongside liberal celebrities, his
conservative views were given equal weight at a time when few
people took conservatives seriously and there were many fewer
outlets on television than there are today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody said I am going to apostatize as a result of seeing
`Firing Line,''' Buckley said, using one of his trademark $5 words.
``The challenge of conservatives in those years was not to convert
others to our point of view but to convince them that conservative
views weren't held by savages.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Firing Line'' retained its clout throughout the 1970s but its
influence, as well as that of National Review and Buckley's
syndicated column, began to wane after Ronald Reagan was elected
president in 1980. While Reagan called Buckley, his longtime ally,
``the most influential journalist and intellectual in our era,''
his victory occurred alongside the ascendance of a new generation
of conservative pundits like the columnist George Will.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley said that there was no particular pressure on him to
discontinue ``Firing Line,'' which was cut back to a half-hour from
an hour in the mid-1980s. But since the program had to end
sometime, he said, it might as well be at the end of the
millennium. He said he planned to continue writing his column and
books. The last ``Firing Line,'' which is the second installment of
a two-part retrospective, will be distributed to 294 PBS stations
on Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
   It seems unlikely that any conservative commentator will soon
reproduce the influence that Buckley and ``Firing Line'' had at
their peak. ``He had tremendous intelligence and wit,'' Judis said
of Buckley. ``That is a quality that is not necessarily valued now
on television. It takes time to debate someone. You don't do it in
a minute while the viewer goes from channel to channel.''

   Temperatures plummeted to minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit on Friday
morning at International Falls, Minn., as an Arctic air mass
continued to numb the upper Midwest. Saturday, the Arctic air will
retreat north into Canada as its high pressure center shifts east
and gives way to a low pressure system approaching from Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   South of this ``Alberta Clipper,'' a disturbance, which Friday
came ashore in the Pacific Northwest, will produce snow in the
northern Rockies early Saturday morning. Snow will taper to snow
showers as the disturbance moves eastward.
</P>
<P>
   In its wake, winds averaging 20 mph to 30 mph _ with gusts to 40
mph or more _ will develop east of the mountains in Montana and
Wyoming. Ahead of the disturbance, winds from the west-northwest
could exceed 40 mph across eastern Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a fresh Arctic air mass amassing in western Canada
will invade the high plains Saturday night across eastern Montana,
northeast Wyoming and the western Dakotas, accompanied by gusty,
frigid winds from the northwest. Winds gusts of more than 30 mph
are likely, adding a bitter bite to the already frigid air.
</P>
<P>
   A wet disturbance, which Friday moved over portions of Oklahoma
and the southern Plains will produce broken areas of cool rain
across parts of the central Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   A chilly Canadian high pressure system will build into the
Northeast on Saturday. On its southern flank, a swath of low clouds
will cover northern parts of the Middle Atlantic states, although
very little, if any, precipitation will fall from these clouds.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: SIBERIAN INVASION
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, temperatures dipped below minus 50 degrees
Fahrenheit at the Russian town of Vitim along the southern fringes
of Siberia as an infamously frigid Siberian high, with a central
barometric pressure of 31.33 inches of mercury, settled over the
region. In winter, Siberia lays claim to breeding the northern
hemisphere's coldest air masses. When winds blow across the North
Pole, frigid air masses born in Siberia invade North America. Next
week, a ``cross-polar flow'' of Siberian air will aim at the
northeastern quadrant of the nation, setting the stage for a bitter
Christmas Eve.

THE SANTA DEBATE GROWS NASTY
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Monday, Dec. 20)  
(mk) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every year, around this time, people divide into two camps:
Those who subscribe to the magic ``reindeer-dust'' theory and those 
flying-reindeer/fat-Santa/gifts-for-all-the-good-little-boys-and-gir
ls who believe that a 353,430-ton payload traveling at 650 miles
per second through the atmosphere would absorb approximately 14.3
quintillion joules of energy, per second, per reindeer, turning the
whole festive, holiday wad into a flaming charcoal briquette in
something like four-thousandths of a second.
</P>
<P>
   The two camps, needless to say, do not get along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disbeliever!'' hiss the magic-dusters to the
charcoal-briquetters.
</P>
<P>
   ``English major!'' retort the briquetters.
</P>
<P>
   The passion with which both sides defend their viewpoints
reminds one of the evolution/creationism debate, only with caribou
instead of monkeys. (School boards don't have to deal with the
controversy since the subject is Christmas-related and therefore
off-limits. However, free birth-control for flying reindeer can be
obtained in some school clinics, with or without a note from a
parent.)
</P>
<P>
   Politicians are either reluctant to take a side in the debate
for fear of losing votes or else simply ``don't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the editor, Dan Quayle said he believes
``raindear'' are destroying family values because in every cartoon
and comic book he's ever seen, Rudolph isn't wearing any clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Caught off-guard in an ``ambush'' interview by Don Imus, George
W. Bush confused Santa Claus with the prime minister of India.
</P>
<P>
   Adroitly side-stepping the locomotion question altogether, Al
Gore said he is a ``friend'' of all endangered species, including
flying reindeer, and would be proud to pose with some as long as
Bill Clinton's not in the picture.
</P>
<P>
   A visibly angry John McCain said he was tortured by flying
reindeer in a Hanoi prisoner-of-war camp and proceeded to punch the
interviewer in the face.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this, most, if not all, of the serious discussion on
this topic takes place between the magic-dusters and
charcoal-briquetters themselves. The debate has been going on for
many years with little or no new ground being plowed. The
briquetters, many of whom have crew-cuts and wear Drew Carey-style
eyeglasses, challenge their rivals to produce ``a single gram'' of
magic reindeer-dust. (Not surprisingly, the briquetters are big
fans of the metric system.) When they are feeling especially mean,
they compare magic reindeer-dust to trickle-down economics and
Nixon's ``secret plan'' to get us out of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The magic-dusters, who lean more toward the Jewel look (a look
that works much better for women than it does for men, by the way),
counter that magic reindeer-dust is not something you can scoop out
of a wooden bin in a health-food store like so much St. John's wort
or ginko biloba. It is produced exclusively by Santa Claus, only on
Christmas Eve, and only in sufficient quantities to sprinkle on the
heads of the eight tiny reindeer so that they can fly invisibly at
the speed of light, or slightly faster, depending on wind
conditions and how many boys and girls have been good that year. It
is not available commercially, and even if it were, it would not
allow you to fly because it would be out of date.(The magic-dusters
concede that it might be useful in treating mild cases of anxiety
or constipation, but prefer to stick to the main issue.)
</P>
<P>
   But the most persuasive argument the magic-dusters have going
for them is this: If Santa and his sleigh and his reindeer and his
toys and goodies for all the good little boys and girls of the
world were reduced to a flaming charcoal briquette by atmospheric
friction, then how is it that the presents get delivered year after
year after year?
</P>
<P>
   The briquetters, who might have said NASA before the crash of
the second Mars probe, are still searching for an answer.

A CULTURE OF BOTH LUCK AND PLUCK 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: N.J., Pa.)  (Eds: 1st three grafs should be set in italics.) 
(DW) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I know what you're thinking. Did he fire six shots or only
five? Well, to tell you the truth, in all the excitement, I kind of
lost track myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Dirty Harry, scowling, a last bite of hot dog still tucked into
his cheek, holds a long-barreled revolver on a wounded robber,
prostrate on the sidewalk, whose own gun is just inches from his
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, seeing as how this is a .44 magnum, the most powerful
handgun in the world, I guess you've got to ask yourself one
question: Do I feel lucky? Well, do you, punk?''
</P>
<P>
   There it is, in a nutshell, in Don Siegel's 1971 Clint Eastwood
thriller. The forces of moral order playing a cruel game of chance
with an antisocial representative of the culture of luck. That
fault line runs through the heart of American history, says Jackson
Lears, a historian at Rutgers University who is writing a cultural
history of luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I believe that we have this dominant culture, a
culture of control, which emphasizes technical mastery over one's
fate through systematic achievement and personal moral
responsibility, whose view of luck is that you make your own
luck,'' said Lears, best known for ``Fables of Abundance,'' his
1994 cultural history of advertising, and ``No Place of Grace,''
his 1981 history of anti-modernist criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where we get our ideals of the self-made man and a lot
of our success mythology. Yet even Horatio Alger realized that luck
is as important as pluck. Look back at these classic tales of
American success, and you will find that the key event in every
young hero's rise to respectability is a fortuitous event that is
beyond his control, the intervention of a wealthy benefactor at a
crucial moment or saving an innocent heiress from Bowery toughs.''
</P>
<P>
   Think of it as two threads that run through American history _
two ways of seeing the world _ and that America, as we understand
it, is impossible without the continuous interplay between them. On
one side there is the scrupulous ant, on the other the
devil-may-care grasshopper; or, speaking in a more American idiom,
the risk-taking cattlemen of the wide open range versus the
fence-building farmers. While the ants, the dominant culture, see
the world as a place that rewards the prepared and the
hard-working, the grasshoppers see it also as a place governed by
sheer dumb luck, where something like grace and magic can play as
large a role in individual destiny as keeping your nose to the
grindstone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The common practice of wishing someone good luck is not a
matter of suggesting that they are incompetent,'' wrote Nicholas
Rescher, a philosophy professor at the University of Pittsburgh, in
``Luck: The Brilliant Randomness of Everyday Life,'' published in
1995, ``but rather reflects our realization that competence alone
is not enough to secure success in a chancy world _ that there is
always the prospect that even the best possible effort may not meet
with the success it deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   Though many of the same themes are played out in other cultures,
it is particularly strong in American culture, Lears says. ``I'm
pretty committed to the idea that we have certain unifying themes
that we can characterize as constitutive of American culture,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Luck seems to be one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Alexis de Tocqueville understood this. ``What you find in his
work and a lot of other commentators on early American economic
history is the fascination with risk, the sheer excitement of it,
the fascination with intense experience as an end in itself,''
Lears said. ``We have a culture that can both celebrate and deny
luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Main Street sings America's song, but so does Las Vegas
Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   If someone strikes it rich, if he gets that promotion, if the
horse or the stock he picks carries the day, then it is simply his
just reward for the hard work and preparation that he put into it.
But there is also that American soft spot for the person who goes
over the far mountain into the wild unknown, who buys a lottery
ticket even though he knows that it's a sucker bet, who bungee
jumps off a cliff and is willing to put everything on the line,
well beyond reason, for the downright thrill of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning is a big thing in our culture _ a fist in the air, an
archetype, the late-20th-century American gesture,'' wrote
Frederick and Steven Barthelme in ``Double Down,'' their recent
memoir about how they squandered their inheritance in Gulf Coast
casinos. ``Winning is everything, many have said. In that word
there is a magic release from the weight of all those nagging, dull
concerns you're accustomed to carrying.''
</P>
<P>
   A magic release.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the culture of chance, the recognition that there are
in fact important forces beyond our control that shape our
destinies and that this is a powerful countercorrective that runs
against the dominant mythology of the self-made man,'' Lears said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Auster, in his 1990 novel, ``The Music of Chance,'' has one
of his characters describe it in a slightly different way. ``It's
as though God has singled us out from other men,'' says the
character, a rich gambler, explaining a long winning streak. ``He's
showered us with good fortune and lifted us to heights of
happiness. I know this might sound presumptuous to you, but at
times I feel that we've become immortal.''
</P>
<P>
   All through American history there is celebration of
risk-takers, from the pioneers to the day-traders, existing side by
side with the proponents of hard work and making money the
old-fashioned way. What is particularly interesting, Lears says, is
that while there has been ebb and flow in the relative strengths of
these opposing worldviews over the centuries, the champions of luck
have been resurgent lately, as shown by the explosive growth in
gambling, the risk-embracing entrepreneurial ethos championed by
Ronald Reagan and the recent day-trading phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Fabian, a cultural historian whose 1990 book ``Card Sharps
and Bucket Shops: Gambling in 19th-Century America,'' has just been
rereleased in paperback, agrees that the gambling boom is mirrored
in such enthusiasms as day-trading. ``You can't think of these
attitudes on luck and gambling as divorced from other attitudes
toward economics and culture,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   What is interesting in the current risk boom, Ms. Fabian said,
is that it involves a much wider swath of the community. ``It used
to be that gambling was an activity for the very rich and the very
poor,'' she said. ``But now it is reaching a much larger segment of
the population, into the middle class.''

</P>
<P>
   As Lears looked more closely at this culture of luck, the more
he was able to see American history as a kind of battle between
these two opposing worldviews. Before the 1820s, he said, the
culture of chance was ascendant, with popular philosophers of the
time talking about Fortuna, the old Roman goddess of luck, and
about the mutability of fate and unpredictability of life.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1820s, with the rise of evangelical Protestantism, the
culture of control asserted itself, crusading against gambling and
promoting moral and business principles. During and immediately
after the Civil War, when it became painfully clear how large a
role chance played in who lived and who died, there was a
resurgence in interest in luck, but by the turn of the century,
with monopolists trying to control chance in the economy and social
reformers trying to mute its effect in the ghettos, the culture of
control was again ascendant.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s and '30s, gamblers were either objects of menace,
as in James Cagney movies, or faintly ridiculous, as they were in
Damon Runyon stories. ``Those guys in the Runyon stories inhabit a
specific universe that exemplifies the culture of chance,'' Lears
said. ``Everybody talks in the present tense, there is an ethos of
not hoarding, of reckless generosity, of no thought for the
morrow.'' Efforts were made in these years to harness chance, both
in business (the rise of market research) and in science. This
cultural mood persisted into the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Job security is a reality for much of the population in that
period,'' Lears said. ``My favorite example of the mind-set of the
period is the slogan that Roy Rogers always had at the end of his
television program: `Be brave, but don't take chances.' That sort
of self-canceling advice epitomized the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   It is in the mid-1960s, with the institution of the first state
lottery and, 10 years later, the expansion of gambling to Atlantic
City, N.J., and then elsewhere, that the culture of chance began
its current rise. Suddenly, gangsters in ``The Godfather'' were
equated with businessmen and a risk-loving,
get-rich-while-you're-young ethos supplanted the stodgy old coots
in their smoke-filled clubs.
</P>
<P>
   In the '80s and into the '90s, job security was no longer the
norm. Fear and uncertainty entered the marketplace and the American
home, and the difference between speculation and investment got
murkier and murkier. ``One of the phrases that strikes me as
particularly revealing in marking the re-emergence of the culture
of chance is the whole idea of the contingent labor force,'' Lears
said. Once again people became interested in finding ways to
understand and perhaps even govern chance. ``Even chaos theorists
are interested in locating patterns in the chaos,'' Lears said.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, the battle lines sometimes got harder to
determine.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Dirty Harry,'' the prostrate robber declines to reach for
his gun and Harry pulls the trigger with a smirk. Click. An empty
chamber. Then, at the end of the movie, another criminal finds
himself in the same position. ``Do you feel lucky, punk?'' This one
grabs for his gun and Harry pulls the trigger. Blam! One dead
criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Harry knew each time whether there was a bullet in the
chamber. Maybe the culture of control won the day over the culture
of chance through perseverance, hard work and determination.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe he was just lucky.

$5.2 BILLION COMPENSATION PLAN APPROVED FOR NAZI-ERA WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ American and German officials formally agreed Friday on
a $5.2 billion plan to compensate surviving slave workers and other
victims of the Nazi era.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to heal old wounds as well as resolve several
class-action suits against German companies, President Johannes Rau
punctuated the financial agreement with a moving apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pay tribute to all those who were subjected to slave and
forced labor under German rule, and, in the name of Germany, beg
forgiveness,'' Rau said. ``Their suffering will not be forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement covers far more than former forced workers. It is,
in effect, a catchall agreement to settle all remaining disputes
and suits that involve the Nazi era.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement covers claims over ``Aryanization'' programs under
which German Jews were forced to sell their properties and their
businesses at low prices, often to the profit of German banks. It
also includes unpaid insurance claims owed by German insurers, and
it includes virtually all miscellaneous abuses such as those
stemming from medical experiments in concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the agreement is what amounts to a legal guarantee by
the U.S. government that it will oppose future suits against German
companies that involve the Nazi past.
</P>
<P>
   But even as negotiators hailed the agreement, reached after
nearly a year of bruising talks, officials braced for new and
potentially nasty fights over distributing the money.
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult and emotional issue is how to allocate the
money between slave workers, who were kept in concentration camps
and usually worked to their deaths, and forced laborers, who worked
against their will but received at least some pay and better
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   American officials estimate that 240,000 former slave workers
are alive, about half Jewish. Estimates of the number of forced
laborers range from 700,000 to 1.5 million, although some lawyers
say the total may be 2.3 million. Those survivors are scattered
across Central Europe and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Most negotiators agree in principle that slave workers should
receive more compensation. But there are major differences over how
much more. American officials are worried about conflicts between
American Jewish groups, who have played a pivotal political role
but represent a small minority of the victims, and groups that
represent forced workers, who are overwhelmingly non-Jewish, in
Poland, the Czech Republic, Belarus, Russia and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be very difficult and extremely emotional,'' predicted
Stuart Eizenstat, the U.S. deputy treasury secretary who mediated
on behalf of groups that demanded compensation from Germany. He
said survivors would not start receiving money for about a year.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.5 billion settlement that Swiss banks reached two years
ago over claims that stemmed from plundered gold and from dormant
bank accounts that belonged to Jewish Holocaust victims prompted
bitter battles among Jewish groups, class-action lawyers and other
groups involved in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Another uncertainty, though probably not a big problem, is where
the money will come from. In principle, the German government and
German industry will each contribute 5 billion marks, for a total
of $5.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But 70 companies have thus far pledged to contribute, and their
commitments fall well short of 5 billion marks. ``There is still a
big gap, but I feel confident we can fill it,'' said Manfred Gentz,
chief financial officer of DaimlerChrysler and leader of the
industry group.
</P>
<P>
   Gentz said the German subsidiary of General Motors, Adam Opel,
has in principle pledged to give money to the fund. The German unit
of Ford, Ford Werke, is expected to join, as well.
</P>
<P>
   In an executive agreement between the United States and Germany,
the American government will pledge itself to oppose suits. In case
of a Holocaust-related suit, Washington will file a standing
statement to urge the court to reject it.
</P>
<P>
   The statement will argue that the new fund should be the
``exclusive'' remedy for all Holocaust claims and that any new
suits would be against American interests.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether that will protect German companies
from litigation, given that American class-action suits have proven
to be formidable bargaining tools.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it is clear that German companies and the German
government, which has already paid out 60 billion marks, in
reparations since the end of World War II, are determined to make
this 10 billion marks their last payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten billion marks is a final amount,'' said Otto Lambsdorff,
the lead negotiator for German industry.

JAGUAR XKR: MORE POWER, MORE FUN, MORE MONEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. Chambers Williams III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   More power, more performance and more fun. More money, too.
</P>
<P>
   That sums up the 2000 Jaguar XKR, a new, speedier version of the
XK8 that was introduced in 1997. As Jag's flagship model, the XKR
carries a base price of $76,800 for the coupe and $81,800 for the
convertible, which we tested for this report.
</P>
<P>
   The extra power comes from supercharging the 4.0-liter AJ-V-8
engine in the XK8, raising the horsepower to 370 from 290, and the
torque to 387 foot-pounds from 284.
</P>
<P>
   I thought the XK8's 290 horsepower was plenty _ until I mashed
the accelerator on the XKR for the first time, and got a rush
somewhat like the feel of the Concorde supersonic jetliner speeding
down the runway on takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   Recognition of that supreme acceleration isn't limited to
adults. My 2-year-old granddaughter, Savanna, riding shotgun in her
safety seat, giggled out loud each time I briskly accelerated the
XKR. Already, she understands driving excitement; it must be in the
genes.
</P>
<P>
   With a specially modified Mercedes-Benz five-speed automatic
transmission, the XKR convertible goes from zero to 60 mph in 5.3
seconds (5.2 seconds for the coupe), making it the
fastest-accelerating Jaguar on the market. It's also one of the
fastest cars on the market.
</P>
<P>
   The XKR's appearance is distinguished from the XK8 by its
wire-mesh grille, functional hood louvers, deck-lid spoiler and
18-inch alloy wheels that come with Z-rated Pirelli tires.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, this car is gorgeous. The lines flow much more
smoothly than those of the XJ series, in effect giving the car a
more modernistic look. Still, the car is clearly a Jaguar, and that
was a primary goal in creating the XK series' design.
</P>
<P>
   I can't tell you this is the most practical car in the world.
The designers won out over the engineers, which makes the car look
better than it would have if the engineers had been allowed to give
it more head room, better outward visibility and a functional rear
seat.
</P>
<P>
   The XKR is hard to get into and out of, thanks in part to the
low roof line. Sitting in the driver's seat, the top of my head was
brushing the canvas roof _ an annoyance that is forgotten during
the brisk acceleration mentioned above.
</P>
<P>
   Handling is typically Jaguar. This is a rather big, heavy car to
be called a sports car, so it's not as nimble as some pure sports
cars. But for its size, the XKR's road-hugging abilities are
outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   The handling characteristics are aided by Jaguar's Computer
Active Technology Suspension, standard on the XKR. This system
provides automatic two-stage damping to ensure superior handling,
ride comfort and driver control. Cornering is further assisted by
the Servotronic II steering system, which varies the amount of
power-steering assist depending on the speed. At medium to high
speeds, this system reduces power-steering assist to keep the wheel
firmer.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-spoke alloy wheels were designed to aid performance, too.
They are 8 inches wide at the front of the car and 9 inches wide at
the rear. The Pirelli P Zero tires _ 245/45 at the front and 255/45
at the rear _ were specifically designed for the XKR to optimize
steering response and high-speed stability, Jaguar says.
</P>
<P>
   The twin hood louvers are used to help control the car at high
speeds. Midway between the nose and the windshield, the louvers
create a low-pressure zone to help draw air through the radiator,
as well as reducing aerodynamic lift in the front end. The small
spoiler lip on the edge of the trunk works in concert with the
louvers to balance the car for high-speed stability.
</P>
<P>
   Visibility from the driver's seat is limited by the narrow
windows, and with the top down, it's hard to see clearly to the
rear. We didn't get to drive with the top down very much, however,
because it was just too cold the week we had the XKR.
</P>
<P>
   The premium AM/FM/cassette stereo with trunk-mounted
compact-disc changer was a welcome feature. It's an outstanding
system worthy of a vehicle in this price range.
</P>
<P>
   The power controls for the driver's seat are rather hard to
reach. They are on the lower front edge of the side of the seat.
You really need to have the door open to work the controls
efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Once you are planted inside, the front bucket seats are rather
comfy. The rear seat is just for looks _ there is no leg room. You
could put a dog back there, but not much else. The trunk of the
convertible is rather small _ 9.5 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   Amenities abound, as you would imagine. Connolly leather seats
and burl walnut interior trim are standard, along with traction
control; heated seats; headlight washers/wipers; rain-sensing
windshield wipers; automatic headlights; power windows and door
locks; and remote-control locking/unlocking.
</P>
<P>
   Only one option is offered: a Global Positioning System-based
navigation system, with moving map mounted in the center of the
dash. This $2,400 system was included on our test car. There was
one serious problem with it, however: The screen is way too bright
at night _ so bright I had to turn it off. A similar system offered
in Lexus vehicles has a night setting that tones it down; without
that, the Jag system is more a nuisance than a help at night. There
was a setting on the Jag system for night driving, but it did not
lower the brightness.
</P>
<P>
   Total price of our test vehicle was $84,200.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings are 16 miles per gallon in the city and
22 on the highway for the convertible; 16 city/23 highway for the
coupe. The tank holds 19.9 gallons, and unleaded premium gasoline
is recommended.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   AT A GLANCE:
</P>
<P>
   2000 Jaguar XKR convertible
</P>
<P>
   THE PACKAGE: Premium, midsize, two-door, supercharged V-8
powered, rear-drive, high- performance convertible.
</P>
<P>
   HIGHLIGHTS: New for 2000 (in the United States; it has been on
sale in Europe for two years), the XKR is Jag's new flagship
vehicle. It comes in coupe and convertible versions, with more
power than any other Jaguar, great roadhandling and gorgeous
styling.
</P>
<P>
   NEGATIVES: Hard to get into and out of, head room and outward
visibility are limited, high price tag.
</P>
<P>
   MAJOR COMPETITORS: Mercedes-Benz SL.
</P>
<P>
   EPA FUEL ECONOMY: 16 mpg city/22 highway.
</P>
<P>
   BASE PRICE: $81,800.
</P>

   IRAQ-U.N. (United Nations) _ A divided Security Council voted
Friday to create a new arms inspection system for Iraq with the
promise to President Saddam Hussein that sanctions against his
country could be suspended within a year and eventually lifted if
he cooperates. The vote was 11 in favor and 4 abstentions. At the

A NIGHT OUT WITH BEN HEPPNER TACKLING TRISTAN, LOVING BUGS BUNNY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada)   (For release Sunday, Dec. 19.)  
(DW) 
 By JEREMY EICHLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Excuse me while I slip into something a bit more
flame-retardant,'' said Ben Heppner, the Canadian tenor who
concluded his role as Tristan in the Metropolitan Opera's sold-out
``Tristan und Isolde'' with Saturday's broadcast performance.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to fans at the Canadian Consulate in Manhattan on
Wednesday night, Heppner was quoting his own joke from other Wagner
operas he has performed around the world, many of which utilize
smoke or fire.
</P>
<P>
   Flame-retardant or otherwise, Heppner, 43, has become a
superhero in operatic circles. The role of Tristan is regarded as
the most punishing vocal part in the tenor repertory, and until
Heppner and his Isolde (the soprano Jane Eaglen) stepped up, the
Met had not produced the work in almost 16 years. Wagner fans, a
group not known for tepid opinions, greeted this production a bit
like die-hard football fans might greet a Super Bowl Sunday _ one
that had been delayed for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for being you!'' one man exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   A towering figure whose physique is proportional to his voice,
Heppner arrived in an elegant dark suit, a vest with lapels and
black leather pointed boots. Seventy-five guests _ a mixture of
proud Canadians and reverential Wagnerians _ whooped and applauded.
Nonetheless, the tenor looked exhausted; his performance the night
before began at 7 p.m. and ended after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am experiencing a good bit of Wagner lag,'' he confessed.
``It's like jet lag, except it's in German.''
</P>
<P>
   As the night wore on, Heppner seemed buoyed by the admirers
around him. The question among these fans was not whether one had
seen the new production, but whether one had made it to all seven
performances so far. (Several had.) One man said he had purchased a
new stereo system to record the international radio broadcast of
the final matinee, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these people know more about me than my children do,''
Heppner said.
</P>
<P>
   Then Heppner was whisked off with the Canadian consul general,
Michael Phillips, to Phillips' private residence on Park Avenue for
a dinner in Heppner's honor. In attendance were other Canadian
dignitaries, as well as officials from the Wagner Society of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Seated at a table resplendent with silver candlesticks,
variegated holly and mimosa plants, Heppner polished off six
courses that included chanterelle mushroom ravioli in tomato butter
and grilled sirloin of lamb with sunchoke and potato puree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have to watch what you eat?'' asked Ellen Wright, a
member of the Canadian delegation to the United Nations and the
wife of the deputy consul general, Dwayne Wright. ``Apparently
not,'' Heppner said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   There was chat around the table about Heppner's humble origins
in northern British Columbia and his love of limited-edition
acetate cells from the Warner Brothers cartoons of Bugs Bunny
singing opera. ``Kill the wabbit, kill the wabbit,'' Heppner sang
under his breath.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wright requested a real song, but Heppner demurred, saying,
``All my resources have been spent on Tristan.'' He added that he
would not even speak the next day in preparation for Saturday's
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Before slipping off, however, he surprised Ms. Wright by placing
his hands on her shoulders and singing for her the opening of a
love aria from Benjamin Britten's ``Peter Grimes.'' Ms. Wright
bubbled with excitement: ``He sang to me! Did everyone hear? He
sang to me!''

SOUTHERN DEMS STILL GO THEIR OWN WAY IN CONGRESS  
 SOUTHERN HOSTILITY TOWARD GAYS IN THE MILITARY

 GODFATHER OF SOUL LIKES STROM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: The South)  (mk) 
 By CARL HULSE and SEAN LOUGHLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Conservative Southern Democrats are fewer in
number, but they still manage to make their presence felt in
Congress by bucking the party line.
</P>
<P>
   A new analysis by Congressional Quarterly found that a handful
of Dixie Dems in both the House and Senate were among the most
likely to balk at the party's position on any number of issues.
John Breaux of Louisiana, for example, was the most rebellious
Democrat in the Senate, breaking with Democrats on 25 percent of
key votes, while his Louisiana colleague Mary Landrieu was third
with a 19 percent rating.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Democrat Virgil Goode of Virginia voted against
his party's position an astonishing 78 percent of the time to take
the rebel award. Other Southern Democrats who regularly broke ranks
included Reps. Bud Cramer of Alabama, who opposed his party on 47
percent of the votes; Chris John of Louisiana, also 47 percent; and
Mike McIntyre of North Carolina, 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the more conservative nature of their constituencies,
white Southern Democrats have historically tormented their party's
congressional leadership through their fractiousness. When
Democrats ran Congress, members of the party's Southern wing often
sided with minority Republicans to bottle up initiatives they
didn't like. Even with the GOP in charge, Southern independence is
having an impact.
</P>
<P>
   CQ's review found that the Blue Dog Coalition, a caucus that
includes many moderate and conservative Democrats from the South,
tipped the outcome on a handful of votes by siding with Republicans
_ including high-profile proposals on gun control and arts funding.
If a majority of the 30-member coalition had instead sided with
Democrats, the outcome would have been reversed.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine predicted that the feisty group could become even
more influential _ and pose a headache for Democratic leaders _ if
the party manages to win back the House in next year's election.
</P>
<P>
   DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL
</P>
<P>
   Democratic presidential candidates Al Gore and Bill Bradley,
battling for primary election voters, are advocating allowing
homosexuals to serve openly in the military, branding the
administration's existing policy a failure as evidenced by the
beating death of a gay soldier.
</P>
<P>
   While the position could have its appeal in the primary for the
two men, it could cost them later, particularly in the South. Many
in the region, which prides itself on military tradition and a
network of installations, reacted with open hostility to President
Clinton when he proposed ending a ban on gays serving within days
of assuming office in 1993. The fact that Clinton's record on the
draft was murky did not help matters.
</P>
<P>
   Southern lawmakers, including former Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia,
led the effort to try to retain the ban on gays though Nunn
eventually compromised. The unfolding campaign could show whether
sentiments have changed with the passage of time and the fact that
it is not Clinton advocating the change.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Looking to exploit a sympathetic political constituency, both
anti-tobacco advocates and cigarette manufacturers claim to be
looking out for the best interests of tobacco farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The rhetoric has heated up with a new report that details how
U.S. cigarette manufacturers have sharply curtailed their use of
home-grown tobacco over the past few decades, relying more on
foreign leaf.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Myers, incoming president of the Campaign for
Tobacco-Free Kids, said cigarette manufacturers invoke the plight
of farmers when they want to score some political points on Capitol
Hill, but at other times they focus on their bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cigarette manufacturers like to paint a picture of the
tobacco industry as one big happy family,'' Myers said. ``This
picture is a 20-year-old myth.'' The American Cancer Society and
the American Heart Association also sponsored the report.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette executives quibble with some details of the report,
but they concede that the move has been toward more foreign
tobacco. Mark Smith, a spokesman for Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco
Corp., said that his company has made a commitment to reverse that
trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in this together for the tobacco farmers,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   HE FEELS GOOD
</P>
<P>
   Long popular in his home state, Sen. Strom Thurmond, the
97-year-old Republican from South Carolina, has apparently found
new fans in the world of rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   In the millennium issue of Rolling Stone magazine, singer James
Brown, the godfather of soul, cited Thurmond as one of his heroes,
along with John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the young whippersnappers get out of line, whether
Democrat or Republican, an old man can walk up and say, `Wait a
minute, son, it goes this way.' And that's great for our country.
He's like a grandfather to me,'' Brown said of Thurmond. ``He's all
of our grandfathers.''

WITH MACAU ALMOST IN HAND, CHINA LOOKS TO TAIWAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ When China's leaders in Beijing look south at Macau,
which returns to Chinese sovereignty Sunday night, they do not see
a tiny island rife with casinos and bedeviled by crime.
</P>
<P>
   They see glorious destiny. They see the end of foreign
oppression. And, most importantly, they see a cause for hope that
the mainland will eventually annex Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Once Macau returns, ``the great endeavor of reunifying China
will take a big step forward,'' President Jiang Zemin said last
week. ``Under these circumstances, the task of resolving the Taiwan
issue'' will ``appear increasingly urgent.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the Chinese are going all-out this week to mark the
hand-over of Macau to China, after more nearly 450 years of
colonial rule by Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Although a new millennium arrives in less than two weeks, the
digital countdown clock that now graces Tiananmen Square marks the
seconds to Macau's return. This weekend, there will be a gala on
the square for 30,000 guests featuring fireworks and dragon dances.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, newspapers here are documenting in excruciating
detail the preparations of cities, old folks clubs and religious
groups. They have lovingly described the 600 potted lotuses donated
to Macau by the nearby Chinese city of Zhuhai, and the 12-foot-long
commemorative picture made using 14,000 pieces of fish bone by a
retiree in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese attach great importance to the return of Macau,
primarily for symbolic and political reasons,'' said Jia Qingguo,
an international relations professor at Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging Macau's chronic problem with crime, a
byproduct of the gambling that forms the base of its economy, he
said: ``To Chinese, these are practical issues that will be dealt
with between the Chinese government and the new special
administrative region of Macau. The far larger issue is that of
Chinese reunification and that has tremendous symbolic and
emotional value.''
</P>
<P>
   For centuries before the Communists took power in 1949, bits and
piece of China were taken over by Western nations and Japan, a
legacy that still rankles the Chinese. The return of tiny Macau is
viewed as proof of China's rejuvenated status in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that China is once again powerful,'' said a retired
railway conductor surnamed Liu who was out buying vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government clearly hopes that sentiments like these
will boost its popularity at a time of great economic uncertainty.
Still, it is linkage between the Macau hand-over and an eventual
reunification with Taiwan that has consumed China's leaders in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan, a Japanese colony from 1895 to 1945, became the seat of
the Chinese Nationalists after they lost the civil war to the
Communists in 1949 and is still considered a renegade province by
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   With the return of Macau assured, many leaders see Taiwan as the
missing piece of the China puzzle. And they hope that by applying
the ``One Country _Two Systems'' formula of relative autonomy to
Macau, as they have to Hong Kong since its return in 1997, they
will somehow convince Taiwan that reunification is workable.
</P>
<P>
   To help gin up popular enthusiasm, the government has declared a
holiday on Monday and state television will broadcast live from
Macau for the 48 hours surrounding the hand-over. But it is unclear
if the media blitz is having the desired effect.
</P>
<P>
   Many state companies have scheduled events, although in the
spirit of modern China, some are celebrating the return to the
Motherland and the arrival Father Christmas at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I'm happy because Macau is China's territory and
it's coming back,'' said Fu Xiaozhen, a fashionably dressed
26-year-old. ``My company is having a joint `return of Macau' and
Christmas party, since it's more convenient that way.''

 &HT;    Wall Street still positive on stock of Timber Co.
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Like seedlings in a pine forest, the stock price of
Georgia-Pacific's timber unit may take awhile to grow.
</P>
<P>
   While Timber Co. (ticker TGP) is up 21 percent from a 52-week
low of $19.87 1/2 low in February, the stock is down 75 cents from
its first day of trading two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts said the pulp and paper giant made the right
move in giving Timber Co. its own ticker symbol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timber Co. is going to be winner year-in and year-out with
cash flow,'' said Joshua Zaret, a timber analyst with Warburg
Dillon Read. ``Management has achieved everything they set out to
do. This is a stock that will come into its own when the (pulp and
paper) market gets a little more volatile and riskier,'' Zaret
said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific Chairman and Chief Executive Pete Correll
created a separate stock for the timber business to unlock the
market value hidden in 5 million acres of forest land _ most of it
pine trees in the Southeast. Unlike the cyclical swings of
Georgia-Pacific's main lines of business _ pulp, paper and building
products _ timber prices generally march upward.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to the current upswing in the paper side of the
business, timber is getting the short end of the stick on Wall
Street, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consensus is that paper earnings are going to rise fairly
dramatically over the next two years, while wood probably peaked
earlier this year,'' said Zaret. ``Most people are going to play
paper today instead of timber.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Georgia-Pacific Group shares are up 63 percent this
year. The stock closed Friday at $47.62 1/2, up 87 1/2 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific's creation of the letter stock raised some
eyebrows when it was first announced in 1997. Typically used to
ease acquisitions or ward off unwanted takeovers, letter stocks are
not common. By making the timber operations a separate unit with
control over its own profitability, Georgia-Pacific reasoned that
the two stocks would each trade at a higher price than if they
remained together.
</P>
<P>
   Timber Co. is also known as a tracking stock _ tied to part of a
parent company's operations and not a spinoff or independent
company.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the share price doesn't reflect Timber Co.'s
profitability. The company has consistently beat analysts'
estimates. Through the third quarter, Timber Co. reported profit of
$195 million, up 51 percent from the year-ago period. It's expected
to earn about $2.11 a share for the year, according to an average
of analysts' estimates by IBES.
</P>
<P>
   Given the company's performance and the price-per-acre in recent
timberland sales, some analysts have pegged the real value of
Timber Co.'s stock at $30 to $35 a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value is there, but the market isn't recognizing it, and
that's masking some of the Timber Co.'s benefits,'' said analyst
Chip Dillon of Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts contend that owning timberland is a good investment
over the long run. While the stock may be undervalued, investors
are getting compensated with steady dividends, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Through dividends and share repurchases, Timber Co. says it has
as returned $399 million to shareholders in the past seven
quarters. The company has repurchased nearly 11 million shares, or
12 percent of its outstanding stock, since it started trading
separately.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Cuernavaca, a city of gardens and golfers south of
Mexico City, is still dark at 5:30 a.m. when Mario Betancourt, an
executive with Pemex, the government oil company, crawls from bed
and noses his car into a line of other commuters heading toward
jobs in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuautla, another city south of the capital, Roberto Aguilar
boards a bus for his own two-hour trip to his Mexico City job
varnishing antique furniture.
</P>
<P>
   And at the same hour far to the north, in the city of Pachuca on
the other side of the vast capital, Javier Chavez, a computer
specialist, is beginning his daily drive to work at a Mexico City
cellular phone company.
</P>
<P>
   A new class of commuters has emerged in Mexico. A half-century
after Americans began to abandon cities for suburbs, thousands of
Mexicans are for the first time making a similar choice, fleeing
the pollution and clamor of Mexico City in search of quiet houses,
well-clipped lawns and safer streets in cities and towns hours
away.
</P>
<P>
   The commuters are bringing broad changes to the face of the
countryside for 100 miles on all sides of the capital. Land prices
throughout the suburban region are rising fast, and the few patches
of farm or forest land that remain near major highways are quickly
being bulldozed for strip malls and housing developments.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the commuters appear to be fueling economic
growth in dozens of towns and cities. Schools, hospitals and other
services in some suburban towns are being improved to meet
middle-class standards.
</P>
<P>
   The daily commute here offers more daunting challenges than
those faced by most straphangers and car-poolers in the United
States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic jams are horrendous. And the cost of parking, gasoline
and roadway tolls, which are among the highest in the world, can
drive the price of the daily commute by car to above $20 a day. As
a result, many professionals prefer to travel by bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very Mexican-style suburbanization process,'' said
Reina Corona Cuapio, an urbanologist at the National Autonomous
University who has conducted a survey that aims to provide the
first preliminary profile of Mexico's burgeoning commuter class.
``It's taking place with almost no governmental planning, and the
costs for commuters in time, money and inconvenience are high.''
</P>
<P>
   North of the border, commuters have been polled, profiled and
analyzed ever since the U.S. Census Bureau first included questions
about ``place of work and journey to work'' in the 1950 census. The
1990 census showed that 24 percent of all Americans now commute to
jobs in a county other than the one they live in.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Mexican commuters have never been systematically
counted, mainly because they have emerged in large numbers only
recently. Ms. Corona's survey counted commuters traveling from
Cuautla, 65 miles southeast of Mexico City, and she hopes to count
commuters in the entire metropolitan area in broader studies later.
</P>
<P>
   Based on calculations including revenues from highway tolls, she
estimated that as many as 500,000 people may be traveling each day
between the capital and six surrounding states. Probably a third of
them are workers commuting to jobs, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even cities as far away as San Juan del Rio, 102 miles north of
the capital, are being suburbanized, demonstrating Mexican workers'
tremendous patience for grueling daily travel.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilar, the furniture restorer, who is 67, spent one recent
month journeying by bus, subway and taxi to a job in a city far
north of Mexico City, 180 miles from his home in Cuautla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd leave home at 5 a.m. and get back at 11 p.m.'' Aguilar
said. ``But I didn't want to turn down the job.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of this century, Mexico City has been a powerful
magnet, attracting millions of peasants to its industries in one of
the world's most extraordinary farm-to-factory migrations. The
population of the Federal District, Mexico City's formal name,
quintupled between 1940 and 1980, to 8.8 million from 1.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   But early in this decade, experts studying Mexico's 1990 census
detected a startling reversal. For the first time, the city's
population declined in the 1980s, by about 600,000.
</P>
<P>
   The figures showed a corresponding growth in many mid-size
Mexican cities, leading some demographers to conclude that the
tremendous forces of centralization that governed Mexico for more
than a century had come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recently the process by which population has been
concentrating in Mexico City has been turned around,'' concluded a
1995 essay in the population journal Demos. Because of crime,
pollution and the high cost of living, ``the city is now expelling
rather than receiving migrants,'' the study said.
</P>
<P>
   But further study showed that many smaller cities like
Cuernavaca, Cuautla, Pachuca and Toluca that were showing rapid
growth were simply being transformed into suburbs of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the metropolitan boundaries of all settlements
around the capital, from Cuautla in the south to Queretaro, 142
miles north of the capital, are expected to merge, creating one
giant megalopolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toward the middle of the 21st century, this megalopolis will
concentrate approximately 50 million people,'' Gustavo Garza, a
demographer at the Colegio de Mexico, wrote in a recent essay. That
will require Mexican commuters to be even more long-suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the wasted time and the long distances drive me to
desperation,'' said Betancourt, who moved his family to Cuernavaca
because his wife came down with a respiratory disease in Mexico
City, which has serious pollution problems. ``But you've just got
to be patient.''

 &HT;    Southern blames jellyfish in Philippines blackout
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Forget about Y2K. Southern Co. is blaming a jellyfish
attack for gumming up the works at its new $1.4 billion Philippine
power plant and triggering a major blackout.
</P>
<P>
   Half the nation was plunged into darkness for several hours Dec.
10 when Southern's Sual Power Station shut down while thousands of
jellyfish were extracted from its cooling system.
</P>
<P>
   Many local politicians, however, are ridiculing what one called
a ``fishy'' explanation for the blackout and demanding an
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just doesn't gel,'' Sen. Juan Flavier was quoted as saying
in response to Southern's explanation. Sen. Francisco Tatad called
it an ``explanation that nobody understands,'' the Philippine Star
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Southern insists there is no squishiness to its fish story.
Philippine President Joseph Estrada, his energy secretary and the
state-run National Power Corp. have backed the jellyfish scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Southern opened the 1,200-megawatt plant 130 miles north of
Manila only two months ago and uses water from the South China Sea
to cool the coal-fired generators.
</P>
<P>
   David Mould, a spokesman for Southern Energy Inc., the
subsidiary that operates the plant, said an ``enormous
concentration'' of jellyfish crippled the plant when they were
sucked into a water treatment unit. A lack of cooling automatically
shut down the plant, which in turn triggered a ``cascading effect''
that knocked other power plants off line as well.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting blackout affected up to 40 million of the
archipelago nation's population of 73 million, according to
National Power, which purchases electricity from the Sual plant.
Most of the island of Luzon, including parts of metropolitan
Manila, were affected.
</P>
<P>
   Mould said power was completely restored within seven hours as
the other plants resumed operations. It took 14 hours to clean out
the jellyfish from one of the two generating units at Sual and
restore operations. The second unit was brought back Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty dump trucks full of the umbrella-shaped creatures were
removed from the cooling systems of the two coal-fired Sual units
following the incident, Mould said. ``We had to pull them out by
hand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As if the jellyfish were not enough, an earthquake measuring 6.8
on the Richter scale struck the same area Sunday. Mould said that
one marine biologist had speculated that the cnidarians may have
been fleeing the earthquake when they converged on Sual 24 hours
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Rodolfo Biazon, head of the Philippine Senate Defense
Committee, was quoted by the South China Morning Post as saying the
jellyfish affair had national security implications. Southern
should have anticipated the problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the incident, Southern has installed barriers at the plant
to prevent another jellyfish invasion and anticipates no further
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Southern opened the Sual plant with much fanfare in October
after more than two years of construction. The company inherited
the project when it acquired a Hong Kong-based independent power
company in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The plant is described as state-of-the-art and is the newest and
largest in the Philippines, which for years has been plagued by
power blackouts and brownouts.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have said it will add $100 million to Southern's
profits during the first full year of operations in 2000.

   ``Our players are really excited to be here. We start making
plans to be in Atlanta in the spring time,'' Southern linebacker
Channing Warner said.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the sixth appearance in the 9-year-old bowl for
Southern (11-1), which comes to town a week after defeating Jackson
State in Birmingham to capture its third consecutive SWAC title.
Just as was the case a year ago, when they defeated Bethune-Cookman
28-2, the Jaguars will be facing an opponent that finished third
its conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the SWAC, they must win their championship to
make it to Atlanta. We had to throw a few games to get here,'' said
Hampton coach Joe Taylor, whose team finished third in the MEAC
behind Division 1-AA playoff participants North Carolina A&AMP;T and
Florida A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton (7-4), from a league that has I-AA playoff options, will
be competing in the Heritage Bowl for the first time. In the
previous two postseasons, the Pirates represented the MEAC in the
playoff as that conference's champion.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars have a chance to win a 12th game for the first time
in the school's history. But Southern will have to win the rematch.
Southern knocked off Jackson State in the regular season, before
last weekend's victory over JSU in the SWAC championship battle. In
early October, the Jaguars posted a 21-6 victory over Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing (a rematch) does is give the team that lost the
incentive to prove to people they can beat the other team,''
Southern coach Pete Richardson said.

 &HT;    Rams are eady for Tuskegee
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There was a time when Kermit Blount didn't want his
team to face one coached by Rick Comegy.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, Blount welcomes that challenge in the Pioneer Bowl at
the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Blount will coach Winston-Salem State against Tuskegee's Golden
Tigers in the third annual event. The Rams are the CIAA champions
with a 7-0 conference record, a far cry from seven years ago, when
Blount inherited a struggling program and Comegy, then coaching at
NAIA power Central State of Ohio, called in search of a game.
Blount turned him down.
</P>
<P>
   Winston-Salem State features an offense led by 1,000-yard rusher
Terrie Newkirk, but most of the team's success has been credited to
a defense that was allowing 7.7 points per game before a
season-ending 25-23 loss to Grambling.
</P>
<P>
   Blount's team will try to cut down the production of tailback
Michael Scott, the SIAC's leading rusher, and quarterback Aaron
James of Jesup, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen (Scott) on film and he's a pretty good back. But
what we plan to do is what we've done all season: Shut them down,''
Winston-Salem cornerback Deryl Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Scott appears to be the central figure for Tuskegee,
Comegy thinks James may be the key for the Golden Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaron is going to have to keep his composure, make the right
reads and come up with some big plays if we're going be
successful,'' Comegy said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuskegee defeated Livingstone 23-9 in last year's Pioneer Bowl.

 &HT;    Quincy Carter is staying a Bulldog
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Stating that ``money isn't everything'' and that
he had goals left to accomplish at Georgia, quarterback Quincy
Carter will pass on the opportunity to become an NFL first-round
draft pick in order to return for his junior season with the
Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who said he had been ``50-50'' about turning pro, made
the announcement Friday at a news conference on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It basically boiled down to me being a competitor and wanting
to accomplish everything I wanted to accomplish in life,'' said
Carter, who was accompanied by his mother, Sherry Carter-Embree.
``Money is not the only thing in life and I realize that. I also
had to think about my college education, coming back to school and
getting a degree.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter completed 57 percent of his passes for 2,713 yards, 17
touchdowns and six interceptions this season. The Bulldogs finished
7-4 and will play Purdue (7-4) in the Outback Bowl on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   But Georgia failed to beat Tennessee, Florida and Georgia Tech
for the second year in a row and Carter has yet to achieve his
stated goal of leading the Bulldogs to the SEC championship and
contending for a national title.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream is to play in the NFL but, at the same time, you have
to think about the things you want to accomplish,'' Carter said.
``Winning an SEC championship and winning a national championship
are goals of mine and of this football team. I didn't feel like I
accomplished enough to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter consulted with coach Jim Donnan and with his family on
his NFL prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would have been a first-round pick,'' said Donnan, who said
he polled NFL general managers and coaches. ``Where he would go
would pretty much be based on each team's needs. But middle to late
first round is what we got from most people we talked to.''

 &HT;    Titans don't plan any changes at QB
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE - The Titans, after three consecutive 8-8 seasons, are
10-3 and clinch their first playoff berth in six years by beating
the Falcons on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But that success hasn't tempered the quarterback controversy
that is brewing in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Steve McNair, the team's first-round draft pick in 1995, hasn't
thrown a touchdown pass in six games. He threw seven interceptions
during that same stretch.
</P>
<P>
   McNair, who missed five games after undergoing surgery on Sept.
19 to repair a ruptured disc in his back, has a passer rating of
66.1. His rating is second-worst among AFC quarterbacks with at
least 187 pass attempts, leading only Pittsburgh's Kordell Stewart,
who was benched.
</P>
<P>
   Many Titans fans are calling for coach Jeff Fisher to replace
McNair with veteran Neil O'Donnell, who had a 4-1 record during
McNair's six-week absence. O'Donnell threw for 1,209 yards and
eight touchdowns in five starts.
</P>
<P>
   But Fisher insists there isn't a controversy, at least not among
his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the big topic around here and around the league now:
Why don't you make a change?,'' Fisher said. ``Well, Steve is 6-2
as a starter. He's 5-2 since coming back from a very significant,
serious injury. He's doing the things that we need to do to win
games.''
</P>
<P>
   And Fisher doesn't seem ready to make a change anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of other quarterbacks that have ratings much
higher than Steve that are playing on teams that don't have half as
many wins as we do,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is we're finding ways to win games. He's made
plays the last four weeks that very few quarterbacks could make and
those go unnoticed. It's the lack of touchdown passes that has
become issue. Steve has been our guy since we traded (Falcons
quarterback) Chris Chandler away and there's no question about
that. We have no intention of making a change.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair, 6 feet 2, 225 pounds, has been bothered by a bad case of
turf toe on his left foot. He also has a badly sprained ankle on
the same foot. McNair wore a stabilizing boot until Wednesday, but
he says he'll play against the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the foot that I plant with at the end of my throw, so you
can't get that much pressure on it and it's kind of hard being
accurate,'' McNair said. ``It makes you throw a little off the mark
when you can't plant and push down.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair, who had to overcome doubts that he could make the jump
from tiny Alcorn State to the NFL, seems unphased by the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has their opinion, but you can't pay attention to
that,'' he said. ``This team is focused on just winning and we're
not trying to make a (quarterback) change right now. ... We're in a
position right now we haven't been in a long time. We're not happy
with the passing game. We know things have to shape up if we want
to win games in the playoffs.''

 &HT;    Coke receives fine in Italian antitrust case
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola received more bad news from Europe on Friday
when Italian antitrust regulators fined the company $16.1 million
for abusing its dominant market position to exclude Pepsi.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it will appeal the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the ruling ... is inconsistent with Italian
and European competition laws and with commercial practices widely
accepted in Italy, as well as in other parts of Europe and around
the world,'' Enrico Nardulli, chairman of the Coca-Cola Bevande
Italia bottling company, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's antitrust authority said Coca-Cola and its Italian
bottlers worked together to try to eliminate Pepsi from the market
by offering discounts and other financial incentives to retailers
and wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   The authority also said Coca-Cola's Italian subsidiary offered
discounts to big distributors in exchange for display space or for
reducing the display space of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola controls about 46 percent of the carbonated soft drink
market in Italy, compared with 6 percent for Pepsi, according to
Beverage Digest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision preserves fair competition and consumer choice
in Italy,'' said Pepsico spokesman Jeff Brown. ``We hope this
decision puts an end to Coke's effort to restrain competition and
bully retailers.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola denied it bullied anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the time of the alleged anticompetitive practices,
retail pricing was stable or declined, Virgin cola entered the
Italian market, and Pepsi's market share grew,'' said Robert
Baskin, a Coca-Cola spokesman in Atlanta. ``That's a competitive
marketplace and demonstrates that we follow the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's decision stems from an investigation started in 1998
after complaints were filed by Pepsico and the Esselunga
supermarket chain.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based beverage giant faces similar investigations in
other European nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the $16 million is a material financial
matter,'' said analyst Marc Cohen of Goldman Sachs. ``But I think
this obviously is an embarrassing incident for the company and
raises questions about what might develop from other European
investigations.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also said he thinks the company's new president, Douglas
Daft, will give priority to dealing with such matters. The
Coca-Cola board has said Daft will be named chairman and chief
executive officer in April, when M. Douglas Ivester retires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Avoiding incidents like this is part of bringing back a more
positive and diplomatic image to the company,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   The $16.1 million fine amounts to 3 percent of Coca-Cola's
revenue in Italy. The company could have been fined as much as $80
million, or 10 percent of its Italian revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the company has stumbled in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's planned acquisition of the Orangina brand in France
was rejected by antitrust regulators there. And its purchase of
Cadbury Schweppes brands outside the United States was consummated
only after Coca-Cola eliminated 22 European nations from the deal
because of antitrust concerns by the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's shares rose $1.25 on Wall Steet, losing at $59.75.

 &HT;    Dell expands to Tennessee
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Dell Computer Corp. on Friday said it will
broaden its operations in Nashville, Tenn., with a sales office and
notebook PC plant, while a company executive voiced frustration
about the pace of road construction in Central Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion will raise Dell's work force in Tennessee to 3,000
by the middle of next summer, up from about 2,200 now, according to
the company.
</P>
<P>
   The Nashville operations represent Dell's first U.S. expansion
outside of Central Texas. When executives announced in April that
Dell would move manufacturing of its Dimension line of desktop
computers _ which is aimed at consumers and small businesses _ to
Tennessee, they cited strategic reasons as well as their concerns
that Dell is getting too big for Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Strategically, Nashville is closer to major hubs of carriers
such as United Parcel Service, which is in Louisville, Ky. That
shortens the time it takes to ship PCs to some areas of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   By adding the manufacturing plant for its Inspiron line of
notebook computers and a sales operation in Nashville, Dell is
creating an East Coast center for its home and small business
division.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has said it may be getting too big for Central
Texas. A consultant's study for Dell earlier this year estimated
that the computer maker accounted for half the direct and indirect
job growth in the region last year. Indirect jobs are those created
by demand for goods and services by employees and vendors.

 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Saturday afternoon's performance of ``Tristan und
Isolde'' at the Metropolitan Opera, the last of the season, with
the acclaimed new duo of Wagner opera, Ben Heppner and Jane Eaglen,
in the title roles, will also commemorate an illustrious night in
the history of the company, indeed, a milestone in the annals of
20th-century opera: exactly 40 years ago Saturday, Birgit Nilsson
made her Met debut in the role of Isolde.
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Nilsson, who is 81, will be in attendance, sitting in a
first-tier box as the guest of the Met's general manager, Joseph
Volpe. No official announcement of her presence will be made from
the stage before the performance. But count on opera fans to spot
her when she takes her seat and greet her with an ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Her debut, of course, occurred at the old opera house. Few Met
debuts have matched it in excitement and importance. The next day,
Howard Taubman's review in The New York Times made the front page,
accompanied by a close-up photo of the Swedish soprano smiling
during the tumultuous reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Birgit Nilsson filled the Metropolitan Opera House last night
with the glory of the finest Isolde since the unforgettable days of
Kirsten Flagstad two decades ago,'' Taubman wrote. ``With a voice
of extraordinary size, suppleness and brilliance, she dominated the
stage and the performance.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Nilsson was reminded recently during an interview in
her hotel room near Lincoln Center that this rave review was
accorded a place on The Times' front page, she replied, ``Ja, and
on the front page of The Herald Tribune too!''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nilsson has had some health problems lately and walks with
some difficulty but for the most part seems remarkably fit and
hardy. She has been spending most of her downtime during retirement
on the farm in rural Sweden where she was born and reared, although
as a young woman she hated farm work and couldn't wait to leave the
place. Her crusty father was disappointed that his only child was a
girl and could not comprehend why she wanted to pursue a quixotic
career as a singer rather than assume her place as a farmer's wife.
</P>
<P>
   But spending time in the country must be salutary now, for Ms.
Nilsson has plenty of energy. Over the last five days she has been
conducting master classes with singers from the Met's Lindemann
Young Artist Development Program. The sessions have been closed to
the public, but an invitation-only audience was permitted to
observe Ms. Nilsson at work.
</P>
<P>
   Her last appearance at the Met was as the Dyer's Wife in a
now-legendary performance of Strauss' ``Frau Ohne Schatten'' in the
fall of 1981, though she did sing once more from the stage during
the gargantuan gala concert in honor of James Levine's 25th
anniversary at the Met in 1996. After paying tribute to Levine, Ms.
Nilsson offered what she called a traditional ``Viking salute,''
which turned out to be Brunnhilde's famous salutation of
``Hojotoho! Hojotoho!,'' topped off with a couple of high Bs and
high Cs that dramatic sopranos half her age would have coveted.
</P>
<P>
   Though Heppner and Ms. Eaglen are being paired in the minds of
Wagner fans as the Tristan and Isolde of the future, Ms. Nilsson
never really had a comparable partner. The closest was the German
tenor Wolfgang Windgassen, who died in 1974. Of the 209
performances of the opera she sang in her career, Windgassen was
her Tristan in more than 100 of them, Ms. Nilsson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a fine colleague and artist,'' she said. ``He had
style. He didn't overact. His voice was lyric; it was a small
voice. But the sound was beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   The tenor Jon Vickers, with his heroic sound, came closest to
matching her, though he was an elusive Tristan. During the 1960s
Vickers repeatedly promised to take on the role for her, but kept
withdrawing. Finally he made good. His debut as Tristan came in
Buenos Aires in 1971, with Ms. Nilsson as his grateful Isolde.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him at the time that I waited and waited for my Tristan
for 14 years,'' Ms. Nilsson said, ``as long as Jacob waited for
Rachel in the Bible.'' They sang it together only once at the Met,
another legendary performance, on Jan. 30, 1974. ``Maybe he was
uncomfortable with me,'' Ms. Nilsson said, somewhat wistfully. ``I
don't know.'' She also cited the American tenor Jess Thomas. ``He
was an excellent Tristan, good-looking, wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course she also heard and sang with Tristans who were not so
good, purportedly great Wagnerian tenors who ``belted out the
role,'' she said. ``They shouted, they wobbled. The voice was so
spread out you couldn't decide within four notes which one they
were trying to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   For all her acclaim in the German dramatic repertory, Ms.
Nilsson never let herself get trapped by it. She assiduously kept
performing Italian roles as well. ``This was the only way to
survive,'' she said. ``When I sang too much Wagner, the voice got
dark, without shine, and heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nilsson once told Levine that it was essential for her to
keep Mozart in her repertory, even though she knew that she was
probably few people's ideal of a Mozart singer. ``I have not been
good to Mozart,'' she said at the time, ``but Mozart has been very
good to me.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In her master classes Ms. Nilsson repeatedly emphasized the
importance of supporting the voice from the abdomen and letting the
sound emerge without tension through the throat and what she calls
``the mask,'' meaning the head and face. This basic technique is
not well understood by the public. Human beings are born with
proper vocal technique, as anyone knows who has heard the crying of
an infant fill an entire house. But people lose that natural
ability to project sound and soon begin to speak and sing through
our throats. Voice teachers have to break those habits and get
young adults singing naturally, with proper abdominal support.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Nilsson's master class on Wednesday afternoon at the
Met's intimate List Hall, the first singer was a 25-year-old tenor,
Charles Castronovo, who recently made his Met debut as Beppe in
``Cavalleria Rusticana.'' When he announced his name to the
audience, Ms. Nilsson jumped in, already critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one understood you,'' she said. ``Say your name clearly.
Maybe somebody is sitting here with a contract.'' She proved to be
as quick with one-liners as David Letterman. When Castronovo was
about to sing ``Dies Bildnis ist bezaubernd schoen'' from Mozart's
``Zauberfloete,'' a renowned lyric tenor aria, Ms. Nilsson said
with mock distress: ``No score for me? I never sang that aria
before.'' Then, with savvy timing, she added, almost under her
breath, ``I was sick that day.''
</P>
<P>
   After Castronovo's performance, Ms. Nilsson told the audience
that the young man, with whom she had worked earlier in the week,
was a very talented tenor with an appealing voice and solid
musicianship, but that, as with many younger singers in her
experience, his sound was produced too much from the throat,
without sufficient abdominal support.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mask,'' she said, putting her hands on her face, ``is like
our resonance room, our violin case, our piano case. Let the sound
come through it, but support the sound.'' As Castronovo sang a
particular phrase, Ms. Nilsson said that he was concentrating too
much sound on an upbeat note that leaps to a higher note. ``Your
upbeat is killing the high note,'' she said, suggesting that the
lower note should provide a lift to the higher one, ``like a diving
board.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point she approached the strapping young man and, in a
gesture of comfort, placed her hand around his upper arm. ``Oh, you
have big muscles,'' she said, turning to the audience and winking
as the tenor blushed. ``I thought he was so skinny.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, when Marjorie Elinor Dix, a soprano, sang the aria
``Elsa's Dream'' from Wagner's ``Lohengrin,'' Ms. Nilsson needed no
score. She was able to correct pitches exactly and shape phrases
from memory. As before, she emphasized the importance of supporting
the voice and praised Ms. Dix for the increased radiance of her
sound in the upper register when she sang with freedom, from ``deep
down,'' as Ms. Nilsson put it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nilsson had nothing but praise for the performance of ``Il
mio tesoro,'' Don Ottavio's aria from Mozart's ``Don Giovanni,'' as
sung by the tenor Eric Cutler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I would have heard it as good when I sang Donna Anna,''
she said. ``It's very vigorous, which is right. You don't want to
sound like a Mrs. Donna Anna.'' She cautioned the tenor about his
slight tendency to sing sharp but added that, on balance, it was
better to be a little sharp than flat. She too had a tendency to go
slightly sharp, she said, though in fact her unerring sense of
pitch was routinely cited by critics during her career. ``Maybe
singing sharp a bit is Swedish,'' she said. ``Jussi Bjorling, you
know, was also sometimes sharp a little.''
</P>
<P>
   After the class Ms. Nilsson remained to greet well-wishers. Some
people had brought her recordings for her to autograph, though Ms.
Nilsson asserted that she seldom listened to them herself. During
the 1960s and early '70s, when she made most of her recordings, the
technology was not advanced enough to capture her enormous voice
well, she said. Many critics agree that recordings of the Nilsson
voice do not suggest how glorious it was when heard live. Still,
her discography is extensive and monumentally important.

COUNCIL MEETS ON BRITISH-IRISH PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The final piece of the institutional jigsaw puzzle at
the heart of the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 fell into place
Friday with the first-ever meeting of the council that will oversee
areas of mutual interest on the islands of Britain and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Opening what they said was a new era in better relations between
their two nations, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish
counterpart, Bertie Ahern, convened the British-Irish Council,
which includes representatives from the newly-empowered local
assemblies of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, as well as
officials from the British islands of Jersey, Guernsey, and the
Isle of Man.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many years, relations between the Irish and British
governments, which were of necessity dominated by the issue of
Northern Ireland, were conducted in a bipolar framework, between
Dublin and London,'' said Ahern. ``We were in the habit,
inaccurately but revealingly, of thinking in terms of Anglo-Irish
relations. This terminology is no longer adequate for the complex
reality which I see represented here at this table.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair agreed, saying, ``We are setting the seal on a truly
unique relationship for the future, between the Republic of
Ireland, Northern Ireland, and the rest of these islands.''
</P>
<P>
   After presiding over the formal opening of the council at
Lancaster House, Blair and Ahern had to make only a brief journey
around St. James Park to 10 Downing Street for the first meeting of
the two governments under the terms set forth in a Anglo-Irish
treaty signed two weeks ago in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   The British-Irish Council, which will hold summits twice a year,
was the idea of David Trimble, the Ulster Unionist leader and first
minister of the Northern Ireland Assembly. It is meant to provide a
balance to the North-South Ministerial Council that will oversee
six areas of cross-border mutual interest, such as agriculture, in
the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Irish nationalists in Northern Ireland consider the
cross-border institutions essential to acknowledging their
Irishness, unionists in Northern Ireland see the British-Irish
Council as underpinning their sense of being British.
</P>
<P>
   The council overseeing the cross-border institutions met for the
first time Monday in Armagh, the city in Northern Ireland that is
the seat for both the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches in
Ireland. Ahern led members of his Cabinet to that meeting, then
flew Friday for London to complete the formalization of the three
strands of relationships between the north and south of Ireland,
the islands of Britain and Ireland, and the governments in Dublin
and London.
</P>
<P>
   With Friday's meeting, the key constitutional elements of the
Good Friday Agreement of 1998 have been implemented _ the
power-sharing government in Northern Ireland, the cross-border
institutions giving Dublin a direct role in affairs in Northern
Ireland, and now the council that formalizes links between the two
neighboring islands. The Good Friday agreement, fashioned under the
mediation of former US senator George Mitchell, a Democrat from
Maine, produced a political settlement designed to end years of
sectarian violence in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   So much has happened in the last few weeks that another
milestone passed Friday with little fanfare. When Blair shook hands
with Bairbre de Brun, the Sinn Fein official in charge of health in
Northern Ireland, it marked the first time a British prime minister
had shaken hands in public with someone from Sinn Fein, the
political allies of the Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the optimism on both sides of the Irish Sea, the
political progress could still be shattered in two months. Trimble
got his party to drop its refusal to form a power-sharing
government with members of Sinn Fein before the IRA began
disarming, but he says he and his party will withdraw and collapse
the Northern Ireland assembly if the IRA does not begin to disarm
by February.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, however, those who gathered here, except for Trimble,
were content to remark on the historic importance of the day and
the last two weeks. Trimble, speaking to reporters with Seamus
Mallon, the Catholic nationalist who is the first deputy minister
of the Northern Ireland Assembly, said he was hesitant to proclaim
Friday as historic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not quite there yet,'' Trimble said, but he added that
the moment may not be far off.
</P>
<P>
   Mallon quickly interjected, ``You'll know that moment because
he's promised he'll buy a drink.''
</P>
<P>
   That Trimble, Mallon, and the assembled dignitaries all laughed
underscored how much progress has been made in the last month.

 &HT;    Gingriches reach settlement, avoid
 &HT;    high-profile trial
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Attorneys for former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich
and his soon-to-be ex-wife expect a judge to approve the couple's
divorce within a month.
</P>
<P>
   A court-appointed mediator who spent 12 hours negotiating a
settlement agreement between the Gingriches filed her report
Friday, saying the couple came to a ``full settlement'' early that
morning.
</P>
<P>
   With the agreement, Newt and Marianne Gingrich end a tense legal
standoff and avoid a potentially embarrassing public divorce trial.
The couple have agreed to keep the terms of the agreement
confidential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very intense negotiation,'' said Gingrich's business attorney,
Randy Evans. ``I think both parties worked very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement closes five months of bitter legal wrangling in
the case, culminating with Gingrich's admission last month that
he's had a romantic relationship with a Washington congressional
aide for six years.
</P>
<P>
   The harsh attention to his private life had begun to affect
Gingrich's standing as one of the national Republican's primary
ideologists and fund-raisers. Several GOP members of Congress had
raised objections to Gingrich's attendance at ceremonies in
Washington this fall marking the fifth anniversary of the
Republican takeover of the U.S. House.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, 56, resigned as speaker just over a year ago, after
severe losses in the November 1998 elections. He maintains that his
affair with 33-year-old Callista Bisek, a scheduler and secretary
for the House Agriculture Committee, was not a factor in his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Though lawyers in the case wouldn't say so, divorce lawyers
across the country speculated that Gingrich's future earnings were
probably a major issue in the discussions. While his finances were
limited as a leader of Congress, as a private citizen Gingrich had
begun to snag speaking fees and corporate positions. Gingrich is
now a political commentator for Fox News.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Thursday's mediation, Gingrich said he was willing to
pay his wife alimony.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's agreement lays out how the Gingriches will split their
property, money and other assets. It came during a grueling
court-ordered mediation session which began at 1:30 p.m. Thursday
and ended exactly 12 hours later.
</P>
<P>
   The Gingriches, who hadn't seen each other in person since June,
spent much of the session in separate rooms at the Cobb County law
offices of John Mayoue, Marianne Gingrich's attorney. The couple
communicated through their $100-an-hour mediator, who was selected
by the court.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers wouldn't say whether the couple met face-to-face,
but the Gingriches could be seen briefly mingling in the hall once
or twice. At one point, the couple's lawyers left the Gingriches
alone and took a walk.
</P>
<P>
   After signing the deal, the Gingriches and their attorneys
boarded an elevator together for the trip 22 floors down to the
parking lot. Gingrich shooed away several television cameramen that
tried to get on with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's over,'' he said, declining to comment about the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich, her eyes bloodshot, said she was exhausted.
When asked if she was happy with the settlement, the 48-year-old
Ohio native would say only, ``It's been a long day.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayoue answered the same question with raised eyebrows and an
affirmative nod, although his words were more diplomatic: ``It's
fair to everybody. We're pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, Mayoue summed up his feelings this way: ``It's not
exhilaration. It's more a sense that this fight, that Marianne
never wanted, is being put to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Newt Gingrich who filed for divorce July 29, although
Marianne Gingrich subsequently asked for a jury trial.
</P>
<P>
   A Washington, D.C., judge had also granted her the right to
question Bisek under oath; that will not take place now.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Clay, chairman of the Georgia Republican Party, said the
divorce settlement will likely make it easier for Gingrich to
return to the public eye in a political setting.
</P>
<P>
   Clay said there are no plans for Gingrich to get involved with
the state GOP, but that the party won't shut him out if he wants to
lend his influence. ``Are there places that I could see utilizing
Newt Gingrich in some capacity? Yes,'' Clay said.
</P>
<P>
   On a personal level, Clay was pleased to hear Gingrich's divorce
was over. ``It's always both a relief and it's certainly the
beginning of a healing process, to settle a case rather than drag
it out in a public forum.''

WHEN IT COMES TO WINE ONLINE, IT'S YAK-YAK-YAK 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes it seems that people like talking about wine even more
than drinking it.
</P>
<P>
   We yak around the dinner table past midnight. Every clerk in a
wine shop gets an ear-chewing. If we corner a winemaker _ the poor
devil _ we're in heaven. We form cliques and clubs and gather at
large tastings, chatty herds, wine glasses in hand.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Ah yes, the Internet, the epic clatter of keyboards heard 'round
the world. It makes your wrists swell just thinking about it. And a
good number of those people are chatting about wine, whether it's
in private e-mails, in chat rooms or on bulletin boards.
</P>
<P>
   Wine, of course, has been a topic on the Net since the stone age
of alt.food.wine, but now the worldwide wine community is hanging
out on the Net as never before.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the facelessness. Wine talk can so easily be
pretentious and intimidating. Online you can write what you would
never say. Let's face it, the wine world can be stuffy, and the
Internet pops that balloon right away.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps it's a matter of geography. Wine lovers are spread
thin around the globe _ there aren't many towns that can fill an
arena with enophiles _ so the Internet is a natural town hall.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most popular boards, particularly with wine lovers in
the United States, are the Wine Lovers' Discussion Group
(www.wine-lovers-page.com/forum/general) and West Coast Wine
Network (www.westcoastwine.net/wwwboard1.html). The wine board at
America Online isn't nearly as active as it used to be, but it
offers a few insights.
</P>
<P>
   For the big picture, you need to turn to Robin Garr, whose Wine
Lovers' Page was one of the first independent wine Web sites.
Before he launched the site as the ``Wine Bargain Page'' in 1993,
he put in time running the wine board at CompuServe.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are passionate about a subject enjoy finding other
people who feel the same way, and I don't think that applies only
to wine,'' Garr said.
</P>
<P>
   Wine lovers are certainly a passionate bunch, and the Internet
allows them a forum they might not get otherwise. The same guy who
complains about the line at the ATM will post a 10-page thesis on
the 1995 Barolos. With footnotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Few of us are content with merely enjoying the occasional
glass of wine Most of us delve more deeply into the subject,'' Mark
Levesque, who's a regular on Garr's board, wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua du Lac, who participates on the West Coast board from his
home in Sacramento, Calif., would agree. ``I find it harder to
enjoy wine without evaluating it. Which isn't to say I don't enjoy
it. It's just that it's hard for me to put anything across my
palate _ even if it's a $7 bottle served at a wedding _ without
considering what I like and dislike about it. I guess that means
I've shifted from being a drinker to a taster.''
</P>
<P>
   It's this kind of passion that many wine fans crave and often
can't find without the Net. Matthew Cooper, a regular on the West
Coast board, said: ``I live in Lexington, Ky., an area not known
for its love of wine, so it is difficult to find others with the
same passion. The board is like having a wine club/tasting group
with 10,000 members.''
</P>
<P>
   For many, the wine boards are a substitute for the traditional
wine press. You can find like-minded drinkers, and when it comes to
new wines, the boards are often weeks ahead of the magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information is more current than any other source,''
Gordon Drake said of the West Coast board. ``By the time I got my
Wine Spectator, the Constant mailing list was closed. Not so for
Flowers, Pride, Jones Family, La Sirena and Showket, all of which
were posted on this site.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What you get,'' Levesque added, ``is unvarnished opinion, not
glossy marketing-speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are challenges. Without a face behind the words,
intentions can easily be misread. ``Humor is very difficult, and
tone is very hard to gauge,'' Cole Kendall of Washington, D.C.,
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main challenge is keeping things civil,'' Craig of
Montreal wrote. ``There's always a danger of being misunderstood or
of someone taking offense when none was intended.''
</P>
<P>
   For many participants, the board goes beyond wine chitchat. What
keeps them dialing in is a sense of community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us have also made friends for life,'' Paul, a regular
on the AOL board, wrote. Three years ago, for example, Paul was
having an online argument about the 1981 La Mission Haut Brion. ``I
told him he was nuts and if he was ever on Long Island (N.Y.) that
I would open one up for him. We quickly discovered that we both
live in Syosset and have been great friends ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   One regular on the West Coast board added, ``When my father died
I received messages from dozens of people I'd never met, messages
that helped me deal with the loss in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the hankering for wine goes beyond the Net and most
of the boards have what they call ``off-lines:'' tastings and
dinners at cities around the country. Often the wines served are
treasures from the wine cellar.
</P>
<P>
   ``People,'' Kendall said, ``are incredibly generous with their
wine and friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stuart Yaniger of Napa, Calif., put it best. And it sort of
fits the whole tone of what I'm writing about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember my first off-line,'' Yaniger wrote. ``It was at
Ridge Vineyards. We were supposed to meet in the picnic area. My
wife asked me what the participants looked like. I responded,
`12-point Letter Gothic.'''

 &HT;    History a postive and a nagative for Bradley
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During a television interview this fall, Democrat
Bill Bradley was confronted with the weight of history: no sitting
vice president, his interviewer asserted, had ever been defeated
for his party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Not true, Bradley responded. Vice President George Clinton lost
to James Madison to succeed President Jefferson _ in 1808. A far
better historical precedent, Bradley said, was the fact that George
Bush was the first vice president to win the presidency in 150
years.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, trying to wrest the nomination from Vice President
Gore, was both right and wrong. Bush was the first vice president
to be elected president since Martin Van Buren did it in 1836. But
history is dotted with other examples of vice presidents who
coveted the presidency but failed to win the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Alben Barkley, who served under President Truman
and had the affectionate nickname ``Veep,'' sought the Democratic
nomination in 1952 but watched it go to Adlai E. Stevenson. Charles
Fairbanks, vice president to President Theodore Roosevelt, saw the
nomination go to William H. Taft, who was subsequently elected
president, after Roosevelt worked against Fairbanks.
</P>
<P>
   Only 14 of the nation's 44 vice presidents, excluding Gore, have
become president, and eight of those reached the office when their
president died in office.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no election in America's history is comparable to the
present. The job of vice president, the party nominating process,
even the method of electing presidents has changed radically since
John Adams became the nation's first vice president under President
George Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1804, members of the electoral college were required to
vote for two men, one of whom could not be from their home state.
The top vote getter became president and the second place finisher
became the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The system was changed in time for the 1804 elections after the
electoral college vote of 1800 produced a tie between Jefferson and
Aaron Burr, forcing Congress to engage in a protracted round of
balloting that ultimately made Jefferson the winner and Burr the
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's fate in 1808 was typical of what could happen to a
vice president. Although Clinton, a revolutionary war hero and
former governor of New York, wanted to succeed Jefferson, Jefferson
held his aging vice president in low regard and wanted his friend
and secretary of state James Madison to become the fifth president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's consolation prize was to become vice president again
under Madison. He created a small constitutional crisis when he
declined to either acknowledge or refuse the vice presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really thought he was running for president at that point
and the caucus renominated him for vice president,'' says Don
Ritchie, the Senate Historian, co-author of ``Vice Presidents of
the United States 1789-1993.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidents didn't have any say in selecting their running mates,
who were generally chosen because of which state they represented,
or because of which ideological wing of the party they came from.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were usually thrust on the ticket to balance it,''
Ritchie said. ``You often got situations where the president and
the vice president were just passing acquaintances.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also wasn't considered a part of the
executive branch. He served as the president of the Senate and was
regarded as a part of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   President Woodrow Wilson was the first president to even invite
his vice president to attend cabinet meetings, and even then the
vice president wasn't an active participant.
</P>
<P>
   Until President Franklin Roosevelt, presidential candidates or
their running mates didn't attend the nominating conventions, let
alone engage in much campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a mind set in the 19th century and early 20th
century that the man shouldn't seek the office,'' Ritchie said.
``The office should seek the man. So a lot of people who really
were candidates never officially declared themselves as candidates.
They just waited for the party to come to them and ask them to
serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the party often never came calling, so the vice
president was left to simply suffer the fate of someone like
Barkley, who was passed over when Truman decided not to seek
re-election in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   Since Barkley, vice presidents have been more successful in
winning their party's nomination, but fared poorly in winning the
White House on their first try.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nixon became the Republican nominee in 1960 after
serving as Eisenhower's vice president, but didn't become president
until the election of 1968. Hubert Humphrey, President Johnson's
vice president, won the Democratic nomination in 1968 but went no
farther.
</P>
<P>
   Bush broke the record in 1988, succeeding President Reagan. But
Bush suffered in 1992 when he became viewed as not simply a
four-year president, but part of a 12-year administration.
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle, who dropped his presidential
bid earlier in the fall, joins the list of vice presidents who
haven't been able to convert the number two job into a trip to the
Oval office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your stuck with whatever the record is of your president,''
said Ritchie. ``And usually there is a fair amount of
dissatisfaction with the president, especially after eight years.
The parties do tend to alternate. People get tired and they want to
try something new. And they forget what they disliked about the
party the last time they were in office.''

WHEN THIS PARTY ENDS, MORE WILL FEEL THE PAIN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 19) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With all the excitement of the approaching millennium, it is
understandable that a different anniversary has been largely
ignored. December was the month, in 1996, when Alan Greenspan made
his famous warning about ``irrational exuberance.''
</P>
<P>
   He was uncertain then whether stock prices had become ``unduly
escalated.'' But three years later and 4,800 points higher on the
Dow Jones industrial average, doubt is gone. The market is clearly
exuberant and irrational.
</P>
<P>
   That might not be so terrible if this were 1987 or the
mid-1970s, when bubbles burst and stock prices took famous plunges.
Fewer shareholders counted so much on their paper wealth in those
days, and fewer executives relied so heavily on a rising market to
sustain their entrepreneurial spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the selloff that now seems inevitable will do only passing
damage. But the odds of getting off easily this time are fading.
The national economy and the market have become too intertwined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every optimistic forecast about the economy is based on the
premise that stock prices will either go up or change very
little,'' said Henry Kaufman, the Wall Street economist. ``Not
since World War II have we been so dependent on the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists count the ways. Some items on the list are already
well known, the most familiar being the ``wealth effect'': rising
stock prices encourage consumers to spend more and borrow more,
activities that almost certainly will come to a halt, shrinking the
economy, if the Dow Jones average falls by 30 percent or so and
stays down for at least six months.
</P>
<P>
   Even people who don't own stock hear all the glad tidings on the
evening news. They see in the rising market a signal that the
economy is OK and that their jobs are safe, noted Edward McKelvey,
senior economist at Goldman, Sachs. So they, too, spend beyond
their incomes.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Market selloff would throw the effect into reverse. The spenders
would pull way back. Companies would, too, in response. Job growth
would halt; the unemployment rate would rise and incomes would
fall. But debt would not, and everyone _ companies and households _
would pull back more in the scramble to pay debts and restore
savings that evaporated in the market decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``A selloff would bring us the first stock-market-induced
recession since before the Second World War,'' said Stephen S.
Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he does not surrender optimism. Although he anticipates a
selloff, he does not forecast a recession. When the downfall comes,
Roach and many others will count on Greenspan's Federal Reserve to
lower interest rates quickly enough and to take other steps to
prevent the anticipated chain reaction of belt-tightening from
happening.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for damage, however, is spreading in small and
perhaps uncontrollable ways. Many corporations, for example, no
longer have to add cash to their employee pension funds. Because
the funds have invested in a rising stock market, they are fully
funded.
</P>
<P>
   As long as stocks keep their value, the corporate money that
would have been needed for pension contributions augments profits
instead, or is invested in new products and equipment, activities
that keep the economy humming. If the stock market falls sharply,
that money would again have to be channeled into the pension funds
to keep them whole.
</P>
<P>
   Grants from foundations would also decline after a selloff, and
they finance thousands of projects and considerable research and
employment. Grants are geared to a foundation's wealth, and
foundations invest heavily in stocks. Grant money has risen in step
with the market. A selloff would produce a reversal of this trend.
</P>
<P>
   On a different level, corporate mergers, particularly those in
which one company pays for another with stock, would become more
difficult. ``We have a sense in this booming stock market that
there is no deal we cannot do,'' said Peter L. Bernstein, an
economist and author.
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there is the spreading use of stock options
as pay in place of cash, a practice that is marching down the
hierarchy to lower ranks of workers. A market fall that lasted for
a while would render many of those options worthless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, a lot of people will be angry,'' said Dean Baker,
co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in
Washington, ``and some will try to get paid retroactively in
cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there are all the flourishing Internet companies. They
float new stock and watch it soar in value even as many companies
fail to make a profit. The market wealth covers the shortfall. Or
it makes possible borrowing and expansion in pursuit of success in
a new technology that is vibrant and promising.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it? Is it the technology that kindles the entrepreneurial
spirit in the Internet billionaires, or is it the stock market?
</P>
<P>
   Probably both. But we must wait for the market selloff to get a
more sober fix on the lasting changes wrought by the Internet, the
star technology in the much-proclaimed new economy.

NEW PLAN WOULD ALLOW UN INSPECTORS BACK IN IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAURIA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Security Council adopted a plan Friday that could
allow UN weapons inspectors to return to Iraq for the first time in
a year. The plan also would suspend economic sanctions on Baghdad
if it cooperates with the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution passed with four abstentions, by China, Russia,
France, and Malaysia, leading some diplomats to fear the council
sent smixed signals to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   France said the resolution was too ambiguous and could lead to a
new crisis with Baghdad. Russia also said the resolution made it
unclear what Iraq had to do. China said the lack of consensus made
the resolution unenforceable.
</P>
<P>
   But US diplomats played down the abstentions. ``This was adopted
with 11 votes and the four who abstained all said they would be
dedicated to get Iraq to cooperate with it,'' said Peter Burleigh,
deputy US representative to the United Nations. ``The ball is back
in Iraq's court. They have to deliver to get sanctions suspended.''
</P>
<P>
   Baghdad insisted it would reject the resolution because it does
not immediately lift all economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The council offered Iraq a complicated formula that would lift
restrictions on oil exports immediately and suspend import and
export sanctions after certain disarmament goals are achieved. It
dangles before Baghdad the prospect of lifting the cap on its oil
exports under the UN oil-for-food program, although the United
Nations still would control profits.
</P>
<P>
   Under the oil-for-food deal, Iraq has been permitted the past
three years to export only $5.2 billion in petroleum for renewable
six-month periods, with the proceeds going into a UN escrow
account.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations then buys food and humanitarian supplies for
Iraqis who have been hurt by nine years of UN sanctions imposed
after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi diplomats say they prefer the existing cap on oil exports
because it provides them some measure of relief without accepting
new weapons monitors. Iraq also would have to pay for the monitors
out of the escrow account.
</P>
<P>
   A European diplomat said that allowing Iraq to sell unlimited
oil would remove the criticism that the West was insensitive to
Iraqi suffering.
</P>
<P>
   The former inspection team, known as UNSCOM, fled Iraq last
December just before the United States and Britain launched
airstrikes designed to force President Saddam Hussein to cooperate
with inspections. Iraq has barred the return of the monitors ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   The monitors had been searching for Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, including chemical, biological, and long-range missile
programs. Iraq also has stopped cooperating with the International
Atomic Energy Agency, which is charged with uncovering Baghdad's
nuclear weapons project.
</P>
<P>
   This has led to fears in some Western capitals that Iraq may
again be pursuing the bomb. That is why Washington and London in
particular deem it urgent to return a UN team.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, Baghdad needs the inspectors because sanctions
cannot be permanently lifted until they declare Iraq free of
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The reconstituted inspection team, to be known as the UN
Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, or UNMOVIC,
would not get into Iraq for several months, if Iraq agreed to
accept them, UN officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The council has given UN Secretary General Kofi Annan 30 days to
appoint an executive chairman for UNMOVIC, who would then have 45
days to come up with an organizational plan. After he had hired new
staff, which could take months, UNMOVIC would attempt to enter
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   If Baghdad let inspectors return, the monitors would have 60
days to present to the council its plan of operation, including the
remaining disarmament it believed Iraq had to complete.
</P>
<P>
   If Iraq cooperates with the inspectors' plan for 120 days the
council would suspend import and export sanctions for renewable
120-day periods, allowing the United States or Britain to slap the
sanctions back on Baghdad if it misbehaved.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution retains the legal language necessary to allow
military action if necessary. However, British diplomats stressed
that Friday's resolution is not a pretext to use force against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Iraq does not meet the standards for the suspension of
sanctions, then the sanctions will continue,'' said Jeremy
Greenstock, Britain's UN envoy. ``The use of force is not a way to
deal with Iraq on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The council worked eight months on Friday's resolution, with
several holdups in the past two weeks, mostly because of Russian
objections.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been Baghdad's closest friend on the council. Moscow
is motivated in part by more than $7 billion in Soviet-era debt
owed to it by Iraq, mostly for arms sales.

CMGI ANNOUNCES ALTAVISTA IPO, FUND-RAISING PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Internet company CMGI Inc. chose the day of its annual
shareholders meeting to announce the long-awaited public offering
of stock in its AltaVista Internet search service.
</P>
<P>
   In papers filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
CMGI said it would try to raise as much as $300 million in the
initial public offering. CMGI bought AltaVista, one of the most
popular search services on the Internet, for $2.3 billion earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, CMGI filed a separate notice of intent to raise $1
billion through sales of stocks and bonds, with the money to be
spent on general corporate purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The announcements came hours after the close of the shareholders
meeting, where CMGI CEO David Wetherell revealed that his firm is
considering an IPO of its (at)Ventures venture capital fund, which
invests in Internet startups. Wetherell didn't reveal when such a
stock offering would be made, but said it would be ``sooner rather
than later.''
</P>
<P>
   A public sale of (at)Ventures stock would likely be one of the
most popular of the new year, considering the extraordinary
performance of CMGI's shares. CMGI stock traded at 28 5/8 at the
start of the year, and closed Friday at 211-13/16 on the Nasdaq
stock exchange. The Andover company announced Thursday it would
split its stock 2 for 1 on Jan. 11, its second split in a year.
Delighted shareholders at the meeting frequently applauded
Wetherell, with one investor begging him to take good care of his
health.
</P>
<P>
   But any Wetherell fitness program will not include slowing down.
He announced more deals at the meeting, including a nuts-and-bolts
alliance with Akamai Technologies of Cambridge, Mass. CMGI will
speed up the distribution of data from its Web-based companies by
pumping it through through Akamai's worldwide data network. Users
of CMGI's AltaVista search service and NaviSite Web site hosting
service could see improved performance as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Also, CMGI will leverage its recent deal with Pacific Century
CyberWorks, a Hong Kong satellite communications company, to
distribute Internet data in Asia. CMGI aims to improve the
performance of Asian Internet services by transmitting data from
space directly to local data caches run by Akamai.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders also got a preview of iCast, a free software
download for multimedia entertainment. The software plays audio and
video files over the Internet, as well as CD recordings on the
user's own computer.
</P>
<P>
   But in addition, iCast automatically identifies the CD being
played, and links the listener to CMGI-operated Web sites
containing information on the artist and links to other Internet
users with similar tastes in music. The iCast software also
features chat rooms where people can communicate while listening to
a favorite Internet radio station.
</P>
<P>
   However, CMGI CEO David Wetherell said that one of his company's
least glamorous investments _ Engage Technologies _ is at the heart
of its entire business strategy. Engage uses cookies _ small bits
of data attached to the browsers of Internet users _ to follow
people through the Internet, collecting detailed data on their
Web-surfing habits. This information is then used to precisely
target them with advertisements tailored to the user's tastes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think someday this will be the most valuable database in the
world,'' Wetherell said, predicting that leading Web advertisers
will demand the kind of targeted marketing that Engage can provide.
Wetherell described how the millions of visitors to other CMGI
Internet sites will constantly feed new data to the Engage
database. In turn, that new data will be used to display targeted
advertising to the Web site's visitors, with advertisers paying
handsomely for the privilege.

HARVARD MONEY MANAGERS BRING IN LESS BACON, LOWER PAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harvard University's elite money managers are punishing
themelves.
</P>
<P>
   Top executives at the institution's investment arm are taking
home lower pay this year, due to leaner returns in their mega
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   In the lucrative investing world, ``less'' can be relative. The
Harvard managers, who run the university's $14 billion endowment,
are still among the best paid in the business. Their paychecks
declined nowhere near as much as their investment returns, whose
leaner shape Harvard has blamed on outside, non-staff money
managers, an inability to place more cash in venture capital funds,
and tough benchmarks.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Management's new top earner, Philip Dubuque, will take
home $9.5 million in salary and bonus for the fiscal year ended in
June, just under the $10.2 million last year's lead earner,
Jonathon Jacobson, garnered. Jacobson left the firm last year to
start a private investment fund.
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, the firm's top five money managers, president, and
dozens of other employees will take home $41.3 million this year,
compared with $45.4 million last year. The slimmer bounty, most of
which goes to the top guns, is still about 50 percent above 1997's
payout and four times 1996 levels.
</P>
<P>
   The pay packages are closely watched by the secretive investment
industry and by some university critics, who dislike the fact that
Harvard money managers earn more than a tenured professor. Most of
the compensation comes from bonuses, which are tied to performance
over time.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most money management companies, Harvard Management is
required to disclose compensation in routine tax filings because it
is technically a nonprofit. Harvard, whose endowment is the largest
of its kind, defends the pay packages as suitable for professional
investors who have earned the university billions of dollars. It
says hiring more outside companies to oversee the endowment would
cost far more.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Harvard Management reported a total return of 12.2
percent for fiscal 1999. That figure, far below the firm's
benchmark of 18.9 percent, was a drop from year-ago levels of 20.5
percent. Harvard Management president Jack Meyer said in a
September letter to university contributors that the
underperformance was due to unnamed, outside money managers the
firm uses to manage part of its portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Still, over the long term, the portfolio has done well, gaining
20.1 percent over five years, just over its goal of 19.1 percent.
The median for that period for large institutional funds, which
include university endowments, was 16.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard places some of its money in the hands of two former
Harvard Management professionals, Jacobson and Tim Peterson, a
high-yield manager who left in September to form his own company,
Regiment Capital. A Harvard Management spokeswoman declined to name
other outside managers. The university farms out about one third of
its endowment portfolio to other firms.
</P>
<P>
   Within Harvard Management, David Mittelman, who manages
fixed-income, saw his pay package fall to $8.9 million from $9.8
million last year. Phillip Gross, equities, fell to $8.7 million
from $9.7 million. Robert Atchison, equities, slipped to $7.3
million from $7.9 million. And Jeffrey Larson, foreign equity, took
home $1.6 million. He didn't make the top five last year.
</P>
<P>
   President Jack Meyer earned $1.6 million, down from $1.8
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are well paid relative to the market,'' said Joel
Millonzi, an executive compensation specialist in New York. He said
top mutual fund managers at giant funds can make anywhere from $5
million on up.

 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even many of the guests who turned out at the Museum
of Broadcasting on Tuesday to pay tribute to William F. Buckley Jr.
on the occasion of the taping of the final broadcast of ``Firing
Line,'' his weekly program, might be forgiven for being surprised
that it was still on the air.
</P>
<P>
   After 33 years, ``Firing Line,'' the longest-running program in
television history with the same host, had long since lost its
buzz, having been supplanted by many other programs in which
outspoken conservative commentators hold forth. But to chroniclers
of Buckley's life and the conservative movement, ``Firing Line''
was the first and the most important in widely establishing
conservatism as a serious intellectual movement in America
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the program played a critical role in Buckley's signal
achievement: almost singlehandedly ``dekooking'' a conservative
movement widely identified in the 1950s and '60s with
isolationists, protectionists and bigots and catapulting it into
the mainstream of U.S. politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was opposing the hegemony of liberalism on the outside
looking in,'' said George H. Nash, the historian and author of
``The Conservative Intellectual Movement in America Since 1945''
(Intercollegiate Studies Institute, 1996). ``What `Firing Line'
represents is the opening of the door from the outside to the
inside.''
</P>
<P>
   After the landslide defeat of Barry Goldwater, the movement's
standard-bearer, in the 1964 presidential campaign, prominent
liberals like John Kenneth Galbraith declared that conservatism had
no place in U.S. politics.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley, now 74, was already well known as the defiant author of
``God and Man at Yale,'' the founder of the conservative weekly
National Review and an insurgent New York City mayoral candidate
when ``Firing Line'' first went on the air in April 1966. But the
program quickly took his celebrity to a new level, transforming him
into a cultural icon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buckley became best known not as a writer or speaker but as a
television performer,'' wrote John B. Judis in his 1988 biography,
``William F. Buckley: Patron Saint of the Conservatives.''
``Television was the medium through which he projected his own
views and personality onto the canvas of the '60s.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Firing Line'' is also seen as having blazed the trail for the
current wave of pugilistic punditry on television. The idea for a
weekly program in which Buckley would debate a liberal opponent for
an hour was first proposed by an executive at RKO, which owned
WOR-TV in New York. Buckley jumped at the chance to present his
conservative views to a wider audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot that had been said by National Review that
needed to be said face to face to its critics,'' Buckley recalled
in an interview on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning, Buckley, who was a skilled debater from his
student days at Yale, set out to eviscerate his opponents. Judis
wrote that Neal Freeman, Buckley's personal assistant at the time,
modeled the program after the Friday night fights that were then
nationally televised.
</P>
<P>
   The guest on the first ``Firing Line'' was Norman Thomas, the
Socialist and perennial presidential candidate who was 81 and
losing his eyesight. ``When you argue with a man who is old and
blind, you are pretty tough,'' said Warren Steibel, producer and
director of ``Firing Line'' since its early days. But, he added,
``it made good theater.''
</P>
<P>
   And good television. Buckley drove liberal viewers around the
bend by defending Sen. Joseph McCarthy, tarring his guests as
Communists and questioning such liberal orthodoxy as universal
voting rights in the South. With his tousled hair, blue eyes that
tended to bulge like an exotic lizard's, portentous vocabulary and
halting patrician speech, he quickly established himself as the
face of a new kind of conservatism: intelligent, urbane, witty,
cutting.
</P>
<P>
   By today's standards of political discourse it is hard to
imagine what ``Firing Line'' was like in the late 1960s and early
'70s, Judis said. ``Those shows were an extension of politics,'' he
said. ``They would not just comment on this spectator sport of
politics we have now. They were part of the political debate. That
is why ``Firing Line'' was interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckley was ripe for parody. Like the sportscaster Howard
Cosell, he became a man many viewers detested but could not stop
watching. ``I think you are finally going to displace me as the
most hated man in America,'' novelist Norman Mailer wrote to
Buckley after ``Firing Line'' took off. ``And of course the
position is bearable only if one is No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   After a few years, Buckley mellowed, becoming more generous to
his guests while losing little of his passion. (Judis wrote that
Buckley was so nasty that the program had trouble attracting guests
after its first year but Buckley and Steibel have denied this.) As
a result, his image began to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``He added a kind of charisma and sexiness to conservatism that
had never been there before,'' said Sam Tanenhaus, a contributing
editor at Vanity Fair who is preparing a biography of Buckley.
Young women flocked to him after his public appearances. The
feminist Germaine Greer flirted with him on camera. A 1973 study in
Psychology Today found that many women fantasized about Buckley
during intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Firing Line'' became a necessary stop for the leading liberal
figures of the era. Muhammad Ali, Allen Ginsberg, Jesse Jackson,
William M. Kunstler and Murray Kempton, among others, all made
appearances. Buckley was helped by the fact that he counts liberals
like Galbraith and Ira Glasser, executive director of the American
Civil Liberties Union, among his closest friends.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By putting Buckley alongside liberal celebrities, his
conservative views were given equal weight at a time when few
people took conservatives seriously and there were many fewer
outlets on television than there are today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody said I am going to apostatize as a result of seeing
`Firing Line,''' Buckley said, using one of his trademark $5 words.
``The challenge of conservatives in those years was not to convert
others to our point of view but to convince them that conservative
views weren't held by savages.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Firing Line'' retained its clout throughout the 1970s but its
influence, as well as that of National Review and Buckley's
syndicated column, began to wane after Ronald Reagan was elected
president in 1980. While Reagan called Buckley, his longtime ally,
``the most influential journalist and intellectual in our era,''
his victory occurred alongside the ascendance of a new generation
of conservative pundits like the columnist George Will.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley said that there was no particular pressure on him to
discontinue ``Firing Line,'' which was cut back to a half-hour from
an hour in the mid-1980s. But since the program had to end
sometime, he said, it might as well be at the end of the
millennium. He said he planned to continue writing his column and
books. The last ``Firing Line,'' which is the second installment of
a two-part retrospective, will be distributed to 294 PBS stations
on Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
   It seems unlikely that any conservative commentator will soon
reproduce the influence that Buckley and ``Firing Line'' had at
their peak. ``He had tremendous intelligence and wit,'' Judis said
of Buckley. ``That is a quality that is not necessarily valued now
on television. It takes time to debate someone. You don't do it in
a minute while the viewer goes from channel to channel.''

   FANTASIA-2000 (LOS ANGELES) -- The Walt Disney Co. will release
``Fantasia 2000'' on 35mm after its initial run on large-format
Imax, the company's distribution chief acknowledged. Disney had
been hush-hush about whether it would release the updated animation
classic at conventional theaters, but its holiday card -- sent to
thousands of friends, associates and vendors of the company --
inadvertently spilled the beans. On the back of the card is a

D'ALLESANDRO CRITICAL OF IOC REFORMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Their No. 1 critic was not impressed with the ``reforms''
announced by the International Olympic Committee this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key questions still have not been answered,'' said David
D'Alessandro of John Hancock, a major Olympic sponsor. ``Where is
the money coming from, and where does it go? (The IOC has) never
released a full, comprehensive financial report, and until they do,
all of this talk of reform is just talk.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro was the first one to speak out against the IOC
after the scandal surrounding the Salt Lake City bidding came to
light. He was one of the first to call for reform, but when it came
this week, he wasn't pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping for more, and I hope more will be done once (Juan
Antonio) Samaranch leaves at the end of next year,'' said
D'Alessandro. ``But that will depend on the person who takes his
place. If that person doesn't push for some meaningful reforms,
then nothing will happen in the long run. (The IOC) said they were
going to be more democratic in the way they do business. But when
you look at what happened, they are going to continue to elect
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people presently on the board vote to keep each other on
the board, and have grandfathered themselves into their positions
until they are 80 years old. They tried to make it look good by
adding some new members, but those members will have just four-year
or eight-year terms. Some of the people on the board now are only
in their 40s, so they can stay on the committee for 30 years or
more, and they will continue to manipulate the process the way they
have been doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, this is not ``reform'' at all, but just a spin
to keep the heat down. Between 2000, 2002, and 2004, when the
Olympics are held in Australia, Salt Lake City (Winter), and
Greece, the IOC will take in $5 billion. Where does it come from?
Where does it go? If the US government is sincere about Olympic
reform, they'd keep the IOC on the hot seat until they provided all
of the answers.

   This is one NFL team's character report on Rae Carruth, who now
faces first-degree murder charges in North Carolina, when he was
coming out of Colorado:
</P>
<P>
   ``A solid citizen from a single-parent home. Very supportive
mother. Father was a Navy Seal. Has extended family. Conscientious
student. Will graduate on time. Confident but not cocky. Works
hard. Very respectful person. Good self-motivation. Double major in
English and Education. Likes to write. Overall grade 8 (on scale of
10).'' Carruth took the Wonderlic Test twice, scoring 21 and 24,
which is well above average and high for someone playing the wide
receiver position.
</P>
<P>
   Go figure.

<P>
   He has Boston stamped all over him, but no one will be rooting
harder for the Eagles than Jeffrey Lurie when they play the
Patriots in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Lurie, 48, remembers seeing the first Patriots game when he was
just a kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Gino (Cappelletti) kicking a field goal, but the
star of the game was Gene Mingo of the Broncos,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lurie grew up in Newton, then attended Buckingham, Browne &AMP;
Nichols, Clark (bachelor's degree), Boston University (master's),
and Brandeis (doctorate). But despite all of the education, his
first love was sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent many a night sleeping out on Causeway Street waiting
to buy obstructed-view seats to see Orr and Esposito play for the
Bruins; or Havlicek and Cowens with the Celtics,'' Lurie said.
``Those are some of the greatest memories of my life. They are
still with me today. I think the sports figure I admired most was
Red Auerbach. He was a model for me. He didn't always make the easy
choices.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason Lurie will be rooting for the Eagles? He owns them.
``I wanted to buy the Patriots, and I almost did. I thought I had a
deal to buy the team with James Orthwein (who preceeded Bob Kraft),
but I couldn't close on it. I'm happy here in Philadelphia. I like
the people. In the long run, I think we are going to be good, and
this will be a good investment for me. I'm happy that this is what
I decided to do.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   No one could have been more disappointed than Patriots running
back Terry Allen when he got stopped on the 1-yard line last week
against the Colts. Allen needs two more touchdowns to get 10 and a
$250,000 incentive bonus. Allen took a shot when he signed for
short money, the minimum $400,000 for a veteran, at the start of
camp.
</P>
<P>
   Allen reached his first incentive last week, topping 700 yards
rushing, which kicked in a $250,000 bonus. If he gets 1,000 yards
(he has 713) by the end of the season, he'll get another $250,000.
For every two touchdowns he scores the rest of the way, another
$250,000 will be added.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, Allen got a potential big break last week when
teammate Kevin Faulk broke his ankle. Faulk and Allen were sharing
time, so now Allen will be forced to carry most of the load, giving
him a better chance at reaching his incentives.

   The NHL owners are ``going down the road'' toward allowing their
players to perform in the 2002 Winter Games, but it isn't a done
deal yet. The owners want some assurance from NBC, which will
handle the telecast, that their games will get some prime-time
treatment. In Nagano, with CBS doing the broadcast, men's hockey
was not featured. Question: If the NHL players are allowed to play,
will the three stiffs who trashed some rooms in Nagano but still
haven't had the courage to step forward and accept the blame be
allowed to play for the US team? . . . Antoine Walker, who has his
hands on the ball as much as any Celtic, averages one assist every
17 minutes, or two a game. Adrian Griffin leads the team in
rebounding, even though he's just 6 feet 5 inches. Rick Pitino
should have a rule that Walker is forbidden to take a shot above
the foul line. At least when he misses in the paint, he has a
chance to get fouled . . . Of all the players who participated in
the fabulous Ryder Cup tournament at Brookline, only two sent
thank-you notes for the treatment they recieved at the club. Mark
O'Meara and Payne Stewart.

   As long as the Bruins play their current system, they will never
score enough to be consistent winners. You can't score goals in the
NHL when your players' first thought is to get back and defend.
Somewhere along the line, Pat Burns has to turn them loose to see
what they can do in the offensive zone, or else this team isn't
going anywhere . . . At the recent major league baseball meetings,
it was revealed in an owners' financial report that only eight
teams in the league made money. The Red Sox were credited with a
profit of $5 million because they reached the American League
Championship Series vs. the Yankees, but in reality, the team broke
even because it never received the more than $5 million it was owed
by its local television broadcaster. The Sox will file a lawsuit to
try to recoup some of that money.

   Through 203 games this year, NFL officials have reviewed 157
plays with the help of instant replay. Forty-seven plays have been
reversed. The biggest flap of the season came last Monday night in
the Broncos-Jaguars game in Denver. Broncos QB Brian Griese was hit
trying to pass. Referee Gerry Austin, standing 15 feet away, ruled
an incomplete pass. Jacksonville had recovered the ball thinking it
was a fumble, and when Tom Coughlin asked for a replay, Austin
reversed his own call, making it a fumble. However, he gave the
ball back to Denver, saying he blew the whistle (thinking
originally it was an incomplete pass) when the ball hit the ground.
Well, Al Michaels and Boomer Esiason, broadcasting the game for
ABC, hit the roof and stayed on Austin's back all night. They
couldn't seem to get it through their heads that once Austin
reversed himself, the ball was a fumble, and not an incomplete
pass. And the rule is, once the whistle blows, which it did when
the ball hit the ground, the ball goes to the team that last had
possession. That was Denver. The Jacksonville player did not touch
the ball until after the whistle. Austin, after blowing the first
call, made the absolute right decision after that, and then was
villified.

   There's a very moving passage in Wally Carew's book ``Men of
Spirit, Men of Sports'' involving former Boston College basketball
coach Jim O'Brien. For the first time, O'Brien tells what happened
inside his family when his wife, Christine, died suddenly of a
heart attack in their home, leaving behind Jim, and daughters Erin
and Amy. ``Christine and I kissed each other and told each other
how much we loved one another each day. My girls and I do the same
thing. It's very important. People need to say it. People need to
hear it, too. Every single day. I don't know how to tell you this,
but for five months after Christine's death, a light bulb in one of
the bathrooms was on the verge of blowing. It flickered on and off.
We didn't change it. It was her. Christine was there. It was her
way of telling us that she was with God, and she was OK.''

   The most sought Red Sox farmhands in trade talks at the league
meetings were third baseman Wilton Veras, first baseman Dernell
Stenson, and catcher Steve Lomasney. The Sox let every team know
that John Valentin was available, and there was no interest . . .
Both the coaches and players admit the Patriots' major problem all
year on defense has been getting the other team off the field on
third down. Why, then, have the Patriots brought Ted Johnson back
to play middle linebacker, when Johnson does not play third-down
passing situations? A year ago, they let Drew Bledsoe play with a
broken finger and he went out for the year when he reinjured it.
Last week, they let Ty Law play with a broken thumb, and he's out
for the year after he reinjured it. There is no reason to put Ted
Johnson back on the field until he is 100 percent healthy, and his
injured biceps doesn't need a brace to protect it . . . Bruce
Sundlun made this space in the past as the Rhode Island governor
who almost got Bob Kraft to move the team to Providence. Sundlun,
no longer in office and closing in on 80 years of age, recently got
married for the fifth time, which led top hoop writer Bill Reynolds
to offer in his Providence Journal column: ``There is no truth to
the rumor that Sundlun is honeymooning in Viagra Falls.''

PRIMAKOV ANNOUNCES BID FOR PRESIDENCY AS PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS
NEAR  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Shortly before Russians, spread across nine time zones,
vote for a new parliament, Yevgeny Primakov, the former prime
minister and leader of an anti-Kremlin electoral bloc, announced
Friday that he would be a candidate for the presidency in the
election scheduled for June.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, 70, previously said he would not decide on a bid for
Russia's top job until after the parliamentary elections on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But in the final hours of a bitter and ugly campaign, he told an
audience of Moscow university students that he had sped up his
decision to take a stand against the ``lawlessness'' pervading the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``After much thought and after receiving thousands of letters
and telegrams, I have decided without further delay to announce
today that I shall take part in the presidential race,'' said
Primakov, whose re-entry into national politics last summer ignited
a full-scale counteroffensive by Kremlin political strategists.
</P>
<P>
   Some political analysts seized on Primakov's announcement as a
last-minute maneuver designed to galvanize supporters for his
Fatherland-All Russia political bloc, which has been slipping in
the polls, falling behind both the Communist party and a newly
concocted pro-Kremlin alliance, nicknamed Medved, or Bear. Official
election results are expected to be reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the vote Sunday is for 450 seats in the parliament's
lower house, the Duma, these elections are widely seen as a trial
run for the more critical presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, 26 parties and electoral blocs are competing for
half of the Duma seats, with the other half to be filled by
candidates, running on their own or with party affiliations, in 225
individual districts.
</P>
<P>
   As the parliamentary campaign wound down, the Kremlin's current
occupant, President Boris Yeltsin, now in the final months of his
second term, remained above the fray, while his designated heir,
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin _ now seen as a favorite in the
summer presidential race _ went on national television Friday night
urging voters to get out and vote.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov countered in a television interview Friday evening by
warning viewers to beware of Kremlin-orchestrated provocations,
which he said would be designed to keep voters away from the polls,
particularly in Moscow and St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the heightened nervousness that has accompanied
this election season, he also warned his own supporters not to
engage in any last-minute illegal campaigning that would give
authorities an excuse to penalize his political alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, who last August topped the polls as Russia's most
trusted and respected political leader, has been battered by a
barrage of negative publicity that has dominated campaign coverage
on two major television channels controlled by the Kremlin and its
allies.
</P>
<P>
   Another target has been his main political ally, Moscow Mayor
Yuri Luzhkov, who is running both for parliament and for
re-election in Russia's largest city.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov, once a potential presidential contender himself, said
Friday that he backed Primakov's decision, praising the former
prime minister as ``a wise and predictable leader.''
</P>
<P>
   When the two men joined forces last summer, their Fatherland-All
Russia alliance looked set to capitalize on popular disillusion
with the Yeltsin presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before rebel guerrillas from Chechnya launched an
attack on a neighboring region, setting in a motion a popular war
that has changed Russia's political landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The war has boosted the popularity of Putin and reset the
national political mood. According to Russian opinion polls, many
Russian voters have switched their allegiance from Primakov, seen
as a sage statesman-like figure, to Putin, 46, a former KGB officer
who is perceived as a decisive and energetic defender of Russian
interests.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Primakov has been clearly stunned by the vehemence of the media
attacks that have portrayed him as old, feeble and too close to the
Communists, who are the core of the anti-Yeltsin opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In recent statements, both Primakov and Luzhkov have gingerly
begun to question the Kremlin's handling of the Chechen war, even
as they reiterate their support for crushing the Chechen
guerrillas.

   Grigori Yavlinsky, leader of Yabloko, a liberal opposition party
that has been bitterly criticized for its more moderate stance on
the war, said Friday night that the outcome of the Chechen campaign
could determine Russia's future political stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very feeble political construction,'' he said
Friday. A failure in Chechnya ``would lead to a collapse of the
entire construction.''

ROOKIE GEORGE, DIABETES UNDER CONTROL, MAY SEE MORE FIELD TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ At halftime, he'll have to check his blood
sugar to make sure it's in control. If not, he will have a shot of
insulin.
</P>
<P>
   Tony George, a diabetic, has had to go through this procedure
for the last eight years, since he was first diagnosed with Type II
diabetes. George, a third-round pick from the University of
Florida, will likely be playing a little more than usual and may
even be the starting free safety against Philadelphia Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to test it at halftime,'' said George. ``I take it
during pregame meal and it keeps me going and regulated throughout
the game. I let my trainers know if my sugar's too high or too low,
or if I have a headache. When you've had it for eight years, you
can tell what you can do and what you can't do.''
</P>
<P>
   We saw a glimpse of George in the fourth quarter of a 20-15 loss
to the Indianapolis Colts last Sunday after Chris Carter went down
with a hamstring pull. Carter made one excellent play in the game,
knocking down a Peyton Manning pass intended for Marvin Harrison at
the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who replaced Willie Clay, was given the job without ever
having started a game in the NFL. A third-round pick out of Texas,
he had made the roster, coincidentally, following a big final
exhibition game against the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Now, George has a chance to make his mark. Some feel it's been
long overdue. While Carter hasn't played poorly, he hasn't made big
plays, either.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots held back on George because they didn't believe he
knew the defense well enough. The rookies named him their de facto
representative in camp because he is so well-spoken. At Florida,
George was regarded as a hard hitter. He hasn't had many
opportunities to show that except on special teams, where he's made
nine tackles, second-highest on the team to Larry Whigham and Marty
Moore.
</P>
<P>
   George has been wondering for some time when he'd finally get
his chance, to the point where the Patriots had fielded phone calls
from George's agent.
</P>
<P>
   George is grateful he finally has a chance to play a game he has
played every year of his life at 100 m.p.h.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been hard at all,'' said George. ``I was making
plays on special teams. It's an unfortunate incident with Chris,
and when something happens like that, another trooper has to go in.
That's my duty right now. I have a veteran defensive line and
linebackers, and Lawyer (Milloy) back there, who can show me how
it's done. They have all of that knowledge, so I just have to
follow them and do what I'm supposed to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very exciting to play against a team like Philadelphia or
any team in the NFL,'' said George, who has decent speed for a free
safety (4.5 40). ``I guess it's an opportunity. I'm just gonna do
what the coaches ask me to do. I'm grateful for whatever I get. I'm
not going to do too much or too little.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what ``style'' he can bring to the field, he said, ``I'm
going to leave it to y'all to see what kind of style I bring. I'm
not sure what I'm able to do or what I can't do.''
</P>
<P>
   He said watching on the sideline has been quite an education.
``You have to do those mental reps on the sideline, where you put
yourself in someone else's place and visualize yourself making the
play,'' said George. ``You're able to see the mistakes that are
made and how you come back from them. I've learned so much from
Chris and Lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Up to this point, the most excitement he's had in the NFL was
proposing to his girlfriend in the lobby of a hotel, down on one
knee, before the Patriots' last loss to the Miami Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   With diamond ring in hand, his girlfriend said yes and George
promptly kissed her as the families roared with approval.
</P>
<P>
   George would like to hear that roar from his coaches Sunday.

POWER PLANTS TOLD TO CUT POLLUTION TO SPARE EASTERN STATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The head of the US Environmental Protection Agency ordered 392
power plants and industrial facilities from New York to Ohio to
sharply reduce air pollution Friday, granting an unprecedented
request from officials in four eastern states that claim the
emissions worsen their smog problem.
</P>
<P>
   EPA Administrator Carol Browner's ruling _ the first time the
agency has cracked down on pollution in one state on behalf of
another _ is expected to reduce releases of smog-causing nitrogen
oxide by 510,000 tons a year in 12 states, much of which would
otherwise drift on the wind to the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   But owners of the targeted facilities immediately promised to
challenge the EPA directive, expected to cost them $950 million a
year by 2003 when it is fully effective. Lawsuits from Midwestern
and Southern utilities and states have already stalled two related
EPA initiatives to cut smog.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's action is an important first for air quality in this
country. We are providing public health protection for Americans
who live hundreds of miles away from significant sources of
pollution,'' said Browner in a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the facilities, many of them coal-burning power plants
equipped with towering stacks to spread emissions over a large
area, are not violating federal law. However, the owners haven't
installed state-of-the-art pollution controls, resulting in
pollution levels several times higher than similar plants in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Massachusetts, who petitioned EPA for help with
out-of-state pollution along with Connecticut, Pennsylvania and New
York, were jubilant. At least 25 percent of the nitrogen oxide in
Massachusetts air comes from outside New England, they said,
suggesting that the EPA order could actually reduce the number of
smoggy days from this summer's 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's ruling ranks in its impact with the surgeon general's
original finding that smoking is hazardous to your health,'' said
Attorney General Tom Reilly, who is taking the lead among
Northeastern states in defending EPA's actions.
</P>
<P>
   Added Massachusetts Environmental Affairs Secretary Robert
Durand, ``EPA is forcing some of the filthiest Midwestern power
plants to clean up so that we will no longer breathe their
secondhand smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   But David Flannery, legal counsel to the Midwest Ozone Group
that represents many of the targeted facilities, said he was
disappointed by the EPA action. He argued that there is no
scientific proof that nitrogen oxide from West Virginia can reach
Massachusetts, as Massachusetts argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting these kinds of controls in place is going to leave the
air quality in Massachusetts, for example, essentially unchanged,''
said Flannery. ``What Ms. Browner has done here is put a
one-size-fits-all control strategy in place'' when the Northeast
would benefit most from a cleanup of facilities within the region.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA ruling is the latest twist in a tense tug-of-war that
long has pitted Northeastern states against the Midwest and South.
Because the prevailing winds flow from west to east, air pollution
in Ohio can be carried to Maine, bringing acid rain and other
problems in their wake.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Connecticut suffers some of the worst smog in the
country in large measure because of pollution from New York City,
New Jersey and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   But the EPA has run into a legal brick wall in attempting to
control far-flung smog sources. In May, the US Court of Appeals in
Washington rejected plans for a tougher national standard for
ozone, a key ingredient in smog that causes lung tissue to stiffen,
calling the EPA action ``an unconstitutional delegation of power.''
</P>
<P>
   The court also stayed Browner's plan to require power plants and
industrial boilers in 22 states to slash nitrogen oxide levels, on
the grounds that it, too, exceeded EPA authority. The court is
expected to make a decision on whether the plan can proceed early
next year.
</P>
<P>
   With both proposals stalled, Browner turned to the state
requests for relief as a back-up strategy, carefully weeding out
requests that would be vulnerable to appeal. For intance, the EPA
rejected petitions from Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and Rhode
Island because smog levels in those states were not high enough.
</P>
<P>
   But the EPA agreed with Massachusetts' claim that 24 named
facilities in West Virginia aggravate smog here and ordered them to
cut nitrogen oxide releases by 76 percent. EPA called for a 50
percent cut in releases from more than 250 facilities in 12 states
whose emissions reach Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Browner conceded that Friday's ruling reduced nitrogen oxide by
less than half as much as she had hoped under the broader proposal
stayed by the court. However, she said the agency is still
considering petitions for help from three other states and
Washington, D.C. that could eliminate another 150,000 tons of
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Frank O'Donnell, the executive director of the Clean Air Trust,
a Washington environmental group, called the EPA action ``an
important start while the court cases are being resolved,'' noting
that the cleanup is good for the polluting facilities' home states,
too.

CLINTON SIGNS DISABILITY INSURANCE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Summoning the spirit of Franklin Delano Roosevelt,
President Clinton Friday signed a bill that allows people with
disabilities to go to work without losing their federal health
insurance, saying the legislation would restore the ``dignity of
work'' to the disabled and add new taxpayers to the rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Against the backdrop of the Roosevelt memorial, Clinton said the
former president, who relied on a wheelchair but mostly kept it
hidden from public view, had disproved the notion that ``being
disabled meant being unable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, in the spirit of his leadership, in the wake of his
accomplishments, we move further along on our nation's marvelous
journey of equal opportunity for all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which costs $500 million over five years, was
widely lauded by advocates for the disabled. It includes $150
million in grants to states to make it possible for people with
disabilities to hold a job without losing their Medicare or
Medicaid coverage. Disabled people whose earnings or assets are
above federal income limits will be able to buy health insurance
through Medicaid, and Medicare coverage will be extended to four
years for those in the disability insurance system who return to
work. The disabled also will be provided a ``ticket'' that can be
used to purchase services from government or private rehabilitation
programs to help them enter the workforce.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one should have to choose between taking a job and having
health care,'' Clinton said. He said the bill recognizes that
``work is at the heart of the American dream.''
</P>
<P>
   The president hailed the measure as the ``most significant
advancement'' for the disabled since President George Bush signed
the Americans with Disabilities Act into law in 1990. The sponsors
of the Work Incentives Improvement Act included Senators Edward M.
Kennedy and James M. Jeffords, a Republican from Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Vachon, a 32-year-old quadriplegic from Somersworth, N.H.,
called the signing of the new law ``a great day for us.'' In a
telephone interview, he said, ``People in our society are pretty
much judged by what they do. This will allow us to be able to go to
work, earn a living, pay taxes, become productive members of
society rather than people who kind of live off society. This gives
people with a disability a sense of self-worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna P. McNamee, 40, who is stricken with brittle bone disease,
came from her home outside of Cleveland in Willoughby, Ohio, to
attend the signing ceremony. She called the new law ``a dream come
true.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``The door is unlocked, it's open, and a whole new
world lies beyond it.''

MACAO TO QUIETLY RETURN TO CHINESE ORBIT

<TEXT>
<P>
   MACAO _ At the stroke of midnight Sunday a small European
country that once ruled territories across the globe will
relinquish to China the southern port city of Macao _ the first
European colony in Asia, and now the last.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal will return to China the last bit of land that it ceded
to foreign powers during the era of European empire building, and
at the same moment, draw the curtain on 450 years of Western
expansion in the Far East.
</P>
<P>
   It is a proud, historic moment for China, one the leadership is
trumpeting to boost nationalistic pride and to send a message of
unity to restive provinces such as Tibet and Xinjiang, where
separatism runs high. A digital countdown clock towers over
Tiananmen Square thousands of miles north in Beijing, where a giant
television screen will broadcast the handover live, while a crowd
expected to total 30,000 people celebrates in the square _ 12 times
the number who will attend the ceremony in Macao.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the 1997 British handover of the nearby but far
wealthier port of Hong Kong _ which was broadcast worldwide and
commemorated with parties as far away as Helsinki _ Macao's return
is getting little attention.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, the handover of this tiny outpost has more symbolic
value than economic or strategic significance. But it is in many
ways a bigger deal for China, which is overcoming old humiliations,
and for Portugal, which is regaining dignity lost in ugly exits
from its African colonies, than it is for Macao itself.
</P>
<P>
   In recent decades, this odd mix of a quaint, cobblestoned
tourist town and a tawdry casino haven has enjoyed easy border
crossings and good relations with the mainland, leaving most locals
blase about the coming change. In contrast to worries that clouded
the handover in Hong Kong, Macao's people seem unconcerned that
they might lose freedoms under communist sovereignty. Many even
expect life to be better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Macao handover will be a non-event, just a party. For
locals, it's not the end of anything or the beginning of anything,
because there's a sense of continuity,'' said Luis Quintaneiro,
director of the Institute of European Studies in Macao. In the last
two months, outgoing Portuguese Governor Vasco Joachim Rocha Viera
and incoming Beijing-appointed Chief Executive Edmund Ho, a local
banker, ``have done everything together except sleeping,'' he
quipped.
</P>
<P>
   The return of Macao 2 1/2 years after Hong Kong also feeds a
drumbeat of inevitability for Beijing. China will likely turn up
the pressure now on the last missing piece of its historical
empire: the island of Taiwan, where Nationalist Chinese retreated
after losing a civil war to the Communists in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   ``Macao is just a snack between the two main courses of Hong
Kong and Taiwan,'' one European observer said drily. ``It will be
used as propaganda in the mainland, and as a warning to Taiwan to
get in line _ because they are next.''
</P>
<P>
   At least for now, though, Beijing's spotlight is on this tiny
outcropping on the western edge of the Pearl River Delta in
southeastern China. Settled by Portuguese sailors in 1557, Macao
became the key Far East entrepot along the trade routes that made
Portugal rich. It was eclipsed 300 years later by Hong Kong, 38
miles away, which had a deeper port that could accommodate larger
ships.
</P>
<P>
   Macao then declined into a sleepy, neglected backwater that the
poet W.H. Auden dismissed as ``a weed from Catholic Europe'' where
``nothing serious can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Its economy was finally resuscitated a few decades ago by
legalized gambling and light manufacturing. Today, most of the
factories have migrated to China, where labor costs are lower and
taxes can be nil.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal tried twice before to give Macao back _ once following
destabilizing riots in 1966, and again when Lisbon rid itself of
other colonies in 1975. Both times China declined, and it was only
after diplomatic relations were established in 1979 that
negotiations over Macao began.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 50,000 people cross the border daily between Macao and
mainland China _ many to work or simply to shop for groceries,
which are cheaper in China. On holidays, that number can swell to
100,000 _ equivalent to one-fifth of Macao's tiny population.
</P>
<P>
   The crossing point resembles a bustling commuter bus station
more than a fortified border; people stream in and out all day
long, and buses return them back to the center of Macao within
minutes. There's no barbed wire, and just a few guards.
</P>
<P>
   A pastel yellow colonial archway with a Portuguese inscription
separates Macao from China, but aside from the hustling vendors,
the less fashionable clothes, and more garbage, things are not very
different on the Chinese side.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lai, 18, an unemployed Macao resident, returned Friday
evening from the Chinese side after an hour-long trip to deliver a
new telephone to relatives. Asked about the handover, Lai said he
had given it little thought, since he, and everyone he knows,
already spends so much time in China.
</P>
<P>
   His only concerns were very down-to-earth _ nothing to do with
the questions of civil rights and political freedoms that swirled
around Hong Kong: ``I assume it'll be just like Hong Kong, where
you can still bet at horse races and go dancing.''
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Ferreira Wu, 59, was the first Macao businessman to set
up a knitting factory in China five years after the mainland's
economic reforms began in 1979. Today, the self-made millionaire
has 90 percent of his business in China, and harbors nothing but
enthusiasm for the handover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chinese people understand each other's way of thinking,'' said
Wu. ``Under the Portguese, there are barriers to business created
by language and bureaucracy. . . Everything's conducted in
Portuguese in this administration, and most people have no idea
what's going on, no affinity with the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in Hong Kong, where the mass media and pro-democracy
politicians drew international attention to their worries over
human rights, Macao does not have a critical press nor a strong
opposition. There is just one pro-democracy politician in the
legislature, and few outside pressure groups.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Ng, the legislator, accepts as inevitable that the new
administration will limit certain rights, as has happened in Hong
Kong. ``The government is controlled by Portugal now. Later it will
be controlled by Edmund Ho _ and of course he will obey Beijing,''
Ng said resignedly.
</P>
<P>
   China ``doesn't have to put a hand on Macao, because Macao is
already under control,'' added Herbert Yee, a political science
professor at Hong Kong Baptist University. Macao society is already
pro-China, he said, especially since the 1966 riots.
</P>
<P>
   Locals have several theories as to why Macao feels closer to
China than Hong Kong ever did. One is that because Macao's
residents are largely from rural China and have a lower standard of
living than Hong Kong's, they may be concerned mostly about
livelihood issues. ``Hong Kong's urban professionals were afraid of
losing their professional freedoms and rights. In Macao, people are
more concerned with the basics,'' Wu said.
</P>
<P>
   Another theory is that thanks to centuries of Portuguese
influence and the slow pace of life here, Macao's people are simply
more relaxed than Hong Kong's British-educated notoriously
stressed-out masses, and will take change in stride.
</P>
<P>
   A third factor is that Macao's people are socially conservative,
Yee said, and expect that China will crack down on rising crime and
vice.
</P>
<P>
   As factories have migrated north, tourism became Macao's main
industry, bringing in 40 percent of Macao's revenue. But in recent
years, turf wars between crime syndicates linked to casinos and
prostitution have culminated in gangland killings that tarnished
Macao's reputation, and scared off tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Ng Gok-hung, 50, a jewelry shop employee, echoed the views of
many here. ``As far as I can see, it's good that Macao is going
back to China. Macao is tucked in next to China anyway, and without
China, we wouldn't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tourist city, so security is really important,'' he
added, pointing at the uniformed guard at the door. ``We all think
it should be a lot safer under the Chinese.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   GORAZDEVAC, Yugoslavia _ Zivko Maksic walks around this village
as if he were taking exercise in a prison yard. An electrician, he
used to work at the beer distillery in Pec, about six miles away,
but now it is too dangerous to travel there. In fact, he cannot
even tend his fields, less than a mile from the village. When he
tries, neighboring Albanians shoot at him.
</P>
<P>
   Maksic, 54, is almost philosophical about his narrowed world.
``The land we have that's close, we work that,'' he said. ``But the
land farther on isn't safe. We tried to work it but they attacked
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Maksic is a beefy man who looks pale, ill and exhausted. He and
his friends Radomir Jeremic, 36, and Sinisa Jovovic, 22, were
standing chatting idly on a recent day, under a low roof against a
freezing drizzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no access to the town, that's the hardest thing,''
Jovovic said, referring to Pec. He is single, but cannot possibly
think about getting married. He had a girlfriend in Pec but
``that's finished now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs in this last remaining Serbian village near Pec are
surrounded by hostile Albanians and guarded by Italian troops from
the international peacekeeping force that arrived in June. The
troops have checkpoints at every road into the village to protect
this enclave of ``multi-ethnicity'' in western Kosovo, but they do
little patrolling.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is shooting nearly every night, an effort to
scare the Serbian villagers, and Albanians often cut off the
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The other night, when a grenade went off and broke the windows
of the last operating coffee shop, the Italians were nowhere to be
found, Maksic said. When asked about the attack, the Italian
captain, who would not give his name, asked in apparent innocence,
``Oh, is that what happened?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the easygoing Italians are popular here. Residents cannot
imagine how they could live without the protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs here are OK,'' the Italian captain said. ``Our
problems are with the Albanians.''
</P>
<P>
   In the windows of a nearby shop, there was a pathetic collection
of goods, all from Serbia: vodka and fruit brandy, filthy cans of
tinned fish, some salt, cheap cigarettes and ``Only!'' brand cola
and orange soda.
</P>
<P>
   Pec, like the rest of Kosovo, is overflowing with goods from
Albania and Macedonia. But the Italians say they have better things
to do than to shop for the Serbs of Gorazdevac. German troops do
bring in fresh bread from a bakery they have restarted in their
zone, near Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   But the only vegetables available are those the residents can
grow or preserve. There are no newspapers, nor access to any
Serbian-language media _ print or broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a few protected convoys to Pec, Maksic said.
``But they attack the buses with stones,'' he said. ``Two buses
went through Pec and they broke all the windows, and now people are
frightened to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav government helps a little. Pensions are paid on
time but do not go very far. A truck convoy comes about every 10
days, bringing supplies and animal feed, but it is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Other than farming, there is not much to do here. The only
factory in town, which made cheap shoes, shut down five years ago.
The peacekeepers sometimes pay residents 2 German marks an hour
(about $1.10) to clean up common areas or about 5 marks an hour
(plus fuel) if residents provide their own tractors.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the tension has stemmed from the return of Serbs to
Gorazdevac. Some fled at the end of the war and have come back;
others have come from other parts of Kosovo. Some have come to
stay; more have looked around, then left again.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   By the end of October, about 600 Serbs were living here, about
60 percent of the population before the war this spring, but many
Kosovo Albanians are convinced there are war criminals among the
Serbs who use the protection of the peacekeepers' convoys to cover
their movements. The peacekeepers have been reluctant to escort
Albanians through Gorazdevac, even from nearby Pocesce, whose only
access road to Pec runs through here.
</P>
<P>
   In a report by the human rights division of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, Gorazdevac is called ``perhaps
the most delicately balanced single issue'' in western Kosovo. ``It
was also the most likely to initiate violence,'' the report
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the Serbs here deny deep feelings of guilt or
responsibility for the mistreatment of Albanians by Serbian troops
and militias, or at least they do not express such feelings to a
foreigner. ``The Albanians started this long ago,'' Maksic said.
``They wanted a Kosovo republic, to leave Yugoslavia. They asked
for too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Just outside the village are some burned-out homes where
Albanians once lived. The Serbs say they know little about what
happened. Jovovic suggested that the Albanians ``moved out on their
own'' and that to prevent having Serbs use the houses, ``they
burned them themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   When told how bizarre that sounded, Jovovic shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   Milijanko Jeremic, 45, and no relation to Radomir, said the
problems all stemmed from ``two policemen who came from Serbia
during the war, and they made all the problems.'' The villagers, he
insisted, were guilty of nothing. He shrugged. ``It was war.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Of course he knew the Albanians suffered, Milijanko Jeremic
said. But now, he said: ``All the Turks, the Croats and the Serbs
are being pushed out. It was a war, and a nasty war. But should
only one people live here now? Is that what America wants? I have
nothing in Serbia. My house and my country are here.'' (Serbs often
call local Muslims Turks, a relic of Ottoman rule.)
</P>
<P>
   He kicked at the grass. ``We're not pessimists,'' he said, then
laughed. ``Of course, we're not big optimists, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Bozidar Radulovic, 65, said there was nothing good for anyone
during the war. ``But now we're in a bad situation,'' he said. ``We
live like in a quarantine, on a reservation.'' He pointed down the
road to the coffeehouse, where the grenade exploded.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's lots of pressure on us,'' he continued. ``They provoke
us. That shop was the only place we go out and they bombed it.
We're afraid to go anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly there was an eerie screaming. In the center of the
village, in a yard, Jovovic was helping Maksic slaughter a pig. As
the blood pumped from its throat, the pig continued to squeal.
</P>
<P>
   Aco Dakic, 57, fixing the tiles on his roof in the rain, barely
looked up at the sound. He said about 10 houses of Serbian families
had been burned on the outskirts of the village and about six that
belonged to Albanians. His wife helped hold the ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Will he stay in Gorazdevac? Dakic said: ``Well, my wife wants to
stay. Anyway, where can we go? We don't have anywhere else to go.
Whatever we have, we have here. For 35 years, whatever I could earn
or build is here.''
</P>
<P>
   They have three daughters, however _ 16, 19 and 20. ``And what
kind of life will they have here?'' Dakic asked. His wife turned
away. He swore an oath. ``We don't know anything,'' he said
bitterly. ``We have no information.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, who had
been popular with Kosovo's Serbs, Dakic said: ``That's a political
thing. I don't want to get into it.''
</P>
<P>
   What about his Albanian neighbors? Dakic looked upset. ``We were
fine, almost like brothers,'' he said. ``But the Albanian leaders
and our leaders needed to find a common language, not violence.''
</P>
<P>
   He stopped, then asked: ``Why did NATO come? To push the Serbs
out? I can't understand why they can't put things in order.''

DIVIDED COUNCIL APPROVES ARMS INSPECTION SYSTEM FOR IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A divided Security Council voted Friday to
create a new arms inspection system for Iraq with the promise to
President Saddam Hussein that sanctions against his country could
be suspended within a year and eventually lifted if he cooperates.
</P>
<P>
   The plan immediately removes the ceiling on the amount of oil
Iraq may sell abroad _ now set at $5.26 billion every six months _
to buy food and necessary goods for a population struggling under
economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   It also relaxes some controls on Iraq's import of medical,
agricultural and educational supplies, though the sanctions _
including a ban on international flights except for pilgrimages to
Mecca _ formally remain in place.
</P>
<P>
   An arduous process of persuading Iraq to respond to these
incentives to cooperate with the arms inspection plan will now
begin.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's envoy at the United Nations, Saeed Hassan, restated his
government's earlier rejection of the resolution. Iraq had already
insisted it would not permit any U.N. inspectors back into Iraq and
demanded that the sanctions _ which under terms ending the 1991
Persian Gulf war are to remain in place until Iraq proves it has
eliminated weapons of mass destruction _ be unconditionally halted.
Iraq has barred inspectors since last December after American and
British warplanes struck Baghdad for not cooperating with the
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on the 15-member Security Council was 11 in favor with
four abstentions. At the decisive moment, France broke ranks with
the United States and the European Union and abstained along with
Russia, China and Malaysia, which holds a nonpermanent Security
Council seat.
</P>
<P>
   With only two of the five permanent council members voting in
favor, some diplomats predicted that Iraq will be emboldened in its
resistance to the plan. The two permament members who voted for it,
Britain and the United States, are portrayed in Iraq as the
country's worst enemies, and they now appear isolated.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Burleigh, the departing American deputy chief
representative, who has negotiated the Iraqi issue for the United
States here for more than a year, called the vote ``a profoundly
important moment for the Security Council'' and added that what is
now required of Iraq ``could not be more clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq, he said, will be required to allow weapons inspectors to
return, to maximize benefits for the Iraqi people from its earnings
and to cooperate in the accounting for Kuwaitis missing since the
1990 invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vote today was not unanimous,'' Burleigh told the council,
``but no member asserts that Iraq has met its obligations under the
council's resolutions. No council member argues that Iraq has
disarmed as required.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir Jeremy Greenstock of Britain, president of the council for
December and the sponsor of Friday's resolution, called its
adoption ``an exceptional achievement'' in linking relief for
Iraqis living under sanctions with assigned disarmament tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regret,'' he said, ``that on this point, some have been
more inclined to listen to the voice of the Iraqi leadership than
the needs of the Iraqi people.''
</P>
<P>
   British and American diplomats played down the abstentions,
saying that the important fact was that no nation voted against the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of arms control experts said that whether or not
Iraq eventually agrees to the stationing of inspectors and the
installation of sophisticated monitoring devices, the damage is
already done as far as close surveillance of Iraq is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   To arms control experts, the mystery is why the Clinton
administration agreed to these more lenient provisions, or how
American officials allowed themselves to be drawn into compromises
that in the end did not deliver a united Security Council. Many
believe that compromise was pointless, given strong Russian and
Chinese opposition to sanctions and France's unwillingness to
jeopardize its commercial and diplomatic relations with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Gambia's representative, Baboucar-laise Jagne, reflecting on
more than a year of debate on how to deal with Iraq since the last
inspectors left a year ago, called the resolution ``the lowest
common denominator.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a sense among many diplomats and officials here
that the Clinton administration does not want the problem of Iraq
to resurface in an election year. Even if Iraq accepted the plan,
it is unlikely that inspections could resume until late 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear
Arms Control in Washington, said in an interview that under the new
plan ``a much greater amount of equipment is going to go to Iraq
without anybody looking at it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We know already that the Iraqis have abused the medical
exception to import things that can be used to make nuclear
weapons,'' he said. ``Under the new system there is going to be
this whole category of things that don't have to be individually
approved. If the past is any guide, you have to assume that a lot
of those things will be useful for making weapons, and nobody will
be the wiser.''
</P>
<P>
   Milhollin, who reported recently in The New Yorker about an
Iraqi order last year for half a dozen lithotripters, said that
this was an example of how Baghdad may be trying to hide purchases
intended for building weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The lithotripters, sophisticated machines for pulverizing kidney
stones, require electronic switches that produce a high-power burst
of electricity _ enough to trigger a nuclear bomb if 32 of them are
used, Milhollin said. In buying the lithotripters, Iraq tried to
get 120 extra switches from Siemens, the German electronics
company, which turned over the order to a supplier, the Thomson-CSF
company of France, at which point the French government stepped in
and barred the sale.
</P>
<P>
   The case suggests that the French are aware of Iraq's continuing
efforts to assemble the components of nuclear weapons. Moreover,
Iraq is blocking routine inspections of its low-enriched uranium
and natural uranium stocks by the International Atomic Energy
Agency, raising speculation about what it may be trying to hide.
Yet President Jacques Chirac of France said in an interview this
week that nuclear weapons are no longer an issue in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   An informal discussion paper put together by the experts at
UNSCOM _ the U.N. Special Commission that was created after the
Persian Gulf war to disarm Iraq and dismantle industries that could
rebuild biological, chemical and missile systems _ said that there
should be cause for alarm also in a Security Council decision to
remove from Friday's resolution an earlier provision calling for
the new monitoring system to include UNSCOM inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Without some institutional memory to augment the archives that
the new commission will inherit, experts say, inspectors may not
know what questions must be asked of Iraq, especially on biological
and chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   UNSCOM inspectors also complain that the new resolution turns
the burden of proof upside down. Where Iraq had formerly been
expected to set out the tasks it would accomplish _ like accounting
for certain materials or equipment _ which could be accepted or
rejected by UNSCOM, the new system calls for the tasks to be
assigned by inspectors. That allows Iraq to meet only those
requirements, while concealing other activities outside the purview
of the list.
</P>
<P>
   Like Milhollin and other independent arms control experts,
UNSCOM inspectors fear that blanket permission to import certain
relief goods will inevitably be used by the Iraqis to buy equipment
or material usable in making arms. A lifting of controls over spare
parts used in the oil industry could also allow what experts call
``dual use'' items suitable for civilian or military projects to
flow relatively easily into Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   At the Nuclear Control Institute in Washington, Paul L.
Leventhal, president of the independent organization, said that
once in the country, clandestine equipment for a range of tasks
including enriching uranium for use in bombs, could be hidden in
what look like ordinary factories.
</P>
<P>
   International experts who follow Iraq in a number of agencies
and private institutes believe that Iraq's Military Industrial
Commission has reassembled some manufacturing processes critical to
making a range of prohibited weapons. Scientists and researchers
who built Iraqi weapons before 1991 are also available to the Iraqi
government, some of them held as virtual hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution passed Friday creates a new organization to be
called the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission.
It will have an executive chairman to be appointed within 30 days
by Secretary-General Kofi Annan and approved by the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new resolution, a ``college of commissioners'' will be
created to review the work of the new monitoring system. Within the
first 45 days on the job, the executive chairman must submit an
organizational plan for the staffing and administration of the
commission and its work in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Not later than 60 days after inspectors from the new commission
and the International Atomic Energy Agency have started working in
Iraq, the commission is to draw up a work program, listing tasks to
be accomplished by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution says that what is required of Iraq ``shall be
clearly defined and precise.'' It is this provision that concerns
arms control experts who say it leaves inspectors little room to
maneuver if they see something unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   Once the monitoring systems have been working for 120 days with
Iraqi cooperation, sanctions on Iraq can be suspended for renewable
periods of 120 days. Financial controls and import surveillance
except on newly excluded items will continue. The existing ``oil
for food'' program, which has allowed Iraq to sell oil to buy
civilian goods, will be folded into the new resolution.

<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ Every day this week, the war in southern
Lebanon wore on as usual, with mortars, rockets and air attacks.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps more noteworthy is what did not happen, especially
after a barrage by Israeli-backed troops injured 20 Lebanese
schoolchildren on Thursday. The usual quid pro quo would be a
strike into Israel by Lebanese guerrillas. But with Syria and
Israel holding peace talks in Washington, the guerrillas held back.
</P>
<P>
   The reason appears to be that Syria is determined to keep hopes
for peace alive. Syria controls the guerrillas' access to weapons,
and followers of the war say they have no doubt that Syria has made
clear to the fighters that this is time to hold back.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some basic guidelines, and one of them is, `Don't
get the Syrians in trouble,''' said Timor Goksel, a senior adviser
to the U. N. peacekeeping force here, which has tried and failed to
keep peace in Lebanon since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lebanon more than anywhere else remains the crossroads
that could derail the quest for a broader peace. And expressing
relief that Thursday's attacks had not been followed by an ugly
spiral, experts caution that the atmosphere remains extremely
tense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we dodge a bullet every day,'' said one analyst in
Beirut, who out of concern for the delicacy of the situation and
the peace talks would speak only on condition that he not be
identified further.
</P>
<P>
   For years the militias, which are run by Hezbollah, the Party of
God, have served as Syrian proxies, launching attacks that have
shown Israel the price of occupying Arab land, even while Syria's
own border with Israel along the Golan Heights remains quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is Hezbollah's main patron and arms supplier, but the
weapon pass through Damascus, and Syria has the hand on the spigot.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while Syria has great influence here, it does not exert
direct control over Hezbollah, and the two do not share interests.
</P>
<P>
   What worries many people is that Hezbollah, which aspires to a
greater political role in Lebanon, may prove more interested in
showcasing itself as the vanguard of Lebanese resistance than in
respecting Syrian orders.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, Thursday's test seems to suggest that the
guerrillas recognize that this would be the wrong time for
defiance. Hezbollah's secretary-general, Hassan Nasrallah, told
dinner guests Thursday that his group would ``settle for a warning
to the Zionists,'' even while arguing that the wounding of the
schoolchildren would justify rocket raids into northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The show of restraint brought sighs of relief in Israel Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Along the northern border, citizens emerged from bomb shelters.
Foreign Minister David Levy, who took part in the talks with Syria
in Washington, said the message he heard there was that Damascus
would ``fight against anyone who would try to break up the talks.''
</P>
<P>
   Syria has long tried to have things two ways in Lebanon: By
allowing Hezbollah to operate freely, it has put pressure on
Israel. But Syria has also set ground rules for Hezbollah that most
of the time have confined the war in southern Lebanon to clashes in
the narrow, rocky swath occupied by Israel since 1978 _ what Israel
calls its security zone.
</P>
<P>
   There have been exceptions, most recently in June, when an
Israeli attack in response to crossborder raids by Hezbollah killed
22 Lebanese civilians and knocked out power to much of Beirut. Many
people here feared that the shelling of the schoolyard Thursday by
the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army might set off a similar
spiral.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, however, all sides seem to have acted with caution
for fear of spoiling what feels to many like a historic moment,
with Syria and Israel back at the bargaining table for the first
time in nearly four years.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the shelling, Israel had apologized for what it
said was a mistake by its Lebanese counterparts. And in Washington
the president's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said in a
television interview: ``We certainly urged Syria to use its
influence to bring about restraint from Hezbollah.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time Israel and Syria held face-to-face talks, between
1993 and 1996, southern Lebanon served as a kind of sideshow where
Syria would sometimes seek to put pressure on Israel by authorizing
Hezbollah to increase the level of violence, including crossborder
rocket attacks. But an Israeli military offensive in Lebanon in
1996, with 18 days of air and artillery strikes, indicated that
Israel would no longer accept such a pressure campaign, and Syria
seems hesitant to try to influence the current talks in the same
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon was not represented at this week's talks. Its
representatives are expected to join sometime after the
negotiations resume on Jan. 3, but the country's foreign policy is
controlled by Syria, which maintains 30,000 troops here, meaning
that Lebanon's future is largely in Syrian hands.

REGULATORS FINE COCA-COLA BOTTLER IN ITALY $16 MILLION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Austria, Denmark, Germany, Britain)   By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the latest blow to the world's best-known brand, Italian
regulators Friday fined the bottler for the Coca-Cola Co. in Italy
more than $16 million after finding that it had engaged in unfair
practices.
</P>
<P>
   The fine amounts to about 3 percent of sales in Italy this year
but is less than half the maximum penalty. It will be paid by
Coca-Cola, which owns 51 percent of the bottler, Coca-Cola
Beverages. The bottler was also ordered to eliminate some discounts
in its exclusive contracts with supermarkets, a move that could
dampen its business.
</P>
<P>
   More troublesome, the penalty hints of obstacles to a planned
merger by the bottler. The ruling, released Friday in 200 pages by
the Italian Antitrust Authority, suggests that ``European
regulators will probably take a hard line with Coke and CCB,'' Adam
Spielman, a beverage stocks analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, said
in a note to investors.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Beverages, which was spun off from Coca-Cola Amatil in
February 1998, has announced plans to merge with the far more
profitable Hellenic Bottling, of Athens. If the European Union
blocked the merger, Spielman wrote, it would be ``extremely
negative for CCB shares.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola said it would appeal the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Enrico Nardulli, the chairman of Coca-Cola Beverages in Italy,
said the bottler was ``very respectful'' of the decision but called
it ``inconsistent with Italian and European competition laws and
with commercial practices widely accepted in Italy as well as in
other parts of Europe and around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The fine was the second-biggest ever from the Italian Antitrust
Authority, which in October fined Italy's two largest wireless
telephone companies five times the amount to be paid by Coke after
declaring them guilty of collusion. That decision is being
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Another investigation into Coke's practices is continuing after
July raids by European regulators on Coke offices in Austria,
Denmark and Germany, as well as on Coca-Cola Beverages' office in
London.
</P>
<P>
   Under European Union law, a company that has a dominant position
in a business cannot offer certain discounts to retailers and
wholesalers for exclusive contracts because they may inhibit small
players unfairly. Coke maintains that it is not dominant in Italy
when all non-alcoholic beverages are counted. The Italian
government counters that Coke has 80 percent of the cola market,
making it far and away the largest player.
</P>
<P>
   According to Beverage Digest, an industry publication, Coca-Cola
has 45.8 percent of the Italian soft drink market, compared with
5.9 percent for Pepsi-Cola. Even in its own annual report,
Coca-Cola estimates its Italian market share at nearly four times
that of its nearest competitor.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian investigation began last year, after complaints from
Coca-Cola's chief rival, PepsiCo, and an Italian supermarket chain,
Esselunga SpA.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the Italian authorities released a report describing
some business practices at Coca-Cola that they found objectionable.
These included offering discounts to retailers that agreed to carry
only Coca-Cola products, more discounts for retailers that expanded
Coke displays and yearend bonuses to wholesalers that carried only
Coca-Cola. In addition, the report said Coca-Cola had a plan ``to
expel Pepsi'' from the marketplace by encouraging wholesalers to
handle only Coke products in fountain accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian supermarket chain said Coke representatives had told
it to invest heavily in display cases and refrigerator equipment if
it wanted to sell Coke. That investment, Esselunga said, would
prevent it from making a profit.
</P>
<P>
   The fine announced Friday amounted to 3 percent of Coca-Cola
Beverages' sales during the 14 months of the investigation. Some
analysts had speculated that Coke and its bottler could be subject
to a fine as high as 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Though the fine is relatively small for the giant beverage
company, Coca-Cola has had a difficult year dealing with the global
economic slowdown, a European recall and some racial issues at its
Atlanta headquarters, capped by a discrimination lawsuit and the
resignation of its highest-ranking black executive. On Dec. 6,
Coca-Cola's chairman and chief executive, M. Douglas Ivester, said
he would step down next year. Coke's board said he would be
replaced by Douglas N. Daft, who recently said that smoothing over
European relations was one of his priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need this like a hole in the head,'' said Emanuel
Goldman, who tracks global consumer products companies for Merrill
Lynch. ``Here and there, the image of the company has been under
attack. The image of the company is crucial going forward.''

   The Real Thing &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instead of properties, there are old-time soda bottles and
nostalgic ads. Instead of houses, there are six-packs. The big
money is in vending machines, not hotels.
</P>
<P>
   It's Coca-Cola Monopoly, a custom version of the familiar board
game with brand imagery everywhere, from the playing pieces (a Coke
truck, a bottle cap) to the board and the play money. It is
available in some stores and is officially for anyone 8 and over.
</P>
<P>
   But several experts wondered whether the game was smart public
relations for a company that is fighting antitrust accusations on
two continents, was fined $16 million in Italy last week over its
competitive tactics and runs into hostile regulators with almost
any acquisition it tries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did they come out with a (italics)Monopoly(end italics)
game?'' mused Emanuel Goldman, a global consumer-products analyst
for Merrill Lynch who is more of a Scrabble buff himself. ``What's
wrong with Rummi-Kub? Or Boggle?''
</P>
<P>
   A Coca-Cola spokesman, Bob Bertini, said the game, part of the
company's licensing program, was ``really intended to be an
enjoyable, fun board game that's played by millions of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi shareholders may not find the game's inherent
scorched-earth mentality all that amusing. ``The point is to
bankrupt the other players,'' said Lee Weisenthal of the United
States Monopoly Association. ``You start off theoretically even. In
time, those that are most successful drive out those that are
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola is the first soft-drink company to get its own version
of Monopoly, which is also available in theme editions for cities,
colleges, NASA, Nascar racing, Corvette cars, Harley-Davidson
motorcycles and others. USAopoly, the California company that makes
many special editions under license from Hasbro, says Coke's is one
of its better sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Brochstein, the executive editor of The Licensing Letter,
said the game, which he does not expect to see on sale in the
European Union, was all about marketing. Though its overall
quarterly profits have declined for two years, Coca-Cola is one of
the top-earning American companies in licensing revenue, according
to Brochstein _ much of it from old ads and other nostalgia items
like those depicted in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's be honest, who would collect modern Coca-Cola logos?''
he said. ``The classic imagery is what carries it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bertini said Coca-Cola had no other board-game plans. But one
industry expert had a thought. ``Next year, if results improve,''
said John D. Sicher, editor of Beverage Digest, ``they could try
Candyland.''

 By MARC LACEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With advocates for the disabled gathered around him
at the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, President Clinton signed
landmark legislation Friday that could allow millions of people
with disabilities to enter the work force by lifting restrictions
on their health care coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates consider the legislation the most significant step for
the disabled since the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990. The
law expands Medicaid and Medicare so that people with disabilities
will continue to receive health insurance coverage once they go to
work.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton signed the legislation, called the Work Incentives
Improvement Act, at the base of the larger-than-life bronze of
Roosevelt, whom the president has called the greatest chief
executive of the century for his attention to social programs and a
safer world. Roosevelt had polio and, unknown to most Americans at
the time, used a wheelchair for much of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his time, Roosevelt felt he needed to keep his wheelchair
from public view,'' Clinton said. ``Most people believed being
disabled meant being unable. He proved them wrong every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the previous law, disabled people often lost Medicaid and
Medicare coverage because their income rose when they went to work.
Even with private insurance from their employers, they often could
not afford the costly health care or medical equipment they
required.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which won broad bipartisan support in Congress,
changes rules that discourage many disabled people from working.
Under the current system, fewer than 1 percent of the eight million
disabled people of working age who receive benefits from Social
Security and Supplemental Security Income work.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the primary argument for the legislation was a
human one: to prevent people from having to choose between work and
health care. But he said the legislation also made economic sense.
``One way we can keep this economic expansion going is to take it
to people and places who aren't part of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   James Sullivan, 38, of Hudson, N.H., introduced Clinton,
recounting how he had joined the ranks of the disabled two days
before his 18th birthday, when he broke his neck in a diving
accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``This system, which basically makes people stay at home and
punishes them when they work, is a crazy one,'' said Sullivan, who
is eager to get a job in the telecommunications industry. ``There
is an untapped population of Americans with disabilities who are
dying to get back to work.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, with provisions that will be phased in,
provides $150 million for grants to encourage states to allow
disabled workers to buy into Medicaid. It sets aside $250 million
to help obtain Medicaid coverage for people who are not so disabled
that they cannot work.
</P>
<P>
   Leye Jeannette Chrzanowski, who runs the Disability News Service
in Chantilly, Va., and has a neurological disorder, considered the
legislation groundbreaking. But she could have done without all the
symbolic references to Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of people with spinal cord injuries are very sensitive to
temperature,'' Ms. Chrzanowski said, bracing herself from the cold.
``It's aesthetically pleasing to have FDR behind us but with the
temperature like this we all ought to be inside.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Dow Jones industrial average, powered by a jump
in General Electric after it announced a 3-for-1 stock split,
flirted with a new high Friday but then gave up the gains in a
selloff at the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the afternoon, the Dow was up 138 points to 11,383,
surpassing its record close of 11,326.04 on Aug. 25. But the
average plummeted at the end of the day and wound up inching only
12.54 points higher, to 11,257.43.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-heavy Nasdaq index, which was up as much as 81
points at Friday's opening, also slumped in the afternoon. But it
still rose 38 points, or 1.02 percent, to 3,753.06, its 10th new
high since Thanksgiving. The Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stock
rose 2.25 points, to 1,421.03, just 12.27 points from the record of
1,433.30 it reached on Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   There was no news to trigger the selloff late Friday. Analysts
said they did not think the selling was a result of the expiration
of the futures contracts and options on stock indexes and the
options on individual stocks, which is known as triple witching.
That did contribute, however, to a day of record trading volume on
the New York Stock Exchange as 1.35 billion shares changed hands.
For the month so far, trading volume is averaging more than 1
billion shares a day.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Galvin, the chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin
&AMP; Jenrette, said the selloff could reflect the ``wrestling match''
going on between investors who have made huge gains this year and
are selling now to protect them, and the buying from money managers
who are trying to dress up their portfolios by buying the
better-performing stocks of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The performance came as interest rates surged to their highest
level in more than two years. For the week, the Dow and the S&AMP;P
rose less than a third of a percentage point, while the Nasdaq
leapt 3.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Because the economy continues to grow briskly despite three rate
increases by the Federal Reserve this year, more and more analysts
are now predicting that the Federal Reserve will raise its
short-term interest rate target a quarter of a percentage point in
February and another quarter of a point before summer.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the fact that the Nasdaq set its 54th record of the
year and the Dow and the S&AMP;P are near records, the stock market's
performance _ outside of technology stocks _ is still sluggish and
many stocks have been left out.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Dow first crossed 11,000 on May 7, it has risen only 2
percent, which means that almost all of its 22.6 percent gain for
the year came by early May. For the S&AMP;P 500 index, which is more
heavily weighted with tech stocks than the Dow, the rise since May
7 has been 5.7 percent. But still, most of its 15.6 percent gain
for the year came by May.
</P>
<P>
   In the same period, the Nasdaq index is up 50 percent, led by
Qualcom, Oracle, Sun Microsystems, Yahoo and Cisco Systems. For the
year, the index is up 71.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Looked at another way, almost 58 percent of the 500 stocks in
the S&AMP;P 500 index are down 20 percent or more from their 52-week
highs, according to Salomon Smith Barney. Sixty-six percent of the
stocks on the New York Stock Exchange are down 20 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   And this may indicate that the sharp rise in interest rates this
year, which has pushed the yield on the 30-year bond up almost one
and a half percentage points to as high as 6.39 percent, is having
some impact. In this higher rate environment investors are favoring
big-name growth companies and the tech and Internet stocks that
have done so well all year.
</P>
<P>
   In late trading in the bond market Friday, the yield on the
30-year bond slipped a little to 6.37 percent from 6.39 percent on
Thursday. The price, which moves in the opposite direction, rose
5/32, to 96 22/32.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of GE, which also announced a dividend increase, rose 4
1/2, to 151 7/8.
</P>
<P>
   Investors expressed little enthusiasm Friday for a possible
merger between drug giants Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn and Monsanto. Reports
surfaced that the two companies were discussing a deal, but that
was not enough to spark a rally in either stock. Shares of Monsanto
increased a meager 3.4 percent, or $1.375, to close at $41.75.
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn's stock tumbled 6.3 percent, or $3, to close at
$50.25.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judging by what happened Friday, Monsanto is not likely to go
at a premium,'' said Tom Brakel, an analyst with Mehta Partners.
``And if they do this deal, Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn still has to figure
out what to do with Monsanto's agricultural division.''

TIMES CO. TO REDUCE WORK FORCE IN WORCESTER BY 30 JOBS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Employees of the Worcester Telegram &AMP; Gazette learned Friday
that The New York Times Co. plans to reduce the T&AMP;G's work &UR;  &LR; force
by 30 jobs through a voluntary separation program that will get
under way when it takes control of the paper next month.
</P>
<P>
   The Worcester, Mass. paper employs about 500 people.
</P>
<P>
   The Times Co., which also owns The Boston Globe, announced in
October its plan to buy the T&AMP;G for $295 million from Chronicle
Publishing Co. of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   When the sale is completed, expected in early January, T&AMP;G
publisher Bruce Bennett will report to Globe publisher Richard H.
Gilman, in Gilman's role as a member of the senior management team
of The Times Co.
</P>
<P>
   When the T&AMP;G deal was announced, the Times Co. said the Globe
and the T&AMP;G would pursue a ``clustering strategy.'' Because the two
papers publish in neighboring markets, there is a potential for
gaining efficiencies by collaborating on some operations and by
offering national advertisers one-stop shopping for reaching a
large audience of readers in eastern Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Times Co.'s announcement in October, this
clustering strategy can yield results without affecting either the
Globe's or the T&AMP;G's individual identities or structures.
</P>
<P>
   A review of the T&AMP;G's operations convinced the Times Co. that
the T&AMP;G can maintain its quality with a smaller staff, Gilman wrote
in a memo; the decision to cut 30 jobs at the T&AMP;G ``is being taken
to streamline operations, increase efficiencies, and eliminate
positions that are considered redundant.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Pope, a leader in the Worcester unit of the Providence
Newspaper Guild, said most T&AMP;G staffers were still studying the the
voluntary separation offer put forward by the Times Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're mulling it over,'' Pope said. ``It's murky enough and
not specific enough for most people.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks, the T&AMP;G staff mobilized to cover a fire
that killed six Worcester firefighters, and the timing of Friday's
announcement, coming just before Christmas and just after the fire,
angered some in the newsroom, said chairwoman Kathleen A. Shaw of
the T&AMP;G's unit of the newspaper guild.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people feel let down and disheartened,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   T&AMP;G staffers who resign under the voluntary separation program
may qualify for ``extra considerations,'' said Peter Horstmann, the
T&AMP;G's director of human resources, who declined to use the word
``buyout'' to describe the Times Co. offer.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman expressed the hope Friday that 30 job cuts could be
achieved through T&AMP;G staffers opting to take the voluntary
separation package. ``Involuntary reductions'' would come ``only as
a last resort,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman said that there are no plans to take similar action at
the Globe.

   SPERLING, Manitoba _ A century ago, European farmers spilled
across Canada's western prairies, creating ``little Europes.'' As
recently as the 1950s, this farming village outside Winnipeg could
have been in Germany, supporting one restaurant, two churches,
three stores and a high school.
</P>
<P>
   But free market policies _ slashing farm subsidies, allowing
inefficient farmers to fail, and promoting productive techniques
for the survivors, have radically transformed the human landscape
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty five years ago, there were 25 families on this land _
now there is only one,'' said Ron Hiebert, a 49-year-old wheat
farmer, driving over the 8,900 acres he farms with his family.
Sperling's population has dropped in half since 1970, to 100
people, he said, and ``all we have now is the post office and the
rink.''
</P>
<P>
   At the turn of the century, this is precisely the rural
depopulation feared by old world agricultural Europe. It has seen
the farming revolutions wrought in the ``overseas Europes'' _
Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada and the United States _ and
wants nothing to do with them. Its resistance to any change in
European farming, in fact, is a major reason why the World Trade
Organization ministerial meeting in Seattle collapsed early this
month.
</P>
<P>
   To justify their $130 billion in annual farm subsidies, European
Union officials divert discussion from costs to consumers and
taxpayers to talk of keeping people on the land, and of preserving
traditional rural landscapes for tourists.
</P>
<P>
   It is a little late for Canada, which has slashed annual farm
subsidies to about $3 billion today. With farming now employing
only 3 percent of Canada's work force, farmers worry that they have
lost the population and political clout to fight for their
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Following free-trade recipes from earlier international trade
meetings, Canada has cut wheat subsidies from 31 percent of gross
receipts in 1991 to 9 percent today, according to the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development. At the same time, the two
other major wheat producers kept subsidies high _ 38 percent in the
United States and 56 percent in the European Union. Australia's
wheat subsidy is 4 percent. New Zealand has none.
</P>
<P>
   Today, skepticism prevails in Canada's breadbasket when people
hear that Ottawa vows to make cuts in overseas farm subsidies its
priority _ when and if the WTO can convene new trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took the Captain Canuck, Dudley-do-Right attitude that
trade agreements would be followed,'' said John V. Morriss, editor
of the Manitoba Co-operator, a farm weekly. Even if new trade talks
happen, he said, ``Nobody outside of Ottawa thinks this is going to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Canadian Wheat Board, a government agency based in
Winnipeg, Gordon Miles, the executive vice president said: ``Canada
stepped up and eliminated their wheat subsidy. The Europeans
didn't. The Americans didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   ((In an interview published Friday in The Globe and Mail, the
European Union's Trade Commissioner, Pascal Lamy, reiterated the
group's opposition to efforts by Canada to seek lower European farm
subsidies.))
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Canada is revered, even feared, as a lean and mean
agricultural powerhouse. Planting 90 million acres a year, farmers
harvest a cornucopia of crops, including an annual average of 25
million tons of wheat. The world's second-largest wheat exporter,
after the United States, Canada controls about 20 percent of the
world market. In durum wheat, essential for pasta, it controls
almost two-thirds of the internationally traded supply.
</P>
<P>
   But inside the powerhouse, Canadian farmers feel besieged.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists in Canadian cities write dismissively of ``farm
crisis fatigue,'' and openly suggest that some of western Canada's
farm land should be returned to wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Blaming American and European subsidies for disastrously low
wheat prices, the premiers of two prairie provinces, Manitoba and
Saskatchewan, went to Ottawa in late October to seek aid, or what
they called ``trade equalization payments.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Agriculture Minister Lyle Vanclief promised $115
million _ one eighth of what they had sought. The minister, a
member of the Liberal Party, a party with little western rural
support, essentially told the premiers that Canada has too many
farmers. He described his policy as ``tough love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should farmers be rescued to any greater degree than
miners or foresters, all of whom were affected by the slump in
commodity markets?'' The Globe and Mail newspaper editorialized of
the austere position of the minister, who himself failed last year
as an Ontario fruit and vegetable farmer. ``Farmers have cried
crisis frequently enough over the years to trigger a wolf whistle
when they come to Ottawa.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, John Cooper, an Alberta farmer, wrote in The
National Post, Canada's other national newspaper: ``I feel I am
under the heel of the enemy. That is how I view Ottawa, and maybe
all urban people.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the minister told farmers to sink or swim, 5 percent
of prairie farmers interviewed in August by Angus Reid, a polling
group, said they planned to abandon farming. Forty-one percent said
they were ``considering'' leaving farming.

SPERLING, Manitoba:  leaving farming 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last summer, as wheat prices fell to the lowest levels in a
decade, prairie farmers blocked highways, drove in tractorcades to
Ottawa, and talked of blocking food shipments to eastern cities.
One farmer, speaking at a rally in front of Saskatchewan's
legislative assembly, brandished a handful of iron spikes and said,
``If the family farm is not supported, the railways are coming out
too.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Canada's plains, where agriculture has dominated the
economy, farmers were shocked when some impatient drivers responded
to street blockades with obscene hand signals.
</P>
<P>
   In Manitoba, the hardest hit state, farm income is forecast to
plummet this year to $33 million _ only 14 percent of the annual
average of the last five years. In contrast, the province's
manufactured exports have tripled during the 1990s, surpassing
agricultural exports last year for the first time. In 1998, this
province of 1.1 million people exported $677 million worth of oil
seeds and cereal grains, compared to $900 million worth of buses
and aircraft parts.
</P>
<P>
   In a demographic shift that spells a loss of rural access to
government tax money and political influence, the majority of
western Canadians now live in cities. Of the nation's 217,000
farming families, only a minority make the majority of their income
from farming.
</P>
<P>
   With dwindling influence, the farmers see little prospect that
Ottawa will challenge the United States' $47 billion a year farm
subsidies, partly because American demand for Canadian products is
vital to Canada's economic well-being.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 10 months of this year, Canada's trade surplus with
the United States hit $31.5 billion, two-thirds higher than for the
corresponding period a year earlier. Canada runs a trade deficit
with all its other major trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some farmers are turning Ottawa's free market guns on
itself, demanding abolition of the Canadian Wheat Board, a
government monopoly purchasing system that started as a war measure
in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   Dedicated to ``orderly marketing,'' this state company buys all
the wheat and barley grown for export in Western Canada, sells it
overseas, and pays farmers the average, or ``pool'' price. Miles,
the board official, said in Winnipeg, ``Because of the strength of
the monopoly, we can extract better prices.''
</P>
<P>
   But across the street, at the Western Canadian Wheat Growers'
headquarters, officials point to independent surveys that indicate
Canadian wheat farmers get as little as 80 percent of the prices
charged by their American farming neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our farmer knows darn well that he is getting a lower price
than the farmer across the border,'' said Paul D. Earl, policy
manager for the group of 6,000 big western Canada farmers. ``The
position of our organization is that the Canadian Wheat Board
should be a voluntary organization. Farmers should not be forced to
join.''
</P>
<P>
   In September, Elwin Hermanson, Saskatchewan's conservative
candidate for premier, swept rural districts in part by criticizing
the Wheat Board's monopoly. But even in Saskatchewan, the province
with the highest proportion of rural residents, Roy Romanow was
re-elected premier on the strength of city votes.
</P>
<P>
   Some farmers charge that the monopoly has retarded development
of western flour and pasta mills, processing operations that add
value in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Voting with their seeds, many farmers have switched to canola, a
crop that is marketed privately, outside the board's control. Last
year for the first time, canola, which is crushed for edible oil,
overtook wheat to become Canada's most important source of farm
income.
</P>
<P>
   But to preserve soils, farmers must regularly rotate their crops
and plant wheat, generally about every three years. At his
farmhouse here, Hiebert regularly checks his desktop commodities
monitor, looking for the best moment to sell his oats, lentils or
flax to any of a dozen private companies.
</P>
<P>
   But, although he is only a 45-minute drive from the North Dakota
border, he knows the penalties for trying to drive a truckload of
his own wheat out of Canada. Referring to Canadian customs
officials, he said, ``They would throw me in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   During the last upward spike in wheat prices, in the mid-1990s,
about half a dozen western Canadian farmers went to jail for trying
to export their own wheat.
</P>
<P>
   The proof of the state monopoly's inefficiency, says Jim
Pallister, a farmer opponent, is that American farmers rarely try
to send their wheat north to take advantage of Canadian prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see people in Florida trying to take a rowboat to
Havana,'' added Pallister, a Manitoban.

MCCAIN GETS ALONG JUST FINE WITH YOUNG, LIBERAL HARVARD CROWD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When presidential hopeful John McCain appeared Friday
at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, he might have expected
to encounter a crowd made up mostly of skeptical, young liberals.
</P>
<P>
   Young and liberal they may most have been. But skeptical?
Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   The students laughed at his jokes, seemed pleased by his open
invitation to join him on his campaign bus, and tossed him
softballs during the question and answer period. Some of the
students prefaced their queries with remarks about how honored they
were to have him at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   The only inkling of disapproval came after McCain's comments on
the controversy surrounding Vice President Al Gore's 1996 visit to
a California Buddhist temple, at which he raised $140,000 in
political contributions.
</P>
<P>
   McCain poked fun at Gore for saying he wasn't sure where he was
at the time, saying the ``saffron robes'' should have tipped the
vice president off. While that quip has amused other crowds, it
drew some hisses Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before, McCain had told the audience he had vowed to
steer clear of negative campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will never hear me say anything negative about another
political candidate,'' McCain said. ``Americans are tired of that
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain took another poke at Gore, after a student questioned him
about whether he would cut federal funding for research and
development programs at universities. He said he would not.
</P>
<P>
   ``And as we all know,'' he added, ``it was a research and
development project that helped the vice president invent the
Internet. You know, I'm a little older _ I invented television.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain would not be drawn into criticizing his Republican
rival for the nomination, Texas Governor George W. Bush, whom he
called ``a fine and decent man.'' He refused to comment when asked
about rumors that his rival had once used drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe George Bush deserves privacy,'' McCain said. ``Part
of this gets back to motivating people to serve and run in
politics. I'm one of the most flawed people you will ever encounter
in public life and I think that it's important that we allow some
privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain took every opportunity Friday to reiterate his goal of
doing away with soft money in political campaigns, the subject of a
joint appearance Thursday with Democratic presidential candidate
Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I achieve this goal?'' McCain said. ``I'm not sure, we're
still the underdog. Every time I see the amount of money Governor
Bush has, I'm reminded of the words of Chairman Mao, who said,
`It's always darkest before it's completely black.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the students asked foreign policy questions, which
campaign aides have said McCain relishes.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what his policy would be on deploying US troops in the
Golan Heights to ensure peace between Israel and Syria, McCain said
he could not give specifics until a viable peace agreement was in
place. But he said he thought American voters would support US aid
to the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real key to peace in the Middle East is to bring elected
governments and democratic societies,'' McCain said. Terrorism
thrives in undemocratic countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Chechnya, McCain said that the Clinton administration had not
acted decisively enough, and that the re-emergence of the Russian
military, and what he saw as attempts to reinstate ``the old Soviet
Union,'' posed long-term threats to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would cut off trade loans to Russia, and keep the
Chechens' plight on television screens so that Americans become
more concerned about it. ``If I were president of United States, I
would be talking about it every day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the situation in Haiti, McCain said he would not
have committed 20,000 troops and several billion dollars to
reinstate former president Jean-Bertrand Aristide, referring to
President Clinton's five-year commitment to the island, which
formally ends Jan. 1. Though Aristide has been reinstalled, the
island is still gripped by poverty and political chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Haiti is worse-off for the experience,'' McCain said.
He said he favors humanitarian aid instead.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also reaffirmed his support for the ``don't ask, don't
tell'' policy on gays and lesbians in the military. The policy,
McCain said, was good enough for him because someone he admired
greatly had taken a role in designing it: ``General Colin Powell _
who, by the way, would be secretary of state in a McCain
administration.''

SIGNS OF BETTER HEALTH FOR DRUGSTORE STOCKS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 19) 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Graphic of Standard &AMP; Poor's Drugstores Retail Index is
being sent to NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make
individual purchase by calling (888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   One weakened stock can drag down an entire sector. And that may
present opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The recent performance of drugstore stocks is an example. This
year, the Standard &AMP; Poor's Drugstores Retail Index has fallen 30.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The primary cause has been the Rite Aid Corp., the Camp Hill,
Pa.-based chain whose stock dropped from $51.125 a share on Jan. 8
to $4.50 on Nov. 11, as a string of accounting problems came to
light.
</P>
<P>
   Twice this year, the company has restated earnings reports. And
on Oct. 18, Rite Aid's bank creditors forced out Martin Grass, then
the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, investors have been selling other drugstore
stocks, worrying that Rite Aid's accounting practices may be
pervasive in the industry. Analysts contend that its problems were
isolated.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 6, when Rite Aid announced that it had hired a new
senior management team, some investors rejoiced: Rite Aid's stock
rose 39 percent in one day. On Friday, Rite Aid closed at $13.
</P>
<P>
   But which drugstore stocks stand to benefit, now that some
analysts say that the cloud over Rite Aid has begun to lift?
``Investors saw Rite Aid burst into flames, but the only thing
investors have to fear here is fear,'' said Mark Husson, an analyst
at Merrill Lynch. ``The biggest problem here is re-establishing
upward momentum in investors' minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, industry sales have been healthy. The Walgreen Co.
reported a 14.8 percent sales increase for November at stores open
at least a year; at the CVS Corp., the gain was 11 percent for the
four weeks ended Nov. 20. Those chains, along with Rite Aid, have
been opening stores at a furious pace in the last few years,
competing for the title of America's largest drugstore chain. (CVS
leads in number of stores; Walgreen is first in sales.)
</P>
<P>
   Drug retailers are also benefiting from demographic trends. The
aging of the baby boomers is bolstering sales, as is the rising
number of so-called lifestyle drugs like Xenical, for weight loss.
And a rising number of Americans, now about 75 percent, receive
prescription drug benefits, further increasing demand.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say the chief beneficiary of the rebound will be
CVS, whose shares now trade at $31.8125, or 18 times estimated
earnings for 2000. By contrast, Walgreen, now at $28.50, is trading
at 39 times estimated 2000 earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that while some difference between the two
companies' multiples is warranted _ given Walgreen's strong
management and record of earnings growth _ it should not be so
wide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gap now is crazy,'' said Meredith Adler, an analyst at
Lehman Brothers, who says the difference, now 21, should be closer
to 5. She has a strong buy recommendation on CVS, with a 52-week
price target of $61 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Adler has a buy recommendation on Walgreen, but with a
52-week target of $34, just 19 percent above its current level,
because the stock has already climbed so far in the last few years.
Ms. Adler is also one of the few analysts to recommend Rite Aid,
largely because she thinks that most of the bad news is behind it.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook is also improving for at least one regional chain _
Duane Reade, which has stores in the New York metropolitan area and
is now trading at $20.4375, just above its 52-week low. ``There's a
chance that someone is going to buy them out,'' said Archana Basi,
an analyst for T. Rowe Price Associates, which owned 8.6 percent of
the company as of Sept. 30. ``If not, they're a great company in a
unique market.''

INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS CONDEMN RUSSIA'S ACTIONS IN CHECHNYA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ The world's biggest industrial countries, meeting with
Russia in the Group of 8, on Friday issued another condemnation of
Moscow's actions in Chechnya and called for an immediate cease-fire
there.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warned that Russia was
becoming increasingly isolated in the international community,
threatening its larger relationships.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright also stressed the importance of relations with
Russia for the United States, and none of the foreign ministers
even suggested suspending Russia from the group, to which it had
originally been invited by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was there any serious discussion about imposing economic or
other sanctions on Moscow, which gave no indication of changing its
policy or fierce tactics toward the Chechens two days before
parliamentary elections in Russia on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   As Russian forces continued to bomb Grozny, the Chechen capital,
and to prevent an estimated 45,000 civilians trapped there from
seeking safety, the Russian Foreign Minister, Igor Ivanov,
responded soothingly to the Western criticism, saying, ``On some
issues our opinions coincide, on others they diverge, but what's
important is that this issue should not lead to us growing apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov insisted that ``I never felt isolated from my colleagues
in the Group of 8,'' causing Albright to respond that Ivanov
himself was treated with respect but that Russia's behavior in
Chechnya ``creates problems in the ways it deals with its
partners.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I think has been evident at this meeting, frankly, is
that the Russians, through their actions, are self-isolating from
the rest of the international community,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   European and U.S. officials said the host Germans, including
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, were particularly concerned that
the meeting not concentrate on criticism of Russia, so there would
be no important breach with Moscow, but focus instead on the theme
of preventive diplomacy to stop future wars, a key issue for
Fischer's Green Party.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that the French were particularly outspoken
in the meetings about the need to take action to show Moscow that
its partners were serious about their criticism, and that the
British, too, were taking a harder line.
</P>
<P>
   But even the harder-line European idea of ``no sanctions but no
aid'' to Moscow creates problems for Washington, senior U.S.
officials said, since cutting or even suspending aid to Moscow
would be a sanction. In any event, most U.S. aid is directed to
Russian civilians, regions and nongovernmental organizations, not
to the central government, unlike most European foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   Officials acknowledged that the timing of this meeting, so close
to the Russian elections, was awkward, and left Moscow little room
to compromise. The battle against the Chechens has been very
popular among ordinary Russians, and some Western governments fear
that strong Western action now would only backfire and help
anti-Western politicians and parties, like the Communists of
Gennadi A. Zyuganov. Moscow in the meantime seems to be trying to
conquer Grozny by Sunday, a senior U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow responded to similar criticism by NATO foreign ministers
in Brussels earlier this week by complaining of interference in
internal affairs and raising the example of NATO's bombing of
Yugoslavia in the Kosovo conflict this year. ``Another splash of
crocodile tears in Brussels about `human rights' simply amazes us
by its cynicism,'' Ivanov's Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Ivanov kept his cool. ``We are not talking of criticism of
one party by another,'' he said. ``The situation is complicated,
and there are no simple solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ivanov did not want to appear at a joint news conference
with the other foreign ministers, to avoid sitting through public
criticism. Instead, each foreign minister had separate news
conferences or briefings, while Fischer read a ``chairman's
statement'' _ since member Russia would not agree to a joint
statement _ calling for an immediate cease-fire and serious
political negotiations with responsible Chechen leaders to end the
war, as Moscow has already promised but done little to bring about.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fight against terrorists cannot be won by indiscriminate
war against cities and the whole population,'' said the statement,
approved by the seven other members. ``The war poses a serious
threat to partnership and cooperation between Russia and all of
us.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But having allowed the chairman of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe, Knut Vollebaek, to visit the region,
Moscow is now expected to allow a few monitors from the security
organization to watch the borders with Chechnya and Georgia _ ``a
sop,'' a senior European official acknowledged, ``to their need and
our need to show that something happened here.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright also met here with leaders of the democratic opposition
to President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, on a day when a key
Serbian opposition coalition finally called a halt to its dwindling
and now farcical daily rallies against Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, with European Union representatives, is intended to
boost the opposition, and Washington is increasing its aid _ from
$12 million to $25 million _ to independent media, the opposition
and nongovernmental organizations. But Albright rejected the
opposition's united call for the lifting of sanctions against
Belgrade and its government, including bans on regular oil
importation and flights to Belgrade.

DEEP SECRET: ENVIRONMENT OF NEWLY OPENED CAVERNS ZEALOUSLY GUARDED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BENSON, Ariz. _ The park ranger at the front of our pack beckons
us to step, single-file, inside the long, narrow vault; the ranger
at the back closes a heavy steel door. It slams tightly shut,
vacuum-packing the 20 of us inside. Slowly, we feel the humidity
hit, like a miniature cloud seeping over our bodies, rising inch by
inch from the ground up. The air is warmer and clammier than the
desert air outside. It smells like a swim team's locker room.
</P>
<P>
   We are preparing to go where few _ relatively speaking _ have
gone before: Kartchner Caverns State Park, the most prominent U.S.
cave to open in a generation. Our mid-November tour is taking place
just a week after the cave officially began accepting paying
tourists Nov. 12. Even counting the park officials, construction
workers and media members who've already been here, the number of
previous visitors is only in the low thousands.
</P>
<P>
   And especially compared with other public caves, often used as
homes or hideouts by American Indians or early settlers or even
outlaws before being opened to masses of camera-wielding tourists,
this is truly virgin territory. Located an hour's drive southeast
of Tucson, Kartchner Caverns apparently was untouched by humans
until it was discovered by two amateur cavers in 1974; it was seen
by only a handful of carefully chosen people for a decade after
that. The adventurers who found the caverns kept them a closely
guarded secret until they were sure the rare formations inside
could be preserved.
</P>
<P>
   That's because, unlike many caves, Kartchner Caverns is still
``alive.'' Left undisturbed, the colorful and fragile formations
that have developed over millions of years beneath the Arizona
desert will continue to grow. Mishandled, the formations could stop
growing or even be broken off, and the complicated ecosystem of
minuscule cave dwellers could be irrevocably altered.
</P>
<P>
   That's why access to the cave has been so strictly controlled;
visitors who touch a formation won't just be thrown out, they could
be subject to criminal prosecution. And it's why the development of
the cave, from first human footfall to first official tourist, took
more than 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, it seems absurd that they were able to keep it
secret for so long.
</P>
<P>
   Recipient of much admiring press coverage (a multiday report on
National Public Radio, a cover story in USA Today, among others),
the cave is already being termed a huge success. More than 50,000
tour reservations have been booked, and reservations are largely
sold out into March.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that is due to its geological importance; experts have
called Kartchner Caverns one of the 10 most important caves in the
world in terms of mineral deposits, and it is the only one in the
United States open to visitors. The limestone cave's three major
rooms, each bigger than a football field, contain large versions of
common formations such as columns, stalagmites and stalactites, and
more unusual developments such as ``bacon,'' ``turnip welts,''
``fried eggs,'' ``cave popcorn,'' and ``cave pearls'' _ all of
which look exactly like their names.
</P>
<P>
   And part is due to the irresistible back story, already taking
on a mythological bent. Randy Tufts and Gary Tenen were in their
early 20s when they burrowed into a sinkhole and emerged, after
much muddy crawling, into a vast underground wonderland. Struck by
the beauty, size and rarity of the formations, and sure they'd
stumbled onto a once-in-a-lifetime find, they named it Xanadu and
began covert explorations.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that the cave might be vandalized, and thus ruined, by
other explorers, they kept the secret for two years before finally
informing the Kartchner family, who owned the property over the
cave. The family also recognized the importance of the find, and
they agreed to keep the secret until it could be determined how
best to preserve it. So protective were the caves' defenders that
they blindfolded the first few government officials to tour the
cave so that they couldn't find it on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in 1988, the Arizona State Parks Board acquired the
cave and began the process of developing it for tourists. Board
members had the benefits of learning from the mistakes made at
caves discovered much earlier, but it was still a slow and
difficult process.
</P>
<P>
   The interior of the cave hovers at 68 degrees year-round, with
99 percent humidity _ a stark contrast to the dry, hot desert
outside. It is precisely those conditions that allowed the
formations to develop and that had to be maintained.
</P>
<P>
   The cave's designers came up with a series of compression
chambers, misters and monitoring stations to keep the cave as
pristine as possible. Then, keeping as much as possible to the
paths made by the original explorers, trails were built by hand
without the use of heavy equipment, often with the help of
volunteers carrying out buckets of rock one or two at a time.
Sometimes only inches of progress were made in a day.
</P>
<P>
   Modifications were added as they went along; for instance, the
cave's walkways are washed each night, to rid them of stray
clothing fibers or hair unwittingly deposited by visitors. Misters
run intermittently , to compensate for the moisture carried out on
guests' clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Construction went more slowly and cost more money than
anticipated; $28 million has been spent so far, and they're not
finished. The opening was postponed from November 1997, mostly
because tunnel construction took about 16 months longer than
anticipated, but finally, tours began this November.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   MORE
nn
</P>
<P>
   What has been built is not the typical herd-'em-in tourist
attraction that so many U.S. caves have become.
</P>
<P>
   Reservations are strongly recommended; on my visit, several
groups without them were turned away. Visitors are urged to arrive
at least an hour before their scheduled hour-long tour, in order to
examine the exhibits on cave formations at the visitor's center and
watch a short video on the cave's development.
</P>
<P>
   Tour groups, which are limited to 20 members _ 16 reserved and
four walk-ups _ are driven to the cave's entrance in electric
trams. Rules are strictly enforced: no flash photos, no
videotaping, no gum, no littering, no strollers or backpacks. Each
tour is led by two park rangers, one of whom stays in front and the
other who brings up the rear, and they keep a close eye on
tourists. Kind of like a Nature's Secret Service, they magically
rearrange themselves to contain visitors so that nobody has a
chance to surreptitiously finger a stalactite. (They are serious
about this. A temporary worker who intentionally broke off a piece
of crystal during construction was fired, then charged with a
misdemeanor; he was fined the cost of the repair and given two
years' probation.)
</P>
<P>
   The mood on my tour is more school field trip than vacation
outing; even though rangers John Hawkins and Peter Polley are
pleasant and chatty, they take their jobs seriously. When we arrive
at the cave's entrance, guarded by a volunteer, we slowly file into
the first of two airlocked compartments.
</P>
<P>
   After several firm warnings to touch nothing, even by accident,
Hawkins opens another steel door and we enter a second compression
chamber, filled with air that's even more humid than that of the
first. Finally, a third steel door is opened, and we step into the
actual cave.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the caverns' three major rooms are now open. Though the
scientific importance of the cave's deposits may be lost on the
average visitor, the visuals are impressive. It's hard to believe
it's all just rocks. The butterscotch drapery looks like beeswax;
pieces of the wall shimmer like they were sprinkled with diamond
chips; the impossibly skinny ``soda straw'' formations are so
fragile they look like they'd break if you brushed against them.
</P>
<P>
   The first room on the tour is called the Rotunda Room; its most
memorable feature is the mud flats, where what looks like a deep
sea of mud is topped with an expansive ceiling of stalactites
reaching almost to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Next, we're led into the larger, more dramatic Throne Room. This
is home to the cave's largest formation, the grandiose Kubla Khan.
A massive 58-foot-tall rock column, it looks like a forced-together
melange of frozen drips and molten, oozing mud, kind of like a
backdrop from a Sid and Marty Kroft Saturday-morning show.
</P>
<P>
   The tour ends with a meditative light-and-music show at Kubla
Khan, which we watch sitting on concrete benches built on a rock
outcropping where the two young explorers used to sit and
contemplate their find. If the show is a little New Age meets Las
Vegas, it's still beautiful to watch the lights flicker against the
shimmering rocks and awe-inspiring to consider what it must have
felt like to be the first humans to come across this.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows for sure what the long-term effects will be, on
either the cave or the surrounding area.
</P>
<P>
   The closest town, Benson, has been bracing itself for a tourism
bonanza, but its offerings remain fairly basic and unsophisticated:
chain motels, fast-food outlets, a few family-owned restaurants and
souvenir shops. Many visitors will probably stay instead an hour's
drive away in Tucson, with its superior lodging, restaurants and
cultural attractions, but tourism officials expect that more
upscale dining and lodging, such as small bed-and-breakfasts, will
sprout near the cave.
</P>
<P>
   As for the cave, it will continue to develop as well. Excavation
and construction continues on a third area, the aptly named Big
Room, which is nearly double the size of the Throne Room. The Big
Room is expected to open for tours within a few years, though an
exact date has not been set. The remaining large feature, the
250-foot-long Subway Tunnel that links the Throne and Rotunda rooms
with the Big Room, will probably never open to the public because
it is too narrow and muddy and unsuited to a large number of
visitors. In addition, too much human contact could easily damage
it environmentally.
</P>
<P>
   That, in fact, is the overriding unanswered question about the
whole underground system. Park officials have begun a 10-year study
of the effects of tourism, based on an estimated 200,000 visitors
per year. What they do with the cave _ open it to more visitors,
limit it to fewer, or, more remotely, shut it down completely _
hinges on that.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's something to chew on: For almost all of this year, the
yield on the Russell 2000 index of small stocks, now 1.43 percent,
has been higher than that for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index of
mostly large-cap stocks, currently 1.19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P 500, of course, isn't what it used to be _ since 1988,
nearly 300 of its components have changed. Still, these are most of
the country's biggest, most established companies, many of which
pay dividends. Small companies often aren't expected to pay
dividends; they are expected to grow, and faster than their larger
cousins.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, that hasn't been happening either, and investors
have long since gotten the message. Unless something miraculous
happens in the next two weeks, 1999 will be the sixth consecutive
year that the Russell 2000 has underperformed the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the worm is finally about to turn. John H. Laporte, lead
portfolio manager of T. Rowe Price New Horizons _ one of the
nation's oldest small-cap funds _ certainly hopes so. Last week, he
took some time to talk about the sector's prospects. Here are
excerpts from the conversation: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What will it take to get small-cap stocks moving? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. To me, the really critical factor is an improvement in
relative earnings growth. Historically, the sweet spot of the
economic cycle has been when small companies do exceedingly well.
That has not happened this time around, and I don't know why it
hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   If small companies can deliver the earnings, investors are going
to buy them. And I see no fundamental reason why small companies
will be permanently disadvantaged in terms of earnings growth. It
doesn't make sense that in the aggregate, small companies will grow
their earnings several percentage points below big companies.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last five or six years, the market cycle has challenged
the long-held tenet that small caps outperform over the long term.
But what you need to keep in mind is that small caps have
historically traded in long cycles of five to seven years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Some argue that large companies have adopted many of the
mannerisms of small ones, enhancing their ability to outperform.
Does that train of thought have merit? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There is some validity to some of those arguments. One of the
reasons large companies are doing better is that they got religion
in the 1990s, and it became voguish to cut costs. Since large
companies had more fat to be cut, that has helped large companies
in general.
</P>
<P>
   Small companies have also suffered because the cost of capital
has done nothing but get more expensive relative to large caps. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. And yet there is a story within the story this year. Haven't
small technology stocks done much better than the average small-cap
stock? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Even in the small-cap world, technology stocks in general
have done very, very well. There are some small-cap growth funds
that have more than 50 percent of their money invested in
technology and the Internet and are up over 100 percent this year.
We are more diversified than that and have done OK _ through Dec.
14, we were up just over 17 percent. But it really depends what
your benchmark is. My average technology stock is up 50 percent to
75 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   The other area that has done well is biotechnology. Outside of
those two areas, everything else has shown only a nominal gain. You
could make a case that small-cap tech stocks are cheaper than
large-cap tech stocks. You can also say they are expensive, really
expensive, relative to other small-cap stocks. A year ago, I could
have generalized by saying that all small-cap stocks were cheap. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you see this mania for technology and Internet stocks
continuing? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Over the next few months the trend will continue. But I don't
expect it to go on indefinitely, because the valuation disparity is
so wide. You are seeing a record number of smaller companies being
bought out by bigger ones this year, in part because large caps see
value there. I think there is a floor being created where the
corporate world is going to step in and say, ``Hey, this is
ridiculous; I can buy cheaper than I can make.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Would you care to share some names of stocks that look
compelling right now? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Omnicare, an institutional pharmacy provider, is one. They
have a great growth record, but have suffered this year because of
problems in the nursing home industry. The stock has been
slaughtered. At the moment, it is selling at about 10 times what I
think it will earn next year.
</P>
<P>
   In technology, the stock I like is Sipex, an analog
semiconductor company. Their earnings are down sharply this year
due to a problem with an outside supplier. We think they will do
much better next year. The stock is currently selling at less than
20 times earnings. I don't know many technology companies you can
say that about.

   An Adviser to the Stars Moves to a Court Setting &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you missed Dana Giacchetto's first 15 minutes of fame, stay
tuned. This controversial young financial adviser _ his clients
until recently included Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck
and Cameron Diaz _ is fighting a spate of nasty publicity by suing
his estranged business partners.
</P>
<P>
   Time magazine and the Los Angeles Times recently reported that
clients were deserting Giacchetto (pronounced ju-CHET-oh), but
Giacchetto says those reports actually caused the exodus.
</P>
<P>
   His lawsuit accuses a business partner, Jeffrey A. Sachs, of
slandering him by falsely telling many people, including one of
DiCaprio's advisers, that Giacchetto's firm, the Cassandra Group in
New York, was in trouble. Sachs, a New York political and business
consultant, said that ``there has been no defamation and no
untruths.''
</P>
<P>
   In his suit, Giacchetto further contends that Sachs and Samuel
S. Holdsworth, a former magazine publisher, unfairly pushed him out
of a venture capital fund that they organized in November 1998 with
an affiliate of Chase Manhattan Bank. Holdsworth expressed sympathy
``for someone who was once a very great friend, who is now
desperate enough to employ these sorts of tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   A subdued Giacchetto acknowledged that 17 clients _ including
the young stars _ have left his firm, but said he still managed
$141 million for 290 others. ``I understand why clients would not
want their name associated with this bad publicity, but I believe
many will come back,'' he said.

   Two leading financiers are getting deep into gardening without
getting dirt under their presumably well-trimmed fingernails. Lord
Rothschild and Henry Kravis, longtime friends, are paying $1.2
million for 9 percent of a gardening Web site, Crocus.co.uk, a
gardening site yet to go online.
</P>
<P>
   Rothschild acknowledged that he knew little about gardening or
the Internet. ``I can't pretend to be a gardener, but I try,'' he
said, adding that, in using the Internet, ``I have to get help
constantly.'' Rothschild's son, James, _ ``fanatically keen on the
Internet,'' his dad says _ has advised him on investing in this
site and others.

   Some of the most exclusive New Year's Eve celebrations may be in
the Silicon Valley command centers that are set up to monitor
customers' computers. Many top executives plan to be present.
``I'll be sipping champagne with our employees who will be working
in our Palo Alto command center,'' said Carly Fiorina,
Hewlett-Packard's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   While Hewlett-Packard has agreed to let reporters watch, other
companies are being more reserved and less festive. On the other
side of the valley, in Santa Clara, Calif., John Chambers, chief
executive of Cisco Systems, plans to oversee a center that will be
closed to the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it won't be a party atmosphere,'' said a Cisco
spokesman, John Earnhart. ``We have no idea what is going to happen
in Asia and Eastern Europe, but hopefully it will be a very boring
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the valley's generals plan to linger in war rooms.
While Sun Microsystems will be on full alert, Scott McNealy, the
chief executive, might not be. As Elizabeth McNichols, a
spokeswoman, explained, ``I think he'll be at home.''

   Steven Roth's two-year search for a director of development for
his Vornado Realty Trust, the big Manhattan commercial landlord, in
recent weeks included none other than John E. Zuccotti, an eminence
grise of New York real estate. Zuccotti did not appreciate the
call, according to a close friend. No mere hired hand, Zuccotti,
the former deputy mayor, is chairman of Brookfield Financial
Properties, which owns almost as much Manhattan property. ``They
were so naive'' to even think they could hire him, this person
said.
</P>
<P>
   At least two other candidates have rebuffed overtures. And
Bernard Mendik, ostensibly co-chairman of Vornado, left a year ago
rather than continue playing third fiddle to Roth and endure his
barbed wit.
</P>
<P>
   Vornado plans to announce an, er, winner early next year. ``This
is absolutely everybody's dream job as a developer,'' said Jane
Lyons, a partner at Rhodes Associates, hired 82 days ago, she said
on Friday, for the search. ``But you've got to have the
professional weight and experience to sit at the table with
Steve.''

COMMENTARY: THE FUTURE WILL RESUME IN 15 DAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FRANK RICH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the beginning there was sex. Then there was violence. Then
there was apocalypse. And finally there was shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Such has been the narrative _ part Old Testament, part old
Judith Krantz _ of the Internet thus far. As we have tried to
grapple with the daunting growth of a medium unknown to most of us
five years ago, we have successively focused on its capacity for
spreading pornography and sex scandal, for fomenting explosive
political extremism, for compounding the alleged chaos of Y2K, for
creating wealth and for letting us shop till we drop without
getting dressed. We have made folk legends out of young dot-com
zillionaires, national goblins out of online Nazis proselytizing to
the young. We have learned of an alternate universe where people
live by Internet time and are paid in Internet money. We cannot
venture anywhere in the ``real'' world without consuming ads for
Web sites we've never heard of that want to take us to virtual
destinations unknown.
</P>
<P>
   But in truth we ain't seen nothin' yet, and much of our national
conversation to date about the Internet, especially that to be
found in the mainstream media-political culture, is not remotely
keeping up with the pace of change.
</P>
<P>
   At this moment, only somewhere between a third and a half of
America is online, and much of that on slow phone connections.
Nonetheless, we already send three times as much e-mail as we do
regular mail. Internet traffic is doubling every 95 days. Americans
alone are adding 2 million pages to the Web daily. What will happen
in the not-that-distant future when broadband _ that is to say,
fast _ connections are ubiquitous rather than a luxury for a tiny
minority? What happens once the Internet is always on, seamlessly
built into our lives at home and at work, and all other media, from
high-quality video to new forms yet to be seen, are instantly
accessible through it? We're only at the beginning of this
transformation _ the top half of the first inning, as one of the
many metaphors applied to the Internet would have it.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on whom you listen to, what is still to come, even as
the gold rush continues, is analogous to the advent of movable
type, the Industrial Revolution, the arrival of electricity or the
phone, the building of the transcontinental railroad, the creation
of metal currency or the invention of the Arabic zero. But Zoe
Baird, who now runs the Markle Foundation, which is dedicated to
raising and studying policy questions prompted by the Internet's
future, points out that even these historical metaphors may not do
justice to the digital universe that awaits us. Technological leaps
of the past may not have had so ``pervasive (an) influence in all
spheres of public and private life,'' she says. The Internet's
capacity to have a ``global impact in transforming culture and
politics and social interaction can create a world we've never seen
before in its thrilling potential, or create tremendous
instability.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even at this early point, the flashier changes making headlines
just in the past few weeks are random and dizzying, whether trivial
or profound. Encyclopedia Britannica was forced by the e-market
environment to give away its costly content free on the Web. Ford
and General Motors, which epitomize old-tech industry, are moving
their huge purchasing operations to the Internet. The University of
Texas library reports that while book circulation is down, that of
e-books is up, and publishers and retail book chains alike are
scrambling to digitize every book possible, so that any title will
be instantly available in any form the customer chooses (paper
included). Prestigious business schools and Wall Street financial
institutions now report a growing brain drain, as young talent
splits to join tech start-ups. In Boston, Hale &AMP; Dorr, the
echt-Yankee law firm, officially ended its jacket-and-tie dress
code last month, lest its techie clientele in T-shirts feel out of
place. (How much longer will TV news shows, already abandoned by
the digital generations, be anchored by guys dressed like '80s
investment bankers?) The annual sales of digital video games now
match Hollywood's annual box office and have sent companies like
Hasbro, still marketing the passe, pre-digital sci-fi of ``Star
Wars'' toys, into free fall.
</P>
<P>
   When E-Bay added some 6 million distinct new users over the past
year and Amazon.com some eight million, that was not just a
shopping phenomenon. ``These are huge communities,'' says Eric
Schmidt, CEO of Novell, a leader in corporate network software.
Unlimited by physical borders, they are not only expanding faster
than any communities in history but their citizens ``cross
cultural, language and income barriers which we've never seen
crossed before.'' Indeed, Steven Johnson, author of ``Interface
Culture,'' says that ``it's no longer possible to talk about one
Web.'' For every wide-open community like E-Bay, there's a
members-only gated community, not to mention the loud parasite
communities that spring up opportunistically. Each has its own
dynamic and tribal rituals.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt, Ms. Baird and Eric Benhamou, the CEO of 3Com (of Palm
Pilot fame), were among the participants this week in a panel on
the ``digital divide'' held by the New America Foundation. Both in
their forum and in conversations I had with them later, they spoke
urgently of issues overlooked amidst our dot-com and Y2K mania. Ms.
Baird points out that poorer communities left unwired, whether
urban or rural, are as likely to wither as the towns that were
bypassed by our interstate highway system. Schmidt and Benhamou are
alarmed by the failure of black and Hispanic Americans to enter
their work force, and by the failure of our schools to deliver the
right training. (Hooking up classrooms to computers, though
proceeding apace, is barely a first step.) The chasm separating the
haves and have-nots of the Net, like all other digital issues, is
global; a minuscule number of Africans are online.
</P>
<P>
   The other digital divide _ generational _ has its own fallout. A
perusal of the major presidential candidates' Web sites suggests
that only Al Gore is trying to move beyond boilerplate in
addressing Net issues. It's not clear if his rivals are much more
technologically literate than Bill Clinton, who last month held a
bogus first presidential Internet chat in which he never touched
the laptop in front of him. So far the campaign's digital policy
conflicts have mainly consisted of either pandering or hedging on
the issue of an Internet sales tax, and of Orrin Hatch's silly
critique of George W. Bush's Web site for not being ``user
friendly.'' All the candidates have user-friendly Web sites _ for
raising money, not for raising the level of digital debate.
</P>
<P>
   To see how the generation gap wreaks havoc in the private
sector, look at any major media corporation, such as Time Warner,
that has thrown away millions on an ill-conceived Web portal;
chances are you'll find hands-on Internet ignorance among the
analog suits at the top (much as the movie moguls of an earlier
generation failed to ``get'' television). As James Fallows writes
in The Industry Standard of the newsman Sam Donaldson's clueless
daily Webcasts, ``This is how it must have been for Ramon Novarro
or Theda Bara, great silent-era stars trying to figure out what had
changed when the talkies arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to understand the Internet,'' says Eric Schmidt,
``rent, buy or borrow a teen-ager. Their view of technology is
radically different from the rest of the culture.'' And there's no
time to waste. Once the infrastructure of the virtual world is more
or less built, once it is the principal place where we live and
work, it will be much harder to address and adjudicate such issues
as equity, privacy, intellectual property rights and education than
it is when its architecture is still in flux.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Benhamou of 3Com believes that when the obsession with Y2K
is history _ Jan. 2 is a mere 15 days from now, whatever happens _
we'll at last start to address the extraordinary questions that are
rushing at us. As no less a futurist than Stan Lee, the wizard of
Marvel comics, declares in Wired, ``If you're interested in
technology and the progress of humankind, this is the most exciting
period ever.'' He's right, but most of us know even less about the
huge social choices raised by software code than those inherent in
biological science's parallel breakthroughs in manipulating genetic
code. Even a year or two after Y2K, a 1999 fixation like ``Will my
e-gifts arrive in time?'' may seem as quaint and distant as the
horse-and-buggy of a century ago.

2 CUBAN INMATES GIVE UP; 6 CONTINUE STANDOFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. MARTINVILLE, La. _ Two of the eight Cuban detainees holding
hostages inside a parish jail here surrendered to the authorities
late Thursday night while a hostage came out at about the same
time, the sheriff said Friday. Though negotiations to end the
five-day standoff continued, there was no indication that it was
drawing to a close.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long, slow process,'' the sheriff, Charles S. Fuselier
of St. Martin Parish, said of negotiations with the six remaining
Cuban inmates who are seeking an end to their indefinite
confinement.
</P>
<P>
   The six inmates continued to hold the warden, Todd Louvierre,
and a deputy, Jolie Sonnier, in the warden's office along with six
female prisoners, Fuselier said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Another deputy, Brandon N. Boudreaux, who had been held since
the uprising began on Monday, came out of the jail late Thursday
and was described as being in good condition. Fuselier would not
comment on reports that Boudreaux had escaped. Three female inmates
also came out at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the jail, 35 Cuban detainees who are not part of the
uprising were still behind bars, along with 26 other inmates, the
sheriff said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Mathews III, a special agent with the FBI who is part of
the negotiating team, said the authorities have regained control of
most of the jail, with the exception of the warden's office where
the hostages and captors were confined. The detainees had been in
control of the jail's command post and the building's electronic
locks, but apparently gave up that room.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans, all of whom were part of the Mariel boatlift in 1980
when 125,000 Cubans arrived in the United States, had finished
serving time for crimes committed in the United States and would
normally be deported if they were citizens of most other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Cuban government has refused to take them back, the
inmates are being held under a 1996 federal law prohibiting the
immigration agency from releasing noncitizens who are considered
threats to society.
</P>
<P>
   The six had been convicted in the United States of various
crimes, including homicide, rape, burglary, robbery and drug sales,
according to records released by the Immigration and Naturalization
Service.
</P>
<P>
   They are among 2,400 Cuban detainees held mostly in small-town
jails around the country, whose continued detention has drawn
protests from human-rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Mike Foster, who visited the jail Friday, said Louisiana
was growing weary of the difficulty in housing Cuban detainees.
Louisiana has nearly 1,000 Cubans in local jails, many of whom had
been in the nearby Oakdale detention facility before they rioted in
1987 and were then dispersed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more of this, the less the people will want to take
them,'' Foster said.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours before the deputy and the two Cubans came out, the
jail's public address system crackled with the voices of the warden
and Ms. Sonnier.
</P>
<P>
   In what appeared to be a prerecorded statement, the warden said
the federal government had misled the public about the nature of
the Cubans' detention, and Ms. Sonnier had asked for a helicopter
to take the prisoners to freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Fuselier and FBI officials would not discuss the statements or
whether they might have been coerced, although the sheriff seemed
to indicate he did not take them seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an opinion of what took place, but I would rather
reserve that,'' the sheriff said.

   A Fraction at a Time &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bull market hasn't trickled down to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that many stocks trade for a couple of hundred
dollars or more a share, so buying a round lot of 100 shares can be
prohibitively expensive for many people. Then there are brokerage
commissions, the costs of putting together a diversified portfolio
of 10 or 12 stocks, and the minimums _ sometimes $20,000 or more _
that discount brokerage firms may require for opening an account.
</P>
<P>
   A new online service, Buyandhold.com of New York City,
drastically lowers the barriers to entry for small-fry investors,
allowing individuals to open accounts for as little as $20 and to
buy fractional shares of stock _ say, one-quarter of a share of
CMGI for about $53.
</P>
<P>
   The fee to buy or sell shares is $2.99 a transaction, regardless
of the dollar amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an opportunity for everybody and everyone to
participate on Wall Street,'' said Peter E. Breen, chief executive
of Buyandhold.com, which began operations last month. ``This is the
feel-good service of Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   A possible downside: The low transaction cost stems from the
fact that buy-and-sell orders are executed just twice a day, once
in the morning and once in the afternoon, when an investor offer to
sell, say, one-fifth of a share of Microsoft stock, for $23.05, is
pooled with like trades of other investors. So investors won't know
in advance the exact prices of stocks they trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are an aggregator of transactions,'' said Breen, 35.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the target audience of Buyandhold.com is participants in
direct purchase plans, sometimes called dividend reinvestment
programs, or DRIPs, that let investors buy shares directly from a
company. Buyandhold.com will simplify such investors' paperwork by
providing them with an online account that shows their average cost
and other data.
</P>
<P>
   As of last week, Buyandhold.com had attracted 3,000 accounts,
Breen said.

<P>
   Active Managers Win Again &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the last quarter of the millennium winds to a close, it looks
as if investors who placed their bets with the active fund managers
have again outperformed those who chose to simply track the
Standard and Poor's 500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lipper Inc., the research firm, the average United
States diversified equity fund, a proxy for actively managed stock
funds, returned 12.7 percent from Sept. 30 through Thursday, versus
10.8 percent for the average S&AMP;P 500 index fund.
</P>
<P>
   Unless something upsets the markets in the next two weeks, this
will be the third quarter in a row in which active stock fund
managers beat the index. ``The mutual fund managers really earned
their fees this year,'' said Edward S. Rosenbaum, director of
research at Lipper.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling the active managers' outperformance was their voracious
appetite for technology stocks _ the market's golden sector. ``As
growth stock managers, they jumped in with both feet,'' Rosenbaum
said, adding that the sizzling market for new issues had also
helped active managers' relative performance, because index funds
generally don't buy such offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 25 largest funds, the Janus 20 was named by Lipper as
the best performer in the quarter through Thursday, returning 30.7
percent, followed by Janus Worldwide, 29.9 percent, and Fidelity
Growth, 29 percent. The biggest fund, Fidelity Magellan, beat the
second-largest, Vanguard 500 Index, 12 percent to 11 percent.

INVESTING WITH HERBERT E. EHLERS AND DAVID G. SHELL: HERITAGE
CAPITAL APPRECIATION FUND

  (ART ADV: Graphic of Heritage Capital Appreciation is being sent to
NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes, Herbert E. Ehlers and David G. Shell sound as if they
would rather be venture capitalists than money managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a capitalist society like America, wealth is created
through long-term ownership of growing businesses,'' said Ehlers,
co-lead portfolio manager with Shell of the $287.1 million Heritage
Capital Appreciation fund in Tampa, Fla. ``We talk about buying
businesses, not shares of stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Their approach has produced a record that _ although it may pale
next to a venture capitalist's payoff _ is more than respectable.
The fund has returned 36.4 percent a year, on average, for the
three years through Dec. 10, compared with 20.7 percent for its
peer group of large blend funds and 25.7 percent for the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago
financial publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Ehlers, 60, and Shell, 37, work with five other portfolio
managers in running more than $15 billion for Goldman Sachs Asset
Management. The other investments include separate accounts and
three other mutual funds. The largest fund is the $3.10 billion
Goldman Sachs Capital Growth, which uses the same strategy as
Heritage but is more diversified and has a shorter record. (Goldman
bought Ehler's firm, Liberty Investment Management, in 1997.)
</P>
<P>
   When picking stocks, generally of high-quality American growth
companies with market capitalizations of more than $1 billion, the
managers consider myriad factors, focusing on three:
</P>
<P>
   _ Strong business franchises. Shell said they looked for
companies with strong brand names or patented products, or for
businesses that make key components for other companies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Management strength. Specifically, they examine how top
executives allocate a company's capital. ``It's important that cash
be deployed wisely to continue growing the business,'' Shell said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Long-term growth prospects. The managers ignore companies'
earnings in favor of cash flow, for which they like to see growth
of 12 percent to 15 percent a year. They also look for a similar
growth rate in what they call a company's intrinsic worth _ ``what
a rational and knowledgeable business operator would pay to own the
business,'' Shell said.
</P>
<P>
   They tend to steer clear of slow-growing and cyclical companies
like utilities, commodity chemical and transportation concerns.
Some keys to long-term growth, Ehlers said, are long product life
cycles, strong competitive advantages and favorable demographics.
</P>
<P>
   Ehlers and Shell are also fond of companies with pricing power
over their goods or services. But the managers won't pay too much
for their stocks: They look to buy those that trade at a discount
of at least 20 percent to intrinsic worth.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, they see value among companies in the media business.
</P>
<P>
   They recently added to their position in Liberty Media, a
tracking stock of AT&AMP;T. Liberty owns stakes in Sprint PCS, Time
Warner, Discovery Communications, and USA Networks, among other
cable programming and communications stocks. Shell said Liberty
management allocated its capital particularly well.
</P>
<P>
   The fund managers originally bought shares in 1993 at $3 each.
Earnings are not particularly meaningful in the programming
business, but the value of the business is growing at an annual
rate of 20 percent to 30 percent, Shell said. The stock closed on
Friday at $49.4375, and he estimates that it intrinsic worth is
between $55 and $60.
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite is CBS, which is expected to complete its
merger with Viacom in the first half of next year. CBS, of course,
has a strong brand, and Ehlers called its chairman, Mel Karmazin,
``the best leader in the broadcast business.''
</P>
<P>
   Ehlers said radio in particular was benefiting from the growth
of the Internet, because Internet companies use radio advertising
to build their brand names. And CBS's cash flow is growing at more
than 20 percent a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The managers began buying CBS shares in early 1998 at $30; the
stock closed on Friday at $59.8125. Ehlers put the company's
intrinsic net worth at $65 to $70 a share.
</P>
<P>
   The managers also like Time Warner, whose media reach includes
the Warner Brothers studio, cable networks like CNN and HBO and
magazines ranging from Time to InStyle to Mutual Funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The backbone for its strong business franchise,'' Ehlers said,
``is its library of entertainment copyrights, which is the largest
in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has substantial recurring revenue streams from its
cable and magazine businesses and generates reasonable amounts of
free cash flow, he said. Demographics are in the company's favor,
too: The aging population has more time for entertainment-related
activities, Ehlers said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock has experienced weakness this year. Last
month, Jessica Reif Cohen, a Merrill Lynch analyst, published a
report expressing concern about Time Warner's music business. The
stock, which closed on Friday at $66.125, is down 16 percent from
its high of $78.625 in April.
</P>
<P>
   That does not faze the two managers. ``We believe the underlying
fundamentals of the company are very strong and we're still very
bullish,'' Shell said.
</P>
<P>
   They first bought the stock in 1990 at about $12; Ehlers puts
the intrinsic worth at $100 a share.

SLOWER GROWTH AT DELL HAS LEFT A SOUR TASTE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 19)

 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is Dell Computer a value stock for the new economy? Perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, many people on Wall Street called Dell a niche
player, one whose growth would sputter once it saturated the base
of customers who want to buy a personal computer through a
toll-free phone number.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the Dell sales running at $27 billion a year,
investors are not calling it that anymore. But there is still much
doubt about the sustainability of Dell's growth, which is one
reason that its stock has languished all year.
</P>
<P>
   Dell shares, a mainstay of the 1990s bull market, took a
pounding in February, when some analysts predicted that the
company's revenue growth would slow. And it turned out the rate had
declined, to 38 percent for the quarter ending Jan. 31, from 56
percent, on average, over the previous two years. It has since
recovered a bit, to 41 percent in the most recent quarter, ended
Oct. 29.
</P>
<P>
   The message to investors, however, was clear: No one should
expect a company of Dell's size to keep growing at 50 percent
indefinitely. And shareholders have not forgiven the slip. Dell
shares, now at $45.5625, are 17 percent below their 52-week high.
</P>
<P>
   Even with that decline, it is difficult to find anybody who
questions Dell's strategy or faults its execution. Many people
believe that the company could be the world's largest maker of PCs
within the next year or two, as it continues to take market share
away from Compaq Computer and IBM. It has been the No. 1 supplier
of PCs in the United States for the last two quarters. And with the
start this month of WebPC, a PC geared to the retail consumer, Dell
is finally attacking the home market.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's direct-sales model is well-known: The company builds each
PC to order and sells it directly to consumers, by telephone, the
Web or, for big corporate customers, through a field sales force.
There is little money tied up in inventory and no dealer markups,
allowing it to undercut rivals on price.
</P>
<P>
   By keeping the barest of component inventories itself, Dell
minimizes working capital and maximizes return on that capital. It
has a negative cash conversion cycle, meaning that it is paid for
finished goods before it pays suppliers for parts.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, Compaq and Hewlett-Packard have taken steps to mimic Dell's
business model and have made some headway at trimming inventories
and costs. But they cannot duplicate Dell's model without cutting
off their dealers, which they fear to do.
</P>
<P>
   All of this leads some investors to say that Dell stock simply
doesn't deserve the punishment it has suffered. ``We're starting to
believe that the assumptions people have made about revenue growth
slowing down could be wrong,'' said Randy Befumo, an analyst with
the Legg Mason Value Trust, a $14 billion mutual fund and a
longtime Dell shareholder. ``It's not that they increase revenue
growth, because the law of large numbers does eventually apply, but
most likely they can sustain the current growth rate much longer
than people expect.'' About 4.6 percent of the fund is invested in
Dell shares.
</P>
<P>
   Befumo said that he believed the growth of the Internet would
spur sales of servers and other PC-related products, and that Dell
would have many chances to gain market share in these categories
and overseas. ``The market will consolidate around the most
efficient player, and that's Dell,'' he said. ``There's no reason
Dell can't have 50 percent market share.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell has a 15 percent share in the United States and 7 percent
overseas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Wolf, an analyst with Warburg Dillon Read, said Dell
shares had underperformed for reasons divorced from fundamentals.
``Momentum investors pulled out of the name,'' he said, referring
to Dell stock. ``They were very big in the name prior to the
February announcement, but once that momentum is broken for any
reason, they jump ship. The reality is, except for a little blip in
the October quarter due to memory pricing, which I ignore, they
have delivered every quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf said that Dell's competitive advantage over IBM and Compaq
appeared to be widening, and that the company was exploiting the
Internet more effectively than other PC makers, not only to sell
its products but also to maintain relationships with customers. He
noted that Dell's price-to-earnings multiple for next year was
under 45, just slightly above its earnings growth rate of about 40
percent, while many technology stocks trade for two or three times
growth.
</P>
<P>
   If Dell's stock-price appreciation matched his expected earnings
growth rate of 40 percent in 2000, shares would hit $63.7875 in the
next 12 months. ``Last week, I lifted it to my No. 1 pick for
2000,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   It is still possible, however, to admire Dell's model but not
the stock. Andrew Neff of Bear Stearns rates Dell ``attractive,'' a
level below ``buy.'' ``Dell uses the Internet, but they don't run
the Internet the way Sun does,'' Neff said, referring to Sun
Microsystems. ``Sun sells to the core of the Internet. There's a
higher focus on companies that own technology, whereas Dell's
competitive advantage has a lot to do with supply chain leverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Kunstler at J.P. Morgan is also waiting for a reason to
lift his rating on Dell from ``market perform.'' He said Dell had
lifted expectations by describing the slowdown for the January
quarter as a one-time event, though it has since become apparent
that it was not. ``The opportunity for them to really exceed
numbers on revenues or earnings is not what it used to be,'' he
said. ``It's not that the business model has become deficient. It
has not. But there's little perceived potential for upside
surprises.''

CAN THE FED FIND THE MIDDLE IN A MARKET OF EXTREMES?

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even with the major market indexes up splendidly this
year, the stock market remains a place where the have-nots vastly
outnumber the haves. Stocks dipping to new lows dominate those
reaching new highs.
</P>
<P>
   And while the NASDAQ composite closed on Friday at a record
high, up 71.16 percent in 1999, 84.8 percent of NASDAQ stocks are
down 10 percent or more from their highs of the year, according to
Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the bifurcated market has frustrated investors
unlucky enough to own shares in companies that are doing fine but
that are not market darlings. Now the market's extreme segmentation
is posing genuine problems for the Federal Reserve, whose policy
makers meet Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Aiming to keep the economy from overheating, the Fed has raised
interest rates three-quarters of a percentage point since June.
Rate increases usually put a damper on stock indexes, but not this
year. That is because the technology and Internet stocks that are
propelling the indexes to record highs are impervious to rising
interest-rate pain. Their capital needs are satisfied at low cost
by venture capitalists and stock market investors, who have money
to burn and pay no attention to rates.
</P>
<P>
   But the recent rate increases have hurt interest-rate sensitive
companies like financial institutions and old-fashioned industrial
concerns by increasing their costs of capital. Companies whose
shares are in the doldrums cannot turn to the stock market for
cheap capital. They must go to banks or the bond market _ and rates
have risen in both. Yields on 30-year government bonds jumped from
6.16 percent to 6.38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And so the Fed finds itself in a corner. On one hand, inflation
does not seem to be in evidence across the country. But the economy
is considerably stronger than the Fed would like it to be, largely
because of consumer spending. And what is driving the consumer into
the stores? None other than the rising stock market.
</P>
<P>
   According to International Strategy and Investment, an
investment advisory group, retail sales closely parallel the stock
market's gains, especially around Christmas. In the fourth quarter
of 1997, for example, retail sales inched up 1 percent; the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 3 percent. In the fourth quarter
last year, retail sales climbed 11 percent and the S&AMP;P jumped 17
percent.
</P>
<P>
   As rising stock indexes stoke the hot economy, they are also
minimizing the effects of the Fed's recent rate increases. But
because these indexes do not reflect the fortunes of all stocks,
the Fed's next moves are made much trickier.
</P>
<P>
   If the Fed wanted to rein in runaway stock prices by raising
rates, it would have to go well beyond the one-quarter-point moves
it is accustomed to making. That could be dangerous. One trader
likened the situation to a lawn with a clump of weeds far
outgrowing the grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you administer too many chemicals to kill the weeds, you
could kill the entire lawn,'' he said. ``To stop this mania, it's
going to take several doses of harsh medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Christine A. Callies, chief United States market strategist at
Credit Suisse First Boston, said: ``The Fed is concerned about an
equity bubble that blunts the influence of Fed policy. But I think
it's politically unrealistic for them to conduct monetary policy
with the goal of cooling off the stock market.'' So the party goes
on. And the stakes rise ever higher.

TORRENTIAL RAINS LEAVE MORE THAN 100 DEAD AND TENS OF THOUSANDS
HOMELESS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ More than 130 people have been killed and
hundreds are missing and presumed dead after three days of
torrential rains that caused mudslides and flooding here and
elsewhere along the Caribbean coast.
</P>
<P>
   The toll is expected to rise as emergency teams begin to shift
from removing stranded survivors to recovering corpses buried under
avalanches of mud. Some 120,000 people have moved from their homes
to makeshift shelters operated by the military and civil defense
groups, and an additional 36,000 are estimated homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst natural catastrophe to hit Venezuela in 50
years,'' President Hugo Chavez said in a somber television address
to the nation on Thursday night. Addressing reporters Friday,
Chavez, a former army colonel who has been visiting disaster zones
dressed in military fatigues, said that although it was too early
to fear that ``thousands are dead, and let's hope it does not come
to that,'' the destruction had been extensive.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has declared a state of emergency here in the capital and
in nine northern states. In those hard-hit areas, many towns and
neighborhoods remained without electricity, telephone service and
drinking water Friday, and some were being inundated by the rivers
of mud and rock that have come crashing down mountainsides.
</P>
<P>
   The disaster is attributed to La Nina, the meteorological
phenomenon that has caused unusually rainy and cool weather
throughout South America in recent months, particularly in the
Andean region. A series of rain storms and floods in neighboring
Colombia has caused even more widespread death, damage and
destruction than here, and forecasts are for the siege of bad
weather to continue for several days.
</P>
<P>
   The most seriously damaged areas are precarious hillside
settlements known as ranchos, where thousands of shacks have been
destroyed and thousands of families uprooted. Since Wednesday, when
Venezuelans went to the polls to approve a new constitution favored
by Chavez, dramatic images of poor, shocked and tearful slum
dwellers hauling what remained of their personal belongings down to
flat land have dominated television coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But numerous affluent neighborhoods, luxury apartment buildings
and even parts of the downtown area of the capital have also been
severely affected, with streets blocked by garbage and tree limbs
and overturned cars that have been swept away by flash floods.
Torrents of mud and sewage flowed into three subway stations in the
Parque Central area, and the city closed its extensive subway
system.
</P>
<P>
   The disaster has also led to the suspension of all air service
at the main international and national airports, including American
and Continental Airline flights between Caracas and Miami, New York
and Houston. With the road between Caracas and Simon Bolivar
International Airport in La Guaira severed at several points, an
estimated 3,000 passengers and airline employees have been stranded
at the main terminal, some since Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the collapse of other transportation links as well,
the government has urged people to remain at home and not to try to
go to work, even though many workers were due to have been paid at
midmonth. As a result, most businesses, stores, banks and
government offices closed Friday for the third day in a row,
leaving many families short of money, food and water.
</P>
<P>
   In some neighborhoods, shuttered or damaged stores were looted
by residents who said they had no provisions. The police and the
military were quickly dispatched to restore order. At the port of
La Guaira, on the other side of a mountain range from the capital,
desperate survivors swarmed over cargo containers of food and other
supplies that had broken open after having been tossed about by the
surging waters.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from that area, a favorite of Caraquenos and foreign
tourists because of its beautiful beaches, Defense Minister Gen.
Raul Salazar predicted that it would take ``between six and seven
years to return the zone to its previous condition.'' Government
officials and insurance executives predicted that damage to public
works and private property would eventually amount to more than $1
billion.

ACCOUNTING FIRM AGREES TO PAY $335 MILLION IN CENDANT CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ernst &AMP; Young agreed Friday to pay $335 million to settle
charges that it failed in its responsibilities when it certified
financial statements that fraudulently inflated the earnings of
Cendant Corp., which operates Ramada Inn hotels and Avis Car rental
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement was by far the largest ever by an accounting firm
accused of improper practices by shareholders, although Ernst &AMP;
Young paid more than $400 million in 1992 in penalties and fines to
settle the claims of federal agencies in connection with the
savings and loan crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Ernst &AMP; Young said in a statement that it had been
duped itself in the Cendant case and had done nothing wrong,
accounting experts said it was a sad day for the profession and
that perhaps new procedures were needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The auditors are supposed to be smart enough that they don't
get duped,'' said Howard Schilit, the president of the Center for
Financial Research and Analysis, an accounting watchdog
organization in Rockville, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the auditors of this particular company are completely
exonerated,'' he added, ``you have to look at the auditing
procedures in general and say there is something very wrong with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts said that Ernst &AMP; Young's failure to detect the
fraud may have been a consequence of cost-cutting which has led big
accounting companies to rely more heavily on younger, less
experienced auditors. Ernst &AMP; Young is the world's third-largest
accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``To maintain the profit margin, they send in young,
inexperienced people to do a lot of the work,'' said Arthur Bowman,
the editor of Bowman's Accounting Report, an independent monthly
newsletter. ``And then they rely on their experienced staff to
review the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernst &AMP; Young said the settlement was not ``an admission of any
wrongdoing,'' adding: ``It is simply a recognition that in the
litigious environment in which we operate today settlements are an
unfortunate reality and sometimes the only realistic option.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, which sets auditing standards, said they had begun
working on tightened procedures for detecting fraud before the
Cendant case became public, and had put new guidelines into effect
in 1998. At present, they said, several academic teams are
evaluating the effectiveness of the anti-fraud measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to be in front of the curve and not to react to
any given case,'' said Arleen Thomas, the vice president at the
institute in charge of professional standards and services.
</P>
<P>
   Only last week, the shareholders, led by the pension funds of
New York state, New York City and California, reached a $2.8
billion settlement with Cendant in the same fraud. The shareholders
said that the fraud took place over three years at CUC
International, an online telephone and shopping services company,
which combined with HFS Inc. in late 1997 to form Cendant Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Cendant's share price rose from 22 5/8 to 24 3/8 at 4 p.m.
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst &AMP; Young's costs could rise even higher as the result of a
suit by Cendant accusing the auditors of malpractice and breach of
contract. But Ernst &AMP; Young has countersued, saying that ``both CUC
management and subsequently Cendant management'' provided the
accountants with ``information they knew was false.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the U.S. attorney's office in Newark, N.J., is
conducting a criminal investigation into the case, which includes
allegations that executives no longer with Cendant sold shares
before the accounting fraud was publicly disclosed. The Securities
and Exchange Commission is also investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst &AMP; Young said it had ``substantial insurance coverage''
that would limit the personal strain on the firm's more than 6,000
partners, including about 2,300 in the United States. The firm
would not discuss its insurance coverage further.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   An insurance broker who has worked out such professional
liability coverage with major corporations for more than 20 years,
said that Ernst &AMP; Young might recover as much as 75 percent of the
settlement claims from perhaps a dozen or more insurers sharing the
policy. Other insurers said it was likely that the companies
providing the insurance would investigate to make sure that the
fraud had not resulted from intentional or criminal acts by the
accountants.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On April 16, 1998, less than four months after its formation in
the merger, Cendant announced that accounting irregularities had
been discovered in CUC units, jolting the market and reducing
Cendant's overall value by $14.4 billion, as shares plunged to $19
from $35. In August, Cendant, with headquarters in Parsippany,
N.J., reported that more than $640 million in profits reported over
the previous three years had been fictional. The inflated profits
helped drive up the share price of CUC International, making the
company more attractive to potential acquirers and benefiting
shareholders, including company executives.
</P>
<P>
   In suits that were consolidated in U.S. District Court in
Newark, the pension funds said that in certifying three annual
reports, seven quarterly reports and as many as twenty federal
registration statements, Ernst &AMP; Young ``knowingly or recklessly
misrepresented'' that its audits of CUC International were
conducted according to proper auditing standards. The pension funds
also contended that Ernst &AMP; Young failed to review quarterly
reporting packages of major CUC International subsidiaries, failed
to require sufficient backup documentation for substantial merger
reserves, and failed to review CUC International's general ledgers
and journal entry adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ernst &AMP; Young failed to perform their watchdog function and
Cendant shareholders paid the price,'' said H. Carl McCall, the New
York state comptroller and the sole trustee of the New York State
Common Retirement Fund. The fund lost $26.5 million when Cendant's
share price plumeted, said Theresa Bourgeois, a spokesman for
McCall, adding that the New York City pension fund lost $35.9
million and the California Public Employees Retirement System lost
$26.9 million.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   McCall's office and several accounting experts said that in the
highest previous settlement of a class-action suit by shareholders
against an accounting firm, Arthur Young, a predecessor of Ernst &AMP;
Young, agreed to pay $63 million to shareholders of Lincoln Savings
&AMP; Loan in 1992, as part of a settlement of $270 million. Another
accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, paid $22.85 million in the same
case, McCall's office said. Shareholders charged that they were led
to believe that they had put their money in government-insured
savings investments, which turned out to be securities.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Arthur Young merged with Ernst &AMP; Whinney to form Ernst
&AMP; Young.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman, who maintains an accounting industry database, said that
two years after Ernst &AMP; Young paid record federal fines and
penalities in 1992, another firm, Deloite &AMP; Touche, paid $312
million in fines and penalties to settle similar federal claims
arising from the savings and loan crisis.

DIAMOND BUYERS WONDER: IS IT REAL OR TREATED? AND DOES IT MATTER?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 19) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BARBARA WHITAKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While nearly all colored gemstones are heated or otherwise
treated to improve their color, diamonds have long been sold in
their pure state, enhanced only by the cutter's art.
</P>
<P>
   ``The diamond more or less maintained a unique sanctity for
centuries,'' said William E. Boyajian, president of the Gemological
Institute of America, an industry educational and research group.
</P>
<P>
   But no longer. These days, a diamond may have been irradiated to
improve its color or drilled with a laser to remove flaws. And in
March, General Electric announced a process, virtually impossible
to detect, that applies high temperature and pressure to make
diamonds whiter. Among the test markets is Borsheim's Fine Jewelry
and Gifts in Omaha, owned by Warren E. Buffett's Berkshire
Hathaway.
</P>
<P>
   Such new technologies can make shopping for diamond jewelry even
more challenging. Experts advise buyers to demand a guarantee that
a stone has not been altered or a written explanation if it has.
Treated diamonds are usually worth less than diamonds that come by
their good looks naturally, but more than diamonds that are
seriously flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Several major retailers _ including Fortunoff, Tiffany and the
chains owned by the Zale Corp. _ said they did not sell altered
diamonds. Some, however, have provided more prominent disclosures
in recent years about when other gems have been treated. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all colored gems on the retail market go through some
treatments, experts say. But, they add, an untreated natural
gemstone would most likely be worth more. Even at those jewelers
that have full disclosure policies, there is no guarantee that the
disclosure is made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because a retailer has trained their people doesn't mean
their people are communicating it at the counter,'' said Antoinette
L. Matlins, the author of several consumer guides including
``Jewelry and Gems: The Buyer's Guide'' (Gemstone Press, 1998).
``Nor does it mean they understood it to begin with.''
</P>
<P>
   Zale, which operates more than 1,300 stores under the names
Zales, Gordon's and Bailey, Banks &AMP; Biddle, says it began
disclosing colored gem treatments in its catalogs about two years
ago. Susan Lanigan, general counsel for Zale, said the company
trained its employees to discuss these treatments and printed
disclosures on receipts. But she said employees might not always
inform consumers directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to tell you that every sales associate does it,'' she
said, ``but I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission offers limited protections. Its
rules generally require that treated gemstones be identified when
the treatment is not permanent or if the gem requires special care,
said Laura J. DeMartino, a staff lawyer. Industry groups have asked
the FTC to require that laser drilling of diamonds or any other
treatment that affects a gem's value be disclosed. The commission
is expected to respond early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Even an expert might not be able to distinguish a GE diamond.
``The amazing thing about this treatment is that it's not
detectable by the major laboratories,'' said Martin Rapaport, a
diamond broker and publisher of Rapaport Diamond Report, a monthly
magazine that covers the gem industry.
</P>
<P>
   GE and its partner, Lazare Kaplan, a major diamond distributor,
say they make sure that stones are properly marked, described and
sold. They are engraved with a minute identification mark visible
with a jeweler's loupe. They are being test-marketed as Monarch
diamonds _ alluding to the butterfly's metamorphosis _ in only five
stores, where merchants are instructed to describe and document
their enhancement.
</P>
<P>
   Borsheim's has about 30 for sale, as loose diamonds. The store
also sells diamonds that have been drilled with lasers or whose
fractures, or minute cracks, have been filled with diamond-like
substances.
</P>
<P>
   Susan M. Jacques, Borsheim's chief executive and a member of the
Gemological Institute of America board, said store employees tell
customers how the diamonds have been treated, provide explanatory
brochures and give certificates describing the stones' quality and
treatments when they are sold.
</P>
<P>
   GE says its diamonds, which it expects to account for $30
million of the nation's $10 billion diamond wholesale market next
year, sell in a range from 15 percent less than a similar,
unaltered diamond to just as much.
</P>
<P>
   Elly Rosen, who runs Appraisal Information Services in Brooklyn,
N.Y., estimated that a diamond drilled with lasers is worth 10
percent to 20 percent less than an unaltered diamond of similar
appearance. A diamond whose fractures have been filled is worth 25
percent to 30 percent less, he said. Fillings have to be disclosed,
because they are not permanent.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers themselves might not even know which of their diamonds
or colored gems have been treated, or how. ``The biggest problems
are those merchants _ I'm not even going to refer to them as
jewelers _ who don't know all this stuff and don't care,'' Rosen
said. ``They might as well be selling bananas.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Matlins suggested that consumers protect themselves by
asking about the factors that affect the quality and value of any
gem: color, cut, clarity and weight. They should also ask
specifically if the stone has been treated in any way. If the
answer is no, it should be stated in writing on the invoice. If the
answer is yes, the procedures should be spelled out. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to diamonds, she said, a shopper should ask
specifically about laser drilling, fracture filling and GE's new
process.
</P>
<P>
   To verify that the gem and the jeweler's description match, a
buyer should take the purchase and the invoice to an independent
appraiser certified by groups like the American Society of
Appraisers, the American Gem Society or the Accredited Gemologists
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the FTC guidelines the onus is on the consumer,'' Ms.
Matlins said. ``The bottom line is that the consumer today has to
know more than the salesperson to protect themselves.''

NEW RULE ON HIGH-DEFINITION TV ANGERS TOSHIBA AND HITACHI 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The trade group that creates standards for
television sets has determined, in essence, that some very
expensive high-definition television sets being sold by Hitachi and
Toshiba are not HDTVs after all.
</P>
<P>
   A new standard approved on Thursday by the trade group, the
Consumer Electronics Association, comes as a rude shock to the two
companies at the height of the holiday shopping season as well as
to consumers who have already bought the sets in question. Hitachi
is threatening legal action.
</P>
<P>
   ``That vote was invalid,'' Gary Bennett, executive vice
president for Hitachi, said Friday afternoon. ``There are some very
serious legal issues here. We're going to look at an injunction, or
a lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Toshiba executive added: ``That vote is being contested
right now. We absolutely don't recognize that vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Both companies said they would continue selling the televisions
under question and would continue to represent them as
high-definition sets, despite the standard.
</P>
<P>
   All major manufacturers, including Hitachi and Toshiba, are
represented in the electronics association.
</P>
<P>
   The first high-definition sets began appearing on store shelves
16 months ago, initially inspiring more curiosity than sales.
</P>
<P>
   The industry reported last month, however, that the new
technology was finally beginning to take off. More than 21,000
high-definition sets were sold in October _ a 42 percent increase
over the previous month.
</P>
<P>
   Since data are not broken down by individual manufacturers, it
was not clear Friday what percentage of those sales were the
Hitachi and Toshiba sets in question. Both companies have policies
of not releasing their sales figures.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the first products went on sale in August 1998, the
Consumer Electronics Association reached an agreement that detailed
what level of resolution and clarity the new televisions would have
to be capable of offering to be marketed as high-definition sets.
</P>
<P>
   The two most important rules were that the sets had to offer
1,080 lines of resolution (compared with the 480 lines on
conventional sets) and that they must achieve that definition on a
wide, or ``letterbox'' shaped, screen.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the last year, however, Hitachi and Toshiba have
been selling sets, ranging in price from $2,200 to well over
$5,000, that do not appear to meet those criteria.
</P>
<P>
   The sets offer 1,080 lines of resolution, but they have
conventional, square screens. And if a wide screen, high-definition
show is displayed in letterbox in the center of the screen, the
resolution of that smaller picture is reduced by 25 percent _ below
the industry standard. The resolution is lower because 25 percent
of the screen _ and thus a fourth of the lines that determine a
set's resolution _ is not being used.
</P>
<P>
   All other manufacturers selling HDTVs _ including Mitsubishi,
Panasonic, Philips, Sony and Thomson _ make sets that meet all the
requirements. Thomson, which makes RCA and Proscan televisions,
sells two models that have the same problem as the square-screen
Toshiba and Hitachi models. But Thomson does not market those sets
as HDTVs.
</P>
<P>
   Hitachi and Toshiba have argued that the rule did not apply to
their sets because an earlier agreement referred to ``complete
products or systems.'' Their televisions are technically digital
monitors, meaning they require a separate digital tuner box to
receive HDTV.
</P>
<P>
   After months of discussion and debate, the video board of the
Consumer Electronics Association voted on Thursday to revise the
agreement to close the ``loophole they had been using,'' one member
of the board said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good-faith effort to make sure consumers know what
they are buying,'' said Gary Shapiro, head of the association.
</P>
<P>
   The association's solution was simply to expand the definition
to monitors as well as ``complete products or systems.''
</P>
<P>
   The board vote was 6-3 in favor of the modification. Toshiba,
Hitachi and Thomson voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Arland, a spokesman for Thomson, said Thomson's leaders
believed the definition should be even more specific.
</P>
<P>
   Toshiba and Hitachi also make widescreen models that meet the
industry standard. And anyone buying the square-screen televisions
in question will find that they present a picture that is notably
better than a conventional television can offer. But the resolution
will never be as sharp as that of fully compliant models.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, the Hitachi executive vice president, who is a member
of the panel that voted on Thursday, argued then and in an
interview Friday that the vote was not valid because there was not
a proper quorum.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need two-thirds of the committee's members for a quorum,''
he asserted, ``so the vote was invalid.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro, while being careful not to criticize members, said the
association rules stipulated that only 50 percent of the members
were needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a quorum,'' he said. ``I don't think that is really
the issue. And they know they can appeal this to the executive
board if they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday evening, Bennett said he would do just that and added
that perhaps his assertion about the quorum was off base.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro said, ``My guess is that the rule will stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there may be enough wiggle room to get Hitachi and
Toshiba through the holiday season without having to relabel their
sets. Though the standard was approved on Thursday, no effective
date was set, and Shapiro suggested that, as a compromise, the
effective date might be pushed back.
</P>
<P>
   That would give the two companies a chance to sell off their
inventory of the noncompliant sets while they can still be labeled
HDTVs.

TEACHER DONATES A KIDNEY TO A STUDENT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By EMILY YELLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. _ Jane Smith, a middle school teacher in
Fayetteville, was always telling Michael Carter, a student of hers,
to pull up his baggy pants. What Ms. Smith did not know was that
Michael suffered from kidney disease and that the illness, and
resulting dialysis, left him routinely sore.
</P>
<P>
   So when she made one too many demands about those pants,
``finally he got exasperated with me,'' Ms. Smith recalled, ``and
said: `I can't. I'm on dialysis. I need a kidney transplant.' And I
said: `Well, I have two. Do you want one?'''
</P>
<P>
   That extraordinary offer led the 14-year-old Michael and the
42-year-old Ms. Smith to the University of North Carolina Hospitals
on Thursday for transplant surgery. Michael is to get his new
kidney, and Ms. Smith is to add organ donor to the roles she
already has in his life, as his teacher for both home room and
general science.
</P>
<P>
   The operation, scheduled for Friday, was postponed after Michael
developed a low-grade fever. The antibiotics that he is now being
given at the hospital to fight the infection, so far of
undetermined cause, meant that he could not be given immune
suppressant drugs that transplant patients receive to ensure that
their bodies will not reject the new organ.
</P>
<P>
   But the delay is only a minor setback to Michael and his
parents, who have learned to endure a lot more. ``This too shall
pass,'' his mother, Deborah Evans, said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael, the second of five children of Mrs. Evans and her
husband, Richard, a 50-year-old home builder, was found to have
kidney disease when he was only 16 months old. At 13 years, one
kidney stopped functioning entirely. He has been receiving dialysis
treatment ever since.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, a donor was sought from among Michael's
friends and relatives. But medical tests failed to find a match.
</P>
<P>
   Then, soon after the beginning of the current school year, Ms.
Smith, an eighth-grade teacher at the R. Max Abbott Middle School
in Fayetteville, learned of Michael's illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I instantly knew that this was something I could do,'' she
said, ``that there was no pain I could suffer that would be as
great as what Michael was going through.''
</P>
<P>
   After a battery of tests and many anxious moments, teacher and
student were told that they were a match, and the surgery was
scheduled to coincide with the school's Christmas break.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith, the divorced mother of a 12-year-old boy, says she
has never had second thoughts about her decision. Michael's illness
``is holding him back,'' she said. ``He's got a good mind, and he's
got the desire. But he just hasn't had the physical energy to
follow through.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Evans says she and her family are still stunned by Ms.
Smith's generosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had anyone to reach out like that,'' she said,
``someone outside my family. It says a lot. No matter what you're
going through, no matter how difficult the situation may appear,
there is an answer out there. You just have to be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   That Michael is black and Ms. Smith white has also inspired
many, not only people here in North Carolina but those across the
country who have seen reports about the two of them on national
television.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, though, Ms. Smith has played down her role,
saying she hopes the story will simply call attention to the need
for organ donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this world you need to realize that there's a bond,'' she
said. ``There's a connection between you and everybody else you
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith and Mrs. Evans are both devout Baptists, and say their
religious faith has helped them through the experience. ``God chose
us together,'' Mrs. Evans said, ``to accomplish his purpose'' _ to
extend Michael's life and raise consciousness about organ donating.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith says that when she found out in October that she was a
match for Michael, she spoke to her own son first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I was not going to be taken away from him because
of it,'' she said, ``and that Michael had a need, and this was
something that was a miracle that we could fix.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Evans remembers that when she learned of the match, she
went to the school and found Ms. Smith, and they hugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like our whole soul became one,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Mrs. Evans says, she offered up special prayers for Ms.
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to the Lord, `thank you for that lady, thank you for
Jane Smith.' I was so grateful, but I was getting bold with the
Lord. I was getting tough. I said: `Don't you ever let her want for
anything, Lord. Don't even let her want for a Kleenex. God, don't
you let her tire go flat.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I was going down the list, because I couldn't ever
repay her enough for what she had done.''

<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ LearnLinc, a small educational software company,
needs an experienced project manager. There is a woman at MapInfo,
a larger software company nearby, who fits the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Almost anywhere else, Degerhan Usluel, the chief executive of
LearnLinc, would go a-wooing on his own. But this is Troy, a place
where ``thou shalt not raid'' has become a new commandment. Usluel
called Michael D. Marvin, MapInfo's chairman, and struck a deal in
which the woman would work for Usluel for two years, then return to
MapInfo. ``We're getting the person we need, and MapInfo gets a
free retraining program for a valued employee,'' Usluel said.
</P>
<P>
   Forget how hard it is for high-technology companies to hold on
to talent in a climate of cutthroat recruiting. Here in New York's
Capital Region, an area of about a million people that ranks low on
most wish-I-lived-there lists, local software companies are not
only staying off one another's turf, but are also nurturing one
another's employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone stays in town, you may get him back,'' explained
John C. Haller, one of MapInfo's founders. ``If he goes to
California, he's gone forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Such thinking has fostered a merry-go-round of job hops. Haller,
for example, was feeling restless after 10 years with MapInfo;
Marvin arranged for him to teach classes at the Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute here and to consult with Powerradz.com, a
smaller local start-up, until his juices were flowing again. Six
months later, Haller returned to MapInfo as chief technology
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, three years later, Haller and Steve Lombardi, another
MapInfo employee, are starting a new Internet company with
MapInfo's money. ``I had just gotten a great job offer in
California, and they knew it would take an Internet project to keep
me here,'' Lombardi said.
</P>
<P>
   Other unlikely regions are nurturing collegial bunches of high
tech companies, of course. The Lehigh Valley, once the heart of Big
Steel, is becoming a high tech bastion. Lower Manhattan, once
synonymous with Wall Street, has carved out its own ``Silicon
Alley.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Lehigh Valley is home to Lucent Technologies, a definite
high-tech draw. New York City hosts publishing and other industries
that provide the content that fuels many web startups.
</P>
<P>
   Holding on to employees is an uphill battle here. Despite the
looming presence of RPI _ and a growing base of about 200 software
companies with combined revenues of about $300 million this year _
the Capital Region of Albany, Schenectady and Troy is noted mainly
for bleak weather and state politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still this perception that California is the golden
world, that the Northeast is this cold and rusty place,'' said
Michael H. Wacholder, director of the Rensselaer Technology Park,
home to most of the software companies.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the companies collaborate instead of competing. They
take turns playing host to monthly beer parties for younger
employees. They exchange salary information, evaluate one another's
business strategies and critique one another's presentations to
venture capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   And they gang up on anyone who breaks the unwritten rules. A few
years ago, one local company began wooing employees from its
neighbors. Usluel let it grab one LearnLinc programmer. ``But I
said, `You take one more person from me, I'll spend whatever it
takes to buy two from you,''' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the company approached someone at MapInfo. Marvin
called the chairman, gently reminded him that he ``wasn't playing
by the rules'' and implied that he would be frozen out of all local
activities if he persisted with raids. The MapInfo employee stayed
put, and other local software chiefs say the would-be raider has
kept his distance since.
</P>
<P>
   But tales of rivalry are far outnumbered by those of
collaboration: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   _ In the last 11 years Joseph M. Clement has been the first
human resources chief at Chart Inc., MapInfo, Comsoft, and now, IA
Systems, which makes software for the banking industry. In each
case, as soon as he grew restless, his bosses helped him land a new
job within driving distance of the old one.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kathy Dinardo, Marvin's administrative assistant, had
breakfast with Donna Bonaquisiti, who was seeking a job at MapInfo.
Ms. Dinardo liked her but knew that LearnLinc needed an office
manager, so she sent her there. Ms. Bonaquisiti got the job.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last month, Clement met someone at a job fair who did not seem
right for IA Systems; at his suggestion, another local company,
Aptis, took the man on. Conversely, Clement called a former
colleague at MapInfo last week for leads on sales staff. ``She gave
me the name of someone she thought was great, but figured would be
a better fit for us,'' Clement said.
</P>
<P>
   MapInfo's name keeps cropping up in these stories. As the oldest
and biggest of the area's high-technology firms _ this year, it
will take in revenues close to $100 million for its statistical
map-making products _ it incubates much local talent. But most
important, it is home to Marvin, who is so much the spiritual
mentor of the informal Capital Region software circle that the
other chiefs often call themselves the Marvinettes.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin, 54, got hooked on the idea of a technology center here
in 1986, when he was with RPI's Center for Industrial Innovation.
Four recent graduates approached him about heading MapInfo, the
software company they wanted to start. ``These were 21-year-old
boys,'' he said. ``They needed an adult, and I loved the challenge
of proving a high-tech company could make it in Troy.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin was MapInfo's first and third chief executive, and he
remains its chairman. In between he ran LearnLinc, Usluel's
brainchild, until Usluel felt ready to take over. Marvin was also
co-founder of the Exponential Business Development Co., a venture
capital firm that provides seed money for local high-technology
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   He has single-handedly kept several in town. ``Mike Marvin said
he'd give us seed capital if we stayed here, and persuaded us that
we could learn plenty from the other companies,'' said Karthik
Bala, another RPI alumnus, who had planned to move his video game
start-up, Vicarious Visions, to California after graduation in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   MapInfo people helped Vicarious Visions build a compensation
plan for its game developers, and other local chief executives are
helping the company forge a strategy for syndicating games on the
World Wide Web. Vicarious Visions expects $8 million in sales next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Marvinettes switch mentor and student hats with remarkable
ease. Mark J. Chudzicki, founder of Poweradz.com, which helps
newspapers with their Web sites, said he received some great gratis
tips from . Bala on how to put newspaper content online. Chudzicki,
in turn, recently helped LearnLinc tackle some sales forecasting
problems.
</P>
<P>
   He is now conferring with other local executives to find a job
for one of his people, who just doesn't fit the chemistry of the
company, but who Chudzicki still thinks is an asset to the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the critical-mass thing,'' he said. ``You've got to keep
good people in the area even if they don't fit your company.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that raises a question: What happens to all the
gemutlichkeit if the region comes to be viewed as an established
technology center?
</P>
<P>
   Even Marvin has no illusions. ``Once that happens,'' he said,
``the raiding will probably occur.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Dow Jones industrial average, powered by a jump
in General Electric after it announced a 3-for-1 stock split,
flirted with a new high Friday but then gave up the gains in a
selloff at the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the afternoon, the Dow was up 138 points to 11,383,
surpassing its record close of 11,326.04 on Aug. 25. But the
average plummeted at the end of the day and wound up inching only
12.54 points higher, to 11,257.43.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-heavy Nasdaq index, which was up as much as 81
points at Friday's opening, also slumped in the afternoon. But it
still rose 38 points, or 1.02 percent, to 3,753.06, its 10th new
high since Thanksgiving. The Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stock
rose 2.25 points, to 1,421.03, just 12.27 points from the record of
1,433.30 it reached on Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   There was no news to trigger the selloff late Friday. Analysts
said they did not think the selling was a result of the expiration
of the futures contracts and options on stock indexes and the
options on individual stocks, which is known as triple witching.
That did contribute, however, to a day of record trading volume on
the New York Stock Exchange as 1.35 billion shares changed hands.
For the month so far, trading volume is averaging more than 1
billion shares a day.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Galvin, the chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin
&AMP; Jenrette, said the selloff could reflect the ``wrestling match''
going on between investors who have made huge gains this year and
are selling now to protect them, and the buying from money managers
who are trying to dress up their portfolios by buying the
better-performing stocks of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The performance came as interest rates surged to their highest
level in more than two years. For the week, the Dow and the S&AMP;P
rose less than a third of a percentage point, while the Nasdaq
leapt 3.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Because the economy continues to grow briskly despite three rate
increases by the Federal Reserve this year, more and more analysts
are now predicting that the Federal Reserve will raise its
short-term interest rate target a quarter of a percentage point in
February and another quarter of a point before summer.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the fact that the Nasdaq set its 54th record of the
year and the Dow and the S&AMP;P are near records, the stock market's
performance _ outside of technology stocks _ is still sluggish and
many stocks have been left out.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Dow first crossed 11,000 on May 7, it has risen only 2
percent, which means that almost all of its 22.6 percent gain for
the year came by early May. For the S&AMP;P 500 index, which is more
heavily weighted with tech stocks than the Dow, the rise since May
7 has been 5.7 percent. But still, most of its 15.6 percent gain
for the year came by May.
</P>
<P>
   In the same period, the Nasdaq index is up 50 percent, led by
Qualcomm, Oracle, Sun Microsystems, Yahoo and Cisco Systems. For
the year, the index is up 71.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Looked at another way, almost 58 percent of the 500 stocks in
the S&AMP;P 500 index are down 20 percent or more from their 52-week
highs, according to Salomon Smith Barney. Sixty-six percent of the
stocks on the New York Stock Exchange are down 20 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   And this may indicate that the sharp rise in interest rates this
year, which has pushed the yield on the 30-year bond up almost one
and a half percentage points to as high as 6.39 percent, is having
some impact. In this higher rate environment investors are favoring
big-name growth companies and the tech and Internet stocks that
have done so well all year.
</P>
<P>
   In late trading in the bond market Friday, the yield on the
30-year bond slipped a little to 6.37 percent from 6.39 percent on
Thursday. The price, which moves in the opposite direction, rose
5/32, to 96 22/32.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of GE, which also announced a dividend increase, rose 4
1/2, to 151 7/8.
</P>
<P>
   Investors expressed little enthusiasm Friday for a possible
merger between drug giants Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn and Monsanto. Reports
surfaced that the two companies were discussing a deal, but that
was not enough to spark a rally in either stock. Shares of Monsanto
increased a meager 3.4 percent, or $1.375, to close at $41.75.
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn's stock tumbled 6.3 percent, or $3, to close at
$50.25.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judging by what happened Friday, Monsanto is not likely to go
at a premium,'' said Tom Brakel, an analyst with Mehta Partners.
``And if they do this deal, Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn still has to figure
out what to do with Monsanto's agricultural division.''

POLITICAL REBEL IN BIRMINGHAM FINDS HE'S OUT ALTHOUGH IN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ For years, Bernard Kincaid was the wrench in
the political machine that controlled Alabama's largest city, the
outsider who railed at the vast powers of its 20-year mayor,
Richard Arrington, and tried to assemble a bi-racial coalition of
rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Then last month, the city's voters _ wearied by five terms of
one-man rule and angry at fiscal carelessness that slopped over
into scandal _ elected Kincaid as mayor. He defeated Arrington's
handpicked successor.
</P>
<P>
   Kincaid, who had been a City Council member for two years,
demanded resignations, ordered audits and promised a new day in
Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   It did not take long, however, for Kincaid to become a victim of
the same fears and hostilities that propelled him into office, a
legacy of the divisive tenure of his predecessor and the city's
polarized racial history.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of his victory, he began clashing with a City
Council that was as suspicious of his intentions as he had been of
Arrington's. Last week, in a vote similar to actions he had long
advocated, Kincaid was stripped of much of his power by a unanimous
City Council, which forbid him to execute contracts larger than
$10,000 without the Council's approval.
</P>
<P>
   Political rebellion often seems to come at a price in the cities
of the Deep South, where clouds of racial suspicion hover over so
many voting booths. When Arrington swept away years of often
oppressive all-white rule to become the city's first black mayor in
1979, he and his allies felt little need to reach out to the white
residents who began deserting the city by the tens of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Kincaid is also black, but his challenge to that coalition has
earned him the lasting bitterness of most Council members. Even his
allies want to ensure that no future mayor ever has as much power
as Arrington had.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what happens when a machine dies,'' said Natalie
Davis, a political scientist at Birmingham Southern College. ``When
all the power is inside the African-American community, you're
going to have black-against-black competition. And now all those
voters who never got contracts, who watched everything from
unethical behavior to outright stealing, are going to turn every
Council meeting into a weekly slugfest.''
</P>
<P>
   Kincaid is fighting back, threatening to sue the Council and
laying plans for a citywide referendum to regain his power to
approve contracts. But he says he is resigned to spending nearly
half of his term in a virtual stalemate with the Council, delaying
his hopes for improving the city's schools and transit system, at
least until the Council members are up for re-election in 2001. He
considers that a small price to pay for dislodging a political
movement that had lost its vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will probably cripple my administration for the next 22
months, but then those individuals on the Council will stand for
election,'' he said in an interview. ``And the public will be left
to judge if they like my brand of leadership or theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Kincaid, 54, is a former administrator at the University of
Alabama at Birmingham who earned a doctorate in education
administration and a law degree. A coal miner's son who attended
Miles College just outside Birmingham, he knew and admired
Arrington when the former mayor taught zoology there. He says he
welcomed Arrington's early efforts to integrate the city's work
force and end the tension between the police and black residents.
</P>
<P>
   But like many critics of Arrington, white and black, Kincaid
grew disenchanted with the insularity of the Arrington
administration and the all-black political coalition from which it
drew strength, the Jefferson County Citizens Coalition. There were
constant investigations into cronyism and kickbacks, and two
convictions of mayoral allies on fraud charges. Arrington even
timed his retirement in July to allow William Bell, the Council
president, to serve as interim mayor until the election.
</P>
<P>
   But Bell could not overcome the weight of his patron's many
years in power, despite raising 10 times as much campaign money as
Kincaid's $120,000. In the campaign, a councilman allied with
Kincaid disclosed that the Arrington administration had paid
$891,000 to buy a three-acre parcel from a friend of Arrington in
1994, as the site for a housing project. When the Council approved
the sale in a rubber-stamp action, it had been told the city was
buying 30 acres.
</P>
<P>
   The city eventually sold the land for a $700,000 loss, giving
Kincaid a resonant campaign issue. Associates of Bell and Arrington
were also shown to have been paid millions for promoting a plan to
sell the city's water system, which the voters rejected last year.
On Nov. 2, Kincaid, once the most distant of long shots, defeated
Bell with 51 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably couldn't have won without those things happening,''
Kincaid said. ``It turned out the mayor's plan to install Bell
backfired, because these things came out while he was sitting in
that seat. They just enveloped him like a blooming flower, and all
of a sudden he didn't look so mayoral.''
</P>
<P>
   The rift between the factions only deepened after the election.
Arrington waited three weeks before sending a terse note of
congratulations to his successor. Bell, who has served on the
Council for 20 years, retained his seat, and joined four other
Arrington allies on the nine-member Council to begin limiting the
new mayor's power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony of that simply can't go unmentioned,'' said an
editorial in The Birmingham News, which had endorsed Bell. ``Here
are five people who rubber-stamped everything Mayor Arrington ever
wanted with the gusto of a mad postal clerk, and now they want to
put a leash on Kincaid in the name of accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   The paradox can also be inverted, because Kincaid was one of the
loudest proponents of greater oversight of mayoral contracts when
he sat on the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six weeks ago, he would have led the charge for this,'' said
Dr. Jimmy Blake, a white Council member who supported Kincaid.
``That's because we had a king for mayor all those years. I'm not
the least bit interested in having another one.''
</P>
<P>
   Kincaid did not help matters when he hired as a top legal aide a
lawyer who had been disbarred and convicted of forgery. But he
remains convinced that his real enemy is the bitterness of the
city's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that this is the nadir of Arrington's coalition,''
he said. ``But those walls between us were erected pretty heavily
during the two years I was on the Council. Now, I don't know how
they're going to be lowered.''

   SEATTLE _ A man who brought a car with a trunk full of
explosives on a ferry from Canada, and then led customs officials
on a foot chase through the streets of a Washington port town, was
arrested by federal authorities. They said Friday that his target,
his motives and his background remain a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The man, who had more than 150 pounds of bomb-making chemicals
and detonator components in the car, was detained Tuesday just
after driving off a ferry from Victoria, British Columbia, in Port
Angeles, Wash. He had a reservation for a downtown Seattle motel
Tuesday night, and also had reserved tickets to fly Wednesday from
Seattle to New York and to connect from there to a London-bound
flight, federal authorities said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and the CIA are investigating the incident, a government
official said Friday. How and when the man planned to use the
materials in his car are just two of the numerous questions
surrounding the incident. Although, as one government official said
Friday: ``There's nothing mysterious at all about what was in that
car. It was stuff for a bomb, a powerful bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said the man's actions, use of fake
Canadian identification papers and background fueled suspicions
that he could be part of an international terrorist network.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said they believe the man is Algerian, is 28 years
old and that his name is Ahmed Ressam. They say he arrived in Los
Angeles on Feb. 7 on a flight from Seoul, South Korea, and that he
was next seen in Vancouver, British Columbia, in October. They said
his passport, which listed his name as Benni Noris and gave his age
as 28, was false. The officials also believe that both of the
Canadian driver's licenses, bearing his picture, that he was
carrying were falsely obtained. One was under the name of Benni
Antoine Noris
</P>
<P>
   The suspect was carrying maps of Washington, Oregon and
California in the car with him, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers federal prosecutors indicated that he would be
charged, under the name of Ahmed Ressam, with illegally
transporting explosive material into the country and making false
statements on his customs forms.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest comes after a recent State Department warning that it
had received ``credible information'' about plans for terrorist
attacks against U.S. citizens around the time of the Jan. 1
millennium celebration. The department's ``worldwide terrorism
warning'' advised Americans to stay away from ``large gatherings
and celebrations'' throughout the world for the rest of this year,
but it did not specify any groups planning attacks or state where
such attacks might occur.
</P>
<P>
   Two federal officials in Washington said Friday that the CIA had
been called in on the case. One of them said the intelligence
service was asked to join the case because of suspicions that the
man may be tied to terrorists.

SEIZED CHEMICALS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO `TAKE OUT A BUILDING' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ED OFFLEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The urea powder and liquid nitroglycerine seized in a
rental car in Port Angeles, Wash., Tuesday night are powerful
enough to destroy a mid-sized office building, according to a
military explosives expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going definitely to take a building out with this
stuff,'' said the expert, who reviewed the chemical properties of
the material seized by U.S. Customs officials. ``You could
devastate an office building.''
</P>
<P>
   The expert, who agreed to discuss the incident only on grounds
of anonymity, said a bomb made of the seized materials would have
the equivalent blast power of 100 pounds of TNT.
</P>
<P>
   Customs inspectors found 118 pounds of urea powder, about 16
ounces of nitroglycerine in two glass jars, and four small black
boxes containing circuit boards, watches and nine-volt batteries in
the wheel well of a car trying to enter the United States on a
ferry from Victoria, B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary tests conducted at the Washington State Patrol
Laboratory in Tacoma confirmed that the material, when combined
with a detonator, would produce ``a large explosive device,''
according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Ressam, 33, was in federal custody Friday night, facing
explosive and immigration charges. He is an Algerian wanted in
Canada who intended to stay in the United States only a day, then
fly to London.
</P>
<P>
   Urea is a fine white powder used to manufacture explosives and
fertilizer. It has similar properties to ammonium nitrate, another
fertilizer ingredient that can easily be made into a high
explosive, the expert said.
</P>
<P>
   The expert expressed relief that the liquid nitroglyerin seized
by border agents was apparently well stabilized, apparently with
sawdust. ``Liquid nitro is pretty nasty _ it's twice as sensitive
as the explosive in a blasting cap,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The liquid nitroglycerine _ a powerful explosive in its own
right _ would normally be used for the initial detonation that
would in turn trigger the detonation of the urea powder, the expert
said. Detonating the nitroglycerine would merely require a small
blasting cap fired by a battery-driven igniter, the expert said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five pounds of that stuff could take a car apart,'' the expert
said of the mixture.
</P>
<P>
   The terrorist bomb that blew up under the New York World Trade
Center on Feb. 26, 1993 _ killing six people and injuring more than
1,000 _ was made with 1,200 pounds of urea nitrate combined with
fuel oil.
</P>
<P>
   Bombs used to destroy two U.S. embassies in East Africa last
year were made of ammonium nitrate common to fertilizers, as was
the 1995 bomb that blew up the federal building in Oklahoma City.,
Okla., killing 168.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki and legislative leaders from
both major parties agreed Friday to raise the state's cigarette tax
by 55 cents a pack in an ambitious effort to provide health care
coverage for as many as one million uninsured New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki and leaders of the Legislature also decided to renew a
financial program that pays hospitals about 1.3 billion a year to
train new doctors and treat poor people who show up in emergency
rooms with no way of paying their medical bills. The program had
been set to expire at the end of the year, threatening the state's
health care system with financial uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   The plan to expand coverage for the uninsured is expected to
cost the state about $750 million over the next 3 1-2 years. It
would be financed with revenue from the higher cigarette tax, as
well as a share of the $450 million a year that the state is to
receive from the settlement of the national lawsuit against tobacco
companies. The plan would also be paid for with about $300 million
in new federal health care funds.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement represents one of the most ambitious investments
in health care by the state in recent memory. It also concludes a
series of tense talks between Pataki, a Republican, and the
Democratic speaker of the Assembly, Sheldon Silver, over how to
finance the state's multibillion-dollar health care industry and
provide coverage for the growing number of medically uninsured New
Yorkers, who now number more than 3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would bring New York's tobacco tax to $1.11 a pack, the
highest of any state, and represents the first significant defeat
here for the tobacco industry since 1993. The industry has long
been one of the most powerful interest groups in state politics,
but recent disclosures about its extravagant spending on gifts for
lawmakers and other lobbying expenditures have weakened its
position. Some lawmakers acknowledge that they hope to use the
higher tax to rebuff charges that they are too close to the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations were largely orchestrated by Dennis Rivera, the
influential head of 1199, the National Health and Human Service
Employees Union, which represents 150,000 health care workers in
the state. Rivera had threatened to use his group's political clout
and financial resources to mount a fierce media campaign against
Pataki and his Republican allies in the Legislature if they moved
to reduce state financing for hospitals or refused to expand
medical coverage for the uninsured. He enlisted the support of not
only Democrats but Republicans as well, primarily Joseph Bruno, the
State Senate majority leader. Bruno shared the governor's concerns
over the state's rising health care costs, but also did not want to
pick a fight with labor unions over the issue. with an important
election year approaching.
</P>
<P>
   Before the deal was reached, the negotiations had stalled over
the question of how to structure the new insurance program.
Democrats had proposed modeling it after the Medicaid program, with
the state providing coverage directly to the uninsured using
federal and state funds. But Pataki was concerned that such an
approach would encourage employers to stop offering their workers
medical insurance and instead let the state and federal governments
provide it. He wanted to offer financial incentives for private
employers to expand coverage for workers.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the two sides agreed on a compromise that attempts
to accomplish both of their goals over the next 3 1-2years. The
agreement calls for providing free insurance to families earning up
to 150 percent of the federal poverty line _ meaning that a family
of four with an annual income of $25,000 or less could receive
coverage without paying premiums. The program would cost nearly
$600 million in state and federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for providing $219 million in state subsidies to
small businesses to help them provide medical coverage to their
employees. The money would be given to businesses with up to 50
employees. The agreement also sets aside $150 million to help
individuals buy their own medical coverage from private insurance
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said he expected as many as 500,000 uninsured New Yorkers
to apply for medical coverage over the next 3 1-2 years as a result
of the new health care initiative. ``I am confident that with this
program, we are going to have the best health care in the country,
possibly the world,'' the governor said during an afternoon news
conference at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also includes a major concession to Pataki: it keeps a
lid on the state's fast-growing Medicaid costs. Pataki has proposed
cuts in Medicaid spending in the past, only to be rebuffed by his
Democratic rivals nearly every year. But the deal announced Friday
would reauthorize a series of Medicaid cuts that are due to expire
on April 1. Those cuts total $1 billion a year in federal, state
and local financing for the Medicaid program, and the deal would
extend them for three years.

 ART- 2NDTAKE-NYT  
 ALBANY , N.Y. : three years. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The additional tobacco tax is expected to raise about $400
million a year for the state. The last increase in the state's
cigarette tax came in 1993, when it climbed to 56 cents a pack,
from 39 cents. At the time, that was the highest rate in the
country, but 13 other states have since adopted higher rates. New
Jersey's cigarette tax is 80 cents a pack, Connecticut's is 50
cents and Pennsylvania's is 31 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The measure marks the first time that Pataki has championed a
major tax increase since taking office in 1995 on an aggressive
tax-cutting platform. The tax increase could help him deflect
criticism over the fact that Philip Morris, the tobacco giant,
helped pay for two trips that he and his family took to Hungary in
1995 and 1996, an issue that is now the subject of a state ethics
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The move was lauded by anti-tobacco groups, which have long
asserted that a higher tax would discourage people, particularly
teen-agers, from smoking and lead others to quit. ``The 55-cent
cigarette tax hike could move New York to the front of the pack
nationally in tackling the tobacco menace,'' said Blair Horner, the
legislative director for the New York Public Interest Research
Group, a staunch advocate of policies discouraging tobacco use.
</P>
<P>
   But the measure drew protests from the tobacco industry, where
executives have long opposed tax increases, saying they depress
sales perhaps more than any other tobacco restriction. The industry
also says that such a tax is regressive, hitting the poorest
consumers the hardest, and that it encourages the smuggling of
cigarettes from states with lower taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan McCormick, spokesman for Philip Morris USA, said: ``We
think that it's a bad idea for New York state. The state's coffers
are really full of money in terms of the budget surplus. At a time
when the state's budget is prospering, we think that it's unfair to
single out smokers to pay for increased spending.'' He added, ``At
the same time, there is the potential for a negative business
impact on retailers, especially those located in border areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations between Pataki and Democratic leaders focused
on another critical health care issue: a state law that adds
surcharges to hospital bills to help finance a range of services
provided by hospitals, primarily training young doctors and
providing charity care for the poor. The law, known as the Health
Care Reform Act, is set to expire at the end of the year, and
Pataki and the Democrats have been divided over what changes, if
any, to make to it before renewing it.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's allies in the business sector had been urging him to
eliminate the surcharges altogether, contending that employers end
up paying most of them through higher insurance premiums for their
workers. But Pataki abandoned their cause after they failed to
respond to an expensive advertising campaign that 1199 unveiled in
recent weeks predicting chaos if the surcharges were not preserved.
</P>
<P>
   Before Pataki and Democratic leaders reached an agreement on
renewing the system of surcharges, the negotiations had stalled on
the key question of how much money the state should be providing to
help hospitals train young doctors and provide charity care to the
poor. The issue is of great importance in New York City, where
large numbers of teaching hospitals provide care in poor
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's aides had privately proposed cutting funds for graduate
medical education, saying that the state should not be spending
money to train medical students because they often end up
practicing medicine in other states. The Democrats, meanwhile,
called for increasing the amount of money the state funnels to
hospitals to help treat poor people.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Pataki and Democratic leaders agreed to cut
financing for graduate medical education by $50 million a year, to
$494 million from $544 million. The two sides also agreed to
increase financing for charity care by $100 million a year, to $838
million from $738 million. The leaders also agreed to preserve a
program that provides health insurance for 415,000 low-income
children. That program, called Child Health Plus, is financed
through the system of hospital surcharges at a cost of $200 million
a year.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``He probably got a little fat and happy,'' acknowledged Julian
H. Robertson Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, the man behind Tiger Management, was giving one
reason that his hedge fund family had dwindled from more than $22
billion in assets at its peak last year _ when it pulled even with
George Soros' hedge fund shop _ to about $8 billion today.
</P>
<P>
   For Robertson, who is widely regarded as one of the best
investment managers of his time, the humbling comedown is perhaps
the most dramatic reversal of recent memory in the money management
business _ not only because Tiger has lagged severely behind the
broad stock market over the last 15 months, but also because its
previous record was so dazzling.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of capital _ from both investor withdrawals and
investments _ has made Robertson, 67, a billionaire who in recent
years has started spreading some of his wealth to philanthropies
like Lincoln Center, intent on righting the firm before he retires.
He has already made big changes in some practices _ resulting in a
different business model, Tiger officials say. But he remains
committed to other practices, notably ``value'' investing, which
has been out of favor lately on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   As he ponders who will succeed him, he continues to have the
final say over most investment decisions _ and is trying to
persuade investors, who have removed $5.3 billion in the last year,
not to retreat further.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson blames the huge outflows, in some measure, for Tiger's
dismal performance _ and it is not clear when investors will stop
leaving the fund. Tiger's fourth-quarter redemptions will be paid
in a few weeks, and people on Wall Street say the number could be
close to $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   And though about $1.3 billion of Tiger's money is largely locked
up until July 2002 _ money raised in a special offering two years
ago by Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette _ Robertson was confronted by
some of those investors at a contentious meeting on Nov. 1. One
asked whether an exception to the lockup could be made for longtime
Tiger investors; Robertson replied that he would have to look at
that idea. But a person close to Robertson said Tiger was not
considering letting investors out early.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger officials confirmed that the meeting had become
contentious, but they declined to comment on fourth-quarter
withdrawals, except to say that they would be less than expected. A
person close to the firm also said that while investors in the
special offering are allowed to withdraw a small amount each year,
they took out less than one-fifth of what they could have this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger remains one of the few large players in hedge funds, the
$300 billion world of secretive partnerships that is off-limits to
all but institutions and the wealthiest individuals. Many of
Tiger's investors, which include multimillionaires, endowments and
universities, had to invest at least $10 million to get into the
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Like mutual funds, hedge funds invest pools of investors' money.
But they are different in that they can borrow huge sums to make
freewheeling bets on stocks, bonds, derivatives and other
speculative investments.
</P>
<P>
   Scrutiny of the industry has grown after the bailout of
Long-Term Capital Management, the Greenwich, Conn., fund that
roiled markets last year when its huge bets soured. Congress is
weighing measures that could bring greater disclosure of industry
practices.
</P>
<P>
   But the recent experiences of Tiger and some other large hedge
funds may signal that the days are over when big ``macro'' funds _
betting on currencies and interest rates _ could profit by rattling
world markets. Globalization is rapidly curtailing market
inefficiencies that Tiger and other funds have been so adept at
exploiting.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger's problems began in October 1998, when the firm lost $2
billion in a single day after the backfiring of a bet on the price
of the Japanese yen relative to the dollar. Tiger has since largely
eliminated such macro moves. ``We decided primarily to return to
what brought us to the party,'' Robertson said _ referring to plain
old stock-picking.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson has bounced back from bad periods before _ making big
gains in 1996 and 1997, for instance, after two subpar years. But
even some current investors question whether he can recover this
time in similar fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Tiger going to be able to rebound the same as it did
then?'' asked one Tiger investor, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``I don't know. One would certainly hope so, but I'm not
sure anybody can say with certainty that it's going to happen
again.'' Succession, this investor added, ``is an issue for every
investor in any sort of investment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If Julian were to say, `I'm retiring tomorrow,' it would be an
issue, as well,'' the investor added.
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of Tiger's loyalists, terrible years are inevitable
for any great investor. They say that when Internet, technology and
large growth stocks eventually falter, Robertson's relative returns
will improve greatly. They see his problems largely as a result of
logical but untimely and unlucky bets, as well as of opportunistic
attacks by others hoping to profit from Tiger's travails.
</P>
<P>
   And they say the heavy redemptions show how one bad year can
make fickle investors forget how Tiger has beaten the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 stock index by an average of 11 percentage points a year
for nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Kenyon, chief executive of Union Bancaire Privee Asset
Management, the United States investment arm of a private Swiss
bank and a longtime Tiger investor, said Tiger's poor results were
``simply a case of a great value investor in a market that's not
value-oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We're in a fickle time for investors, where they
look at the paper every day and see someone has just made some
21,000 percent return on some Internet-related stock. It is the
most difficult market we've had in the last 25 years, a period in
which Julian has been an outstanding buyer of value.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE
</P>
<P>
   Lee S. Ainslie III, who left Tiger six years ago as a managing
director and is now managing partner of Maverick Capital, a Dallas
hedge fund, described his former boss as ``an extremely competitive
person with a great deal of pride.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe his primary motivation has not been economic,''
Ainslie said. ``It's been for reputation, and I'm sure he feels
it's awfully important that he work hard to restore his investors
back to the footing they expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson has gained a reputation for being tough on his
critics, an image that results in large part from a libel suit he
filed against Business Week after an unflattering cover article in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson dropped the suit a year later after the magazine,
which made no payment to Robertson, ran an editors' note saying its
predictions about Tiger's future performance were not borne out by
subsequent results, which included a 38 percent gain, after fees,
in 1996, and a 56 percent gain in 1997. Still, many people decline
to be identified as saying anything remotely critical of Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson concedes that part of the problem in the last year was
his own fault. ``During the golden years,'' he said, the firm got
too casual about its research, ``and did not really improve it the
way we always had in the past.'' Most notably, he said, the poor
stock-picking manifested itself in disastrous wrong-way bets on
technology stocks. That included selling some stocks short _
betting that they would fall by selling borrowed shares in hopes of
buying them back later for less.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had really lost an enormous amount of money in technology,
and that was primarily from being short,'' he said, noting that
some other short-sellers managed to do much better. ``Look, it has
been very disappointing. It is a big, horrible morale hurdle. No
winning team likes to lose, and that's just fact.''
</P>
<P>
   If the market turns in Tiger's favor, then ``we're geniuses,''
he said. ``But right now, we're dodos. That's just the way it
goes.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of North Carolina, Robertson spent much of his career
as a stockbroker and money manager at Kidder, Peabody. But in 1980,
he left and founded Tiger with $8 million in capital, taking a name
suggested by one of his young sons.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger's investments soared from the start, as the firm beat the
S&AMP;P 500 by at least 20 percentage points, after fees, in five of
its first six years. Through last December, Tiger had an average
gross return of 36 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   After subtracting the firm's cut of one-fifth of investment
profits, Robertson's original investors have booked an average
annual return of 29 percent _ far ahead of the 18 percent average
for the S&AMP;P 500 index. An investment of $100,000 when Tiger opened
in May 1980 would have been worth more than $11 million by last
year, compared with about $2.1 million for a similar investment in
the S&AMP;P 500 index.
</P>
<P>
   But beginning in the fall of 1998, Robertson seemed to step into
every pothole he had avoided during those 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   First was the October currency loss. Later in that year, Tiger
placed enormous bets against stocks in two hot sectors _
telecommunications equipment and technology. Tiger lost big
amounts, for example, short-selling shares of Lucent Technologies
and Micron Technology, said one person close to the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger now owns shares of both Lucent and Micron, this person
said, and it has invested heavily in some other technology stocks
this year, including Cisco Systems, Microsoft and Intel. Tiger
finished last year down 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson declined to comment on specific short sales, but he
acknowledged that Tiger officials had mistakenly made big bets
against some companies without being ``as aware of their close ties
to the Internet.'' Trying to sell short in this market, he said, is
like being ``run over by a train that's going to derail a mile down
the road.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Tiger has changed its opinion somewhat, Robertson is
highly skeptical of most Internet valuations and says the day will
come when money will bolt and flood into value stocks. ``The
Internet thing is just beyond belief,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, Robertson has hired a number of top analysts
in the technology, telecommunications and health care areas, most
notably Thomas Kurlak, a former Merrill Lynch semiconductor
analyst. Tiger now has the best analyst teams it has ever had to
research those sectors, Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   Some hires have been guaranteed sizable long-term pay packages
in part to make up for the effects of Tiger's ``high water mark''
clause in its contracts with investors. The clause states that the
firm cannot collect its 20 percent cut of profits until investors
first recoup the losses of the last year _ thus taking away a big
component of employee compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have spent a fortune on that, an absolute fortune,''
Robertson said. The new technology hires have already shown
results, he said, including a 62 percent return on a sub-portfolio
started with $200 million in March.
</P>
<P>
   But Robertson's main focus remains on value stocks, which
contributed greatly to Tiger's 22.5 percent loss this year through
November. ``Some of these companies are selling at literally five
and six times earnings and selling at two and three times cash
flow,'' he said. ``It's just wild.''
</P>
<P>
   In August, Robertson's frustration with his largest holding, a
22.4 percent stake in US Airways, prompted him to file a 13-D form
with the Securities and Exchange Commission indicating that he
might seek to have the airline sold. As to whether Tiger was
searching for a buyer for the airline, Robertson said only that
``we have done some work in that area.''
</P>
<P>
   But barring a buyer willing to pay a very large premium to the
airline's recent price of $30 a share, look for Robertson to hold
his shares. At Tiger's annual investor meeting in October, he
acknowledged that he had misjudged the outlook for US Airways. But
he noted that the company had repurchased about 30 percent of its
stock over the last 19 months, and he predicted it could generate
as much as $640 million in free cash flow in 2001 _ or about a
third of the company's current market value. ``We're not about to
sell our shares,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If the difficulties with currencies, technology short-selling
and value stocks were not enough, Tiger had another problem: As
part of reducing the amount of borrowed money it had invested and
raising cash for investor withdrawals, Tiger has unwound more than
$100 billion of its positions since October 1998. Its total
exposure _ stocks, short sales, currency and interest rate bets,
derivatives and other holdings _ has fallen to less than $25
billion, from $125 billion. That includes selling more than $40
billion worth of stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, a fire sale. Philip Duff, Tiger's chief
operating officer, said: ``How many financial institutions could
have a $100 billion downsizing of their balance sheet, or an 80
percent reduction? Few of those would probably survive.''
</P>
<P>
   The asset sales have given others on Wall Street a chance to
make easy money at Tiger's expense by selling their top holdings
short, with the knowledge that the firm would probably have to sell
big blocks to meet redemption demands or to stabilize its
portfolio. Other investors who owned those stocks also sold them,
fearing that they would lose value if Tiger dumped many shares.
</P>
<P>
   For Duff, confirmation of this effect came last June, after a
report that Tiger could face $3 billion in second-quarter
redemptions. (The real number was about $1 billion.) Within 15
minutes, he said, the computer generating Tiger's real-time
profit-and-loss statement showed that the firm had lost $72 million
while the overall market stayed flat.
</P>
<P>
   As the worry over Tiger reached a frenzy in late summer, short
positions in many of its big holdings soared. From August to
October, for example, the number of US Airways shares sold short
rose to 3.8 million from 1.6 million. Federal-Mogul, the auto parts
maker, saw total short sales leap from 3.7 million to 6.5 million
between September and October.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger's efforts to reduce the amounts it had borrowed to make
investments are now largely complete, and the heavy pace of
redemptions cannot continue indefinitely. Of the firm's $8.1
billion under management, about $2 billion is locked up for several
years, and another $2 billion is held by Robertson and other Tiger
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger had also considered limiting longtime investors to
redeeming shares only twice a year instead of quarterly, but
Robertson said he had since decided that beginning in January that
policy would apply only to new investments.
</P>
<P>
   The problems of the last year aside, uncertainty about who will
succeed Robertson is of great importance to Tiger investors and,
one former Tiger employee said, has contributed to decisions by
some valued analysts and traders to leave Tiger.
</P>
<P>
   The issue ``caused people to increasingly question or doubt''
their future role, this person said.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger's alumni include a number of rising industry stars, like
Ainslie and Lawrence Bowman of Bowman Capital Management in San
Mateo, Calif. Some of this year's departing traders have already
set up their own funds, including Andreas Halvorsen, a former
director of equities at Tiger who now runs Viking Global Investors
in New York. He declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Succession remains an open question, Robertson said, adding that
one reason he hired Duff, a former Morgan Stanley chief financial
officer, last year was to help map out succession as well as to
give the firm more structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all unfortunately aware of my age, and Phil is busily
addressing that as well as he can,'' Robertson said. ``It's a
little hard, psychologically, for me to be talking about death, but
on the other hand, it has to be thought about. Frankly, I don't
want to be doddering around here at age 90 running this
portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   One possibility, he said, could spring from the start earlier
this year of five subportfolios _ each run by a team of analysts
with minimal oversight by Robertson _ in technology,
telecommunications, health care, Japanese stocks and financial
stocks. Their performance could help identify people to promote,
Robertson said, but he does not rule out bringing in someone from
the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger is also considering starting sector hedge funds to invest
in specific industries like technology or telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger, which has about 100 employees, has lost one-fourth of
them this year _ including some who quit and some who were asked to
leave. But Robertson plays down any notion that either uncertainty
about the firm or his sometimes rough management style _ ``Look, I
have a temper,'' he acknowledged _ has created a brain drain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a history of losing people,'' he said, but ``as long
as you have a stream of good people coming through here, that
doesn't affect you in the least.'' Tiger has hired 15 analysts this
year, people there say.
</P>
<P>
   It is anybody's guess how long Robertson will remain at Tiger's
helm. But one longtime hedge fund consultant, Lee Hennessee, whose
family has known the Robertsons most of this century, noted that
Robertson's father kept going to work until he turned 94. ``Once
the dust settles,'' she said, ``I think he'll be just like his
father.''

WARNING ABOUT DANGERS OF BONFIRE CAME MONTHS BEFORE COLLAPSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ROSS E. MILLOY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Seven months before the Nov. 18 bonfire
accident that killed 12 people and injured 27 others at Texas A&AMP;M
University, a university vice president warned in a memorandum that
``we are dangerously close to having a serious incident that
connects alcohol, residence halls and bonfire,'' according to
documents released here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   J. Malon Southerland, the vice president for student affairs,
had issued the warning to colleagues on March 9 in response to a
series of problems reported to his office involving the bonfire, a
90-year-old tradition here, including alcohol abuse, hazing and
other injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The revelation was just one of many contained in nearly 3,000
documents, e-mail memorandums and photographs related to the
accident that were released this week by Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred as about 75 students were building a
bonfire as a part of the festivities surrounding the annual
football game against the university's archrival, the University of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The documents are expected to be part of the investigation
initiated by Texas A&AMP;M's president, Dr. Ray Bowen.
</P>
<P>
   Among the material was a police report about the 1998 bonfire
indicating that university officers discovered 30 students,
including 20 students who were underage, with a 15-gallon keg of
beer on the bonfire site. One of the underage students was found
unconscious and vomiting and had to be taken to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the students killed on Nov. 18 were legally drunk,
according to autopsy reports, and another student's blood showed
traces of alcohol. Evidence taken from the scene included empty
beer bottles and cans, bottlecaps, and at least one can of beer.
</P>
<P>
   But a new laboratory test has raised some doubt about claims
that two students were drunk, said a justice of the peace, George
Boyett.
</P>
<P>
   Boyett said that samples of fluids from the two victims had been
sent back for retesting and that those tests had different results.
He said an inquiry was under way.
</P>
<P>
   Southerland was not available for comment Friday after officials
issued a statement saying ``the university is taking the position
that its personnel will refrain from commenting on any aspect of
the inquiry or on any of the multitude of documents it has placed
on file for public review.''
</P>
<P>
   Leo E. Linbeck Jr., a Houston executive who is serving as
chairman of a five-person panel investigating the accident for the
university, said Friday that he did not believe that student
drinking or horseplay caused the log pile to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any sense that alcohol played a part in the
accident,'' Linbeck said, ``and we've had no evidence yet to
suggest that it did.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the investigation would examine questions raised about
the structural design, and any behavior by students or others that
might have contributed to the collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a massive job ahead of us, but if student drinking
was part of the problem, we'll indicate that in our report,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Linbeck, 65, a graduate of the University of Notre Dame,
compared the task of his commission to that of investigating the
crash of an airliner.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least with an air crash you know what the airplane looked
like and what it was supposed to do,'' Linbeck said. ``In this
case, we have to figure out what the design ambitions of the
bonfire were and whether or not it was built and performed to those
specifications.''
</P>
<P>
   Though university officials have a goal of March 31 for delivery
of the commission's report, Linbeck refused to be held to any
timetable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of aspects to this case, and we're going to
take all the time we need to come up with the answers,'' he said.
``We've already identified more than 70 key questions that need to
be answered, and we will answer them all before we're finished.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Dallas Morning News reported that the bonfire
was 4 feet higher than a 55-foot height limitation imposed in 1968
when a bonfire also collapsed, and that the final structure would
have risen higher than 70 feet when completed.
</P>
<P>
   Other reports have pointed out various violations of the
university's ``Bonfire Safety Handbook,'' including underclassmen
working in the upper reaches of the stack reserved for more
experienced participants.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An evaluation of the 1998 bonfire also contained in the
documents indicated that university officials had raised questions
about the safety procedures surrounding the bonfires. The
evaluation listed 34 injuries involving ax cuts, machete cuts,
abrasions, broken bones and multiple lacerations that required
hospital treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ben Welch, director of student activities at Texas A&AMP;M, was
the university official who received the police report on the 1998
bonfire. At the time of last month's accident, Welch was in the
midst of resolving hazing accusations surrounding this year's
bonfire activities.
</P>
<P>
   Two residence halls on campus, Crocker House and Walton House,
had been prohibited from participating in building the bonfire
because of complaints that their members had been involved in the
hazing of underclassmen.
</P>
<P>
   At least one bonfire ``yellowpot'' (a term for crew leaders on
the stack) was removed from his position on Nov. 10 and was
appealing his suspension at the time of the accident, according to
the documents.
</P>
<P>
   The documents gave no details about the type of hazing involved.
</P>
<P>
   Southerland's memo warning of potential problems involving the
bonfire and student drinking apparently prompted a meeting of
senior university staff on April 29.
</P>
<P>
   The official who called the meeting, Ron Sasser, director of
residence life for the university, summarized the discussions by
writing to his colleagues that ``these problems did not occur
overnight and will take time to significantly improve. Many
questions arose about whether they could ever be totally
resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote: ``It should be recognized that alcohol, bonfire,
traditions, hazing issues are very interwoven, in many cases are
difficult to seperate (sic). This again emphasizes the need for a
universitywide effort if the problems are to be resolved.''

SPORTS COLUMN: END OF AN ERA IN SOUTH BEND 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an attempt to put the outgoing century in perspective, we
have been bombarded by lists and rankings: the most powerful, the
most influential, the best. But the moment that provides the
greatest symmetry of this sports century unfolded Friday in South
Bend, Ind., when the NC AA placed Notre Dame on probation for two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame on probation. Who would have guessed? Certainly not
Grantland Rice, the legendary sportswriter of the first half of
this century. Rice's account of the 1924 Notre Dame-Army game
contains one of the classic leads in sports journalism: ``Outlined
against a blue-gray October sky, the Four Horsemen rode again. In
dramatic lore they are known as Famine, Pestilence, Destruction and
Death. These are only aliases. Their real names are Stuhldreher,
Miller, Crowley and Layden.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus Notre Dame football, now with its Four Horsemen, went from
popular to legendary. Of all the college sports teams in the 20th
century, Notre Dame became the most significant; the Fighting Irish
invented big-time college sports. Now the century ends with them on
probation.
</P>
<P>
   The penalties themselves were less than a slap on the wrist. The
sanctions will not bar Notre Dame from bowl games and will not
affect the school's exclusive television contract with NBC. The
program loses one scholarship _ out of 85 _ for each year of
probation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Notre Dame has all these walk-ons who are offered athletic
scholarships at other schools,'' said Murray Sperber, a professor
of English and American Studies at Indiana University. ``They
watched the movie `Rudy' one too many times and they hope to make
the Notre Dame roster, so these sanctions are not going to hurt
them remotely. I think they're embarrassed by the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sperber has written three books about intercollegiate athletics.
In 1990 he published ``College Sports Inc.: The Athletic Department
vs. the University'' (Henry Holt). Five years later he wrote
``Shake Down the Thunder: The Creation of Notre Dame Football''
(Henry Holt, 1995).
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me understand them more,'' he said. ``People on the
outside have lots of myths about Notre Dame. A lot of people think
it's this huge school because they play Michigan, but its a very
small school. They think of the people there as being very
arrogant, whereas I found them to be very polite and professional.
I came to appreciate them in a professional sense, and I became
friendly with one or two people there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never be a Notre Dame fan,' he added. ``I went to Purdue,
after all. But it made me understand them more. I'll say this:
Athletes there get a better education than at a lot of other
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still believe somehow in the student-athletes thing, and
I think they are trying harder to do it and as a result they are
not able to compete in recruiting with Florida State.''
</P>
<P>
   Sperber, who at his core is a cynic, has nonetheless been
seduced by the aura and legend of Notre Dame football and has
failed to distinguish the university from the football program. In
a football sense, how different is Notre Dame from Florida State?
</P>
<P>
   The story of Notre Dame football _ indeed, of all the great
college football programs _ is largely the story of image and
imagery _ and stones left unturned.
</P>
<P>
   The Notre Dame violations stem from the activity of a a
bookkeeper turned booster who embezzled more than $1.2 million from
a former employer and used some of the money to lavish gifts and
trips on at least a dozen Notre Dame players.
</P>
<P>
   The bookkeeper, Kimberly Dunbar, was convicted of embezzlement
in September 1998 and was sentenced to four years in prison. She
was released in October after serving one year.
</P>
<P>
   Sperber conceded, ``You could say the Notre Dame coaches could
have been more into their players' lives.''
</P>
<P>
   School officials reacted as much to the tarnish caused by the
event as they did to the actual event.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a good day for Notre Dame,'' the Rev. Edward
Malloy, the school's president, said. ``We are embarrassed by these
incidents, troubled that they occurred and have taken action to
avoid such problems in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   There probably won't be another invention like Notre Dame
football in the future, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot imagine any college team in the 21st century
representing what the Notre Dame Fighting Irish did in this
century,'' Sperber said.
</P>
<P>
   Unless another Grantland Rice dreams one up.

FRANCE WORRIES THAT U.S. MAY BECOME A BULLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France, on a visit to
Tokyo, said Friday that the United States should be ``discreet'' in
exercising its global power.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin, a Socialist, also made veiled criticisms of the United
States in a speech in Tokyo on Thursday that were more pointed than
remarks made by President Jacques Chirac, a Gaullist conservative,
in an interview this week.
</P>
<P>
   Both leaders chided Congress for sharply cutting the $370
million the Clinton administration had asked for to ease the debts
of 41 poor countries, mostly in Africa, as President Clinton and
other leaders agreed at a summit meeting in Germany this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resistance of the American Congress on this point is
worrisome,'' Jospin told his audience in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac said: ``Congress has recently made the participation of
the World Bank more difficult. It's hard to tell why. It's not a
very large amount of money, and we can settle it without the World
Bank, or more precisely the World Bank will find the funds
elsewhere. So why did Congress do this?''
</P>
<P>
   Jospin also seemed to blame U.S. negotiators for the collapse of
the opening of a new round of world trade talks in Seattle early
this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain countries that chose to give priority to their
domestic policy goals came with an intransigent attitude and
refused to enter into real negotiations,'' he said. ``That should
reinforce our determination to counter any temptation to return to
unilateralism.''
</P>
<P>
   In French political discourse, ``unilateralism'' is a uniquely
American sin.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin said France, which will hold the rotating presidency of
the European Union in the second half of next year, wanted to hold
a high-level meeting of member countries in the World Trade
Organization to draw lessons from Seattle and make it ``more
effective, more open and more democratic.''
</P>
<P>
   He also took a dig at the United States for failing to pay all
its dues to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``All member states should fulfill their financial
obligations,'' he said. ``France and Japan do that completely and
unconditionally. A responsible attitude by all contributor nations
would encourage the necessary reforms of the organization,
including the Security Council.''

ELSEWHERE, 1999 IS SHAPING UP AS A BANNER YEAR

<P>
   Tiger Management's woes notwithstanding, many hedge funds have
been posting their highest returns in years, buoyed by soaring
international markets and what some managers say may be the best
environment for stock-picking since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Top-performing funds include those specializing in technology
stocks, the Pacific Rim, Latin America and emerging markets in
general. Over all, an index of hedge funds tracked by Hennessee
Hedge Fund Advisory has gained 23.17 percent this year through
November, putting it on a pace to beat the S&AMP;P 500 _ which rose
14.3 percent through November _ by the widest margin in six years.
</P>
<P>
   The results are a stunning reversal from last year, when many
hedge funds _ battered by the Russian debt default, bad bets on the
Japanese yen and fallout from the near-collapse of Long-Term
Capital Management _ trailed the S&AMP;P by wide margins.
</P>
<P>
   Carrie McCabe, chief executive of Blackstone Alternative Asset
Management, which oversees $1.5 billion in hedge-fund assets, said
some of the managers with the best performance are those investing
in European stocks, or selling them short.
</P>
<P>
   Profits on the short side have come much more easily in Europe,
she said, as national economies continue to integrate and
industries that had enjoyed the fruits of protectionism falter
against new competition.
</P>
<P>
   Among technology fund managers, the best performers are those
who have switched nimbly among different parts of the industry,
like software and hard drives. ``There were a huge number of sector
rotations this year,'' Ms. McCabe said.
</P>
<P>
   Laggards this year include so-called macro funds _ which use
currency and interest-rate bets to profit from global trends _ and
some that specialize in value stocks, which typically trade at
lower price-to-earnings ratios.
</P>
<P>
   George Soros' Quantum fund, which like Tiger is one of the
biggest hedge funds, fared poorly for much of this year. But it
soared last month on the strength of its technology holdings,
giving it a 14.6 percent gain for the year through Dec. 15, people
at the firm said.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Ask Jeeves Sued Over Patents  &HT;     By Kelly Zito 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Two scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are
suing Ask Jeeves, a company that lets Web surfers use everyday
English to conduct Web searches, for patent infringement.
<P>
   Emeryville's Ask Jeeves, which operates the popular Ask.com
site, violates two U.S. patents issued in 1994 and 1995, according
to artificial intelligence researchers Patrick Winston and Boris
Katz.
</P>
<P>
   The patents concern methods for retrieving stored text and
database material using so-called ``natural-language'' searches
such as ``What city is nicknamed `The Big Apple?''' or ``Where can
I find MP3 players?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically we have two patents and we filed a suit for patent
infringement,'' Katz said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Katz wouldn't elaborate on the details of the suit, but
according to his Web page, for the past several years he has been
developing the ``START natural language system that allows the user
to access various types of information using English.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz is a research scientist at MIT's Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory. Winston is the Ford professor of Artificial
Intelligence and Computer Science at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Ask Jeeves said the company hadn't yet &LR;   &LR; been
served with official notice of the suit but said it is ``without
merit'' and the company plans to aggressively defend itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they describe in their patents is fundamentally different
from what we do,'' said company spokeswoman Heather Staples.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint, filed yesterday in federal court in Boston, seeks
an injunction prohibiting Ask Jeeves from ``making, using or
selling the Internet search products provided under AskJeeves.com,
Ask.com and Ajkids.com,'' according to a statement from Katz and
Winston.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also seeks to prevent Ask Jeeves from licensing its
search software to other companies and asks for treble damages for
``willful infringement'' of the two patents.
</P>
<P>
   Along with operating the Ask.com site, Ask Jeeves provides its
search technology to sites for companies like Nike, Microsoft and
Williams-Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   At www.marthastewart.com, for instance, the technology allows
brides-to-be to ask plain English questions like ``How much should
I pay for my wedding?'' and receive instant answers.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time this year publicly traded Ask Jeeves has
been sued.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Mountain View's IPLearn LLC filed a suit in federal
court in Oakland, also alleging patent infringement. Ask Jeeves
denied it violated a patent held by that company. That case is
still pending.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Jeeves stock fell $7.36 yesterday, closing at $118.50.

BUSH SAYS IF THERE WERE POCKETS OF HUNGER IN TEXAS, HE'D KNOW ABOUT
IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Gov. George W. Bush challenged a recent federal report
on Friday, saying that many Texans, including children, are going
to bed hungry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the report that children in Texas are going hungry.
Where?'' Bush said in an interview with the Star-Telegram. ``I want
to know the facts. I would like for the Department of Agriculture
to show us who. Where are they, and we'll respond.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No children are going to go hungry in this state,'' declared
Bush, whose ``leave no child behind'' slogan has become a theme of
his frontrunning presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll fix it and respond,'' he added. ``You'd think the
governor would have heard if there are pockets of hunger in
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Anti-hunger activists and food pantry workers were startled at
Bush's statements, saying emergency food distribution has risen
sharply in Texas as soup kitchens strain to meet demand.
</P>
<P>
   `I'm shocked he said that,'' said Sharon Hogan, executive
director of the Metroplex Food Bank in Fort Worth, which
distributes food to the needy and to food pantries. ``There are
massive amounts of people who go hungry. I could you give you story
after story.''
</P>
<P>
   On a bulletin board inside her office is a photo of a 7-year-old
boy who lost most of his teeth from malnutrition, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I'll get to work at 6:30 a.m. and find people in the
parking lot waiting for food that we don't distribute until 1
p.m.,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The federal study that Bush challenged, a U.S. Department of
Agriculture report entitled ``Measuring Food Security in the United
States,'' says about 13 percent of Texas households were ``food
insecure,'' or unable to meet basic food needs at all times,
between 1996 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   About 5 percent of Texas households suffered from hunger during
the period, a rate surpassed only by Oregon. The study defines
hunger as insufficient food intake causing an uneasy or painful
sensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a new report saying there's hungry kids in Texas.
It's been true for years,'' said Celia Hagert, nutrition policy
analyst at the Center for Public Policy Priorities, an advocacy
group for low-income Texans. ``It's ludicrous to say there's no
hungry people in Texas. It's just ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the report was carefully conducted using a detailed
questionnaire. Bush, however, suggested that Texans who need food
assistance are already receiving it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got food banks,'' the Republican governor said. ``We've
got food stamps. You know there's a lot of people that are poor
people, but I'd like to know who's going hungry in the state of
Texas. That report just kind of flew out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Janet Cocciarelli, director of the Texas Association of Second
Harvest Food Banks, a non-profit which distributes food to hunger
relief agencies, said a steady increase in demand for food aid
indicates there are hungry Texans, children and adults alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are definitely hungry children in Texas,'' she said.
Distribution projections for 1999 show the organization will
distribute 120 million pounds of food to 19 Texas food banks, a 26
percent increase over 1996, when welfare reforms took effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're finding within the food banking industry is we are
not able to keep up with the increased demands on our member
agencies,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Molly Beth Malcolm, the state Democratic party chair, accused
Bush of living in a ``land of illusions'' and repeated criticism of
his 1995 veto of a unanimously passed bill that would have created
a volunteer Food Security Council to study the hunger problem and
help acquire hunger grant money.
</P>
<P>
   In his veto proclamation, Bush said he rejected the bill because
it was ``not in the state's best interest to create another
bureaucratic entity ... when a private organization could be more
effective.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are children probably within a mile or two of his
Governor's Mansion that are hungry,'' Malcolm said. ``Every member
of the Legislature acknowledged that there were hungry people in
this state when they passed that hunger bill four years ago. Bush
refused to face reality then, and he's refusing to face reality
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush made his comments as he prepares for the GOP presidential
primaries, which begin next month. On Friday, surrounded by his
fellow Republican statewide elected officials, the governor filed
the paperwork to appear on the ballot in Texas on March 14.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, in a news conference and, later, in an interview with
the Star-Telegram, Bush:
</P>
<P>
   Said that Texas, facing potentially drastic measures to clean up
its dirty air, was right to pull the plug in 1995 on a politically
unpopular tailpipe testing program. The state later had to pay the
contractor, Tejas Testing Technology, $140 million for canceling
the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so sure of your premise that the air would have been
cleaner if we had centralized testing in the Metroplex or Harris
County,'' Bush told a reporter. ``I think that was an assumption
that just wasn't valid.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Vice President Al Gore, potentially his White House rival,
is proposing to usurp the states' traditional role in overseeing
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Al Gore wants to do is to run for federal superintendent
of schools,'' Bush said. ``The state's role is to build buildings
and the state's role is to pay teachers more. The federal role, to
the extent that it's focusing on children, needs to demand for
results and standards and high accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush criticized Gore's proposal to provide universal pre-school,
saying the government already has a sufficient pre-school program _
Head Start, essentially a pre-school program for poor children:
``We've got a pre-school _ called Head Start,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Said that European demands to require labeling of U.S. beef
produced with hormones, or of genetically altered foods, reflects a
desire to ``smear U.S. products.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I sense they want to run a propaganda campaign,'' he said.
``There needs to be scientific labels as to whether something is
safe or not. What I'm for is for there to be truth in advertising
that enables a product manufacturer to clearly state nothing in
this product is harmful to your health, for example.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday
ordered 392 plants in a dozen states, mostly electric generating
stations, to cut in half emissions of chemicals that drift with
winds and add to smog along the Eastern seaboard.
</P>
<P>
   The federal regulators acted at the request of New York,
Connecticut, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, which said they needed
help to meet national smog standards.
</P>
<P>
   The plants are in 12 states, as far west as Indiana and as far
south as North Carolina. Agency officials said they might soon
issue similar orders for plants in Illinois. Most of the plants
meet existing federal limits on the chemicals, nitrogen oxides, and
are in areas that do not exceed smog standards.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 states are West Virginia, Ohio, North Carolina,
Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Michigan, New Jersey, Kentucky,
Delaware, New York and Indiana. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The states that requested the action are among a group on the
East Coast that had already agreed among themselves to impose the
stricter standard on nitrogen oxide emissions within their borders.
The areas that would for the first time be forced to take action
under Friday's order are in the South and Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   The areas covered by the action must reduce emissions by a total
of about half a million tons a year, all in the summer smog season,
the federal regulators said. The EPA said that compliance would
cost companies, which include Ford, General Motors, Dow Chemical
and most power providers in Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania,
about $950 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in several industries, though, said Friday that they
were not sure what compliance would cost. Many executives and state
officials from areas covered by the order denounced it, saying that
they already met strict standards, that Eastern smog was little
affected by Midwestern emissions and that the EPA would ultimately
be rebuffed by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA's track record in court has been poor in the last few
months. In May, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit barred the agency from enforcing a stricter
standard on smog levels, one calculated over an eight-hour period
instead of the current one-hour. In a separate decision, it blocked
the EPA from requiring the states to order a new round of
reductions in nitrogen oxide emissions from sources within their
borders.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Browner said Friday in a conference call with reporters,
``Our commitment is to solve the long-distance ozone-transport
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get there, one way or the other,'' she said.
``We are going to get there. We are going to get people clean
air.''

 &HT;    Battle lines firm in affirmative action fight
 &HT;    By Stephen Kiehl
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Ward Connerly brought his
anti-affirmative action campaign to West Palm Beach on Friday,
sending a message to Gov. Jeb Bush: You cannot stop me, no matter
how many roadblocks you put in my way.
</P>
<P>
   The latest delay, at the state Supreme Court, could make it
impossible for Connerly to put his racial preferences referendum to
voters next fall. Last week, the Californian put his petition drive
on hold until the court rules, which may not be until next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly and his supporters said Friday they had slowed but not
stopped their drive, and they will continue to gather signatures to
be in a position to get their measure on the ballot if the court
rules in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no intention of backing off,'' Connerly told 340 people
at the Sheraton West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly's Florida Civil Rights Initiative has gathered more
than 50,000 signatures and needs to get another 385,000 by Aug. 8
to get on the ballot. The initiative has been opposed by both
Democratic and Republican lawmakers, but polls show it would win
easy approval from voters.
</P>
<P>
   In his talk, hosted by the Forum Club of the Palm Beaches,
Connerly mixed praise with criticism of Bush's One Florida plan,
designed to derail Connerly. He also blasted the state's
complicated method for getting a referendum on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, about 25 protesters from the National Organization
for Women waved signs _ ``Ward Off Connerly,'' said one _ and
passed out pro-affirmative action literature to people attending
the speech.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly, accustomed to hostile opposition, jokingly said that
he appreciated the welcome brigade but didn't understand the
one-fingered salute.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the hotel, the reception was warmer, with bursts of
applause throughout the speech, but Connerly still faced angry
questions from small-business owners and politicians, including
Palm Beach County Commission Chairwoman Maude Ford Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are zero programs in place, nothing is going to
happen'' to help minority contractors, Lee said. Connerly responded
that preferences based on race ignore discrimination against other
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe racism is gone,'' Connerly said. ``There's all
forms of discrimination. Nobody has a monopoly on discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   A member of California's Board of Regents, Connerly was
instrumental in putting measures before California and Washington
voters that ended affirmative action in those states. He made
Florida his next battleground, he said, because of its size and his
desire to make race preferences an issue in the 2000 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   To those who say he should stay out of Florida's business,
Connerly offered no apologies, saying, ``55 percent of my taxes go
to government agencies, some of which are in Florida, and that
entitles me to go anyplace and share my views.''
</P>
<P>
   Connerly said Bush's One Florida plan is a good effort but it
doesn't go far enough. The plan ends racial preference in state
contracting and university admissions, but guarantees the top 20
percent of students at every public high school entry to a state
university.
</P>
<P>
   While ending explicit racial preferences, the Bush plan allows
colleges to look at race-correlated factors _ such as the economic
status and hometowns of applicants _ when admitting students.
Connerly said that distinction is really no distinction at all.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly also said the ``Talented 20'' guarantee will lower the
quality of students who get into college, hurting the reputation of
state universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida is not in the top tier of academic institutions, yet
you want to be,'' Connerly told the editorial board of The Palm
Beach Post. ``I don't know how you can get there by admitting the
top 20 percent of all high school students.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Bush responded that the governor believes his
plan will eventually improve the caliber of college students
because of the plan's provisions for improving high schools.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly was unequivocal in his call for a colorblind society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black people have to give up the past,'' he said. ``Slavery is
gone _ it's history. ... Our destiny is to get beyond that.''

 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Banco Bradesco is among the biggest and most
solemn of Brazil's banks, with the motto ``Only work can produce
wealth'' chiseled into the entrance of its headquarters in a suburb
of this city. Bradesco is also one of the hottest stocks at the
center of Brazil's Internet stock frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Bradesco's efforts to strengthen its online banking
operations, the bank is one of a handful of companies listed on the
Sao Paulo stock exchange that investors have chosen as a way to bet
on the growth of the Internet in Latin America's largest economy.
</P>
<P>
   Recent gains in these stocks have helped push the benchmark
Bovespa index up more than 100 percent this year, ranking Sao Paulo
among the world's best-performing markets. In dollar terms, the
Bovespa has gained more than 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While American investors have grown accustomed to the Internet
phenomenon on the record-breaking Nasdaq, it is a relatively new
trend in Brazil, where the stock market has been dominated by
telephone companies and electric utilities. The rush to make
Internet investments here is also made a bit stranger by the fact
that almost none of the companies singled out as investments are
Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Charles Schwab effect,'' said Roque Sut Ribeiro, a
fund manager at Sintese, a Sao Paulo brokerage firm. ``When people
saw that Charles Schwab's move into online trading made it worth
more than Merrill Lynch, it was clear that a stock with a coherent
Internet strategy could be in the same league as an Internet
company itself.''
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, this redrawing of the way in which companies in more
traditional businesses are viewed means that previously unknown
companies have become big hits among investors.
</P>
<P>
   Pao de Acucar, for instance, a supermarket chain, has climbed
183 percent this year after investors became enamored of the
company's efforts to sell groceries over the Internet. Livraria
Saraiva, a bookseller, is up 114 percent on optimism over plans to
mimic Amazon.com's model of selling books online.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is perhaps Bradesco that best typifies this trend.
Bradesco inaugurated Brazil's first commercial Web site in early
1995. Since then the bank, the largest financial institution in
Brazil that is not controlled by the central government, has sought
to draw clients to its site by offering services to pay bills
online, for instance, or trade securities.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Bradesco made its biggest splash by announcing that
it would offer free Internet access to account holders, who now
number 8.4 million. Although the announcement rattled Brazilian
Internet service providers, which are engaged in a price war to
attract customers, investors greeted the strategy by pushing up
Bradesco's shares 13 percent in two days. So far this year,
Bradesco has climbed 111 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing stuff that even American banks haven't thought
of,'' said Odecio Gregio, chief of technology at the bank. Gregio,
a white-haired banker with a penchant for dark suits, cited a
Bradesco service allowing people to communicate with the bank over
the Internet by using the latest generation of voice-recognition
software.
</P>
<P>
   Though investors are impressed with the Internet efforts of
companies like Bradesco, they acknowledge that such online forays
have yet to translate into significant revenue or profit increases.
Francisco Chevez, for example, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney
who covers Pao de Acucar, said the supermarket chain's Internet
sales had yet to account for 1 percent of total revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, ``It is the hybrid feature of a company like Pao de
Acucar which combines online sales with the bricks and mortar
needed as infrastructure that makes it an interesting Internet
play,'' Chevez said. ``The Internet in Latin America is still
largely about potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Projections of Internet growth in Brazil have helped the
performance of shares in Globo Cabo SA, perhaps the only stock on
the Sao Paulo exchange that can actually be classified as an
Internet company. After the Microsoft Corp. acquired a minority
stake in Globo Cabo earlier this year, the company announced plans
to offer Internet access over its network of underground cable
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Though other companies have similar plans, including Universo
Online, Brazil's largest Internet service provider, none are
publicly traded on local stock exchanges. So, attention has been
focused on Globo Cabo, even though investors were concerned just
earlier this year over the stalled growth of its client base after
the devaluation of the Brazilian real. In 1999, Globo Cabo is up
473 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is certain that the Internet craze will continue to
translate into impressive gains on the Sao Paulo market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil is nowhere near having a dynamic middle class that
could be targeted over the Internet because income is still
concentrated in the hands of an elite in most parts of the
country,'' said Pedro Guimaraes, an analyst at Banco Bozano,
Simonsen, in Rio de Janeiro. ``When the initial optimism over the
Internet dies down, the valuations of these companies could go
down.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki and legislative leaders from
both major parties agreed Friday to raise the state's cigarette tax
by 55 cents a pack in an ambitious effort to provide health care
coverage for as many as one million uninsured New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki and leaders of the Legislature also decided to renew a
financial program that pays hospitals about $1.3 billion a year to
train new doctors and treat poor people who show up in emergency
rooms with no way of paying their medical bills. The program had
been set to expire at the end of the year, threatening the state's
health care system with financial uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   The plan to expand coverage for the uninsured is expected to
cost the state about $750 million over the next 3 1-2 years. It
would be financed with revenue from the higher cigarette tax, as
well as a share of the $450 million a year that the state is to
receive from the settlement of the national lawsuit against tobacco
companies. The plan would also be paid for with about $300 million
in new federal health care funds.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement represents one of the most ambitious investments
in health care by the state in recent memory. It also concludes a
series of tense talks between Pataki, a Republican, and the
Democratic speaker of the Assembly, Sheldon Silver, over how to
finance the state's multibillion-dollar health care industry and
provide coverage for the growing number of medically uninsured New
Yorkers, who now number more than 3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would bring New York's tobacco tax to $1.11 a pack, the
highest of any state, and represents the first significant defeat
here for the tobacco industry since 1993. The industry has long
been one of the most powerful interest groups in state politics,
but recent disclosures about its extravagant spending on gifts for
lawmakers and other lobbying expenditures have weakened its
position. Some lawmakers acknowledge that they hope to use the
higher tax to rebuff charges that they are too close to the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations were largely orchestrated by Dennis Rivera, the
influential head of 1199, the National Health and Human Service
Employees Union, which represents 150,000 health care workers in
the state. Rivera had threatened to use his group's political clout
and financial resources to mount a fierce media campaign against
Pataki and his Republican allies in the Legislature if they moved
to reduce state financing for hospitals or refused to expand
medical coverage for the uninsured. He enlisted the support of not
only Democrats but Republicans as well, primarily Joseph Bruno, the
State Senate majority leader. Bruno shared the governor's concerns
over the state's rising health care costs, but also did not want to
pick a fight with labor unions over the issue. with an important
election year approaching.
</P>
<P>
   Before the deal was reached, the negotiations had stalled over
the question of how to structure the new insurance program.
Democrats had proposed modeling it after the Medicaid program, with
the state providing coverage directly to the uninsured using
federal and state funds. But Pataki was concerned that such an
approach would encourage employers to stop offering their workers
medical insurance and instead let the state and federal governments
provide it. He wanted to offer financial incentives for private
employers to expand coverage for workers.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the two sides agreed on a compromise that attempts
to accomplish both of their goals over the next 3 1-2years. The
agreement calls for providing free insurance to families earning up
to 150 percent of the federal poverty line _ meaning that a family
of four with an annual income of $25,000 or less could receive
coverage without paying premiums. The program would cost nearly
$600 million in state and federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for providing $219 million in state subsidies to
small businesses to help them provide medical coverage to their
employees. The money would be given to businesses with up to 50
employees. The agreement also sets aside $150 million to help
individuals buy their own medical coverage from private insurance
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said he expected as many as 500,000 uninsured New Yorkers
to apply for medical coverage over the next 3 1-2 years as a result
of the new health care initiative. ``I am confident that with this
program, we are going to have the best health care in the country,
possibly the world,'' the governor said during an afternoon news
conference at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also includes a major concession to Pataki: it keeps a
lid on the state's fast-growing Medicaid costs. Pataki has proposed
cuts in Medicaid spending in the past, only to be rebuffed by his
Democratic rivals nearly every year. But the deal announced Friday
would reauthorize a series of Medicaid cuts that are due to expire
on April 1. Those cuts total $1 billion a year in federal, state
and local financing for the Medicaid program, and the deal would
extend them for three years.

 ART- 2NDTAKE-NYT  
 ALBANY , N.Y. : three years. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The additional tobacco tax is expected to raise about $400
million a year for the state. The last increase in the state's
cigarette tax came in 1993, when it climbed to 56 cents a pack,
from 39 cents. At the time, that was the highest rate in the
country, but 13 other states have since adopted higher rates. New
Jersey's cigarette tax is 80 cents a pack, Connecticut's is 50
cents and Pennsylvania's is 31 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The measure marks the first time that Pataki has championed a
major tax increase since taking office in 1995 on an aggressive
tax-cutting platform. The tax increase could help him deflect
criticism over the fact that Philip Morris, the tobacco giant,
helped pay for two trips that he and his family took to Hungary in
1995 and 1996, an issue that is now the subject of a state ethics
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The move was lauded by anti-tobacco groups, which have long
asserted that a higher tax would discourage people, particularly
teen-agers, from smoking and lead others to quit. ``The 55-cent
cigarette tax hike could move New York to the front of the pack
nationally in tackling the tobacco menace,'' said Blair Horner, the
legislative director for the New York Public Interest Research
Group, a staunch advocate of policies discouraging tobacco use.
</P>
<P>
   But the measure drew protests from the tobacco industry, where
executives have long opposed tax increases, saying they depress
sales perhaps more than any other tobacco restriction. The industry
also says that such a tax is regressive, hitting the poorest
consumers the hardest, and that it encourages the smuggling of
cigarettes from states with lower taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan McCormick, spokesman for Philip Morris USA, said: ``We
think that it's a bad idea for New York state. The state's coffers
are really full of money in terms of the budget surplus. At a time
when the state's budget is prospering, we think that it's unfair to
single out smokers to pay for increased spending.'' He added, ``At
the same time, there is the potential for a negative business
impact on retailers, especially those located in border areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations between Pataki and Democratic leaders focused
on another critical health care issue: a state law that adds $1.7
billion in surcharges to hospital bills to help finance a range of
services provided by hospitals, primarily training young doctors
and providing charity care for the poor. The law, known as the
Health Care Reform Act, is set to expire at the end of the year,
and Pataki and the Democrats have been divided over what changes,
if any, to make to it before renewing it.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's allies in the business sector had been urging him to
eliminate the surcharges altogether, contending that employers end
up paying most of them through higher insurance premiums for their
workers. But Pataki abandoned their cause after they failed to
respond to an expensive advertising campaign that 1199 unveiled in
recent weeks predicting chaos if the surcharges were not preserved.
</P>
<P>
   Before Pataki and Democratic leaders reached an agreement on
renewing the system of surcharges, the negotiations had stalled on
the key question of how much money the state should be providing to
help hospitals train young doctors and provide charity care to the
poor. The issue is of great importance in New York City, where
large numbers of teaching hospitals provide care in poor
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's aides had privately proposed cutting funds for graduate
medical education, saying that the state should not be spending
money to train medical students because they often end up
practicing medicine in other states. The Democrats, meanwhile,
called for increasing the amount of money the state funnels to
hospitals to help treat poor people.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Pataki and Democratic leaders agreed to cut
financing for graduate medical education by $50 million a year, to
$494 million from $544 million. The two sides also agreed to
increase financing for charity care by $100 million a year, to $838
million from $738 million. The leaders also agreed to preserve a
program that provides health insurance for 415,000 low-income
children. That program, called Child Health Plus, is financed
through the system of hospital surcharges at a cost of $200 million
a year.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASSAIC, N.J. _ Ralph Briggs was helping his son Sean with his
seventh-grade vocabulary homework on Tuesday, when he asked the boy
to use the word ``cardinal'' in a sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Sean replied: ``The cardinal rule in our school is that you
don't shoot the teachers. If you have to shoot a gun, shoot it at
another student or an administrator.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I got very furious with my son,'' said Briggs, a deputy fire
chief in Hackensack. ``I said: `How can you say such a thing? You
know that's not right.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `That's what it says in our book.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sean had been quoting almost verbatim from ``Word Smart II,''
the Princeton Review study guide that he and his classmates had
been given at Collegiate Academy, a private school here, to prepare
for the preliminary College Board exams.
</P>
<P>
   Leafing through the guide, which aims to build vocabulary by
using words in sentences, Briggs found some other surprising uses
for words, like ``boorish'' (`` `Don't be boorish,' Sue admonished
Charles at the prom after he . . . crushed empty beer cans on his
head'') and ``byzantine'' (``Angela couldn't follow the novel's
byzantine plot, so she just read the dirty parts'') and
``inundated'' (``The 15-year-old was inundated with gifts after she
gave birth to octuplets'').
</P>
<P>
   Outraged by those and other passages, Briggs immediately
complained to school officials, who in turn complained to the
publisher of the books, Random House.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, in response, Random House officials decided to stop
shipment of the popular study guide and some other Princeton Review
guides, and said that they would review their other guides for what
they agreed was unsuitable material for students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We deeply regret this very insensitive use of language,'' Lisa
Alpert, vice president and publisher at Random House, said in a
statement. ``It is certainly not a reflection of the beliefs of
Random House or its Princeton Review publishing program.''
</P>
<P>
   Collegiate Academy officials said that they had pulled two of
the guides _ ``Word Smart I'' as well as its successor _ from
classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a conscious effort to denigrate all things that are
traditional and proper and family-oriented,'' said Angela Gibson,
schoolmistress at Collegiate. ``It shows no respect for rules and
order.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Applebaum, a spokesman for Random House, said the
Princeton Review books had a reputation for being more flippant
than other guides.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're beloved by students and some educators, professors and
administrators exactly for that _ their irreverence _ because they
speak to kids in a tongue-in-cheek, anti-authoritarian frame of
reference,'' he said. ``One would speculate that that was the frame
of mind of the authors, which maybe in 1992 was considered
amusing.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was quick to add that since then, events like school
shootings had lent a more sinister tone to sample sentences like
this one from ``Word Smart II'': ``The fraternal feeling among the
meeting participants disappeared when one of them stood up at
dinner and began firing a machine gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Applebaum said, ``Surely today, with all we've gone through in
this country, it's at the very least inappropriate and
insensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is the first time the company has had such
complaints about the guides, Applebaum said. ``Word Smart I'' was
first published in 1988 and revised in 1993. ``Word Smart II'' was
first published in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The series is mostly sold in bookstores to individual buyers,
most of whom are older than seventh-graders, he said. Some books
are sold to schools, although Applebaum said he did not know how
many. This year 16,000 copies of ``Word Smart II'' have been sold,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gibson said the Collegiate Academy, which has 150 students
from prekindergarten through 12th grade, sends 100 percent of its
students to college. To help them qualify for special programs for
gifted children at Johns Hopkins University, or Drew University,
she said, it begins preparing students as early as seventh grade to
take the College Board tests.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, Mrs. Gibson said, the school used other study
guides. This year, at the recommendation of an English teacher who
is no longer at the school, teachers began using ``Word Smart I''
and ``Word Smart II'' for students in seventh and eighth grade.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gibson acknowledged that she had not read the entire books
herself after the teacher recommended them, but instead relied on
the reputation that Princeton Review had for publishing quality
study guides.
</P>
<P>
   ``We select our teachers very carefully, and we rely on their
judgment,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When Briggs came to her with complaints about ``Word Smart II,''
she took it home that night to read through it, and and then called
Random House to complain.

 WASHINGTON: clean air.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The EPA did not rank the plants cited on its list Friday. David
Cohen, a spokesman for the EPA, said the four states that filed the
petitions provided information based on computer modeling and ``we
looked at the broad categories to verify the fact that the sources
were contributors.''
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, one of the states with plants covered by the order,
Russ Harding, director of the Department of Environmental Quality,
said: ``I think it's highly inappropriate for the administrator to
be doing this. It may make good headlines, but it's not going to
solve clean-air issues. She's just creating more lawsuits, wasting
more taxpayer dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Michigan had already been planning to publish new
regulations next month putting stricter controls on nitrogen oxide
emissions, but not as strict as the ones ordered Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At First Energy, the parent company of Ohio Edison, Ralph
DiNicola, a spokesman, said, ``The EPA's own studies have indicated
that under heavy ozone- loading days the Midwest plants contribute
to less than 5 percent of the problem in the industrialized
Northeast cities.''
</P>
<P>
   DiNicola said that in the East, people could see stone statues
eroding, another effect of nitrogen emissions, as they stood next
to roads with ``12 lanes of stalled traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a little hard to then take a look at plants 500 miles
away and claim they are the cause of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Browner, the EPA administrator, was not able to say
Friday how many fewer days of ozone violations the East would
record with the new controls in place.
</P>
<P>
   The order uses a procedure outlined in the Clean Air Act
amendments of 1990 under which the states can petition the EPA to
take action against specific smokestacks beyond their borders. The
EPA set out to use the procedure in April, when several states
petitioned, saying they could not meet the strict new ozone
standards the agency had promulgated. But then the appeals court
here held up the new eight-hour standard, and the states withdrew
the petitions, to rewrite them based on the older ozone standard.
Then several industries sued on the basis of the original
petitions. One issue was how much difference a smokestack in
Cincinnati or Detroit could make to the air in Philadelphia or New
York.
</P>
<P>
   But New York, Connecticut and Pennsylvania cited vast swaths of
states near and far, and categories of plants within those areas
Massachusetts, the other state whose petition was approved Friday,
named individual plants, some as far away as Michigan. Another four
jurisdictions filed petitions later that are still under review,
including New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware and the District of
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the complaining states hailed the order. ``The EPA
has come to the realization that we have come to a long time ago,
that trans-boundary pollution exists, and that there are specific
facilities outside New York's borders that are seriously affecting
quality of air here in New York,'' said William Cahill, New York's
commissioner of environmental conservation.
</P>
<P>
   In 30 years of determined work, government regulators have
forced extensive changes in cars, fuels, power plants and even
hairspray to reduce emissions of chemicals that cause smog. But
paired with 30 years of economic growth, they have not succeeded in
eliminating violations.
</P>
<P>
   At the Clean Air Task Force, a nonprofit group, David Wooley, a
lawyer, said that the federal limit for smog was 120 parts ozone
per billion parts of air, and that often in the summer, air
drifting into densely populated areas of the Northeast was already
at 90 parts per billion. Health damage occurs even below 120 parts,
Wooley said, so any reduction would be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Others were skeptical. In Marshall, Mich., a town of less than
7,000, situated 100 miles west of Detroit, Maurice Evans, the city
manager, said he doubted that his town's municipal electric plant
could be affecting air in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a small electric utility,'' Evans said. ``We've got
very little pollution that's coming out of that plant.''

 &HT;    Bush confident as campagin spins forward
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Days before he breaks for the holidays, Gov.
George W. Bush is a confident candidate who pleads immunity to the
charges leveled by what he demeaningly calls ``the chattering
class.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfazed by critics and pundits who doubt his mettle and
intellect, Bush said Friday he believes the GOP presidential
nomination very well could be his by the time Texans vote in their
primary March 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I've got a lot of work to do,'' he said at a news
conference after filing his candidacy in the Texas primary. ``But I
like my chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before, at the kind of carefully choreographed event
that is a Bush campaign hallmark, he told supporters, ``I hope to
come back to you in March and say, `Mission accomplished.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush says all the politically correct things: ``It's a close
race, and I welcome it,'' he says of Arizona Sen. John McCain, a
worthy opponent in New Hampshire. But the campaign is taking a
glimpse beyond clinching the nomination. Tentative plans are being
considered for how to generate publicity in the months between
capturing the nomination and formally accepting it at the national
convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way to do that would be to take a trip,'' Bush said in a
Friday interview.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is looking toward a multination trip in the Western
Hemisphere to demonstrate his support for the North American Free
Trade Agreement and talk about building the hemisphere into a
trading bloc that could compete with the emerging European Union.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, the candidate, who campaigns Monday in New
Hampshire before taking a holiday break through the end of the
year, is focused on Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, the
states with early battles. In addition to fending off McCain, Steve
Forbes and three other GOP foes, Bush is under attack from critics
who say his performance in recent debates raises questions about
whether he is White House material.
</P>
<P>
   Without anger, but with unmistakable disdain, Bush says the
criticism doesn't matter and doesn't bother him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what happened in '94,'' he said, referring to his upset
win over Gov. Ann Richards and launching into a recitation of that
year's conventional wisdom about him. ``He's never done anything,
doesn't believe anything. Everything was given to him. Total
failure. Not very smart. Doesn't understand policy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same routine. It's just repeating itself. There have
been a series of these little hurdles. Can't get off the ground.
This campaign is going be a flop before it begins. Never says
anything. Doesn't have any policy. Won't be specific. Won't answer
questions. Won't do the talk shows. Refuses to debate. And I've
been through this before. I remember '88 when a great man was
labeled by the chattering class and the cartoonists (who said) he
checked his manhood into a blind trust, or wimp,'' he said,
referring to criticism of his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``And someone says, `Well what are you going to do about it?'
and that's win. Guess who is not being affected by it? The voter,''
he said with the kind of confidence being interpreted as cocky by
some of the chattering class.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's confidence in his escalating battle with top challenger
McCain is based on the front-runner's belief that the voters want a
president with chief executive experience, which McCain lacks.
</P>
<P>
   The last U.S. senator elected directly to the White House was
John F. Kennedy in 1960. ``You're making my case,'' Bush told an
interviewer who recounted that fact.
</P>
<P>
   As he heads into the next phase of the campaign, Bush is
publicly showing more of the feistiness he often exhibits in
private.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, you know, `He's got an empty suit,''' Bush told
supporters, working to turn criticism of him into a shot at Al
Gore's recent haberdashery preferences. ``And I said, `At least
it's not an empty earth-tone suit.'''
</P>
<P>
   And although he's still fielding criticism for running a
cocooned campaign heavy on stump-speech sound bites, Bush is
showing an increasing ability to wander from script. He also has
shown an ability to talk his way into near-trouble and navigate
himself out.
</P>
<P>
   In a Thursday interview on CNN's ``Larry King Live,'' Bush made
a midcourse correction in an answer about trade sanctions against
Cuba. King suggested that the sanctions strike hardest at Cuba's
poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not their fault,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's not their ... yes, a little bit their fault,'' Bush
said, adding moments later, ``I mean, in a sense that, you know, I
would hope they ... well, maybe not. Maybe, you're right. I
shouldn't say that. The Cuban regime is so repressive, and they've
got secret police policing everybody that it's awfully hard for
people to express their will. But we should not _ we should not
provide capital to a Fidel Castro government to keep them propped
up.''
</P>
<P>
   At a Friday news conference, Bush adroitly handled another
foreign policy question with a couple of potentially dicey answers.
The governor was asked what his law enforcement advisers tell him
about their confidence in Mexican law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   One possible answer, fraught with credibility problems, would be
full confidence in the Mexican police. Another possible answer
would be a full assault on the integrity of Mexican law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Bush talked his way to a middle, non-newsworthy ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is no question that there is a lot of concern
about justice in Mexico. I think President Zedillo shares that
concern,'' he said, adding that reforms are planned. ``They
recognized that there needs to be a substantial upgrading of the
law enforcement efforts in Mexico. And step one is to recognize
there is a problem. They've recognized there is a problem, and step
two is to put a plan in place to do so. I haven't been down to
Mexico since then, but I certainly hope the reforms they've
proposed are being implemented.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNBURY, Pa. _ In the 1920s, with their corner stores thriving,
Harry and Sigmund Weis decided to build neighboring houses on
choice land in this small Susquehanna Valley city.
</P>
<P>
   The brick homes, one colonial and one Tudor, bordered the
riverbank and looked out to the gently sloping Appalachian
Mountains. The two brothers shared a garage; their young children _
a son and a daughter for each _ ran back and forth across the
driveway when they played in their front yards.
</P>
<P>
   Over the decades, the Weises transformed their small markets
into a modern supermarket chain. By owning their own trucks and
warehouses, keeping out labor unions and staunchly refusing to take
on debt, the brothers, and later their sons, created the most
profitable grocery company in the country, with margins four or
five times those of their competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, the Weises became one of the wealthiest families in the
United States, slowly expanding their central Pennsylvania chain as
far as upstate New York and the Virginia suburbs of Washington _
and popping into the public eye only when they appeared on Forbes
magazine's annual list of the richest Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Harry's and Sigmund's father had bequeathed his corner
store to them, they handed the business down to their sons, Robert
and Sigfried Weis (pronounced ``wise''). Although Weis Markets Inc.
went public in 1965, the family kept control, retaining about
four-fifths of the shares. There was little intrigue and a lot of
profit.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last few years, profits have been stagnant, and in
the last month, intrigue has inevitably developed. Like the
Binghams, the Hunts, the Kochs and so many business families before
them, the Weises are now locked in an intense fight for control of
the company that has given them their fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides of the family that were once divided by only a
driveway are now split over one of the central questions in today's
economy: Can a small company, even one with a long history of
success, prosper in an era of consolidation?
</P>
<P>
   That the debate is taking place at Weis, which has achieved
almost legendary status in its industry, illustrates just how
difficult it is for family businesses to survive from one
generation to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Sigmund's descendants, with one eye on the fast-expanding
Wal-Mart Stores and the other on grocery behemoths like Royal Ahold
N.V. that have arisen from the consolidation spree of the 1990s,
want to look into selling the company. Led by Janet L. Weis, 80,
the widow of Sigmund's son, Sigfried, they are mounting a proxy
fight for two additional board seats, which would give them four of
the seven.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Weis, her three daughters and their husbands, who own a 41
percent stake, see declining margins and a company stock that,
before the feud burst into the open, was worth less than it was in
1987. They worry that the company risks a long, slow decline if it
stays independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The handwriting is really on the wall,'' Mrs. Weis said. On
Friday, shares of the 200-store chain closed at $41.25, up 18
percent in the last three weeks amid investors' hopes for a sale.
</P>
<P>
   But Harry's family, which now runs the business after decades
behind the scenes, has no intention of surrendering to its cousins
or to its larger rivals. Led by Robert Weis, Harry's 80-year-old
son, they say the current competition is similar to earlier
threats, when better capitalized supermarkets entered but failed to
crack their mid-Atlantic markets. Weis Markets still has
above-average margins.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are reading the facts wrong,'' said Robert Weis, a
soft-spoken man who still has a full head of gray hair. Weis, who
with his three children and his sister, also owns a 41 percent
stake in the company worth $700 million. He had served as deputy to
Sigfried, Janet Weis' husband, for more than 30 years and took over
the chairman's slot in 1995. Sigfried's family no longer has anyone
in management, and Robert's family has offered to buy out its
cousins' share.
</P>
<P>
   The battle has many trappings of a takeover struggle. Sigmund's
and Sigfried's family has hired Salomon Smith Barney and Wachtel,
Lipton, Rosen &AMP; Katz, a New York law firm, to advise them on how to
lobby shareholders, oust the current board and put the company up
for sale. Harry's and Robert's family has retained Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &AMP; Garrison, another
Manhattan-based law firm.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute, meanwhile, has split the Susquehanna Valley, where
hospital wings, arts centers and major buildings at two
universities, Bucknell and Susquehanna, bear the Weis name. And it
has chilled friendships among the principal players, who used to
play golf together and still routinely eat lunch at the same
restaurant, though not the same table.
</P>
<P>
   But this is also a family feud with a twist. So far, it is
nearly bereft of nastiness. Neither side doubts the other's motive,
only their conclusion. Over the last month, Janet Weis and her
allies have publicly praised the way Robert Weis and his deputies
have managed the company, even as she seeks to oust him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone respects the job they're doing,'' said Joseph I.
Goldstein, Mrs. Weis' son-in-law and a member of the board.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than trade allegations, the two sides share a sense of
melancholy that they are locked in a public squabble likely to end
up humiliating one branch of the family.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first thought about this, it was sad,'' said Michael
Morris Apfelbaum, a lifelong family friend and, as a lawyer
overseeing some of the stock, the second dissident board member.
``But when you cut out the emotion from it, you have to realize
this is the way of capitalism. You have to be big to survive in the
economy today. That's just the way of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   At least it's what the debate is about.
</P>
<P>
   The Weises have been merchants in these parts since shortly
after the Civil War, when Sigfried Weis immigrated from Austria and
made his way to central Pennsylvania. To earn a living, he walked
from farmhouse to farmhouse in the lush fields of the Susquehanna
Valley _ less than 100 miles from where the Battle of Gettysburg
had raged just a few years before _ selling jewelry and other
goods.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he opened a general store in Selinsgrove, a town across
the river from here, and he married a local woman; they would have
two sons. When the boys grew up, Sigfried Weis hung up a sign: ``S.
Weis &AMP; Sons.''
</P>
<P>
   After his death in 1907, the sons _ Sigmund and Harry _ opened a
new store in Sunbury, the county seat, focused on groceries. It was
the start of a furious expansion that lasted nearly 30 years and
did not end until the Depression, when they had more than 100
outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Already, a division of labor was emerging that would last for
almost a century. Sigmund, the more outgoing brother, was the
marketer who decided which national brands the stores should sell.
Harry, a lawyer, scouted real estate, picking where the next Weis
Pure Foods would go, family members say.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the shops enabled the brothers to build their
neighboring houses on Front Street, just a few blocks from
Sunbury's main square and their first store.
</P>
<P>
   The Depression, however, prompted shoppers to look for more
bargains and helped usher in the era of self-service supermarkets.
In 1937, Sigmund and Harry Weis started closing many of their
stores to create a smaller chain of larger stores.
</P>
<P>
   Weis Markets, which owned more of its stores and more of its
equipment than competitors did, thrived. It sold an unusually large
number of private-label products. And it fought bitterly to keep
unions from organizing its workers, many of whom were part-timers
without benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in a 1965 registration with the Securities and Exchange
Commission to take the company public, virtually the only problem
that the family noted was a yearlong strike by meat-department
employees starting in the summer of 1963. Five years later, the
company and a food workers' union fought all the way to the Supreme
Court in a landmark case over whether a shopping mall was a public
place where the union, covered by First Amendment speech
protection, could try to organize.
</P>
<P>
   (The union won in court, but Weis has defeated every effort to
organize the company's employees, including one by the Teamsters
this year.)
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1960s, the company achieved operating margins of more
than 8 percent. Weis was the envy of the grocery industry, where
margins of 2 percent or 3 percent were much more common. When Weis
Markets Inc. went public in 1965, the shares made their debut at
$21. Each side of the family was suddenly worth more than $20
million.
</P>
<P>
   By then, both Sigmund and Harry Weis had died, and their sons
were running the business. Sigfried _ Sigmund's son, named for the
family patriarch _ was four years older than Robert, and they had
followed similar paths. As children, both worked behind the counter
at some of the original Weis Pure Foods stores. Both served in the
Army. Both attended Yale.
</P>
<P>
   It was during college that Sigfried Weis met his future wife,
Janet. He was a freshman and she was a 15-year-old who lived in the
nearby town of Hamden, Conn. He did not win her over immediately.
``It was one of those back-and-forth things,'' she said this month
at her home, grinning between puffs on a thin cigarette.
Eventually, after they were married at the Carlyle Hotel in New
York, she followed him back to Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Sigfried became president of the company in 1961 without much
debate, family members say. He was older than Robert, who became
his deputy. Robert ran the company's finances and, like his father,
chose sites for new stores, and the two cousins remained in those
jobs for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   They had lunch together most days and lived in the same
neighborhood, separated only by an alley.
</P>
<P>
   But by all accounts, Sigfried and Robert Weis were not as close
as their daily proximity suggested. They were business partners,
not best friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were different, but we were friendly,'' Robert said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just moved in different circles,'' Janet Weis said.
</P>
<P>
   Like his father, Sigfried was the more social of the two. He and
Janet belonged to the country-club crowd and gave their money to
large institutions, like a regional hospital. Robert and his wife,
Patricia, gave to the small hospital in Sunbury.
</P>
<P>
   Differences in the ages of the two couples' children pushed them
further apart. The three daughters of Sigfried and Janet were all
at least 10 years older than the two daughters and son of Robert
and Patricia. The next generation _ second cousins who shared a
last name and a fortune and grew up only yards away from each other
_ still do not know each other well. There was never a blow-up,
both sides say. The two families simply drifted apart.
</P>
<P>
   That estrangement, particularly in the context of the strong
stock market, is dangerous, said John Messervey, president of the
National Family Business Council, an Illinois consulting firm that,
among other things, runs retreats where wealthy families can get to
know one another better. Many families, Messervey said, ``are
scared they're never going to see a market this good again.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Weises in the 1970s and '80s, there seemed to be little
reason for worry. Operating margins never fell below 7 percent and,
as late as 1987, were above 9 percent. Weis Markets, a 1982
headline in Forbes magazine said, ``makes one-third of what Safeway
does _ on only 5 percent of Safeway's sales.'' The same year, the
grandsons of the Austrian peddler appeared on the magazine's list
of the 400 wealthiest Americans.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the year after the Weises fell off the Forbes list, a
squat, enormous distributor center began rising just off of
Interstate 99 in western Pennsylvania. When completed, it covered
more than 800,000 square feet, and it bore the corporate name that
strikes fear into virtually every other retailer in the country:
Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   There could be no doubt about the building's purpose. Like a
massing of troops at an enemy's border, its size was an
announcement that an unstoppable invasion was about to begin.
Wal-Mart was bringing supercenters, stores that sell everything
from milk and bananas to slacks and tires and are three times the
size of modern supermarkets, to Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Supercenters, the first of which opened in 1988, had already
transformed the $420 billion-a-year grocery business. To respond to
Wal-Mart's efficient distribution network and its money-saving
clout with suppliers, supermarket executives were rapidly
consolidating one of the few remaining large regional businesses in
the United States. Their aim was to cut costs and gain the kind of
power over manufacturers that Wal-Mart has.
</P>
<P>
   The five biggest chains now take in 40 cents of every dollar
that Americans spend at the supermarket, up from 20 cents in 1993,
according to the Food Institute, a trade group in Fair Lawn, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   For Weis Markets, the changes were coming at a bad time. It had
been facing tough competition from Giant Foods of Carlisle, Pa.,
which had expanded in the area during the late '80s and early '90s.
By 1996, Giant had actually overtaken Weis in central Pennsylvania
with an 18 percent market share, according to Food Trade News, a
publication that tracks grocery sales in the mid-Atlantic states.
At the same time, inflation was almost nonexistent, leaving grocers
little room to raise prices.
</P>
<P>
   Weis' legendary operating margins paid the price. From their
high of 9.2 percent in 1987, they fell to 5.5 percent in 1993 and
just 4.1 percent last year. Operating margins for the rest of the
industry are now 3 percent. The company posted net income of $83.7
million last year on $1.87 billion in sales, about $3 million less
than it earned in 1989 on $1.24 billion in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers _ along with the specter of Wal-Mart and the new
grocery giants _ are at the core of the argument of Sigfried Weis'
family. The chain still has many strengths, like its $400 million
in cash, its milk and ice cream plants and its brand's reputation.
But the company should act quickly, the family says, to determine
whether it should participate in the current consolidation wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies rise and fall, and we want to make sure this company
keeps rising,'' said Goldstein, a director who is a partner at
Kirkpatrick &AMP; Lockhart in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Robert Weis and the president of the company,
Norman Rich, say that is precisely what it has been doing for the
past few years. In 1995, when Robert took over from an ailing
Sigfried, the company began a capital investment push even more
aggressive than the one undertaken by Sigmund and Harry Weis in the
1920s. In the last four years, the company has spent $374 million
to build 35 large new markets and to remodel 51 others.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion has helped increase revenue by 7.5 percent through
the first three quarters of 1999. The company, meanwhile, has begun
working with a cooperative of smaller chains, cutting deals with
manufacturers similar to the discounts the bigger companies can
negotiate, Rich said.
</P>
<P>
   The proof of Weis' relative strength can be seen in its stock,
they added. From Jan. 1 to Nov. 29, just before the proxy fight
began, the company's stock fell only 8 percent versus 35 percent
for the Standard &AMP; Poor's supermarket industry index.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity, Harry Weis' descendants say, undercuts their
cousins' main point: that a small chain can no longer hold its own.
``Back in 1928, Safeway Stores came with the same story and tried
to buy our company,'' Robert Weis said last week, speaking softly
while sitting in the company's modest boardroom here.
``Fortunately, we said no.''
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon after Thanksgiving, however, the phone rang in the
office of Rich, Weis' president. A native of New York City whose
gregariousness stands in contrast to the Weis family's reserve,
Rich had joined Weis Markets in 1964 as a food scientist and
climbed up the ranks, reaching his current position in 1994, He
runs daily operations and reports to Robert Weis, the chairman.
(The company has never used the title of chief executive.)
</P>
<P>
   The phone call, Rich recalled, came from Apfelbaum, the
director, who said, ``Norm, can you come down to my office?''
Apfelbaum said it was an emergency. His father, Sidney Apfelbaum,
who oversees a trust that owns Weis stock, and Goldstein, Mrs.
Weis' son-in-law, were also there.
</P>
<P>
   Rich drove to the law offices of Apfelbaum, Apfelbaum &AMP;
Apfelbaum, in a converted house off the town square. The three men
waiting for him said they believed Weis Markets should seriously
investigate selling itself and that they wanted to install
directors who agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The proxy fight, and family feud, had begun.
</P>
<P>
   The decision had come slowly for the dissidents, over a series
of informal discussions among themselves and during the occasional
cocktail hours that Apfelbaum and Mrs. Weis have together at her
house, a four-bedroom Tudor on 14 acres across the Susquehanna
River from Sunbury.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Apfelbaum, whose father grew up playing pool with
Robert Weis on the third floor of his Front Street house, and
Goldstein, a former associate director of enforcement at the SEC,
decided they had to act.
</P>
<P>
   Sigfried's family has asked that the company hold a shareholder
vote by Feb. 7, citing company bylaws, on whether to replace the
board. Since each family controls 41 percent of the votes, the
resolution would need the approval of more than half of the 18
percent of investors who are not family members.
</P>
<P>
   Most outsiders consider the dissidents to be the favorites; in
recent years, shareholders have tended to choose whatever path is
most likely to bolster a stock price immediately. Salomon argues
that the company could fetch $45 to $55 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Charles M. LaLoggia, a Rochester fund manager who publishes an
investment newsletter, said he thinks the company would sell for at
least $45 a share and maybe up to $90, given its strong balance
sheet and recent valuations for other chains.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Investors would be unlikely to turn down a deal in that range.
``As far as the dissidents work for all the shareholders, they're
our guys,'' said Martin J. Whitman, who runs a $1.5 billion fund
that has owned Weis stock since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But a vote would probably be close. About three-fifths of the
independent investors, representing 11 percent of the company's
stock, are individuals, Rich said. They are more likely to focus on
the company's long record of paying strong dividends, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Rich and Robert Weis will also argue that the company would not
fetch a fair price now, because many potential suitors are trading
near 52-week lows. Albertson's and Kroger, for example, are busy
integrating the chains they have already bought, and their recent
earnings disappointments show they have a ways to go. ``A lot of
the retailers have got their hands full right now,'' said Mark
Husson, a supermarket analyst at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   For the company, the stakes are obviously high. But they seem
almost as high for the region and the two Weis families. The chain
employs 19,000 people, and its higher-paying, middle-management
jobs would be most vulnerable in a takeover. Those positions are
concentrated in central Pennsylvania, a coal and agricultural
region that has suffered economically over the last three decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average person thinks this just can't be good,'' David L.
Persing, the mayor of Sunbury since 1989, said of the dispute. ``It
might be good for stockholders, but I don't think it will be good
for this area.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the Weises, or their allies on either side, are likely
to emerge from the fight worse off financially. But the dispute has
already had personal costs. It has effectively ended the friendship
of Apfelbaum and Rich, who still see each other at Tedd's Landing,
a local restaurant where both have lunch. Only last summer,
Apfelbaum said, the two men smoked cigars together at 4 a.m. at the
W Hotel on Lexington Avenue in Manhattan, just hours after Rich's
son had been married.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Weis, meanwhile, has chosen to spend part of her 81st year
fighting a public battle over the company her late husband ran for
35 years, a company she helped build by tasting samples of new
products and telling her husband which labels looked right. ``It's
been all of my life,'' Mrs. Weis said.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has been most difficult for Robert Weis, said people
who know him, though he is reluctant to discuss his personal
feelings. As he nears retirement and grooms his 32-year-old son,
Jonathan, to succeed him, the family of his longtime boss is trying
to depose him.
</P>
<P>
   ``People's conditions in life change. Their needs change. Their
desires change,'' the older Weis said, explaining what he sees as
the reasons for the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess every time you have a partner, you have a problem,''
he added, ``maybe not with the partner, but with the next
generation.''

TIGHT CURBS ORDERED ON USE OF NUCLEAR SECRETS IN SCIENTIST'S TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal magistrate has imposed tight restrictions
on the release of nuclear secrets in court in the case of a former
scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory charged with
mishandling and copying classified materials.
</P>
<P>
   Don Svet, a U.S. magistrate in Albuquerque, N.M., ordered that
all classified information the defense seeks to introduce in the
case of the former Los Alamos scientist, Wen Ho Lee, must be
screened under the Classified Information Procedures Act of 1981
before it can become evidence. The law was enacted to prevent
defendants in national security cases from using the threat of
divulging secrets to force the government to drop its prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was arrested on Dec. 10 and charged in a 59-count indictment
with transferring vast amounts of nuclear data from a classified
computer system into an unsecure system, and then copying the
material onto portable computer tapes. Of the 10 tapes the
government says he made, seven are still missing.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has not been charged with giving the secret information to
an unauthorized person or to a foreign government, and has not been
charged with espionage.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Lee pleaded not guilty to the charges and was ordered
held until his trial.
</P>
<P>
   The magistrate's order calls for a court security officer to
review any documents submitted by the defense to determine whether
they are classified, and then to keep the information sealed.
Closed hearings can then be held to determine if the information
can be admitted as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The magistrate's ruling applies to pretrial hearings and
motions, and the judge assigned to the case, Chief Judge John
Conway of the U.S. District Court in Albuquerque, will rule later
on the use of classified materials in the trial itself.
</P>
<P>
   Just days before a federal grand jury indicted Lee, senior
officials in the Clinton administration met at the White House and
decided that the case should go forward, even if some material was
divulged.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials say that Lee, who worked in the X Division
at Los Alamos, which designs nuclear weapons, transferred and
copied a vast archive of nuclear secrets, including recently
updated computer codes about the most recent designs of nuclear
warheads.

CAMPAIGN HEATS UP AS GORE, BRADLEY CLASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ In the increasingly acrimonious Democratic
presidential contest, Al Gore and Bill Bradley clashed repeatedly
but politely Friday night over which of them would do more to
protect Medicare for senior citizens, provide quality health
insurance to more Americans and improve public education for more
children.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp exchanges occurred during a town hall meeting at
Daniel Webster College, sponsored by ABC's ``Nightline.'' About 300
New Hampshire voters attended and asked questions about terrorism,
school violence, space exploration, gay rights, health care and
education in the course of the spirited 90-minute session in which
both candidates demonstrated their easy mastery of policy detail _
and talent for offering very long answers to short questions.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the subject of health care where the candidates
differed most dramatically. The vice president, for example,
pressed Bradley to explain what he would do to protect Medicare as
the baby boom generation doubles the ranks of beneficiaries. And he
accused Bradley of serving up a plan that would leave too many
unprotected in New Hampshire and, because of its great cost, could
endanger the economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, on the other hand, said there is plenty of time to
resolve concerns about the future solvency of Medicare. The more
urgent question of the hour, he said, is how to help the 44 million
Americans who don't have health insurance obtain it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've offered a plan to do that,'' Bradley said. ``The question
I would ask Al, the main difference between our programs - I do
provide access to affordable quality health care for all Americans.
My question to you is, who will you leave out?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, however, insisted that he is intent on reaching universal
health care for all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't leave out anyone,'' said Gore, who favors a
step-by-step health insurance expansion that begins by guaranteeing
coverage for all children.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over the health care coverage has been the main
source of discord between the two on the campaign trail, and it was
the topic the two would return to again and again Friday night. In
most cases, it was Gore who took the rhetorical fight to Bradley,
challenging him to defend his ideas. Even when the voter question
was about putting a man on Mars, the conversation wound around to
health care. Gore said it is more important to get to universal
health insurance on Earth, first.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has yet to tell us who he'd leave out,'' Bradley
interjected.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one,'' Gore shot back.
</P>
<P>
   On Medicare, Gore said he would set aside 15 percent of the
federal budget surplus to shore up the health insurance program,
while accusing Bradley of offering no plan to prepare for the
increased number of future seniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill does not set aside a penny for it; he said we can save
that for later,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, however, cited his 18 years of work on the Senate
Finance Committee, saying he had prevented Medicare premiums from
going up on numerous occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one should doubt my commitment to making sure Medicare is
solvent,'' Bradley said, noting that the program is expected to be
whole until 2017.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't doubt your commitment, I doubt your plan,'' Gore
replied, then continued with another of his common criticisms of
Bradley's plan:
</P>
<P>
   ``You cancel Medicaid and give people a $150 voucher to replace
it,'' Gore charged, contending that people in New Hampshire would
find no private health plans for such a low sum.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley _ and later his aides _ disputed the $150 figure, saying
there would other sources of insurance available. The senator also
noted that his prediction about the risks of offering detailed
plans had come true. ``I've said. . .it was going to be like
throwing raw meat in a cage of wolves and they were going to chew
it up, and, you know, that's what's happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The constant back-and-forthing over Medicare for seniors and
Bradley's health plan for other Americans Friday night represented
the Democrats' contest to date in miniature. For months, the
candidates have been focused almost all their rhetorical cross-fire
on this one subject.
</P>
<P>
   But the pair also battled over school vouchers Friday night,
with Gore accusing Bradley of not yet offering a comprehensive
education proposal in his campaign, and of voting for private
school vouchers while in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he has offered numerous education proposals,
including one for early childhood education, and he said he voted
for vouchers while in the Senate only as an experiment. ``I do not
believe vouchers are the answer to the problems of public
education,'' Bradley said, adding that he never supported taking
money away from public schools to fund private school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   The touched on a number of other topics during the course of the
forum, in many cases underscoring more basic areas of agreement
than differences. Both said they are strong supporters of equal
rights for gays and lesbians, though both opposed legalization of
gay marriage. Both advocated new forms of gun control, though
Bradley was more specific on the topic. Both said they wished the
media would be more responsible about broadcasting images of sex
and violence. And both, responding to Ted Koppel's opening
question, said they think their wives are terrific and would be
activist First Ladies.
</P>
<P>
   Both were also asked whether they thought it appropriate for the
Republican candidates, at their recent Iowa debate, to underscore
their personal belief in God and Jesus Christ. Both said they had
no problem with the assertions by the GOP candidates, though
Bradley said he had decided he would not respond to such inquiries
about a private beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley have been locked in a dead heat in New
Hampshire for weeks, with Bradley's rise in the polls flattening
out and Gore's effort seeming to regain its footing with voters.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the two campaigns had taken markedly different
tacks as they sold themselves to the voters. Gore, for example, has
delivered harsh critiques of Bradley's proposals. Bradley, on the
other hand, has remained largely silent in the face of the
onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   At their first town hall meeting at Dartmouth College, Gore
slammed Bradley for spending too much money on his health care
proposal, contending he would use up the budget surplus without
protecting Medicare, the federal health insurance program for the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley blandly disagreed, saying, ``We each have our own
experts. I dispute the cost figure Al has used.''
</P>
<P>
   Since that moment, Gore has pounded Bradley relentlessly on the
subject. ``He's a good man with a bad plan,'' Gore has said, and
said again Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   After quietly taking the abuse, Bradley finally responded last
Sunday in Florida. He said it was ``dismaying'' for one Democrat to
attack another on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, which are
``articles of faith'' for members of the party.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the Bradley campaign issued a 24-page packet called
``Just the facts,'' explaining his health care plan and responding
to each ``Gore attack.'' The campaign also released a comparison of
Gore and Bradley's health proposals from its own experts,
contending that Gore only covers 7 million Americans, compared to
Bradley, who would provide insurance for 30 million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been clear in the last couple weeks that he's starting to
get aggressive with his approach,'' said John Rauh, one of
Bradley's top backers in the state..
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bradley told WSMN radio Friday, ``There's no question
that I'm going to correct misrepresentations and we'll get the
contrasts.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Cardinal John O'Connor prepares to step down as
archbishop, Roman Catholics in his New York archdiocese are hoping
for a successor who will be more spiritual than political, a
compassionate leader who will tackle poverty and homelessness as
priorities of the church, a survey by The New York Times has found.
</P>
<P>
   A strong majority of Catholics polled in the New York region
said things were going well or excellently for the church in
America. As Catholics do nationally, though, they favor modernizing
and opening up the church by allowing priests to marry, ordaining
women as priests and granting lay people a greater say in naming
bishops.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of an economic boom, Catholics in the financial
capital of the world's richest country told pollsters in several
ways that they consider poverty and homelessness the most serious
problems the church should address.
</P>
<P>
   The survey offered a snapshot of feelings among the New York
archdiocese's 2.4 million Catholics at a pivotal moment in the life
of their church. Church officials expect O'Connor, the leader of
the church in New York for the last 15 years, to step down soon.
</P>
<P>
   Though the cardinal, following tradition, offered Pope John Paul
II his resignation upon turning 75, the pope did not accept it. But
next month, the cardinal will turn 80, automatically losing his
vote in the papal conclave. He has also been battling ill health
recently, after surgery last summer to remove a brain tumor. For
the last two Sundays, he has not said Mass at St. Patrick's
Cathedral and has not appeared in public.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to questions about the next archbishop, the poll
asked Catholics about the cardinal, whose voice has been a
prominent one on some of the most debated issues of the day. But
among New York Catholics, O'Connor seemed to carry a low profile.
</P>
<P>
   While 57 percent had a favorable view of him, and just 6 percent
had an outright unfavorable opinion, only a small percentage could
name the best, or worst, things he has done as archbishop.
Spiritually, they say they are more influenced by Pope John Paul II
and by their local priests than they are by the cardinal. Forty-two
percent said his stands on social and political issues had no
influence on them at all.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, religious experts said, appear to reflect the
ambiguity inherent in the position of archbishop itself that even
O'Connor's political visibility has been unable to overcome. A
spokesman for the archdiocese questioned the usefulness of the poll
and declined to comment on the results.
</P>
<P>
   The findings also demonstrate the increasing independence of
Catholics, a trend that most experts on the church say began with
the changes of the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s and has
deepened throughout Pope John Paul II's return to a stricter, more
hierarchical tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Though the cardinal leads the archdiocese _ through his public
stands, management of finances and assignment of priests _ his
influence is not always direct or obvious. To most churchgoers,
archbishops are more distant figures than their parish priests and
yet not as exalted as the pope. Thirty-two percent of New York
Catholics said their priests had ``a lot'' of effect on their
spiritual lives, while 39 percent said the same of the pope. Only
16 percent said the same of O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really listen to what the archbishop says,'' said
Abraham Blanco, 74, a retired butcher in the Bronx who was
reinterviewed after responding to the poll.
</P>
<P>
   Blanco said he paid more mind to the pope, whom he said he
admires for his extensive visits throughout the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Awn, a professor of comparative religion at Columbia
University, said the cardinal's role is more ``as a father figure
and the unifying symbol of the church in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll showed that Catholics were evenly divided over whether
the choice of the next archbishop would make a difference in the
life of the church. Asked for the most important qualities that the
next archbishop should have, Catholics most frequently said that
the next cardinal should be compassionate and humane, should help
the poor and homeless, show strong leadership and not be overtly
political. In addition, 8 percent of those polled said they hoped
for somebody similar to O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 37 percent of Catholics who offered an opinion on
O'Connor's best qualities as archbishop, the largest percentages,
25 percent, noted his work helping the poor and unifying the
church.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the most important problems facing the church, 59
percent had definite opinions. The most common response was
poverty, followed by the shortage of priests, abortion, declining
membership, and failure to keep up with the times and connect with
people.

</P>
<P>
   More than half of New York's Catholics thought lay people should
have a say in selecting the next archbishop. The selection is a
thoroughly secret matter, which draws in only select churchgoers
sworn to silence, followed by discussions among bishops that result
in nominations being passed to Rome under papal secrecy. The final
decision rests solely with the pope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should have input, but the final decision should be
with the pope,'' said Jasmine Thompson, a job recruiter in
Manhattan who responded to the poll. She said she hoped the next
cardinal would prove ``open as you can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thompson added, ``I understand that you still have to
support and defend the position of the Catholic Church, but I think
that in some cases there is room for flexibility and compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   But another participant, Aloysius Manz, 71, of Montgomery, a
retired manager at IBM, disagreed. ``What you'd get is a popularity
contest,'' he said. ``A lot of the decisions a cardinal has to make
are going to be unpopular with people, Catholics and others, but
when it's right, it's right.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Joseph W. Koterski, a philosophy professor at Fordham
University, said the support for giving lay people more of a say in
selecting bishops reflected the American enthusiasm for democracy.
``What people do know is that our country works well in a
democratic process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In applying statistical methods to understand faith _ which can
be amorphous and changeable _ the Times survey revealed an
intriguing mix of contradictions among believers and nonbelievers.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 40 percent of those who identified themselves as
practicing Catholics, for example, nevertheless said they consider
the church as an institution to be out of touch with the needs of
Catholics today. But they gauged specific people, like their local
priests, deacons, the cardinal and the pope, as more aware of their
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Just the same, a majority of practicing Catholics said they
seldom or never consult their priests about personal problems.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one in four people who identified themselves as former
Catholics said nevertheless that the pope had some or a lot of
influence on their spiritual lives.
</P>
<P>
   Of all Catholics polled, only 2 percent consider the sacraments
the most important aspect of being a Catholic. Far more important,
they said, were faith, the church teachings and belief in Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Thomas J. Reese, a Jesuit, said the survey's findings
illustrate that faith is complex and that the decision to go to
church springs from the spiritual quest for meaning, not from
feelings about a specific clergyman or even a teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not surprising that people recognize our limitations,''
said Reese, the author of the 1989 book, ``Archbishop: Inside the
Power Structure of the American Catholic Church.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``What's remarkable is that people still come. They're
seeing something that's deeper than the human reality, or the
person in the sanctuary.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll found practicing Catholics were much more inclined to
be opposed to extramarital sex than to homosexuality: 68 percent
said a person ``who engages in homosexual relations'' could still
be a good Catholic, while only 42 percent said a person ``who is
having an affair outside of marriage'' could be one.
</P>
<P>
   Through these and other answers, New York Catholics appeared
more accepting of homosexuality than church leaders are, and some
found fault with the cardinal for taking a public stand on the
issue. Elizabeth Gray, 45, of Monroe, said she generally liked the
cardinal but disagreed with his condemnation of gays' marching in
the St. Patrick's Day Parade. ``It was like him telling the gays
they're never going to see God, that they don't have a chance to go
to heaven,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Catholics generally consider the views of O'Connor
and other church leaders to be more conservative than their own.
For example, 57 percent favor allowing priests to marry, 48 percent
say they favor letting gays be priests if they remain celibate and
61 percent favor ordaining women as priests.
</P>
<P>
   But the survey found that Hispanics, who account for 36 percent
of Catholics in the archdiocese, tend to be more conservative than
other Catholics. They were, however, less supportive of O'Connor,
largely because they felt they did not know him. While two-thirds
of all Catholics in the archdiocese had a favorable view of the
cardinal, less than half of the Hispanic Catholics did did.
</P>

<P>
   POLLING METHODOLOGY
</P>
<P>
   The latest New York Times Poll is based on telephone interviews
conducted from Nov. 29 to Dec. 5 with 1,615 adults who live in the
Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York. Interviews were conducted
in English or Spanish. The archdiocese comprises Manhattan, the
Bronx and Staten Island and the counties of Dutchess, Orange,
Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan, Ulster and Westchester.
</P>
<P>
   Of these respondents, 567 said their religious preference was
Catholic, 198 said they were former Catholics, and 853 said they
were non-Catholics. For analysis, the responses of Catholics,
former Catholics and non-Catholics were separated.
</P>
<P>
   The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a
computer from a complete list of exchanges in the 10 counties. The
exchanges were chosen so as to assure that each county was
represented in proportion to its number of active phone numbers.
For each exchange, the final four numerals were formed by random
digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers.
Within each household, one adult was designated by a random
procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been weighted to take account of household size
and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for
variations in the sample relating to geographic area, race,
Hispanic origin, sex, age and education.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such
samples will differ by no more than 2 percentage points in either
direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all
adults living in the archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   For smaller subgroups, the potential sampling error is larger.
For example, it is plus or minus 4 percentage points for Catholics.

GLORIA CARUSO MURRAY, ARTIST AND DAUGHTER OF TENOR, DIES AT 79  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Calif., Md., Italy, France)   By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gloria Caruso Murray, a visual artist who was the last surviving
child of Enrico Caruso, died Dec. 5 at St. Luke's Hospital in
Jacksonville, Fla. She was 79 and had briefly tried to live up to
the musical world's sentimental fantasy that she had inherited her
father's vocal abilities.
</P>
<P>
   She died of cancer, said Aldo Mancusi, curator of the Caruso
Museum in Brooklyn, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Only hours after his daughter's birth on Dec. 18, 1919, at the
Knickerbocker Hotel just a stone's throw from the old Metropolitan
Opera House in New York, Caruso, then the most famous operatic
tenor in the world, exuberantly tossed the girl into the air,
peered into her mouth and announced, ``Ah, she has the vocal cords,
just like her Daddy!''
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half later, Caruso was dead at 48 _ a loss that
nourished a popular fantasy that his child would also have an
extraordinary voice.
</P>
<P>
   At age 7, when she and her mother returned to New York from a
vacation in Europe, a New York newspaper ran the headline ``Gloria
Caruso, Here With a Voice'' and pronounced her ``a potential opera
star of the first magnitude.''
</P>
<P>
   The next year she made her first record. At 11, she made her
first public appearance, delivering a radio address on behalf of a
charity headed by President Herbert Hoover. Later that year she
made a test recording for RCA Victor, and John McCormack, another
renowned tenor, gave her singing lessons and announced that she had
promise.
</P>
<P>
   The press had an immense appetite for even the slightest tidbits
of news about the great Caruso's daughter. But it gradually became
apparent that she did not have the voice to follow her father.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, Ms. Murray told a reporter that she was studying art at
the Art Students League in New York and that she had come to prefer
the visual arts to music. ``I've always been torn between art and
music,'' she said. ``Daddy drew and sculptured as a hobby. And
Mommy draws. Art is as much in the family as singing.''
</P>
<P>
   In marrying Caruso, her mother, an American named Dorothy
Benjamin, created a tumult in 1918. Her father, Park Benjamin, a
wealthy patent lawyer and New York society figure, fiercely opposed
the match between his daughter, then 25, to Caruso, who was 45.
After the couple eloped, Park Benjamin disowned her. When he died
in 1925, he left her $1 from his substantial estate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1943, Gloria Caruso married Ensign Michael Hunt Murray, who
had left Harvard to become a naval aviator in World War II. The
couple had two sons but later divorced.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Murray set up a studio in New York City where she painted
both portraits and landscapes. Later she lived in Miami and, for
the last 10 years, in Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Farkas, co-author with Enrico Caruso Jr. of ``Enrico
Caruso: My Father and My Family'' (Amadeus Press, 1990), said that
Ms. Murray's paintings were ``of good quality, although she sold
very few.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She became rather reclusive,'' Farkas said, adding, ``She had
been answering questions about her father for a long time.'' Eric
D. Murray, one of Ms. Murray's sons, said his mother had become
occupied with managing the family estate after her mother died in
1957.
</P>
<P>
   Matters were complicated because Caruso had left no will. In
1928, a court in Trenton, N.Y., had ruled that Gloria Caruso was
entitled to two-thirds of the royalties on her father's phonograph
records, sold by the Victor Talking Machine Co.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Caruso attended Miss Hewitt's Classes in New York City,
the Ozanne School in Paris, the Bishop School in La Jolla, Calif.,
and Miss Nixon's School in Florence, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her son Eric, of Maryland, she is survived by her
other son, Colin D. Murray of Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   Farkas wrote that Enrico Caruso had four children from a
relationship with Ada Giacchetti, a soprano who had left her
husband to live with the tenor before his marriage to Miss
Benjamin. Only one, Enrico Caruso Jr., attempted a career as a
singer. All are deceased.

DIALLO CASE IS SENT TO ALBANY, WHERE JURIES ARE FRIENDLIER TO
POLICE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The Bronx will never be confused with Albany
County, a place where cornfields and deer are more common sights
than body shops, and their differences could have a profound effect
on the Amadou Diallo shooting case, sent here by an appellate court
order on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The court dropped the case into a place where the jury pool is
overwhelmingly white and inclined to accept the police version of
events. Albany County's prosecutors have one of the highest
conviction rates in the state, but in criminal cases against police
officers, the defendants usually walk free.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few similarities is that the city of Albany is roiled
on occasion by racial resentment, often aimed at the police. But
even those passions are different in quality and in kind from
tensions in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The black community is concentrated in a handful of tumbledown
neighborhoods in this city of 94,000 people. The county's white
majority is largely middle-class, lives mostly in quiet suburbs and
small towns and is largely oblivious to the hostility in minority
communities.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court
granted a change of venue to the four white New York City officers
charged with murdering Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, on
Feb. 4 in the the Bronx. The defense contends the officers thought
Diallo was armed, and only shot in the belief that he was reaching
for a gun. In seeking to move the case, the lawyers argued that the
shooting's intense publicity would prevent a fair hearing in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, when police officers here have been accused of
misconduct, they have been acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a defense lawyer, I don't think I could pick a
better spot than Albany County to present a case'' like the Diallo
case, said Terence L. Kindlon, a lawyer who has tried several
lawsuits against the police here. In one high-profile case, two
white Albany officers were acquitted in March of beating a
handcuffed black college student, Jermaine Henderson, in a police
station garage. Critics accused the district attorney of sabotaging
the prosecution by refusing to grant immunity to the student for a
fight that had led to his arrest. The student did not testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been very few convictions at trial of police
officers in Albany County in my 30 years of practicing law,'' said
the special prosecutor, John E. Dorfman, a lawyer in private
practice. ``Quite honestly, I can only recall one.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Wiest, chief assistant district attorney, agreed with
Kindlon that this is a place where people trust authority, a marked
contrast to the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, state police, when they were chasing someone, would
try to catch them in Albany County, because they were so sure of
the conviction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In one recent case, an Albany detective charged with stealing
cocaine from a drug arrest was acquitted of most charges and the
jury deadlocked on the last count. That charge was later
plea-bargained to a misdemeanor, and the detective served no prison
time. But when officers have not been the defendants, convictions
have been easier. Year after year, Albany County has one of the
state's highest conviction rates and the Bronx has one of the
lowest, according to state data. Many black people here say they
are treated callously by the police, a view that was reinforced by
the Henderson case and by the tactics the police used last month in
searching for a black man accused of wounding two officers. A large
police contingent swept through the mostly black Arbor Hill
neighborhood, and there were allegations that they roughed up some
residents. The suspect remains at large.
</P>
<P>
   Local black residents still refer angrily to the death of Jessie
Davis, a schizophrenic black man who was shot by officers in his
apartment here in 1984. The officers said he had menaced them with
a knife and a large meat fork, but his family insisted that he was
unarmed. A grand jury declined to indict the officers.
</P>
<P>
   While people in Albany tended to respond hazily when asked
Friday about the Diallo case, black residents knew all about it.
``Most people of color know about Diallo because it's such an
injustice,'' said Gloria Reese, 54, the black owner of a hair salon
in Arbor Hill.
</P>
<P>
   White people were more detached about the case. ``I don't think
it affects people one way or the other,'' said Lon Palatsky, 36, a
white computer technician who works for the state. ``New York City
is like another state _ we're far removed from them.''

 &HT;    Bradley, Gore civil in meeting that highlights candidates'
differences
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ Vice President Al Gore and rival Bill Bradley
steered the high road Friday in a town hall meeting here, drawing
more contrasts between themselves and the Republican presidential
candidates than each other.
</P>
<P>
   Both men outlined plans for an activist government that would
seek to tackle and solve some of the nation's biggest problems,
such as providing health insurance to the 44 million uninsured and
providing for the safety of children in school.
</P>
<P>
   The 90 minute exchange between Gore and Bradley before New
Hampshire voters contrasted sharply with the sometimes testy
rhetoric that has characterized their back and forth over the past
few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect Senator Bradley,'' Gore said. ``As Democrats, we do
have an awful lot in common. We've been friends, former colleagues.
I think he's a good man. I think he's a good man with some bad
plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley offered no such glowing endorsement of Gore, but he also
steered clear of negative attacks. He said his presidency would
provide a ``different style'' of leadership, one that offered bold
positions on complex problems.
</P>
<P>
   The town hall took place at Daniel Webster College before an
audience of 200 New Hampshire voters. It was broadcast live in New
Hampshire and rebroadcast nationally on ABC News's ``Nightline.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC anchor Ted Koppel moderated the event, which featured Gore
and Bradley seated on stools in the center of an auditorium and
surrounded by the audience on all sides.
</P>
<P>
   Both men appeared relaxed throughout the event, only the second
town hall meeting of the campaign. The two will meet again Sunday
on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' in more of a debate format.
</P>
<P>
   They remained mostly civil toward one another, but engaged in
about 10 minutes of what Koppel called ``squabbling'' over their
respective health care plans.
</P>
<P>
   Gore noted that he planned to devote 15 percent of the budget
surplus to Medicare, the government insurance program for the
elderly. He challenged Bradley to say how he would ensure the
program's solvency. Bradley, insisting Medicare was secure until
2017, challenged Gore to explain who he would ``leave out'' of his
health care plan.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's health care plan aims to cover 95 percent of the
uninsured, while Gore has proposed a more graduated approach that
focuses first on insuring poor children.
</P>
<P>
   They also clashed over education, with Gore referring several
times to his $115 billion plan to pump new federal money into
pre-school education, teacher salary increases and special
education. Gore called the plan ``revolutionary'' and accused
Bradley of failing to address education.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley responded by ticking off the investments he would make:
doubling the size of Head Start, providing incentives to attract
teachers to disadvantaged areas, and new money for child care
centers.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley and Gore also agreed on a wide range of issues.
</P>
<P>
   They supported placing more counselors in schools to deal with
teen violence, strong gun control and greater restraint from media
companies who broadcast violent and sexually explicit programs.
</P>
<P>
   They each declined to commit to a specific date when the United
States should seek to land an astronaut on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   They also agreed on enacting a patients bill of rights to put
doctors in charge of health care decisions. And each claimed he had
the experience to enact such legislation in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Gore cited his 16 years in Congress and asserted that he had
``excellent relations'' with the lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley cited his 18 years in the Senate and pointed to his
stewardship of the 1986 Tax Reform Act, which eliminated loopholes
and lowered rates, as proof that he could negotiate big legislation
through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the questions elicited strong differences between the
two men and the field of Republicans seeking the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question about Jesus Christ, Bradley asserted
that religion was a private matter and he had made a decision not
to discuss his religious views. Gore said he strongly supported the
separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   The responses were in marked contrast to a similar question that
was posed of the Republican candidates at a forum in Iowa last
week, during which each affirmed his personal faith in Christ.
</P>
<P>
   The campus here in this southern New Hampshire town resembled a
giant campaign rally for both candidates. Legions of supporters for
the two men paraded around the grounds in frosty temperatures
chanting their candidate's name.
</P>
<P>
   As he has done at previous appearances with Bradley, Gore also
littered the grounds with Gore 2000 posters, even encouraging some
of the surrounding homes to put up flashing, white holiday lights
spelling out ``Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also attempted to generate some bad news for Bradley,
flying Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) in to watch the debate and
publicizing the senator's endorsement of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg, who served with Bradley 14 years, endorsed Gore
before Bradley became a candidate, but he said if he had known his
former colleague was going to jump in the race he still would have
endorsed Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I frankly think Al Gore has experience that is unmatchable,''
Lautenberg said before the meeting began.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Hauser, Bradley's spokesman, dismissed the endorsement as
``old news.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another example of taking credit for something that's
already happened,'' Hauser said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also imported a few supporters, including former White
House special counsel Archibald Cox, who investigated Watergate,
and Harvard scholar Cornell West.

JAIL STANDOFF A PRODUCT OF CUBAN DETAINEES' LEGAL LIMBO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ARMANDO VILLAFRANCA 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. MARTINVILLE, La. _ Eight years have passed since the last
desperate cry from Cubans held indefinitely in U.S. detention
facilities as undesirables.
</P>
<P>
   But the message, this time from a handful of Cubans holding
hostages in a small parish jail, is much the same _ they want
release from an immigration limbo that without a shift in
U.S.-Cuban relations, they may never escape.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the pleas carried a seething urgency. In Oakdale, La.,
water jets could not check 1,000 Cubans who rioted, took 28
hostages and burned down four prison buildings. And the same year,
1,400 Cubans killed a guard at an Atlanta prison and took 89
hostages. In 1991, Cubans held 10 hostages in Talladega, Ala., and
pledged death or freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Cubans at Oakdale and Atlanta who were granted review
hearings by immigration officials, the Cubans at St. Martinville
have had their hearings and lost.
</P>
<P>
   Their fate is simple, because of crimes they have committed in
the United States. Either Cuba will take them back, which is
unlikely because no deportation agreement exists between the
countries, or they will remain behind bars, indefinitely, awaiting
deportation.
</P>
<P>
   Their demand, since taking hostage two deputies and the warden
Monday, has been for freedom. They will go anywhere, they said.
</P>
<P>
   But overnight Thursday, two hostage-takers surrendered and one
deputy was released. By late Friday, other inmates in the jail and
all of the facility except the warden's office were back in police
control.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said six hostage-takers remained and were holding
Warden Todd Louvierre and Deputy Jolie Sonnier along with five
inmates, all women, in the warden's office. No injuries have been
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The hostage-takers at St. Martinville are among 2,400 Cubans who
have lost their temporary residency status in the United States
because they were convicted of crimes. Of the 2,400, 1,750 were
among an estimated 125,000 Cubans who came to the United States in
the 1980 Mariel boat lift, the mass emigration from Cuba allowed by
President Fidel Castro that was found to include convicts and some
mental patients. Most of the Marielitos settled into their newfound
freedom without incident and joined American society. The same
cannot be said of the 2,400 Cubans still in detention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority probably have, for the most part, been
involved in criminal activity here in the United States almost
since they day they arrived, and because of that they're prohibited
from naturalization,'' said Russ Bergeron, U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the law these people are deportable,'' Bergeron said.
``This isn't some arbitrary decision made by the INS. The reason
they're not being deported is because Castro won't take them and no
one else will have them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said most of the current Cuban detainees were granted
humanitarian parole after their arrival and released from INS
custody. But their criminal convictions stripped them of their
legal residency status and ended their chances of becoming
naturalized citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of Cuban detainees have contended, however, that
keeping Cubans behind bars indefinitely is inhumane and deprives
them of their human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Leshaw, an Atlanta attorney credited with getting Cubans at
the Atlanta prison to accept a compromise that ended that standoff,
said incidents like those at St. Martinville continue to erupt
because of immigration laws that leave the government with only two
options in dealing with undesirable immigrants: deportation or
detention if deportation is not possible.
</P>
<P>
   He said many of the Cubans in jails have served their sentences
for their criminal convictions but remain in prison because the
government does not know what to do with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who are, for legal purposes, not here. And
because they are not here, they don't have any rights. That's the
course the government has followed,'' Leshaw said. ``That's the
flaw in the policy: (The INS says), `You don't have any rights;
that's just too bad.'''
</P>
<P>
   The end result, he said, is that the Cubans ``just kind of sit
indefinitely'' in prisons. And because the Cubans have no
constituency, they are left to languish in prison cells until they
take action to force the issue.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Cubans, out of frustration, take desperate measures.
Taking hostages is the only way they can get their cause heard.
</P>
<P>
   Leshaw described their state of mind this way, ``Can you skin
the hide of a man who has already been skinned?''
</P>
<P>
   But even Leshaw concedes the Cubans have little of hope being
released. In the 1980s, thousands of Cubans were being held
awaiting immigration hearings to determine their residency status.
The same cannot be said 20 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Every Cuban currently in jails has had his case reviewed. A
major point in reaching the compromise that resulted in the release
of the hostages at Oakdale and Atlanta was an assurance that every
Cuban in detention would receive a review hearing. Of the estimated
3,800 Cubans in detention in 1987, more than 2,000 were eventually
released.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, he said, all legal remedies for the remaining
Cubans have been exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   The 1987 riots also changed the way the INS detained Cubans. The
1,000 Cubans held at Oakdale, out of necessity because of the fire,
were scattered to prisons elsewhere, as were the 1,400 at Atlanta.
In an effort to minimize security and safety problems, the INS no
longer holds Cuban detainees in large concentrations.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Mariel boat lift and before the 1987 riots, the United
States had succeeded in persuading Cuban President Fidel Castro to
take back 2,746 Cubans considered undesirable by the United States.
In 1985, after agreeing to take back 201 more Cubans, Castro
withdrew from the agreement as a protest of Radio Marti, a U.S.
government-supported radio station with anti-Castro programming.
Castro later agreed to accept 2,500 Cuban detainees, which led to
the 1987 riots.
</P>
<P>
   Since the boat lift, Bergeron said, the INS has released more
than 6,000 Mariel Cubans with criminal background. He said the INS
will release Cubans convicted of crimes in the United States if
they demonstrate that they will not pose a public threat if freed.
</P>
<P>
   He counters the argument that detainees are being denied their
human rights by saying that the victims of crimes also have rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advocacy without responsibility rings hollow,'' he said.
``Those who would call for the release of these people do not have
to face the next rape victim, look into her eyes and explain why
this person was released. We do.''
</P>
<P>
   After holding the parish jail warden and two guards hostage for
three days, the Cuban detainees requested that the media be part of
the negotiations and allowed their captives to speak to their
neighbors through a public address system.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of supporters recently started holding a vigil across
from the courthouse, but most in town just drive by slowly to crane
their necks at the commotion.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Melancon, 65, found himself sympathetic to the Cuban
cause, but with caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they ought give them back their freedom,'' he said as
he stood behind the storefront window of an auto parts and hardware
store. ``Not here, but somewhere else.''

EX-EDS EMPLOYEES ACCUSED OF FRAUD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Del., Mass., Texas)  (mk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nine former employees of Electronic Data Systems Corp. were
arrested Friday and charged with conspiring to defraud the states
of New York, Delaware and Massachusetts of $37.9 million in cash
and other assets that had been abandoned by customers of brokerage
houses.
</P>
<P>
   A complaint unsealed in Manhattan said the nine employees of the
Texas-based computer services and data processing company had
worked in a New York division of EDS that specialized in helping
clients recover money that had been turned over, or escheated, to
states as abandoned property.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, banks and brokerage firms must turn over the
assets of dormant accounts to states after a specified number of
years. If the owners are later identified and found, the money may
be reclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   In return for assisting companies in that process, the EDS unit,
called the Asset Research and Recovery division, received 30
percent of any recoveries that it made.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said in the complaint filed in
U.S. District Court in Manhattan that from 1995 until early this
year, the chief of the asset recovery unit, Victor Lugo, and eight
other employees had submitted fraudulent claims on behalf of
brokerage houses that had hired EDS to recover such assets.
</P>
<P>
   For example, prosecutors said, EDS had obtained through bogus
filings $16 million that had been turned over to Delaware by
Kidder, Peabody &AMP; Co., a subsidiary of General Electric. EDS
received about 30 percent of the total, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the employees made fraudulent claims for $15
million on behalf of Cigna Investments Inc., the complaint said. To
date, New York has paid back about $3.8 million, with EDS receiving
about $1.1 million in fees. A spokesman for Cigna did not return a
call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Massachusetts, the complaint charged that the EDS
employees obtained $6.9 million through fraudulent means _ with
about 30 percent going to EDS _ on behalf of General Electric
Investment Corp., also a subsidiary of GE.
</P>
<P>
   A GE official said that the company was cooperating with the
authorities in both cases involving its units. All nine employees
have been fired or disciplined or have resigned, EDS said. James
Daley, EDS' chief financial officer, said in a phone interview that
EDS, which is based in Plano, Texas, had agreed to repay the money
that had been fraudulently obtained. ``The amounts in the aggregate
are not material to EDS' operations or financial position,'' the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint says that EDS detected the fraud after its
auditors uncovered a ``variety of unlawful conduct'' at Global
Financial Markets Group, an EDS office in New York of which the
assets recovery division is a part.
</P>
<P>
   The illegal conduct included expense account fraud, kickbacks
from vendors and accounting irregularities ``that enriched various
employees'' at the expense of EDS, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   Further investigation by EDS uncovered the fraud scheme, the
complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found it,'' Daley said. ``We turned it over.'' He said the
company's intention was ``to do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The complaint accuses one of the defendants, Lugo, 54, of Coram,
N.Y., of directing the unit to ``create bogus documents and take
other improper steps to convince states that various escheated
funds belonged to clients of EDS when, in truth and in fact, the
funds did not.'' Lugo ``directed other EDS employees to cut
information from certain documents, paste it into other documents,
and photocopy the resulting documents to conceal the alterations,''
said the 11-page complaint, which was signed by an FBI agent,
Kathleen Diskin.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Lugo, James Sherwood, said that his client will
enter a not-guilty plea, and ``intends to contest the charges
vigorously.''

USC PUZZLED AFTER POOR EFFORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's 10 games into the season, but there's
probably less answers today than a month ago about the USC
basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   At least four weeks ago, USC earned a measure of respect by
playing hard in its loss to North Carolina at the Maui
Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   But after losing to Long Beach State 76-66 on Thursday night at
the Pyramid, the Trojans (5-5) seemed completely befuddled over
their performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we didn't want to win,'' USC coach Henry Bibby said.
``You think you can come in and just show up. I don't have any
excuses for this. It was incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Some USC players, notably starters Jeff Trepagnier and David
Bluthenthal, were bothered by the flu this week, but it was hardly
enough to explain the listless way the Trojans played in the second
half, when they shot 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed this game. We couldn't afford to lose this one,''
forward Sam Clancy said. ``We shouldn't have lost this one. They
just wanted it more than we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more troubling than a single loss, the game demonstrated
how ineffective the Trojans are when one of their top players
struggles. Forward Brian Scalabrine, who averages nearly 17 points
per game, scored only four against Long Beach and fouled out after
27 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   He also had six turnovers, and has a team-high 43 this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole night he was in foul trouble and in and out of the
game,'' Clancy said. ``I think it threw him off his game.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem area is free throws. USC made 15 of 24 attempts
and was 11 of 19 in the second half. The Trojans are shooting just
63 percent on free throws this season.
</P>
<P>
   Even without Scalabrine contributing and its free-throw misery,
USC was only down 68-66 to the 49ers with 1:36 remaining. But the
Trojans failed to score the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a loss and you've got to evaluate why we didn't play,''
Bibby said. ``That's the difference. It's more what we did than
what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was also a setback for USC's bench, which Bibby almost
ignored. Center Kostas Charissis and point guards Rashad Jones and
Sandy Fletcher all played one minute. Only freshman shooting guard
Nate Hair, who replaced Scalabrine, saw significant minutes (13).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Clancy had his fourth double-double of the year, with 19
points and 11 rebounds against Long Beach State. Bluthenthal had
career highs in minutes (40) and points (19) in the contest.
Trepagnier had three steals to move into third place on USC's
all-time steals list with 116.

UCLA: OLD DEMONS TO BLUE DEMONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Add Gonzaga to an infamous list that includes
Kansas, Stanford, North Carolina and Duke _ teams that have
humiliated UCLA during the Steve Lavin tenure.
</P>
<P>
   While the Bruins haven't learned to consistently attack a zone
defense under Lavin, they have shown remarkable resiliency _ or
very short memories _ following embarrassing defeats.
</P>
<P>
   That's the challenge again today, when the Bruins face No. 19
DePaul at Pauley Pavilion a week after their pathetic performance
against Gonzaga.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to flush that loss and get ready for DePaul,''
forward Rico Hines said. ``Nobody has dwelled on it. That's a sign
of a mature team.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavin's approach this week was no different than after other bad
losses. Time and again, he urged the Bruins to keep perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them the season's a marathon, not a sprint,'' he said.
``I think it'd be a mistake to overreact to Gonzaga. I think it'd
be a mistake to suddenly think this is a terrible team.''
</P>
<P>
   Rush update: His exams completed, suspended forward JaRon Rush
went home for the holidays Friday. He'll spend at least the next
week in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sooner he gets legal counsel and takes care of business,
the better for him,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   Rush probably will return to practice following Christmas,
although an exact date has not been determined. School officials
said the move doesn't necessarily indicate Rush will be cleared of
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Athletic director) Pete (Dalis) thought it was a logical
process,'' UCLA media relations director Marc Dellins said. ``(Rush
would) take care of school, be home for Christmas, and when he
returns, they'd discuss the possibility of practicing again.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes update: Forward Matt Barnes, academically ineligible for
the fall quarter, must pass four classes for reinstatement. His
last exam was Friday, and grades have to be posted before he's
cleared. That could happen by tipoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten two grades, and they were good,'' Barnes said. ``I
talked to the (teaching assistant) of the test I took (Friday), and
she said she'd e-mail it by 1. I'm shooting to play. The teachers
are going out of their way to help me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins depart Sunday for a three-game tournament in Hawaii.
If the situation is resolved Monday, Barnes probably will hop a
plane and join the Bruins for their first game, Tuesday against
Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Roster update: Desperate for big men, the Bruins have added
Brandon Brooks, a 6-foot-6, 225-pound freshman who's the starting
goalie on UCLA's NCAA championship water polo team. A Honolulu
native, he was Hawaii's Mr. Basketball last year.
</P>
<P>
   Starting center Dan Gadzuric practiced sparingly this week
because of the flu. He'll play today but probably won't be at full
strength.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve forward Sean Farnham strained a ligament in his left
knee Tuesday. An MRI exam was negative, and he's expected to play.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve guard Ryan Bailey, who missed the Gonzaga game with
tendinitis in his foot, will play.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Earl Watson and forward Rico Hines were involved in a
minor car accident Thursday night. Neither was hurt seriously, and
they practiced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   DePaul update: The Blue Demons will have super sophomore forward
Lance Williams available today for the first time this season.
Williams, who averaged 14 points and eight rebounds last year,
broke his foot Oct. 17 but returned to practice this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned about his weight,'' DePaul coach Pat Kennedy
said. ``He's lost 8-10 pounds. But he may get some minutes against
UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   Fire sale: UCLA will hold its bi-annual apparel sale today at 1
p.m. on the east side of Pauley Pavilion. Sweats, game uniforms and
practice jerseys are some of the items available on a first-come,
first-serve basis.

   Katy happy for chance to play
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By BRIAN McTAGGART &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Katy will take the field today at the Astrodome, which should at
least provide the Tigers with some sort of moral victory heading
into the Class 5A Division II championship game.
</P>
<P>
   It was one year ago today the Tigers had their hearts ripped out
when they learned a little more than 24 hours before kickoff that
they would have to forfeit their spot in the Division I title game
for using an ineligible player.
</P>
<P>
   All season long, Katy players and coaches have talked about
nothing else except wanting a chance to redeem themselves with
another shot at a state championship. The Tigers (14-1) will get it
against upset-minded Garland (14-1) at 12:07 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought about it a lot,'' Katy senior center Brian Mosley
said. ``What happened last year was real bad, but we wanted to get
back for those seniors from last year. But this is also for us,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Garland, which has won 14 in a row, including upsets of
perennial state powers Austin Westlake, Plano East and South Grand
Prairie the last three weeks, will be making its first state-title
game appearance since winning back-to-back titles in 1963-64.
</P>
<P>
   Katy, meanwhile, won the Division I state title in 1997 after
losing in the Division I final in 1994 and winning the Class A
championship in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel confident from the point that a bunch of us guys have
been here before and we know what to expect, and Garland really
hasn't,'' Tigers junior quarterback Jared Kaspar said.
</P>
<P>
   Led by tailback Keith Mills (36 catches, 616 yards) and fullback
Donte Hart (1,879 yards rushing, 31 touchdowns), the Owls have
relied on their wing-T running formation to average 373.8 yards and
35.1 points per game. Garland amasses 281.3 yards per game on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Hart has the Garland ISD record for rushing yards in a season,
breaking Bobby Boyd's 44-year-old record. He has 413 yards rushing
the last two weeks. Hart has almost as many touchdowns during the
playoffs (13) as he did in the regular season (18).
</P>
<P>
   ``They will go to him when they have to have him,'' Johnston
said. ``He's got some wheels and runs with great lean and uses his
shoulders well.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the Owls have allowed 219.2 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt they're a solid outfit,'' Katy coach Mike
Johnston said. ``Watching them on video they remind me of the
Temple teams in the '70s. I've never seen a precision wing-T
offense like Temple with (coach) Bob McQueen. But Garland has a lot
of that same look.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston compared Garland's offensive line to Katy's massive
bunch from two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The line up there creates a new line of scrimmage every time
the ball is snapped,'' he said. ``Our defensive front seven will
certainly get challenged. It's going to be a physical game. I think
you're going to see chin straps, snaps, buckles and jaw pads all
over the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers, who come in averaging 348.6 yards and 31.7 points
per game with their ball-control offense, have struggled in first
half in recent weeks due to nerves.
</P>
<P>
   But Katy has managed to shine in the second half, partly because
of a defense that has produced a plus-15 turnover ratio.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the determination of trying to erase last year's
bitter disappointment, the Tigers have other intangibles pointing
in their favor. This will be Katy's 16th playoff game in the last
three years and it will be in the Astrodome, where it has played
numerous times in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having them come to Houston is going to put them a little but
out of synch and hopefully these things will work to our
advantage,'' Johnston said. ``The way all these things have
evolved, I feel real good about our chances.''
</P>
<P>
   And a chance is all the Tigers wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited more than confident,'' said Katy senior safety
Robby McDaniel, who will start his 46th consecutive game. ``We've
waited so long for it to be our senior year. We've gone through all
the bumps and bruises and sweat and blood and tears. So we figure
it's our turn and we're going to give it all we've got.''

EXPLOSIVES-ARIZ _ Federal agents searched a remote mining camp
southwest of Flagstaff on Friday, looking for clues to the theft of
nearly 1,000 pounds of explosives and questioning workers with
access to the locked area where the missing materials were stored.
Authorities said 750 pounds of fuel-soaked ammonium nitrate, 250
pounds of dynamite; 6,000 feet of detonation cord and about 20
blasting caps were stolen after 5 p.m. Monday from the 3 Wins
Mining Co. camp near the tiny community of Drake. The materials all
are commonly used in mining, authorities said, but they also can be
used to make a bomb. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
GIRL-RESCUE _ When a thief drove off and then ditched a
sport-utility vehicle with Clarissa Quihuis still inside, destiny
called. And the 5-year-old answered. Clarissa picked up her
mother's cell phone when it rang and calmly gave detectives details
about where she was _ right down to the street numbers on nearby
houses. She also followed the advice to keep honking the horn,
which helped bring Friday's harrowing ride from Tempe to Phoenix to
a quick, happy end. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
GM-VERDICT _ A Maricopa County jury ordered General Motors to pay
$14.2 million to the family of a Scottsdale woman who was run over
when her GM pickup truck lurched into reverse. The jury found the
automobile giant negligent and said it should have warned drivers
of the potential transmission problem it reportedly knew about
since the late 1960s _ decades before Ruth Golonka, 67, was killed.
Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SUPREMACIST _ A member of Gilbert's ``Devil Dogs'' White
supremacist gang had some powerful people standing up for him
before he was sentenced in the gang beating of strangers who were
taunted with shouts of ``White power.'' The town's former mayor
sent the judge a letter to vouch for Glenn Cribbin's character, and
a high school athletic director testified in an attempt to spare
his former wrestling star from jail. Story will move in the ``A''
category. &QL;

   SEATTLE _ A man who officials said brought a car with a trunk
full of bomb-making materials on a ferry from Canada, and then led
customs officials on a foot chase through the streets of a
Washington port town, was arrested by federal authorities, who said
Friday that his target, his motives and his background remained a
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The man, who had more than 150 pounds of bomb-making chemicals
and detonator components in the car, was detained Tuesday just
after driving off a ferry from Victoria, British Columbia, in Port
Angeles, Wash. He had a reservation for a downtown Seattle motel
Tuesday night and also had reserved tickets to fly Wednesday from
Seattle to New York and to connect from there to a London-bound
flight, federal authorities said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and the CIA are investigating the incident, a government
official said Friday. How and when the man planned to use the
materials in his car are just two of the numerous questions
surrounding the incident. Although, as one government official said
Friday: ``There's nothing mysterious at all about what was in that
car. It was stuff for a bomb, a powerful bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said the man's actions, use of fake
identification and background fueled suspicions that he could be
part of an international terrorist network.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said they believe the man is Algerian, is 28 years
old and that his name is Ahmed Ressam. They say he arrived in Los
Angeles on Feb. 7 on a flight from Seoul, South Korea, and that he
was next seen in Vancouver, British Columbia, in October. They said
his passport, which listed his name as Benni Noris and gave his age
as 28, was false. The officials also believe that both of the
Canadian driver's licenses, bearing his picture, that he was
carrying were falsely obtained. One was under the name of Benni
Antoine Noris
</P>
<P>
   The suspect was carrying maps of Washington, Oregon and
California in the car with him, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 4 p.m. Friday, a slight man with short black hair
dressed in a blue button-down shirt, black pants and jail booties
was led into a federal courtroom here. In court papers federal
prosecutors indicated that he would be charged, under the name of
Ahmed Ressam, with illegally transporting explosive material into
the country, making false statements on his customs forms and
carrying false indentification. A court interpreter spoke to him in
Arabic, and an arraignment was scheduled for Wednesday. Ressam, who
officials said also spoke French, did not speak, and the two public
defenders who appeared with him did not speak to reporters
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest comes after a recent State Department warning that it
had received ``credible information'' about plans for terrorist
attacks against U.S. citizens around the time of the Jan. 1
millennium celebration. The department's ``worldwide terrorism
warning'' advised Americans to stay away from ``large gatherings
and celebrations'' throughout the world for the rest of this year,
but it did not specify any groups planning attacks or state where
such attacks might occur.
</P>
<P>
   Two federal officials in Washington said Friday that the CIA had
been called in on the case. One of them said the intelligence
service was asked to join the case because of suspicions that the
man may be tied to terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The incident in Washington state began on Tuesday when the man
drove off the ferry from Victoria, said Pat Jones, a spokesman for
the Customs Service. An inspector started asking him routine
questions and, noting that he appeared very nervous, she soon asked
him to step out of the car.
</P>
<P>
   The man initially refused, Jones said, causing the inspector to
call for back-up. The man then got out of his car and ran away,
stopping in a brief and unsuccessful effort to commandeer a passing
car, then, a few blocks later, to hide under a truck. He was caught
about six blocks from the Port Angeles ferry terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Several plastic garbage bags containing more than 130 pounds of
two kinds of powder, later identified by the Washington state
police crime laboratory as urea and sulfate, as well as two jars of
a yellowish liquid found to be nitroglycerine, were found in the
trunk of the car, in the spare tire compartment.
</P>
<P>
   The car also contained four black boxes, each with a circuit
board connected to a Casio watch and a 9-volt battery, apparently
to be used as timing devices, a government official said.
</P>
<P>
   Urea and nitroglycerine were two of the main ingredients in the
bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Urea is a chemical sold for melting ice and is used in
fertilizer. It takes more technical skill to make it into a bomb
than was employed by the two Americans who killed 168 people in
Oklahoma City in 1995 with a huge but crude bomb made of fuel oil
and fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   The World Trade Center bomb, organized by Islamic radicals, was
built with a main charge of urea nitrate _ a combination of 1,200
pounds of urea and about 105 gallons of nitric acid, a chemical
widely used in industrial etching _ and a booster made of
nitroglycerine.
</P>
<P>
   The motel where Ressam made a reservation is a few blocks from
the Seattle Center, a complex of public buildings, including the
Space Needle, that is to be the site of New Year's Eve
celebrations.

MISSING LINK FOR THE DALLAS STARS IS `YEAR-RAY'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's funny how these things work out. Like with the case of a
local Big Four team, which just happens to be the one wearing shiny
new world championship rings.
</P>
<P>
   Such jewelry has become scarce around here, so the process of
elimination quickly identifies our subject matter as the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   There was a long list of prominent heroes involved in last
season's thrilling Stanley Cup capture. These names, of course,
would include Modano, Hull, Nieuwendyk, Belfour, Hatcher, Zubov,
Carbonneau, Keane, Langenbrunner, Matvichuk ... Big-time guys, one
and all. Big-time in North Texas. Big-time across the NHL
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   But isn't it interesting that as soon as things get upside-down
this season, that as the stars of the Stars try to overcome a
disease known as Cup-itis, the rallying cry currently centers on
one name and one name only.
</P>
<P>
   ``Year-ray.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When his injury happened,'' coach Ken Hitchcock said of winger
Jere Lehtinen's broken ankle, ``there was this total negative cloud
over our team. Everybody was running around, asking, ``What are we
gonna do?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``But now his absence has gone the other way. The positive
impact has become what kind of big boost we'll have when Jere is
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Hitchcock is counting or anything, but when asked
exactly how long Lehtinen has been missing, he answered quickly _
``eight weeks today.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Lehtinen, the Stars have struggled with many of the
intangibles _ intensity, motivation, and the most disappointing,
work ethic. Not that Lehtinen would have solved all that, but a few
more goals from Jere's No. 1 linemates, Brett Hull and Mike Modano,
might have made things smoother in the first three months of the
NHL season.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, Hull and particularly Modano, are different
players without Lehtinen's contributions. ``Different'' in a
negative way.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Lehtinen's presence has not exactly gone unnoticed in
the past. He is, after all, a two-time winner of the NHL's Selke
Trophy, which Stars announcer Daryl Reaugh believes is a much
higher standard than just best defensive forward in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of the top goalie,'' said Reaugh, himself a former NHL
goalie, ``the Selke winner is usually the overall best player.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings up another point. Does Lehtinen's absence, combined
with the troubles of the Stars, allow us to once-and-for-all finger
the Stars' team MVP? And his name is ``Year-ray.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't just think Lehtinen is the best player on the Stars,''
Reaugh said. ``He's the best player in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   A very strong compliment, and one that Hitchcock hedges on.
``Comparisons like that are difficult, almost impossible,'' he
said. ``How does Jere stack up against a \RJaromir\S Jagr, for
instance? It's two totally different types of talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for our style of play as a team, meaning everything we
want to do at both ends of the ice, Jere is the perfect fit _ very,
very valuable. Jere is a sweeper on the ice ... he sweeps up our
mistakes, which prevents goals, and he sweeps up the other team's
mistakes, which creates goals.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there's also Modano, who has never
hesitated over the years to tell the world how much Lehtinen's
presence means to his game. But in Jere's absence, the media, the
fans, and even Hitchcock, are constantly telling Modano his game
has not been dominant.
</P>
<P>
   But give it a week, and will that change when a certain missing
piece returns? Hitchcock could have gambled on Lehtinen's ankle
being healed, and pushed his return to action for this current road
trip, which ends Thursday night in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   But a week ago, there was a setback as pain in the right ankle
intensified when Lehtinen stepped up his workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I think it's important that we get it exactly right before
Jere comes back,'' said Hitchcock, who obviously wants that return
to be a team motivational tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been frustration for the players, for me, for the
fans, for everybody,'' Hitchcock said. ``But you can see it turning
back around now. We are not the best team in the National Hockey
League by any means, but we are a team on the improve.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, in a direct reference to Lehtinen, he added, ``We have
got it on the upswing again, and we also have a big horse coming
back. In the long run, I like our chances to be even better than we
were last season.''
</P>
<P>
   A tall order, no doubt. And even a doubtful opinion at the
moment. But the rallying cry is now, ``Year-ray.''
</P>
<P>
   Give it a week, and we'll see.

   IRVING, Texas _ According to the NFL calender, the playoffs
don't start for another four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   However, the postseason urgency began in earnest last weekend
for the Cowboys (7-6), who are approaching all of their remaining
games as must-win affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The victory against the Philadelphia Eagles was just the first
round in the Cowboys' odyssey to reach the playoffs. Tomorrow's
clash with the New York Jets (5-8) at Texas Stadium is Round 2 of
four. If the Cowboys win their final three games, they are
guaranteed a playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, the Cowboys got a boost when running back Emmitt
Smith (strained groin), guard Larry Allen (sprained knee) and
center Mark Stepnoski (strained calf) were able to practice for the
first time this week.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said the status of all three players
will likely come down to game-day decisions, but said that he was
``very encouraged'' about their availability for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys trainer Jim Maurer took it a step further with Smith,
saying, ``He's done a little more every day,'' and ``Everything is
pointing toward him playing.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt that the presence of Smith, the NFL's third
all-time leading rusher, and two perennial Pro Bowl linemen in
Allen and Stepnoski are soothing.
</P>
<P>
   Also calming for the Cowboys during this pressure-filled time
are the comforts of home _ Texas Stadium, where they are unbeaten
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Safety Darren Woodson said it's why the Cowboys head into the
Jets game confident of winning back-to-back games for the first
time since starting the season 3-0 and optimistic about their
chances of finish the season on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely feels good to have a couple of more home
games,'' Woodson said. ``We've played well here. It's actually been
like that for the past couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets game is the second of two in a row at home for the
Cowboys, whose 20-10 victory Sunday against the Eagles extended
their regular-season home winning streak to eight games, including
a 6-0 mark in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys will play two of their final three at home. They
travel to New Orleans on Dec. 24 before concluding the regular
season at Texas Stadium against the Giants on Jan. 2. Their
victories at Texas Stadium this season have been by a combined
score of 164-57.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't even ask me what the difference is because I don't know
why we play so differently at home and on the road,'' Gailey said.
``I know at home, being with family and not traveling impacts the
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said the Texas Stadium crowd, which has not traditionally
offered the Cowboys the same type of rowdy home-field advantage as
other venues across the league, has been a big key for the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been more involved as of late,'' Gailey said. ``They
weren't as loud last year. That's a difference for us. It's almost
like they feel we need their help, whereas in the past the Cowboys
might have been so good that they just came to be entertained. They
are a part of it now. That's what I'm seeing and feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Cowboys know, considering their woeful 1-6 mark on the
road, is that their home prowess is the main reason they are still
in the playoff hunt. It's also what they are counting on to get
them over the hump on the road and ultimately into the playoffs.
The Cowboys are looking to go undefeated at home for the first time
since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Woodson admits the Cowboys' contrasting play at home and on the
road parallels] their inconsistent play all season. He said the key
for the Cowboys is first beating the Jets. He then hopes the team
can take the confidence they gained from a two-game winning streak
into the Christmas Eve battle with the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about building momentum and gaining confidence,''
Woodson said. ``We feel good about the Jets game because it's at
home. If we can win this game and take that into New Orleans and
then come home and play at the season against the Giants. That's
what we've got to do. It all starts with winning.''
</P>
<P>
   At home. Briefly Deion Sanders continues to be slowed by
flu-like symptoms. However, he did practice yesterday and is slated
to play three positions against the Jets _ wide receiver,
cornerback and punt returner. Chan Gailey said he is thankful
Sanders didn't come down with the flu later in the week, because he
might not have been able to play against the Jets at all. Gailey
also remains fearful that more players might contract the illness
before tomorrow's game], considering that it has gone ``around the
locker room'' through several players in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys receiver Ernie Mills (strained quadriceps) has been
ruled out of Sunday's game. He will be replaced by former TCU
standout Jason Tucker, who will be making his second career start.

AFTER NINTH DELAY, NASA TO TRY AGAIN WITH SHUTTLE LAUNCH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Foul weather thwarted efforts to launch
the shuttle Discovery late Friday on a mission to repair the Hubble
Space Telescope, leaving NASA few opportunities to begin the
much-delayed flight before year's end.
</P>
<P>
   If Discovery does not lift off Saturday, or perhaps Sunday, the
mission to restore the telescope's pointing system will be reset
for mid-January. Forecasters promised only a slight improvement in
weather conditions for Saturday's attempt at 8:21 p.m. EST. NASA's
associate administrator for spaceflight, Joe Rothenberg, said late
Friday there was a possibility of a Sunday attempt, but no decision
had been made.
</P>
<P>
   Though the targeted liftoff date has shifted nine times during
the past two months, Friday's was the first in which astronauts
Curt Brown, Scott Kelly, Jean Francois Clervoy, Steve Smith, Mike
Foale, John Grunsfeld and Claude Nicollier had seated themselves in
Discovery's cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   The seven men have been largely sequestered in their quarters at
the Kennedy Space Center since Dec. 6.
</P>
<P>
   An overcast sky with steady rain and winds produced by a
sluggish cold front refused to clear before Friday's 46-minute
launch period expired.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency's desire to avoid a potential Y2K computer
problem is driving future launch options.
</P>
<P>
   NASA wants Discovery back on Earth by Dec. 28 so that it can
prepare computers at mission control facilities at the Johnson
Space Center in Houston and the Kennedy Space Center launch complex
in Florida for the New Year. As a precaution, it has also ruled out
flying over New Year's Eve to avoid a problem, though its experts
believe there is little likelihood of computer difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   With Friday's launch scrub, Discovery's flight was scaled back
from nine to eight days and the number of spacewalks from four to
three. Even with the abbreviated flight, Discovery's astronauts can
accomplish the mission's highest priority, replacement of the
telescope's six gyroscopes, and make other improvements, said Ron
Dittemore, NASA's shuttle program manager.
</P>
<P>
   One of the world's premier astronomical observatories, the space
telescope has been inactive since Nov. 13, when a fourth gyroscope
failed. A crucial component of the observatory's pointing system,
the gyroscopes enable the telescope to lock on to the celestial
targets selected by ground-based astronomers.
</P>
<P>
   NASA announced Discovery's visit to the space telescope in
March, shortly after the failure of a third gyroscope, leaving the
minimum number necessary for celestial observations. It hoped then
that the shuttle crew could reach the telescope in mid-October,
before a fourth malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   However, all shuttle flights were suspended after Columbia
experienced an electrical short moments after lifting off in late
July. The short was traced to damaged insulation on electrical
wiring in Columbia's fuselage.
</P>
<P>
   The incident prompted shuttle managers to order extensive
inspections and repairs of the wiring in Discovery, Endeavour and
Atlantis.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery completed the procedure first, but a succession of
other equipment problems accumulated to bump the targeted launch
date eight times, including Friday's first attempt to lift off.

MAN IS ARRAIGNED IN DEFACING OF PAINTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ALAN FEUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 72-year-old Manhattan man accused of smearing white
paint across a controversial painting of the Virgin Mary was
formally charged Friday and temporarily barred from the Brooklyn
Museum of Art, where the painting had ignited a cultural uproar in
September.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Dennis Heiner, was charged with criminal mischief,
making graffiti and possessing instruments of graffiti, the
Brooklyn district attorney's office said. He was released without
bail after an arraignment in the Brooklyn Criminal Court, where
Judge Lauren Bailey-Shifman ordered him to stay out of the museum
until at least his next court appearance, on Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
   The three charges against Heiner were misdemeanors. The district
attorney's office said it could not charge him with a felony
because less than $1,500 in damage was done to the painting. Heiner
remained silent throughout his brief arraignment, where he was
represented by Henry Dechalis, a court-appointed lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday afternoon, the authorities said, Heiner slipped
behind a plexiglass shield in front of the painting, ``The Holy
Virgin Mary'' by Chris Ofili, and rubbed strokes of white latex
paint across the canvas. After the attack, museum conservators
removed the painting and cleaned it before the paint even dried _
within an hour. The restored canvas was returned to the gallery
Friday, and a rope on stanchions was placed in front of its
plexiglass shield as an added precaution, said Sally Williams, a
museum spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The painting, adorned with elephant dung and pornographic
cutouts, had been singled out earlier this year as particularly
offensive by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who, along with the Catholic
League and others, protested the exhibition, ``Sensation.''
Giuliani sought to pull financing for the museum, but lost in
federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, in response to questions about whether he may have
instigated Heiner in some way, the mayor replied: ``I haven't said
anything for about a month or a month and a half. So that would be
a real stretch.'' He said Heiner should be prosecuted like anyone
else accused of such a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Heiner was described by his wife, Helena, in an interview on
Thursday as a Roman Catholic who opposed abortion and believed that
the painting was sacrilegious. In 1990, Heiner was charged with
obstructing governmental administration for protesting in front of
an abortion clinic in Westchester County, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Davitt, a spokesman for the Brooklyn district attorney's
office, said there was no indication that Heiner had any help in
the attack.

 &HT;    Poll says most people think political candidates lie
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Candidates in the 2000 election will face
increasingly skeptical voters growing less tolerant of attack ads
and dishonesty on the campaign trail, says a research group with
ties to Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   In a nationwide poll done in early November, the Institute for
Global Ethics found nearly 60 percent of those polled think all or
most candidates ``twist the truth'' while campaigning. Almost 40
percent said most candidates lie.
</P>
<P>
   The latest figures come from a group that used Ohio and
Washington as pilot states in 1998 to begin its Project on Campaign
Conduct, in which polling was combined with an effort to get
candidates to agree to codes of conduct for their campaigns. The
institute ran that project in association with the Kettering
Foundation in Dayton, and the Ray C. Bliss Institute of Applied
Politics at Akron University.
</P>
<P>
   And while Brad Rourke, a vice president with the global ethics
institute, said there's nothing remarkable about a poll showing
voters distrust politicians, he said the new data is valuable
because of the background polling done in Ohio last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's new is there's been an intensification (of those
feelings) over the last 18 months that's really surprising in
scope,'' Rourke said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Rourke said some questions asked in both polls showed more than
a 10-point change in results, which he said is significant even if
the first poll was conducted only in a state and the second poll
was done nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Rourke said that among Ohioians polled in 1998
only 40 percent believed some or all politicians ``twist the
truth'' while campaigning, compared with almost 60 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's of a scope that is notable,'' Rourke said.
</P>
<P>
   But Whitfield Ayers, a Republican pollster in Atlanta, said it's
``not valid'' to compare polling results when the samples are drawn
from different populations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say something's going up or down when you're talking
about people from two different universes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ayers agreed generally with the point of Global Ethics
that voters have grown impatient with attack ads. But he's not
convinced there's evidence voters are especially concerned this
year as opposed to previous years.
</P>
<P>
   He said polls on voter attitudes about negative ads must be
carefully crafted because it's not easy to define ``negative.'' He
said that in the coming election, as always, voters will be
sensitive to the tone of campaign attacks and are less tolerant of
personal attacks than pointed criticism of an opponent's record.
And Ayers said it's as true as ever that too strident an attack can
do more harm to the candidate making the attack than the candidate
who is the target.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question they're tired of the negativism,'' Ayers
said of voters. ``But that doesn't mean that candidates are going
to stop comparisons of one another. So it depends on how you define
an attack ad.''

NEWS ANALYSIS: THE POLITICS BEHIND A DECISION TO RAISE A TOBACCO
TAX
</HEADLINE>
   (With NY-TOBACCO-TAX) 
(rk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The 55-cent-a-pack increase in New York state's
cigarette tax agreed to Friday by Gov. George Pataki and
legislative leaders is the latest in a series of heavy blows
against the tobacco companies, an industry that just a few years
ago seemed invulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   The most glaring setback occurred in lawsuit settlements with
the states in 1998, for $246 billion over 25 years. But as
sentiment against tobacco has grown, there have been numerous other
defeats. In the last five years, the federal government and 19
states have increased their tobacco taxes.
</P>
<P>
   And this year, Philip Morris, the world's largest tobacco
company, and the New York state Legislature have been embarrassed
by disclosures that the company's chief lobbyist here violated
state law by failing to disclose meals and other gifts she bought
for dozens of legislators. Since then, lawmakers have sought ways
to cover themselves politically, helping to propel the tax
increase.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit settlements and higher taxes increase the price of
cigarettes, driving down their use. The industry reports that sales
nationally have fallen 8 to 10 percent in the last year, as
cigarette prices have risen to keep pace with the cost of the legal
settlements and higher taxes.
</P>
<P>
   A 55-cent increase would put New York's cigarette tax at $1.11 a
pack, the highest in the nation, and lawmakers say the $500 million
a year in revenue would be used to help expand health insurance for
the poor. It would be the first significant anti-smoking measure
the state has adopted since the governor took office. For Pataki, a
Republican who has built his reputation on deep tax cuts, raising
the tobacco tax is a stark departure. He acknowledged that Friday's
deal was a hard switch for him to accept, but added, ``We're not
just raising revenue, we're also saving lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The tax increase is expected to be advantageous to the governor
in New York, leavening his conservative image, and tapping into the
popularity of anti-smoking efforts and deep concern about the
uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   But it puts him at odds with Republicans in Congress, who
soundly rejected President Clinton's plan for a 50-cent increase in
the federal tobacco tax. Pataki would like to be considered for his
party's vice presidential nomination next year, but he is viewed by
many national Republicans as too moderate.
</P>
<P>
   At home, the tax gives Pataki, like the legislators, a way of
demonstrating that he is not beholden to tobacco interests.
Democrats often accuse Republicans of being too cozy with the
tobacco industry, whose campaign contributions overwhelmingly go to
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Until this decade, politicians around the country, in both
parties, were largely unwilling to challenge the tobacco industry.
But after voters approved initiatives raising the tobacco taxes in
Arizona, California and Massachusetts, legislators began to follow
their lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians have found that if you're going to raise a tax,
this is the one to raise,'' said Russell Sciandra, director of the
Center for a Tobacco-Free New York. ``There's been a tremendous
shift in public opinion against the tobacco companies.''
</P>
<P>
   When New York raised its tax in 1993, to 56 cents a pack, it
became the highest cigarette tax in the country. Now, New York
ranks 16th. The highest is $1, in Alaska and Hawaii, while the
lowest are in tobacco-growing states of Virginia and Kentucky, 2.5
cents and 3 cents, respectively. New Jersey's tax is 80 cents, and
Connecticut's is 50 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The federal cigarette tax, now 24 cents, will rise to 34 cents
on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   A 55-cent tax increase would mean an 18 percent jump in the
retail price of cigarettes, now averaging $3 a pack in New York.
Anti-smoking groups say that would drive down cigarette sales to
the state's 3 million smokers by 7 percent. ``The decline would be
almost twice as large among teen-agers and the poor,'' said Ana
Marengo, an American Cancer Society spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the tax increase, Sciandra said, ``The number of
kids who start smoking will drop by 12 percent, more than 20,000
kids a year, and it will get more than 200,000 adults to quit.''
Lawmakers say they will also increase spending on efforts to combat
smoking, to $37 million a year from about $13 million now.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco companies agree that rising prices depress demand, and
they note that cigarette sales have been declining for years. For
that reason, they maintain, higher taxes are an unwise way for
states to raise money. ``You kind of have to question the
advisability of a long-term program with a revenue source that is
declining,'' said Brendan J. McCormick, a spokesman for Philip
Morris.
</P>
<P>
   The industry also argues that reducing cigarette use will
undermine the bonds that some governments, like New York City and
Nassau County, are selling, backed by the expected
tobacco-settlement money. That is because the settlements stipulate
that lower sales will mean smaller payments to the states.
</P>
<P>
   New York accounts for less than 7 percent of the national
cigarette market, so what happens here may not affect the
industry's bottom line very much. But tobacco companies worry that
anti-smoking sentiment has become a runaway train, with New York
poised to leap to the front.
</P>
<P>
   Sure signs of that fear were on display earlier this week, when
the Legislature met for a special session. There were no
tobacco-related bills on the agenda, but everyone knew the higher
tax was under discussion.
</P>
<P>
   When Assembly Democrats finished a six-hour private meeting
Wednesday around midnight, the only people waiting for them as they
left were reporters and tobacco lobbyists. And when the Senate held
its session Tuesday, there were just four lobbyists waiting outside
the chamber. One worked for the cancer society; the three others
worked for tobacco companies.

FOR THE MILLENNIUM, A DIFFERENT DRAWING OF JESUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a way to celebrate the millennium, The National Catholic
Reporter, an independent weekly based in Kansas City, Mo., decided
earlier this year to sponsor a contest for a new artistic portrait
of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, said John L. Allen Jr., the newspaper's opinion
editor, was to put ``the focus back on Christ'' at a time when so
much news coverage about the year 2000 seemed to turn either on
apocalyptic anxiety (fear of a computer disaster) or on hedonism
(where to find the hottest New Year's Eve party).
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost seemed to have slipped off the radar screen, why we
were marking this date, 2,000 years since the birth of Christ,''
Allen said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Jesus 2000'' contest, brainchild of the newspaper's
editor, Michael Farrell, received international attention almost as
soon as it was announced. It drew 1,678 entries, from artists in 19
nations.
</P>
<P>
   This week The Reporter announced a winner, selected from among
10 finalists by the British art critic Sister Wendy Beckett. The
portrait is called ``Jesus of the People,'' and it shows a young,
dark-skinned man with subtly feminine facial features. He clutches
a robe around himself, and his head is surrounded by a halo.
</P>
<P>
   The painter, Janet McKenzie, an artist from northern Vermont, is
quoted by the newspaper as saying she used a female model, an
African-American woman, in order to incorporate women into this
image of Jesus. The paper also quotes Sister Beckett as saying she
thought the Jesus in the painting gazed back at viewers with an
``ineffable dignity, with sadness but with confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The portrait, the article about it and commentary by Sister
Beckett can all be found on the newspaper's Web site,
www.natcath.org.
</P>
<P>
   Allen said the paper had been receiving lots of comment about
Sister Beckett's choice. ``It is generating an enormous reaction,''
he said, ``both positive and negative'': While many people are
outraged at the untraditional approach the artist took, many others
feel deeply moved by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any new image of Jesus is going to generate controversy,''
Allen added.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want to see more of the entries in the contest,
the newspaper will publish a special color supplement in its Dec.
24 issue, showing the 10 paintings chosen as finalists, along with
50 others, Allen said. The paintings selected for second, third and
fourth place are also displayed on the Web site. They are
strikingly different from the winner, and from one another.
</P>
<P>
   As for whether any of the paintings will be formally exhibited
somewhere, Allen said all that was still in the talking stage. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JEWS AND BAPTISTS STILL SPLIT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to arrange a meeting between the president of the
Southern Baptist Convention and officials of a major Jewish
organization, to discuss the organization's criticism of Southern
Baptist approaches to converting Jews, have collapsed after the two
sides disagreed about who should attend.
</P>
<P>
   Gedale B. Horowitz and Michael S. Miller, president and
executive vice president of the Jewish Community Relations Council
of New York, wanted a one-on-one meeting between Horowitz and the
Rev. Paige Patterson, the convention's president. But in a letter
sent to the council last week, Patterson said he took that stance
as a rejection of his proposal that a gathering also include the
heads of four Jewish seminaries and two representatives of
``Messianic Jewish'' groups that assert that one can be Jewish and
nonetheless believe in Jesus as the Messiah.
</P>
<P>
   ``With regret,'' Patterson wrote, ``I accept your refusal of our
offer, and there the matter ends.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson and the council had exchanged letters since September,
when officials of the Jewish organization complained that Southern
Baptists were embracing ``deceptive'' proselytizing practices by
supporting Messianic groups, some of which use Jewish ritual
objects like skullcaps and prayer shawls in their religious
services while also worshiping Jesus.

 &HT;    Collins in jail on new warrant
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ Cecil Collins is back in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Dolphins running back turned himself in at the Broward
County jail after authorities in Baton Rouge, La., issued an arrest
warrant, saying he had violated terms of a four-year probation in
that state when he was arrested in Davie early Thursday morning and
charged with two counts of burglary of an occupied dwelling.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, 23, is expected to remain in the Broward County jail
until a bond hearing Monday or Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Collins had been released Thursday on $10,000 bond after a
married couple accused him of climbing through their bedroom window
at about 5:30 a.m. Ronald and Tina Nolte also told police that
Collins had been annoying Tina, 28, for the past two months,
repeatedly asking her out.
</P>
<P>
   There is the possibility that stalking charges could be added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is that _ and obviously we have to get all the
information from Florida _ but it sounds remarkably similar to the
crimes he committed here,'' Sue Bernie, the assistant district
attorney for East Baton Rouge, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie was the prosecuting attorney when Collins was arrested
twice in less than a month in 1998 and charged with breaking into
women's apartments. As part of a plea bargain, he plead guilty to
two misdemeanor counts of simple battery and two felony counts of
unauthorized entry of an inhabited dwelling. He was put on
four-year probation.
</P>
<P>
   After learning of the incident in Florida, Louisiana authorities
issued the warrant and gave Collins the choice of turning himself
in Louisiana or Broward County. He chose to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd rather have him here, able to assist us in analyzing all
of these allegations that have been made,'' said Fred Haddad,
Collins' attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney for the Noltes said their wish is simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want him to get help,'' Jim Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Collins remains on the Dolphins' roster but he is suspended
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   After practice Friday, Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson was asked if
Collins' problems would prompt him to shy away from giving players
second chances.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson paused for a couple seconds, then snapped: ``Anything
about the San Diego game?''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins will try to snap a three-game losing streak Sunday
at Pro Player Stadium against the Chargers. And at least one
observer at Friday's practice doesn't think the chaos of the week
will affect the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Wyche, a CBS analyst who will be covering the game, was the
Cincinnati Bengals coach when running back Stanley Wilson was found
in a Plantation hotel room with drugs the night before Super Bowl
XXIII. Wilson was suspended. And although the Bengals lost the game
to the 49ers, Wyche doesn't think the off-the-field problems create
much of a distraction for the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a conversation in the locker room until they get
it all out and said one time, then it's over with,'' Wyche said
after watching the end of practice Friday. ``Teams are used to
turnover. It's like a war. They're used to guys getting shot around
them and new troops coming in. That's just what football is.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyche said he empathized with the Dolphins' staff and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough on everybody because you put your eggs in certain
baskets, and when they're not their you don't know how the next
group is going to perform,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That next group will be fullback Stanley Pritchett. For the
second consecutive week, Pritchett will start at tailback.
</P>
<P>
   Last week against the Jets he started in place of the injured
J.J. Johnson and gained 68 yards on 19 carries.

ROOT FOR ST. LOUIS? IT'S A RAM TOUGH ISSUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Brett Taylor, who wore Rams pajamas as a boy _
``when they were blue and white'' _ hasn't rooted for the team
since it abandoned Southern California and he isn't about to start
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they lose every game,'' the Ojai high school teacher
said with some bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   Sal Martinez, who slept in the glow of a Rams nightlight as a
kid, never stopped being a fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tell me, `They moved away _ how can you root for them?'
'' said Martinez, owner of the memorabilia-filled Golden Ram Barber
Shop in the Orange County city of Westminster. ``I tell them, `If
your best friend moves away, do they stop being your friend?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The jilted lover. The loyal friend.
</P>
<P>
   They are the two sides of an issue that has tugged me in both
directions since the football heroes of my youth got good again
this season in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Is it OK to root for the Rams?
</P>
<P>
   Should a self-respecting Angeleno feel guilty for having a
twinge of nostalgia when the familiar gold horns show up on
magazine covers?
</P>
<P>
   Do the Rams deserve my support, after jilting their L.A. and
Anaheim fans?
</P>
<P>
   Do I deserve to enjoy their renewed success, after ignoring them
the past four years?
</P>
<P>
   These questions cannot be put off any longer.
</P>
<P>
   At 11-2, the Rams have assured a winning record (for the first
time in 10 years), clinched a division title (for the first time in
14 years) and can nail down home-field advantage throughout the NFC
postseason by beating the New York Giants on Sunday in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   They have the league's most productive offense.
</P>
<P>
   In Kurt Warner, Marshall Faulk and Isaac Bruce, they have the
No. 1 passer, No. 2 rusher and No. 3 receiver in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Darn it, they're !ital!good!off!.
</P>
<P>
   It's like tuning in the Miss America contest and there's your
ex-girlfriend in a tiara. Do you call to say congratulations?
</P>
<P>
   In the Rams' case, it's complicated.
</P>
<P>
   It's not so easy to ignore them if you grew up here, as I did in
the era of Roman Gabriel and the Fearsome Foursome, and Mom and Dad
gave you one of those blue-and-white Rams helmets for Christmas,
and you remember as if it was yesterday watching from your uncle's
20-yard-line Coliseum seats as Isiah Robertson intercepted a
Redskins pass to clinch a playoff win 25 years ago next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, rooting for the Rams means rooting for Georgia
Frontiere, the team owner who took St. Louis' money and new stadium
and tried to claim the 1995 move was ``forced upon'' her by
Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, before Frontiere moved them to Missouri, the Rams
were here for 49 years, deeper in the Southland fabric than the
Dodgers, Angels, Lakers, Kings, Clippers or Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, rooting for the Rams means rooting for John Shaw,
the team president who recently said he didn't regret the move but
did regret ``that there is no pro football in Southern
California.'' (San Diego must love to hear that.)
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it's really the !ital!players!off! you root for, not
the front office.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, these aren't the players you rooted for in that
final season at Anaheim Stadium _ among the 1994 starters, only
cornerback Todd Lyght was still on the 1999 training-camp roster.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, that helmet is pretty cool.
</P>
<P>
   What's a lapsed Rams fan to do?
</P>
<P>
   Said Taylor, 33, a history and phys-ed teacher at Oak Grove High
in Ojai: ``I hate to see Georgia Frontiere make a dime. I hate John
Shaw. I feel like they ran the team into the ground. They made a
lot of bonehead moves and then turned around and blamed it on us.
It's too bad, because there are things to like. I love (head coach)
Dick Vermeil. I love Marshall Faulk.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Martinez, 37: ``My friends say, `They moved away, how can
you root for them?' I tell them the Rams are my whole childhood,
what can I do?'' Besides, Martinez thinks the St. Louis deal was
``too good to pass up.''
</P>
<P>
   It's funny. On my desk is a file bulging with letters from
Raiders fans pining for their team's return from Oakland. I've
never received a letter from a Rams fan. The two teams left town at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the difference is that Rams management was smart enough to
leave, while Raiders management might be dumb enough to come back.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the difference is that old Rams fans have a conscience,
while old Raiders fans fans have an attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Is it OK to root for the Rams?
</P>
<P>
   For me there's probably no going back after a couple of years
ago when, looking for a new pro football team, I bought a really
cool 49ers hat. &QL;

BRADLEY PRESSES GORE ON HEALTH CARE , AND GORE PUSHES BACK ON
EDUCATION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ Displaying a new persistence and aggressiveness,
former Sen. Bill Bradley tried to poke holes Friday night in Vice
President Al Gore's health care, education and gun control
proposals in their second televised encounter. Gore, by contrast,
was far more tame as he questioned his rival's own commitment to
education, health care and managing the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two months after their first debate, when he declined to
engage Gore, Bradley tried a strikingly different approach. While
he spoke calmly, Bradley again and again put forth the same refrain
as he contended that his health care plan would extend insurance to
all Americans while Gore's would not: ``Who will you leave out?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't leave out anyone,'' Gore replied at one point. But
Bradley would not stop asking the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one,'' the vice president said once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not true,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley homed in on health care, Gore scolded his opponent
as lacking a comprehensive education plan and for supporting a
school voucher program when he was in the Senate. This week, Gore
unveiled an education plan that would spend $115 billion over 10
years to increase teacher salaries and improve public education.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley defended his education proposals, saying: ``If your
staff had checked the proposals I've made, they would have found
that there's an education component of almost each one of the
proposals. The difference is, I view education as integrated into
the lives of people where they're living their lives, not as a
program that comes from Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   The opponents for the Democratic presidential nomination agreed
more than they disagreed through the 90-minute debate at Daniel
Webster College here. In fact, they agreed so much that the
moderator, Ted Koppel, noted at the close that their differences
did not seem significant. He asked them to contrast their
leadership styles.
</P>
<P>
   The political terrain has changed significantly since Gore and
Bradley's first debate. As Bradley moved up in the polls here in
the state that holds the first primary on Feb. 1, Gore has
repeatedly, and aggressively, attacked his programs. Bradley did
not begin fighting back until about two weeks ago. But his climb in
the polls has stopped and the two men are in a dead-heat in this
state, according to several surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's assertiveness Friday night seemed intended to respond
to criticism that he was giving Gore an easy ride. Yet his
criticism was understated and still less aggressive than that of
Gore, who repeatedly challenged Bradley on how he would protect
Medicare. More than once, he cut off Bradley in mid sentence. But
Gore was calmer than in the first debate, when some critics faulted
him as too combative.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists in both camps had predicted far more fireworks
Friday night because of an open format in which an audience of
local residents and Koppel could ask questions. There were no time
limits. Despite some barbed exchanges, the tone was fairly civil.
</P>
<P>
   The debate became particularly heated when the questions turned
to health care, the major point of contention between the two
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he would do to get his proposal to expand health care
coverage to more Americans through a Republican-controlled
Congress, Gore instead talked about how his plan could be paid for
without raising taxes or jeopardizing other entitlement programs,
like Medicare, the government health care program for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has frequently asserted that Bradley's more expensive
health care plan might require raising taxes and would leave none
of the federal surplus for other programs, including for Medicare.
The vice president then asked Bradley what he would do to bolster
Medicare as the number of senior citizens rises sharply over the
next two decades.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than answer Gore's question, Bradley threw a question
back. Bradley asserted that his health care plan would extend
health insurance to almost all Americans, while Gore's would not.
``Who will you leave out,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't leave out anyone,'' Gore said as the two men proceeded
to talk over each other.
</P>
<P>
   Then Gore focused on another part of Bradley's health care plan
that he has frequently criticized in recent weeks: his proposal to
replace Medicaid, the government health care program for the poor,
with subsidized private insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also used his remarks on health care to tout his role in
the Clinton administration's management of the strong economy,
saying that protecting Medicare and Social Security would keep the
nation strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our achievements of the last six and a half years has
been to have a strong economy,'' the vice president said. ``And
that has been to get the big questions right,'' including
protecting Medicare. ``Bill does not set aside a penny'' for
bolstering Medicare, Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley responded by saying he considered Medicare ``the most
important government program on health care that we now have'' but
said that it was not yet essential to set aside to bolster the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also used a question on terrorism to embrace a Republican
presidential candidate, Sen. John McCain of Arizona. On Thursday,
Bradley made a joint appearance in New Hampshire with McCain to
call for overhauling the campaign finance system. Polls show McCain
is very popular among independent voters in New Hampshire, a group
that Bradley is also trying to court.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what Gore would do to fight terrorism, he noted that he
had sponsored with McCain a bill to control nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The forum began with Koppel asking both about their wives and
what sort of first ladies they would be. Gore responded that his
wife, Tipper, would be active in the role and pointed out how she
had ``worked hard on the issue of health care'' and had a graduate
degree in psychology. He also said Mrs. Gore ``spends a lot of time
on the plight of the homeless.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about his wife, Ernestine, Bradley said, ``In this case
people will find Ernestine a unique human being; she would be the
first immigrant first lady, having been born in Germany.'' He
added: ``She's real; she's dynamic. She will chart her way.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first questions from the audience involved the issue
of drug use and the questions about whether Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, had
or had not used cocaine. Bradley openly acknowledged that he has
smoked marijuana in the past, and pointed out that Gore had made a
similar acknowledgment, but said, ``I think people have an
understanding of the nuances of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates also spoke forcefully about the responsibility
of the news media and the entertainment industry in policing the
amount of violence and sex that young people can see. Bradley
recalled the high school seminars he gave in New Jersey and
mentioned how he once asked the students if they had seen someone
killed. Bradley said that two youths said that they had and then he
offered a graphic description of someone being shot in the head.
Speaking of one student, Bradley said, ``Then he said, `You know
senator, it was nothing like it was on TV.'''

   The two Democrats met for their first televised encounter in
Hanover, N.H., on Oct. 27. That event was notable more for what the

A LAWYER'S LEGAL VICTORY GOES AGAINST AN OLD HAUNT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Twenty thousand dollars. That was the price of a poll
of Bronx jurors that defense lawyers for the four officers charged
with second-degree murder in the killing of Amadou Diallo thought
they needed to support their motion for a change of venue.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lot of money for a defense team already facing hefty
legal costs, and it was a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   But two of the lawyers representing Officer Sean Carroll _
Burton B. Roberts and Bennett M. Epstein _ argued strenuously that
the poll was worth it. Roberts said Friday that he even found
someone _ whom he would not name _ to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burt and I saw it as really preventing a lynching,'' Epstein
said of the motion, which he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was done, and so was the motion, and on Thursday, the
costly tactic paid off. The state Supreme Court's Appellate
Division ruled that the trial should be moved to Albany. The court
agreed _ partly on the basis of the poll _ that passions about the
case made the selection of an impartial jury in New York City
impossible. The poll said, among other things, that 81 percent of
potential Bronx jurors believed there was ``no justification
possible'' for the police officers' firing 41 shots at Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   For Roberts, a former chief administrative justice of the Bronx,
and for Epstein, his former law clerk, it was a career-capping
moment. ``We came riding back from the sunset,'' Epstein joked.
</P>
<P>
   But for Roberts, the glory was built, to an extent, on
repudiating the place and the jurors he presided over as
administrative justice.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly three decades, Roberts had prowled the Bronx courts _
he was district attorney before his appointment to the bench _ and
he had defended its jurors against accusations that they were out
of step with the rest of the city.
</P>
<P>
   But this legal victory rested in part on the notion that the
Bronx is ``a place in which large numbers of people harbor an
inherent distrust or even hatred of the police,'' in the words of
the motion.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx borough president, Fernando Ferrer, who roundly
condemned the appellate court's decision, called Roberts' position
``a complete absurdity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly I am loath to diminish former Judge Roberts,''
Ferrer added, ``but his previous statements spread on the public
record over a number of decades are at wide variance with his
present statements as defense counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Roberts denied there was any contradiction. ``I believe
strongly that if ever a case merited a change of venue, this case
certainly did,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned the case of Larry Davis, who was acquitted by a
Bronx jury of the attempted murder of nine police officers in 1988.
He called that a ``strange verdict.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts also said Bronx juries seemed to acquit more frequently
on gun and drug charges, which usually rely on police officers'
testimony, which suggests ``there is maybe a feeling against police
officers.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, that did not mean every police officer should be
entitled to a change of venue. The pretrial publicity in the Diallo
case was exceptional, he said. ``The whole city was infected with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, he said, ``you could question jurors _ you could
have peremptory challenges.'' But in this case, he said, the taint
was too great.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bronx,'' he added, ``should not be disenfranchised.''
</P>
<P>
   But the clamor that the appellate decision did just that
continued Friday. The Rev. Al Sharpton joined about 50 protesters
and the Diallo family in a protest outside the Bronx County
Courthouse, and the Diallo family also met with the Bronx district
attorney, Robert Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Reed, a spokesman for Johnson, said the district attorney
told the family that the court's decision appeared to be
unappealable, but that if a legal basis to appeal could be found,
the office would pursue it. Court officials still were unsure when
the trial would begin. It had been set to start Jan. 3 in the
Bronx. A judge in Albany must be selected and then given time to
become familiar with the case. Previous rulings in the case would
stand, but pending issues, like whether the prosecution should be
required to turn over reports of the expert witnesses it plans to
use, will be up to the new judge.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, who withdrew as the lead attorney in the case last
month, said: ``I really commend the Appellate Division for the
wisdom and courage they displayed. I can't praise them enough.''

   BEIJING _ When China's leaders in Beijing look south at Macau,
which returns to Chinese sovereignty Sunday night, they do not see
a tiny island rife with casinos and bedeviled by crime.
</P>
<P>
   They see glorious destiny. They see the end of foreign
oppression. And, most importantly, they see a cause for hope that
the mainland will eventually annex Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Once Macau returns, ``the great endeavor of reunifying China
will take a big step forward,'' President Jiang Zemin said last
week. ``Under these circumstances, the task of resolving the Taiwan
issue'' will ``appear increasingly urgent.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the Chinese are going all-out this week to mark the
hand-over of Macau to China, after more nearly 450 years of
colonial rule by Portugal.

   Although a new millennium arrives in less than two weeks, the
digital countdown clock that now graces Tiananmen Square marks the
seconds to Macau's return. This weekend, there will be a gala on
the square for 30,000 guests featuring fireworks and dragon dances.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, newspapers here are documenting in excruciating
detail the preparations of cities, old folks clubs and religious
groups. They have lovingly described the 600 potted lotuses donated
to Macau by the nearby Chinese city of Zhuhai, and the 12-foot-long
commemorative picture made using 14,000 pieces of fish bone by a
retiree in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese attach great importance to the return of Macau,
primarily for symbolic and political reasons,'' said Jia Qingguo,
an international relations professor at Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging Macau's chronic problem with crime, a
byproduct of the gambling that forms the base of its economy, he
said: ``To Chinese, these are practical issues that will be dealt
with between the Chinese government and the new special
administrative region of Macau. The far larger issue is that of
Chinese reunification and that has tremendous symbolic and
emotional value.''
</P>
<P>
   For centuries before the Communists took power in 1949, bits and
piece of China were taken over by Western nations and Japan, a
legacy that still rankles the Chinese. The return of tiny Macau is
viewed as proof of China's rejuvenated status in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that China is once again powerful,'' said a retired
railway conductor surnamed Liu who was out buying vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government clearly hopes that sentiments like these
will boost its popularity at a time of great economic uncertainty.
Still, it is linkage between the Macau hand-over and an eventual
reunification with Taiwan that has consumed China's leaders in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan, a Japanese colony from 1895 to 1945, became the seat of
the Chinese Nationalists after they lost the civil war to the
Communists in 1949 and is still considered a renegade province by
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   With the return of Macau assured, many leaders see Taiwan as the
missing piece of the China puzzle. And they hope that by applying
the ``One Country _Two Systems'' formula of relative autonomy to
Macau, as they have to Hong Kong since its return in 1997, they
will somehow convince Taiwan that reunification is workable.
</P>
<P>
   To help gin up popular enthusiasm, the government has declared a
holiday on Monday and state television will broadcast live from
Macau for the 48 hours surrounding the hand-over. But it is unclear
if the media blitz is having the desired effect.
</P>
<P>
   Many state companies have scheduled events, although in the
spirit of modern China, some are celebrating the return to the
Motherland and the arrival Father Christmas at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I'm happy because Macau is China's territory and
it's coming back,'' said Fu Xiaozhen, a fashionably dressed
26-year-old. ``My company is having a joint `return of Macau' and
Christmas party, since it's more convenient that way.''

ADULATION, STATE TITLES GO TOGETHER IN STEPHENVILLE
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STEPHENVILLE, Texas _ With the anxious energy of two fleas,
8-year-old Adrion Edwards and his friend, 8-year-old Chase Skiles,
argue about their favorite football players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanna be Cody Avalos,'' Edwards says. ``He's good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Brady Gunn,'' Skiles says. ``He hits really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Avalos and Gunn are two of the Stephenville High School football
players who walk amid this NFL-type adulation from children and
elderly citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In Stephenville, (pop. 15,450) a relaxed community located on
Texas 377 about 60 miles southwest of Fort Worth, Avalos and Gunn
are bigger than Deion Sanders or Major Applewhite.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid I always wanted to play for Stephenville;
it's a big deal,'' senior receiver Toby O'Neal said. ``It's cool to
get caught up in it here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here'' is a place that proves small-town America isn't
extinct. It's a place where everyone knows everyone, and children]
revere their Friday night football heroes as much as they do Santa
Claus.
</P>
<P>
   It's a town where the biggest buildings are the churches. A town
where the boys wear their hair short and the girls wear theirs big.
A town where teen-agers work in fast-food restaurants, cruise the
drag on weekends and super heroes are born on touchdowns, sacks and
game-winning kicks.
</P>
<P>
   Children and senior citizens alike will watch the Yellow Jackets
(15-0) play Port Neches-Groves (14-1) at 4 p.m. today at the
Astrodome in Houston for the Class 4A Division II state title.
Stephenville is going for its fourth title of the '90s and the
unofficial moniker ``Team of the Decade.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the town Odessa wanted to be in H.G. Bissinger's
best-selling book ``Friday Night Lights'', which chronicled] the
football fervor of Odessa Permian High School 10 years ago. Unlike
a town rife with economic and racial divisiveness, Stephenville
seems to be a true Texas football town.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband had a chance to take a job in Granbury, but we
turned it down,'' said Cindy Carrell, whose son, Chris, plays
football at Stephenville's middle school. ``One of the main reasons
we stayed here is because he wants to play football so badly for
the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years ago, Carrell's husband probably would have taken
the job. You see, Stephenville has not always been mentioned as a
quintessential football community.
</P>
<P>
   There is a definite line in Stephenville's football lore. B.B.,
Before Briles and A.B., After Briles.
</P>
<P>
   Before coach Art Briles arrived in 1988, Yellow Jackets football
tradition wasn't worth much more than a home security system in
Stephenville. Before Briles, the Yellow Jackets hadn't made the
playoffs since 1952. Since, Stephenville is 135-29-2 with three
state titles, all in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hiring Art was the luckiest thing I've seen,'' said ex-state
senator Bob Glasco, a Stephenville attorney and big Yellow Jackets'
backer. ``Those kids would walk through a wall if Art told them to.
It's really gotten the community together; I see people who haven't
spoken to one another in 13 years sitting next to each other
shaking cans.''
</P>
<P>
   The shaking cans _ Yellow Jackets fans use propane cans filled
with ball bearings to make thunderous noise at games. It's all part
of Stephenville's tradition, along with a booster club, fans
following the team by the thousands to away games and waiting in
the stands for two hours for kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   Booster-club membership has more than tripled and, Glasco said,
donations to the school's athletic department neared $200,000 last
season. The waiting list for season tickets for reserved seating is
a few years long.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want to be more than fans and participate in the
program, there is always a role, regardless of age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the games since I was a kid with my little
cheerleading outfit on,'' senior] dance-team member Tori Turley
said. ``You start learning the dances when you're 6]. I know it's
crazy, but I always wanted to be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the posturing Stephenville's citizens do, of all the
revenue and publicity for the town that is correlated with the
football team, there are moments when the hype exceeds any Texas
football stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to date this one football player whose idea of renting
a movie was to watch his game film,'' dance team member Ericka
Wheat said. ``And if you are out with a letter jacket on or people
know you are from Stephenville, the first thing you get asked about
is the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a few pockets of people who feel the hoopla
surrounding the team can be a bit much, most believe that the team
has been such a positive beacon that if _ heaven forbid _
Stephenville losses today, life goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're gonna win,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   If this is a true Texas football town, they probably will.

BUSH SAYS IF THERE WERE POCKETS OF HUNGER IN TEXAS, HE'D KNOW ABOUT
IT

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Gov. George W. Bush challenged on Friday a recent
federal report that said many Texans, including children, are going
to bed hungry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the report that children in Texas are going hungry.
Where?'' Bush said in an interview with the Star-Telegram. ``I want
to know the facts. I would like for the Department of Agriculture
to show us who. Where are they, and we'll respond.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No children are going to go hungry in this state,'' declared
Bush, whose ``leave no child behind'' slogan has become a theme of
his frontrunning presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll fix it and respond,'' he added. ``You'd think the
governor would have heard if there are pockets of hunger in
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Anti-hunger activists and food pantry workers were startled at
Bush's statements, saying emergency food distribution has risen
sharply in Texas as soup kitchens strain to meet demand.
</P>
<P>
   `I'm shocked he said that,'' said Sharon Hogan, executive
director of the Metroplex Food Bank in Fort Worth, which
distributes food to the needy and to food pantries. ``There are
massive amounts of people who go hungry. I could you give you story
after story.''
</P>
<P>
   On a bulletin board inside her office is a photo of a 7-year-old
boy who lost most of his teeth from malnutrition, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I'll get to work at 6:30 a.m. and find people in the
parking lot waiting for food that we don't distribute until 1
p.m.,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The federal study that Bush challenged, a U.S. Department of
Agriculture report entitled ``Measuring Food Security in the United
States,'' says about 13 percent of Texas households were ``food
insecure,'' or unable to meet basic food needs at all times,
between 1996 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   About 5 percent of Texas households suffered from hunger during
the period, a rate surpassed only by Oregon. The study defines
hunger as insufficient food intake causing an uneasy or painful
sensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a new report saying there's hungry kids in Texas.
It's been true for years,'' said Celia Hagert, nutrition policy
analyst at the Center for Public Policy Priorities, an advocacy
group for low-income Texans. ``It's ludicrous to say there's no
hungry people in Texas. It's just ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the report was carefully conducted using a detailed
questionnaire. Bush, however, suggested that Texans who need food
assistance are already receiving it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got food banks,'' the Republican governor said. ``We've
got food stamps. You know there's a lot of people that are poor
people, but I'd like to know who's going hungry in the state of
Texas. That report just kind of flew out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Janet Cocciarelli, director of the Texas Association of Second
Harvest Food Banks, a non-profit which distributes food to hunger
relief agencies, said a steady increase in demand for food aid
indicates there are hungry Texans, children and adults alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are definitely hungry children in Texas,'' she said.
Distribution projections for 1999 show the organization will
distribute 120 million pounds of food to 19 Texas food banks, a 26
percent increase over 1996, when welfare reforms took effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're finding within the food banking industry is we are
not able to keep up with the increased demands on our member
agencies,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Molly Beth Malcolm, the state Democratic party chair, accused
Bush of living in a ``land of illusions'' and repeated criticism of
his 1995 veto of a unanimously passed bill that would have created
a volunteer Food Security Council to study the hunger problem and
help acquire hunger grant money.
</P>
<P>
   In his veto proclamation, Bush said he rejected the bill because
it was ``not in the state's best interest to create another
bureaucratic entity ... when a private organization could be more
effective.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are children probably within a mile or two of his
Governor's Mansion that are hungry,'' Malcolm said. ``Every member
of the Legislature acknowledged that there were hungry people in
this state when they passed that hunger bill four years ago. Bush
refused to face reality then, and he's refusing to face reality
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush made his comments as he prepares for the GOP presidential
primaries, which begin next month. On Friday, surrounded by his
fellow Republican statewide elected officials, the governor filed
the paperwork to appear on the ballot in Texas on March 14.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, in a news conference and, later, in an interview with
the Star-Telegram, Bush:
</P>
<P>
   Said that Texas, facing potentially drastic measures to clean up
its dirty air, was right to pull the plug in 1995 on a politically
unpopular tailpipe testing program. The state later had to pay the
contractor, Tejas Testing Technology, $140 million for canceling
the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so sure of your premise that the air would have been
cleaner if we had centralized testing in the Metroplex or Harris
County,'' Bush told a reporter. ``I think that was an assumption
that just wasn't valid.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Vice President Al Gore, potentially his White House rival,
is proposing to usurp the states' traditional role in overseeing
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Al Gore wants to do is to run for federal superintendent
of schools,'' Bush said. ``The state's role is to build buildings
and the state's role is to pay teachers more. The federal role, to
the extent that it's focusing on children, needs to demand for
results and standards and high accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush criticized Gore's proposal to provide universal pre-school,
saying the government already has a sufficient pre-school program _
Head Start, essentially a pre-school program for poor children:
``We've got a pre-school _ called Head Start,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Said that European demands to require labeling of U.S. beef
produced with hormones, or of genetically altered foods, reflects a
desire to ``smear U.S. products.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I sense they want to run a propaganda campaign,'' he said.
``There needs to be scientific labels as to whether something is
safe or not. What I'm for is for there to be truth in advertising
that enables a product manufacturer to clearly state nothing in
this product is harmful to your health, for example.''

 &HT;    Student arrested at Georgia high school for threats, injuring
officer
 &HT;    By Gita M. Smith and S.A. Reid
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Teen-age emotions erupted Friday at Heritage High
School, ending with threats, pepper spray and an arrest.
</P>
<P>
   A 16-year old Heritage student was arrested at the school and
charged with battery, felony obstruction of a law enforcement
official, terroristic threats and interference with government
property.
</P>
<P>
   According to a police report, the arrest came after an angry
student said, ``I wish they had been killed in the shooting last
year and I may come up here and kill them myself.''
</P>
<P>
   She was referring to the May 20 incident when Anthony ``T.J.''
Solomon, who was a sophomore at the school, opened fire on
classmates, injuring six.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning's incident took place in a school office when the
girl, a junior, became upset and could not be calmed down, said
Rockdale County Sheriff's Department Lt. Mike Ransom.
</P>
<P>
   She hadn't wanted to be in a room with another student, and
emotions escalated.
</P>
<P>
   Ransom said the girl ``got out of control, injured a school
resource officer (Dave D'Loivo), with kicks and punches, damaged a
door and threatened bodily harm.''
</P>
<P>
   In the office she tore the hardware from a door and frame and
fought with school officials who called on the school resource
officer, said Sheriff's Department Corp. Jeff Baker.
</P>
<P>
   During the course of the incident, the girl was subdued with
pepper spray. She was treated at the scene and then transported to
Rockdale County Hospital before being taken to the Gwinnett County
Youth Detention Center. She later was released into the custody of
her parents.
</P>
<P>
   D'Loivo also was treated for his injuries at the hospital and
released.
</P>
<P>
   Rockdale County Schools spokeswoman Susan Paul Smith said she
did not know whether the student has been suspended from school or
whether charges had been brought against others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an ongoing investigation, and we do not have anything
else to say at this time,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The student's parents have retained a lawyer and have threatened
to sue school officials for using what they consider excessive
force.
</P>
<P>
   Her 24-year-old brother said she told him after her release that
there never was an altercation. The other student involved is
prepared to come forward to support her story, the brother said.
</P>
<P>
   He said his parents' lawyer advised them not to comment. He
described his sister as an average student who has sometimes gotten
in trouble at school for taking back to teachers but would never
make such a threat.

A HIGH-TECH HANUKKAH GIFT DRAWS UNEXPECTED GUESTS: DETECTIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Samuel Posner opened the Hanukkah gift from his
son, the high-tech gizmo seemed like any other pricey new toy.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. The gift, which resembled a videocassette recorder,
contained top-secret technology designed by Microsoft Corp.,
potentially worth $1 million, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Posner, 68, a lawyer, said he learned this when detectives from
the city's Computer Investigative Unit showed up at his Manhattan
apartment on Thursday night, in hot pursuit of industrial
espionage.
</P>
<P>
   The astonished lawyer had not yet unpacked the device.
</P>
<P>
   How the item _ a cutting-edge version of a WebTV box, a device
that can make an ordinary television set capable of browsing the
World Wide Web _ got from Microsoft's office in Mountain View,
Calif., to Posner's apartment was being investigated by New York
and California detectives.
</P>
<P>
   While they had yet to make arrests, the Mountain View police
said they thought a Microsoft employee might have changed the
shipping labels in the mailroom, either inadvertently or in an
effort to steal the device.
</P>
<P>
   Posner was not pleased. ``If Microsoft felt that something
improper had taken place, they should have contacted us and said,
`Hey, Posner, we sent you something by mistake,''' he said,
``instead of having two detectives in plain clothes show up banging
on the door as if we were criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Posner's son, Scott, 34, who works for the Bank of New York and
also lives in Manhattan, declined to comment. A Microsoft
spokeswoman, Angela Yearta, said the company was grateful to the
police for helping to retrieve the box but had no comment on the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Posner's woes began in Mountain View, where Microsoft's WebTV
operation is based. There, the device was engineered as a prototype
with new features that would not be on the market for at least a
year, said Detective Ted Cappozziello of the Computer Investigative
Unit of the New York City police.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the proprietary information and the new sophistication
of the equipment,'' he said, ``Microsoft valued it as being worth
$1 million.''
</P>
<P>
   The device was packaged and labeled for shipment to an engineer
at Microsoft's corporate headquarters in Redmond, Wash. But the
engineer became alarmed when he received only a partial shipment.
``He said, `I got the cord, but where is the box?''' Cappozziello
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft told the Mountain View police that the United Parcel
Service package had somehow been rerouted from Redmond to
Manhattan, to the home of Scott Posner.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, Scott was out walking his dog, and his wife,
who is seven months pregnant and confined to bed, was on the phone
with her father-in-law, when she heard men banging on her door who
said they were police officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said to her, `Don't open the door,''' recalled Samuel
Posner, who stayed on the phone while he and his daughter-in-law
tried to figure out what the detectives wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing seemed so suspect, especially when they
started talking about this million-dollar whatever,'' Samuel Posner
said. Once the detectives revealed the UPS tracking number that was
on the package, Posner agreed to turn over the box, and the
detectives went to his apartment 10 blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   According to the police, Scott Posner told them a friend at
Microsoft had sent him the WebTV box, which he received on Dec. 11,
and he had given it to his father as a Hanukkah present.
</P>
<P>
   As for Samuel Posner, he hopes, in this season of gift-giving,
that the next present will be less eventful, a merino wool scarf,
perhaps, or a Brooks Brothers tie.

BRADLEY, GORE SPAR OVER HEALTH CARE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ Democratic presidential contenders Al Gore and
Bill Bradley clashed over how to improve health care and education
during a debate Friday that also underscored their similarities on
school violence, foreign policy and gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   In their second televised debate Gore also made it clear he
disapproved of GOP presidential front-runner George W. Bush
invoking Jesus Christ in the last Republican debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in the separation of church and state,'' the vice
president said.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute town hall meeting broadcast on ABC-TV's
``Nightline`` did not reveal much new about the candidates, who are
locked in a close race in this first primary state. But the
free-wheeling format _ the only rule was to remain seated _ allowed
them to actually debate their differences.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bradley mounted a strong defense of his proposals, Gore
was more aggressive, telling the audience at Daniel Webster College
that his opponent ``is a good man with some bad plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has proposed gradually increasing health insurance for
more Americans, attacked Bradley for his ambitious plan, which the
vice president said would be so expensive that there would be no
money left to deal with looming financial problems of Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said his own plan would set aside 15 percent of the surplus
to deal with Medicare, while, ``Bill does not set aside one
penny.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said Bradley's plan to abolish Medicaid and instead
provide tax-supported vouchers to beneficiaries would not be
adequate to cover the poor and the disabled's medical needs.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley countered that his health plan would address the
problem of the uninsured better than Gore's incremental approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do provide access to affordable health care for all
Americans and his plan does not,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who will you leave out?'' the former senator asked Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't leave out anyone,'' Gore shot back. But the vice
president said that he didn't want to do anything that would stymie
economic growth. Although Gore said he would consider increasing
cigarette taxes to pay for health care, he said he would not raise
income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be talking about targeted tax cuts,'' he said.
Bradley has acknowledged that he might have to increase taxes to
pay for his plan.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley tried to rebut Gore's claim that he would not address
Medicare's problems by saying the health insurance program for the
elderly does not become insolvent until 2017 and that it was too
early to devise a solution.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley also sparred on the issue of education. The
vice president charged that his opponent had supported
private-school vouchers in the past and had not come up with a plan
to help the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he had laid out a comprehensive program to improve
education that included more money for preschool programs such as
Head Start. Although he acknowledged voting for vouchers in the
past, Bradley said ``I do not believe vouchers are the answers to
public education.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore took aim at Republicans when a member of the audience asked
about the GOP presidential candidates' religious discussion during
an Iowa debate Monday night. Asked what philosopher or thinker they
admired most, Bush and Gary Bauer cited Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that although he affirmed his faith, ``I always try to
do so in a way that communicates absolute respect not only for
people who worship in a different way but just as much respect for
those who do not believe in God.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atheists have just as much a right to public discourse as any
set of people in any religious faith,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was less critical. Every politician, he said, had to
decide for himself how to handle questions about his religious
faith. As for himself, Bradley said ``I have decided that personal
faith is private, and I will not discuss it with the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the evening the Democrats also agreed on many
items, including the need for more gun control and media
self-policing to stop the sort of juvenile violence that occurred
at Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   Both men also said they would stress diplomacy to head off a
conflict between Taiwan and China. While supporting the space
program, Bradley said he ``wouldn't commit to a date certain for
exploration of Mars.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore concurred. ``We have got to have a mission to planet Earth
to focus on our problems'' before what he called the inevitable
event of a human being landing on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Although both men affirmed their support for gay rights, they
did not endorse gay marriages
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't support gay marriages because I think it is matter of
religious sacrament as well as a legal state,'' said Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and Bradley endorsed ending the military's
``don't-ask, don't-tell policy'' and offering other legal
protections to gays, such as honoring domestic contracts between
partners.
</P>
<P>
   Although the debate was largely civil, Bradley had anticipated
his opponent would come out swinging. Earlier in the day, Bradley
warned he would respond in kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't take an elbow without returning an elbow, and that's
what's going to happen,'' said the former professional basketball
player.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who toured a Manchester company that sells candles over
the Internet, refrained from criticizing his opponent right before
the debate. But the vice president's campaign gleefully touted the
endorsement of Sen. Frank Lautenberg, R-N.J.,who hails from
Bradley's home state and served with both Bradley and Gore in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley continues to trail the vice president by a wide margin
in national polls, but he is slightly ahead of Gore in New
Hampshire, according to a Washington Post/ABC poll published
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The poll had Bradley leading Gore 48 percent to 45 percent, with
Bradley garnering more support among men, independents, liberals
and those with higher incomes and more education. He also received
support from voters who have become disillusioned with President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As Bradley toured a mall in southern New Hampshire earlier in
the day, a number of shoppers said they would vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just has a trustworthy face,'' said Sharon Lamoureux, 40,
of Pelham.

<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ Sen. Frank Lautenberg, a three-term Democrat from
New Jersey, announced Friday his endorsement of Vice President Al
Gore over his state's favorite son, former Sen. Bill Bradley, for
the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg, who served alongside Bradley in the Senate for 14
years, flew here Friday afternoon to make the announcement to
reporters prior to a debate between Gore and Bradley at a college
here.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey senator, who will retire from Congress at the end
of next year, said he had made up his mind to support Gore a year
ago, when Bradley had not declared his intention to run. But he
said Friday that even if he had known Bradley was going to run, he
would have endorsed the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experience of Al Gore was the deciding factor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign tried to play down the announcement, saying
that Lautenberg told people months ago that he was supporting Gore.
But the Gore campaign said it had not made a formal announcement of
the endorsement until Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   While the Gore camp touted the endorsement as an important coup
that would perhaps be embarrassing for Bradley, Lautenberg had many
kind words for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both are men of integrity, both are honest men,'' Lautenberg
said of the rivals. ``You couldn't get me to say anything bad about
Bill Bradley.'' He added that if Bradley wins the nomination, he
will support him in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg's comments about Bradley are in contrast to those of
some other New Jersey Democrats, including Rep. Robert Menendez of
Union City, who have criticized Bradley for being aloof and
unhelpful to local politicians while a senator.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg was also known to occasionally clash with Bradley,
and many New Jersey Democrats say he privately resented Bradley's
celebrity when he was doing much of the work of delivering federal
funds for the state.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, Lautenberg said Bradley had been helpful to him
during his early years in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   And he fondly recalled that Bradley had refused to appear at
Lautenberg's victory party in his first election, out of concern
that he would draw the limelight from Lautenberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You've worked too hard for this,''' Lautenberg said.
``I was struck by that.''

SLUGGISH ROBITAILLE WILL SIMPLIFY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Kings managed fine when winger Luc Robitaille
was out with a broken foot, so it only made sense the offense would
pick up when he returned, and the wins would follow.
</P>
<P>
   That was seven games ago. And in that span Robitaille, a
consistent 40-goal scorer most of his career, has done little
offensively. Since returning Dec. 3, he has one goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've been not playing the way I want to play, so I
told (coach) Andy (Murray) that I intend to start playing a more
simple game, put things at the net and see what happens,''
Robitaille said. ``Sometimes when things don't go well you try to
push a little bit. That's all I'll do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about it. The last two games we didn't get a
lot of chances, but the games before that, we got a lot of chances,
but they didn't go in. We've gotten a lot of opportunities, but it
didn't go in, and when that happens you just have to go back to
basics and do the little things and the rest will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray contemplated switching lines against the Chicago
Blackhawks tonight, going so far as to have playmaker Bryan
Smolinski skate with Robitaille and Glen Murray in practice.
There's little doubt with the way Smolinski's passed the puck this
season, Robitaille would get scoring chances. But Murray, who
rarely juggles lines, said he would probably keep things intact
against the Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to give Luc the opportunity to show his 40-goal
form,'' Murray said. ``I think he needs to be around the net more.
I think he's handled the puck too much, and I think he shouldn't be
a puck-handler. He should be a puck finisher, and I think he
realizes that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rest in Storr: They are calling it post-concussion syndrome, and
it will keep goalie Jamie Storr out of the lineup for a while.
Storr, blitzed in back-to-back games before being yanked on both
occasions, was placed on injured reserve. Marcel Cousineau was
added to the Kings roster again.
</P>
<P>
   While Storr suffers through the headaches and dizziness caused
from the hit in Montreal, Murray wonders whether he did the right
thing by playing Storr against New Jersey and the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really only after the New York game that we felt there
might be a problem, and then not until we got back (to Los Angeles)
did we know,'' said Murray, pointing out Storr was examined by
three doctors on the road trip. ``Jamie's a real competitor and
wants to be in there, so maybe he was overlooking the problems he
was having. I guess he really wanted to go out there and play well
for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at it after and say as a coach, `Did I play somebody
who wasn't healthy?' But you don't know. You ask the player. He's
the only one who could make that judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   From the point: Defenseman Garry Galley won't play tonight, the
remnants of a concussion he suffered at New Jersey. Galley was
slated to undergo an MRI and CAT scan Friday night. . . . Stephane
Fiset will start in goal for the Kings. . . . The Kings are hoping
injured center Jozef Stumpel will return for Wednesday's game in
San Jose.

recovery thus far but will probably have permanent brain damage,
her family said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barrett's parents, Sharon and Arlen, appeared briefly at
Bellevue Hospital to share the news of their daughter's discharge
Friday and to thank New Yorkers for their support during the
monthlong hospitalization. Mrs. Barrett said that while her
daughter's recovery had been excellent, she still suffered from her
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barrett was nearly killed when a man slammed the back of her
head with a 6.5 pound paving stone on Nov. 16. Her mother said that
Ms. Barrett had severe headaches, as well as problems with speech
and decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the types of things that are going to take a while
to get back to normal,'' Mrs. Barrett said, adding that her
daughter would undergo therapy near their home in Athens, a small
city in East Texas. Moreover, she said, doctors had cautioned the
family that in many cases patients with neurological injuries as
serious as Ms. Barrett's did not recover completely. ``There's
always something that never returns to normal,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Barretts were cheerful, saying the recovery to date
had been faster and more extensive than doctors had predicted. They
also said that the timing of the discharge was cause for joy, and
that they would be returning to a home with a ``lovely Christmas
tree and a lot of food in the freezer.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrett said, ``She couldn't be released at a better time than
Christmas time.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrett, who has been undergoing chemotherapy and recently had a
cancer operation, leaned on a cane as he spoke. He said he was
feeling well and thanked New Yorkers for the flowers, cards and
donations the family had received. ``We want to just tell everyone
that we are so grateful,'' he said. ``God bless everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The Barretts also said that their daughter, who lived in Queens
before the attack, planned to return to New York within a few
months, and that they had no misgivings about safety in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Paris Drake, 32, a panhandler and career petty criminal, has
been charged in the attack and is being held at Rikers Island.
After the attack, the city began a crackdown on the homeless that
was criticized by civil libertarians and others.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, when asked whether they had any opinions about how the
city had handled the attack, the Barretts withheld judgment. ``I
still prefer not to make comments on that,'' Mrs. Barrett said.
``You don't want a Texan involved in your politics here, or your
decisions for your citizens.''

GROUP BUYS HUNT HOUSE, WOMEN'S RIGHTS SHRINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By GLENN COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ending seven months of uncertainty over the fate of a historic
property that was central to the movement for women's rights in the
United States, a nonprofit organization acquired the Hunt House in
Waterloo, N.Y., at auction Friday, pledging to restore it and
donate it to the National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   In a spirited 40-minute telephone battle among five bidders, the
1829 house was sold for $231,000 _ $91,100 above last month's
asking price. The winner was the Trust for Public Land, a nonprofit
conservation organization.
</P>
<P>
   Historians say the three-story Federal-style house was the site
of a tea party in 1848 at which a group of women organized a
women's rights convention in nearby Seneca Falls. That convention
sparked the national mass movement that ultimately led to the 19th
Amendment, which gave women the right to vote.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-room house, which had not been made available for sale
for 55 years, had been avidly sought by private buyers as well as
by public-spirited groups. The house was pictured recently in a Ken
Burns public-television documentary, ``Not for Ourselves Alone,''
about the women's rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were right up against our maximum bid,'' said Erik
Kulleseid, the New York state director of the Trust for Public
Land, ``and my concern was that someone would outbid us.'' He said
that 50 percent of the bid money came from the nonprofit National
Trust for Historic Preservation, which will work with the Park
Service in the restoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a trophy house,'' said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the
New York Democrat, ``and I was fearful that someone might buy it
just to have it. The house deserves this happy news, the Park
Service deserves it, and New Yorkers deserve it.'' Last August the
senator introduced legislation, which is still pending, authorizing
the Park Service to purchase the Hunt House.
</P>
<P>
   Josie Fernandez, Park Service superintendent of the Women's
Rights National Historical Park in Seneca Falls, which will manage
the Hunt property, said: ``This is a wonderful gift for the nation.
As soon as someone hands us a key, we'd like to welcome America to
its house.''
</P>
<P>
   The 5.7-acre park, which includes the site of the Seneca Falls
convention, the Elizabeth Cady Stanton House and other landmarks,
was created in 1980 to celebrate women's history.
</P>
<P>
   The auction, which began at $205,000, was conducted by Greg Peet
of Patchen Real Estate in Waterloo, representing the retired owners
of the Hunt House and its 2.5-acre property, Thomas H. and Joan K.
Olmstead, who put the house on the market in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the house is in good hands with the Trust for Public
Land,'' Mrs. Olmstead said Friday after the auction.
</P>
<P>
   The auction was set last Friday when a purchase contract for the
Hunt House could not be fulfilled by Mary Church, a technical
writer and editor for an environmental consulting firm in
Rochester, who had wanted to buy the house with her husband,
Stephen. The purchase was contingent on the sale of the Churches'
own home in Bloomfield, N.Y., and they were unable to complete the
deal. The Olmsteads were then free to accept competing offers.

ON DOCTOR'S ORDERS, THE BALL WILL DESCEND 
</HEADLINE>

 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A New York City surgeon who has worked as a volunteer
in war-torn countries was chosen Friday to press the button that
will lower the ball in Times Square, ushering in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement ended speculation that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
might give the job of ``special guest'' to a 6-year-old boy who has
been the subject of a dispute between the United States and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon selected for the honorary job, Dr. Mary Ann Hopkins,
36, who works at Bellevue Hospital Center and New York University
Medical Center, has volunteered since 1996 with Doctors Without
Borders, an international medical relief organization that won the
1999 Nobel Peace Prize, spending extended periods in Sri Lanka and
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference with Giuliani, Dr. Hopkins said she hoped
her selection by the Times Square Business Improvement District and
NYC 2000, a mayoral planning group, would encourage others to
``engage in volunteerism and humanitarianism on a local and global
scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Past special guests have included Oseola McCarty, the
Mississippi laundress who donated her life savings of $150,000 to
the University of Southern Mississippi, and Sang Lan, a teen-age
gymnast from China who was paralyzed in the 1998 Goodwill Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the Dr. Hopkinses of the world who will help us pursue
peace and unity on our shaky, shrinking planet in the millennium
ahead,'' said Brendan Sexton, the business group's president, who
called her ``a true New York hero.''
</P>
<P>
   In picking Dr. Hopkins, Sexton's group and the mayor ended two
days of private discussions concerning Elian Gonzalez, the
6-year-old boy who was rescued at sea after his mother and
stepfather died, along with nine others, in an effort to reach
Florida from Cuba by boat. The boy's relatives in Florida and his
father in Cuba are seeking his custody, which has become an
international point of contention.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor had said on Thursday that the boy might be invited
from Florida to attend the celebration, and others said that the
mayor's aides had suggested selecting Elian as the special guest
who would push the all-important button.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, Giuliani said all the efforts to bring the boy to
New York had been dropped. ``The suggestion was worthy,'' he said,
``but probably not a good one for the welfare of the boy. Involving
him in this celebration would probably have created a lot of
confusion.''

FAMILY AWARDED $14.2 MIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By HEATHER ROMERO  
 and CHUCK HAWLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Maricopa County jury ordered General Motors to pay $14.2
million to the family of a Scottsdale woman who was run over when
her GM pickup truck lurched into reverse.
</P>
<P>
   The jury found the automobile giant negligent and said it should
have warned drivers of the potential transmission problem it
reportedly knew about since the late 1960s _ decades before Ruth
Golonka, 67, was killed.
</P>
<P>
   The award included $4.2 million in compensatory damages, with
$10 million in punitive damages. &UR; GM attorneys said they will appeal
the punitive award.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the southeast court complex in Mesa, Carol Chapman,
Golonka's daughter, spoke on behalf of the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that if we can have a heightened awareness (of the
safety problems) and we can save another life, all this will be
worth it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict mirrors several across the nation against GM.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Supreme Court this year reduced an $8.5 million
verdict awarded to the family of a man killed after his truck
slipped into reverse on a hill and crushed him. The high court
eliminated the $4.5 million punitive award and halved the $4
million compensatory damages, based on the driver's partial fault.
</P>
<P>
   A Montana man was awarded $1.3 million in 1990 after his truck
slipped into reverse. He is now a quadriplegic. A California jury
awarded $1.2 million to a man seriously injured in a similar
accident in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Golonka's family attorney, Adam Studnicki, said his team has
documented at least 400 incidents, including 30 deaths, where the
transmission slipped from ``hydraulic neutral'' to reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Golonka was killed April 17, 1997, when she stopped to pick up
some wooden chairs that someone had thrown out. Her half-ton GMC
Sierra truck suddenly slipped into reverse and crushed her under
its wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Golonka's widower, Eugene Golonka, and five children hugged
their attorneys after the verdict on compensatory damages was read.
They will split the award.
</P>
<P>
   The jury awarded a total of $7 million in actual damages, but
that was cut because the jury found Golonka to be 40 percent to
blame.
</P>
<P>
   Golonka's attorneys also asked the jury to find GM guilty of
faulty product design, but the jury did not agree.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for both sides agreed that GM vehicles with automatic
transmissions can shift into powered reverse from the ``no-man's
land'' between park and reverse.
</P>
<P>
   However, GM attorneys argued that the accident wouldn't have
occurred if Golonka had secured the truck by not leaving the engine
running and putting the transmission in park. The second phase of
the trial involved the jury's award of punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Daniel A. Barker of Maricopa Superior Court told jurors
they should consider all the arguments and evidence from the trial
in their new deliberations, as well as GM's net worth, $17.5
billion. Studnicki had suggested that an appropriate punitive award
might be $175 million, 1 percent of GM's worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you punish a company with no conscience, no heart, no
soul?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   James R. Condo, who represented GM throughout the trial, said
the compensatory damages award of $4.2 million already sent a
``very clear message'' to the automaker and asked, ``Is it right at
this point to do more?'' Condo said General Motors will appeal the
punitive award because ``there was no record in this case that
would support a punitive award.'' &QL;

WARNING ABOUT DANGERS OF BONFIRE CAME MONTHS BEFORE COLLAPSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (REMOVES ``other injuries'' from 2nd graf) 
 (th) 
 By ROSS E. MILLOY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Seven months before the Nov. 18 bonfire
accident that killed 12 people and injured 27 others at Texas A&AMP;M
University, a university vice president warned in a memorandum that
``we are dangerously close to having a serious incident that
connects alcohol, residence halls and bonfire,'' according to
documents released here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   J. Malon Southerland, the vice president for student affairs,
had issued the warning to colleagues on March 9 in response to a
series of problems reported to his office involving the bonfire, a
90-year-old tradition here, including alcohol abuse and hazing.
</P>
<P>
   The revelation was just one of many contained in nearly 3,000
documents, e-mail memorandums and photographs related to the
accident that were released this week by Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred as about 75 students were building a
bonfire as a part of the festivities surrounding the annual
football game against the university's archrival, the University of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The documents are expected to be part of the investigation
initiated by Texas A&AMP;M's president, Dr. Ray Bowen.
</P>
<P>
   Among the material was a police report about the 1998 bonfire
indicating that university officers discovered 30 students,
including 20 students who were underage, with a 15-gallon keg of
beer on the bonfire site. One of the underage students was found
unconscious and vomiting and had to be taken to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the students killed on Nov. 18 were legally drunk,
according to autopsy reports, and another student's blood showed
traces of alcohol. Evidence taken from the scene included empty
beer bottles and cans, bottlecaps, and at least one can of beer.
</P>
<P>
   But a new laboratory test has raised some doubt about claims
that two students were drunk, said a justice of the peace, George
Boyett.
</P>
<P>
   Boyett said that samples of fluids from the two victims had been
sent back for retesting and that those tests had different results.
He said an inquiry was under way.
</P>
<P>
   Southerland was not available for comment Friday after officials
issued a statement saying ``the university is taking the position
that its personnel will refrain from commenting on any aspect of
the inquiry or on any of the multitude of documents it has placed
on file for public review.''
</P>
<P>
   Leo E. Linbeck Jr., a Houston executive who is serving as
chairman of a five-person panel investigating the accident for the
university, said Friday that he did not believe that student
drinking or horseplay caused the log pile to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any sense that alcohol played a part in the
accident,'' Linbeck said, ``and we've had no evidence yet to
suggest that it did.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the investigation would examine questions raised about
the structural design, and any behavior by students or others that
might have contributed to the collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a massive job ahead of us, but if student drinking
was part of the problem, we'll indicate that in our report,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Linbeck, 65, a graduate of the University of Notre Dame,
compared the task of his commission to that of investigating the
crash of an airliner.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least with an air crash you know what the airplane looked
like and what it was supposed to do,'' Linbeck said. ``In this
case, we have to figure out what the design ambitions of the
bonfire were and whether or not it was built and performed to those
specifications.''
</P>
<P>
   Though university officials have a goal of March 31 for delivery
of the commission's report, Linbeck refused to be held to any
timetable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of aspects to this case, and we're going to
take all the time we need to come up with the answers,'' he said.
``We've already identified more than 70 key questions that need to
be answered, and we will answer them all before we're finished.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Dallas Morning News reported that the bonfire
was 4 feet higher than a 55-foot height limitation imposed in 1968
when a bonfire also collapsed, and that the final structure would
have risen higher than 70 feet when completed.
</P>
<P>
   Other reports have pointed out various violations of the
university's ``Bonfire Safety Handbook,'' including underclassmen
working in the upper reaches of the stack reserved for more
experienced participants.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An evaluation of the 1998 bonfire also contained in the
documents indicated that university officials had raised questions
about the safety procedures surrounding the bonfires. The
evaluation listed 34 injuries involving ax cuts, machete cuts,
abrasions, broken bones and multiple lacerations that required
hospital treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ben Welch, director of student activities at Texas A&AMP;M, was
the university official who received the police report on the 1998
bonfire. At the time of last month's accident, Welch was in the
midst of resolving hazing accusations surrounding this year's
bonfire activities.
</P>
<P>
   Two residence halls on campus, Crocker House and Walton House,
had been prohibited from participating in building the bonfire
because of complaints that their members had been involved in the
hazing of underclassmen.
</P>
<P>
   At least one bonfire ``yellowpot'' (a term for crew leaders on
the stack) was removed from his position on Nov. 10 and was
appealing his suspension at the time of the accident, according to
the documents.
</P>
<P>
   The documents gave no details about the type of hazing involved.
</P>
<P>
   Southerland's memo warning of potential problems involving the
bonfire and student drinking apparently prompted a meeting of
senior university staff on April 29.
</P>
<P>
   The official who called the meeting, Ron Sasser, director of
residence life for the university, summarized the discussions by
writing to his colleagues that ``these problems did not occur
overnight and will take time to significantly improve. Many
questions arose about whether they could ever be totally
resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote: ``It should be recognized that alcohol, bonfire,
traditions, hazing issues are very interwoven, in many cases are
difficult to seperate (sic). This again emphasizes the need for a
universitywide effort if the problems are to be resolved.''

MIRACLE CALL ANSWERED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By HEATHER ROMERO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a thief drove off and then ditched a sport-utility vehicle
with Clarissa Quihuis still inside, destiny called.
</P>
<P>
   And the 5-year-old answered.
</P>
<P>
   Clarissa picked up her mother's cell phone when it rang and
calmly gave detectives details about where she was _ right down to
the street numbers on nearby houses. She also followed the advice
to keep honking the horn, which helped bring Friday's harrowing
ride from Tempe to Phoenix to a quick, happy end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would pass on to parents to educate their kids to be aware
of their surroundings and learn about a cell phone. That's probably
what saved her,'' father Roy Quihuis said as he held Clarissa,
still dressed in her pink-and-white pajamas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud about that. She's my little girl.''
</P>
<P>
   The ordeal began about 6:30 a.m. when Lucia Quihuis left her
Suzuki Sidekick running, with Clarissa sleeping in the back, while
she ran inside a baby-sitter's Tempe home to take in the girl's
school clothes.
</P>
<P>
   When Quihuis returned to retrieve the child, both the vehicle
and the girl were gone.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe that the suspect, who is still at large and
identified as 20-year-old Jesse Bernal, didn't realize a child was
in the back seat until he drove off. He ended up ditching the car
and the girl just five miles away, but police had no idea at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   A frantic search was already under way when the mother
remembered she had a cell phone in the car. On a hunch, detectives
dialed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luckily the phone was on and she was able to answer it,''
Tempe police Sgt. Mike Scannell said.
</P>
<P>
   They found a scared little girl who had enough composure to
answer simple questions like, ``What do you see?''
</P>
<P>
   Helicopters and patrol cars quickly began scouring the nearby
area for landmarks Clarissa described.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Clarissa honked the horn, attracting the
attention of a group of middle school students at a nearby bus
stop.
</P>
<P>
   David Meza, 13, at first thought Clarissa was just playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then we noticed she was crying, with a runny nose and
tears everywhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meza, who had learned of the search for Clarissa from watching
the morning news, took the cell phone from her and called 911.
Another student wrapped her in his jacket until police arrived,
just an hour after the girl was reported missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still can't get her face, the way she looked when we found
her, out of my mind,'' Meza said.
</P>
<P>
   Clarissa had little to say when reporters questioned her later.
But police say she helped save herself from a situation that could
have been prevented.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope parents out here take this and learn from it,''
Scannell said. ``Take care, because in a matter of seconds, a lot
can happen.'' &QL;
