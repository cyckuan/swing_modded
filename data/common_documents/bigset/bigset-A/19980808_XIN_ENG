<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Rate Holds Steady at 4.5 pct in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. unemployment rate
remained steady at 4.5 percent in July, despite of the impact of
the General Motor strikes, which caused the worst factory job
losses in 16 years, the Labor Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The latest report matched June's seasonally adjusted rate and
was only slightly higher than the 28-year low of 4.3 percent,
recorded in May, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
In July, U.S. employers reported a net gain in jobs of only
66,000, the weakest month in two and a half years. Job growth was
held back by a drop of 176,000 in manufacturing, the largest since
October 1982.
</P>
<P>
The department attributed 146,600 of the loss to the direct or
indirect impact of the GM strikes, which began June 5, and were
settled last week.
</P>
<P>
Auto manufacturing alone suffered a drop of 111,000 jobs but
other industries that supply GM, the nation's largest corporation,
were forced to lay off their workers. The electronic components
and food industries as well as textile mills also lost jobs.
</P>
<P>
However, the aircraft industry and printing and publishing
added jobs. So did construction firms, up 18,000.
</P>
<P>
Government payrolls decreased by 12,000 positions, but many
service industries still are expanding robustly. Retail employment
increased by 125,000, including 69,000 jobs at restaurants and
bars.
</P>
<P>
Employment dipped at nursing homes and in home health care but
engineering and management services and computer services both
continued a long-term trend of strong growth. There were 32,000
new jobs in finance, insurance and real estate.
</P>
<P>
However, the better-than-expected situation in labor market
could revive concern that scarce labor will pressure wages higher,
crimping corporate profits and contributing to increased
inflation.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Friday condemned two terrorist attacks that killed dozens of
people at the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and vowed to
do everything in his power to find the people behind the bombings.
</P>
<P>
"These acts of terrorist violence are abhorrent, they are
inhumane," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"We will use all the means at our disposal to bring those
responsible to justice nor matter what or how long it takes,"
the president added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was awaken by a phone call at 5:30 from National
Security Adviser Sandy Berger who informed him of the bombings
at the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and in Dar-es-Salaam,
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman P.J. Crowley told reporters that
Clinton, when informed of the tragedy, was "deeply troubled."
</P>
<P>
"We're treating this as a terrorist attack," Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
He said there had been no claim of responsibility for the
explosions and would not comment on who the United States
suspected was behind the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Crowley said U.S. military aircraft would fly to the scene to
bring medical supplies and blood and be able to evacuate the
wounded.
</P>
<P>
He said stepped-up security measures were being taken at U.S.
embassies throughout the region.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Retailers Post Strong Sales for July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Most major U.S. retailers posted
strong sales in July, beating many pessimistic estimates and
showing that the consumer still strongly underpins the economy.
</P>
<P>
Results were strong across nearly all retail categories, from
discounters and department stores to speciality apparel and
electronics stores, according to statistics published by the Wall
Street Journal today.
</P>
<P>
Sales at stores open at least one year rose 5.7 percent in July,
up from 5.5 percent in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Many retailers said that their results were above expectations,
and that although July was traditionally a clearance month, they
sold more goods at full price.
</P>
<P>
The good performance was attributed partly to solid sales in
May and June, which helped clear out inventories, leaving
retailers more room to bring in new season and back-to-school
merchandise, which sold at regular price.
</P>
<P>
All of this is a good sign for retail earnings for the fiscal
second quarter which for most retailers ended in July.
</P>
<P>
The first quarter also saw positive earnings for many U.S.
retailers.

<HEADLINE> IBM Ending Olympic Deal Over Cost Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 7 (Xinhua)-- International Business Machines
Corp. is ending its worldwide sponsorship of the Olympic Games,
severing a 38-year marketing relationship in a wrangle over the
high cost of linking corporate marketing to sports, the Wall
Street Journal reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The pull-out came after several months of futile negotiations
with the International Olympic Committee, IBM said.
</P>
<P>
IBM wanted local organizing committees to start bearing some of
the technology costs. The two sides, however, could not agree on
how much money the local Olympic organizers should pay IBM and how
much IBM should have to give in exchange for marketing rights to
the Olympic rings, IBM said.
</P>
<P>
So the company is chose to walk away rather than lock up an
eight-year deal with the International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
The world computer giant spent more than 100 million U.S.
dollars to sponsor the 1998 Winter Games and provided much of the
technology behind it free of charge.
</P>
<P>
The bailout by IBM means that its sponsorship of the next
Olympics, the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, Australia, may be the
company's last.
</P>
<P>
IBM said that it was "fully committed to making the millennium
games an outstanding event" and "will market it heavily".

<HEADLINE> Germany Starts Minting Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MUNICH, August 7 (Xinhua) -- German Finance Minister Theo
Waigel Friday launched the minting of German-version euro coins at
the Bavarian General Mint in southern German city of Munich.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Waigel stressed again the significance of the
use of the euro in Europe, saying that the use of the single
European currency would remove the currency borders among European
Union (EU) countries, facilitating trade within Europe.
</P>
<P>
The European Monetary Union (EMU) was a great leap forward in
Europe's economic and political development, he added.
</P>
<P>
The euro is planned to be launched on January 1, 1999, in
European Union (EU) countries that join the EMU, which includes
Germany.
</P>
<P>
It is agreed that the euro will enter into circulation from
January 1, 2002, and must completely replace national currencies
of the EMU member countries by the end of June 30, 2002.
</P>
<P>
Bonn is considering shortening the euro transit period in
Germany in order to reduce the costs of switching over to another
currency from the German mark.
</P>
<P>
There are one-cent, two-cent, five-cent, 10-cent, 20-cent,
50-cent, one-euro and two-euro euro coins. Each category has a
unified front, and backs with different patterns bearing national
characteristics for easy acceptance by peoples. For Germany, the
back patterns are the German federal eagle, Brandenburg gate and
oak leaves.
</P>
<P>
Besides the Bavarian General Mint, the mints in Berlin,
Hamburg, Karlsruhe and Stuttgart are also authorized in Germany to
mint the euro.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 12.1 billion euro coins weighing 50,000 tons will
be needed in Germany alone when the euro completely enters into
circulation in EMU countries in 2002.
</P>
<P>
The specially-designed euro coins are highly
anti-counterfeiting, and can be easily distinguished by the blind
people.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's 1st EPZ Abandoned by Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's first export processing
zone (EPZ), gulping a huge investment of 600 million U.S.
Dollars, has proved to be a failure, as political instability has
scared off investors.
</P>
<P>
The EPZ in Calabar, Cross Rivers State, in southeast Nigeria,
was established through Decree 63 of 1992. It was expected that
the EPZ would attract more investors to Nigeria and boost its
non-oil exports.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, the law establishing the EPZ provides a wide
range of incentives for export-oriented investment in the zone,
including tax incentives and leasing of factories by instalments
in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the construction of infrastructure
facilities in the EPZ, including water and power supply,
telecommunications, roads and standard factory plants has cost
the Nigerian government 50 billion Naira (about 600 million
Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The dredging of the Calabar port alone, undertaken by a
Chinese firm, cost 50 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, the authorities have approved 19 firms to operate
in EPZ, including two textile and garments manufacturers with
foreign investment and a local wood products firm had reportedly
started test running by 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, now that the facilities are 95 percent completed,
none of the 19 approved firms have actually started business,
even the said three firms have abandoned their projects.
</P>
<P>
A recent visit to the EPZ by some reporters proved that it has
been actually deserted. The facilities are getting submerged in
overgrown bushes, while some buildings even have their zinc roof
blown off in rain storms.
</P>
<P>
This explains why the formal commissioning of the EPZ has been
delayed again and again.
</P>
<P>
An official of the EPZ authority said: "we don't want to
commission the EPZ when there are no activities here. Sincerely
speaking, the problem has to do with patronage."
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted that political instability and poor
infrastructure are the major obstacles preventing more foreign
investors from coming to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
A Nigerian newspaper recently quoted a western country's high
commission as warning its businesses to be cautious in investing
in Nigeria, saying it is better for them to be satisfied with
trade at the moment.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- A Danish delegation visiting Tibet
participated in a Friday symposium with local economists.
</P>
<P>
Gou Ling, an economist with the Tibet Planning Committee,
briefed the delegation on social and economic development in Tibet
since peacefully liberation some 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Tibet's 1997 gross domestic product hit 7.6 billion yuan, with
the average annual income of farmers surpassing 1,008 yuan, and
the level for residents in cities and towns topping 5,030 yuan.
The region's total population stands at slightly over 2.42
million, compared to only one million in late 1950s. Tibetans
currently account for 95 percent of the total population.
</P>
<P>
Tibet has initially formed an industrial system based on
textiles, hydropower and leather processing. The region's 4,000
primary schools, secondary schools and universities have a total
enrollment of 320,000 students.
</P>
<P>
The economist pointed out that Tibet's target is to basically
realize modernization by the middle of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He added that Tibet has scored major achievements with
extensive support provided by the central government which has
invested some 12 billion yuan in infrastructure construction over
the past 40 years. Scores of key construction projects in Tibet
have resulted in significant changes and brought great benefits to
local residents.
</P>
<P>
The Danish delegation also inquired about issues such as
environmental protection, the self-autonomy of ethnic minorities,
education in the Tibetan language and family planning.
</P>
<P>
The Danish parliamentary delegation, headed by Foreign Affairs
Committee Chairperson Helle Degn, also visited the Potala Palace
and Johkang Temple today.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Devaluates Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam on Friday effectively
devalued its currency, the dong, by about seven percent, bowing to
pressure resulting from the financial crisis that has ravaged
Southeast Asia since July last year.
</P>
<P>
On Friday morning, the State Bank of Vietnam lowered the
official rate of the dong to the dollar by 10 percent from 11,816
on Thursday to 12,998, while simultaneously narrowing the trading
band on either side of this rate from 10 to seven percent.
</P>
<P>
Because the dong traded at the ceiling of this trading band
before and after the devaluation, the effective devaluation
equalled seven percent.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Friday, the bank described the
devaluation as a necessary move aimed at forming a rational
exchange rate between the dong and the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The state bank's macro-control over the exchange rate would
encourage exports, limit imports and contribute to the increase of
the country's foreign exchange reserves, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The state bank has demanded all financial organizations
engaging foreign exchanges to set their rates in accordance with
the official one.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Says Not to Yield on Missile Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides said Friday that Cyprus would not yield to foreign
pressures over its planned deployment of Russian-made S-300
anti-aircraft missiles.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark during a meeting with a delegation of
refugees who had fled from areas in northern Cyprus, now under the
control of Turkish Cypriots, Cyprus News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said foreign officials have made suggestions on the
missile issue, and the Cypriot government has replied accordingly.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus signed a 425-million-U.S.-dollar deal with Russia early
last year to buy the sophisticated surface-to-air missiles, which
are due to be delivered and deployed late this year.
</P>
<P>
This is seen as a threat by Turkish Cypriots in the north and
Turkey, which has threatened a pre-emptive strike if they are
deployed.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign governments, especially the U.S. and Britain, have
voiced opposition to Cyprus' plan.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed
troops and took over the northern third of the Mediterranean
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greek Foreign Under-Secretary Yiannos Kranidiotis on
Friday briefed Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides on his
meeting in Athens early this week with United States Ambassador to
Greece Nicholas Burns on the missile issue.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides told reporters that the Greek diplomat's talks with
Burns were identical with those held recently between Cypriot
officials and U.S. Special Coordinator for Cyprus Thomas Miller.
</P>
<P>
But he declined to go into details of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Burns has reportedly proposed that Cyprus opt for the shorter
range S-15 missile system, instead of the S-300 system.
</P>
<P>
He also proposed a moratorium of Greek and Turkish military
overlight in Cyprus, which will be monitored by the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has made it clear that it is ready to cancel the missile
deal if peace talks between the two communities on the island make
substantial progress, or the proposed demilitarization of the
island is agreed on.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has maintained more than 35,000 troops in northern
Cyprus, with the claimed aim to protect the Turkish Cypriot
minority.
</P>
<P>
The peace process toward a solution to the long-running Cyprus
issue broke down last summer after the Turkish Cypriots withdrawed
to protest against a European Union (EU) decision to start
accession talks with the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots, who declared in 1983 a breakaway republic
in the north recognized only by Turkey, refused to join the
Cypriot government team in negotiations with the EU.
</P>
<P>
The international community has made efforts to help reunify
the island under the United Nations-sponsored bi-zonal and
bi-communal formula. But no tangible progress was achieved.

<HEADLINE> Yangtze River Water Levels Continues to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Flood situation has been worsening
further in central China's Hubei Province on Friday night as water
levels of Yangtze River are expected to go further in the coming
hours, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
At 24:00 pm, water level at the Shashi Measuring Point,
upstream of Wuhan, the provincial capital, buoyed up to 44.92 m,
compared with 44.88 m at just two hours before.
</P>
<P>
The water level at Shashi has further approached the level for
a proposed diversion plan to discharge flood waters into the
Jingjiang diversion zone, in Gong'an County, about 200 kilometers
west of Wuhan.
</P>
<P>
Some 250,000 local residents in the zone have been evacuated to
make way for the diversion so far. A total of 330,000 people are
expected to be resettled from the diversion area.
</P>
<P>
In related developments, the year's fourth flood crest passed
Yichang, upstream of Shashi, and is expected to reach Shashi
between 8:00-10:00 am on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The water level at Shashi is doomed to top 45 m, an expert from
the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Committee said.
</P>
<P>
However, the expert declined to discuss whether there will be a
diversion in the Jingjiang diversion zone, only noting that there
are two preconditions for the materialization of the diversion
program. A water level of 45 m and above, and it is going up
further in a foreseeable period.

<HEADLINE> Efforts Continued to Plug Up Breach in Jiujiang Dykes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Seven boats have by far been
dumped into a 40-meter breach of the city defence embankments in
Jiujiang City, east China's Jiangxi Province, with more following.
</P>
<P>
Bags of rice, soybean, and stones were also used for the
effort. As a result, most of the raging floodwaters have been
blocked, however, there are still some sneaking out into the city
through gaps between the sunken boats.
</P>
<P>
Now, thousands of soldiers and civilians are working to plug up
the breach, using more boats and other materials. And another
1,700 armed police are rushing to reinforce the effort, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
At about 12:30 Friday, a water-sodden point was found at the
city defence dykes, and dozens of minutes later grew into a leak
of two feet, and at 4 pm, the city defense embankments partially
collapsed, and water two meters deep began to inundate western
parts of the city through a 40-meter breach.
</P>
<P>
A coal boat on the river was ordered to come, and sunken to
block it, with another two boats joining in. The three sunken
boats have considerably slowed floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
Locally stationed soldiers are busy building a second
barrier. Eight boatloads of stone and 2,000 tons of rice are being
dumped into the breach.
</P>
<P>
The local Flood Control Headquarters has urged residents to
evacuate the area. People were transporting valuables to high
land, and all shops have closed.
</P>
<P>
The provincial Party secretary and governor have hurried to the
scene to guide the rescue work, and efforts are being made to
build another two barriers to protect the rest of the city.
</P>
<P>
Jiujiang City, along the southern bank of the middle reaches of
the Yangtze River, lies in the northern parts of east China's
Jiangxi Province, and the city proper covers an area of 42 square
kilometers, with a population of 500,000.
</P>
<P>
It has a lot of lakes and rivers, and the most well-known is
the Poyang Lake, the country's largest freshwater lake. For weeks,
the 3,976-square-kilometer lake has maintained record flooding
water levels.

<HEADLINE> WB Warns of Slowdown in Foreign Investment in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has warned that
foreign investments in India could slowdown further in the current
fiscal year unless the government undertook deeper and faster
deregulation of external and internal markets to encourage
efficiency and boost higher private investments.
</P>
<P>
India's economic environment is weakening in response to the
external and internal developments and thus intensifying the need
for further economic reforms, according to the Report on India
1998 Macro Economic Update released by the World Bank (WB) here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The WB report said that the first quarter of fiscal year
1998-99 (April to June) pointed to a general deterioration in the
economy with exchange rate falling by about 7.5 percent and a
reserve loss of over 1.6 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, 1997-98 witnessed a period of strong, private
sector led growth though there was a slowdown in some industrial
sectors particularly in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Gross domestic growth rate was five percent, inflation was
down, external position comfortable and contagion from the East
Asian currency crisis was minimal.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the Indian government's concern is now on
returning to sustainable growth rate of seven to eight percent
within a stable macro economy which can reduce poverty rapidly.
</P>
<P>
In its Union Budget approved by the Indian Parliament last
month, the government propose a pickup in privatization including
the willingness to cut government equity to 26 percent in most
cases, deregulation measures for insurance, urban land,
agricultural exports and foreign exchange, and cuts in red tape
for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Foreign institutional investors withdrew more then 400 million
U.S. dollars from the stock markets in India in May and 1.2
billion U.S. dollars in the first week of June, thus reducing
total reserves including gold to about 27.6 billion U.S. dollars
on June 12.

<HEADLINE> NATO, Polish Chiefs Share Concern Over Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The NATO secretary-general and
Polish president expressed a shared concern over the escalating
fighting in Kosovo, a NATO press release said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The press release said that NATO chief Javier Solana and Polish
DPA390HAB306I07TEQL01:2901:302013
President Aleksander Kwasniewski agreed during a meeting that the
development of the situation in the Yugoslav province carries a
danger of upsetting the political stability of the region and of
Europe as well.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the escalation of combat operations and the
suffering they inflict upon the civilian population coerce all the
political forces in Europe into taking steps conducive to the
inauguration of a dialogue between the Serbs and Kosovar Albanians
to end the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The NATO secretary-general and Polish president noted with
regret, the press release said, that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic had failed to deliver on his promise made to the
European Union that the armed operations of the Serb forces would
be discontinued.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski briefed Solana about the efforts being made by
Poland, currently the chairman-in-office of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), in pursuit of a
resolution of the conflict in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Solana informed the Polish president about NATO's preparations
DPA391SPE047S07PEQL01:3001:300505
for a reaction should the conflict spill over.
</P>
<P>
Both Kwasniewski and Solana declared themselves satisfied with
the progress of the enlargement progress.
</P>
<P>
The western military alliance has invited Poland, Hungary and
the Czech Republic to join it and the accession process has
entered the parliamentary ratification stage in all the 16 NATO
member states.
</P>
<P>
Up till now, legislators in 12 NATO member states have ratified
the accession and the three eastern European countries are
expected to join NATO in April next year when the alliance

NAIROBI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Eight Americans were killed and
another 15 wounded with one missing in the huge bomb blast at the
U.S. embassy in central Nairobi Friday morning, U.S. embassy
DPA399NAB132I07TEQL01:3101:311935
spokesman Chris Scharf told Xinhua by phone in the evening.
</P>
<P>
The dead include one child and two women, said Scharf.
</P>
<P>
"The rescue is ongoing. We are doing everything possible to
help those wounded and... to make sure everyone moved out of the
ruins," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added neither the U.S. embassy to Kenya nor the Kenya
police so far has any clues to the motivation behind the
explosion.
</P>
<P>
The whole death toll of the blast has increased to nearly 100
and more than 1,000 wounded have been rushed to hospitals, local
media said.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Television Network reported that both U.S.
Ambassador to Kenya Prudence Bushnell and Kenyan Trade Minister
Joseph Kamotho have sustained slight injuries.
</P>
<P>
Eye-witnesses at the scene told Xinhua that about 50 people
were killed on the spot.
</P>
<P>
All the main hospitals in Nairobi now are full of the victims,
said eye-witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi Friday evening inspected the
blast scene and visited some of the injured.
</P>
<P>
He said he was deeply shocked and condemned the attack.
</P>
<P>
The authorities would try best "to bring the perpetrators of
the heinous crime to book," he said, calling on people in the
capital city to help with medical facilities.
</P>
<P>
It was widely suspected that terrorists were behind the
explosions which obviously target U.S. embassies in the two
African countries, namely Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The bomb blasts in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam are said to be
the first ever of its kind since the two east African countries
gained independence in early 1960s.

President's Office said.
</P>
<P>
The rebellion in DRC is expected to be high on the agenda.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Justice Minister Pledges Fight Against Child Porn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The new Dutch minister of
justice pledged on Friday to intensify the fight against child
pornography in the country.
</P>
<P>
Benk Korthals made tackling child pornography a policy priority
and urged the set-up of a European Union-wide network of national
child porn database that will facilitate information exchange
between national investigative agencies.
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed to the Dutch parliament, the justice
minister, who was sworn in this Monday alongside Prime Minister
Wim Kok, said that faster procedures are needed for international
judicial investigation on the Internet in addition to existing
legal assistance treaties.
</P>
<P>
This is expected, he added, to lead to more effective action
against child pornography on the computer network.
</P>
<P>
The justice minister said that the number of convictions in
child pornography cases in the Netherlands has risen from three in
1994, prior to the introduction of heavier sentences, to 27 in the
last 18 months.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch authorities have time and again expressed their
determination to clamp down on child pornography and the Dutch
police are conducting investigation in close cooperation with its
peer in neighboring Belgium and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands have already started
setting up the necessary database as an intensified step in the
fight.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Carbomb Blasts at US Embassy in Tanzanian Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 8 (Xinhua) -- A powerful carbomb exploded
Friday morning at the entrance to the United States Embassy in the
Tanzanian capital, killing at least seven and injuring more than
50 Tanzanians.
</P>
<P>
The explosion happened at about 10:50 local time (0750 GMT) and
we felt a violent shake rocking the two-story building of the
Xinhua Bureau here like an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
We drove our Nissan Patrol out of the plot and saw sirening
ambulances in a row rushing toward the seaside residence district
for embassies, where a dense smoke can be seen rising against the
blue sky.
</P>
<P>
When we arrived at a three-story white building with a Stars
and Stripes flag waving on its top -- the Embassy of the United
States, a group of US marine soldiers, armed with automatic rifles
and wearing camouflage helmets and bullet-proof vests, began
posting a cordon together with the baton-waving Tanzanian
policemen.
</P>
<P>
Following the firemen, we managed to reach the center of the
blasting, where we saw several reception and guard rooms have been
leveled. The North-Eastern corner of the main building has fallen
into rubble, tongues of fire jumping around.
</P>
<P>
A dozen of cars and jeeps were left outside the cement bar of
the embassy, some of which are broken into pieces. Some vehicles
are burning, one with T116 (US Embassy) plate is still flashing
its emergency lights.
</P>
<P>
A car-sized and about 1.5 meter-deep pit can be seen clearly
among the damaged vehicles.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, this is the blasting center. It is a carbomb," a
Tanzanian police officer told us.
</P>
<P>
About 20 meters from the entrance, a bloody body without head
and a leg were seen on the grass. Farther away there lies a
broken hand, a bare right foot and several pieces of bleeding
flesh.
</P>
<P>
Many tall trees along the street outside the embassy were
broken in the middle part, leaving branches and dozens of green
papayas on the street.
</P>
<P>
The civilian houses surrounding the embassy also suffered
heavily. Some roofs were pulled off while others lost the walls,
leaking beds and chairs out.
</P>
<P>
The fire came under control finally when we were forced by the
plain clothed policemen to leave the site.
</P>
<P>
We droved at noon to the well-equipped Muhimbili Medical
Center where David Mwakyusa, spokesman for the hospital, told us
that 57 civilians, all Tanzanians, have so far been admitted and
six of them have died.
</P>
<P>
"An American, who was injured, refused the admission," he said.
</P>
<P>
When we left the hospital, an ambulance with a Red Cross flag
sirened in and was immediately surrounded by the Tanzanians who
wanted to identify whether their family members were inside.
</P>
<P>
A similar explosion has been reported attacking the US embassy
in Kenya's capital Nairobi almost at the same time, but on one has
claimed responsibility for the double attacks.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa Friday promised swift action to track down those
responsible for bombing U.S. embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania
and Nairobi, Kenya in coordinated attacks.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa, who arrived in Zimbabwe's western resort of Victoria
Falls for a two-day emergency summit of seven eastern and
southern African leaders to discuss the rebellion in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), said his government was
working with the U.S. embassy in Dar es Salaam to track down the
perpetrators of the crime.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to unearth all this. We are going to cooperate
with the U.S. embassy staff on this and when we do we are going
to take very stern measures indeed," Mkapa told journalists at
Victoria Falls Airport, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Five people were killed in the bomb attack in Dar es Salaam
which went off only minutes after a similar explosion in Kenya,
in which 40 were killed.
</P>
<P>
Also to arrive for the crisis summit were Rwandan President
Pasteur Bizimungu who came on the same presidential flight with
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba from Lusaka where he was on
an official visit.
</P>
<P>
Bizimungu, whose tiny country is blamed by its giant
neighbour, the DRC, of fomenting the Tutsi-led armed rebellion in
the east of the country, refused to answer questions from
journalists covering the summit.
</P>
<P>
Namibian President Sam Nujoma and host President Robert Mugabe
arrived earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Other leaders still to arrive on Friday evening were Uganda's
Yoweri Museveni, who broached the emergency summit idea to
discuss the worsening situation in the DRC, formerly Zaire,
Africa's third largest country.
</P>
<P>
DRC President Laurent Kabila, who came to power in May last
year after a seven-month Tutsi-led guerillar campaign, was
expected in Victoria Falls later in the evening.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Seeks Media Support for Prisoner Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Kuwaiti Information
Minister Yusef Mohammad Al-Sumait Friday called on Arab media to
help seek the release of Kuwaitis who have been jailed in Iraq for
seven years.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Lebanese journalists, Al-Sumait said
Kuwait is trying to turn to any media which enjoy international
influence and can help win the release of the Kuwaiti prisoners.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the Lebanese media, the freest in Arab countries,
can play a positive role.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti official arrived here Wednesday for a four-day
visit after trips to Egypt and Syria. He said his ongoing tour is
part of Kuwait's international campaign for the freedom of those
still being jailed.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has accused Iraq of holding more than 600 Kuwaitis since
the 1991 Gulf War which ended Iraq's seven-month-long occupation
of the sheikdom. Iraq, however, rejected the accusation.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sumait expressed Kuwait's support for Lebanon's resistance
against Israeli occupation of its southern territories, saying his
country will continue extending both material and moral support to
Lebanon's cause to recover occupied lands.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 after two invasions, to allegedly protect its
northern areas from cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sumait said that an exhibition on the sufferings and pains
of the Lebanese people inflicted by the Israeli occupation will be
open in Kuwait to evoke Kuwaiti people's sympathy and support for
the Lebanese people.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, the Kuwaiti minister has held talks with
Lebanese leaders and officials on regional affairs and bilateral
ties.

<P>
WUHAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese love and respect a hero
and those feelings can be even stronger when the hero faces even
greater difficulties than other heroes.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhancheng, a man in his late 60s who is handicapped, was
recently given a 10,000 yuan award by the city government of
Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, for the bravery he displayed
in saving the Yangtze River dykes.
</P>
<P>
On July 30, Wang, who has decades of experience in fighting
floods, used his own body to block a one meter hole on the city's
embankment he saw. Wang joined several young people and succeeded
in plugging the hole with sandbags after standing waist-deep in
the water for an hour and a half.
</P>
<P>
The provincial flood-control headquarters said that Wang's
bravery had in fact saved the dyke from a potentially disastrous
breach that could have affected the entire industrial area.
</P>
<P>
Wang is a retired employee of a local petrochemical company and
a skillful swimmer. But, the important thing is, to some he's been
a hero for decades. Wang was wounded during the War to Resist US
Aggression and Aid Korea (1950-53) and suffered damage to his
legs, but, 1954, he won a government award for his work in pulling
people out of raging floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
"I've fought floods for decades," Wang says simply, "and I'm
familiar with the dyke here," and adds, "I'm walking around the
dyke often, and it makes me feel good just looking over the dyke
and the water."

WASHINGTON, August 8 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton
Saturday vowed to hunt down and bring to justice those who were
responsible for the bombings of two U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"No matter how long it takes or where it takes us, we will
pursue terrorists until the cases are solved and justice is done,"
Clinton said in his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
"To turn our backs on those taking risks for peace, to weaken
our opposition to terrorism -- that would give terrorism a victory
it must not and will not have," the president said.
</P>
<P>
The Friday explosions at U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and
Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, killed at least 110 people, and the
number injured topped 2,200. The 11 Americans were killed in
Kenya, along with five Kenyan employees at the embassy.
</P>
<P>
The State Department has sent medical and other supplies as
well as investigators to the two countries. The FBI also
dispatched dozens of agents and bombing and evidence specialists
there.
</P>
<P>
Aircraft have taken off from the United States, Europe and
elsewhere in Africa bearing medical suplies and other equipment,
along with replacement personnel for the two embassies.

percent Israeli pullback, but the Palestinian side rejected it.
</P>
<P>
Israel proposed to hand over 10 percent, and turn the other 3
percent into a "nature reserve" to limit Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side demanded Israel accept the U.S. initiative
and withdraw from another 13.1 percent of the West Bank in the
second stage redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, the Palestinian side said they will not continue
such direct talks with Israel because it has nothing to offer.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said over the weekend
that it is up to Chairman Yasser Arafat to decide whether the
Palestinian side would continue the talks, but no official
statement was made so far.

HANGZHOU, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The fight against smuggling has

yuan worth of smuggled goods were seized from January 1997 to the
middle part of this year.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan, in a meeting here today with his Japanese counterpart
Masahiko Komura for talks on bilateral relations and regional and
global issues, said that Sino-Japanese ties are good in general
and that bilateral cooperation is moving forward.
</P>
<P>
Some problems can not be neglected, Tang said, and China
expects Japan to observe all principles on the Taiwan issue and to
be cautious in guarding Sino-Japanese ties.
</P>
<P>
This year is the 20th anniversary of the signing of the
Sino-Japanese Peace and Friendly Treaty, he said, and bilateral
relations are at a pivotal and important historic point.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin is scheduled to visit Japan this fall, he
pointed out, and this historic visit comes at the end of the
century and is expected to summerize both the positive and
negative experiences of Sino-Japanese ties and provide a blueprint
for long-term bilateral friendly and cooperative ties for the 21st
century. He also hopes that the two sides will step up
preparations to ensure Jiang's coming visit a success.
</P>
<P>
Komura expressed his sympathy for the serious flood problems in
central China and announced that there would be new aid for
China's disaster-stricken areas. He said that the new Japanese
cabinet places importance on relations with China and that his
visit to China not long after the new government was formed is a
sign of this.
</P>
<P>
He said that Jiang's visit will be the first paid by the head
of state of China and an important event in bilateral ties. He
said he believes it will lay a sound foundation for friendly ties
between the two countries and make new contribution to regional
and international peace and development.
</P>
<P>
He said he appreciates the efforts of the Chinese government
to keep its currency stable while increasing domestic reforms even
during this period of financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Tang said that China's stand is consistent and he
asked Japan's new government to take steps to improve domestic
economic stability and make a contribution to regional economic
revival.

<HEADLINE> One Chinese County Offers To Destroy Dykes To Save Major City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- While the county of Gong'an was
busy preparing a possible flood diversion scheme that could save
the city of Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei Province, another
county offered to blow up its dykes for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
The Jingjiang Flood Diversion Zone in Gong'an, 200 km upstream
from Wuhan, is set to be the first stage of a proposed diversion
program to discharge floodwater from the Yangtze River, and some
residents of Jingjiang were being evacuated to make way for the
diversion on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
So, the leaders of Jianli County, 150 km upstream from
Wuhan, volunteered their area as another site for a diversion to
share Gong'an's woes.
</P>
<P>
The flood situation in Hubei has not gotten much better, even
though the water level at the Shashi measuring point, 200 km
upstream from Wuhan, has been receding gradually. The water level
there fell to 44.8 m. at 6:00 p.m. Saturday and it is likely to
fall further in the coming hours, according to local hydrometric
departments, but the authorities are still considering the
diversion scheme for the safety of Wuhan, says one source.
</P>
<P>
The diversion would be carried out when the water level at
Shashi reaches 45 m. and is still going up. It would mean that a
part of Yangtze's embankments in Gong'an would be dynamited and
the North Flood Gate would be opened to discharge
floodwater.

<HEADLINE> Committee Set Up to Probe Conflict in Great Lakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Seven African leaders Saturday
decided to set up a four-member committee from among themselves
to immediately seek an end to the armed rebellion in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Addressing journalists at the end of the six-hour meeting in
Zimbabwe's western resort town of Victoria Falls, host President
Robert Mugabe said a committee of four summit participants had
been formed to immediately start work to ensure that fighting
stopped in the DRC where a Tutsi-inspired rebellion has been
raging since last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The committee comprises Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa,
Zambian President Fredrick Chiluba, Namibian President Sam Nujoma
and Mugabe as its chairman, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The meeting to tackle the escalating conflict in the Great
Lakes region was sponsored by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
and was chaired by Mugabe, with Chiluba, Mkapa, Nujoma, DRC
President Laurent Kabila and Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu
attending.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the meeting deliberated on the situation in the
Great Lakes region especially as it affected relations between
the DRC and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
He said the DRC was blaming Rwanda of inspiring fighting in
certain areas of the vast central African country especially the
eastern parts.
</P>
<P>
"The DRC has blamed Bwanda for invading its territory and some
groups have taken over some of the border towns," said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
But he added Rwanda on the contrary denied any involvement and
alleged that the conflict was an internal one brought about by
dissension and differences within the country.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said that the committee's first priority would be to
see that fighting stopped immediately.
</P>
<P>
He said they would establish who was fighting in the DRC,
whether they were Rwandan troops as alleged or the DRC army
rebels and whoever was doing the fighting should stop
immediately.
</P>
<P>
"We want the fighting to stop and therefore revert to
normalcy. It should go back to a situation of peace and peaceful
neighborliness," said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean president also said the leaders had condemned
in strongest terms the bombing that took place almost
simultaneously in Kenyan capital Nairobi and Tanzanian capital
Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said Africa would not stand by and allow its people to
be killed and whoever had perpetrated the act would be deemed as
an enemy of Africa and the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
The leaders are expected to leave for their respective
countries after the summit.

CHANGSHA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The flood situation in China's
Hunan Province got worse on Saturday as the water level in
Dongting Lake rose quickly to an all-time high, according to local
officials.
</P>
<P>
At 6:00 pm today, the water level at Chenglingji, where the
lake joins the Yangtze River, was 35.5 m., 0.24 m. above the

As the year's fourth flood crest continues to move downstream
in the direction of Hunan, the water level is expected to rise

</P>
<P>
Governor Yang Zhengwu told Xinhua that the local dykes have
been weakened by a month-long assault by the high water and the
situation could turn perilous at any time.
</P>

The province's battle with the flood has entered a crucial
stage, he said, and there are more than 2 million people,
including thousands of soldiers and armed police, involved in it.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean commercial banks have
started to increase lending rates following the hike in the
rediscount rate by the Reserve Bank this week to shore up the
Zimbabwean Dollar which took a knock against major currencies.
</P>
<P>
Three banks have increased their rates by a minimum of three
percentage points following the raising of the rediscount rate by
the central bank from 31.5 percent to 35 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
The rediscount rate is the rate at which banks borrow money
from the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe increased its interest rates
on all loans and overdrafts by 3.5 percent per annum while the
bank's minimum lending rate moved up from 35 percent to 38.5
percent per annum.
</P>
<P>

upward revision of the rediscount rate," the bank said in a
statement Saturday.

<P>
Two other banks, First Bank and Stanbic Zimbabwe also raised
their prime lending rates to 38.5 percent and 38 percent per
annum respectively.
</P>
<P>
"Our credit interest rates will also be adjusted upwards with
effect from August 7, 1998," Stanbic said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The reserve bank hiked the rediscount rate in a bid to
stabilize the Zimbabwean Dollar which fell by about 12 percent
Monday under heavy speculative pressure from importers.
</P>
<P>
However, the pressure has since subsided and the Zimbabwean
Dollar closed the week stable trading at between 21 and 22
Zimbabwean Dollars to one U.S. Dollar.
</P>
<P>
But the raising of the rediscount rate has the effect of
making borrowings from banks by businesses and individuals
expensive as they also raise their lending rates.

<HEADLINE> Pak Foreign Ministry Officials Discuss Afghan Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 8 (Xinhua) -- High-ranking officials from
Pakistan's Foreign Ministry held emergent consultations Saturday
on the latest Afghan situation after the Taliban militia marched
into the opposition stronghold of Mazar-i-Sharif, official sources
said.
</P>
<P>
No official word was available about the outcome of the
meeting. However, the sources said that Pakistan reiterated
that it will stick to its policy towards the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan was the first country to have recognized the Taliban
government when they briefly entered Mazar-i-Sharif, the strategic
northern Afghan town in May 1997 after they struck a deal with
opposition commander General Abdul Malik.
</P>
<P>
However, the ethnic Hazara flushed the Taliban militia out of
the northern town killing hundreds of Taliban soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban Saturday claimed to have overrun the opposition
stronghold of Mazar-i-Sharif, the only major Afghan town which was
beyond the Taliban's control, after three hours of fierce fighting
with the rival Northern Alliance.
</P>
<P>
The chief representative of the Taliban based in Islamabad,
Abdul Hakeem Mujahid, said that the Taliban leadership in the
southern town of Kandahar has confirmed the fall of the town.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Condemns African Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon on Saturday strongly
condemned the terrorist bombings next to the United States'
embassies in the two African countries of Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
In a telegram sent to U.S. President Bill Clinton, Lebanese
President Elias Hrawi said that terrorism will never obstruct the
U.S. from continuing its fresh efforts in a bid to achieve peace
and stability in the world.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, two bombs blasted with minutes of each other in
Nairobi, Kenya and Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, apparently targeting
the U.S. embassies.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 have died, eight of them Americans, and over
1,000 injuried in the two bombings. Clinton has vowed to "use all
the means at our disposal to bring those responsible to justice,
no matter what or how long it takes."
</P>
<P>
During the day, Hrawi also sent messages to his Kenyan and
Tanzania counterparts Daniel arap Moi and Benjamin William Mkapa
to express condolence.
</P>
<P>
He denounced the bombings as a coward terrorist act and thus
unjustifiable.
</P>
<P>
He added that the act is intended against not only
U.S. interests but also international human rights and stability.
</P>
<P>
Less than two months ago a similar bomb blast occurred near the
U.S. embassy in Beirut in which no casualties were caused. But the
case is still under investigation.

<HEADLINE> Poverty to Hit 40 Percent of Indonesians: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Poverty is expected to hit 40
percent of Indonesia's more than 200 million population this year,
a senior minister said.
</P>
<P>
The figure is up from only 11.4 percent in 1996, Coordinating
Minister for People's Welfare and Poverty Eradication Haryono
Suyono said while opening a national meeting on total reforms in
Medan, North Sumatra, Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Poverty has already hit some 11.4 million families across the
country, Antara News Agency quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the main cause of the increase of poverty was the
monetary crisis which has lasted for more than one year.
</P>
<P>
The crisis, which was described as the worst in the past 30
years, has made people lose confidence in government leaders and
institutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
In facing the crisis, he said, people should again participate
and encourage others to participate in development efforts.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has expected the economy to contract
by 15 percent this year, but it was optimistic that the country
will record a positive growth in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry
Ginandjar Kartasamita said earlier the country's inflation, which
is estimated to reach 80 percent this year, is expected to fall
into single digit by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Singapore PM  Calls for Unity to Meet Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong Saturday called upon the whole nation to rally together
and meet the most formidable challenges since independence in
1965.
</P>
<P>
In a national day message to mark the country's 33rd
independence anniversary which falls on August 9, Goh Chok Tong
said, "Let us rally together and meet the challenge head-on.
United we will prevail, and emerge stronger than before."
</P>
<P>
While giving a bleak picture about the regional situation, Goh
Said the regional crisis is a challenge to all Singaporeans and in
economic terms the problems the country is facing are more serious
than the oil-shock of 1973, or the recession in 1985 in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
According to the prime minister, Singapore's economic growth
fell to 1.6 percent in the second quarter from the same period
last year, the Singapore dollar has depreciated by some 20 percent
against the U.S. dollar, external demand for Singapore-made goods
and services has dropped sharply, and some companies have had to
retrench workers.
</P>
<P>
Go Chok Tong said that for the first time in many years the
country's budget will be in deficit this year and there will be
another budget deficit next year.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has taken a series of moves including
measures to reduce business costs, to attract investments, and to
train and retrain everyone to his full potential.
</P>
<P>
Comparing the task facing the country to competing in the World
Cup that ended in France about a month ago, the prime minister
stressed "the key to our long-term competitiveness is first the
collective skills of our people, and the next how well we
organize ourselves."

WASHINGTON, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Bombs exploded outside the United States embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania, killing at least 80 people, eight of them Americans,
in what appeared to be coordinated terrorist attacks. In
Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton condemned the attacks as
abhorrent, and he vowed to bring those responsible to justice "no
matter what or how long it takes."
</P>
<P>
-- A Federal Judge has found that prosecutors investigating
President Bill Clinton's relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky may
have violated Federal rules by providing ground jury testimony to
journalists, and that the independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr may
have broken the ethical code governing criminal investigations in
his remarks to reporters.
</P>
<P>
Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- When the now-vacationing 105th Congress returns for a final
flurry of work before the November elections, it is not likely to
produce many notable laws. But it will generate plenty of noise:
arguments over spending priorities, health care, tax cuts and
campaign finance -- even dire threats of another government
shutdown and recriminations over who's to blame.
</P>
<P>
-- Anti-government forces seized more territory Friday in their
bid to oust President Laurent Kabila, and Congolese troops
scouring the capital city Kinshasa for Tutsi rebels forced their
way into the U.S. embassy compound Thursday night.

bloodshed in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Friday by the Foreign Ministry said that
"We are deeply concerned with the continuing violence and clashes
in Kosovo, which have led to mass waves of refugees. The fact that
the operations of the Yugoslav security forces (in Kosovo) that
have led to such grave consequences as mass graves provokes a deep
anger in the Turkish public."
</P>
<P>
The statement emphasized that insensitivity to the situation
in Kosovo is unacceptable. It called on the international
community and organizations to immediately accelerate efforts
aimed at ending the violence in Kosovo and find a peaceful
solution.
</P>
<P>
"A non-conditional and substantial dialog, based on the
principles of the United Nations and the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) should be initiated as
soon as possible," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the settlement process should include
representatives of all peoples in Kosovo, including the Turkish
minority, and should be aimed at establishing a democratic and
pluralist administration which would guarantee the legitimate
rights of all people in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has deep-rooted historical, humanitarian and cultural
ties with Kosovo and a considerable number of Turks are still
living in the region.
</P>
<P>
Since February, fierce fighting has erupted between the
Serbian forces and ethnic Albanian guerrillas who demand
independence from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The bloodshed has claimed many innocent lives and led to a
large number of refugees.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Storms into Opposition Stronghold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
launched a major attack on Mazar-i-Sharif, the stronghold of the
anti-Taliban Northern Alliance Saturday morning, and stormed into
the city after breaking through the opposition defenses.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Hakeem Mujahid, chief representative of the Taliban
militia based in Islamabad, told Xinhua that he had received
reports that the Taliban had taken full control of Mazar-i-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Taliban sources from Mazar-i-Sharif also said that their forces
had secured full control over the dusty opposition bastion.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that a total of 5,000 Taliban troops took part
in Saturday's fighting which started from Daulatabad area, about
40 kilometers north of the city. The Taliban entered the city
after mid-day following hours of intense fighting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to media reports reaching here from
Mazar-i-Sharif Saturday afternoon, the bulk of opposition forces
were fleeing south to the mountainous central Massif of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Iranian News Agency, IRNA, said that
Mazar-i-Sharif, the only major Afghan city which was beyond the
Taliban's control, has been totally over-run by the Taliban
militia.
</P>
<P>
"The city fell moments ago and repeated explosions are being
heard in the city," IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
"There are only pockets of resistance, alliance officials have
left the town and people too are fleeing," it said, adding that
"parts of Mazar-i-Sharif are now burning and many homes have been
destroyed."
</P>
<P>
Taliban sources said that they used jet planes, conducting air
raids against the military targets of the Northern Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Relief agencies have already withdrawn from the city in fear of
 fighting after the Taliban captured Shiberghan, capital of
Jawzjan province last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It is the second time that the Taliban has entered
Mazar-i-Sharif. The Taliban seized control of the city in May 1997
after joining ranks with Abdul Malik, a former ally of opposition
warlord Abdul Rashid Dostam, who allowed them to enter the
stronghold.
</P>
<P>
However, when a deal over power sharing broke down, Malik
returned to the fold of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance to
inflict a brutal killing on at least 2,500 Taliban soldiers
trapped in the north.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 8 (Xinhua) -- World champions Maurice Greene
and Ato Boldon will pull out of Wednesday's Zurich grand prix
meeting on the grounds that organizers changed their contract
terms, the athletes manager said in Irvine, California, on Friday
night in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Based on the continuation of inconstant financial agreements
and a pervasive lack of athlete appreciation during these
negotiations, both Greene and Boldon plan to return to the United
States following Saturday's meet in Monte Carlo," their manager
Emanuel Hudson said.
</P>
<P>
Greene was quoted as saying in the statement: "This isn't about
money or we would all be running exclusively for the Golden
League's one million dollars jackpot. This is about respect and
acknowledgment. We didn't feel either based on the terms they
offered us."
</P>
<P>
Greene recently defeated a world-class 100-meters field at the
Goodwill Games and training partner Boldon, the world 200-meters
champion, won the 200 meters there.

WARSAW, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Poland's sports authorities and
soccer federation reached a compromise late on Friday minutes
before a FIFA deadline threatening to ban Polish teams from
international competition.
</P>
<P>
Sports minister Jacek Debski said that he had informed FIFA

The announcement came 14 minutes before a midnight deadline

</P>
<P>
The controversy was sparked in April when the PZPN refused to
let sports ministry inspectors investigate their financial records
for suspected irregularities.
</P>
<P>
Debski responded the following month by sacking almost the
entire 30-member association board.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on
Saturday called on Iran to sink a feud with Iraq and start
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He made the call in his nationally broadcast speech on the 10th
anniversary of the ending of the 8-year Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
"If some quarters in Iran abandoned what was not praiseworthy
of the past, they would see and find that the Arabs, including
Iraq, had abandoned this and left it long time ago," said the
Iraqi president.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that Iran "will also find every righteous,
beneficial cooperation from the Arabs, first and foremost, Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Saddam also called on Iran not to become a tool in the hand of
foreigner to harm Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The Arabs, including Iraqis, hope and call upon the officials
and peoples of Iran not to become a tool in the hands of the
covetous foreigner to harm Arabs, primarily Iraq," he said.
</P>
<P>
Between 1980-1988, Iran and Iraq fought a bitter war due to
border disputes, leaving 1 million of people dead or wounded.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the two countries have stepped up efforts to solve
outstanding issues that have been standing in the way to the
normalization of relations.
</P>
<P>
In April, they repatriated some 6,000 of prisoners of war
(POWs) and detainees and promised to solve this issue of POWs
completely in the near future.
</P>
<P>
In June, they sent people to each other's territories to
search for those missing in action (MIA).

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Deputy Prime
Minister for Development Jawad Anani has said Jordan hopes
relations between Iran and the United States will be improved
through direct talks.
</P>
<P>
Anani, who is also foreign minister and is due in Tehran later
Saturday for a visit, made the remark in an interview with the
Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Rai Al-Aam published Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said Amman was in favor of a rapprochement between Iran and
the United States as it would eventually affect positively the
relations between Iran and Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his belief that Washington and Tehran could
establish mutual understanding through direct dialog.
</P>
<P>
But Anani hinted that Washington should abandon the containment
strategy in its dealings with Iran.
</P>
<P>
He also confirmed during the interview that his scheduled talks
with Iranian officials would deal with the issue of possessing
mass-destruction weapons.
</P>
<P>
Jordan does not want Iran to be target of accusations
concerning the development of weapons of mass-destruction while
Israel claims the right to do so, Anani said. "We do not want
Israel to continue the development of mass-destruction arms," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said it was in the interest of his country and other Arab
states to hear the opinion of the Iranian leaders about the
possession of these weapons.
</P>
<P>
Anani's visit to Iran will be the first by a high ranking
Jordanian official since last year, when Jordan's Crown Prince
Hassan Ibn Talal traveled to Tehran to attend the summit of the
Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC).

<HEADLINE> Fourth Flood Crest Passes Through Central Chinese City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The fourth flood crest on the
Yangtze River passed through the city of Yichang in Hubei Province
early this morning.
</P>
<P>
The city's 267 km of embankments remained intact, according to
reports today.
</P>
<P>
Because of torrential rains on the river's upper reaches, the
river was flowing at 61,500 cu.m. per second when the peak
approached Yichang around 10:00 p.m. yesterday.
</P>
<P>
An hour later, the crest joined water from the Qingjiang River
and headed downstream at an even bigger rate of flow, raising the
water level of the river below Yichang to above the danger mark.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the safety of the dykes, especially on the Jingjiang
section, the secretary of the Yichang City Communist Party
Committee, Tian Zhenya, and the city's Mayor Sun Zhigang got
thousands of government employees and 40,000 residents and
soldiers to work on the embankments through the night.
</P>
<P>
After a 24-hour fight, they managed to stop several cave-ins
along the embankment before the fourth flood crest hit.
</P>
<P>
Water levels at Yichang went down slowly today, and by 5:00
p.m. today, they were down to 53.21 m., down 0.7 m. from the
highest level, and the flow rate was down to 56,600 cu.m. per
second, down 4,900 cu.m. from the highest rate.

At the 16-day event, a series of colorful activities will be
staged, such as cooking with master chefs, gourmet dining around
Hong Kong, waiters' competition and food bazaar, according to the
organizer, the Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA).
</P>
<P>
With one restaurant for every 720 residents, Hong Kong is known
as the culinary capital of Asia, where gourmets can find cuisine
ranging from Cantonese to Shanghainese, from Mexican to
Mediterranean, and from Korean to Indonesian.
</P>
<P>
Since it was launched in 1986, the food festival has been
closely tied to the promotion of Hong Kong tourism, Y S Lo,

</P>
<P>
Newly added to this year's festival are special culinary tours,
which help people gain an understanding of the traditional aspects
of Chinese life related to food. Participants in the Healthy
Living Tour, for instance, can watch performance of Qigong
exercise, visit a herbalist's store and eat a healthy meal.

<HEADLINE> HK Gov't Helps SMEs Cope With Economic Adjustment: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Small and medium enterprises
(SMEs) are the backbone of Hong Kong's economy and it is
government's objective to provide a favorable environment
conducive to their development, Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa said
here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's economy is experiencing painful adjustment. But
after this adjustment, the SMEs will play the role of an engine in
our economic revival," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive met Saturday with a group of SME
practitioners and entrepreneurs to exchange views on the current
and future development of SMEs. They included exporters and
operators from catering, toy, garment and technology industries.
</P>
<P>
There are over 290,000 SMEs in Hong Kong, which constitute
about 98 percent of all enterprises in the services and
manufacturing sectors. They employ about 1.4 million workers,
representing 60 percent of the workforce.
</P>
<P>
Tung told the entrepreneurs that the Special Finance Scheme to
provide funding and guarantees for loans for SMEs was part of the
relief measures announced by his government on June 22 to ease
Hong Kong's economic adjustment. The scheme was aimed at helping
SMEs cope with the liquidity crunch problem.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Committee of the Legislative Council approved a
commitment of 2.5 billion HK dollars (321 million U.S. dollars)
for establishing the scheme last month. The government is now
inviting the authorized institutions under the Banking Ordinance
to participate in the scheme.
</P>
<P>
"My colleagues in the Trade and Industry Bureau and Industry
Department are making sure that loan facilities will be made
available by the market sector before the end of the month," Tung
noted.
</P>
<P>
"The entrepreneurs in Hong Kong are renowned for their
adaptability and responsiveness to changes. I have confidence
that with the relief in liquidity, the SMEs will come up with new
business strategies to cope with the changing market environment
and continue making significant contribution to Hong Kong's
economy," the chief executive added.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Vows to Track Terrorists in US Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Vice-President
Omar Ali Juma said Saturday morning that his country will
cooperate with the United States in tracking those who are
responsible for the bombing of the U.S. embassy in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president made the remarks during a tour to the
embassy which was wrecked by a horrifying bomb at about 10:45
a.m. Friday which left at least seven people dead and more than
70 others injured.
</P>
<P>
An initial investigation by the Tanzanian police showed that
the bomb was planted on an oil tanker belonging to the embassy.
</P>
<P>
Traffic around the heavily-guarded embassy compound has come
back to normal. The atmosphere is still tense with Tanzanian
policemen and soldiers standing on alert outside the embassy.
</P>
<P>
It is not immediately known whether the U.S. special
investigation team has arrived or not.
</P>
<P>
Several patients admitted into the Muhimbili Medical Center
have been transferred to private hospitals, medical sources said.
</P>
<P>
Simeon Ileta, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
and International Cooperation, said a statement will come out
later on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports reaching here said President Benjamin Mkapa
has condemned the bomb explosion.
</P>
<P>
It was "horrible and despicable," the president said Friday in
northern Zimbabwe, where he was joining six other African leaders
for a summit on the crisis concerning the Democratic Republic of
Congo.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to try to unearth who is behind this... When we
do, we are going to take stern measures indeed," said Mpaka.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the state-owned paper Daily News said that Prime
Minister Frederick Sumaye has categorically dissociated the event
with the relationship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"I assure the American friends that Tanzania values the
existing good relations between the two nations and would work
out toward consolidating the ties," he said at the National
Assembly Friday in the central city of Dodoma.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye assured that the Tanzanian government will thoroughly
investigate into the incident and take actions against the
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye said the bombing, which occurred almost simultaneously
with another one near the U.S. embassy in Kenyan capital Nairobi,
was "a work of foreign hired mercenaries."
</P>
<P>
The premier on behalf of the entire government paid tribute to
all victims of the incident which has been the first of its kind
in the country.
</P>
<P>
He asked the National Assembly to condemn at their full length
the incident and called on people to remain calm as the state is
doing everything to establish its cause.

Mozambique, the Mozambican said, adding that it will also boost
the development of animal raising and rice growing.
</P>
<P>
Rosario called on Mauritian investors to comply with their
commitments as written in the agreement and to solve various
problems through dialog.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the workers in the sugar plants to exert their
efforts to restore production.
</P>
<P>
The two sugar plants have been out of use since 1986 when war
broke out in the poor country.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican minister said that his government is trying to
rehabilitate all the sugar plants damaged by the war and to
ensure that the country can sustain without sugar imports with
its own sugar output reaching 310,000 tons by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Mozambique has to import some 120,000 tons of sugar
each year and it produces only 35,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Mauritian Minister of Agriculture, Fishery and Cooperation
Alvin Boolell pledged that his government will invest more into
the sugar industry in Mozambique, saying that this is beneficial
to both nations.
</P>
<P>
The transferred sugar plant, renamed as Compannia de Sena,
SARL, needs an investment of 70 million U.S. Dollars. It will
begin to produce sugar by the year of 2001, creating 5,000 jobs.

<HEADLINE> China on DPP Attempt to Undermine Cross-Strait Relations (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The pompous allegation some
members of Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) have voiced
concerning the death of Lin Ti-chuan have mislead people on the
island province and sabotaged cross-straits relations, according
to a Xinhua commentator's article released today.
</P>
<P>
The commentator's article points to the DPP's irresponsible
remarks on Lin's case, and specifically rebukes the Taiwan party's
successive attacks concerning security and social stability on the
mainland, as well as its totally-misguided comments concerning the
mainland's indifference over the life and property of compatriots
from the island province, and the issue of human rights.
</P>
<P>
The DPP has pledged to press Taiwan authorities to suspend
cross-straits exchanges and require Koo Chen-fu, president of the
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), to cancel his anticipated visit
to the mainland in September, according to the commentary.
</P>
<P>
The article notes that the DPP enaged in repeated attempts to
send personnel to the Chinese mainland along with Lin's family.
</P>
<P>
DPP members have failed to comfort and assist the Lin's family,
and instead attempted to act as "the family's negotiators with the
Communist Party of China," meanwhile attempting to disrupt their
direct negotiations with concerned departments, says the
article. It goes on to acknowledge that the DPP's sole purpose is
to sway public opinions and create the illusion that "the Chinese
government failed to respect the will of Lin's family" and
instigate an emotional response from Taiwan compatriots.
</P>
<P>
The DPP urged the Taiwan law enforcement department and SEF
personnel to visit the scene of tragedy "to help conduct both
preliminary and follow-up investigations involving the case," so
as to prompt what the Taiwan party termed "diplomatic functions
between the two countries" and so-called "consular assistance".

<HEADLINE> Chittagong to Be Turned to Industrial, Commercial Hub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Chittagong Development
Authority (CDA) of Bangladesh has undertaken a five-year master
plan (1998-2002) to implement 34 projects with a view to turning
the city into an industrial and commercial hub.
</P>
<P>
All the projects with an estimated cost of 4.74 billion taka
(about 100.9 million U.S. dollars) included construction and
widening of five roads and development of four housing projects,
said media reports Saturday quoting CDA Chairman M. Zakaria as
saying recently.
</P>
<P>
The master plan was prepared in 1995 by the UNDP (United
Nations Development Program) in collaboration with the UNCHS
(United Nations Center for Human Settlements) and reviewed by a
12-member multi-sectoral experts under the guidelines issued by
the city mayor.
</P>
<P>
On the potentialities of Chittagong in the fields of economic
development, the CDA chief said that basic infrastructure
development and creation of congenial atmosphere was imperative to
attract foreign and local investment, the CDA chief stressed.
</P>
<P>
He underscored the importance of better coordination between
all agencies and public utility-service organizations for building
up the Chittagong city in a planned and pragmatic way.
</P>
<P>
Chittagong, 224 kilometers southeast of Dhaka, is the second
largest city and the biggest sea-port in South Asia.

<HEADLINE> China on DPP Attempt to Undermine Cross-Strait Relations (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As to the reason that some DPP members made use of such a
criminal case resultant from from a business dispute between the
people across the Taiwan Straits, the article attributes it to
their obstinate adherence to the stance of "Taiwan independence."
</P>
<P>
They always want to seize a chance to land the mainland into a
position of "an antagonistic country," act as "heroes" to obtain
more votes, and pass themselves off as "the oppressed" to win the
sympathy of the international community, the article says.
</P>
<P>
In fact, their acts have gone against the will of the people
of Taiwan and drawn strong negative response from the people on
the island, the article says, quoting some Taiwan people as saying
that the DPP has no right to prohibit the cross-strait exchanges
and turn the case of Lin Ti-chuan into a political issue.
</P>
<P>
Some DPP members showed their disagreement to the party's
mishandling of Lin's case, saying that the decade-long
cross-strait exchanges cannot be suspended, it says.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, The article adds, the relevant department in the
mainland has taken into full account Lin's family's opinions when
dealing with the unfortunate incident, and this has won the
recognition of most Taiwan compatriots.
</P>
<P>
However, some DPP members are still bent on plotting to incite
the feelings of Taiwan compatriots against the mainland by taking
the advantage of the return of Lin's remains to Taiwan, the
article says, adding that their attempt to make trouble in
cross-strait relations will surely end with failure.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's ZCCM Mines Sale Terms Under Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
appointed a committee to improve the conditions which have been
set out earlier for the sale of its Zambia Consolidated Copper
Mines (ZCCM).
</P>
<P>
The committee is expected to draw up a plan that will speed up
the sale of the remaining ZCCM assets, notably Nchanga and Nkana
mines, which register 65 percent of Zambia's copper output,
Zambia Daily Mail reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The plan will be submitted to the ZCCM board of directors
within 14 days and later be forwarded to the government for final
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
The monentum in the sale of the assets has been slowed down by
breakdown of the negotiations in the past months which have
sometimes left the conglomerate's future uncertain.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Mines Minister Syamukayumbu Syamujaye as
saying in Lusaka Friday that the committee's main task will be to
draw up an action plan that would entice ZCCM buyers worldwide
and look at ways of marketing the mines internationally.
</P>
<P>
He also said that even in biddership, there should be ways to
keep the mines viable so that they continue generating funds on
the internaitonal market.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government is interested in speeding the mines's
privatisation process and wants ZCCM to clear the local and
foreign suppliers it owes money, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Zambian government with 60.3 percent shares
of the copper mines would like a successful completion of the
privatisation process, which is a precondition set for the
country to get 530 million U.S. Dollars pledged by western donors
last May.

<HEADLINE> Small Part of Jiujiang City Submerged by Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JIUJIANG, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Some four sq km of urban
Jiujiang, in east China's Jiangxi Province, has been submerged by
floodwater gushing in from a breach of the city's flood defense
embankment, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
The city proper of Jiujiang, an industrial center and tourist
attraction located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze with an
urban population of about 500,000, has an area of about 30 sq km.
</P>
<P>
A 40-m-long breach occured Friday afternoon on the dike as
floods kept surging in the Yangtze River. But due to a mechanical
mishap in the process of refitting the embankment caused by a
power cut and to inadequate supply of filling materials like
rocks, stone and sand, the breach widened to 60 meters this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Currently, efforts are being intensified to re-settle affected
residents. Governor Shu Shengyou said that there were no reported
casualties yet in the breach by this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"The situation caused by the breach is expected to be brought
under control this evening," Shu told Xinhua, noting that life has
been by and large normal in urban Jiujiang.
</P>
<P>
So far, supplies of running water, electricity and daily
necessities have been adequate as usual in the city.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of local residents, along with soldiers, have been
working hard to plug up the breach for the past 30 hours,
including sinking eight boats loaded with rock, as well as
thousands of tons of rice, coal, soybeans, into the breached
section.

Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- At least 81 dead and 1,700 injured in the two car bomb attacks
in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam which targeted the United States in the
heart of Africa. No claim has been made so far for the two attacks
which caused a carnage.
</P>
<P>

over the past five years. However, the violence has not troubled the
apathy of the local population.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The Islamist trail is privileged for the bombing attacks on
U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam on Friday. In the wake
of threats announced by the Egyptian fundamentalist group Islamic
Jihad, the suspicion is focused on this group. The arrest of a
suspect ``wearing Arab garments'' near the scene in Nairobi
reinforced the hypothesis.
</P>
<P>
-- Twenty cases of ``malady legionnaire'' have been diagnosed in
Paris since the beginning of June. Four people, including three

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Countrymen Suggested to Pawn Valuables </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Saturday suggested that Malaysians pawn their
valuables such as jewelry abroad and use the money to help raise
more domestic capital resources for economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir made the suggestion when opening the 52nd general
assembly of the Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC) in Petaling Jaya
near here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The MIC, one of the 14 members of the ruling Barisan Nasional
(BN) (National Front) of which he is also the chairman, is the
BN's third largest component, representing the Indian community in
the country which accounts for some 8 percent of Malaysia's
population of about 21 million.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that there is hidden wealth worth billions of
dollars in the country," Mahathir said, adding by suggesting so,
he was not asking Malaysians to make outright national
contributions but only pawn their valuables overseas for cash as
an interim measure pending Malaysia's recovery from the current
economic problems.
</P>
<P>
"We want to increase our capital. This is one way of helping
the country without losing anything for yourself," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said "When our economy gets better, we can bring back the
jewelry from overseas."
</P>
<P>
The funds derived by pawning the valuables could be used in
efforts towards dealing with the economic downturn, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said by pawning their jewelry and other valuables,
Malaysians would display high patriotism in helping overcome the
country's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the government would work very hard to improve
the economy so that those who have pawned their valuables overseas
could redeem them.
</P>
<P>
The one-day MIC assembly, attended by 1,350 delegates, was
expected to deliberate on efforts towards national economic
recovery and galvanizing teamwork among the Indian community to
join the government towards that end.
</P>
<P>
MIC President Samy Vellu, who is also Works Minister, called on
Malaysians to bolster solid support for Mahathir's stewardship of
the country in dealing with the current economic problems.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on
Saturday called on Iran to sink a feud with Iraq and start
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He made the call in his nationally broadcast speech on the 10th
anniversary of the ending of the 8-year Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
"If some quarters in Iran abandoned what was not praiseworthy
of the past, they would see and find that the Arabs, including
Iraq, had abandoned this and left it long time ago," said the
Iraqi president.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that Iran "will also find every righteous,
beneficial cooperation from the Arabs, first and foremost, Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Saddam also called on Iran not to become a tool in the hand of
foreigner to harm Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The Arabs, including Iraqis, hope and call upon the officials
and peoples of Iraq not to become a tool in the hands of the
covetous foreigner to harm Arabs, primarily Iraq," he said.
</P>
<P>
Between 1980-1988, Iran and Iraq fought a bitter war due to
border disputes, leaving 1 million of people dead or wounded.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the two countries have stepped up efforts to solve
outstanding issues that have been standing in the way to the
normalization of relations.
</P>
<P>
In April, they repatriated some 6,000 of prisoners of war
(POWs) and detainees and promised to solve this issue of POWs
completely in the near future.
</P>
<P>
In June, they sent people to each other's territories to
search for those missing in action (MIA).

NAIROBI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
said the confirmed death toll from bomb blast at the U.S. embassy
in downtown Nairobi has reached 83 with a further 2,140 people
injured.
</P>
<P>
"As of this morning, 83 people have been confirmed dead, 497
have been admitted to various hospitals while 1,543 have been
treated and discharged," Moi said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Some people are still trapped under the debris of the
collapsed Ufundi (-Cooperative) building and efforts are being
made to rescue them," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
However, resue workers on the scene said the death toll will
still rise sharply and exceed 100.
</P>
<P>
A man trapped in the debris was found dead around 10:00 a.m.
Saturday. At least another was believed to be still alive under
the rubble but the rescue team has not found the person's exact
position.
</P>
<P>
International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) spokeswoman Nina
Golbe told Xinhua Saturday morning that another six bodies of
people were found overnight from the rubbles.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of rescue workers, making shifts, worked the whole
night on the rubbles but so far as the ICRC knows, only seven
people were found, six of them already dead, Golbe said.
</P>
<P>
The seventh, a Kenyan man, was found to be still alive but
serious injured when he was pulled out of the debris.
</P>
<P>
The rescue work was expected to last several days.
</P>
<P>
Eight Americans, including two women and one child, were
killed by the bombing and another 15 wounded with one still
missing, U.S. embassy spokesman Chris Scharf told Xinhua Friday
evening.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Prundence Bushnell was seen to be taken out
into an ambulance vehicle minutes after the blast. She was
believed to be injured slightly but now the U.S. embassy said she
is OK and presiding over meetings.
</P>
<P>
U.S. medical and forensic experts arrived in the Kenyan
capital on Saturday as Washington launched an urgent
investigation into deadly car bomb attacks on two of its east
African embassies.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan police said they are probing the bomb blast which

<HEADLINE> Iran to Close 7 Diplomatic Missions Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Iran has decided to close seven
diplomatic missions abroad, mainly in Africa, in line with the
government's austerity plan, local daily Tehran Times reported on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The seven missions to be closed down are Iranian embassies in
Sierra Leone, Burkina Faso, Tanzania, Gabon, Nicaragua,
Afghanistan and Iranian consulate in Hyderabad, India, the daily
said, adding the staff from the Iranian consulate in Turkey's
Trabuzan will be also reduced.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Times, which was believed to be close to the Foreign
Ministry, quoted an informed source as saying that following an
austerity plan, the country would close the diplomatic missions
with immediate effect, which "economically and politically are not
viable."
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi announced on
Wednesday that the ministry would close down a number of Iranian
missions abroad and reduce their staff in order to help the
government slash spendings.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to close our diplomatic missions in countries
which do not have very friendly relations with Iran and those
which do not have significant economic cooperation with our
country," Mohammadi said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came days after reports said that the country
would face a foreign exchange deficit of about 3.5 billion
U.S. dollars in the current Iranian year (starting from March 21)
since its foreign exchange revenue would be decreased to 9 billion
dollars from 14 billion dollars last Iranian year.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami Sunday announced a package
of plans to rehabilitate the country's ailing oil-dependent
economy, saying that the government was facing mounting pressures
due to a sharp decrease in revenue as a result of oil price fall
during the past year.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the Iranian people would tolerate
more pressure in order to help the government solve economic
bottlenecks.
</P>
<P>
However, Tehran Times said that some officials were against
the decision to fully close those diplomatic missions and they
believed Iran's presence across the world was a must to air the
message and spirit of the Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
At this crucial juncture when Burkina Faso, the current
Chairman of the Organization of the African Unity, is playing a
central role for the African affairs, the closure of the Iranian
embassy in Ouagadougou is not good, the daily quoted an observer
as saying.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Deputy PM Visits Iran to Enhance Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister
Jawad Anani left here Saturday for Tehran on an official visit
aimed at improving the bilateral ties after a 3-year period of
cold relations.
</P>
<P>
"After a break of several years, we believe that with the new
political leadership in Iran, the time is ripe to develop and
enhance bilateral ties on all levels,`` Anani, the prime minister
for development affairs, said earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Anani, also the foreign minister, is expected
to deliver a good-will message from King Hussein of Jordan to
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami and invite him to pay an
official visit to the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
He will also meet his Iranian counterpart Kamal Kharrazi and
other officials to discuss means of political and economic
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Among the issues to be raised with Iranian officials are
Iranian-Arab relations, elimination of mass-destruction weapons in
the Middle East, as well as the Arab-Israeli peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We will also discuss how to increase trade volume between the
two nations. We shall explore the industrial fields where we can
launch joint ventures," Anani said.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a joint venture to produce phosphate
fertilizer in Jordan to be mostly exported to Iran is on the
agenda of both sides' talks, according to Anani.
</P>
<P>
Tehran severed its diplomatic ties with Amman during the
8-year-old Iraqi-Iranian war on a perceived tilt of the kingdom
over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic ties between Jordan and Iran were resumed in
the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
However, in 1995 Jordan expelled the first secretary at the
Iranian Embassy Saeed Batini, charging him of "performing acts
that contradicted with his diplomatic status."
</P>
<P>
The ties between the two countries have cooled down since
then.
</P>
<P>
Both sides exchanged official visits in the past few years in
efforts to enhance bilateral ties, but the effect was limited.
</P>
<P>
After the moderate Khatami was elected Iranian president last
year, things began to turn for the better. Tehran`s ties were
enhanced not only with Jordan, but also with most of the Arab
states.
</P>
<P>
Last November, Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan visited Iran to
attend the Organization of Islamic Conference meetings, during
which he met Khatami and other senior officials.

<HEADLINE> Victims of Nairobi Bomb Attack Arrive in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Three American people, who
were injured in Friday's Nairobi bomb blast, arrived in Pretoria
Saturday morning after being evacuated by the South African Air
Force.
</P>
<P>
The three, one woman and two men, were loaded into waiting
ambulances on their arrival on Boeing 707 just after 8.40 a.m.,
senior military surgeon Dawie Roux said.
</P>
<P>
The woman was cut in the face, bruised and had a broken bone
in her left hand. She was taken from the aircraft on a stretcher.
The two men, one accompanied by his wife, walked to the
ambulances. Both had sustained head injures, Roux said.
</P>
<P>
Keith Betsch, American Military Attache, told local mass media
that the victims of the Nairobi bomb blast were widely dispersed
in at least four Nairobi hospitals. Many were in state of shock
and trauma and could therefore not be moved.
</P>
<P>
A massive blast on Friday morning damaged the U.S. embassy in
Nairobi, Kenya, killing about 80 people and injured over 2,000
others.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another bomb explosion took place near the American
embassy in Dar es Salaam, the capital of Tanzania. At least four
people were reportedly killed, and many others injured in the
explosion.
</P>
<P>
The South African foreign affairs department said it deplored
the bomb blasts, describing the attacks as "senseless".

<HEADLINE> Iran Against Foreign Military Intervention in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi has voiced Tehran's strong opposition to any foreign
military intervention in its northeastern neighbor Afghanistan,
the official news agency IRNA reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
No country should intervene and waste its potentials and
forces in the devastating civil war in Afghanistan, Kharrazi told
IRNA Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
Instead, all countries, including Afghanistan's neighbors, must
try to persuade the belligerent parties to engage in serious
negotiation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi made the remarks after the Afghan Taliban militia
launched large range of military offensives against its rival the
Northern Alliance headed by Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabani,
who was driven by Taliban from Kabul in September, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Latest reports said Taliban captured Mazar-I Sharif, the main
stronghold of the Northern Alliance on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Some reports from Afghanistan said that the Northern Alliance
accused Pakistan of sending troops to help Taliban in recent
fightings.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister warned that Iran cannot allow
security of this sensitive region to be played with and become a
tool for ambitions of others, urging the regional governments to
play a more constructive role in this respect.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi also noted that ethnic minorities in Afghanistan
instead of targeting one another should work to restore their
rights through political negotiations.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein Allowed Leave From Clinic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein has been given a few
days' leave from the U.S. Mayo Clinic, where he had underwent the
first session of chemotherapy to treat the cancer of his lymphatic
tissue, the semi-official Jordan Times reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed to Crown Prince Hassan, the Regent, on
late Friday evening, King Hussein said he decided to go to
Washington and stay there on his leave, before returning again to
the clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, for more sessions of
treatment in the coming four to five months.
</P>
<P>
"Their (the doctors') decision came as a result of the
tangible progress in my condition, the improvement of the blood
count which as expected went down after the first cycle of
treatment as well as the accelerated progress towards normalcy,"
the king said in his letter.
</P>
<P>
Hussein also told Hassan that he is "pleasantly surprised" to
know that the doctors permitted him to leave the clinic for
Washington before starting a new round of chemotherapy on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He did not elaborate what he will do during his stay in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
The king added that his morale is high but he was advised by
the doctors "to avoid public places to protect against infection
before blood count goes back to normal and before starting the new
cycle of treatment."
</P>
<P>
Hussein, 62, has been hospitalized at the clinic since July 14
for suffering from non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma, which is highly
treatable with chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to receive chemotherapy intravenously once
every 20 days over a period from four to five months.
</P>
<P>
The king underwent surgery to remove cancer from his ureter
and left kidney at the Mayo Clinic in 1992 and has had regular
medical checkups at the clinic since then.
</P>
<P>
In April 1997, he had surgery for an enlarged prostate that was
benign. He had an operation in November 1997 to remove an inflamed
lymph gland that was also found to be benign.
</P>
<P>
Hussein is the longest-reigning ruler in the Middle East. He is
due to celebrate 46 years on the throne on Tuesday. Hassan, his
brother, is the king's legal successor.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Government Defends Privatization Plan of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian government will go
ahead with the sale of the Jordan Telecommunication Company (JTC)
despite of the criticism that the sale only benefits foreigners,
the semi-official Jordan Times reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Quoted in the newspaper, Deputy Prime Minister for Development
Affairs and Minister of Foreign Affairs Jawad Anani said 40
percent of JTC's shares will be sold to "a strategic partner."
</P>
<P>
"It is about state-of-the-art technology, then it can be
bought ...... We do not need anyone to teach us how to do our job
technically," said Anani who is also heading the Higher
Ministerial Committee for Privatization at the prime minister's
office.
</P>
<P>
Anani told the newspaper that two foreign companies have
already submitted their bids to become the strategic partner, who
will be obliged to inject new investment, update its technology,
establish incentive management mechanism and increase the
company's profits by a large margin.
</P>
<P>
The paper also quoted a government timetable as saying that
the British Cable and Wireless Company has submitted a bid worth
320 million U.S. dollars while the United States Southern Bell
Company offered half of that in its own bid.
</P>
<P>
The government has started to evaluate these bids, the
timetable said.
</P>
<P>
Anani made his remarks a week after the JTC's new Chairman of
Board Ali Shukri said that priority should be given to the
Jordanians, especially the JTC's employees, but not to a strategic
partner, in the selling of shares.
</P>
<P>
The partial sale of the JTC, whose asset stands at 1.2 billion
dollars, will make Jordan the first Arab country to allow private
or foreign ownership of its established telecommunication network.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government includes the privatization of the JTC
and other state-own companies as a major component of its reform
program to increase the role of the private sector, reduce its
direct participation in the productive sectors and help combat
poverty and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
However, the privatization plan can not become legal till now
because the parliament has been strongly opposing it. The
parliament said that the country needs extra laws to protect its
people who are easy to be hurt by the privatization plan.

<HEADLINE> Regional Leaders Arrive in Zimbabwe for DRC Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Seven heads of state and
government from southern and eastern Africa are scheduled to hold
an emergency meeting Saturday to discuss the widening rift and
tension between the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and its
neighbors, Uganda and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The leaders arrived in the city of Victoria Falls of Zimbabwe
Friday night to attend the meeting called by Ugandan President
Yoweri Museveni at the second Southern African International
Dialog in Namibia's coastal city of Swakopmund at the end of
July.
</P>
<P>
The summit was initially scheduled to discuss the
reconciliation of differences between DRC and its neighbors,
Uganda and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
But because of the growing discontent with DRC President
Laurent Kabila's leadership, spearheaded by the Tutsi-dominated
opposition, the meeting will also focus on how to persuade
President Kabila to negotiate with the rebels, sources said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Museveni and Kabila, and lately the growing
tension between Kabila and Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu
and other Rwandan leaders, have become a source of worry to
leaders in both east and southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Stability in the Great Lakes region can never be a reality so
long as these tensions exist.
</P>
<P>
The seven leaders to attend the summit are Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe, Ugandan President Museveni, Tanzanian
President Benjamin Mkapa, Zambian President Frederick Chiluba,
Namibian President Sam Nujoma, Rwandan President Bizimungu and
DRC President Kabila.

<HEADLINE> Ranariddh Reaffirms Rejection of Elections Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Deposed first prime minister
Prince Norodom Ranariddh reaffirmed here on Saturday that he and
his party Funcinpec would not accept the results of the elections.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Funcinpec's headquarters, Ranariddh said, "we ask
to revote in some constituencies which have serious election
fraud, and to revive the former formula of seat allocation."
</P>
<P>
Regarding Funcinpec's coalition with the Cambodian People's
Party (CPP), he said it would be decided by Funcinpec's leadership.
</P>
<P>
But Funcinpec would first count the final result after the
investigation and verification on election's fraud. Otherwise
Funcinpec's parliamentarians would not take part in the meeting
of the National Assembly, he added.
</P>
<P>
Funcinpec would ask for the post of National Assembly chairman,
which is now held by CPP President Chea Sim, Ranariddh
continued.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh stressed that the next government must be a
three-party coalition to be made up of CPP, Funcinpec
and SRP.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ranariddh vowed he would not participate in the
government led by Hun Sen, because the Cambodian people would
oppose him to do so, and he himself also has lost confidence in
Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
He believed that Hun Sen could not take any measure to resolve
the problems faced by Cambodia now, such as national security,
corruption and Vietnamese immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Funcinpec and the Sam Rainsy Party (SRP), claiming election
fraud, now unite to oppose the common rival -- the CPP, and have
vowed not to form any coalition government with the it unless
there is a new election in the disputed areas.
</P>
<P>
But most analysts here expect Funcinpec to contest the results
first and then agree to a coalition in return for concessions.

<HEADLINE> Embankment Breach Widens Because of Mechanical Mishaps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JIUJIANG, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The breach on the defence
embankment in the city of Jiujiang, in east China's Jiangxi
Province, somewhat expanded owing to mechanical mishaps resultant
from bigger water flows.
</P>
<P>
A barge called in urgently to pitch in the effort to plug up
the breach went out of control because of a sudden power cut. It
then was swept down to a sunk boat loaded with stone on the right
side of the breach, making the stones at and around the boat's
bottom unfastened and washed away by swift rapids, which then
widened the breach from 40 meters to 60 meters and resulted in
significantly larger water flows.
</P>
<P>
The breach occured at around 4:00 Friday afternoon as floods
kept surging.
</P>
<P>
As cranes cannot go into operation, the iron containers filled
with rocks cannot be thrown in to stop the breach.
</P>
<P>
Right now, efforts are being intensified to tow away the barge
and cast in more rocks and stones. Policemen are also working hard
to drive in piles to reinforce the anti-flood embankment.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the delayed supply of rocks and stones is
hindering the refitting of the dyke. And an urgent order has been
issued to transport in 20 freight trucks of rocks and stone from
Nanchang, the Provincial capital.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Opposition Demands Peace Treaty With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- A coalition of Jordan's opposition
parties has blamed last month's water pollution in west Amman on
Israel and called for the government to terminate the peace treaty
it signed with Israel in 1994, according to a statement obtained
by Xinhua here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The temporarily-organized coalition, which includes the most
influential opposition party, the Islamic Action Front, said in
the statement that the polluted water, that has left many people
hospitalized for diarrhea and nausea-related diseases and caused
panic all over the capital since July 5, came from Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The polluted water coming from the Lake Tiberias (in Israel)
is a result of the peace treaty. Therefore, the coalition urges
all local powers to unify their efforts to abrogate the treaty,"
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Jordan reached a peace agreement in 1994, under
which Jordan was allowed to store 50 million cubic meters of water
in the Lake Tiberias each winter and then reclaim it in summer.
</P>
<P>
In early July, the residents in west Amman began to complain
of discolored and foul-smelling tap water. Recent investigations
of the Jordanian Royal Scientific Society said that there was a
high concentration of algae in the water coming from the Lake
Tiberias and the Yarmouk River, which are the major water
sources for Amman.
</P>
<P>
The water treatment plant for the capital failed to treat the
water in time, thus causing the pollution.
</P>
<P>
The government has not drawn its own conclusion of the issue
yet. A special commission is still working to specify the
pollution source and find the persons responsible for the issue.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian-Israel peace treaty used to be criticized by the
House of Representatives, where the opposition parties share a
number of seats, while the government is determined to carry it
out and insists on normalization of ties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is one of the two Arab countries to sign peace treaty
with Israel and sticks to normalization of ties with the Jewish
state. The other is Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Government in Crisis Over Water Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Recent water scandal has pushed
the Jordanian government into a deep crisis, as King Hussein
lashed it for negligence and the parliament as well as the
opposition parties demanded its resignation.
</P>
<P>
The king now hospitalized in the United States, in a letter to
Crown Prince Hassan, the Regent on late Friday evening criticized
the government as "being lax in carrying out its duties and
responsibilities," especially on the recent water pollution issue.
</P>
<P>
Panic hit Amman on July 5, as many citizens, especially those
in the western part of the city, found discolored water coming out
of taps with a strange smell and taste. The situation was brought
to control a week later.
</P>
<P>
The king blamed the government for not being able to produce a
reasonable explanation and specify the pollution source yet.
</P>
<P>
This makes it imperative to "take proper action against any
mistake or act of negligence," said the king, who is the supreme
leader of the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
He added that he hoped a special commission established earlier
this week will find the pollution source and spotting the persons
responsible for this incident that have left many people
hospitalized for diarrhea and nausea-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Agricultural and Water Committee under
the Lower House of Parliament, submitted a report to the house
speaker, demanding the resignation and trial of Minister of Water
and Mineral Resources Munther Haddadin and the Jordan Water
Authority's Secretary-General Munther Khleifat for their role in
"causing the problem."
</P>
<P>
The committee in its investigation report released on Tuesday
said the source of polluted water was from the Tiberias Lake and
the Yarmouk River bordering Israel, adding diplomatic color to the
issue.
</P>
<P>
A coalition of Jordanian opposition parties, in a statement
obtained by Xinhua here Saturday, even urged the whole government
to resign over the scandal. The issue was called as "the month-old
water crisis that has caused nationwide panic" in the statement.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Jordan Times Saturday quoted Prime Minister
Abdul-Salam Majali as saying in Amman that any person found to be
responsible for the incident will be punished.
</P>
<P>
Majali arrived in Amman later Friday after meeting the king in
the U.S.. He said that he did not discuss with the king the
demanded resignation of his government.
</P>
<P>
Majali said "The things have not developed to that extent (of
resignation) and unfortunately, every now and then, we find some
people who wish or desire the resignation of the government."
</P>
<P>
The current government was appointed by the king in March,
1997 and later underwent a small reshuffle. But many said the
government's overall performance are unsatisfactory.

<HEADLINE> Another 6 Found Dead in Nairobi Bomb Blast Scene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Another six bodies of people
were found overnight from the rubbles of the bomb blast rocking
downtown Nairobi Friday, putting the confirmed death toll to
nearly 90, the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) said.
</P>
<P>
The death toll for sure will exceed 100, ICRC information
officer Nina Golbe told Xinhua by phone Saturday morning. The
bomb blew up near the U.S. Embassy in a very busy commercial
area.
</P>
<P>
She said until 11:00 p.m. Friday, more than 1,100 people had
been dropped to hospitals, only 75 of them were discharged
afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of rescues workers, making shifts, worked through the
whole night on the rubbles but so far as the ICRC knows, only
seven people were found, six of them already dead, Golbe said.
</P>
<P>
The seventh, a Kenyan man, was found to be still alive but
serious injured when he was pulled out of the debris.
</P>
<P>
Eight Americans, including two women and one child, were
killed by the bombing and another 15 wounded with one still
missing, U.S. embassy spokesman Chris Scharf told Xinhua Friday
evening.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell was seen to be taken out
into an ambulance minutes after the blast. She was believed to
be slightly injured but now the U.S. Embassy said she is OK and
is presiding over a meeting.
</P>
<P>
U.S. medical and forensic experts were due in the Kenyan
capital on Saturday as Washington launched an urgent
investigation into deadly car bomb attacks on two of its east
African embassies. Another one occurred in Tanzanian capital Dar
es Salaam at about 10:45 a.m. Friday, some ten minutes after the
Nairobi blast.
</P>
<P>
Ufundi Co-op House -- a five-story office block between the
U.S. embassy and the 22-story Co-operative Bank House -- was
turned into a pile of debris.
</P>
<P>
The whole rear wall of the U.S. embassy was gone, leaving five
rows of smoke-blackened empty rooms staring at the leaden sky.
</P>
<P>
At least two big buses full of passengers were seriously
damaged as they passed the building when the bomb blew up, more
than 20 passengers have been confirmed dead.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of vehicles were also damaged on the scene, which is a
very busy commercial area of the Kenyan capital.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Trade Minister Joseph Kamotho have sustained slight
injuries. The minister and the U.S. ambassador met in Kamotho's
office in the raided building half an hour before the blast.
</P>
<P>
The rescue work was expected to last several days.
</P>
<P>
"The rescue is ongoing. We are doing everything possible to
help those wounded and... to make sure everyone moved out of the
ruins," said the U.S. embassy spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi late Friday inspected the
blast scene and visited victims at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
He said he was deeply shocked and condemned the attack, vowing
to try best "to bring the perpetrators of the heinous crime to
book."
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan police said Friday evening that it highly suspects
that the bomb blast is a terrorism attack aimed at the Americans.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the bomb explosion near the U.S. embassy
in Dar es Salaam killed at least six people.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Two different boat
accidents in Lake Victoria and Lake Manyara in Tanzania have
killed at least 21 people, media reports said.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen passengers got drowned Friday in Lake Victoria after
their boat capsized in the Serengeti District, said the Mwanza
Regional Police Commander Eliah Kihengu.
</P>
<P>
He told local press Friday that the boat sank as it was
ferrying passengers to board MV Butiama which was heading for
Nyamilembe from Mwanza.

<P>
Passengers in the area usually travel by boats to board the
ship which anchors at a distance from the lake port.
</P>
<P>
Kihengu said the boat had about 30 passengers on board and
that it capsized after colliding with the ship. Six people were
rescued by nearby people who rushed to the scene.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports from the northern region of Arusha
indicated that Friday night three fishermen were feared to get

JERUSALEM, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
President (PNA) Yasser Arafat has condemned the bombing attacks on
the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, while Israel has decided
to send teams to help rescue works, Israel Radio reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The PNA condemned "very strongly and clearly the terrorism

<HEADLINE> Yangtze Water Level Fluctuating As Smaller Dykes Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Water level of the Yangtze River
has been fluctuating and is still below the danger line of 45
meters at the Shashi Measuring Point, set for a flood diversion in
Gong'an County, in central China's Hubei Province, owing to
unexpected breaches of two smaller dykes downstream this morning.
</P>
<P>
Latest reports show that the water level at the Zhicheng
Measuring Point plummeted by a dozen cm as two smaller auxiliary
dykes breached 50 km east of Gong'an County where the Jingjiang
Flood Diversion Zone is located.
</P>
<P>
Last night, a local expert forecast that the water level will
possibly top the 45 m-level, saying if the level reaches that high
and even poises to climb further, the diversion scheme has to be
carried out by blasting part of Yangtze embankments and releasing
floodwater through the North Flood Gate.
</P>
<P>
Local people still prepare themselves for the proposed
diversion scheme by efforts to evacuate the diversion zones from
Thursady and conduct exercises for diversion and check-up
equipment at the North Flood Gate nearby the Yangtze Embankments.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Boosts Trade With Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has made efforts to boost
trade with Malaysia in recent years and has made progress to some
extent.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has established a Committee for Implementation of
Bilateral Trade of Myanmar and Malaysia and held the first
coordination meeting of the committee here Friday, the official
paper The New Light of Myanmar reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar Minister for Commerce Major-General Kyaw Than said at
the meeting that the aim of the meeting was to promote trade and
further strengthen goodwill ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar and Malaysia signed in March an agreement on avoidance
of double taxation and prevention of income tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
Agreements were also signed in June with Malaysia's Petronas
Company to buy crude oil and diesel oil from Malaysia with 50
percent of the payment for the goods in cash and the other 50
percent with Myanmar products.
</P>
<P>
The two countries' trade grew from 64.8 million U.S. dollars in
the 1992-93 fiscal year to 192 million dollars in fiscal 1996-97
ending in March, traditionally favoring Malaysia in the balance of
trade, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The figures show that Malaysia brought in a capital of 587
million dollars in 25 permitted projects at the end of 1997,
standing as the fourth largest foreign investor in Myanmar after
Britain, Singapore and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar and Malaysia established diplomatic relations in early
1958. The exchange of visits between their leaders in the recent
two years has significantly contributed to the further development
of their ties and cooperation.

<HEADLINE> California Jury Awards $760 Million to Ex-Lockheed Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, August 7 (Xinhua) -- A California jury has awarded
760.6 million U.S. dollar in punitive damages to 38 former Lockheed
Corp. employees who claimed they were harmed by toxic chemicals while
building the stealth fighter for the company, a lawyer for the
defendants said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Superior Court lawsuit was filed by former employees who worked
on the radar-evading jet during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, plaintiff
lawyer Thomas Girardi said in a statement, claiming the workers were
never advised of the danger posed by the chemicals.
</P>
<P>
In the lawsuits, the workers said that they suffered health
problems ranging from headaches and skin rashes to terminal cancers as
a result of exposure to various chemicals used in building the stealth
fighter.
</P>
<P>
The verdict against five chemical manufacturers including Exxon
Corp., Unocal Corp., Ashland Inc., Shell Oil Co. and DuPont, but not
against Lockheed, was reached Thursday and announced Friday. It
follows a compensatory damages verdict last week in which the workers
were awarded 25.4 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The latest lawsuit is among several filed by Ex-Lockheed workers
and residents who lived near Lockheed's secret plant which, according
to Associated Press, produced top secret airplanes, including the
stealth fighter and U-2 spy plane.
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for both Unocal Corp. and Exxon Corp. said their
companies would appeal.

<HEADLINE> Hi-Tech Companies Offered Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Science and
Technology will work together with other relevant departments to
spell out potential pitfalls of entering stock markets to help
hi-tech medium and small-sized firms raise capital, today's "China
Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The move will help hi-tech companies that would otherwise be
unable to raise the money needed to expand without offering stock,
Minister Xu Guanhua said at the start of a national conference
held yesterday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which ends tomorrow, was held to mark the 10th
anniversary of the Torch Programme -- a national plan implemented
with the State Council's approval to propel regional economic
growth through developing hi-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has decided to allocate special funds to fuel
the development of medium- and small-sized firms, which contribute
two-third of the total output generated by the country's
industrial companies. Xu said.
</P>
<P>
But a lack of start-up capitals is hindering China's hi-tech
development, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the State will start hi-tech business incubators
in universities to exploit their brain power.

<HEADLINE> Irrigated Cropland Increases in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yangon, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The irrigated cropland amounted to
1.94 million hectares in the 1997-98 fiscal year which ended in
March, 87,010 hectares more than the previous year, according to
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The increase was due to the expanded irrigated area for summer
paddy cultivation, said a latest annual report on agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, which is the mainstay of Myanmar's economy
traditionally accounting for 35 to 40 percent of the gross
domestic product (GDP) and 35 percent of the export, grew by 2.9
percent in its output value in the 1997-98 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
In the year, a total of eight irrigation facilities were built
in the country, irrigating 184,072 hectares of farmland.
</P>
<P>
The completed irrigation facilities in the whole country added
up to 90 since late 1988, of which 22 are in central Mandalay
division where arid zones lie.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to increased irrigation facilities, the production of
paddy, one of the four pillar crops of Myanmar, went up to 17.3
million tons in 1997-98.

<HEADLINE> Enhanced Efforts Continued to Plug Up Breach in Jiujiang Dykes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JIUJIANG, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The 40-meter breach on the
defence embankment in the city of Jiujiang, in east Jiangxi
Province, is expected to be plugged up in around 24 hours if all
essential materials are supplied without fail.
</P>
<P>
Eight boats have been sunk into the breach to stop leaking
water and floods at both the upper and lower reaches have been
largely brought under control, but water is continuing to bubble
out from the hull of the boats, according to Yang Guangxu, head of
a specialists' team of the State Flood Control and Drought Relief
Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
At about 1:10 pm Friday, a water-sodden point was found at the
defence dyke about five km from the city proper. The point was
enlarged into a two-feet leakage in less than 20 minutes, and at
2:00 pm, the embankments partially collapsed. At around 4:00 pm, a
breach of 45 meters was shaped and two-meter deep water began to
inundate the western parts of the city.
</P>
<P>
Right now, a 90-m-long protective shelter is being erected
right outside the breached dyke and a 80-m-long cofferdam built
inside the dyke, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
At least 25,000 cubic meters of crushed rocks and stone and
other filling materials are required to fill in a six-m section
between the protective shelter and the cofferdam to reinforce the
dyke and stop water flow.
</P>
<P>
Experts are considering throwing filled bags into pre-made
steel frames or setting up scaffolds of steel pipes to block
intruding water.
</P>
<P>
The main difficulty right now lies in the lack of stones and
other filling materials, as there are less than 10,000 tons of
crushed stone available. At least three boats carrying coals and
sand have arrived at the spot, with more expected to rush in.
</P>
<P>
So far stone, soybean, rice, and coal have been used, among
other things, to fill in bags used to block leaking water.
</P>
<P>
The local Flood Control Headquarters has urged residents to
evacuate the area. More than 30,000 civilians and soliders, many
of whom have not eaten for a whole day, are working hard shoulder
by shoulder to refit the dyke.
</P>
<P>
Jiujiang City, along the southern bank of the middle reaches of
the Yangtze River, lies in the northern part of Jiangxi
Province. The city proper covers a 42 sq km area with a population
of some 500,000.
</P>
<P>
Jiujiang is dotted with lakes and rivers, of which the most
well-known is the Poyang Lake, the country's largest freshwater
lake. For weeks, the 3,976-sq-km lake has maintained record
flooding water levels.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Import Thai Rice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia plans to buy 500,000
tons of rice from Thailand for about 6 billion baht (150 million
U.S. dollars), The Bangkok Post said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Supachai Panitchpakdi, Thailand's deputy prime minister and
commerce minister, signed a memorandum with Ahmed Musih Saefuddin,
Indonesia's state minister for food and horticulture, here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the memorandum, 400,000 tons of rice will be bought on
three years' credit while cash will be paid for the rest.
</P>
<P>
The rice is for delivery between September and January at
280-282 dollars per ton, the newspaper quoted sources familiar
with the deal as saying.
</P>
<P>
The credit interest rate will be three percentage points above
the London Interbank Offered Rate. The Export-Import Bank of
Thailand will discuss details with Indonesian officials later.
</P>
<P>
The central bank of Indonesia will guarantee letters of credit
from Indonesian banks acceptable to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said he was confident Indonesia would be able to pay
for the rice as Jakarta had obtained assistance from the
International Monetary Fund and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian state minister said the rice would be sold at
low prices to help consumers as the rupiah's plunge against the
U.S. dollar had made consumer products very expensive. The problem
has worsened when drought slashed domestic production of rice in
the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Two major Chinese firms will
start to issue a total of 38.5 million US dollars worth corporate
bonds beginning today and Monday, according to China Daily today.
</P>
<P>
Real estate firm Beijing Huayuan Property Co. will offer 120
million yuan (about 14.5 million US dollars) worth of three-year
bonds from now through September 6. The firm will then apply for
listing on one of China's stock exchanges in Shanghai or Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Huayuan is a joint-venture in property development jointly
started in late 1994 with Jianshi Development Co, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of China Resources Beijing Ltd, a Hong Kong-listed
red-chip firm.

<P>
Money from the bond issue will be used in a five-billion yuan
(602.4 million US Dollars) property renovation project in Beijing.

Meanwhile, Dongfeng Motor Corp., a joint venture with French
auto maker PSA Peugeot Citron in central Hubei Province, will
issue 200 million yuan (about 24 million US dollars) worth of

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Trade Development
Council (TDC) said that at least two of the six companies that
toured State-owned enterprises in Shandong last month have started
active negotiations to form joint venture.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong-based Atlas Magnetics Manufacturing Ltd is currently
negotiating with Qingdao Micro-motor Factory and Qingdao Connector
Factory to thrash out deals on setting up a joint venture for the
production of ferrite products and magnetic connectors, today's
China Daily reported, quoting Ricky Cheung, president of Atlas
Magnetics Manufacturing Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Cheung said that if Atlas cooperates with the Shandong SOEs, it
can cut 10 percent from depreciation costs of certain product
lines.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong-based Trigo Enterprises Ltd, which is considering
setting up joint ventures with SOEs on the bus production in
Shandong, has approached the Chinese National Heavy Vehicle Corp
and the Qingdao City Special Vehicle Manufacturing Corp and the
Qingdao-Pacific Passenger Vehicle Co. Ltd, Johnny Wan, manager of
the TDC said.
</P>
<P>
If deals are struck, agreements to be signed will be worth at
least 249 million yuan (about 30 million US dollars), he said.

Recently, investment policies in China have been relaxed,
making it easier for companies to take part in joint ventures,

<HEADLINE> Thai Banks to Refinance Clients of Property Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Customers of 164 housing and
condominium development projects in Thailand, which have been
unable to transfer completed units after their financiers were
shut down, can start applying for refinancing from two state banks
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Nation newspaper said Saturday that Government Housing Bank
and Government Savings Bank have agreed to spend 19.7 billion baht
(492.5 million U.S. dollars) to bail out those customers.
</P>
<P>
House buyers are required to contact the National Housing
Authority, the middleman of the program, which will forward their
applications to the two banks.
</P>
<P>
The program has been initiated by the government to help
property buyers who have been affected by last year's closure of
56 finance companies.
</P>
<P>
Normally, property developers pledge land plots with financial
institutions for an amount of money to cover construction costs.
After the 56 companies were shut down, the projects-in-progress
ran into a liquidity crunch and land ownership could not be
transferred to buyers.
</P>
<P>
The two banks agreed to lend up to 70 percent of the appraised
value of properties which are more than 90 percent complete. For
projects that are more than 50 percent complete, the banks will
lend 70 percent of the appraised land value and 80 percent of
construction costs.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Thailand's property sector could see recovery
within the next three to five years, after land ownership limits
and restrictions are eased for foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The government is in the process of amending a law to allow
foreigners to lease properties for up to 100 years, instead of the
current limit of 30 years.

<HEADLINE> China's First Elevated Rail To Be Built In Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has already received
approval from the State Council to build China's first elevated
rail, which is expected to open in July 2000, according to today's
"China Daily."
</P>
<P>
The billion-dollar, 25-kilometer-long rail starts at Caohejing
in Xuhui District and ends at Jiangwan Town in Hongkou District
with 19 stops on the way.
</P>
<P>
A short 3.5-km stretch of the proposed rail will be built at
ground level, said Tan Qikun, deputy director of the Shanghai
Construction Commission.
</P>
<P>
The rail will have connections with subways, trains, and buses
at Caohejing, Shanghai Stadium, Hongqiao Station, the Shanghai
Railway Sation, and at Baoshan, Tan said.
</P>
<P>
The first phase is expected to cost about 8.6 billion yuan
(1.03 billion US dollars) with each kilometer of rail costing 344
million yuan (41 million US dollars), Tan said.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has set up a company with a registered capital of 2.7
billion yuan (325 million US dollars) to oversee the project. The
company has invested about three billion yuan (362 million US
dollars) in the project and plans to borrow 190 million US dollars
in loans from foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
The stretch of tracks has already been dismantled, 430,000
square meters of housing have been demolished and the 5,400
families and 500 businesses located near the tracks have been
relocated. The city will finish laying tracks and decorating
stations by next June.
</P>
<P>
Trains, driving at a speed of 35 kilometers per hour and
arriving every 5.5 minutes, will carry 730,000 passengers daily.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Coffee Exports Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Brazil, the biggest
producer and exporter of coffee in the world, has seen coffee
sales abroad reduced by 27 percent during the first six months of
1998.
</P>
<P>
Data released by the Brazilian Association of Coffee Exporters
showed that from January to June, coffee exports amounted to 5.6
million 60-kilogram bags, with a total income of 1.020 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The main buyers of Brazilian coffee are the United States and
Germany. The U.S. imported 728,300 bags and Germany bought 669,900
bags.
</P>
<P>
Jorge Esteve, president of the association, said the reduction
in exports was caused by the drop in supply. The previous harvest
produced only 22.5 million bags, the least of this decade. But the
situation of the next six months will improve and coffee sales
will increase from 10 to 11 million bags.
</P>
<P>
Government sources said the coffee output will surpass 30
million bags this year, with a growth of more than 30 percent over
last year.
</P>
<P>
Brazil exports about 15 million bags of coffee every year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's foreign reserves fell
by 700 million U.S. dollars to 26.8 billion dollars as of July 31
from the previous week due to the central bank's settlement of
forward contract obligations.

448.1 billion baht (11.2 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The statement said reserve money rose on cash demand by the
public, but deposits of financial institutions at the central bank
declined as they needed to make their provisional reserves for the
period between July 23 and August 7.
</P>
<P>
As of July 31, the central bank's net obligations to the
government amounted to 13.1 billion baht (327.5 million dollars),

The statement said the domestic liquidity was tight in the
beginning of the week to July 31 but eased later.
</P>
<P>
The overnight repurchase rate dropped from a range of 10
percent to 11.13 percent per year on July 24 to a range of 8.75
percent to 11.375 percent on July 31.

<TEXT>
<P>
JIUJIANG, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Eight boats have been sunk into
a 40-meter breach of the defence embankment in the city of
Jiujiang, in east China's Jiangxi Province, but the flooding
situation has not yet been brought under control.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of people are throwing bags filled with coal
into pre-made steel frames to plug up water sneaking out into the
city through gaps between the sunken boats.
</P>
<P>
However, the situation has not improved substantially as some
old gaps continue to gush out water and new gaps appeared between
the boats, and there are cracks in hulls of some boats, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
At about 12:30 Friday, a water-sodden point was found at the
city defence dyke. The point was enlarged into a two feet leakage
in less than an hour and, at 4:00 pm, the embankments partially
collapsed. Then, the two-meter deep water began to inundate the
western parts of the city through a 40-meter breach.
</P>
<P>
Stone, soybean, rice, and coal have been used, among other
things, to fill in bags used to block leaking water.
</P>
<P>
The local Flood Control Headquarters has urged residents to
evacuate the area.
</P>
<P>
Jiujiang City, along the southern bank of the middle reaches of
the Yangtze River, lies in the northern part of Jiangxi
Province. The city proper covers a 42 sq km area with a population
of some 500,000.
</P>
<P>
Jiujiang is dotted with lakes and rivers, of which the most
well-known is the Poyang Lake, the country's largest freshwater
lake. For weeks, the 3,976-sq-km lake has maintained record
flooding water levels.

transferred to IBRA and insolvency declarations have been made in
four of the cases," the government was quoted as saying in a
letter to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Friday as part
of a series of regular updates on the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has pledged a 43 billion U.S. dollar bailout package to
help Indonesia deal with its economic crisis. As part of the
government's sweeping economic reforms that focused on banking
restructuring, six ailing banks were taken over by IBRA in April.
</P>
<P>
They include Bank Danamon, Bank BDNI, Bank Umum Nasional, Bank
Tiara Asia, Bank Modern and Bank PDFCI.
</P>
<P>
However, the government declined to reveal the names of the
four banks declared insolvent.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, demands have mounted that the
government take legal action against those responsible for the
insolvencies, including both bankers and owners.
</P>
<P>
The letter to the IMF also said the government expected the
economy to contract by 15 percent this year, but was optimistic
that the country will record a positive growth in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The government was working toward achieving single-digit
inflation within no more than two years, the letter said.
</P>
<P>
Year-end inflation is forecast to reach 80 percent this year.
An inflation of almost 60 percent was recorded between January and
July this year.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Wood Industries Face Shortage of Logs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian wood-processing
industries are facing a severe shortage of logs, the local press
Saturday quoted the Indonesian Forestry Society (MPI) as saying.
</P>
<P>
The country's processing capacities have exceeded log output,
said MPI chairman Sudrajat.
</P>
<P>
The supply shortage is partly due to a lack of coordination
among related government agencies such as the Ministry of Forestry
and Plantations, the Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) and the
Ministry of Industry and Trade.
</P>
<P>
"BKPM issued permits to develop wood-processing industries
without calculating the log supply with the Ministry of Forestry
and Plantations," Sudrajat said.
</P>
<P>
Local wood-processing businesses would need about 35 million to
36 million cubic meters a year while the supply of logs would only
total 26 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
"Wood-processing industries are only operating at 30 percent to
40 percent of their production capacity due to the scarcity of
logs," he added.

<HEADLINE> PFA Chief: Stars Deserve Their Payment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Professional
Footballers'Association has defended its members after a report
revealed the spiralling wages enjoyed by Premier League stars.
</P>
<P>
Top flight salaries were criticised in the 1998 Deloitte &AMP;
Touche Annual Review of Football Finance when the report said
money was bypassing the lower leagues and going straight into
players' pockets.
</P>
<P>
But PFA deputy chief executive Brendon Batson claimed: "It is
only right that the reason for the success should benefit from it."
</P>
<P>
The former Arsenal and West Brom star believes that clubs have
to constantly improve salaries to achieve that success.
</P>
<P>
"It has always been the case in a labour intensive industry
that the biggest thing for clubs would be the players' wages and
nothing has changed in that respect," Batson said.
</P>
<P>
"The increase in wages has been a trend over the last few years.
</P>
<P>
"It has always been a concern with the formation of the Premier
League that clubs in the lower divisions would suffer because the
monies are being pooled at the top end.
</P>
<P>
"It is like any employer who is looking at his wage bill. It's
about investment. The reason why clubs are investing heavily in
their players is because they are looking at what they can
generate at the end.
</P>
<P>
"It is not surprising to see that the four top clubs in the
Premier League have the highest wage bill because they can see
that is linked to success.
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that most clubs now in the Premier League
regard success as retaining their status as much as chasing
silverware," he said.

OTTAWA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Top-ranked American Pete Sampras
battled to the quarter-finals at the du Maurier Open tennis event
in Toronto on Friday, beating Germany's Tommy Hass 7-5, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
In the first set, Sampras made a lot of errors against Hass,
the 41th in the world.
</P>
<P>
But Sampras, who appeared tied and sluggish, went on to take
control of the match with an early break in the second set.
</P>
<P>
"It's just a few points that cost me the first set," said the
20-year-old Hass.
</P>
<P>
"In the second he had the momentum going, and it's tough to
come back against an opponent like Pete," Hass said.
</P>
<P>
Sampras is to play eighth-seeded compatriot Andre Agassi in the
quarter-final match later Friday night.
</P>
<P>

NEW YORK, August 7 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks extended a
modest rebound from Tuesday's selloff, but failed in a sharper
rally today as Japan's new leader did not offer measures to revive
the nation's sticky economy.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average finished just 20.34 points
higher at 8,598.02 after retreating from a midday gain of 132

<P>
Technology shares led the Nasdaq market to a second day of big

</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 0.18 to 1,089.45, and the Nasdaq
composite index rose 17.26 to 1,846.77.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government Friday
resumed talks with the rebel National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) after two months of suspension.
</P>
<P>
The talks, attended by U.N. special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi,
discussed some unsettled issues for the 1994 Lusaka peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan peace process was thrown into crisis after the
sudden death of former U.N. Angolan representative Alioune Beye
on June 26.
</P>
<P>
UNITA delegation chairman Isalas Samakuva suggested to
postpone the date for the re-establishment of governmental
administrations in the four towns in central Angola.
</P>
<P>
The towns are Bailundo, Andulo, Mungo and Nharea.
</P>
<P>
Samakuva said that the suggestion might be the only result, if
any, of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Higino Carneiro, the deputy chairman of the government
delegation said after the talks that he could not guarantee that
the country is at present away from war.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the hope of the peace process in Angola would
have to be put on the shoulders of the newly-named U.N.
representative to Angola, Issa Diallo.

NEW YORK, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar rose nearly 2
yen Friday after traders dumped the Japanese currency at the
disappointing speech of Japan's new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Investors were waiting for new programs from the new government
to revive the economy, but they heard no new measures from Keizo
Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 146.13
Japanese yen, up from 144.32 late Thursday. The U.S. currency also

</P>
<P>
In Mexico City in late trading, the dollar was worth 9.064

</P>
<P>
The Mexican peso fell to a record low against the dollar partly
because of pressure from the falling yen.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bomb Rocks Peace in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 7 (Xinhua) -- An explosion in the United
States embassy in the capital Friday has so far killed seven
people and injured 58 others, breaking the peace and tranquility
Tanzania has enjoyed for decades.
</P>
<P>
As the death toll is still rising, the police have tightened
security and started in-depth investigation into the blast,
caused by a bomb planted on an oil tanker which was entering the
gate of the embassy at around 10:45 a.m. (07:45GMT)
</P>
<P>
So far, nobody has claimed responsibility for the act and the
police have not arrested any one.
</P>
<P>
The explosion, which could be heard miles away, shattered the
office building in the embassy as well as structures in the
vicinity. "It was like an earthquake," a resident living close to
the embassy said.
</P>
<P>
The bomb killed several people instantly, throwing limbs in
all directions. About 20 meters from the gate, a bloody body
without head was seen in the grass. Flying glass also hurt people
in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
More than 22 cars and three motorcycles parked outside the
main building of the embassy were seen wrecked in flames.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference in the evening, Commissioner of Police
Wilson Mwansasu said that the U.S. ambassador was safe and sound
because he was not in the office when the explosion took place.
</P>
<P>
But Mwansasu did not say if there were any casualties of
Americans in the U.S. embassy.
</P>
<P>
Mwansasu said that heads of defense and security organs have
formed a five-man task force which was led by Director of
Criminal Investigation Adadi Rajabu.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner has appealed to citizens to provide clues and
asked them to be calm and continue with their work as usual. "The
security situation in Dar es Salaam is under control," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The government has yet to make any statement on the incident,
the first of its kind since the country became independent in
1961.
</P>
<P>
President Benjamin Mkapa is at a meeting in Zimbabwe
discussing the the Democratic Congo conflict with leaders of
other African countries, while Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye is
attending the budget session of the National Assembly in the
central city of Dodoma.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ambassadors were summoned by the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and International Cooperation for an urgent meeting
Friday afternoon. Spokesman for the ministry Simeon Ileta
declined to comment on the bombing. "We are going to tell you
when we are ready," he said.
</P>
<P>
A foreign ministry official said a statement is expected to
come out on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
A similar incident occurred almost at the same time in the
Kenyan capital of Nairobi, leaving at least 70 people dead and
more than 1,000 others injured.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has condemned the two bombings,
saying these terrorist attacks are "abhorrent" and "inhuman."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. Air Force is sending at least two military
aircraft with a surgical team and medical evacuation personnel to
Tanzania and Kenya following the bombings.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, who is now
in Portugal for a visit, said the incidents are heartless and
constitute indiscriminate terrorism against innocent civilians.
He extended deep condolences to the families and governments
concerned.

<HEADLINE> Consequences of Iraqi Non-Cooperation Not Discussed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.N. Security
Council source said Friday that the Council did not discuss the
consequences of Iraq's decision to suspend cooperation with U.N.
arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's suspension of cooperation was a major topic at the
Council's informal consultations on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq early this year was warned of the "severe consequences" if
it violates the Memorandum of Understanding it signed with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan in February which defused a crisis
relating to arms inspection in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's decision to suspend cooperation only "contravenes" the
accord while it has not yet led to any action, and in that sense
this cannot be clearly defined as violation or breach of
international law, the source said.
</P>
<P>
"That was the perception of the Council", he said, adding that
in choosing the proper word to describe the Iraqi decision, the
Council had found the differencies between "violation" and
"contravention".
</P>
<P>
What the source said is in line with the spirits of the
statements made by the Council President and the Secretary-General
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
While rejecting Iraq's announcement as "totally unacceptable",
Council President Danio Turk of Slovania said that the move was
taken after a period of improved cooperation and some tangible
progress and the Council intended to respond favorably to future
progress made in the disarmament progress.
</P>
<P>
The Council called for an early resumption of dialogue between
the U.N. Special Commission for disarmament in Iraq, or UNSCOM,
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said his judgement is that the
Iraqi position on the matter "is not a closed one".
</P>
<P>
"Rather than allowing this situation to deteriorate into a
crisis, the Security Council should seek to engage with the Iraqi
authorities in order to resolve the problem."
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the council make a comprehensive review of
the entire issue by involving a more direct dialogue with Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Produces More Tea to Meet Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian has enough tea
output at present to meet the local demand and to export its
surplus abroad, a report said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Tesegaye Berhane, General Manager of the
Coffee and Tea Authority of Ethiopia, as saying a total of 3,800
tons of tea was produced during the just ended 1997/98 fiscal
year (ending July 7) out of which 181 tons was supplied to the
foreign market.
</P>
<P>
The general manager recalled that the tea production could not
meet the local demand just a few years ago, saying that Ethiopian
tea is fast emerging competitive in European and other foreign
markets since they are of a high quality standard.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, out of the six-million hectares of land in
the country suitable for tea production, only 2,104 hectares have
so far been exploited.

<HEADLINE> Annan Satisfied with Cambodian Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan is satisfied with the recent elections in Cambodia, his
spokesman said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the spokesman said: "The
Secretary-General is pleased that elections to the National
Assembly in Cambodia were held on schedule on 26 July."
</P>
<P>
Noting with satisfaction that the polling process was primarily
peaceful and orderly, Annan congratulates the Cambodian people on
the overwhelming turnout of voters, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General hopes that all political parties will
resolve outstanding problems through dialogue and due process. The
objective should be the formation of a government that fully
reflects the wish of the Cambodian people for reconciliation,
pluralism and development," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The elections were conducted under international observation.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary results announced on Wednesday, the
ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) led by the incumbent
co-premier Hun Sen won over 2.03 million votes, followed by
Funcinpec of Prince Norodom Ranariddh with 1.55 million votes, and
the opposition Sam Rainsy Party ((SRP) with 690,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
The CPP, failing to gain the required two-third majority in the
122 seat National Assembly, has to form a coalition with Funcinpec
or SRP or both.
</P>
<P>
The new National Assembly is expected to convene on September
24 before the formation of the government in early October.

<HEADLINE> Judiciary Committee's Democrats Select Ethics Lawyer for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Democrats of the House of
Representatives have chosen a former ethics committee lawyer to
head any inquiry into U.S. President Bill Clinton's conduct should
special prosecutor Kenneth Starr send Congress a report on his
obstruction-of-justice investigation.
</P>
<P>
Ranking Democrat John Conyers of Michigan has hired veteran
Washington lawyer Abbe Lowell, former outside counsel to the
Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, The Associated Press
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lowell's firm, Brand Lowell &AMP; Ryan, specializes in government
ethics law.
</P>
<P>
Lowell fills the fourth and final position allotted committee
Democrats out of the 18 new staff jobs Republican leaders earlier
this year authorized for the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
Democrats have also hired investigative counsels Kevin Simpson,
a 10-year veteran of the Justice Department and Steve Reich, a
former federal public defender in Greenbelt, Maryland. Also
joining the team is press secretary James Jordan, who handled
media relations for Democrats during the Senate's campaign
fundraising investigation of Clinton last year.
</P>
<P>
With his share of the 1.3 million dollars allotted the
Judiciary Committee, Chairman Henry Hyde, a Republican, has hired
nine investigators for the majority. He is permitted five more.
</P>
<P>
Lowell, a graduate of Columbia University law school, has
served in the Justice Department and the U.N. High Commissioner
for Human Rights. He also has been a legal commentator for NBC's
Washington affiliate, WRC-TV, and a columnist for Legal Times.

<HEADLINE> Judge Indicates Starr's Staff May Have Leaked in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton's
lawyers have provided enough evidence to indicate prosecutor
Kenneth Starr's staff probably violated grand jury secrecy laws, a
federal judge has found, according to court documents released
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Clinton and White House aides "have established
prima facie violations" of the secrecy rule that prohibits
disclosure of any grand jury material, U.S. District Judge Norma
Holloway Johnson ruled.
</P>
<P>
Johnson ruled that even one news article with leaked
information could establish a violation. "The court finds that
several articles establish prima facie violations," she said.
</P>
<P>
The records also show that the U.S. Court of Appeals rejected
Starr's efforts to stop Johnson's investigation, allowing her to
continue to collect evidence and hold a hearing to determine if
Starr's office should be punished.
</P>
<P>
The disclosure comes at a sensitive time for Starr, who just
brought White House intern Monica Lewinsky before the grand jury
Thursday and is reportedly nearing a decision on whether to send
Congress an impeachment report.
</P>
<P>
Starr has repeatedly denied leaking grand jury information.
Johnson's ruling was based on numerous news articles that claimed
to cite grand jury evidence from the Lewinsky case. Her decision
means the burden will now shift to Starr to prove his office did
not leak the information and should not be found in contempt of
court.
</P>
<P>
The court said that in the hearing, Starr "now must come
forward with evidence, in whatever form the district court
requires... to rebut the inferences drawn from the news articles"
that led to the allegations.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Bomb Blast Shocks Kenyans in Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- It was just like every weekend
morning, when people do their shopping in the city center of
Nairobi, Kenya's capital, with vehicles shuttling on busy
streets.
</P>
<P>
But as the clock ticked 10:35 a.m. local time, a deafening
explosion was heard in nearly the whole city.
</P>
<P>
The explosion, believed to be a car bomb, near the U.S.
embassy in the city center, claimed about 100 lives and injured
more than 1,000, local sources told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
About 50 people were said to be killed on the spot.
</P>
<P>
So far the exact death toll is still not available.
</P>
<P>
Ufundi House -- a five-storey office block between the U.S.
embassy and the 22-story Cooperative House, was turned into a
pile of debris, with fumes and fires swallowing up cars and
buildings nearby.
</P>
<P>
The whole rear wall of the U.S. embassy was gone, revealing
only five rows of smoke-blackened rooms.
</P>
<P>
Panic-stricken people, many of them with blood in heads, arms
or other parts of their bodies, ran for their lives in all
directions.
</P>
<P>
Matatus (local mini-buses) were seen dashing out from the
blast area, in doomsday-like craziness.
</P>
<P>
Two coaches full of passengers were rendered into horrifying
skeletons, with all glass gone, and about 20 dead immediately as
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Roads around the U.S. embassy were bloodstained and scattered
with pieces of broken window frames, furniture and stones. Glass
on almost all windows within 100 meters of the blast was also
blown away.
</P>
<P>
Ambulances and police vehicles were shuttling from the scene
to hospitals and vice versa in the city well into the night, and
several junctions were closed off by policemen, while helicopters
were hovering over the tragedy scene, coordinating the rescue
work on the ground.
</P>
<P>
U.S. embassy spokesman Chris Scharf told Xinhua by phone in
the evening that eight Americans, including two women and one
child, were killed by the bombing and another 15 wounded with one
still missing.
</P>
<P>
Both U.S. Ambassador to Kenya, Prudence Bushnell and Kenyan
Trade Minister Joseph Kamotho have sustained slight injuries.
</P>
<P>
They were having a meeting in Kamotho's office in the raided
building at the time of the blast.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of rescue workers including soldiers, firemen,
police, international aid workers, were still looking for victims
under the rubble. The rescue work was expected to last several
days.
</P>
<P>
"The rescue is going on. We are doing everything possible to
help those wounded and... to make sure everyone moved out of the
ruins," said Scharf.
</P>
<P>
All the main hospitals in Nairobi are now full of victims,
said eye-witnesses. Blood donators lining up in long queues
before major hospitals in the city after a TV announcement was
broadcast appealing for blood donations.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi Friday evening inspected the
blast scene and visited victims at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
He said he was deeply shocked and condemned the attack, vowing
to try best "to bring the perpetrators of the heinous crime to
book."
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan police said in the evening that they highly suspect
that the bomb blast is a terrorist attack aimed at the Americans.
</P>
<P>
Another bomb explosion rocked the U.S. embassy in Dar es
Salaam, the capital of Tanzania around the same time, at least
killing seven people.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 7 (Xinhua)-- U.N. arms monitors went
out for work as usual today in Baghdad for the second straight
day although Iraq announced Wednesday its suspension of
cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of
scrapping Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
But Iraq refuses to have any dealing with U.N. teams that make
checks, with little advance notice, of sites where they suspect
weapons or weapons-related activities might be found, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Special Committee,led by Australian Richard Butler, has
currently 100 staff in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion of the Special Committee on Iraq's disarmament
would be decisive for the Security Council to consider lifting of
the eight-year sanction against Iraq imposed after its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Security Council Thursday said that
Iraq's announcement Wednesday was "totally unacceptable", and it
urged Baghdad "not to implement its decision."
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the announcement "contravenes the
relevant Security Council resolutions and the memorandum of
understanding" signed in February by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan President Asks Kabila to Justify </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimingu Friday asked Democratic Congo leader Laurent Kabila to
justify his allegations that Rwanda is supporting the rebellion
in the east of former Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving Zambia for Zimbabwe to attend an emergent
regional summit after his three-day stay here, Bizimingu told
reporters at the Lusaka International Airport that Rwanda has no
interest in disrupting peace in Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
He denied that Rwanda is behind the on-going rebellion in the
eastern towns of former Zaire, saying that at the summit,
regional leaders will ask president Kabila to clearly elaborate
on the true picture of the situation in his country.
</P>
<P>
Bizimingu, who arrived in Zambia Wednesday for a three-day
state visit, flew out on the same plane with Zambian President
Frederick Chiluba for the Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe's picturesque
resort town bordering on Zambia.
</P>
<P>
In the past several days, Congo (K) has been blaming the
latest fightings on its ethnic Tutsi Banyamulenge community and
the soldiers from Rwanda's Tutsi-dominated army. The Kinshasa
government also accused Uganda of getting involved in the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
While at a news conference Thursday evening, Kabila stopped
short of a declaration of war against Rwanda, which backed him
last year on his way to toppling former dictator Mobutu Sese Seko
after a seven-month war.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Congolese people to prepare for a long war
and noted that the war should be taken to Rwanda, saying: "we
should prepare for a long drawn-out war, a people's war in which
the entire people should defend its homeland and sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
However, both Rwanda and Uganda have denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
During an official talk with Zambia President Frederick
Chiluba in Lusaka Wednesday, Rwandan President Bizimingu said
that "for the time being, there is no particular reason for his
country to get involved" in Congo's conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government also said Thursday evening that it
wishes to reiterate its policy of good neighborlihood with and
non-interference in Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
The emergent summit was called in order that the regional
leaders could brainstorm on the inflamable situation in Congo (K)
and the flare-ups in Angola where the National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) and the government have begun
amassing troops to resume fighting.
</P>
<P>
The two conflicts and persistent allegations that Rwanda is
backing the Congo rebellion and that Zambia is supplying Angola's
rebel UNITA movement with arms, have created uncertainty on the
future of peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the presidents of Rwanda, Zambia, Namibia,
Tanzania and Uganda have confirmed that they will join host
President Robert Mugabe Friday for the summit.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Announces 5-Day Mourning for Bomb Victims  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President President Moi
declared Friday evening a five-day period of nationwide mourning
</P>
<P>
The whole death toll of the blast has increased to nearly 100
and more than 1,000 wounded have been rushed to hospitals, local
media estimated. So far at least 60 were confirmed dead.
</P>
<P>
During the mourning period, all other social activities such
as school drama festivals stand suspended and flags at all
governmental institutions will fly at half-mast, said Moi.
</P>
<P>
He regretted that U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell got
injured in the bomb blast.
</P>
<P>
Both Bushnell and Kenyan Trade Minister Joseph Kamotho have
sustained slight injuries. Kamotho's office was hosted in the
bombed 22-story Cooperative House just next to the U.S. Embassy.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Moi toured the bombing scene during the peak of
rescue efforts and then visited some wounded including Trade
Minister Joseph Kamotho at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president urged the public to keep calm.
</P>
<P>
The extent of the damage, he explained, will be assessed first
before Kenya could ask for international assistance.
</P>
<P>
The government in a statement issued from State House said the
attack was an act of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"I have directed the security organs to do everything possible
to respond to this situation effectively," said Moi, condemning
the attack and asked for anybody with information that could lead
to arrest of perpetrators, to forward it to police.
</P>
<P>
A number of people - either alive or dead - were still trapped
in the building.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers said they expected the death toll to jump
drastically.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people were also injured when window glass and
pieces of stones shattered from the scene and nearby buildings
flung onto pavements and pathways.
</P>
<P>
Many buildings in the radius of 400 meters from the blast area
had windows and anti-burglar grills shattered. Nearby Cooperative
and National banks were also devastated.
</P>
<P>
The roof of Kenya Railways Headquarters, about 100 meters from
the explosion site, caved in, injuring many.
</P>
<P>
A security official said the bombs were believed to be in a
van parked in an alley between Cooperative House and the embassy.

<HEADLINE> Blast Paralyzes Business in Nairobi  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Business in the Kenyan capital
Nairobi was paralyzed in mid-morning Friday by the bomb blasts
</P>
<P>
About 100 people were feared dead and more than 1,000 were
seriously wounded during the blasts, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
Moments after the explosion, many people in private and
government offices closed business for the day.
</P>
<P>
The city center was almost deserted in the afternoon, when the
central business district is usually very busy as residents go
shopping for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Trading and other operations at the Nairobi Stock Exchange
(NSE) were stopped when traders left the trading floor after the
bomb blasts.
</P>
<P>
Officials said trading had started as usual until the blasts
shook the city. Dealers joined other curious Kenyans in the rush
to "safe exit" following the deafening bang of the bomb.
</P>
<P>
The NSE was unmanned for most of the afternoon as the workers
seemed to have left for home. Only a few deals were said to have
concluded before the explosion.
</P>
<P>
Normal operations were also paralyzed as hospitals prepared to
take in casualties of the blasts.
</P>
<P>
Vehicles on Haile Selassie, Moi and Harambee avenues were
badly damaged and their occupants seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
The damage virtually made walking in town impossible as the
streets were littered with broken glass and pieces of paper
documents blown from the affected buildings.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people thronged the scene, many of them weeping
uncontrollably as they tried to find out the fate of their
friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
Buildings near the scene had all window panes broken and some
parts of the walls were partially destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Cooperative House, which houses the Teachers Service
Commission, had all its window panes blown up. Many of those who
work in the building were seriously injured.
</P>
