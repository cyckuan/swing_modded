   LOS ANGELES _ Like a runaway bull market, gasoline prices in the
Los Angeles area continued their rapid rise on Thursday and in some
cases jumped 10 cents from the previous day's level.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden price surge, which saw the cost of a gallon of gas
jump by 25 cents during the past 14 days, could last for at least
two more weeks or possibly a bit longer, analysts and industry
officials predicted.
</P>
<P>
   A gallon of premium gasoline was selling for more than $1.70 a
gallon and regular unleaded for more than $1.40 a gallon at a
number of stations on Thursday, stunning market watchers and
commuters alike.
</P>
<P>
   Prices have been going up from 4 cents to 10 cents a day for the
past two weeks, according to Auto California, a trade group that
represents the state's service stations and repair shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like the largest increase in the shortest amount of
time that we've ever had,'' said Susan Garfield, a spokeswoman for
the California Energy Commission, which keeps tabs on production at
the state's 13 refineries.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is so frustrating that a coalition of community
groups, including the Minorities for Tobacco, Alcohol and Drug Free
Cities; the Adoptive Families Foundation; and Congress of Racial
Equality today will stage a protest downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe Barry, pastor of the California Christian Center in
Compton, Calif., said that the coalition will call for a federal
investigation into the sudden price hike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to lay out several recommendations for government
regulation on gas price increases,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But industry officials rounded up the usual suspects in doling
out blame for the recent increases: a shrinking supply, increased
demand because of the holidays, production stoppages at refineries
in Northern and Southern California and an OPEC production cutback
that started Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies, including the region's leading retailer,
Atlantic Richfield Co., are now restricting the amount of gasoline
they will sell to dealers.
</P>
<P>
   For the next month, Arco dealers will only receive the same
amount of gas they sold in March instead of being able to buy
however much they think they can sell, according to Paul Langland,
a spokesman at Arco Products Co., the big refinery's marketing arm.
</P>
<P>
   Arco's gasoline production was recently interrupted several
times because of equipment problems at its refinery in Carson,
Calif. As a result, the refinery could not produce gasoline for one
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found ourselves ... short on gasoline. We're hoping to make
it to the end of the month without running out of gasoline to sell
to our stations,'' Langland said.
</P>
<P>
   To help ease the shortage, Arco is bringing gasoline in from the
Gulf Coast on tanker ships. He declined to say how much fuel the
company was importing.
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, doubt that supplies had slipped enough to cause
such a big price spike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Current gasoline production levels will not continue to
support the high prices consumers have been paying at the pump,''
Energy Commission Chairman William J. Keese said in a statement
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's assessment of state supplies found that March's
production of 880,000 barrels per day was 96 percent of normal for
the month. And 12 of the state's 13 refiners are producing gasoline
for the state's passenger vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This marker has been fueled by speculation during tight
supplies over the past two weeks, and consumers are feeling the
pinch,'' Keese said.
</P>
<P>
   Will Woods, Auto California's executive director, said that
distributors who sell to independents worried about severe
shortages, and this contributed to the run-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They basically bid up the price on the spot market,'' he said.
``It's basically an overreaction to conditions that may result from
the factors in the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Prices could start sliding back down in about two weeks, Woods
said. &QL;

ADVERTISING: AGENCIES USING WIDE RANGE OF FORMULAS TO SET
PAYMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS 5th graf to add Procter &AMP; Gamble) (rk) 
 By   PATRICIA WINTERS LAURO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The 15 percent commission on media spending that
clients pay advertising agencies as their fee was once standard in
the advertising business. Now it is about as dead as the
three-martini lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate America is turning away from billings-based
commissions in large numbers, and many now routinely look at a wide
range of new formulas that can be custom &UR;  &LR; tailored for a client's
needs. The new methods of agency payments may include anything from
straight hourly fees for labor to performance incentive fees to
fixed retainers, or a variety of combinations.
</P>
<P>
   Driving the changes are two key factors: belt-tightening clients
who began cutting commissions more than a decade ago, and vast
changes in how ad agencies reach consumers that go way beyond
network TV advertising. The commission formula tends to encourage
costly media buys and has been criticized for overlooking important
emerging mediums such as the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Together it amounts to a sea change in how agencies are paid,
which is underscored by the fact that giants like Young &AMP; Rubicam
and DDB Needham Worldwide, a unit of Omnicom Group, now oppose the
structure that once made Madison Avenue very profitable.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's top two advertisers, the General Motors &UR;  &LR; Corp &UR; . &LR; 
and Procter &AMP; Gamble, are both moving away from billings-based
compensation plans. GM spent $3.09 billion in advertising and
promotion in 1997, and P&AMP;G spent $2.74 billion, according to
Advertising Age, the industry trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble now pays media commissions but will soon change
that. In July, the company will institute a series of tests around
the globe that will determine how ``to link financial rewards of
our agencies to increased sales revenue'' at P&AMP;G, said Gretchen
Briscoe, a P&AMP;G spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional commission does not reward increased sales or
development of holistic marketing plans,'' Ms. Briscoe said. ``We
want a system that's media neutral.''
</P>
<P>
   GM has been using a variety of compensation programs over the
last decade, ranging from traditional commissions to straight fees
to performance incentives. The auto giant is now working toward ``a
performance-based fee compensation'' system with agencies ``where
we don't already have one,'' said Philip Guarascio, GM's vice
president for advertising and corporate marketing.
</P>
<P>
   One key advantage to performance fees is that they encourage
agencies to think about how to promote as broadly as possible,
utilizing every marketing resource available from web site design
to Internet marketing, Guarascio said. It also requires the
discipline to set and later evaluate very specific goals that keep
both the agency and the client on target.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just about doing the work, it's about how well the
work is done _ that's what accountability is about,'' Guarascio
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, only 35 percent of advertisers paid their agencies
based on media commissions, down from 61 percent three years
earlier, according to a study by the Association of National
Advertisers Inc., a New York-based trade group. Meantime, the study
showed just 9 percent of respondents paid agencies 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Though that would seemingly be bad news for ad agencies,
especially the giants that routinely handle accounts that spend $50
million in media and more (translation: $7.5 million in
commissions), DDB Needham says the opposite is the case: the
changes are not happening fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Reinhard, DDB Needham's chairman and chief executive
officer, said the old system undervalues an agency by paying a flat
rate that is not based on merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ludicrous because it doesn't talk about quality,''
Reinhard said. ``If we're going to be brand architects and
strategists, we have to figure out a way to get paid for our
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission system was developed in the last century as a way
to attract agents to place ads in newspapers, said Robert Lundin of
Jones-Lundin, the Chicago-based consultancy that conducted the
trade group study.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 percent figure was ``picked out of a hat'' and never well
loved among clients, Lundin said. But it was not until the
mid-1980s that cost-conscious clients began reducing commissions en
masse, creating something of a panic in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts ``tapped into a pent-up anger clients had about paying
15 percent, whether an agency performed or not,'' said Edward H.
Vick, Young &AMP; Rubicam's chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   In classic Madison Avenue fashion, agencies have since turned
clients' lemons into lemonade, by coming up with new formulas that
can earn an agency even more than a 15 percent commission, said
Lundin. Last year, DDB Needham made some $6 million in additional
compensation beyond its base fees for reaching client objectives,
Reinhard said.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the 15 percent commission's demise has actually
benefited some small agencies because commissions on small media
budgets often do not adequately pay agencies for their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount of work you do for a client with a $4 million or $5
million budget is very often the same amount as the client with the
$10 million or $15 million budget,'' said Adam Stagliano, president
of Weiss Stagliano Inc., a New York shop with about $100 million in
billings.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes that means more than a 15 percent commission.
Ciociola &UR;  &LR; &AMP; Co., a $50 million shop also in the city, often takes a
guaranteed fee with a provision to take the greater of either fees
or media commission, Mel Ciociola, the agency's chairman, said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``Flexibility is the watchword,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While labor-based compensation agreements now outpace
billings-based payments, according to the trade group study, more
than 30 percent of advertisers now also include some type of
incentive compensation agreement that ties bonus money to the
agency's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Young &AMP; Rubicam said the performance might be based on increased
sales, or on other qualitative research measures such as brand
preference or consumer awareness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incentive compensation says that we'll take less up front and
if we're successful, we have an opportunity to make a lot more
money,'' Vick said. ``We're saying we're willing to put a large
part of our profit at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   On the downside, linking advertising to sales revenue can be
risky because often problems beyond the scope of advertising cause
a brand to fail, such as the wrong price point or poor
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Lundin, whose company conducted the trade group study, said that
this problem may soon be solved because a more exact formula to
measure the success of advertising has been defined in the academic
world, and he expects it will be adopted by business in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Still, until then, incentives tied to sales remain a risk _
though some agencies consider it worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our clients take those risks every day,'' Reinhardt said, ``so
why shouldn't we?''

FIRST LADY TO RAISE MONEY FOR POTENTIAL DEMOCRATIC RIVAL FOR N.Y.
SENATE SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton has agreed to appear at a
fund-raiser for Rep. Nita M. Lowey, another potential candidate for
a Senate seat from New York, in an effort to allay concerns that
the first lady's prospective candidacy is disrupting the
fund-raising efforts of other Democratic hopefuls, party officials
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lowey's aides said she anticipated raising $500,000 from the
planned $1,000-a-plate dinner appearance by Mrs. Clinton on May 24
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The monetary goal is a testimony to the first lady's
fund-raising appeal and strong standing among New York Democrats.
By way of comparison, Ms. Lowey's entire political bank account was
$842,000 as of December.
</P>
<P>
   It is unusual for a prospective candidate to help a possible
rival raise money for a campaign. Mrs. Clinton's agreement to help
Ms. Lowey is the latest indication of the ways that the first
lady's interest in elective office has tangled the political
situation in New York as Democrats prepare for the 2000 Senate
race.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton announced earlier this year that she was
considering seeking the nomination for the seat held by Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, who is retiring next year at the end of his
fourth term. Ms. Lowey, a representative from Westchester County,
has also said that she would like to run for Moynihan's seat but
would not seek the nomination if Mrs. Clinton enters the race.
</P>
<P>
   Although the election is about 18 months away, the unusual
prospect of the first lady moving out of the White House and to New
York to run for office has created a potential problem for
Democrats, who are intent on not losing Moynihan's seat to the
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   While Mrs. Clinton's prospective candidacy has generated
considerable interest among party leaders, it has also effectively
halted Ms. Lowey's early fund-raising efforts, New York Democrats
say.
</P>
<P>
   If Mrs. Clinton runs, that would not matter. But if Mrs. Clinton
announces later this year that she will not run, Ms. Lowey _ who is
not well known outside Westchester, and does not have much of a
fund-raising base _ would be left on a ledge. Normally, now would
be a time when Ms. Lowey would be tending to fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   While he was a representative from Brooklyn, Sen. Charles E.
Schumer spent almost six years raising the $12 million he used to
defeat Alfonse M. D'Amato last year.
</P>
<P>
   The leading Republican who has expressed an interest in the 2000
Senate race is Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who, if he won the
nomination, would probably not have difficulty raising money, given
his political stature in New York, Democrats and Republicans say.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Hope, chairwoman of the state Democratic Party, said she
and Mrs. Clinton had discussed the problem and the first lady had
suggested that she was prepared to do something now on Ms. Lowey's
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's fully aware of the consequences of her taking some time
to consider whether or not to make this race,'' Ms. Hope said
Thursday. ``And she is fully willing to do whatever is necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She expressed her concern _ and I concurred _ that this is an
issue that needs to be addressed,'' Ms. Hope said. ``She was quick
to assure me that however this turns out, she will aggressively
raise money for the Democratic nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials said Mrs. Clinton's decision to raise money
for Ms. Lowey should not be taken as any indication of what the
first lady might do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it means anything with regard to her own
intentions,'' said Howard Wolfson, Ms. Lowey's spokesman. ``It
means everything with regard to her keeping the Senate seat
Democratic.''

SPREWELL THE STARTER RIDES THE BENCH DURING KNICKS' RALLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Latrell Sprewell absorbed a glorious introduction,
with laser lights and flashbulbs as his escorts, when he jogged
onto the court as part of the Knicks' starting lineup. This is what
he had campaigned for, the thrill of being a starter.
</P>
<P>
   But this is where his fulfillment ended Thursday night. Sprewell
was not apart of the grandeur when a collection of B-movie players
_ guys like Marcus Camby and Chris Childs _ scrambled to make up a
13-point, third-quarter deficit and picked up the pieces around
Patrick Ewing's forgettable night from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, nursing a sore Achilles' tendon, hit only 2 of 12 shots,
but Childs came through and scored 9 fourth-quarter points, while
Camby came up with 5 rebounds and a key block in the final 10
minutes of a 78-74 victory against the Cleveland Cavaliers at
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in place of the injured Larry Johnson, Sprewell was on
the bench for the last eight minutes of the game and missed the
bulk of an 18-9 run that erased the Cavs' 13-point lead in the
third. Sprewell ended the game just 3 of 9 for 11 points, and he
had 4 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask Jeff,'' said Sprewell, when questioned on why he wasn't in
the game at the end. ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jeff Van Gundy had a simple answer. He played the hottest
hand. Childs, who scored 11 points, changed the mood of the game
when he parlayed a driving layup into a foul and 3-point play; and
then, as an encore, delivered a 3-pointer to give the Knicks a
lead, 66-65, with 5 minutes 39 seconds left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   To get to that point, the Knicks forced seven turnovers in 10
minutes and forced their way inside on offense to get to the
free-throw line. In the fourth quarter, the Knicks hit 10 of 11
free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ewing, who re-injured his Achilles' against Indiana in
his 37-point performance on Tuesday, was not hitting his shot, he
did sink two free throws with 39.4 seconds left in the game to give
the Knicks a 75-73 lead during a back-and-forth finish.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavaliers, led by Shawn Kemp's 25 points, had a chance to
win the game on an open 3-pointer by Derek Anderson with 6.9
seconds left. He missed, the Cavs got the rebound, but Brevin
Knight was off on an 18-foot jumper. For the second game in a row,
the Knicks escaped a defeat at the buzzer. Perhaps their fortunes
are starting to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stayed strong mentally,'' Van Gundy said. ``We're going to
struggle offensively when our main players don't shoot well, but I
felt the other guys stepped it up. I liked the way we came back in
the fourth. You have to win games like that when your best
offensive players aren't scoring.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sprewell experiment sent the Knicks into a dysfunctional
tailspin for much of the game. With Sprewell starting and stirring
up the system by pushing the ball at every turn, Ewing and Houston
were thrown off their games.
</P>
<P>
   With Sprewell on the floor, the Knicks were down by 11 points
two minutes into the second quarter before he was taken out for the
remainder of the half. After the Knicks pulled to within 39-35 at
the half, Sprewell came out as a starter in the third quarter and
the Cavaliers went on a 15-8 run.
</P>
<P>
   With four turnovers, Sprewell was the common element as the
Knicks trailed by as many as 13 in the third, but he was by no
means the only reason the crowd turned on their team and sent a
cascade of boos down to greet them.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp was not Sprewell's responsibility. Not only did Kemp bump
Ewing outside and away from the basket, he scored 14 first-half
points. Meanwhile, Ewing missed 8 of his first 10 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Once Kemp went to the bench for a break, the Knicks capitalized
on the vulnerable Cavaliers, who turned the ball over five times in
the final 4:24 of the third quarter. The Knicks stumbled
themselves, but pulled to within 59-52 entering the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Sprewell made his exit. Mostly, he was a
distraction to the Knicks' half-court ways with Ewing on the floor.
Camby entered the game for Ewing with three minutes left in the
first quarter and the Knicks down by 16-13.
</P>
<P>
   Things just grew worse before Camby found his groove during the
game. After Kemp hammered away inside against a collection of
Knicks and Danny Ferry darted to the perimeter in front of Camby
for two straight jumpers to start off the second quarter, the
Cavaliers took a 26-17 lead. That lead grew to 12 points before the
Knicks returned to their normal offense.
</P>
<P>
   Without Sprewell and Camby on the floor for the last 10 minutes
of the first half, the Knicks leaned on Ewing and Houston during a
10-2 run that was topped by a 3-pointer from Charlie Ward. Ewing
was just 2 for 8 in the first half and the Knicks shot just 33
percent in the half.
</P>
<P>
   REBOUNDS

<P>
   PATRICK EWING was spared the worst of the league's punishment
following his fracas with Indiana's JALEN ROSE during the second
quarter of the Knicks' victory Tuesday. After ROD THORN, the vice
president of basketball operations, reviewed the incident Thursday,
Ewing was fined $2,500 for escalating the tension by charging
toward Rose after he was intentionally tripped by the Pacers'
forward. Rose was suspended for one game and fined $5,000 for
tripping Ewing and throwing a forearm that inadvertently struck the
official, DICK BAVETTA, and broke his nose. ... LATRELL SPREWELL's
starting job may be short-lived. LARRY JOHNSON was churning the
stationery bike in the back of the Knicks' training room before
Thursday night's game with surprising freedom. An hour earlier, he
ran up and down the Madison Square Garden court without feeling too
much discomfort less than 48 hours after he sprained the medial
collateral ligament in his right knee against the Indiana Pacers.
``It feels pretty good,'' said Johnson. ``It feels better than I
expected. It looks good for Sunday.'' The Knicks play Indiana on
Sunday. &QL;

NETS WIN A BIG ONE, BUT WILLIAMS IS LOST 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ These are ill-fated times for the Nets.
After numerous injuries, the firing of their coach and
disappointing play, their finest victory of the season Thursday
night was overshadowed by a season-ending injury to Jayson
Williams, their top rebounder and spiritual leader.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who has played all season with a broken nose and
damaged left thumb, broke a bone in his right leg when he collided
with Stephon Marbury with 50.9 seconds left in the Nets' 90-85
victory over the Atlanta Hawks (19-13) at Continental Arena. After
laying on the floor for several minutes, Williams was helped off
the court and taken on a stretcher to the Hackensack Medical Center
for X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   Williams suffered a displaced tibial plateau fracture and is
likely out for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like we're snakebitten,'' said Kendall Gill, who
sparked the Nets to their sixth victory. ``Things finally go right
and still something goes wrong. We're happy with the win. I hope
that Jay is all right. I know he's hurt because Jayson doesn't get
hurt. Even if he's hurting he'll get up. That's the first time I've
ever seen him not get up. Hopefully, he's okay.''
</P>
<P>
   With Rony Seikaly (right foot) and Jim McIlvaine (left shoulder)
already injured, the Nets' top three centers are out indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who grabbed 10 rebounds in 39 minutes, was injured
doing what he does better than anyone in the National Basketball
Association _ attacking the basket for an offensive rebound. After
outscoring the Hawks by 29-14 in the third quarter, the Nets were
leading by 85-83 when Marbury sliced through Atlanta's defense to
sink a running 7-footer.
</P>
<P>
   When Marbury left his feet to put up a shot, Williams began
getting into position for a rebound. While in the air, Marbury was
brushed by Atlanta's Dikembe Mutombo and then run into by the
hard-charging Williams, who hit him in the back with his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury landed awkwardly on Williams' right leg, forcing the
6-foot-10-inch center to the floor. While the Hawks ran the ball
upcourt, Marbury and Williams laid beneath the basket nearly
motionless with their legs tangled.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury had the wind knocked out of him and got up after a few
minutes. At first, he appeared to be just as seriously injured as
Williams, and his mother, Mable, ran across the court from her seat
to see if he was OK. The two hugged when Marbury arose, and while
his mother walked back to her seat, Marbury ran after her and
hugged her at midcourt, to the cheers of 14,348 fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was scary,'' said Marbury, who provided a clutch
performance by scoring 11 of his game-high 27 points in the fourth
quarter. ``I got caught in the back and usually you get the wind
knocked out of you from the front. I was trying to recover my
breath. I couldn't breathe.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom was just worried. That's just how she is. I told her I
was all right and she said she doesn't care about me playing
basketball as long as she has me.''
</P>
<P>
   Though excited about beating Atlanta, the best road team in the
league with a 10-5 record, the Nets were distraught about losing
their heart and soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you lose a player of his caliber, it hurts,'' said
Keith Van Horn, who had 24 points and 9 rebounds after missing two
games with a sprained right ankle. ``But to lose Jayson, who has
fought through everything this year is really tough. It's going to
be hard to replace him because he might be the hardest-working guy
in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   REBOUNDS
</P>
<P>
   STEPHON MARBURY wrote ``KG 21, I See U'' on his ankle tape
Thursday night in honor of his former Minnesota Timberwolves
teammate, KEVIN GARNETT. ``I just wanted to say what's up to him,''
Marbury said &UR;  &LR; . . . ERIC MURDOCK, who has been on the injured list
with a sore left knee since March 12, was recently told by a doctor
in Miami that the knee has a stress fracture. He was told to rest
for another week and a half and then attempt to return . . . JAMIE
FEICK &UR;  &LR; was signed to his second 10-day contract Thursday. WILL
CUNNINGHAM &UR;  &LR; will be signed to his second 10-day contract Friday and
MARK HENDRICKSON will be signed to one on Sunday . . . SCOTT
BURRELL (sprained right ankle) said he expects to be activated from
the injured list early next week. RONY SEIKALY &UR;  &LR; (plantar fasciaitis
in right foot) will then be placed on the injured list. &QL;

MAVS STICK WITH REGULARS, PUT DOWN CLIPPERS
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Mavericks have their self-esteem back, thanks to
the NBA sending the lowly Los Angeles Clippers to Reunion Arena
last night.
</P>
<P>
   And, thanks, also to Mavericks coach and general manager Don
Nelson for holding off on that youth movement at least for a game
or two.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson played his five starters 34 or more minutes, and the
Mavericks needed every ounce of their energy to slip past the
Clippers, 93-84, before an announced crowd of 13,336. The victory
was the Mavericks' third in the past 11 games, and that it came
against the league's worst team didn't go unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a nightmare,'' guard Steve Nash said of a
potential loss to the 3-27 Clippers. ``I hate to say it, but a lot
of times you say it can't get any worse, and it has.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would have actually gone way down on the scale. So it's
best to get this win. It was immeasurable for our confidence _ at
least salvaging it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks shot 50.7 percent from the field _ only the third
time they eclipsed the 50 percent barrier this season _ and snapped
a three-game losing streak. Dallas takes an 11-22 record into their
one and only three-day break of the season before taking on the
Minnesota Timberwolves on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson didn't take many chances dabbling with his bench. He
played four reserves a total of 48 minutes, as he wanted to make
sure the Clippers team that racked up wins over Utah, Minnesota and
Sacramento wasn't going to sneak into town and wreck this team even
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hard-fought game for us, and we had to do whatever we
could do to win this one tonight,'' Nelson said. ``If I had to play
five guys 48 minutes each _ whatever it took to win this game _ I
thought it was important that we do that, and we did that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bench didn't get that much of an opportunity tonight, but
there will be other games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers didn't go quietly into the night. They erased an
early 12-point deficit, led at one point by six points and only
trailed 81-80 with less than five minutes left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Finley scored eight of his 22 points down the
stretch as the Mavericks increased their home record to 9-8. It's
their best home start after 17 games since going 11-6 in the
1989-90 season.
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks forward Gary Trent had 11 points, six rebounds and
three assists in dominating the first quarter, which ended with the
Mavericks nursing a 28-18 lead. But the Clippers fought back to
lead 46-44 at the half, only to see the Mavericks regroup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to play within the flow of the offense,'' said
Trent, who finished with 23 points, 11 rebounds and six assists.
``We had a balanced attack, and the biggest thing is we helped each
other a whole lot on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Nash finished with a flourish, totaling 12 points (5-of-6
shooting), nine assists, a season-high seven rebounds and three
steals. Shawn Bradley had 16 points, 13 rebounds and five blocks,
and A.C. Green collected 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a game that we thought we should win and get this
monkey off our backs,'' Nelson said. ``We just approached it as we
have to figure out a way to do that, and we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley said focusing on the task at hand was somewhat difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy for us to get in and have intensity going up against
a team like the Lakers,'' Finley said. `'But when you're going up
against a team like the Clippers, who have been struggling,
mentally you have to be focused. And I think for the most part we
were like that tonight.''

SEHORN TESTS KNEE (JUST DON'T TELL GIANTS) 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jason Sehorn, recovering from major reconstructive knee surgery,
didn't tell the Giants he was planning to defend his championship
in the Superstars competition when it was held last month in
Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want them to get all worried,'' Sehorn said from his
California home Thursday. ``You know, I'm a big investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Giants Coach Jim Fassel admitted Thursday that had he known
Sehorn was competing, ``my heart might have been in my mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I trust Jason,'' Fassel said. ``He's smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently _ despite tearing the anterior cruciate and medial
collateral ligaments in his right knee in a preseason game last
Aug. 20 _ he's also fit.
</P>
<P>
   Sehorn won the competition again, defeating a collection of
athletes from various sports, including the Olympic decathlon
champion Dan O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy's got to do what a guy's got to do,'' Sehorn said,
laughing. ``I knew what I was doing. It was fun to get out and be
an athlete again instead of inside some gym riding a stationary
bike.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Sehorn stood at the start of the swimming portion of
the competition, his stomach was in knots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea if I could swim,'' he said. ``I hadn't swum
since the Superstars last year. What if I jump in the water and the
knee doesn't work? What if I can't kick? I was nervous and I never
get nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran down the beach, jumped in and I was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   He won the swimming competition, and the biking part of the
competition and the kayaking. He was second in weight lifting to
the Tampa Bay defensive lineman Warren Sapp, second in the
half-mile run and the jet-ski race, and third in golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite amazing, isn't he?'' Fassel said when he heard Sehorn
had won the Superstars competition again.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors in the event, which will be televised by CBS
Saturday and Sunday, are required to enter seven of 10 events.
Because of his knee, Sehorn chose to avoid the 100-yard dash, the
basketball competition and the obstacle course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ended up doing the obstacle course anyway,'' Sehorn said.
``I was showing some other people how to do it and next thing I
knew I was climbing up and over the 15-foot wall anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Sehorn expected O'Brien to be his chief competition and was
flabbergasted when he wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Dan finished fourth over all,'' Sehorn said. ``To beat
him was nice. He's the world's best athlete? Yeah, well, don't take
him off the track. He was a nice guy, I'll say that. But Joey
Galloway smoked him in the 100.''
</P>
<P>
   Galloway is a Seattle Seahawks Pro Bowl wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Sehorn called his time in Jamaica a beginning to another stage
of his long comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't give me any false hope when it comes to football,''
Sehorn said. ``My knee felt great but I wasn't playing football. I
know there's a big difference. The Superstars was a venue for me to
get started. I had told my trainers in rehab in November that I was
going to defend my title.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were like, `Yeah, sure, whatever.' But I put March in my
mind for motivation. Next I'm looking forward to minicamp in May.''
</P>
<P>
   Sehorn estimated his knee was 85-90 percent of what it needs to
be for the rigors of his cornerback position. He said he has been
working out so often that he's added 10 pounds of muscle and now
weighs 222 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never worked this hard before in my life,'' he said.
``I'll be just as quick and agile but I can't promise you I'll be
100 percent this season. I know I'll feel pain. I wake up some
mornings and my knee is sore. It's not like I don't know which knee
had the operation. But it's a process and I don't have to play a
game for another five months.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel said the Giants doctors have given him nothing but
positive reports on Sehorn's progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been running on the beach and roller blading and lifting
weights,'' Fassel said, ``so the Superstars thing wasn't any
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that New England running back Robert Edwards sustained
what may be a career-ending knee injury in an exhibition event on
sand in January, Fassel said:
</P>
<P>
   ``He was playing touch football in the sand. Jason wasn't
playing football. He was running on sand. Some people will tell you
that's the best thing for your legs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sehorn, always optimistic and upbeat, seemed especially
energized by his success in the Superstars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a blast,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But before the event, he didn't want publicity about his
appearance in the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that was then, now it's OK,'' Sehorn said Thursday. ``If
I'd got hurt, I'd be down at CBS telling them, `You can't air
that.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But hey, I won.'' &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Allied forces Thursday destroyed a bridge over the
Danube River in Serbia and attacked a Serbian mechanized column
that had been involved in the purges in Kosovo, Pentagon officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here and in Europe insisted that the shock of having
three American soldiers captured and shown on Yugoslavia's official
television did not affect the pace or intensity of Thursday's
raids.
</P>
<P>
   The destruction of the bridge in the city of Novi Sad was the
first target in NATO's campaign that could disrupt the lives of
ordinary Serbs, not just the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   American officials otherwise provided scant details about
Thursday's bombing. They declined to say which targets were hit in
central Kosovo or whether the attacks were carried out by cruise
missiles or warplanes. They also did not explain why NATO left
intact one of the two bridges that cross the Danube in Novi Sad, a
city in Serbia about 45 miles northwest of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The main problem, they said, was the weather.
</P>
<P>
   Since the air and missile strikes began nine days ago, American
and allied fighters and bombers have had only one day largely
uninterrupted by rain and fog, that makes striking targets on the
ground infinitely more difficult, even for pilots flying the most
advanced airplanes and firing the most sophisticated missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The United States reacted angrily Thursday to reports from
Yugoslavia that the three captured soldiers might be put on trial,
saying this would be a violation of international law.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, said: ``The fact
is it was illegal for them to be abducted. Such a trial is
obviously ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon asserted Thursday night that the captured
Americans, who were seized near the border between Macedonia and
Yugoslavia, should be considered prisoners of war and treated
according to the rules of the Geneva Convention.
</P>
<P>
   More than a day after the disappearance of the three men,
identified as Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles;
Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich., and
Specialist Steven M. Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville, Texas, there was
still considerable confusion about the circumstances of their
capture. There were conflicting reports on their location and
mission along a rough, hostile border, and contentions of little
firepower backing them up. The Pentagon said that among the many
unknown factors was whether they were captured by Yugoslav troops,
by border police or by some of the many ethnic Serb villagers of
Macedonia who are armed and openly sympathize with the Yugoslav
Serbs. The Pentagon was also trying to determine where the soldiers
were being held.
</P>
<P>
   American and NATO forces in Macedonia did not call off the
search for the three until they were seen, looking battered and
bruised, on Serbian television.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs maintained that the men, members of the First
Squadron, Fourth Cavalry of the First Infantry Division, had been
on Yugoslav territory when they were captured, while Pentagon
officials said they believed that the men were on the Macedonia
side of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, officials, giving out information on condition
of anonymity, released a brief transcript of the radio transmission
between the three soldiers and their base.
</P>
<P>
   One of the patrol said: ``We're in contact. We're taking direct
fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The reply warned that the patrol had better not be joking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not,'' came the response. ``We're taking direct fire.
We're trapped.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all around us. We can't get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Alliance officials acknowledged that the Serbs were pressing
ahead with their attacks in Kosovo, and one said that Belgrade had
already achieved many of its military objectives. But the officials
said that in recent days, the air attacks had begun to diminish the
Serbs' ability to wage war.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, said at the alliance
headquarters that the the strikes had already caused ``substantial
damage'' to the armed forces involved in the crackdown against
ethnic Albanians, who make up most of Kosovo's population. NATO's
secretary general, Javier Solana, said that while NATO's raids have
been hampered, they were having a cumulative impact on the forces
of President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ring is closing around the Yugoslav armed forces,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior NATO diplomat said that after nine days of bombardments
there were indications that the Yugoslavs were having problems
receiving ammunition and fuel, though refugees continued to leave
their villages and head for Kosovo's borders with Macedonia and
Albania. American and NATO forces have struck several depots used
to stockpile supplies, including another fuel depot in Kosovo
Thursday, the Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from a briefing on Capitol Hill, the chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee, John Warner, said that in the last
48 hours there had been ``positive signs that this air campaign is
causing problems for Milosevic's deployed troops conducting ethnic
cleansing in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The tanks and other military vehicles are running short on
fuel,'' the Virginia Republican said. ``Food and ammunition is
running short. And we're having, I think, a considerable success
rate in destroying their supply depots.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, the NATO commander, said the air war now included ``a
slightly larger array of targets,'' including some of Yugoslavia's
civilian structures, which have nominal military uses. He dismissed
Serbian charges that NATO was targeting civilians, but said NATO's
forces would pound any target thought to aid Yugoslavia's military.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insofar as it's drawing reinforcements and supplies and extra
materiel and so forth from throughout Yugoslavia,'' he said, ``the
routes throughout Yugoslavia are legitimate targets. And when we
deem it appropriate, then they will be struck.''
</P>
<P>
   The bridge over the Danube, Europe's longest waterway, was
struck before dawn in the city of Novi Sad, northwest of Yugoslav's
capital and far from the crackdown in Kosovo. The steel suspension
span was one of two that cross the river near Novi Sad's center. A
squadron of American F-15 strike jets left it a crumpled mass in
the river.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Thursday night why NATO forces did not attack
Novi Sad's other bridge or major transit points in other parts of
Yugoslavia, though officials said much of the decisions on striking
targets swung with the fickleness of Balkan weather. They did not
rule out that the other, older bridge in Novi Sad could be struck.
</P>
<P>
   Senior NATO and American officials said the expansion of targets
would accelerate as the weather cleared, which forecasts predict it
will by the weekend.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   NATO's political leadership approved the expansion of targets at
a meeting in Brussels, Belgium, on Tuesday, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Although NATO officials have repeatedly said they have the
forces they need to wage the air war against Yugoslavia, the United
States and other NATO powers, including Britain and France, have
bolstered the number of aircraft in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week the United States dispatched five B-1 bombers.
Thursday, Secretary of Defense William Cohen ordered 13 more F-117
``stealth'' fighters to Italy. They will join 11 others that have
been taking part in the raids. A 12th F-117 was shot down over
Serbia on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Two more Navy warships _ the Ross, a destroyer, and the Vella
Gulf, a cruiser _ entered the Mediterranean Thursday loaded with
cruise missiles and are expected to join the assault soon. The
aircraft carrier, Theodore Roosevelt, is expected to arrive by the
weekend, bringing with it some 75 aircraft, 50 of them combat jets.
</P>
<P>
   The question remained: would they arrive soon enough? A senior
Pentagon official said that Milosevic's forces, although pummeled,
appeared to be wrapping up a campaign to carve out a Serb-enclave
in Kosovo, having cornered the last remnants of ethnic Albanian
rebels known as the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's basically got every objective he wanted,'' the official
said, citing intelligence reports from Kosovo. ``He's destroyed the
KLA and chased everyone else out.''
</P>
<P>
   American warplanes have flown 60 to 70 percent of the strikes,
largely because the United States has more aircraft suited to foul
weather and able to evade radar, a Pentagon official said. But the
allied contribution has been significant, making up at least half
the total missions flown.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has repeatedly refused to quantify how many missions have
been flown in the air war or break them down by country or
distinguish between bombing runs and support activities such as
refueling.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's raids were overshadowed by the seizure of the
Americans, something that the White House and the Pentagon,
recalling the capture of American troops in Somalia in 1993, had
deeply feared.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, in Norfolk, Va., initially described the three soldiers
as ``illegal detainees'' rather than prisoners of war, but by the
end of the day, the Pentagon described them as POWs and demanded
that they not be brought before a military trial in Kosovo, as the
Yugoslav authorities threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, said Thursday evening that
depending on the circumstances of their capture _ namely whether
they were inside Macedonia or had strayed into Serbia _ the three
``may be'' entitled to immediate release.
</P>
<P>
   He said that, pending an investigation and, ideally, the direct
questioning of the three, ``our belief'' is that they did not
violate the Yugoslav border. ``The soldiers should be released
immediately,'' he said at another point, contending that ``at a
minimum'' they were entitled to the protections of the Geneva
Convention, which calls for the humane treatment of the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Given the border tensions of the situation, some critics
questioned whether the three soldiers observed regulations and
should have been better protected by operating within some larger
formation better able to defend itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm astounded,'' said a retired senior Army officer familiar
with the Balkans. ``In Bosnia, we figured one of our
vulnerabilities was a hostage snatch or an ambush.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner said their capture raised questions. He said the United
States had been on ``full notice'' that the Serbs ``would like to
seize'' a NATO serviceman. ``And that's precisely what happened,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon declined to say whether lax procedures might have been a
factor, but said an investigation was underway. ``I don't think
I'll second-guess what's going on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Henry Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said a possibility was that the Americans inadvertently crossed the
border while fleeing an ambush by Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said that among the many unknown factors was
whether they were captured by Yugoslav troops or border police or
by some of the many local Macedonian Serb villagers who are armed
and openly sympathize with the Yugoslav Serbs. Scores of troops and
several helicopters, Bacon said, were dispatched in a ``massive''
search for the three in poor weather, without result. The Americans
armored vehicle _ a Humvee _ remains missing.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said that three Humvees had been on patrol, then split up
``to do some individual training exercises'' that he did not
otherwise describe. They had been working near a border observation
post inside Macedonia, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said he would hold the Yugoslav authorities responsible
for their well-being.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all seen their pictures,'' he said. ``We don't like it.
We don't like the way they're treated. And we have a long memory
about these kinds of things.''

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
SALT LAKE CITY _ This time, there was no way the Rockets would
allow John Stockton to launch another shot to beat them. Stockton
cut behind another pick, and the Rockets refused to relive the
heartache of the 1997 Western Conference finals when Stockton hid
behind a screen and nailed a 3-pointer to complete a stunning,
improbable comeback.
<TEXT>
<P>
   This time, Charles Barkley jumped out and cut him off. Stockton
took a step back and drove the lane. Hakeem Olajuwon slid over.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets had let a 15-point fourth-quarter lead slip away
before regaining a one-point edge, but visions of Stockton's
celebration had begun haunting again. The Rockets were all over the
Jazz point guard as the last few seconds ticked away.
</P>
<P>
   This time, instead of shooting, Stockton passed to Karl Malone
to complete a stunning, improbable comeback. All by himself in the
corner, Malone took the pass and swished his jumper with 2.7
seconds left, lifting the Jazz to an 88-87 win Thursday night and
ending the Rockets' winning streak at nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hakeem can't leave Karl Malone, plain and simple,'' Barkley
said. ``We left him open. We're not supposed to leave him. We made
an error on that play.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was what the play was designed to force the Rockets to
do, unless they allowed Stockton an open jumper from the free-throw
line or a pass to Thurl Bailey, who set the pick, near the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what's happening,'' Utah coach Jerry Sloan said
of the position the play put the Rockets in. ``Any time John starts
his penetration, what are you going to give?
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually don't tell what our plays are called, because
they're so secret. Only 29 teams know what that play is.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barkley also said that was not why the Rockets lost their
fifth consecutive regular-season game to the Jazz, which continues
to haunt even beyond the playoff defeats of the Rockets the past
two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets led by 15 with eight minutes left. Even after a 23-5
Jazz run turned the 15-point deficit into a three-point Utah lead,
the Rockets recovered. They regained the lead and had a chance to
take a three-point edge, but an Olajuwon jumper with 13.6 seconds
left was off the mark.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon had 32 points, but that shot from 14 feet out missed.
Malone's didn't. But it was all the shots the Rockets missed after
building their lead that cost them their latest defeat to the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``We blew the game,'' said Barkley, who made just two of 11
shots for nine points. ``We can't blow a lead like that. Dream
carried us, but me and Scottie (Pippen, who had 10) have to help
him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't throw it in the ocean. We couldn't score. I blame
that on myself.''
</P>
<P>
   But though Barkley missed four shots, all on good looks, during
the Jazz run, he was far from alone.
</P>
<P>
   After Othella Harrington had scored on a drive for a 78-63
Rockets lead, the Jazz had to commit to double-team inside and the
Rockets were unable to make them pay. Michael Dickerson, Brent
Price and Pippen missed open 3s, and the Jazz began its comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Price hit a 3, but after a turnover by Olajuwon and two missed
jumpers by Barkley, the Jazz had run to within 81-79, with a 16-3
spurt in four minutes. The Rockets had blown leads to the likes of
the Mavericks, Kings and Raptors. But once on a roll, the Jazz
remains far too polished to waste that sort of chance, no matter
its recent struggles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in many games we had leads, but we always let them
get back in it,'' Olajuwon said. ``This is a lesson. When we have a
team down, we have to put them away.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, the Rockets did not seem to let up too soon,
enjoying their success prematurely. Instead, they missed shots they
would expect to make, then let the Jazz beat them down the court to
get their previously struggling offense going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were in control of the game,'' Rockets coach Rudy
Tomjanovich said. ``You can't ease up on a good team. If you can be
up on somebody, you can stay up on somebody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defense was the big deal. All we have to do is make some
stops. We let this one get away.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after Olajuwon interrupted the Jazz run with 3:45 left, the
Jazz kept coming, finally taking the lead with 1:57 left on a
Shandon Anderson layup off a Stockton pass and pushing the lead to
three on a Malone fast-break layup, also from Stockton.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets had seemed to recover, however. Olajuwon hit a pair
of free throws, then a hook with 45.7 seconds left for an 87-86
lead. But his jumper with 13.6 seconds fell short, and with 8.5
seconds left, the Jazz called time out to set up a last play.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets were left with 2.7 seconds to try to steal the game
back. Tomjanovich put three guards in with Pippen inbounding,
hoping for a pass to at least an open shot.
</P>
<P>
   They got the open shot, but with the guards unable to work free,
Pippen was forced to go to Olajuwon, just inside the 3-point line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good look,'' Olajuwon said of his last shot at the
buzzer. ``I thought I got a clear look. At that point, I just
wanted to get the shot off.''
</P>
<P>
   By that point, it was too late, another big lead lost, the Jazz
running Stockton around another pick to torment the Rockets again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just one more play, one more offensively or one more
defensively, and we get a win,'' Tomjanovich said. ``But we
couldn't do it.''

YEARS OF LOSING UNDER ASSAULT BY HOLMGREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND _ If the NFL were horticulture, the Seahawks would be
on their way to becoming one well-mowed lawn. No weeds, no moss,
all green, all even, all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you have read that the local pro grid unit has its
chinstraps buckled, its jerseys tucked, its penmanship corrected
(no happy face circles over the i's) and its grammar spiffed.
</P>
<P>
   No one is saying exactly how this will translate into dropping
Barry Sanders 4 yards behind the line during the season opener five
months from now. But since Mike Holmgren is insisting upon these
matters, they are being done.
</P>
<P>
   The new coach is Mr. Max Credibility, and when he requires
someone to drop and give him 20, well, even the secretaries and the
janitors are floorbound.
</P>
<P>
   It's not necessarily the stereotypical drill-sergeant approach,
although he's all that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you drop a ball, you'll hear about it, if you miss an
assignment, you'll hear about it,'' said Cortez Kennedy, the
Seahawk defensive dean. ``If I mess up, he's not afraid to get in
my face.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good. I respect the man so much. I've been here 10
years, and he calls me an old guy, but I feel like I'm 21 again
because of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren's assertiveness and his insinuation into the details
are his ways of making inroads into the Seahawk culture of losing.
</P>
<P>
   Probably no one at this week's mini-camp, despite 10
playoff-free years, will acknowledge that there has been such a
thing. Then again, that's what the Packers believed seven years ago
when Holmgren arrived in Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem was they really believed they were playing at a
championship level, that how they were playing was OK,'' Holmgren
said recently.
</P>
<P>
   The attitude wasn't confined to players. It permeated the front
office and all the non-player personnel.
</P>
<P>
   So before his first season, Holmgren invited every Packers
employee _ groundskeepers, video guys, cooks _ to a meeting where
he introduced himself. He explained that each of them had a
contribution to make to reaching the Super Bowl, and they could be
no less diligent about their responsibilities than he or any of his
coaches and players was.
</P>
<P>
   Corny, right? Holmgren had done a little research. It had been
28 years between the last season of Vince Lombardi's legendary
Green Bay career and Holmgren's takeover. Amazingly, 30 employees,
nearly half of the non-playing personnel, had been there the entire
time, a period pickled with mediocrity, coaching staff turnover and
a whole bunch of meaningless ``The Pack is Back'' bumper stickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see it,'' he said Thursday after practice. ``These
people had seen the furniture and the pictures on the wall changed
about every four years, and they looked at me and said, `We'll
still be here when you leave.'''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting began to break the chain of diminished expectations.
Five years and much good football later, the Packers won the Super
Bowl, the franchise was the darling of the American sports world
and Holmgren made sure every employee was in on the traveling party
to the unofficial national holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren makes no claim to the NFL invention of inclusiveness.
He saw Bill Walsh do the same thing when Holmgren was an assistant
coach under Walsh with the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   It helped in San Francisco. It helped in Green Bay. So a few
weeks ago, Holmgren staged a similar kind of pep talk at Seahawk
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get them as fired up as I was,'' Holmgren said.
``They need to know they're an extension of the team on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``A football franchise sometimes is not a healthy environment,
where you're working hard for seven or eight months in a stressful
situation. People need to enjoy being a part of it, being emotional
about wins and losses.''
</P>
<P>
   In the big picture, talking up the staff is a little thing. It's
way early to judge any impact, particularly in Seattle, where a
number of employees are also working for Seahawk owner Paul Allen's
other sports enterprise, the Portland Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   But any effort to reconnect a team that has been on a
decade-long drift from the NFL spotlight, its fan base and even
itself has to be worthwhile. Ending the culture of losing begins to
get done in the offseason one little thing at a time, so that they
are second nature when the ``unhealthy environment'' sets in.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy offered up an example from the football field:
</P>
<P>
   ``When a meeting is supposed to start at 9 a.m., it's 9 a.m.,
not 9:05,'' he said. ``When the meeting is over, we have exactly 15
minutes to get out on the field and practice what we just talked
about in the meeting. Nobody's sitting around for an hour,
hour-and-a-half, forgetting stuff and getting out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   How such things manifest into wins is part of the alchemy of
sports. But if Kennedy says his considerable bag of bones is
feeling 21 again, Holmgren appears to be on to something.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SALT LAKE CITY _ It was a blast from the past. It was just like old
times.
</P>
<P>
   It was a trip down memory lane. Ancient and recent. Good
memories and bad memories.
</P>
<P>
   Hakeem Olajuwon carved up the Jazz like a chainsaw going through
butter, dropping in soft jumpers from the baseline and the wing,
curling down into the lane and spinning around defenders to drop in
his jump hook.
</P>
<P>
   It was a third quarter that might as well been a greatest hits
reel cued up on the VCR. Greg Ostertag couldn't stop him. Todd
Fuller couldn't stop him. The Mormon Tabernacle Choir and the
entire Osmond family couldn't have stopped him.
</P>
<P>
   He scored from here. He scored from there. He grabbed key
rebounds, and he lifted off like one of those Titan rockets at Cape
Canaveral and swatted back two Utah offerings at the basket.
</P>
<P>
   With 7:54 left in the third quarter, Olajuwon took a feed from
Scottie Pippen, turned and stabbed a 13-foot jumper over Ostertag
to become the 12th player in NBA history to cross the 25,000-point
threshold. He wound up with 32 on the night.
</P>
<P>
   Just like the good old days.
</P>
<P>
   But Karl Malone came wide open in the left corner, took a pass
from John Stockton and, with 2.7 seconds left in the game, drilled
a 19-footer of his own and slipped another dagger across the
throats of the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   So it ends 88-87 Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Just like the bad old days.
</P>
<P>
   Utah didn't have an answer for Olajuwon.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets didn't have an answer for the Jazz at crunch time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 25,000th point is something I forgot about by the time the
game ended,'' Olajuwon said. ``It was nice when they stopped the
game and made the announcement. But it would have been so sweet if
we could have held on.''
</P>
<P>
   For yet another night, the center moving toward middle age
showed he is still capable of being most of the things he once was.
</P>
<P>
   For yet another frustrating evening, the Rockets showed that
they are quite capable of building a big, impressive lead and then
letting it slip away like a greased pig.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to get sloppy and let teams like the Clippers
and Mavericks and Nuggets and the rest of the garbage get a flicker
of hope before finally making the winning plays down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   However, when you're playing the likes of the Jazz, a flicker
can quickly become a spark and a spark a raging fire and, before
you know it, everything you worked so hard to build is nothing more
than a pile of ashes.
</P>
<P>
   It was the shooting of Bryon Russell on a 25-point night that
led the Jazz attack. But it was the way the Jazz attacked the
offensive boards and the way the Rockets became soft on defense
that turned the game around.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets led 76-61 when Pippen finished off a fast break with
a layup with 9:05 left in the game. And it was 87-86 when Olajuwon
made his last jump hook over Thurl Bailey with 45.7 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen blocked an inside attempt by Malone. Then Olajuwon missed
a 14-footer from the left side.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz called time, and all those bad memories came rushing
back. Suddenly it was June 1997 and you could feel the sense of
dread in your throat.
</P>
<P>
   Two years too late, the Rockets finally remembered to keep
Stockton covered. But after Bailey set a pick and Charles Barkley
came over to help on Stockton, Olajuwon set his sights on Bailey,
who was cruising toward the hoop.
</P>
<P>
   That left Malone wide open in front of the Jazz bench. He scored
just 16 points on the night, but he wasn't going to miss that one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned my head away,'' said Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich.
``I wasn't going to look. I didn't have to. I listened to the
crowd, and I knew what happened. That guy's a great player. I've
seen him have off nights before and make the big play at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudy T has seen Olajuwon pull the Rockets out of the fire so
many times in so many games, too.
</P>
<P>
   After two timeouts, the best the Rockets could get was an
off-balance shot by Olajuwon from beyond the top of the key. It
never hit the rim.
</P>
<P>
   Gone was the nine-game winning streak. Gone was the chance to
overtake the Jazz in the Midwest Division standings.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe all that came out of it was a painful lesson finally
hammered home with an exclamation point.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times have we lost leads like that?'' Tomjanovich
said. ``I think it's a horrible trait for a team to have. If you
can build a lead, then you can finish the game off. I've been
talking about it, preaching it. Maybe if we learn the lesson,
something good comes from this.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon reflected on the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Records and games are the same,'' he said. ``They happen, and
you move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaving just the memories. The good ones and the bad.

SONIC SLIDE REACHES .500

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ There was no 29-point deficit this time. No slow
starts, frantic comebacks, or Vin Baker aggravating an injury.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's Sonic game against the Denver Nuggets included
just two simple subplots: Revenge and the Sonics' eighth different
starting lineup this season.
</P>
<P>
   Sonics coach Paul Westphal again sent guard Hersey Hawkins to
the bench in favor of Billy Owens. The move came after Hawkins
requested it and Westphal acknowledged a need for the team to
create mismatches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever chemistry means, we seem to have a lot better
chemistry with that lineup than other stuff we've had to try this
year,'' Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, though, ``we were 6-0 with that lineup _
starting with a big two-guard,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Make that 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Despite trying yet another way to jump-start what is left of the
regular season, the Sonics fell 113-110 to the Nuggets at McNichols
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Sonics' second straight loss, and third in four
games. Friday doesn't get any easier when the Sonics complete this
five-games-in-six-nights road trip at Portland.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics (15-15) could conceivably fall below .500 for the
first time this season. They are just 4-11 on the road, and have
not had a sub-par record since the 1990-91 season when the Sonics
were 15-16 after 31 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we can do is keep picking ourselves up off the floor and
come out swinging,'' Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their first meeting here, when the Sonics fell behind by
29 in the first half, they were at least in the game until the end.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics had a chance to tie the game when Antonio McDyess
missed a pair of free throws that could have sealed Denver's win.
However, Dale Ellis' 3-pointer bounced off the rim as the clock
expired.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Detlef Schrempf could have tied the score with 21
seconds left in the game. But Schrempf split two foul shots,
leaving the Sonics with a 109-108 deficit. McDyess made two free
throws seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a decent look,'' Ellis said of his last shot. ``McDyess
jumped out at it and blocked the basket a little bit. ... They play
against us with a great deal of confidence. We didn't have much of
an answer for (Chauncey) Billups and (Nick) Van Exel.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver's starting backcourt smacked 63 points in the Sonics'
mug. Billups finished with a career-high 32 points, including four
3-pointers. Van Exel made six 3-pointers and tallied 31 points.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Payton was the Sonics' biggest retort to the
unconscious-shooting Nuggets. He scored 33 points on 13-of-26
shooting. Owens, who played just 13 minutes, managed just two
points and couldn't keep up with Billups.
</P>
<P>
   So that left a much quicker Hawkins to play 33 minutes off the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shot the ball well, and that's the only reason that they
won,'' Sonics center Olden Polynice said. ``It wasn't about their
defense or anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics did enough to win. They matched the Nuggets with
46-percent shooting. The Sonics won the rebounding battle, 43-31.
They recovered from deficits of seven and eight points in the first
half. The team also roared back from an 11-point deficit in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics just didn't make enough free throws (27-for-37) and
3-pointers (3-for-10). Conversely, Denver missed just six foul
shots. The Nuggets killed the Sonics with rally-thwarting bombs _
mostly tough shots _ from Billups or Van Exel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Billy Owens can't stay with me so I tried to use that
to my advantage,'' Billups said. ``If they start a 6-foot-9
two-guard, they try to use it to their advantage and post me up. So
I try to use my speed and ball-handling abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   By now, you know which scheme worked best.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not going to happen every night,'' said Hawkins, who
volunteered to go to the bench after the Sonics' loss at Detroit
last Sunday. The Sonics will stay with Owens in place of Hawkins.
</P>
<P>
   Without Baker, the Sonics have had a difficult time establishing
a post-up game. Owens and Schrempf should give the team a height
advantage at their respective positions on most nights.
</P>
<P>
   With Hawkins coming off the bench, Schrempf started at small
forward and rookie Vladimir Stepania started at power forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were getting off to such slow starts that I told him if he
feels he needs to do anything to spark the team, then I'd be
willing to come off the bench,'' Hawkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins' 13 points combined with Ellis' 12 and Aaron Williams'
14 gave the Sonics a decided advantage off the bench. The Sonics'
reserves outscored Denver's, 41-9.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when (the Nuggets) make fade-away threes and off-balanced
shots, they're feeling it. Things are just not going for us,''
Schrempf said.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Sonics, that has been the one constant
this season.

YEARS OF LOSING UNDER ASSAULT BY HOLMGREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ If the NFL were horticulture, the Seahawks
would be on their way to becoming one well-mowed lawn. No weeds, no
moss, all green, all even, all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you have read that the local pro grid unit has its
chinstraps buckled, its jerseys tucked, its penmanship corrected
(no happy face circles over the i's) and its grammar spiffed.
</P>
<P>
   No one is saying exactly how this will translate into dropping
Barry Sanders 4 yards behind the line during the season opener five
months from now. But since Mike Holmgren is insisting upon these
matters, they are being done.
</P>
<P>
   The new coach is Mr. Max Credibility, and when he requires
someone to drop and give him 20, well, even the secretaries and the
janitors are floorbound.
</P>
<P>
   It's not necessarily the stereotypical drill-sergeant approach,
although he's all that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you drop a ball, you'll hear about it, if you miss an
assignment, you'll hear about it,'' said Cortez Kennedy, the
Seahawk defensive dean. ``If I mess up, he's not afraid to get in
my face.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good. I respect the man so much. I've been here 10
years, and he calls me an old guy, but I feel like I'm 21 again
because of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren's assertiveness and his insinuation into the details
are his ways of making inroads into the Seahawk culture of losing.
</P>
<P>
   Probably no one at this week's mini-camp, despite 10
playoff-free years, will acknowledge that there has been such a
thing. Then again, that's what the Packers believed seven years ago
when Holmgren arrived in Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem was they really believed they were playing at a
championship level, that how they were playing was OK,'' Holmgren
said recently.
</P>
<P>
   The attitude wasn't confined to players. It permeated the front
office and all the non-player personnel.
</P>
<P>
   So before his first season, Holmgren invited every Packers
employee _ groundskeepers, video guys, cooks _ to a meeting where
he introduced himself. He explained that each of them had a
contribution to make to reaching the Super Bowl, and they could be
no less diligent about their responsibilities than he or any of his
coaches and players was.
</P>
<P>
   Corny, right? Holmgren had done a little research. It had been
28 years between the last season of Vince Lombardi's legendary
Green Bay career and Holmgren's takeover. Amazingly, 30 employees,
nearly half of the non-playing personnel, had been there the entire
time, a period pickled with mediocrity, coaching staff turnover and
a whole bunch of meaningless ``The Pack is Back'' bumper stickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see it,'' he said Thursday after practice. ``These
people had seen the furniture and the pictures on the wall changed
about every four years, and they looked at me and said, `We'll
still be here when you leave.'''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting began to break the chain of diminished expectations.
Five years and much good football later, the Packers won the Super
Bowl, the franchise was the darling of the American sports world
and Holmgren made sure every employee was in on the traveling party
to the unofficial national holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren makes no claim to the NFL invention of inclusiveness.
He saw Bill Walsh do the same thing when Holmgren was an assistant
coach under Walsh with the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   It helped in San Francisco. It helped in Green Bay. So a few
weeks ago, Holmgren staged a similar kind of pep talk at Seahawk
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get them as fired up as I was,'' Holmgren said.
``They need to know they're an extension of the team on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``A football franchise sometimes is not a healthy environment,
where you're working hard for seven or eight months in a stressful
situation. People need to enjoy being a part of it, being emotional
about wins and losses.''
</P>
<P>
   In the big picture, talking up the staff is a little thing. It's
way early to judge any impact, particularly in Seattle, where a
number of employees are also working for Seahawk owner Paul Allen's
other sports enterprise, the Portland Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   But any effort to reconnect a team that has been on a
decade-long drift from the NFL spotlight, its fan base and even
itself has to be worthwhile. Ending the culture of losing begins to
get done in the offseason one little thing at a time, so that they
are second nature when the ``unhealthy environment'' sets in.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy offered up an example from the football field:
</P>
<P>
   ``When a meeting is supposed to start at 9 a.m., it's 9 a.m.,
not 9:05,'' he said. ``When the meeting is over, we have exactly 15
minutes to get out on the field and practice what we just talked
about in the meeting. Nobody's sitting around for an hour,
hour-and-a-half, forgetting stuff and getting out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   How such things manifest into wins is part of the alchemy of
sports. But if Kennedy says his considerable bag of bones is
feeling 21 again, Holmgren appears to be on to something.

 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ For the first 20 minutes Thursday &UR;  &LR; night, the Bruins
looked sloppy, lethargic, and woefully out of sync. For the first
20 minutes, it was impossible to tell which team was playing for
jobs and pride and which was fighting for a postseason berth.
</P>
<P>
   For the first 20 minutes, coach Pat Burns looked as if he wanted
to spit tacks. After the Bruins surrendered two goals in the final
half-minute of the first period to fall behind, 2-0, Burns vented
his frustration at his players during intermission.
</P>
<P>
   The result? A 3-2 Boston victory over the Canadiens at the
Molson Centre that coupled with a Florida loss to Washington moves
the Bruins seven points ahead of the Panthers and idle Rangers with
eight games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were awful,'' said Burns. ``We were playing like we
finished the last couple of games. We didn't really get into their
faces, we weren't physical so we had to remind some guys about how
we should be playing and now how we were playing. I thought we
bounced back in the second and third periods.''
</P>
<P>
   The win ended the club's winless streak at three games (0-1-2).
</P>
<P>
   Steve Heinze and Anson Carter each notched a goal and an assist
and center Jason Allison, who has been hampered by a sore wrist,
had a pair of assists.
</P>
<P>
   Allison set up the winning goal by Carter at 8:48 of the third.
He dished a pass from the right circle to Heinze in the slot.
Heinze backhanded it toward the net, goalie Jeff Hackett tried to
grab it with his glove and missed, and Carter tapped it in from the
edge of the crease.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, who weren't playing well early, thought they were in
good shape until late in the first. But the Canadiens scored 17
seconds apart to take a 2-0 lead. The problems started with 27.2
seconds left. Left wing Brian Savage teed up a slapper from the
right point that goalie Byron Dafoe stopped with his right pad.
Defenseman Grant Ledyard tried to clear away the rebound but it
bounced off center Sergei Zholtok. Both Dafoe and defenseman
Mattias Timander scrambled to get the puck out but right wing
Dainius Zubrus scampered down the right side and backhanded the
puck into the net at 19:32.
</P>
<P>
   The second goal came on as strange a play as you'll see.
Montreal's Turner Stevenson fired a long lead pass that glanced off
the stick of Bruins center Tim Taylor, who was trying to block the
feed. The puck bounced behind Ray Bourque and wound up right on the
stick of Savage, who charged in on Dafoe. Dafoe came way out of his
net, but Savage beat him to the puck and buried it into the empty
cage with 10.5 seconds left. Hackett was credited with an assist,
the first by a Canadiens netminder at home since Patrick Roy got
one April 17, 1995, in a 5-2 victory over Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burnsie gave it to us good and deservedly so,'' said Dafoe of
his coach's tirade between periods 1 and 2. ``We were sluggish
again and just not a very good effort by all of us in the first.
But responded great. I have full confidence we were coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins redeemed themselves in the middle period as they
fought back to tie it, 2-2, on goals by Heinze and Joe Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   Boston got on the board with a power-play goal at 2:59. Bourque
teed up a shot from the left point, and with Allison running
interference in front of the net, Heinze crashed in for the rebound
and beat Hackett for his 21st goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Both clubs tried to get something going with a couple of
skirmishes. First it was Montreal defenseman Igor Ulanov going with
Bruins right wing Rob DiMaio, who gave up several inches and many
pounds but still held his own. Ken Belanger and Dave Morissette
also squared off but only briefly.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton pulled Boston even with 1:36 left in the period,
scoring his 14th of the season. Defenseman Kyle McLaren dished the
puck up through neutral ice to Carter, who gained the blue line and
fed the puck into the right circle for Thornton. Thornton lured
Hackett out, but the goalie blocked him. Thornton maintained
control, moved along the edge of the crease from right to left, and
fired it into the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heinzie's goal was the big lift we needed and then two great
bouts by DiMaio and Belanger lifted the whole bench,'' said Dafoe,
who stopped 22 shots. ``Joe has been getting some big goals for us
this year and that was one of the biggest ones. We knew we were
going to come back in this game. We had a lot of confidence, even
though we played as bad as we did in the first.''

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It's a first.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday evening, the University of New Hampshire will play for
the NCAA Division 1 hockey championship for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats knocked off Michigan State, 5-3, Thursday &UR;  &LR; night at
Arrowhead Pond to earn a spot against Maine in an all-Hockey East
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Four times, UNH had been to the national semifinals. And four
times, most recently last year when they lost to Michigan, 4-0, at
the FleetCenter, the Wildcats had failed to make the final.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just hitting me,'' said UNH coach Dick Umile.
``We're excited. We didn't play well in the second period and
(goaltender) Ty (Conklin) kept us in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Score this one for the scorers.
</P>
<P>
   UNH unleashed its powerful top line on Michigan State. And the
Spartans, who had the best defensive team the country has seen in
years, could not handle it.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Souza, a junior out of Wakefield, Mass., led the way with
two goals and two assists. Jason Krog had a pair of goals and
assisted on the winning goal by Jason Shipulski. And freshman
Darren Haydar, the linemate of Souza and Krog, had two assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a real quick team and we're able to capitalize on
poking the puck by defensemen once in a while,'' Souza said.
</P>
<P>
   UNH improved its record, already the best in school history, to
31-6-3. Michigan State closes out at 29-6-7.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats and Black Bears have split four games this year.
UNH won the two most recent meetings, 6-1 and 4-1, at Durham, N.H.,
on the last weekend of the regular season. Saturday's game (7:30
p.m., ESPN) is the mother of all rubber matches.
</P>
<P>
   Shipulski converted a perfect lead pass from Krog to put UNH up,
4-3, with 9:08 to play. Krog feathered a backhand across to a
streaking Shipulski. Souza also assisted.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats put the Spartans away with a power-play goal four
minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   They were just nine seconds into the man advantage when Krog
scored on a rebound, Haydar and Souza assisting, and it was 5-3
with 5:20 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to that, UNH had taken the lead three times only to see
the Spartans tie it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we wore them out,'' Souza said. ``We'd get a
goal, they'd get one. It kind of went back and forth like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Krog opened the scoring with 1:11 left in the first period. And
38 seconds later, Rustyn Dolyny tied it.
</P>
<P>
   Souza scored his first when he put a shot through the legs of
goalie Joe Blackburn and the puck barely made it across the line to
make it 2-1 at 2:44 of the second.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Patchell got that one back just more than four minutes
later.
</P>
<P>
   It stayed tied, with Michigan State taking the play to UNH,
through most of the period.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with 1:43 left in the period, Souza scored again, stealing
a defenseman's pass in the MSU end and making a nice move to get in
alone on Blackburn. The goalie made the first stop, but Souza beat
him with the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Conklin had 17 saves (and 32 for the game) and UNH got out of
the period up, 3-2. But the Spartans soon tied it again.
</P>
<P>
   Mike York sent a nice pass in from the sideboards to set up Adam
Hall in front to make it 3-3 at 3:44 of the third.
</P>
<P>
   UNH had a couple of chances to stretch its lead to two early in
the third, but could not convert on a pair of breakaways. Johnny
Rogers had the first and Blackburn stopped him. Blackburn then got
a leg on a Krog shot.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at 3-3 with Michigan State on the power play, Krog
stripped the puck from a defender and came in on Blackburn again
and ripped a shot that the goalie gloved.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, with Shipulski's linemates changing up,
Krog sent the junior from Saugus in for the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Umile was not surprised that the Spartans kept coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't expect to run people out of a game at this point,''
he said. ``Not with the teams we're playing. You just go back and
forth and give yourself a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor was he surprised the game turned into a bit of a shootout.
Besides a great defense _ they had given up 1.44 goals per game and
only once had yielded five _ the Spartans have an underrated
offense, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it couldn't keep up with his Thursday &UR;  &LR; night.

SOUZA MAKES POINT

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Two juniors from communities a tad north of
Boston played vital roles in New Hampshire's first win in five
trips to the national semifinals Thursday &UR;  &LR; night at Arrowhead Pond.
They were Wakefield's Mike Souza (two goals, two assists) and
Saugus's Jason Shipulski, who gave his team the lead for good.
</P>
<P>
   Souza was a one-man wrecking crew. He scored his 21st goal at
2:44 of the second period, clicked for his 22d at 18:47 when he
rammed home his own rebound, and assisted on Shipulski's winner at
10:52 of the third. He picked up his second assist on the insurance
goal by Jason Krog.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Hobey Baker finalist Krog also made a contribution,
scoring his 33d and 34th goals of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike's a threat to pick up a point every minute he's on the
ice,'' said UNH coach Dick Umile. ``He's been a steady force all
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the soft hands you like to see on a playmaker. Face it,
you don't score 22 goals and pick up 41 assists being lucky. Mike's
a hard-nosed player who goes all out every shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't have a great player like Jason Krog, Mike would
be our Hobey Baker candidate. He's on the power play, he kills
penalties, and he sees every inch of the ice all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Producing points is a Souza trademark. While playing for Dave
McCarthy at Wakefield High, he recorded 206 points, a Middlesex
League record. He was a Middlesex All-Star four times and a Globe
All-Scholastic.
</P>
<P>
   Souza downplayed his accomplishment, instead praising teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just played hockey like Coach Umile told us to do,'' said
Souza. ``We are a quick team and we took advantage of that. We
forechecked well and we got some odd-man rushes and maybe stopped
them from getting odd-man rushes.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the go-ahead goal, Souza said, ``Jason (Krog) made a great
pass and Jason (Shipulski) reacted quickly and put it away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, I am excited where we are. I'm on a great line, but
if our line doesn't score goals, we know the other lines are
capable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did celebrate the win on the ice after the game, but we
were quiet in the dressing room. We have another game to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Shipulski said, ``We just went at them like we were told to do.
I think we wore them down without forechecking.''
</P>
<P>
   Souza didn't want to talk about himself. He said, ``Every game
we play is a big game and maybe our toughest game. UNH is a solid
program and every team gets up for us. We expect that. So Michigan
State was our toughest game so far. But we all know that Maine will
be our toughest game.''

STEWART'S OT GOAL LIFTS MAINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MONAHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ University of Maine hockey coach Shawn Walsh
had been acting like a Mississippi gambler the past week. He held
his cards close to his vest and talked about things his team might
do differently. He had a handful of cards _ all high ones _ and he
played them like the dealer with the visor, suspenders, and cigar.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a heart-throbbing 2-1 victory over Boston College
on Bobby Stewart's overtime goal Thursday &UR;  &LR; night in the national
semifinals of the Frozen Four at Arrowhead Pond before 12,582.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh dealt himself a straight flush and Boston College two pair
as the Black Bears advanced to Saturday's final and a shot at its
second national title.
</P>
<P>
   This encounter also was a bitter fight between two contestants
who were 180 feet apart. Maine goalie Alfie Michaud and BC goalie
Scott Clemmensen each made 35 saves. Both played winning hockey,
but only one could advance.
</P>
<P>
   It also was the pairing of two heavyweight coaches and two
heavyweight teams. Forget they were 2-2 in four early meetings this
season. It was the rubber game for lots of marbles.
</P>
<P>
   BC coach Jerry York won an NCAA championship with Bowling Green
in 1984. Walsh won a title in 1993 with his Black Bears. They knew
what had to be done. Both teams were fine-tuned and healthy and
sharp. Great matchup. Great game. Great ending for the winner.
Tears for the loser.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh was going to change his power play two weeks ago before
his Black Bears lost to BC in the Hockey East championship, 3-2. He
didn't. He did it a few days later and his troops KO'd Ohio State,
4-2, and Clarkson, 7-2.
</P>
<P>
   Then Walsh said, ``We'll do some things against BC but I'll keep
them in the locker room for now.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday Walsh's power play was a woeful 0 for 7 and BC was 1
for 6.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh's magic?
</P>
<P>
   It was there.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh had a sort of unsung kid from Somerville named Niko
Dimitrakos who, as a freshman right wing on the third line, tied
the game at 2:34 of the third period, then had the Maine fans in a
frenzy in overtime as he held the puck for a seeming eternity,
making a three-quarters loop through the zone before he backhanded
a pass to the front of the net that Barrett Heisten deflected to
Stewart, who scored the winner at 5:16 of the extra period.
</P>
<P>
   BC knew Hobey Baker finalist Steve Kariya (6 points last
Saturday against Clarkson) was a key. Kariya wasn't the main
factor. Dimitrakos, a Matignon grad, was.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal was good teamwork,'' said Dimitrakos. ``On the
overtime goal I just kept possession and circled. I wasn't worried.
I saw Bobby break for the net and waited. I just sent him a flip
pass and it just grazed Barrett Heisten's stick before Bobby got
it. He put it away nicely.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, one of Maine's five seniors who couldn't vie for
college hockey's Holy Grail the past three seasons because of NCAA
sanctions, beamed. ``It was a perfect pass. Niko is one of the
smartest players on the team. I knew he'd see me. Clemmensen went
down and I went high shelf.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said, ``Niko is one of the most talented offensive players
in our league. I love to have him on the ice. He's a kid I wanted
on my team since I saw him playing for Matignon High School.''
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the first period, Maine's Brendan Walsh of
Dorchester took a hit from BC's Andy Powers of Arlington and Walsh
left with an injured knee. Sixth defenseman A.J. Begg took Walsh's
spot as second-line center.
</P>
<P>
   (Shawn) Walsh said, ``Begg didn't work out all that great. So
from the second period on, I double-shifted Niko and Steve Kariya
and they did very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Maine drew three penalties in a row in the second period:
Matthias Trattnig for interference at 1:02; Heisten for
interference at 3:01, and Doug Janik for hooking at 4:10.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Bears killed the first two and the BC power play was
successful at 5:34 when sophomore defenseman Marty Hughes of
Lawrence Academy scored his third goal of the season from 35 feet
to the right side of Michaud.
</P>
<P>
   Dimitrakos tied it, 1-1, at 2:34 of the third when he collected
a nifty pass out from Ben Guite and whipped home a high 25-footer
to the left side. It was his seventh goal and 25th point.
</P>
<P>
   Maine outshot BC, 12-8, in the nail-biting third period. BC
killed three penalties and Maine two.
</P>
<P>
   That set the stage for the fourth period.

A FABULOUS FLIGHT FOR FALLEN EAGLES 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ For players like Chris Masters and Brendan
Buckley, it ended where it all began. The best part is that it
ended with dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointing? Oh, absolutely. Losing in the semifinals of any
national championship competition is always disappointing. It is
now scant consolation, but some day these BC warhorses can tell
their progeny that they were defeated in the first NCAA hockey game
ever played under the official designation of ``Frozen Four.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now the BC players are dealing with the fact that it will
be Hockey East rival Maine, and not them, who will be playing for
the big prize Saturday evening. The Eagles could not build on a 1-0
two-period lead and finally lost the game when Bobby Stewart took a
feed from Somerville's Niko Dimitrakos and put it high on Scott
Clemmensen's glove side to give the Black Bears a 2-1 overtime
victory at the Arrowhead Pond.
</P>
<P>
   The Arrowhead Pond is a certifiably strange place for a Boston
College hockey player to conclude his collegiate hockey career, but
that's not the half of it. This also happens to be where seven BC
seniors, Masters and Buckley among them, began their careers in
something called the Great Western Freeze-Out in October 1995.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a pleasant visit. Michigan State beat the Eagles,
5-2, the first night and Miami of Ohio blasted them, 7-1 the next
night. And Wally Szczerbiak didn't even play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I brought a team here four years ago and we got waxed,'' said
coach Jerry York. ``I remember the 7-1 game. But if you saw that
team play, and this team play, boy . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   A lot has happened to the Boston College hockey program in those
four years, and most of it has been good. Last year BC had a great
year from start to finish and wound up losing an overtime contest
to Michigan in the national final, the game hailed by no less an
authority than Wolverine coach Red Berenson as ``the best college
hockey game I've ever seen.'' This year BC suffered through a
112-day period in which its record was a mediocre 15-11-4 before
putting together one of the great stretches of concentrated two-way
hockey in the 81-year history of the program.
</P>
<P>
   What BC did to get itself here was phenomenal. ``We knocked off
the Nos. 3, 2, and 1 teams in the country,'' reminded Masters, an
assistant captain. BC wasn't supposed to win the Hockey East
tournament by defeating Maine and New Hampshire. BC certainly
wasn't supposed to defeat Northern Michigan one night and the
mighty Fighting Sioux of North Dakota the next night, especially
after being exiled to Madison, Wis., for the West Regionals. The
totality of BC's eight-game winning streak just to get to the
position it found itself in with 20 minutes remaining in Thursday's
game represents the artistic highlight of the entire Jerry York
regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question,'' agreed the mentor. ``We've never played better
than in those games.''
</P>
<P>
   Any 2-1 game is, by definition, winnable, and this one was no
exception. Nothing happened in this game that anyone who has
witnessed even a little hockey hasn't seen before. Good goaltending
has an inordinate amount of influence in postseason hockey games,
and the fact is that BC had legitimate chances to go up by a 2-0 or
even a 3-0 margin and could not do so because Maine goaltender
Alfie Michaud would not let them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some great opportunities,'' said York. ``But if you
want to win a game like this you have to finish. We definitely had
enough chances in that second period to score some goals.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no need to reinvent the hockey wheel. This game yielded
no great mysteries. These teams have no secrets from each other.
This was, after all, the fifth time they have played this season.
Coming into the game, they were tied at 2-2. Coming out they are
tied with 16 goals apiece. Could it be they are sick of looking at
each other? Would Jerry York have preferred playing somone else
Thursday?
</P>
<P>
   No, he wouldn't. He is Jerry York. He dosn't ever whine or make
excuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe if this were the regionals, we'd like to play someone we
haven't seen before,'' he explained, ``but when you get this far
you kind of expect to see someone you know, given the strength of
our league.''
</P>
<P>
   They played and they lost. That's about it. Jerry York even
found time to praise referee Mike Schmidt for calling a
sensationally fair-minded and intelligent game.
</P>
<P>
   Each season brings something different for a coach to experience
and this year York had the satisfaction of seeing a team figure
something out with enough time left in the season to get dramatic
results from this new-found knowledge. ``In the middle of the
season we just weren't playing good, sound position hockey,'' York
explained. ``We were out of whack. We didn't have a good balance
between defense and offense.''
</P>
<P>
   After a 5-2 loss to Merrimack on Feb. 26, BC found itself. The
Eagles took care of archrival BU and that started an eight-game
joyride during which they kept playing one smart, aggressive, and
spirited game after another. It carried through into the third
period Thursday before Maine, now 30-6-4, demonstrated its own
class on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We competed hard,'' said York. ``Technically, we were solid,
and emotionally we competed very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The program is in very good shape, and always will be as long as
Jerry York is in charge. ``BC is an outstanding team,'' said Maine
coach Shawn Walsh. ``There are a lot of guys on that team who are
going to play in the National Hockey League, and other leagues
beyond college.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here playing great hockey,'' said Buckley, the team
captain. ``It was the best we had played all year, and we had
confidence going into the OT we would get the game-winner. But we
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What a transformation from when I was a freshman to where we
are now,'' marveled Masters. ``It's been two straight Final Fours
for BC, and the best is yet to come.''
</P>
<P>
   BC lost to a great team, period. BC didn't do anything stupid.
BC just got beat. Jerry York can live with that, because, as
everyone knows, he will be back to more Frozen Fours.

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ So what would be the opposite of an Unsung
Hero? A Most Sung Hero? A Heralded Hero?
</P>
<P>
   Pick the label and Maine goalie Alfie Michaud wore it Thursday,
putting up 35 saves and keeping his team in the game long enough
for the Black Bears to catch and then pass Boston College on the
way to a 2-1 overtime win Thursday in the NCAA semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   It was Wednesday afternoon and the Frozen Four teams had
finished their practices. The coaches were having a press
conference and each was asked to name their unsung hero _ the guy
who does the most without getting much recognition. Maine coach
Shawn Walsh wasted no time in mentioning Michaud, his junior
goalie.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Michaud stepped up and grabbed the spotlight. Oh,
he'll have to share it, of course, with Bobby Stewart, who had the
winning goal in overtime, and Niko Dimitrakos, who had a goal and
set up Stewart's winner.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake, Michaud was a most deserving hero in this
one.
</P>
<P>
   A win and a berth in Saturday's NCAA championship game in hand,
Walsh reiterated the Michaud theme Thursday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got no votes for the all-league team,'' Walsh said. ``Not
one. And look what he's done. He's so steady. But he doesn't make
flashy saves.''
</P>
<P>
   They were flashy enough Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   There were a bunch when the Eagles led, 1-0, and were looking
for 2-0, which just might have been enough to put the Black Bears
away. There were a couple in the middle of the second period, first
on Andy Powers, sent in by a great pass from Brian Gionta. There
was one a minute later with Ales Dolinar in close. There was
another on Dolinar later in the period.
</P>
<P>
   And then, early in the third period, with BC on the power play
and still up, 1-0, Gionta was lying on the ice and with a great
effort got a good shot on net.
</P>
<P>
   Michaud was there.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big save,'' Walsh said. ``He was in position.''
</P>
<P>
   Michaud was not much interested in differentiating between
saves.
</P>
<P>
   A save, the message was, is a save.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all stops, it doesn't matter how you do it,'' the
goalie said. ``Ask any goalie, it doesn't matter, you just want to
stop it. You watch Dominic Hasek, he's unbelievable, but nobody
knows his style. And Patrick Roy, he's a technician. I just stop
the puck. It's all a blur for me.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all about thinking for the moment, he said. Actually, the
second.
</P>
<P>
   It's a theory he picked up reading about Roy. And listening to
Maine assistant coach Grant Standbrook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love reading stuff about goalies,'' Michaud said. ``Patrick
Roy talks about getting ready for the moment. You can't worry about
the past. You can't worry about the future. All year long all I've
worried about is the exact second.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a concept he's been employing for about a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried to limit the hills and valleys and make myself more
consistent,'' he said. ``It can be a roller coaster ride. I've been
more consistent so far this year.''

   Michaud is 27-6-3 this year. He lowered his goals-against
average of 2.39 and raised his save percentage of .904 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a typical Alfie Michaud game,'' Walsh said. ``He
didn't make any saves that were unbelievably spectacular, except
maybe the glove save (on Mike Lephart in the third period).
Everything hit him. He is as good a positional goalie as we have
ever had, and maybe that's why he doesn't get the accolades that
other goalies have gotten. He makes it look pretty simple.''

HAROLD GREENWALD, 88, EXPERT ON PSYCHOLOGY OF PROSTITUTES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harold Greenwald, a psychotherapist whose doctoral dissertation
on the psychology of prostitutes evolved into a best-selling 1958
book, ``The Call Girl,'' and a Hollywood movie, ``Girl of the
Night,'' died on Friday at his home in Santa Monica, Calif. He was
88.
</P>
<P>
   Though Greenwald was best known by the general public for his
studies of prostitutes, his reputation among psychologists stemmed
largely from his development of direct decision therapy, an
offshoot of rational emotive behavior therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he founded was the opposite of psychoanalysis, which is
what he started in,'' said Albert Ellis, the Manhattan psychologist
who developed rational emotive behavior therapy. ``He said you make
a decision to upset yourself; you don't get upset bcause of
something that happened in your childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenwald was born on July 28, 1910, in New York City. After
graduating from the City College of New York in 1933, he worked for
the city housing authority and the city planning board. During
World War II, he was a civilian instructor for the Army Air Forces.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, while in his mid-40's, Greenwald earned a doctorate
from Columbia University. Despite his late start, he quickly gained
prominence in psychoanalytic circles as a leading student of the
Freud disciple Theodore Reik. He became president of the
Freudian-leaning National Psychological Association for
Psychoanalysis early in his career.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenwald's voluble, outgoing personality did not lend
itself to long sessions of quiet listening, so he developed direct
decision therapy. In his new view, decisions were the key to
understanding personality and dysfunctional patterns. The
individual, he believed, was free to change decisions throughout
life. Even happiness, he argued, could be made as a decision in
life.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwald wrote numerous books during his career, including
``Great Cases in Psychoanalysis'' (1969), ``Emotional Maturity in
Love and Marriage,'' with Lucy Freeman (1961), ``The Sex-Life
Letters,'' with his wife, Ruth Greenwald, (1972), ``Active
Psychotherapy'' (1974), ``Direct Decision Therapy'' (1974) and
``The Happy Person'' (1984).
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, Greenwald became famous upon the publication of his
first book, ``The Call Girl: A Social and Analytic Study''
(Ballentine), which began as his doctoral dissertation and was
later reissued as ``The Elegant Prostitute.'' The book sold more
than 1 million copies and was translated into seven languages. In
1960, the book was also the basis for the film, ``Girl of the
Night,'' starring Anne Francis and Lloyd Nolan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book was an academic book,'' Ellis said, ``but it sold
mainly because of the stories it told about prostitutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenwald's research, which consisted of interviews with 16
prostitutes, six of whom were in analysis with him and 10 who were
interviewed by three of the women in analysis, humanized the women
and explained why they chose to work as prostitutes. Most, he
wrote, came from unhappy childhoods and felt little love from
either parent.
</P>
<P>
   And, according to an article in Time magazine in 1958 about one
of his books, most prostitutes also had a variety of defense
mechanisms, from self-abasement (masochism) to denial (saying it
was not sex they were having with clients) to projection (saying
other women would barter sex for money if they were not so
inhibited) and reaction formation (acting overly heterosexual when
they were homosexual, or overly aggressive when they were actually
passive).
</P>
<P>
   The book helped to make Greenwald a popular speaker, drawing
standing-room-only crowds at the height of his career at American
Psychological Association presentations and workshops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of mildly embarrassing having your father being an
expert on prostitution,'' said Greenwald's son, David, who lives in
Carversville, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwald taught at Hofstra University, in 1968 and 1969, and at
the University of Bergen in Norway as a Visiting Fulbright Fellow.
He also taught at U.S. International University in San Diego and
became a distinguished professor there in 1975. He served as
president of the Academy of Psychologists in Marital and Family
Therapy and as president of the division of Humanistic Psychology
of the American Psychological Association.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwald's wife preceded him in death.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his son David, Greenwald is survived by a brother,
Michael Kidd of Los Angeles; another son, Robert, of Los Angeles,
and six grandchildren.

IN SURPRISE MOVE, GOTTI ASKS JUDGE TO END HOUSE ARREST AND RETURN
HIM TO JAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ Six months after he won a hard-fought
battle to be released on bail for $10 million, John A. Gotti
stunned a federal courtroom Thursday when he asked a judge to put
him back behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Why he did so, though, remained a mystery in a case already
bubbling with intrigue and surprising plot twists.
</P>
<P>
   Was it because Gotti could not afford the quotidian expenses of
a man who has to pay for the measures required to be under strict
house arrest? Was it because Gotti, confined to his home on New
York's Long Island, simply tired of living a restrictive life that
allowed him no unapproved visitors?
</P>
<P>
   Was it a signal of a plea deal or some kind of calculated move
to impress the judge on the eve of his much-anticipated trial on
federal racketeering charges?
</P>
<P>
   It was a question that Gotti did not seem eager to answer
Thursday. When his lawyer, Gerald L. Shargel, started to tell the
judge, ``He can no longer afford _ _,'' Gotti cut him off abruptly,
saying, ``Never mind, never mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, or reasons, the move jarred what had been a
routine pretrial hearing about jury selection procedures Thursday
in U.S. District Court here. And since there were no objections
from the U.S. attorney's office, Judge Barrington D. Parker Jr.
granted the request.
</P>
<P>
   So on Tuesday morning, the same day that hundreds of prospective
jurors will arrive here for jury selection, Gotti will leave his
wife and four children at home in Oyster Bay on Long Island and
surrender here to federal marshals.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti's move was particularly perplexing given the fact that
last fall he had to persuade two dozen friends and relatives to put
up their homes and businesses to secure his $10 million bail and
then wait as federal officials scrutinized each property to insure
that not one penny of that $10 million was tainted by organized
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti, 35, was indicted in January 1998 and accused of acting as
the head of the Gambino crime family since 1992, when his father,
John J., was sent to prison after being convicted of murder. That
indictment named 22 other men as being Gambino associates, but only
five of them remain on the indictment. The others have all pleaded
guilty to drastically reduced charges.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti, known as Junior, was first held at Westchester County
Jail in Valhalla. But he was released on bail in October, under
carefully monitored conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Confined to his house in Oyster Bay, Gotti has been wearing an
electronic ankle bracelet that tracks his movements. His calls are
monitored, and he has to pay about $24,000 a month for security
guards, posted outside his house.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In December, Gotti's lawyers sought unsuccessfully to ease his
bail conditions and regain assets, complaining to Parker that
Gotti's wallet was being unfairly pinched. Coming in was $11,000 a
month, mainly from autos parts and vending machine companies that
Gotti partly owns; going out, however, was $11,000 for mortgage
payments in Oyster Bay and Massapequa, N.Y., and property in the
Poconos in Pennsylvania; $1,600 for groceries; $1,100 for
utilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's broke,'' a lawyer for Gotti, Sarita Kedia, said at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Asked after Thursday's pretrial hearing to explain what had
happened, the normally loquacious Shargel said only: ``There's
nothing to say. There's no need for an explanation. I did what my
client wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   He did say, however, that the request was most unusual, and one
that neither he nor two of Gotti's other lawyers _ Bruce Cutler and
Ms. Kedia _ had ever done, or had even heard of being done, before.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti, meanwhile, said nothing at first as he left the
courthouse, surrounded by his lawyers and supporters. He smiled
faintly before telling trailing reporters that he had no comment,
and that even if he did, ``you're going to twist it anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   And Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney for the
Southern District of New York, said that his office would have no
comment on the latest developments _ a response echoed by Parker's
office and the pretrial services department of the federal
courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while Gotti's lawyers implied that it was primarily a
financial decision, some former and current FBI agents said the
decision might be a sign that Gotti was considering a last-minute
guilty plea.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Gotti rejected a government offer of about six
years in prison in return for a plea to reduced charges. If he is
convicted of racketeering at a trial, he faces a 20-year prison
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Shargel and Cutler declined to comment on the possibility of a
plea. But they added: ``We are gearing up for the fight of our
lives. It has always been our position to fight and we are not
retreating. This was a personal decision by John to reinstate the
order of detention are we are not going into the reasons.''

CAN AMERICANS GIVE MORE, AND NOT HURT?

 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five years ago, Claude Rosenberg, a retired San Francisco
investment manager, began touring the country, telling Americans
that they could easily double their annual giving to churches and
charities without lowering their standard of living, or their
wealth, one iota.
</P>
<P>
   It was a controversial message, embraced by people like Ted
Turner, who pledged a billion dollars to the United Nations, and
ridiculed by others, who took comfort in the oft-repeated
observation by professional fund-raisers that Americans are the
most generous people in the world.
</P>
<P>
   After all, living Americans gave away either $109 billion or
$115 billion in 1997, depending on whose estimate is used, or about
$1 of every $40 of adjusted gross income.
</P>
<P>
   Now Rosenberg has updated his figures. Because of the booming
stock market, he says, Americans over all could nearly triple their
annual giving without reducing the quality of their life styles.
</P>
<P>
   Americans will give about $132 billion to churches and charities
this year, several studies indicate. Rosenberg said Americans have
the capacity to give an additional $242 billion, for a potential
total of $374 billion in gifts, money that he said would provide
enormous societal gain with no individual pain.
</P>
<P>
   Using income tax data for 1996, the latest year for which
information is available, Rosenberg calculated that a couple with
$50,000 to $74,999 of income, and investment assets of $118,000 _
the average for that group _ could afford to increase donations by
21 percent. That would raise their giving to $1,600, from the
$1,322 average shown in IRS data.
</P>
<P>
   A family with earnings of $100,000, and with $1 million of
invested assets, could give away $16,000 without curtailing their
life style, his economic model showed, which is about six times
actual average giving.
</P>
<P>
   And the roughly 111,000 families with annual incomes of more
than $1 million could increase their yearly giving more than
tenfold without cutting back their life style now or ever,
Rosenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   That group had average adjusted gross income of $2.8 million and
financial assets of $21.2 million, Rosenberg estimated. Based on
those figures, he said, they could give an average of $1.2 million
a year, versus their actual average of $119,830 that year.
</P>
<P>
   In his calculations for that group, Rosenberg used IRS data for
1996 on dividend and interest income to estimate average financial
assets.
</P>
<P>
   But how could a tripling of donations, not to mention a tenfold
increase, not hurt a family? Because, he said, advisers urge
wealthy people to hold down taxable income while still financing
the life style they want, a policy Rosenberg said shortchanges
charity because assets are not considered.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg's message: Change how you look at your capacity to
give, focusing on what you have instead of what you make.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main point,'' Rosenberg said, ``is that generosity has
been based too much on income. With capital for many people being
so much larger than income there is enormous untapped capacity to
give.''
</P>
<P>
   Many charitable endowments operate on the theory that they can
give away roughly 5 percent of assets each year, forever, and keep
pace with inflation. Rosenberg's estimates for individuals are
slightly higher, but, of course, individuals don't live forever.
</P>
<P>
   He said even that the relatively few people who tithe, following
the biblical injunction to give away 10 percent of income, are out
of step with modern finance because they ignore investment assets.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg's organization has trademarked the word ``newtithing''
for his concept of charitable giving based on assets and surplus
income. The idea was first outlined in his book ``Wealthy and Wise:
How You and America Can Get the Most Out of Your Giving'' (Little
Brown, 1994); it is also explained in detail at www.newtithing.org,
his organization's Web site, which will have a calculator to show
giving capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Newtithing grew out of ``my own experience soliciting
donations,'' said Rosenberg, whose family foundation has $32
million. ``I was disappointed, even angry, that people I knew were
giving little compared to their estimated wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   He came to believe that some individuals he regarded as stingy
were simply listening to standard tax advice and then measuring
their capacity to give largely in terms of income. ``A lot of
people have been waiting for some validation that it is all right
to give a lot more,'' he said. ``I am giving it to them based on
research.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Schervish, a Boston College social work professor who has
studied the wealthy for 15 years, says assets are increasingly
being counted in calculations of the capacity to give, a dramatic
change that Rosenberg is helping to spur.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is attempting to mobilize the consciousness and the
consciences of wealth holders to appreciate how much wealth they
have and what good they can do with their wealth,'' Schervish said.
``And he is right that advisers focus on income, not wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   Famed money manager Peter Lynch and former President Jimmy
Carter are among those who endorse his approach.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg advises people to first figure out how much they need
to maintain their life style, get them through any imaginable
turmoil and provide for their families.
</P>
<P>
   But after that, he said, many Americans even at the $50,000
income level have more wealth than they need. He recommends that
those people increase their giving now so that they learn how to
give in ways that accomplish goals _ whether more opera in their
cities or more after-school recreation for poor children. And as
they learn how to make a difference with their gifts, he said, they
should further step up their giving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am trying to convince people, especially wealthy people,
that it is very much in their interest to give away much more and
to create a society where they can live safer, happier, better
lives,'' Rosenberg said. ``They just need to change how they think
about how much they can afford to give.''

THE CULTURE OF MONEY: WHO'S MIXING THE COLORS WE LOVE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, April 4) 
Daniel Akst is a novelist and financial journalist. His column on
the cultural dimensions of money and business appears the first
Sunday of each month. E-mail: culmoney(AT)nytimes.com. 
(bl) 
 By DANIEL AKST   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Were we filled with envy? Tinted by our obsession with money?
Consumed with longing for a more natural life? Who knows why
everyone seemed to like the color green so much in the '90s?
</P>
<P>
   The point is, green is over. If gray is the new black, then blue
is the new green. And at the turn of the century, orange will be
the rage.
</P>
<P>
   So say America's color gurus, who preside over one of the
grandest intersections of money and culture. You may think that
your favorite color is yours alone, an expression of your bodily
humors or your inner paint chip. But when it comes to hues, no
consumer is an island.
</P>
<P>
   It matters who you are, where you live, and of course, what you
see. We influence one another's tastes, naturally. But we're
probably influenced most by the marketing messages, overt and
subtle, that bombard us every waking hour like gamma rays from
Planet Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   In this sense, the wonderful world of color (remember Disney's
TV program?) is a mysterious one, where it is never quite clear how
or why a particular hue suddenly becomes popular and just as
quickly disappears. Why, for instance, were harvest gold, persimmon
and that scary avocado so widely embraced for so long? Was it part
of a larger movement in the 1960s toward reconnecting with the
natural world? Or were people just tired of the colors of the '50s?
</P>
<P>
   These questions are crucial in business, because the right color
can sell a product that the wrong color will kill. Much time and
treasure is spent trying to identify and promulgate the next hot
color. And such machinations lead naturally to questions on a
higher plane: Do the color gods really permit free will, or is
orange predestined somehow? The next time you buy a car, who really
decides what color you end up with? What do we mean by ``you?''
</P>
<P>
   The Mount Olympus of the world of color is an organization
called the Color Marketing Group, in which people from various
industries get together either to divine or dictate, depending on
your level of cynicism, the colors that people will like and want.
CMG says it's blue for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course you have free will,'' said Harold Linton, a color
forecasting specialist at Bradley University in Peoria, Ill., who
projects orange as the blue for the new millennium. ``Yet at the
same time, you're tied to this massive industrial complex.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a complex that's hard to shake. Japan and Europe each have
a big organization analogous to the Color Marketing Group, which
also has a smaller competitor in America, the Color Association. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But where is the person so fatalistic as to suggest that color
choices reflect nothing beyond orchestrated indoctrination? Wasn't
Picasso on to something when he said, ``Colors, like features,
follow the changes of the emotions?''
</P>
<P>
   The colors of the moment change in part because times change.
Kenneth Charbonneau, a color consultant to Benjamin Moore &AMP; Co. and
former president of the Color Marketing Group, says it's the
economy: During hard times, people stick to conservative colors
like navy, burgundy and hunter green, but in more ebullient times,
people go for brighter hues. The yellow or red power ties of the
1980s were classic chromatic symptoms of a boom.
</P>
<P>
   Color specialists like Charbonneau look at economic as well as
other factors. Social trends like immigration and the growth of the
Sun Belt and Pacific Northwest all play a role.
</P>
<P>
   ``The climate alone tells you you don't want green in Seattle,''
Charbonneau said.
</P>
<P>
   Trends in business count, too. When fashion designers like Ralph
Lauren and Calvin Klein cross over into home furnishings, they
amplify the influence of fashion on color selection throughout the
consumer economy. America's car culture does the same thing for the
auto industry.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget technology. On top of color television and
color presses at newspapers, there are new construction materials
and paint formulations that create more kinds and combinations of
colors in home design and decoration. Look for more special
effects, like iridescence.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's hard to avoid suspecting that, at base, it's really
about planned obsolescence.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, The Trend Curve, a newsletter for the home
furnishings industry, suggested that millions of aging baby boomers
might soon be holding yard sales to get rid of stuff that they were
inheriting from their parents. But what if consumers concluded that
yard-sale treasures were a fine way to furnish a home on a budget,
and decided to buy secondhand instead of new?
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to guard against it,'' The Trend Curve warned,
``is to insure that home furnishings 10 years from now look
different than they do today.''(BOX) &QL;

SENIORITY: LEARNING THE AIR-FARE ROPES 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, April 4) 
Fred Brock is an editor at The New York Times. His column on the
approach to and arrival at retirement appears the first Sunday of
each month. E-mail: fbrock(AT)nytimes.com. 
(bl) 
 By FRED BROCK

<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Bittenbring says he knows one thing about air fares:
They are too complex for the average mortal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are absolutely unbelievable,'' he said. ``I can't figure
them out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bittenbring, 78, a retired civil engineer who lives in
Arlington, Va., has figured out how to use senior discounts to get
good deals on the major carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the discounts can be pretty sweet. But they all come
with conditions and restrictions, like blackout dates and limited
availability. And, occasionally, other discount or sale fares may
offer a better deal, depending on the route. As usual, it pays to
shop around.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best, and least restrictive, senior deals is offered
by Southwest Airlines, which now serves the New York area from
MacArthur Airport in Islip, on Long Island. For people 65 or older,
the airline offers discounts of 40 percent to 70 percent off
regular fares. The most it will charge for any one-way domestic
ticket is $129, meaning that a round-trip ticket from New York to
California can be had for $258. Of course, because of Southwest's
shorter-haul routes, the flight won't be nonstop, and you may get
nothing but peanuts and beverages along the way.
</P>
<P>
   No advance purchase is necessary, and tickets are fully
refundable. The number of senior-fare seats, however, is limited on
each flight. Information is available at www.southwest.com or by
calling Southwest at 800 435-9792.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest's deals may be hard to beat, but you can get discounts
on other airlines at an earlier age _ 62.
</P>
<P>
   Continental Airlines offers 15 to 20 percent off its advertised
fares, depending on the day of travel. But to get those discounts,
you must pay to become a member of the airline's Freedom Flight
Club _ $75 a year for domestic travel or $125 for both domestic and
international flights. There are no limits on the availability of
these fares (www.continental.com; 800 248-8996).
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want to join the club, Continental _ like many
other airlines _ will give you a flat 10 percent discount off most
advertised fares, no strings attached. But you have to ask.
</P>
<P>
   Continental also sells booklets of four or eight coupons, each
good for any domestic one-way ticket, to people 62 or older. A
four-coupon booklet is $579, making each round trip $289.50. An
eight-coupon book is $1,079, or $269.75 a round trip.
</P>
<P>
   Four-coupon booklets are also offered by American Airlines and
Delta Air Lines, both at $596; U S Airways, $579; Trans World
Airlines and America West, both at $548, and United Airlines,
$541.80.
</P>
<P>
   TWA's coupon books also include certificates for discounts on
flights to Europe and the airline's Getaway vacation packages.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, the coupons are also good for trips to Canada and
certain destinations in the Caribbean and Mexico, as well as
Hawaii. But for Hawaii, it takes two coupons for a one-way ticket,
four for a round trip.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, you must use these coupons within a year, but you
should check with the airline. Of course, you can always redeem a
coupon at the last minute for a ticket that is good for a year, in
effect giving you two years.
</P>
<P>
   Regulations for traveling companions vary, but they often allow
a companion, even if under 62, to accompany you at the same
discount. There are also various taxes and fees that you may have
to pay when you redeem the coupons.
</P>
<P>
   United, American and Delta also offer rather extensive travel
clubs for seniors that include special fares and other discounts
for certain hotels and cruises. They charge fees, however, and
American's and Delta's are temporily closed to new members.

<P>
   Q: Help! I overheard on the way to a staff meeting that resumes
are being accepted for my job as managing editor of a quarterly
magazine for a nonprofit group. I know my performance isn't the
problem. After all, when I started two years ago, I organized my
department from scratch and have reformatted the magazine; reader
interest has increased and we receive nothing but raves with each
issue. Instead, the catalysts seem to be office politics _ a new
director of communications has arrived _ and the fact that I had to
be away for a week because of a family emergency. I'm still invited
to meetings and otherwise treated as if nothing is wrong, but I
have decided to look for other work. How should I be handling this?
</P>
<P>
   A: Planning a career move based on the weight of one rumor is a
little extreme. Before you start faxing your resume all over town,
get the facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be completely not true,'' said Ronna Lichtenberg,
author of ``Work Would Be Great if It Weren't for the People''
(Hyperion, 1998). ``Someone could have been saying it to someone
else because they wished it were true, or it could have been a
moment of maliciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   Blaine L. Pardoe, author of ``Cubicle Warfare'' (Prima, 1998),
is of the same mind. ``Generally speaking, if you're being pushed
out to `seek other career opportunities,' they start doing things
like not inviting you to important meetings,'' Pardoe said.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, you may have the basic facts correct but may be
wildly misinterpreting the big picture. ``Heck, they may be
grooming you for a promotion'' and just looking for a replacement
for your current job, Pardoe said. In other words, it might not be
the right time to line up another job, waltz into your boss' office
and announce, ``I quit.''
</P>
<P>
   You also shouldn't try to confirm the rumor by quizzing
co-workers. Such questions, Ms. Lichtenberg said, would set the
entire office abuzz with unpleasant gossip.
</P>
<P>
   The best bet is to go directly to your supervisor. You don't
have to mention that you overheard anything, Ms. Lichtenberg said.
``Say, `I've been here a while and things seem to be going really
well, but I'd like some feedback on how you think things are going
and how I can do better,''' she advised.
</P>
<P>
   Pardoe also suggested a meeting with the boss: ``I think the
dumbest thing most employees do is not take it right to the
source,'' he said. ``They sit back and wait for the boss to
initiate some sort of action.''
</P>
<P>
   But if your subtle attempts to gather information don't bear
fruit, try the direct approach, Pardoe said: ``Go so far as to tell
the person, `This is what I heard.' What do you have to lose?''
</P>
<P>
   The worst your boss can do, he said, is to acknowledge that
she's looking to replace you. ``At that point, see if you can
negotiate,'' Pardoe advised. ``Say, `OK Cool. Give me a month to go
look for work.'''
</P>
<P>
   It may not be the outcome you want, but at least you won't have
to keep up a phony, everything's-just-fine smile while wondering
when the ax will fall.(BOX) &QL;

IT'S OFFICIAL: BP AMOCO PLANS TO BUY ARCO 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BP Amoco, which is still integrating the oil giant Amoco,
officially announced its planned acquisition of Atlantic Richfield
Co. on Thursday and said it would cut about 2,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The combination would put BP Amoco in the league of a merged
Mobil-Exxon and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group. It would produce more
oil than either of them and would have 59 percent of the refining
capacity in the United States and 28 percent in Europe. It would
control 13 percent of the nation's retail gasoline market and 9
percent in Europe. It would be the largest oil and natural gas
producer in the United States and Britain and would be a major
petrochemical company.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission and European Union regulators must
approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the deal, which has been approved by the boards
of both companies, stockholders of ARCO will receive 0.82 American
depository share of BP Amoco for each of their shares. Based on
Wednesday's closing prices, that is a 13 percent premium and values
the deal at about $26.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of BP Amoco fell $5.8125 Thursday, to $95.8125. ARCO fell
68.75 cents, to $72.4375.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the job cuts will come from ARCO's headquarters in Los
Angeles, which will be eliminated, and others will come in Texas
and Alaska. Not all the cuts will come from ARCO.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings Thursday between analysts and company executives in
London and at the Pierre Hotel in New York, some analysts
questioned whether ARCO management had negotiated hard enough for a
company that has vast reserves of oil and natural gas and is the
largest retailer of gasoline in California.
</P>
<P>
   ARCO chairman and chief executive Michael Bowlin told the
analysts that with the uncertain future of oil prices and the
pressure coming from larger and leaner oil companies, it was a good
deal for ARCO stockholders to get shares in BP Amoco, whose share
price can hold up better under low crude oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bowlin said that ARCO could have remained independent,
some analysts were worried that unless crude oil prices recovered
the company would see its earnings decline and have trouble paying
its annual dividend.
</P>
<P>
   In an indication of just how much pressure lower crude oil
prices have put on medium-sized oil companies over the last year,
executives of both companies said that the initiative for the
takeover came from Bowlin.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Chase, the deputy group chief executive of BP Amoco,
recalled in an interview Thursday that Bowlin came to the company
headquarters in January and to the shock of BP Amoco chief
executive Sir John Browne and himself, proposed that ARCO be
acquired.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Bowlin made it clear that he and other top
executives would not ask for a role after a takeover, assuming that
the overall deal was to their liking.
</P>
<P>
   Chase said that Bowlin would not have a position once ARCO was
taken over. Except for its brand name at its 1,760 gas stations on
the West Coast, the ARCO corporate identity, whose history goes
back to the 1860s, will also disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Under Browne, BP Amoco is already in the process of cutting
10,000 jobs over the next year as part of an effort to save $2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   He said Thursday that the goal was to save an additional $1
billion after ARCO was acquired.
</P>
<P>
   The task of merging so much at first gave the top executives at
BP Amoco pause when Bowlin came with his proposal. ``He caught us
off guard,'' Chase said, and there was concern about taking on
another major acquisition while still trying to integrate Amoco.
</P>
<P>
   The more they looked, the more they realized that ARCO was a
good fit, with strong positions in natural gas in Indonesia and
China, where BP Amoco wants to expand.
</P>
<P>
   There was also Alaska, where both companies made major
discoveries, rode the good times of huge production and struggled
in recent years to stem the decline.
</P>
<P>
   Browne said the goal in Alaska was to combine operations and cut
the cost of production by about 80 cents a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   He said this would make it more attractive to invest in the
fields of Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk, which now produce about 800,000
barrels a day for both companies. That argument has been used to
persuade officials in Alaska to support the takeover.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies will have to return to the state about 300,000
acres that they hold under leases and have not explored to comply
with limits of how much land can be held at one time.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, ARCO has built up a huge refining and marketing
system that uses Alaskan crude. The low transportation costs of
using the Alaskan pipeline and a plentiful supply made it one of
the lowest-cost producers of gasoline in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Even though many of the stations there are older, have not
installed much of the pay-at-the-pump technology that exists
elsewhere and still rely on cash and debit cards, they are in one
of the prime gasoline markets in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Chase described the West Coast as the ``crucible of the world''
as far as selling gasoline, and acquiring ARCO's assets filled a
gap in BP Amoco's ability to compete nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   He added that about $3 billion in assets could be sold as a
result of the takeover, but no decisions have been made.
</P>
<P>
   The early phase of ARCO's integration will be overseen by Dr.
Byron Grote, a mathematician who got his start at Standard Oil of
Ohio and then came up the ranks to become executive vice president
at BP Amoco.
</P>
<P>
   He will be the man in charge because top ARCO executives will
have to survive based on their talent and whether they fit in the
new organization.
</P>
<P>
   An executive involved in the negotiations, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity, said of Bowlin's approach: ``This was not
him saying that it was about me and my job but about the
shareholders and the employees.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive added that Bowlin had seen several years ago that
the industry would consolidate and that the opportunities would
diminish the longer he waited.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing concerns about the ability of a British company to
manage such a huge operation in the United States, Chase said that
both he and Browne had spent long periods in the United States,
adding: ``We feel very comfortable here. This is a place we are
familiar with.''

 &HT;    Appropriated for the faith

 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Christianity triumphed throughout Rome and the rest of
Europe, sites and monuments that were once pagan were co-opted to
Catholic use. Here are some examples:
</P>
<P>
   -- Pink obelisk: In the square of St. Peter's, the famous pink
granite obelisk where lovers meet and tourists mingle dates back
almost 4,000 years. It was built in Heliopolis, Egypt, by a pharaoh
to honor the sun some 2,000 years before Jesus was born, brought to
Rome by Emperor Caligula in 37 B.C., and moved to its present place
in 1586 at the direction of Pope Sixtus V. The move required 900
men and 140 horses. Originally engraved with dedications to
Augustus and Tiberius, the obelisk under Sixtus was dedicated to
Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   -- Baroque extension: On the edge of the the scattered ruins of
the ancient forum, a baroque extension rises above the columned
portico of a first century temple to the emperor Antonius and his
wife Faustina. The extension was added long after the building was
claimed as a church in the 11th century and dedicated to St.
Lorenzo, or St. Lawrence, who was believed to have been condemned
to death there.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Pantheon: Even this ``temple of all the gods,'' sitting
across a plaza from a McDonald's restaurant, was consecrated as a
church in 609 and still serves a local parish. Parts of the
Pantheon became Christian in other ways as well. In 1632, Pope
Urban VIII had bronze from the portico melted for Bernini's
baldacchino, or canopy, over the altar in St. Peter's Basilica.
Michelangelo studied the engineering of the Pantheon dome when
planning the dome of St. Peter's.

 &HT;    Sect defied persecutors and eclipsed an empire
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL SUNDAY, APRIL 4. DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME, Italy
</P>
<P>
   On a sunny morning, the distinctive dome of St. Peter's Basilica
casts a shadow that dominates the landscape as Catholisim still
dominates the life of modern Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors climb hundreds of narrow, curved stairs to St. Peter's
435-foot cupola for a perspective of Rome where riders on motor
scooters regard red lights as suggestions, cellular telephones ring
continually, and tourists line up outside Gucci and Prada.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate Easter, the holiest day of their year, tens of
thousands of Christians will gather outside St. Peter's, the home
church of a billion Catholics. With the year 2000 only months away,
the festivities are a foretaste of a yearlong birthday party
celebrating 2000 years of Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   The setting is appropriate. The history of the faith can be
traced by a walk down these narrow streets.
</P>
<P>
   It began with a Palestinian Jew who, Christians believe, died
and was resurrected almost two millennia ago. Word of that belief
reached Rome, a center of commerce, government and religion, and
the seat of an empire that eventually stretched from Britain to
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, Christianity was tolerated in Rome along with
worship of gods and goddesses from throughout the conquered
territories. But unlike the other cults of the day, Christianity
required exclusivility of its followers. Persecution began when
Roman authorities demanded worship of the ruling emperor and
Christians refused to comply.
</P>
<P>
   Despite adversity, Christianity continued to grow and become
more organized until, in 381, Emperor Theodosius made it the
empire's official religion. For the most part, since that time,
Rome has remained the center of Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living in Rome has given me a better perspective on the
history of the faith through the lives of the saints,'' said J.
Paul Kimes, 25, a native of Birmingham who is studying for the
priesthood at the Vatican's North American College. ``In the
States, the saints always seemed distant. But to know these people
walked these streets, that the blood of the martyrs was shed in
these streets, makes the saints stop being distant and become close
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   In its homeland, there are signs that Catholicism may be losing
influence: In a 1998 poll, a minority of Italians (47.6 percent)
said they are certain of the existence of God, while a majority
(51.9 percent) said they seldom or never attend religious services.
Yet for Christians around the world, Rome remains a pilgrimage
site. They come to study, worship or just to feel closer to their
religious roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``You come to see the universality of the church,'' Kimes said.
``There are people from all over the world here, and the only thing
we have in common is our faith.''
</P>
<P>
   On a Sunday afternoon in the magnificent St. John Lateran
Church, the cathedral church of Rome, nuns in long habits, priests
in robes and lay people in the casual clothes of tourists make
their way in a procession around the geometrically patterned marble
floor of the sanctuary. Incense hangs in the air and light shimmers
off the gilding that seems to cover everything. At the center of
the church, a golden, haloed Jesus stares down.
</P>
<P>
   In a dingy building across the street, other nuns and tourists
make their awkward way up 25 marble steps covered in dark walnut
wood. These stairs, moved from Jerusalem, are said to be the ones
Jesus walked to the trial that led to his death. Small openings in
the wood show what are reputed to be bloodstains.
</P>
<P>
   ``To think Jesus walked up these stairs!'' exclaimed Mike
D'Onofrio, 50, a chemical engineer from Pittsburgh, who had just
made his way up with his wife Carole and daughter Lisa. ``That's as
close as I've ever come to him physically _ except for the
Eucharist, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very powerful,'' said Carole D'Onofrio, 50, a
fund-raiser for a hospital. ``It's breathtaking. It brings your
faith to life in a different kind of way.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Rome's churches claim at least one relic or remembrance
of a saint, but none is more bizarre than the small crypt chapels
of the Church of the Immaculate Conception, adorned with the bones
of dead Capuchin monks arranged in intricate patterns.
</P>
<P>
   A sign at the end of the tour says, ``What you are now, we used
to be: What we are now, you will be.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a telling reminder that mankind seeks immortality through
religion _ especially here in the Eternal City.

   ORVIETO, Italy _ You can see your breath in the sanctuary of St.
Andrew and St. Bartholomew Church on a drizzly Saturday night
during Lent.
</P>
<P>
   Half a dozen space heaters feebly try to battle the chill of a
temperature barely breaking the 30s as older women, in wool or fur
coats, gather on the hard, worn wooden pews to pray the rosary.
Their voices hum below the urgent appeal of the bells in the tower,
which seem to beg others to come. As the women continue their
prayers, the tone of the bells becomes deeper and the rhythm more
frantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ave Maria, piena di grazia,'' the women repeat in Italian_
``Hail Mary, full of grace''_the cadence of the words obvious even
to those who do not know the language.
</P>
<P>
   In front of them, incongruous with the tall gray stone walls and
the dark wood of the church, a representation of Mary is haloed in
small white electric lights.
</P>
<P>
   St. Andrew and St. Bartholomew is a combined parish of about 400
families in the medieval part of this hill town of 21,000 people in
the region of Umbria about 90 minutes from Rome. The church is one
of hundreds of struggling congregations off the usual path of
tourists in Italy, the homeland of Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   Although some 88 percent of Italians identify themselves as
Catholic, Catholicism is often more a matter of culture than of
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Great Christian works of art draw millions of visitors to
museums, the smallest alcove in the largest city may be adorned
with an icon, and a street is likely to bear the name of a saint.
</P>
<P>
   But despite Catholic teachings against artificial birth control
and abortion, the average Italian woman bears only 1.2 children,
and one in four pregnancies end in abortion. Also contrary to
church teachings, Italy's divorce rate doubled between 1980 and
1995 _ although it remains a fraction of that in the United States.
And, only 29 percent of the country's Catholics said they attend
Mass at least once a week, according to a 1998 International Social
Survey Programme, down from 34 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Alita Gia, who will not give her age but describes herself
through an interpreter as ``an old woman,'' comes to Mass at St.
Bartholomew and St. Andrew daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older people come,'' she says. ``Even here, those who are
young, both husband and wife, have to work and young people are in
school.''
</P>
<P>
   In years gone by, she says, the church was fuller. ``People were
freer. Women were much more in church. Since people are busy, women
are much more uninvolved in church.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time St. Andrew and St. Bartholomew's pastor, the Rev.
Marcello Piterelli, steps up to give a homily on Jesus' temptation
by Satan from the book of Matthew, about 40 people are in the pews.
All but a handful are women. There is one family with children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older people are the largest group,'' Piterelli, 77,
acknowledges. In his 52nd year in the priesthood, he has served
this parish and another rural one nearby since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many people who experience intensive spiritual
foment,'' he says. ``They've lost the yeast in their life, what
brings them joy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those people who remain ``firmly connected'' to the church,
he says, are not necessarily tied in to its full spiritual
dimensions. ``Some of them,'' he said, ``are scrupulously attached
to the formality of the gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   As Piterelli prepares the bread and wine, believed to be Jesus'
body and blood, worshippers can hear the bells of another church in
the background.
</P>
<P>
   When they have had communion, Piterelli announces that the Mass
is concluded, and the worshippers go out into a drizzling rain.
</P>
<P>
   Store windows on the streets nearby display bright pottery and
fashionable clothes. And the cobblestone lanes are crowded with
laughing, chatting shoppers.

 &HT;    Vatican is center of diverse and at times divided institution
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL SUNDAY, APRIL 4. DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN.)

   Vatican City
</P>
<P>
   On the ancient gray-brown cobblestones of St. Peter's square,
with moss and trampled cigarette butts between them, gathers a
Sunday morning crowd that seems to be a portrait of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Under a sun that flirts from an overcast sky, American teenagers
in sports jerseys stand next to European women in full-length furs,
dark-faced African nuns in white habits, pale Irish nuns in black
habits and Asian tourists with cameras poised. Three dozen youths
from a church in Naples sing and dance the macarena. A man holds
his cellular telephone out to share the sound as bells begin to
ring out the 11 o'clock hour.
</P>
<P>
   Curved marble arms of a double colonnade seem to reach out from
the basilica to embrace them.
</P>
<P>
   This is ground zero for the largest Christian denomination in
the world, the center of a separate ``country'' with its own
government, newspaper, radio station and publishing house, home to
about 1,000 people. Decisions made here have changed the course of
Europe and the world.
</P>
<P>
   A church has stood on this site since the 4th century when
Christianity became the official religion of the Roman empire. The
facade of the present church is completely obscured by scaffolding
_ as are some 700 sites in the Vatican and Rome _ undergoing
cosmetic work to prepare for the estimated 25 million people
expected to visit in the year 2000. A joke around Rome says that
one church was scaffolded for so long that the scaffolding was
declared a historic structure.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, that does not matter. The attention of the
faithful and the curious is not on the magnificent center of the
building, but on a window above its right arm.
</P>
<P>
   A cheer goes up when a banner is flung out showing the papal
seal. Another, louder cheer follows several minutes later when the
long-awaited man himself appears, postage-stamp sized, to say a
blessing. He greets the school group from Naples, and the children
and their chaperones jump, scream and hug each other. He mentions a
group of Latinos, and they bring out a guitar and begin to sing. An
impromptu festival is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II, the 263rd successor to St. Peter, is the
mortal head of a billion followers of Jesus Christ, considered the
immortal head of the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just, like, the center of everything,'' says Chris Uhl,
17, of Boston, who is wearing a Red Sox baseball cap backward as he
fulfills his ``lifelong dream'' to see the pope. ``He runs the
whole shebang.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II presides over a diverse and sometimes divided
institution seeped in centuries-old tradition and facing modern
challenges. As the most visible, most traveled pope in history, he
has used modern transportation and communication techniques to
connect the planet's scattered population of Catholics, some of
whom are tied together more by sentiment than faith.
</P>
<P>
   While upsetting liberal Catholics _ especially many in the
United States _ by insisting that the church adhere to prohibitions
against contraceptives, married priests and women in the
priesthood, he has become a symbol of the church's endurance.
</P>
<P>
   CeCe Winter Khan, 35, of Ottawa, Kan., is here with her husband
Tariq and her 20-month-old daughter, Caroline. Khan describes
herself as a ``cafeteria Catholic'' who accepts some church
positions and rejects others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my child to attend Catholic schools. I'm active in a
parish. I gave up beer and chocolates for Lent. I go to Mass every
week,'' she says. ``I do not agree with everything the Catholic
church teaches _ I don't agree with the stance against birth
control _ but this pope is someone I really respect. He's a
wonderful, gentle man.''
</P>
<P>
   William DePriest, 28, of Greenbrier, Tenn., who is in the U.S.
Air Force stationed in Naples with a NATO unit, is United
Methodist, one of the denominations that grew out of the split with
Catholicism during the Protestant Reformation, but says he came to
St. Peter's because ``Protestants came from Catholicism, so he's my
pope, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Being here on Sunday ``is awesome. It's overwhelming. It's very
humbling,'' says Barbara Larkin, 63, of Philadelphia. ``The ability
to touch things that are such a part of your religion brings you
closer to it. It makes it seem real. We're where our religion
began.''
</P>
<P>
   To peel back the layers of the Vatican and of Rome is to trace
the development of mankind's beliefs through the epochs. What is
now the seat of Catholic Christendom was the center of a vast pagan
empire at the time Jesus was born in Palestine. As the faith he
founded grew, his followers were sometimes tolerated, sometimes
persecuted until eventually their beliefs became the official
religion of the empire.
</P>
<P>
   Even after they were generally accepted, Christians faced
internal disagreement, political struggle, and papal scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides of the empire _ the Latin-speaking west and the
Greek-influenced east _ came to a final falling out in 1054 when
the head of the church of Rome and the head of the church of
Constantinople formally excommunicated each other. The western
branch became known as the Catholic Church; the eastern is called
the Orthodox Church. In 1965, Pope Paul VI and Patriarch of
Constantinople Athaneagoras I finally canceled the orders but the
churches remain separate.
</P>
<P>
   As Rome became the center of Catholicism _ except for 1305-1377
when the papacy was snatched by the French to Avignon _ the bishop
of Rome evolved into the head of the church, called ``papa,'' or
pope. In the Catholic church, popes were known as sponsors of both
some of the world's greatest Christian art and some of the church's
most blatant abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Pope Sixtus IV, for example, is known for both the Sistine
Chapel and the Spanish Inquisition. The family name of the infamous
Borgia popes has become synonymous with corruption. And the attempt
to fund the construction of St. Peter's Basilica in the early 1500s
resulted in the crass sale of ``indulgences,'' or papal pardons,
that sparked the next major division in Christendom, the Protestant
Reformation.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, though not unscarred and unscathed, the Catholic
church has lasted.
</P>
<P>
   St. Peter's _ believed to be set on the site of the grave of the
apostle whose name it bears _ is the marble representation of the
church.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Peter's is more a place than a building,'' said Charles
Byrd, 35, who is studying at the North American College in Rome to
be a priest in the Archdiocese of Atlanta. ``People were praying
here long before there was a church.''
</P>
<P>
   A sovereign state
</P>
<P>
   While the mystical link between humankind and God is explored in
St. Peter's, more mundane aspects of the Catholic religion are
managed in offices nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican is a government with hundreds of thousands of
citizens spread throughout more than 2,500 dioceses around the
world. More than 160 countries have diplomatic relations with the
world's smallest country.
</P>
<P>
   Within its 108 acres are tennis courts, satellite dishes and a
cemetery. There is a small theater where, occasionally, the pope
watches a film _ most recently ``Vita e Bella,'' or ``Life is
Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   A Vatican gas station keeps the Vatican vehicles fueled. A
Vatican police force guards the buildings and takes reports on the
pickpockets who prey on the pilgrims. A Vatican bookstore sells
volumes in all the major languages. A Vatican post office takes
care of official mail as well as tourists' postcards. And a door
opening onto a narrow street inside the Vatican wall reveals the
ordinariness of an institutional kitchen, with the expected odors.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the walls is a marketplace of street vendors who try to
peddle religious medals, papal snow globes and Vatican refrigerator
magnets to tourists from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheaper than barbecue chicken,'' one yells to a group of
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Monsignor Roger Roensch, who heads the office for North American
visitors to the Vatican, sees both sides of life in the center of
the Catholic Church. Roensch reads the Vatican newspaper in Italian
and English daily and listens to Vatican radio every morning in
Italian, French and English.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I'm shaving, I get the news,'' says Roensch, 66,
formerly a priest in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   He prays in St. Peter's. ``And,'' he said, ``it's great to be in
attendance at the Holy Father's audiences and get to hear him say
all those things most people only read about.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Roensch needs to go from his office, several blocks from
the Vatican, to conduct business inside its walls, he has to pass
through the Vatican police and the colorfully dressed Swiss Guards,
the special unit that guards the Pope.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I need to go to a special office, such as the Secretary of
State, I have to have a written pass,'' he said. ``It's like going
through Customs in the United States. When you go in, you realize
you're going into a sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   2000 a year to celebrate
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican bureaucracy is busy these days preparing for 2000,
declared a Jubilee year by John Paul II. Over the next year, the
city of Rome and the Vatican will host a calendar full of special
events for every segment of Catholicism: the disabled, laborers and
members of religious orders, to name a few. One of the largest will
be World Youth Day in August, expected to draw several hundred
thousand teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   In the Catholic tradition, a Holy Year, or Jubilee, is a year of
forgiveness, reconciliation and commitment to service. The idea
goes back to the days of Moses, when, according to the scriptures,
God told the Israelites to ``hallow the fiftieth year.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the faithful, Pope John Paul II wrote, ``Every
Jubilee Year is like an invitation to a wedding feast. ... The
present task of the Bishop of Rome, as the Successor of Peter, is
to make the invitation to the Jubilee celebration all the more
insistent (for the) two thousandth anniversary of the central
mystery of the Christian faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Catholics will begin the celebration on Christmas Eve this year
when the pope walks through a now-sealed Holy Door in St. Peter's
to symbolize a new beginning _ a metaphor for the new life
Christians claim in Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's a time of hope for the church,'' said Sister
Gilmary Kay, 32, a nun in the Michigan-based Sisters of Mercy who
works with Roensch. ``It's an opportunity to move to greater
holiness in whatever way God has called us.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the year 2000, there is a sense that although the church
remains firmly centered in the Vatican, its power increasingly lies
outside Europe. With Catholic leaders in various parts of the world
raising questions about birth control, clerical celibacy, women's
roles and lay involvement, some significant questions loom as an
aging and frequently ailing John Paul II and the church he heads
move toward a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Louis Dorn of Jefferson City, Mo., senses it. A church
history teacher, he speaks of the ``connectedness'' and
``universality'' he feels at St. Peter's with Catholics around the
world. But in that universality, he is aware of the breadth of the
church beyond its historical roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be fascinating, absolutely fascinating, to see
what comes next,'' Dorn says.
</P>
<P>
   He has come here before sunrise on a recent Monday morning to
offer Mass with some friends in one of the small chapels around St.
Peter's periphery. The scene is much different than the day before
_ no dancing youths, no Latino guitar players, no papal photo
opportunities. Inside the cavernous church, oversized statues of
popes and saints watch over the treasures and tombs. Mosaic
cherubs, their faces made up of fingernail-sized tile, look down
from the heavenly heights above. In a chapel reserved for prayer,
eight nuns _ some in gray, some in blue, some in black _ kneel with
two other women and two men.
</P>
<P>
   On the right-hand side of the entrance to the church, in
Michelangelo's famous Pieta, a smooth-skinned Mary, mother of the
church, is alone with her lifeless marble son. Three dead roses lie
on the floor, their scattered petals blending with the deep pink
and brown marble of the floor. A maintenance man with a long broom
sweeps them away.
</P>
<P>
   But today is special. It is the Feast of the Chair of Peter, and
the statue of St. Peter is dressed as pope in red brocade robe,
gold crown, ring and pectoral cross. One foot remains bare, the
detail of its sculpture worn away by the lips of pilgrims who have
kissed it.
</P>
<P>
   Dorn stands near the adorned Peter as he considers the future of
the church that claims the saint as its first pope.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 20 years or less, a paradigm shift is coming,'' Dorn said.
``For the first time since we left Jerusalem, the Catholic church
is going to be majority Third World, Southern Hemisphere. Europe
has dominated the church since the end of the 1st century. Now,
it's not going to be the major stockholder.''
</P>
<P>
   When cardinals have to elect a successor to the Polish Pope John
Paul II _ himself the first pontiff from outside Italy in
centuries, there is some chance they will choose an African or a
Latin American.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows what they're going to do, including them,'' Dorn
said.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics like to look at papal elections as politics as usual,
he said. ``But I think there's this sense of the spirit moving the
church.

THE BARD'S LIFE MORE COMPLEX THAN IN THE MOVIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1999 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No matter where one turns these days (even over in bed), one is
reminded of William Shakespeare, who either did or did not write
many or some of the plays, sonnets, advertising jingles and e-mails
attributed to him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The several Oscars awarded recently to the lovely, if wildly
fictional, movie ``Shakespeare in Love'' and to members of its cast
are responsible for much of the renewed interest in the mysterious
figure often referred to simply as The Bard. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This attention to an old white guy, dead for nearly 400 years,
must baffle Americans born after, say, the equally mysterious
presidency of Gerald Ford. They must be asking, Who was this
Shakespeare dude, in real life _ whatever, if anything, that is? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They could, of course, pick up an encyclopedia or a decent
biography of the man, but that would require someone to introduce
them to the concept of books. Ha! Or they could leap on the
Internet and check out the hundredyskillion World Wide Web sites
devoted to Shakespeare, who is almost as popular in cyberspace as
pornography and hate crimes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But I will save them all that tedious work. Today I will explain
Shakespeare right here. If some of these younger Americans live in
your home, you may wish to read this to them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Shakespeare, who had a wonderful first name, usually
spelled his last name Shakspere, which shows what he knew. Dubious
records show he was born in Stratford-upon-Avon in England on April
23, 1564. He died on his birthday in 1616. Later, April 23 would
turn out to be the birthday of that great Shakespearian actress
Shirley Temple, to say nothing of the dramatic Braves pitcher, the
mortal Warren Spahn, who, until now, has never been connected in
any way with Shakespeare, except for their common W.S. initials. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Shakespeare was about 18 _ barely old enough to be drafted
_ he married Anne Hathaway, a famous shirt maker who wore a patch
over one eye. Among their children were twins, Judith and Hamnet.
Hamnet, a boy, was named before Shakespeare could write Hamlet
legibly _ or, as he spelled it, Omelet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare either wrote a fabulous batch of magnificent plays
and sonnets or else he was a front-man, a dupe, for someone else.
That someone else either was or wasn't Edward de Vere, 17th earl of
Oxford. Oddly enough, de Vere died in 1604, several years before he
wrote many of the plays onto which he stuck Shakespeare's name. He
used Shakespeare's name to prevent the scandal of a nobleman being
connected with the debased occupation of writing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the same way today, incredibly annoying radio and TV talk
show hosts use such pseudonyms as Rush Limbaugh, G. Gordon Liddy
and Jerry Springer so as not to embarrass their families. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, my own work is written by an exiled Russian prince who
also wishes to avoid the ignominy of owning up to committing
journalism _ or whatever this is. Historians one day will discover
that the name Tammeus is entirely fictitious, the result of a bar
bet one night in Radoshkovichi, northwest of Minsk, decades prior
to the collapse of the Soviet Union. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is a huge debate among otherwise unemployed academics over
who wrote the works of Shakespeare. A great place to find out about
this is at the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C.,
founded by Henry Clay Folger, whose name has nothing to do with
Folger coffee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that coffee company was founded by Edward de Vere, who
paid a London blacksmith, William Folger, for letting him use his
name. This Folger was, in reality, William Shakespeare, who learned
blacksmithing after he hired de Vere to write all his plays. And
all's well that ends well. &QL;

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: There's no place like Lufkin,
Texas
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ A fellow who moved here from the big city was
asking how best to describe our little hometown to folks who've
never been here.
</P>
<P>
   Not to brag, but people who have lived here all their lives and
never been anywhere else will tell you there's no place like
Lufkin.
</P>
<P>
   It's a country town that's grown to more than 30,000 pop. and,
as a result, likes to think of itself as a city.
</P>
<P>
   We have plenty of good restaurants here, and they're easy to
find. All you have to do is follow the traffic to the drive-through
windows.
</P>
<P>
   We have our share of crime. Just last week in the police
reports, the newspaper noted that somebody had burglarized a home.
Among the items taken were a gallon of whiskey and a bottle of
Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it's a fun-loving place.
</P>
<P>
   A few years back a poll of the community asked residents how
they liked to spend their leisure time.
</P>
<P>
   The response was overwhelmingly consistent.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 was reading the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 was shooting guns.
</P>
<P>
   Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   It's not our town motto, but I guess it could be.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of hunting and fishing hereabouts, and all sorts of outdoor
sports.
</P>
<P>
   Deer season, bird season, tourist season.
</P>
<P>
   I can remember when we even had bear season, some 35 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   I was working at the newspaper and took the picture of the last
black bear killed in this part of the pineywoods, shot while trying
to escape, as I recall.
</P>
<P>
   I remember, too, the time an old boy came in to the newspaper
and wanted his picture made with a couple of wolves he said he'd
killed. We took the photo of him standing beside his pickup truck,
the dead wolves hanging off the back of the tailgate.
</P>
<P>
   We got a complaint the next day after the picture ran in the
paper, not from the fellow in the photo but from a farm neighbor of
his. It turned out they were his German shepherd dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Honest mistake. But I always thought the flea collars should
have tipped us off.
</P>
<P>
   Lot of pickups in Lufkin _ trucks, not tricks, you understand.
</P>
<P>
   Folks do love their trucks. They consider them a statement of
their lifestyle, particularly the bumper stickers.
</P>
<P>
   One I saw on the cracked back window of a dappled old truck with
a crumbled fender or two:
</P>
<P>

<P>
   So, what's Lufkin like?
</P>
<P>
   That's something I'm asked regularly when I'm traveling.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lot like Paris, I tell people.
</P>
<P>
   Paris has the Eiffel Tower. Lufkin has a water tower.
</P>
<P>
   Paris has the Arc de Triomphe. Lufkin has an underpass.
</P>
<P>
   Paris has the Louvre. Lufkin has a Jiffy Lube.
</P>
<P>
   Lufkin, the City of Lite.
</P>
<P>
   It's not our town motto, but I guess it could be.

 &HT;    U.S. SHORTCOMINGS AN OPEN SECRET IN KOSOVO CONFLICT
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Among the rules for war-making, one of the most
ancient is never to let the enemy know your weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kosovo conflict, however, U.S. shortcomings are so openly
discussed that one was featured in David Letterman's ``Late Night''
monologue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things could not be getting worse in the Balkans,'' quipped
the comic, drawing from a report that the U.S. Air Force is running
out of cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``A shortage of bombs? Well, hell, call CBS,'' he chortled in a
poke at his own network.
</P>
<P>
   The joke wins few laughs from military experts, who find it
troubling that the Pentagon has admitted that the U.S. arsenal is
down to its last 100 air-launched cruise missiles, the $1 million
bombs that can be programmed to fly to targets. Spokesman Kenneth
Baker told reporters this week that the dwindling supply was
``something that we do worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a public concession ``is very unfortunate,'' said Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., in a telephone interview from New Hampshire this
week shortly before he delayed announcing his presidential campaign
because of the Kosovo conflict. ``I can't help thinking it might
serve to encourage (Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce A. Johnson, a scholar with the conservative Hudson
Institute, offered a harsher assessment. ``You've told the enemy,
'Hang in there, dude, we've only a few left to lob at you,' `` he
said. ``And it tells every other troublemaker in the world that the
United States has failed to build up its defensive arsenal of
weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the U.S. Navy still has thousands of smaller,
sea-launched cruise missiles that could accomplish much the same
purpose as the Air Force's cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   But talk of the shortage is only one part of the public
hand-wringing over limitations that has marked the first week and a
half of NATO action against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has all but ruled out ground forces for the
present, saying that ``it is not my intention'' to deploy them.
NATO officials have debated over whether to deploy low-flying A-10
attack planes. And for days the allies have pondered the dangers to
civilians if the allies bomb the defense ministry in downtown
Belgrade, even as its occupants were reported to be moving
operations to safer sites, possibly including a monastery.
</P>
<P>
   Such public discourse could increase risks to NATO forces, said
former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. ``I think the goal is to
complexify the problem for the enemy and not simplify it,'' he told
CNN on Thursday. ``And so when you begin to start ruling things
out, like ground troops, or say we're only going to hit these
targets and not those targets, the effect of that, it seems to me,
is to make the problem for the other side much simpler.''
</P>
<P>
   To other critics, the public disclosures are secondary effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bigger problem is there is no strategy,'' said Frank
Gaffney, who served as assistant defense secretary under President
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Gaffney said he was glad the public knows about problems such as
the cruise missile shortage. ``On balance, I think it's better for
the American people to know about this and catalyze them to take
corrective action,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the open debate is a stark contrast with the
first wave of air assaults against Iraq in the 1991 Persian Gulf
war, during which the U.S. forces kept a tight lid of secrecy on
much of their operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a different era where information flows freely,''
McCain said. ``Maybe after this conflict is over, we ought to look
at it and see whether it did any harm or not.''

<P>
   For the Aztecs, human sacrifices were ironically the stuff of
life. Only human blood, they told Spanish priests, could give the
sun strength for its daily climb from the underworld.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the grisly accounts of the early Spanish
chroniclers, archeologists have exhumed surprisingly little
evidence of these rituals. But thanks to a series of stunning
archeological discoveries, researchers are now gaining a clearer
glimpse of these ancient rituals.
</P>
<P>
   The picture emerges not from the most famous civilizations, but
from a much earlier and lesser known Andean people _ the Moche of
Peru's northern coastal desert. They flourished from A.D. 100 to
800 in the river valleys from the Andes to the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, archeologists puzzled over the paintings on Moche
pots. Many portrayed knife-wielding gods holding human heads and
owl-headed priests presiding over human sacrifices, but few
researchers believed they reflected actual practices. But
researchers are uncovering startling forensic evidence of human
sacrifice _ from mass graves to giant wall murals incorporating
butchered human bones.
</P>
<P>
   These new discoveries raise a host of questions, not the least
of which is why the Moche performed human sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Canadian archeologist Steve Bourget began
searching for sites where the Moche performed their slaughter.
Bourget, who had just finished his Ph.D. dissertation on Moche art
and sacred geography, found depictions of mountaintop rituals in
which priests seemed to fling humans to their death down steep
slopes. If the Moche pots showed real events, reasoned Bourget,
then the sacrifices could have taken place near Moche temples
situated at the feet of small mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Bourget began poring over Moche depictions of a different
sacrifice ritual, one that had been studied by Christopher Donnan,
an archeologist at UCLA. The gruesome ritual, which Donnan called
the warrior narrative, was a favorite theme of Moche artists,
appearing on ancient pots and wall murals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts with Moche warriors going off to combat,'' Donnan
explains. ``Then some of the warriors are captured. All their
weapons, ornaments and clothing are taken from them. What follows
is a stage where the captors ... slap their faces and tear the
warriors' nose ornaments out. They put ropes around their necks and
parade them. The sacrifice follows.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnan, like other Moche experts, assumed that the warrior
narrative owed more to fiction than fact. But in 1987, Peruvian
archeologist Walter Alva exhumed the body of a great Moche lord,
dating to approximately A.D. 300. The man wore large circular
earspools and an immense gold headdress, a nose ornament and a back
flap, all crescent-shaped like the blade of a sacrificial knife. By
his side lay a scepter with a bladelike handle. These were the
insignia of the warrior priest.
</P>
<P>
   But if the sacrifices were actual events, where were all the
victims? Bourget studied depictions of the warrior narrative for
clues. And in 1995, he assembled a research team to excavate the
plaza at the Pyramid of the Moon.
</P>
<P>
   Peeling back layers of sediment, he was soon surrounded by
whitened human skeletons. Bourget was jubilant. ``For the first
time, we could really see how the Moche performed human
sacrifice,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Such a rare and complex burial site called for a specialist.
John Verano, a physical anthropologist and osteologist who had
worked with archeological teams on Peru's north coast, was
summoned. He set up an impromptu morgue in the Archeology Museum at
the University of Trujillo where he examined the collection of
human remains.
</P>
<P>
   Verano found that all the corpses who could be identified
belonged to a select demographic group: young, healthy, physically
active males. Indeed, the mean age at death was just 23. Many, it
turned out, were old hands at combat. One in every four bore healed
rib, arm, leg and skull fractures.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many of the men had fractures just beginning to
knit at the time of death. These confirmed the story, corresponding
eerily to scenes from the warrior narrative.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Moche art,'' Verano says, ``the artists often show
prisoners being smacked on the nose so their noses will bleed, and
that's often done at the time of capture.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the healing of wounds, the battered men survived
for nearly two weeks after their capture, their last weeks mired in
misery. Death, when it finally arrived, came swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   Verano's data suggests that the bodies at the Pyramid of the
Moon belonged to Moche warriors wounded and captured on the field
of battle. It is entirely possible, he says, that the ancient
desert dwellers, like the Aztecs, fought at least some battles
specifically to capture young males for sacrifice. Just how often
the Moche conducted sacrifices and how many lives they took has yet
to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Verano discovered something strange about an
enormous mural on the site. The pre-Columbian mural, painted in
crimson and electric yellow, shows a row of Moche nobles dancing
above the heads of war captives. While studying the mural,
researchers found a fallen chunk of mud plaster from one of the
dancer's feet. A piece of bone protruded from one end. Verano could
see that it was the rounded end of a human femur. It had been
chopped from a cadaver, stripped of flesh, and incorporated into
the giant mural.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dancers are stepping on the bones of their enemies,'' he
says, ``or their victims.''
</P>
<P>
   While new evidence explains much about how sacrifices were
performed, it falls far short of answering why. Researchers such as
Elizabeth Benson have traced an intimate link between the offering
of human lives and agricultural fertility.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, people thought they could change the world by
ritual,'' Benson says. ``This was how you controlled the world, how
you had enough food for your people. And a human being was the most
important offering you could make.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SIDEBAR: WHY DID THE GODS DEMAND BLOOD? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``To the people who say the Moche or the Aztecs did sacrifices
because their gods demanded it, I would say, Why did their gods
demand it and other peoples' gods did not?'' observes Michael
Winkelman, an anthropologist at Arizona State University in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   Winkelman studied scientific accounts of 45 societies worldwide
and came up with seven sacrifice performing societies, from the
Marquesans of the South Pacific to the Romans. He detected several
common, distinguishing traits: nearly all suffered from high
population densities and fought wars over land and scarce
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, all the sacrificing societies were ruled locally by a
leader from a powerful family; in such a system, treachery and
betrayal were constant threats. To intimidate those contemplating
betrayal, Winkelman says, leaders naturally gravitated toward human
sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Moche experts call Winkelman's work thought-provoking, but few
are ready to accept that his analyses apply to the Moche, because
not enough is known about their population density or political
organization.

slopes. If the Moche pots showed real events, reasoned Bourget,
then the sacrifices could have taken place near Moche temples
situated at the feet of small mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Bourget began poring over Moche depictions of a different
sacrifice ritual, one that had been studied by Christopher Donnan,
an archeologist at UCLA. The gruesome ritual, which Donnan called
the warrior narrative, was a favorite theme of Moche artists,
appearing on ancient pots and wall murals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts with Moche warriors going off to combat,'' Donnan
explains. ``Then some of the warriors are captured. All their
weapons, ornaments and clothing are taken from them. What follows
is a stage where the captors ... slap their faces and tear the
warriors' nose ornaments out. They put ropes around their necks and
parade them. The sacrifice follows.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnan, like other Moche experts, assumed that the warrior
narrative owed more to fiction than fact. But in 1987, Peruvian
archeologist Walter Alva exhumed the body of a great Moche lord,
dating to approximately A.D. 300. The man wore large circular
earspools and an immense gold headdress, a nose ornament and a back
flap, all crescent-shaped like the blade of a sacrificial knife. By
his side lay a scepter with a bladelike handle. These were the
insignia of the warrior priest.
</P>
<P>
   But if the sacrifices were actual events, where were all the
victims? Bourget studied depictions of the warrior narrative for
clues. And in 1995, he assembled a research team to excavate the
plaza at the Pyramid of the Moon.
</P>
<P>
   Peeling back layers of sediment, he was soon surrounded by
whitened human skeletons. Bourget was jubilant. ``For the first
time, we could really see how the Moche performed human
sacrifice,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Such a rare and complex burial site called for a specialist.
John Verano, a physical anthropologist and osteologist who had
worked with archeological teams on Peru's north coast, was
summoned. He set up an impromptu morgue in the Archeology Museum at
the University of Trujillo where he examined the collection of
human remains.
</P>
<P>
   Verano found that all the corpses who could be identified
belonged to a select demographic group: young, healthy, physically
active males. Indeed, the mean age at death was just 23. Many, it
turned out, were old hands at combat. One in every four bore healed
rib, arm, leg and skull fractures.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many of the men had fractures just beginning to
knit at the time of death. These confirmed the story, corresponding
eerily to scenes from the warrior narrative.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Moche art,'' Verano says, ``the artists often show
prisoners being smacked on the nose so their noses will bleed, and
that's often done at the time of capture.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the healing of wounds, the battered men survived
for nearly two weeks after their capture, their last weeks mired in
misery. Death, when it finally arrived, came swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   Verano's data suggests that the bodies at the Pyramid of the
Moon belonged to Moche warriors wounded and captured on the field
of battle. It is entirely possible, he says, that the ancient
desert dwellers, like the Aztecs, fought at least some battles
specifically to capture young males for sacrifice. Just how often
the Moche conducted sacrifices and how many lives they took has yet
to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Verano discovered something strange about an
enormous mural on the site. The pre-Columbian mural, painted in
crimson and electric yellow, shows a row of Moche nobles dancing
above the heads of war captives. While studying the mural,
researchers found a fallen chunk of mud plaster from one of the
dancer's feet. A piece of bone protruded from one end. Verano could
see that it was the rounded end of a human femur. It had been
chopped from a cadaver, stripped of flesh, and incorporated into
the giant mural.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dancers are stepping on the bones of their enemies,'' he
says, ``or their victims.''
</P>
<P>
   While new evidence explains much about how sacrifices were
performed, it falls far short of answering why. Researchers such as
Elizabeth Benson have traced an intimate link between the offering
of human lives and agricultural fertility.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, people thought they could change the world by
ritual,'' Benson says. ``This was how you controlled the world, how
you had enough food for your people. And a human being was the most
important offering you could make.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SIDEBAR: WHY DID THE GODS DEMAND BLOOD? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``To the people who say the Moche or the Aztecs did sacrifices
because their gods demanded it, I would say, Why did their gods
demand it and other peoples' gods did not?'' observes Michael
Winkelman, an anthropologist at Arizona State University in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   Winkelman studied scientific accounts of 45 societies worldwide
and came up with seven sacrifice performing societies, from the
Marquesans of the South Pacific to the Romans. He detected several
common, distinguishing traits: nearly all suffered from high
population densities and fought wars over land and scarce
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, all the sacrificing societies were ruled locally by a
leader from a powerful family; in such a system, treachery and
betrayal were constant threats. To intimidate those contemplating
betrayal, Winkelman says, leaders naturally gravitated toward human
sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Moche experts call Winkelman's work thought-provoking, but few
are ready to accept that his analyses apply to the Moche, because
not enough is known about their population density or political
organization.

   For at least the next five years, NASA's Cassini spacecraft, six
tons of brute technology laboriously wending its way to Saturn and
its giant moon Titan, will serve nicely as a bloated billboard with
this message: The era of big, unmanned space missions is over. Not
only did the craft's considerable heft force an impressively
circuitous route that depends on the gravitational pull of three
heavenly bodies, but its $2 billion cost clashed ominously with the
U.S. space agency's shrinking budget.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the extinction of the dinosaurs cleared a place for
little, lithe mammals, so the termination of huge missions like
Cassini will create opportunities for petite but powerful
explorers. Under strict orders from NASA administrator Daniel
Goldin, whose mantra is ``better, faster, cheaper,'' the agency is
moving toward ideas reminiscent of science-fiction novels _ robots
that could fit on a spoon, solar sails and rockets no larger than a
computer chip. The technologies will be seen in the real world
surprisingly soon.
</P>
<P>
   At the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., ground
zero for NASA's tightened focus, a tiny rover called MUSES-CN
symbolizes the merits of miniaturization. MUSES resembles a
drastically downsized version of Sojourner, the remote-control
chariot that enchanted the public two summers ago as it rolled
across Mars. The reduced rover measures just six inches long and
weighs 42 ounces. Its size will allow it to ride piggyback on the
already-planned Japanese MUSES-C probe, to be launched at the
asteroid Nereus in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   MUSES is only a beginning. Rover mastermind Brian Wilcox is
developing tiny rovers that weigh no more than a few ounces.
Another little buggy may ride aboard the Near-Earth Asteroid
Prospector _ history's first privately funded deep-space probe. The
European Space Agency is working on ROSA, a six-wheeled robot
designed to tackle the worst terrain Mars has to offer. Other
exotic vehicles are in the works at JPL as well, such as a
``subsurface explorer'' _ a 2-inch-wide rod with a pressurized
gas-driven hammer that burrows eagerly underground.
</P>
<P>
   The spacecraft that fly the rovers are likewise dieting. Barry
Hebert's micro-spacecraft group at JPL is building radically
downsized vehicles, weighing as little as two pounds. Several could
fly into space on top of a single inexpensive Pegasus missile.
</P>
<P>
   They could then ``set up a virtual network _ a kind of Internet
in space,'' Hebert says. Networking would allow coordinated
activities such as observing an asteroid from all sides at once or
building a complex telescope that could reveal details far too fine
_ even for the Hubble Space Telescope. Hebert promises test flights
of his miniature spacecraft within the next couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Featherweight spacecraft are a perfect fit with solar-sail
propulsion. Radiation from the sun could accelerate a huge but very
thin light collector to extremely high speeds. Later this year, the
space shuttle may carry a solar sail into Earth orbit to prove the
concept works.
</P>
<P>
   A few technological visionaries, such as inventor Forrest Bishop
of the Institute of Atomic-Scale Engineering, are planning machines
that can travel to other star systems and reconfigure themselves
molecule by molecule. Once they reach their target, they will seek
out raw materials, build sensors and an antenna, then relay images
back home.
</P>
<P>
   NASA scientists, staring at tight funding restrictions, dare not
embrace such dreaming. But that doesn't bother Bishop. ``In the
long term,'' he says, ``space will become a private venture.
Bureaucrats are not going to colonize the solar system.''

   For the Aztecs, human sacrifices were ironically the stuff of
life. Only human blood, they told Spanish priests, could give the
sun strength for its daily climb from the underworld.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the grisly accounts of the early Spanish
chroniclers, archeologists have exhumed surprisingly little
evidence of these rituals. But thanks to a series of stunning
archeological discoveries, researchers are now gaining a clearer
glimpse of these ancient rituals.
</P>
<P>
   The picture emerges not from the most famous civilizations, but
from a much earlier and lesser known Andean people _ the Moche of
Peru's northern coastal desert. They flourished from A.D. 100 to
800 in the river valleys from the Andes to the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, archeologists puzzled over the paintings on Moche
pots. Many portrayed knife-wielding gods holding human heads and
owl-headed priests presiding over human sacrifices, but few
researchers believed they reflected actual practices. But
researchers are uncovering startling forensic evidence of human
sacrifice _ from mass graves to giant wall murals incorporating
butchered human bones.
</P>
<P>
   These new discoveries raise a host of questions, not the least
of which is why the Moche performed human sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Canadian archeologist Steve Bourget began
searching for sites where the Moche performed their slaughter.
Bourget, who had just finished his Ph.D. dissertation on Moche art
and sacred geography, found depictions of mountaintop rituals in
which priests seemed to fling humans to their death down steep
slopes. If the Moche pots showed real events, reasoned Bourget,
then the sacrifices could have taken place near Moche temples
situated at the feet of small mountains.

pots. Many portrayed knife-wielding gods holding human heads and
owl-headed priests presiding over human sacrifices, but few
researchers believed they reflected actual practices. But
researchers are uncovering startling forensic evidence of human
sacrifice _ from mass graves to giant wall murals incorporating
butchered human bones.
</P>
<P>
   These new discoveries raise a host of questions, not the least
of which is why the Moche performed human sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Canadian archeologist Steve Bourget began
searching for sites where the Moche performed their slaughter.
Bourget, who had just finished his Ph.D. dissertation on Moche art
and sacred geography, found depictions of mountaintop rituals in
which priests seemed to fling humans to their death down steep
slopes. If the Moche pots showed real events, reasoned Bourget,
then the sacrifices could have taken place near Moche temples
situated at the feet of small mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Bourget began poring over Moche depictions of a different
sacrifice ritual, one that had been studied by Christopher Donnan,
an archeologist at UCLA. The gruesome ritual, which Donnan called
the warrior narrative, was a favorite theme of Moche artists,
appearing on ancient pots and wall murals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts with Moche warriors going off to combat,'' Donnan
explains. ``Then some of the warriors are captured. All their
weapons, ornaments and clothing are taken from them. What follows
is a stage where the captors ... slap their faces and tear the
warriors' nose ornaments out. They put ropes around their necks and
parade them. The sacrifice follows.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnan, like other Moche experts, assumed that the warrior
narrative owed more to fiction than fact. But in 1987, Peruvian
archeologist Walter Alva exhumed the body of a great Moche lord,
dating to approximately A.D. 300. The man wore large circular
earspools and an immense gold headdress, a nose ornament and a back
flap, all crescent-shaped like the blade of a sacrificial knife. By
his side lay a scepter with a bladelike handle. These were the
insignia of the warrior priest.
</P>
<P>
   But if the sacrifices were actual events, where were all the
victims? Bourget studied depictions of the warrior narrative for
clues. And in 1995, he assembled a research team to excavate the
plaza at the Pyramid of the Moon.
</P>
<P>
   Peeling back layers of sediment, he was soon surrounded by
whitened human skeletons. Bourget was jubilant. ``For the first
time, we could really see how the Moche performed human
sacrifice,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Such a rare and complex burial site called for a specialist.
John Verano, a physical anthropologist and osteologist who had
worked with archeological teams on Peru's north coast, was
summoned. He set up an impromptu morgue in the Archeology Museum at
the University of Trujillo where he examined the collection of
human remains.
</P>
<P>
   Verano found that all the corpses who could be identified
belonged to a select demographic group: young, healthy, physically
active males. Indeed, the mean age at death was just 23. Many, it
turned out, were old hands at combat. One in every four bore healed
rib, arm, leg and skull fractures.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many of the men had fractures just beginning to
knit at the time of death. These confirmed the story, corresponding
eerily to scenes from the warrior narrative.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Moche art,'' Verano says, ``the artists often show
prisoners being smacked on the nose so their noses will bleed, and
that's often done at the time of capture.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the healing of wounds, the battered men survived
for nearly two weeks after their capture, their last weeks mired in
misery. Death, when it finally arrived, came swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   Verano's data suggests that the bodies at the Pyramid of the
Moon belonged to Moche warriors wounded and captured on the field
of battle. It is entirely possible, he says, that the ancient
desert dwellers, like the Aztecs, fought at least some battles
specifically to capture young males for sacrifice. Just how often
the Moche conducted sacrifices and how many lives they took has yet
to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Verano discovered something strange about an
enormous mural on the site. The pre-Columbian mural, painted in
crimson and electric yellow, shows a row of Moche nobles dancing
above the heads of war captives. While studying the mural,
researchers found a fallen chunk of mud plaster from one of the
dancer's feet. A piece of bone protruded from one end. Verano could
see that it was the rounded end of a human femur. It had been
chopped from a cadaver, stripped of flesh, and incorporated into
the giant mural.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dancers are stepping on the bones of their enemies,'' he
says, ``or their victims.''
</P>
<P>
   While new evidence explains much about how sacrifices were
performed, it falls far short of answering why. Researchers such as
Elizabeth Benson have traced an intimate link between the offering
of human lives and agricultural fertility.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, people thought they could change the world by
ritual,'' Benson says. ``This was how you controlled the world, how
you had enough food for your people. And a human being was the most
important offering you could make.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SIDEBAR: WHY DID THE GODS DEMAND BLOOD? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``To the people who say the Moche or the Aztecs did sacrifices
because their gods demanded it, I would say, Why did their gods
demand it and other peoples' gods did not?'' observes Michael
Winkelman, an anthropologist at Arizona State University in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   Winkelman studied scientific accounts of 45 societies worldwide
and came up with seven sacrifice performing societies, from the
Marquesans of the South Pacific to the Romans. He detected several
common, distinguishing traits: nearly all suffered from high
population densities and fought wars over land and scarce
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, all the sacrificing societies were ruled locally by a
leader from a powerful family; in such a system, treachery and
betrayal were constant threats. To intimidate those contemplating
betrayal, Winkelman says, leaders naturally gravitated toward human
sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Moche experts call Winkelman's work thought-provoking, but few
are ready to accept that his analyses apply to the Moche, because
not enough is known about their population density or political
organization.

   For at least the next five years, NASA's Cassini spacecraft, six
tons of brute technology laboriously wending its way to Saturn and
its giant moon Titan, will serve nicely as a bloated billboard with
this message: The era of big, unmanned space missions is over. Not
only did the craft's considerable heft force an impressively
circuitous route that depends on the gravitational pull of three
heavenly bodies, but its $2 billion cost clashed ominously with the
U.S. space agency's shrinking budget.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the extinction of the dinosaurs cleared a place for
little, lithe mammals, so the termination of huge missions like
Cassini will create opportunities for petite but powerful
explorers. Under strict orders from NASA administrator Daniel
Goldin, whose mantra is ``better, faster, cheaper,'' the agency is
moving toward ideas reminiscent of science-fiction novels _ robots
that could fit on a spoon, solar sails and rockets no larger than a
computer chip. The technologies will be seen in the real world
surprisingly soon.
</P>
<P>
   At the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., ground
zero for NASA's tightened focus, a tiny rover called MUSES-CN
symbolizes the merits of miniaturization. MUSES resembles a
drastically downsized version of Sojourner, the remote-control
chariot that enchanted the public two summers ago as it rolled
across Mars. The reduced rover measures just six inches long and
weighs 42 ounces. Its size will allow it to ride piggyback on the
already-planned Japanese MUSES-C probe, to be launched at the
asteroid Nereus in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   MUSES is only a beginning. Rover mastermind Brian Wilcox is
developing tiny rovers that weigh no more than a few ounces.
Another little buggy may ride aboard the Near-Earth Asteroid
Prospector _ history's first privately funded deep-space probe. The
European Space Agency is working on ROSA, a six-wheeled robot
designed to tackle the worst terrain Mars has to offer. Other
exotic vehicles are in the works at JPL as well, such as a
``subsurface explorer'' _ a 2-inch-wide rod with a pressurized
gas-driven hammer that burrows eagerly underground.
</P>
<P>
   The spacecraft that fly the rovers are likewise dieting. Barry
Hebert's micro-spacecraft group at JPL is building radically
downsized vehicles, weighing as little as two pounds. Several could
fly into space on top of a single inexpensive Pegasus missile.
</P>
<P>
   They could then ``set up a virtual network _ a kind of Internet
in space,'' Hebert says. Networking would allow coordinated
activities such as observing an asteroid from all sides at once or
building a complex telescope that could reveal details far too fine
_ even for the Hubble Space Telescope. Hebert promises test flights
of his miniature spacecraft within the next couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Featherweight spacecraft are a perfect fit with solar-sail
propulsion. Radiation from the sun could accelerate a huge but very
thin light collector to extremely high speeds. Later this year, the
space shuttle may carry a solar sail into Earth orbit to prove the
concept works.
</P>
<P>
   A few technological visionaries, such as inventor Forrest Bishop
of the Institute of Atomic-Scale Engineering, are planning machines
that can travel to other star systems and reconfigure themselves
molecule by molecule. Once they reach their target, they will seek
out raw materials, build sensors and an antenna, then relay images
back home.
</P>
<P>
   NASA scientists, staring at tight funding restrictions, dare not
embrace such dreaming. But that doesn't bother Bishop. ``In the
long term,'' he says, ``space will become a private venture.
Bureaucrats are not going to colonize the solar system.''

   For the Aztecs, human sacrifices were ironically the stuff of
life. Only human blood, they told Spanish priests, could give the
sun strength for its daily climb from the underworld.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the grisly accounts of the early Spanish
chroniclers, archeologists have exhumed surprisingly little
evidence of these rituals. But thanks to a series of stunning
archeological discoveries, researchers are now gaining a clearer
glimpse of these ancient rituals.
</P>
<P>
   The picture emerges not from the most famous civilizations, but
from a much earlier and lesser known Andean people _ the Moche of
Peru's northern coastal desert. They flourished from A.D. 100 to
800 in the river valleys from the Andes to the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, archeologists puzzled over the paintings on Moche
pots. Many portrayed knife-wielding gods holding human heads and
owl-headed priests presiding over human sacrifices, but few

sun strength for its daily climb from the underworld.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the grisly accounts of the early Spanish
chroniclers, archeologists have exhumed surprisingly little
evidence of these rituals. But thanks to a series of stunning
archeological discoveries, researchers are now gaining a clearer
glimpse of these ancient rituals.
</P>
<P>
   The picture emerges not from the most famous civilizations, but
from a much earlier and lesser known Andean people _ the Moche of
Peru's northern coastal desert. They flourished from A.D. 100 to
800 in the river valleys from the Andes to the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, archeologists puzzled over the paintings on Moche
pots. Many portrayed knife-wielding gods holding human heads and
owl-headed priests presiding over human sacrifices, but few
researchers believed they reflected actual practices. But
researchers are uncovering startling forensic evidence of human
sacrifice _ from mass graves to giant wall murals incorporating
butchered human bones.
</P>
<P>
   These new discoveries raise a host of questions, not the least
of which is why the Moche performed human sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Canadian archeologist Steve Bourget began
searching for sites where the Moche performed their slaughter.
Bourget, who had just finished his Ph.D. dissertation on Moche art
and sacred geography, found depictions of mountaintop rituals in
which priests seemed to fling humans to their death down steep
slopes. If the Moche pots showed real events, reasoned Bourget,
then the sacrifices could have taken place near Moche temples
situated at the feet of small mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Bourget began poring over Moche depictions of a different
sacrifice ritual, one that had been studied by Christopher Donnan,
an archeologist at UCLA. The gruesome ritual, which Donnan called
the warrior narrative, was a favorite theme of Moche artists,
appearing on ancient pots and wall murals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts with Moche warriors going off to combat,'' Donnan
explains. ``Then some of the warriors are captured. All their
weapons, ornaments and clothing are taken from them. What follows
is a stage where the captors ... slap their faces and tear the
warriors' nose ornaments out. They put ropes around their necks and
parade them. The sacrifice follows.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnan, like other Moche experts, assumed that the warrior
narrative owed more to fiction than fact. But in 1987, Peruvian
archeologist Walter Alva exhumed the body of a great Moche lord,
dating to approximately A.D. 300. The man wore large circular
earspools and an immense gold headdress, a nose ornament and a back
flap, all crescent-shaped like the blade of a sacrificial knife. By
his side lay a scepter with a bladelike handle. These were the
insignia of the warrior priest.
</P>
<P>
   But if the sacrifices were actual events, where were all the
victims? Bourget studied depictions of the warrior narrative for
clues. And in 1995, he assembled a research team to excavate the
plaza at the Pyramid of the Moon.
</P>
<P>
   Peeling back layers of sediment, he was soon surrounded by
whitened human skeletons. Bourget was jubilant. ``For the first
time, we could really see how the Moche performed human
sacrifice,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Such a rare and complex burial site called for a specialist.
John Verano, a physical anthropologist and osteologist who had
worked with archeological teams on Peru's north coast, was
summoned. He set up an impromptu morgue in the Archeology Museum at
the University of Trujillo where he examined the collection of
human remains.
</P>
<P>
   Verano found that all the corpses who could be identified
belonged to a select demographic group: young, healthy, physically
active males. Indeed, the mean age at death was just 23. Many, it
turned out, were old hands at combat. One in every four bore healed
rib, arm, leg and skull fractures.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many of the men had fractures just beginning to
knit at the time of death. These confirmed the story, corresponding
eerily to scenes from the warrior narrative.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Moche art,'' Verano says, ``the artists often show
prisoners being smacked on the nose so their noses will bleed, and
that's often done at the time of capture.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the healing of wounds, the battered men survived
for nearly two weeks after their capture, their last weeks mired in
misery. Death, when it finally arrived, came swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   Verano's data suggests that the bodies at the Pyramid of the
Moon belonged to Moche warriors wounded and captured on the field
of battle. It is entirely possible, he says, that the ancient
desert dwellers, like the Aztecs, fought at least some battles
specifically to capture young males for sacrifice. Just how often
the Moche conducted sacrifices and how many lives they took has yet
to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Verano discovered something strange about an
enormous mural on the site. The pre-Columbian mural, painted in
crimson and electric yellow, shows a row of Moche nobles dancing
above the heads of war captives. While studying the mural,
researchers found a fallen chunk of mud plaster from one of the
dancer's feet. A piece of bone protruded from one end. Verano could
see that it was the rounded end of a human femur. It had been
chopped from a cadaver, stripped of flesh, and incorporated into
the giant mural.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dancers are stepping on the bones of their enemies,'' he
says, ``or their victims.''
</P>
<P>
   While new evidence explains much about how sacrifices were
performed, it falls far short of answering why. Researchers such as
Elizabeth Benson have traced an intimate link between the offering
of human lives and agricultural fertility.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, people thought they could change the world by
ritual,'' Benson says. ``This was how you controlled the world, how
you had enough food for your people. And a human being was the most
important offering you could make.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SIDEBAR: WHY DID THE GODS DEMAND BLOOD? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``To the people who say the Moche or the Aztecs did sacrifices
because their gods demanded it, I would say, Why did their gods
demand it and other peoples' gods did not?'' observes Michael
Winkelman, an anthropologist at Arizona State University in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   Winkelman studied scientific accounts of 45 societies worldwide
and came up with seven sacrifice performing societies, from the
Marquesans of the South Pacific to the Romans. He detected several
common, distinguishing traits: nearly all suffered from high
population densities and fought wars over land and scarce
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, all the sacrificing societies were ruled locally by a
leader from a powerful family; in such a system, treachery and
betrayal were constant threats. To intimidate those contemplating
betrayal, Winkelman says, leaders naturally gravitated toward human
sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Moche experts call Winkelman's work thought-provoking, but few
are ready to accept that his analyses apply to the Moche, because
not enough is known about their population density or political
organization.

   For at least the next five years, NASA's Cassini spacecraft, six
tons of brute technology laboriously wending its way to Saturn and
its giant moon Titan, will serve nicely as a bloated billboard with
this message: The era of big, unmanned space missions is over. Not
only did the craft's considerable heft force an impressively
circuitous route that depends on the gravitational pull of three
heavenly bodies, but its $2 billion cost clashed ominously with the
U.S. space agency's shrinking budget.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the extinction of the dinosaurs cleared a place for
little, lithe mammals, so the termination of huge missions like
Cassini will create opportunities for petite but powerful
explorers. Under strict orders from NASA administrator Daniel
Goldin, whose mantra is ``better, faster, cheaper,'' the agency is
moving toward ideas reminiscent of science-fiction novels _ robots
that could fit on a spoon, solar sails and rockets no larger than a
computer chip. The technologies will be seen in the real world
surprisingly soon.
</P>
<P>
   At the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., ground
zero for NASA's tightened focus, a tiny rover called MUSES-CN
symbolizes the merits of miniaturization. MUSES resembles a
drastically downsized version of Sojourner, the remote-control
chariot that enchanted the public two summers ago as it rolled
across Mars. The reduced rover measures just six inches long and
weighs 42 ounces. Its size will allow it to ride piggyback on the
already-planned Japanese MUSES-C probe, to be launched at the
asteroid Nereus in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   MUSES is only a beginning. Rover mastermind Brian Wilcox is
developing tiny rovers that weigh no more than a few ounces.
Another little buggy may ride aboard the Near-Earth Asteroid
Prospector _ history's first privately funded deep-space probe. The
European Space Agency is working on ROSA, a six-wheeled robot
designed to tackle the worst terrain Mars has to offer. Other
exotic vehicles are in the works at JPL as well, such as a
``subsurface explorer'' _ a 2-inch-wide rod with a pressurized
gas-driven hammer that burrows eagerly underground.
</P>
<P>
   The spacecraft that fly the rovers are likewise dieting. Barry
Hebert's micro-spacecraft group at JPL is building radically
downsized vehicles, weighing as little as two pounds. Several could
fly into space on top of a single inexpensive Pegasus missile.
</P>
<P>
   They could then ``set up a virtual network _ a kind of Internet
in space,'' Hebert says. Networking would allow coordinated
activities such as observing an asteroid from all sides at once or
building a complex telescope that could reveal details far too fine
_ even for the Hubble Space Telescope. Hebert promises test flights
of his miniature spacecraft within the next couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Featherweight spacecraft are a perfect fit with solar-sail
propulsion. Radiation from the sun could accelerate a huge but very
thin light collector to extremely high speeds. Later this year, the
space shuttle may carry a solar sail into Earth orbit to prove the
concept works.
</P>
<P>
   A few technological visionaries, such as inventor Forrest Bishop
of the Institute of Atomic-Scale Engineering, are planning machines
that can travel to other star systems and reconfigure themselves
molecule by molecule. Once they reach their target, they will seek
out raw materials, build sensors and an antenna, then relay images
back home.
</P>
<P>
   NASA scientists, staring at tight funding restrictions, dare not
embrace such dreaming. But that doesn't bother Bishop. ``In the
long term,'' he says, ``space will become a private venture.
Bureaucrats are not going to colonize the solar system.''

 &HT;    Television coverage of war can do much harm
 &HT;    By Roland Nethaway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ World War I was started in the Balkans by a lone
gunman.
</P>
<P>
   Future generations may tell how World War III was started in the
Balkans by a lone television cameraman.
</P>
<P>
   Television cameras are a greater threat to world peace than
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear weapons in the hands of military generals are so
frightening that they restrain warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Television cameras in the hands of bleeding-heart ratings
hustlers are deadly. They are proven to cause nations to launch
missiles, rain down bombs, put assault forces on foreign beaches
and send soldiers home in flag-draped coffins.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to starting wars for personal gain, peace-loving
Americans should worry less about presidents and world leaders and
more about the executives in charge of television cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, in ``Wag the Dog'' it was television that got the
nation to rally behind the war that the president was conducting
for noble reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The war was fictitious, but the point is that the politicians
knew they could manipulate public opinion by the pictures showed on
television.
</P>
<P>
   The real experts at manipulating public opinion by what is shown
on television are the professionals in charge of the television
cameras. They not only manipulate public opinion daily, they do it
by the hour, half-hour and even down to the split second when they
compete for ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Television coverage of the blood, guts, gore and suffering in
war is better than the typical TV fare of car wrecks and drive-by
shootings. There are no accusations ``if-it-bleeds-it-leads''
sensationalism in televised wars.
</P>
<P>
   War is conducted for moral and honorable reasons on our side of
the television cameras. In case public sentiment turns against the
war, as it did in Vietnam, then it's television coverage that is
moral and honorable.
</P>
<P>
   War is a career-making, ratings-boosting win-win situation for
television.
</P>
<P>
   No proof exists that any politician or television executive
purposefully started a war for personal gain. There have been
rumors, of course, when it comes to politicians.
</P>
<P>
   President Ronald Reagan, for instance, was accused of invading
Grenada to manipulate public opinion in his favor after a terrorist
bomb in Beirut killed 241 Marines and sailors.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's detractors accused him of doing the same
when he ordered attacks in Iraq and later in Sudan and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   If television producers haven't been accused of starting wars
for private gain, they have been accused of whipping up the public
sentiment to send American troops into Somalia, Haiti,
Bosnia-Herzegovina and now into Serbia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It was the television pictures of starving women and children in
Somalia that moved Congress and President Bush to deploy U.S.
troops whose clandestine nighttime arrival was televised back home
by awaiting cameramen.
</P>
<P>
   When television pictures showed that things were going badly in
Somalia, the U.S. troops were pulled out. The television cameras
also left.
</P>
<P>
   In Haiti, television coverage of brutality, poverty and fleeing
refugees caused Clinton to send in U.S. troops, who now have left,
with the county in the same condition.
</P>
<P>
   The television cameras next rushed off to the former Yugoslavia.
Pictures of dead bodies and refugees have ginned up considerable
military activity.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than a threat, television might be the key to world
peace. Perhaps blanket global television coverage of brutality,
suffering and inhumanity will prompt U.S. troops to whip the entire
world into a permanent condition of peace and human kindness.
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned.

U.S. servicemen who had been captured in the Balkans, Coleman said,
``Oh, goodness, here we go again.'' By CARMINA DANINI.

struggled with the same questions that haunt Samira Huremovic, 18,
a refugee of the conflict between Serbians and Muslims in Bosnia.
How do you reclaim a childhood from the rubble of war, the darkness

   COMPUTER-COLUMN (Undated) _ A look at Diamond Multimedia's Rio
PMP300, which allows you to store tunes that you download from the

   FILM-REVIEW-TOWNERS (Undated) _ Consider ``The Out-of-Towners''
to be confirmation that Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn never again
will be anything more than easy, safe amusement. One-time
progenitors of the comedic edge, they seem more willing to evoke
the slapstick of the 1930s screwball comedies than the kind of

 &HT;    The best argument yet for strict gun control
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ A loyal reader called and asked me what she
should do about her possum problem which, as it turns out, wasn't a
possum problem at all but a gun control problem. I warn you now,
this column is going to sing the virtues of strict gun control. Be
prepared.
</P>
<P>
   But more about that in a moment. The woman called me as a last
hope _ I am often called as the very, very last hope _ about what
to do about the three-foot possum who wandered up on her porch
almost nightly to eat from her cat's food dish.
</P>
<P>
   I was tempted to tell her just to get rid of the kitty, name the
possum ``Snookems'' and pretend it was one of those ugly, hairless
cats, but she was serious. For a fact, a three-foot tall possum,
her description, not mine, is
</P>
<P>
   a serious problem.
</P>
<P>
   I gave her all sorts of ideas, the most valuable of which was,
``Ask someone else,'' but none of them satisfied her. She had told
me up front that she lived in the country so I made one final
suggestion to just shoot the possum.
</P>
<P>
   Thus began a story that made me a life-long and firm believer in
gun control. It is a sad tale, really.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that years ago the woman did not have a possum problem
but, rather, an armadillo problem. The armadillo, it seems, loved
to eat from her garden. As anyone who has ever dealt with an
armadillo knows, they are not smart enough to be afraid of
anything. The woman found all manner of shooing and yelling
wouldn't move the armadillo.
</P>
<P>
   That is when she decided to get her husband's 12-gauge shotgun
and do the armadillo in. The only problem was that she didn't like
the kick in the shoulder from a 12-gauge, having gotten a nasty
bruise once. She had been told that she could simply hold the gun
to her side _ outstretched in her arms _ and fire. No kick. No
bruise.
</P>
<P>
   She fetched the gun, moved to within three feet of the
armadillo, held the gun out, closed her eyes and pulled the
trigger.
</P>
<P>
   And nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
   She decided this was because the safety was on. She pushed the
safety button, held the gun out, closed her eyes and pulled the
trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
   It occurred to her then that the gun might not be loaded. She
was right.
</P>
<P>
   She put a shell in the chamber, held the gun out, closed her
eyes and pulled the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing happened. It was the darn safety thing.
</P>
<P>
   She pushed the safety button, held the gun out, closed her eyes
and pulled the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   This time, something happened. First things first: the
armadillo's next meal came from that garden in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   But as the shot was being fired, it seemed as if that 12-gauge
shotgun had a life of its own. It leapt from the woman's hands and
seemed to fly away. By the time its trip was over, the barrel had
embedded in the ground and the stock had darn near broken the
woman's foot.
</P>
<P>
   It was near nighttime, but not dark enough for the woman, who
was dressed in her red-stripped holiday robe which made her appear
as if a giant, jumping peppermint stick had invaded the yard.
</P>
<P>
   She hopped and yelled for five minutes before the phone started
ringing in the house and she had to hop up the porch stairs to get
it.
</P>
<P>
   It was her neighbor on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeri Lynn (of course, I never got the woman's name, but she
sounded like a Jeri Lynn to me) I heard the gun go off. Did you
shoot yourself in the foot?''
</P>
<P>
   Between moaning and crying the woman assured the neighbor she
was fine but swore then and there she would never bear arms again.
</P>
<P>
   The gun stayed where it was until her husband got home, barrel
in the ground, sticking up like a pole. If she had had a piece of
sheet, she could have fashioned a truce flag.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the moral of the story. Without the proper
amount of gun control, firearms can be extremely hazardous to your
feet.

 &HT;    Outside Rome, the elders worship amid empty pews
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL SUNDAY, APRIL 4. DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN.)
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORVIETO, Italy _ You can see your breath in the sanctuary of St.
Andrew and St. Bartholomew Church on a drizzly Saturday night
during Lent.
</P>
<P>
   Half a dozen space heaters feebly try to battle the chill of a
temperature barely breaking the 30s as older women, in wool or fur
coats, gather on the hard, worn wooden pews to pray the rosary.
Their voices hum below the urgent appeal of the bells in the tower,
which seem to beg others to come. As the women continue their
prayers, the tone of the bells becomes deeper and the rhythm more
frantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ave Maria, piena di grazia,'' the women repeat in Italian_
``Hail Mary, full of grace''_the cadence of the words obvious even
to those who do not know the language.
</P>
<P>
   In front of them, incongruous with the tall gray stone walls and
the dark wood of the church, a representation of Mary is haloed in
small white electric lights.
</P>
<P>
   St. Andrew and St. Bartholomew is a combined parish of about 400
families in the medieval part of this hill town of 21,000 people in
the region of Umbria about 90 minutes from Rome. The church is one
of hundreds of struggling congregations off the usual path of
tourists in Italy, the homeland of Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   Although some 88 percent of Italians identify themselves as
Catholic, Catholicism is often more a matter of culture than of
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Great Christian works of art draw millions of visitors to
museums, the smallest alcove in the largest city may be adorned
with an icon, and a street is likely to bear the name of a saint.
</P>
<P>
   But despite Catholic teachings against artificial birth control
and abortion, the average Italian woman bears only 1.2 children,
and one in four pregnancies end in abortion. Also contrary to
church teachings, Italy's divorce rate doubled between 1980 and
1995 _ although it remains a fraction of that in the United States.
And, only 29 percent of the country's Catholics said they attend
Mass at least once a week, according to a 1998 International Social
Survey Programme, down from 34 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Alita Gia, who will not give her age but describes herself
through an interpreter as ``an old woman,'' comes to Mass at St.
Bartholomew and St. Andrew daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older people come,'' she says. ``Even here, those who are
young, both husband and wife, have to work and young people are in
school.''
</P>
<P>
   In years gone by, she says, the church was fuller. ``People were
freer. Women were much more in church. Since people are busy, women
are much more uninvolved in church.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time St. Andrew and St. Bartholomew's pastor, the Rev.
Marcello Piterelli, steps up to give a homily on Jesus' temptation
by Satan from the book of Matthew, about 40 people are in the pews.
All but a handful are women. There is one family with children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older people are the largest group,'' Piterelli, 77,
acknowledges. In his 52nd year in the priesthood, he has served
this parish and another rural one nearby since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many people who experience intensive spiritual
foment,'' he says. ``They've lost the yeast in their life, what
brings them joy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those people who remain ``firmly connected'' to the church,
he says, are not necessarily tied in to its full spiritual
dimensions. ``Some of them,'' he said, ``are scrupulously attached
to the formality of the gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   As Piterelli prepares the bread and wine, believed to be Jesus'
body and blood, worshippers can hear the bells of another church in
the background.
</P>
<P>
   When they have had communion, Piterelli announces that the Mass
is concluded, and the worshippers go out into a drizzling rain.
</P>
<P>
   Store windows on the streets nearby display bright pottery and
fashionable clothes. And the cobblestone lanes are crowded with
laughing, chatting shoppers.

 &HT;    He rues a late garden, but kangaroos on agenda
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ I was contentedly leafing through the
spring seed catalogs, dreaming of fresh butter beans and tomatoes
that don't taste like pink cardboard when she made her
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beverly and Bobby Mobley are going to Australia,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a shocker,'' I replied. ``Has Bobby joined the Army?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course he hasn't joined the Army,'' she said. ``Why do you
say a thing like that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I've never known of anybody going to Australia unless
they were in the Army and were sent there,'' I explained.
``President Roosevelt had to give General MacArthur a direct order
to make him go when the Japanese were about to take Corregidor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby's not an old fuddy-duddy like you,'' she said. ``He
wants to see what the rest of the world is like.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's already been to Rock City and to Birmingham, and to
Alaska where he lost his suitcase and had to wear the same
underwear for a week. I don't think he's ready for extended world
travel,'' I replied.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, when Bobby's wealthy and sophisticated wife
wanted to go to a convention at Disney World, she asked me to give
him lessons on how to behave in high society. After several
sessions over coffee in the Waffle House, I convinced him to leave
his bib overalls and John Deere cap at home. He got by fairly well
except for reading Playboy in the hotel lobby and insisting that
the wine steward bring him a bottle with a screw cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does Bobby have any idea where Australia is?'' I asked. ``They
could take half a dozen vacations in Panama City for the price of
one airplane ticket. The flight from Atlanta to Australia takes
longer than the Gulf War.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They want us to go with them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To Australia!'' I exclaimed. ``No way. If we went to Australia
I wouldn't have time to plant English peas. I'd be late on the
butter beans and Silver Queen, not to mention setting out
tomatoes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Another good reason to go to Australia,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we went to Australia what could we do other than look at
kangaroos?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beverly says they have tickets to hear the Sydney symphony
orchestra in Sydney's famous opera house,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   I was flabbergasted. ``You mean Bobby has agreed to go hear a
symphony orchestra?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' she said, ``he thinks Willie and Waylon are on the
program.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How long are they going to be away on this excursion?'' I
inquired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only about a month.'' she answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Won't they get tired of kangaroos and symphony orchestras?'' I
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won't be in Australia all the time,'' she explained.
``They're also going to New Zealand and the Fiji Islands. If you
want to stay home and plant English peas, I can go by myself. It
won't be like I'm traveling alone. I'll be with Bobby and
Beverly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're saying Bobby is going to take care of both you and
Beverly for nearly a month in three foreign countries when he's
barely been north of Palmetto?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been to Las Vegas,'' she retorted.
</P>
<P>
   As a responsible spouse, I had to think about that. Bobby made
it through the upscale Disney World convention without serious
incidents, but his visit to New Orleans was a near disaster. It's a
long story. In a nutshell, he got caught in a hotel lobby trying to
dispose of a pistol just as President Clinton was arriving. Secret
Service dogs sniffed him out as a suspicious character, and except
for an incompetent New Orleans cop who let him off the hook, he was
looking at 10 to 20 in a federal penitentiary instead of planning a
trip to Australia, New Zealand and Fiji.
</P>
<P>
   I love my wife. I feel responsible for the mother of my
children.
</P>
<P>
   Against my better judgment, and after some negotiations, I
agreed to join Bobby and Beverly on their journey to the South
Pacific. A month is a good chunk out of what's left of my life, but
I just couldn't trust Bobby to look after two adventuresome women
on a continent infested with wombats and crocodiles.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for my promise not to complain about airplane food
and toilets that require an engineering degree from Georgia Tech to
operate, my wife agreed to let me plant an extra row of butter
beans and as many pole beans and as much Silver Queen corn as I
want. After what we're spending on this trip, even she understands
we'll need something to put up for winter.
</P>
<P>
   Against my better judgment, and even though we aren't in world
war like in 1942, we are off to Australia, New Zealand and the Fiji
Islands.
</P>
<P>
   I hope Bobby doesn't cause any problems I can't handle. After he
passed the security check at Hartsfield Airport I'm pretty sure he
left his pistol at home, but I don't know about the bib overalls.
If they show up at the Sydney opera house, so be it.

 &HT;    Williams sisters coming of age
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HILTON HEAD, S.C. _ Martina Hingis has heard the talk, and she
can't say that she likes it. Initially, it was mainly just the
Williams sisters and their eccentric father, Richard, who were
predicting that Venus and Serena would be 1-2 in the world soon.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after the sisters' eye-popping performances the past few
weeks _ a pair of titles for each _ the idea is gaining popular
appeal. Even some of their rivals are admitted believers.
</P>
<P>
   But not Hingis. Stop to consider the facts, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course they have been playing very well the last two
tournaments,'' Hingis said this week at the Family Circle Cup,
``but before it wasn't that great. They still haven't won a Grand
Slam or anything like that. So once they've done this, we can talk
about it then. But not yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The sisters didn't come to the Family Circle Cup, but their
memorable March remains a hot conversation piece here despite
Hingis' admonition.
</P>
<P>
   Venus has won 10 matches in a row, including a three-setter
Sunday against Serena in the final of the Lipton, the so-called
``fifth major.'' Serena, the little sister, has been perhaps more
remarkable. She had won 16 in a row before falling to Venus, and
she made Hingis, Lindsay Davenport and Monica Seles appear helpless
against her speed and power.
</P>
<P>
   In her victory over Hingis last week, Serena had more winners
than the No. 1 player, 48 to 11, and routinely stroked unreturnable
shots off Hingis' serve.
</P>
<P>
   What people are seeing are players with superior court coverage,
power off both wings, huge serves and the ability to end points at
the net. Who else brings the total package physically?
</P>
<P>
   Davenport and Seles lack speed, and Graf and Jana Novotna have
only defensive backhands. Hingis struggles to hold serve against
heavy hitters, who appear to be the future of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting better athletes in tennis _ bigger, stronger,
quicker and also more nimble,'' said Rick Macci, the Williamses'
first professional coach. ``That's what those two bring to the
table that no other players can match.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Macci who in 1991 first made the prediction that the
sisters would ascend to No. 1 before 2000. They were 10 and 11
years old at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be tough this year, but you can see where it is
headed,'' Macci said. It's as though the question is not if they'll
be No. 1, but who will get there first.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is they both will be at the top,'' said the
third-ranked Novotna, who has had more success than most against
Venus, holding a 3-1 career edge.
</P>
<P>
   Novotna won't choose between the two, but those who will are
going with Serena more and more. One is Amanda Coetzer, a former
top-five player who has lost to both sisters by identical 6-4, 6-0
scores this year. ``Serena's game, to me, is a little bit more
consistent,'' Coetzer said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Serena proponent is Graf, who picked her to beat Venus
at the Lipton.
</P>
<P>
   Irina Spirlea, who branded Venus as stuck-up after their 1997
U.S. Open semifinal, also favors Serena. ``Not that Venus isn't
playing well, but I think Serena is playing cleaner,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Williams, who once claimed Serena ultimately would
surpass her sister, has changed his opinion now. ``Venus is too
strong and too fast and hits the ball too hard,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, for once, agreed with Richard Williams. ``Venus has
always been the more dangerous of the sisters,'' she said. ``She's
more tough mentally to play and beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Serena has suffered moments of despair in the clutch, most
notably her collapses against Hingis at last year's Lipton and
against Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario at the 1998 French Open.
</P>
<P>
   For Serena, gutty wins over Hingis and Graf this year were
ghost-busters. They also earned her respect in the locker room. In
fact, the sisters, by backing up their brashness, are rarely
criticized for arrogance anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Spirlea, once a bold critic, has made peace. ``I think they've
changed a lot,'' she said this week. ``I mean, now we start making
jokes, and they can handle it. They are normal now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis remains curious to see how the sisters will handle their
latest success. They've always been the hunters, Hingis noted. Now,
rivals are beginning to lay low for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how it felt when nobody was beating me,'' said Hingis,
who opened 1997 with a 37-match winning streak. ``You feel
invincible. But at that stage, you have to keep motivating
yourself, because the other players are going to go after you.
That's what we're doing now.''

   MEXICO-BOTANICAL _ MEXICO CITY _ The Spanish conquistadors
talked about suffering for months because they had to eat local
``weeds'' as they marched through Mexico nearly 500 years ago.
Today, at Mexico City's Botanical Garden botanists are reviving an
appreciation for this country's vast native plant life and its
nutritional and medicinal value. In addition to a huge collection
of agaves and cacti, the garden grows plants loaded with vitamins
or known to ease childbirth, stomach ailments and other troubles.
Workers at the garden often help themselves to leaves of one plant
to brew a tea that fights anemia. The garden is run by Mexico's
National Autonomous University, where researchers are also involved
in international projects to develop medicines to treat AIDS,
tuberculosis and other diseases -- research that combines high-tech
science with the knowledge of traditional healers. (Ferriss, Cox

   MILLENIUM-CHRISTIANITY _ ROME - On a sunny morning, the
distinctive dome of St. Peter's Basilica casts a shadow that
dominates the landscape below. Visitors climb hundreds of narrow,
curved stairs to the 435-foot cupola of the building for a
perspective of Rome. The shadowy shape adds symbolism to the scene.
This modern city _ where motorscooterists regard red lights as
suggestions, cellular telephones ring continually, and tourists
line up outside Gucci and Prada _ is defined by Catholicism. To
celebrate Easter, the holiest day of their year, tens of thousands
of Christians are here today to gather outside St. Peter's, the
home church of a billion Catholics. With the year 2000 only months
away, the festivities are a foretaste of what will take place here
as Christians hold a year-long birthday party. The setting is
appropriate. The history of the faith can be traced by a walk down
these narrow streets. (Gwhite, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 20.

   MIILLENIUM-VATICAN _ VATICAN CITY _ On the ancient gray-brown

seems to be a portrait of the world. This is ground zero for the
largest Christian denomination in the world, the center of a
separate ``country'' with its own government, newspaper, radio
station and publishing house, home to about 1,000 people. Decisions
made here have changed the course of Europe and the world. (Gwhite,

   MIILLENIUM-ORVIETO _ ORVIETO - You can see your breath in the
sanctuary of St. Andrew and St. Bartholomew Church on a drizzly
Saturday night during Lent. Half a dozen space heaters feebly try
to battle the chill of a temperature barely breaking the 30s as
older women, in wool or fur coats, gather on the hard, worn wooden
pews to pray the rosary. St. Andrew and St. Bartholomew is a
combined parish of about 400 families in the medieval part of this
hill town of 21,000 people in the region of Umbria about 90 minutes
from Rome. The church is one of hundreds of struggling
congregations off the usual path of tourists in Italy, the homeland
of Catholicism. Although some 80 percent Italians identify
themselves as Christian and virtually all are Catholic, Catholicism
is often more a matter of culture than of practice. (Gwhite,

   RELIGION-EASTER _ ``He has risen.'' Those three words, found in
the New Testament, mark the beginning of the Easter story. For some
Christians, the bodily resurrection of Jesus is hard to believe.
For them Easter symbolizes that Jesus' teachings, like Beethoven's
music, lives on after his death. Others insist, however, that Jesus
literally rose from the dead. We examine the view from both camps
and see how the faithful at oppostive ends of the spectrum find
meaning in Easter. (Blake, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

<P>
   SALVAGE _ Wrought iron gates with rust around the edges. Pine
doors with scratches from a dog. Fireplace mantels with peeling
layers of blue, yellow and white paint. Stained glass windows with
rippling rich-colored panes. These objects, once destined for the
junk yard, are being transformed into trendy garden accents, wall
hangings and furniture. Homeowners are rummaging through antique
stores, used building supply stores and flea markets to find the
perfect piece of history _ one that will give their homes a flavor
different from the high-tech, high-gloss, modern world they
inhabit. (Villalpando, Austin American-Statesman).

   SALVAGE _ Wrought iron gates with rust around the edges. Pine
doors with scratches from a dog. Fireplace mantels with peeling
layers of blue, yellow and white paint. Stained glass windows with
rippling rich-colored panes. These objects, once destined for the
junk yard, are being transformed into trendy garden accents, wall
hangings and furniture. Homeowners are rummaging through antique
stores, used building supply stores and flea markets to find the
perfect piece of history _ one that will give their homes a flavor
different from the high-tech, high-gloss, modern world they
inhabit. (Villalpando, Austin American-Statesman).

 &HT;    HEADLINE: Eggs-actly what was needed for Easter
 &HT;    FOR RELEASE APRIL 4, 1999
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Ana Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most people's Easter memories include boiled eggs; mine are over
easy.
</P>
<P>
   We were a large Catholic family blessed with Mexican heritage.
To us kids, the solemnity of Lent made Easter a much anticipated
time. We looked forward to it because we knew it was a time for
celebration and a time for great fun.
</P>
<P>
   It was time for cascarones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cascaron'' is the Spanish word for shell. Cascarones are dyed,
confetti filled egg shells we would crack over each other's head.
By the end of Easter Sunday, my long black hair would be glistening
with shiny bits of paper and egg shell. I'm sure my mother looked
so forward to shampooing it that evening.
</P>
<P>
   There's probably an explanation of this tradition somewhere but
I don't recall ever hearing it. Here's what I do remember.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning around Ash Wednesday, my sisters and I would
religiously begin collecting egg shells. At least one daily
collection opportunity existed: breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the usual whack in the middle of the egg, my mom
would carefully tap its narrow end against the frying pan. Her goal
was to make the opening large enough for the inside of the egg to
pass through but not so large that it wouldn't hold the confetti.
About 95 percent of the time, the yolk would catch a sharp edge,
and we would have scrambled eggs.
</P>
<P>
   I have nothing against scrambled eggs. In fact, my consumption
of all kinds of eggs has dropped considerably over the last several
years. But, like my dad and my siblings, I prefer mine over easy.
</P>
<P>
   After breakfast, as soon as we were old enough to handle the
delicate task, we helped wash the shells and left them to dry. Once
dry, we put them in egg cartons and placed those on the top pantry
shelf.
</P>
<P>
   We compared notes with neighborhood kids daily to see who had
collected the most, and demand for egg dishes rose sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Come Holy Saturday, we would make the dye for the boiled eggs
and for the cascarones. Meanwhile, one of us children would gather
a shoebox, scissors, crepe paper and leftover wrapping paper and
began snipping the colored paper into the smallest possible pieces.
Though it may sound tedious, it was rather soothing running the
scissors through the scraps and watching them become tinier and
tinier as they cascaded over your hand.
</P>
<P>
   Creating the glitter was a coveted task and usually a younger
sister would want to do it. We let her, but she would soon tire and
one of us older ones would sagely take over and complete the task,
being careful to reserve enough paper to make seals for the
cascarones.
</P>
<P>
   The seals were crepe paper circles which we glued to the
openings in the confetti filled shells. The ``glue'' was a
flour/water mixture applied with a toothpick.
</P>
<P>
   We then placed our finished creations back into the egg cartons
to dry overnight and await their Sunday morning fate.
</P>
<P>
   We still had to get through, I mean, attend Mass, but our
parents always consented to let us bring a portion of our treasures
along. The main arsenal had to be preserved for the egg hunt and
picnic that afternoon. Though the grown-ups never allowed us to
bring the cascarones into the sanctuary, we convinced them that no
kid worth her salt would come to Easter Mass unarmed. The egg
cartons waited in the car.
</P>
<P>
   After the service, mayhem reigned on the church grounds as we
kids chased each other and cascarones exploded like paper
fireworks. Soon, the church lawn bore its own colorful Easter garb.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, and for breakfast, we had eggs, over easy.

SO MANY PRODUCTS, SO FEW BUCKS FOR THEM IN `EDTV' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA MITCHELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Holy product placement!
</P>
<P>
   Moviegoers who caught ``EDtv'' during its opening weekend
couldn't help but notice the number of name-brand products featured
in the film.
</P>
<P>
   For those not familiar with the concept of ``EDtv,'' it's the
tale of Ed, a regular guy who agrees to let a cable TV channel
broadcast his life, 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Ed eats Pop Tarts for breakfast and drinks lots of Pepsi. His
girlfriend, Shari, delivers packages for UPS, wearing the company's
trademark brown uniform, of course. When Ed and Shari eventually
break up, there's a USA Today poll _ declaring Shari an unfit
girlfriend _ to thank.
</P>
<P>
   These are just a few of the name brands featured in Ed's
everyday life. Factor in the dozens of companies _ including
Calgon, Saturn, Maytag and Trojan _ who buy commercial time on the
live TV show, and who could blame moviegoers for assuming serious
cash was made from product placement?
</P>
<P>
   Director Ron Howard wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were going to get a lot of money out of this
product placement. I really did,'' Howard said during a recent
visit to Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't the case. Advertisers granted permission to use
their logos but wouldn't pay any placement fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wouldn't because of the satirical nature of the movie,''
Howard explained. ``Its irreverent edginess made them fear somehow
that their product would be in a movie that was a little too
controversial, that it may be used in a situation that might not do
the product credit. Or, they thought we might make fun of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lack of cash didn't keep Howard from using the products, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed real products. I wanted it to be as realistic as it
could be, so I wanted recognizable names. I don't want to make up a
name for a condom. I want Trojan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be a smart element in the movie, and I also
thought, we're going to offset our budget with this. I bet we can
raise a couple million bucks with this advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wound up being zippo. Well, it wasn't zippo because they
did give us the right to use their logos and that is giving
something. And I think we might have gotten a little money for the
Reebok plants, but not a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been hearing about this all my life and have never been
able to cash in on it. Maybe someday.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmm, Howard's next film is ``How the Grinch Stole Christmas.''
For his trip to Whoville, maybe the evil green one could drive a
Ford Explorer instead of a sleigh.

SAY CLEESE! LIFE IS NO DRAG FOR ACTOR JOHN CLEESE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Cleese is as British as they come. He was born in Somerset,
educated at Cambridge University _ where he earned a law degree _
and has a home in London.
</P>
<P>
   He's also a founding member of Britain's famed Monty Python
comedy troupe, for which he's played a slaughtering but apologetic
Sir Lancelot and a member of the Ministry of Silly Walks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this Brit who often plays twits has ties to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Cleese is married to the former Alyce Faye Eichelberger of Waco.
And his friend and co-star in ``The Out-of-Towners,'' opening this
weekend nationwide, is Waco-born Steve Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Martin plays an Ohio ad man in Manhattan with his wife (Goldie
Hawn) for a job interview. Everything goes wrong, from losing their
luggage to having their credit cards fail at a posh hotel.
</P>
<P>
   When they ask the cheerfully rude manager (Cleese) if he'll
throw them out, he replies, ``Good heavens, no! Security will take
care of that. Security!''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Cleese said the Waco link has come up
from time to time in the 10 years he and Martin have known each
other.
</P>
<P>
   Cleese met Alyce Faye, his third wife (who was once married to
pro golfer Dave Eichelberger of Waco) in 1987 in London _ on a
blind date.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was prescribed for me by my doctor,'' Cleese said. ``I
went to dinner with him, and he said there was a ravishing woman I
should meet, and it turned out to be true. We started going out
together soon after and married in '92.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he's ``not quite sure'' where they live.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a home in London that's occupied by builders now, and
a home in Santa Barbara (Calif.), and I've been traveling around
giving speeches, which I rather enjoy. So it's hard to say quite
where we're living.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleese tries to keep in touch with his mates from Monty Python.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see quite a lot of Michael Palin, since we're both based in
London, but I haven't seen much of Eric Idle since he moved to
L.A.,'' Cleese said.
</P>
<P>
   The funny fellows have been ``exploring'' the possibility of a
stage show, ``maybe for Vegas,'' Cleese said. ``But Eric doesn't
want to do it, and Terry Gilliam is more interested in directing
films than taking a minor part onstage.''
</P>
<P>
   The group does plan a fall reunion for a BBC special marking
Monty Python's 30th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're giving us four hours to be as silly and naughty as we
want,'' said Cleese, who thinks the show eventually will air on
PBS, where ``Monty Python's Flying Circus'' first appeared on
American telly in 1974. The TV series was followed by several movie
spin-offs, including ``Monty Python and the Holy Grail.''
</P>
<P>
   That twisted tale of knights and shrubbery was made 25 years
ago, and Cleese still loves it, ``except for about 15 minutes in
the middle that I don't think is very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleese can be his own worst critic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, if you write a funny line for a film, there will
be only six times you think it's funny in two years,'' said Cleese,
whose screenwriting credits include 1988's ``A Fish Called Wanda.''
</P>
<P>
   Such occasions arise during writing, rehearsals, filming ``and
when you finally show it to an audience,'' Cleese said.
</P>
<P>
   Cleese reunited with ``Wanda'' co-stars Kevin Kline and Jamie
Lee Curtis for 1997's ``Fierce Creatures,'' a comedy about a
failing London zoo, which he also wrote. It didn't click, earning
$9 million in America, compared to $63 million for ``Wanda.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a mistake to make ''Fierce Creatures`` with
Kevin and Jamie Lee,'' Cleese said. ``I think if I'd done it with
different people, it would have been accepted for what it was,
which was not ''A Fish Called Wanda.`` It would have been perceived
as a different movie _ broader and also warmer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Out-of-Towners'' remakes a 1970 film with Jack Lemmon and
Sandy Dennis. But Cleese had never heard of the Neil Simon comedy,
so for him this new adaptation (by Marc Lawrence) was a fresh
start.
</P>
<P>
   Cleese hadn't starred with Martin before, and he'd never even
met Hawn ``until I was on the set with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet I felt very comfortable, because I really liked the
script, I knew Steve, Goldie is such a doll, and I'd worked with
the director (Sam Weisman) on other things, including when I did
the voice of an ape for ''George of the Jungle.''
</P>
<P>
   While filming ``The Out-of-Towners'' _ mostly on L.A. sound
stages _ Weisman often laughed during takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually you'd kill anyone who did that on a set,'' Cleese
said. ``But when it's the director cheering you on, you just say,
`Well, you're right _ it's funny.' And of course you can always
loop a line (re-record it in post-production) without having to
abandon the whole take.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleese stresses that his new role as Mersault differs from the
late-'70s British sitcom ``Fawlty Towers,'' in which he played
Basil, manager of a small English country hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mersault is totally different,'' Cleese said. ``Unlike Basil,
he's very international, totally sophisticated, obviously has seen
it all and doesn't get rattled. He also can be quite charming when
he knows you have money. But if you don't, he's a complete
bastard.''
</P>
<P>
   Mersault's secret is dressing in drag _ as Cleese often did in
his Python days. In one scene, the hotelier dances in a fur coat
and 4-inch high heels with a flower in his teeth.
</P>
<P>
   For the dancing, Cleese had a stunt double who was only 2 inches
shorter than his 6-foot-4 height.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, he was ``genuinely anxious'' that he might twist an
ankle in the rest of the scene. ``If I had, what do you do?
Postpone shooting for three months, I suppose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done some athletic moves in my time, such as the Ministry
of Silly Walks,'' Cleese said. ``But I'm turning 60 this year, and
I don't think I can do that kind of thing anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally Cleese finds filming ``tedious'' and doesn't enjoy
``any part of it _ drag in particular.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet after finishing his ``Out-of-Towners'' drag scene, ``I have
to say it was one of the most pleasant productions I've ever worked
on,'' Cleese said. ``There was so much comedy know-how on the set,
and working with a good group like that can be quite joyous.''
</P>
<P>
   He has done no writing since ``Fierce Creatures,'' except his
humorous speeches, and now he won't have time. ``I'll be busy in
the next few months getting my finances in order. It's time for my
pension.''
</P>
<P>
   He also realizes that, ``the way this business is structured _
which is insane _ I could probably make 20 times more by acting in
a movie than writing one.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleese's acting has included the films ``Silverado,'' ``The
Great Muppet Caper,'' ``Time Bandits'' and Idle's ``Splitting
Heirs.'' In the can is the animated The Magic Pudding, for which he
supplies a voice.
</P>
<P>
   Now if only Cleese's wife would see his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``She does think I'm pretty funny,'' he said. ``But she hasn't
seen many of my movies, actually. Apparently she loves me for who I
am, not who I play.''
</P>

WAYS TO WORK AROUND WINDOWS DESIGN FLAW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I recently had a close call. I installed an older program
that overwrote a crucial Windows 98 file in the windowssystem
folder. When I tried to start my computer the next time, Windows
locked up. When I called technical support for the maker of that
program, they knew what was wrong and told me I should reinstall
Windows _ or get the Windows 98 copy of the file that had been
replaced. Fortunately, I had another computer in the house with
Windows 98 and just copied the file. But is there any way I can
avoid this in the future?
</P>
<P>
   A: One of the major flaws in the design of Windows is that it
does little to prevent older programs from placing outdated system
files on your hard drive. Usually this is not a major problem, but
occasionally users will run into the kind of problem you
experienced.
</P>
<P>
   One way to avoid the problem is to update to the latest versions
of your Windows software. Newer install routines often check the
dates of files being replaced, and you get a message that says
something like: ``This program is about to replace a file that's
older than the file currently on your system. Would you like to
keep your file?'' When you see this, always keep that file!
</P>
<P>
   If your system is functional when you've overwritten a system
file, Windows 98 provides a way to restore the file. The System
Information Tool (in the Accessories/System Tools folder) called
the System File Checker. It will make sure you have the proper
files. It also lets you extract a single file from the Windows 98
CD and put it back into the system folder.
</P>
<P>
   You might also find the file you need in the windowssysbkup,
which stores certain crucial components of Windows. Simply copy
what you need to the appropriate folder.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Internet Explorer 5 is great, but there is one feature that I
really dislike. Whenever I type a Web address into the address
field, a drop-down box appears with suggested URLs. Is there a way
to turn this off?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sure. Right-click on the Internet Explorer icon and choose
Properties, then click on the Advanced tab. Scroll down until you
see ``Use inline Auto-Complete for Web addresses,'' and uncheck
that box. Click OK.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have been shopping for a new computer and have decided to
get a DVD drive in it, but I don't understand the pros and cons of
getting a drive with its own controller card, vs. one that controls
the drive with software. Can you talk about the trade-offs?
</P>
<P>
   A: A DVD drive requires either a hardware or software component
to decode what's found on a DVD disk into video. This is handled
one of two ways _ through a software program or an add-on card
that's inserted into a PCI slot.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the hardware configuration is going to be more robust
_ video quality will be somewhat better and playback smoother.
However, the card will occupy a free slot, which may be an issue if
you have lots of other devices added to your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Software decoding actually works fairly well, particularly in a
high-end computer. If you end up buying a PC with a processor
that's 400 megahertz or faster, software should be more than
adequate. However, if you plan on having a lot of other things
going on at the same you watch DVD video, you could experience some
jerkiness.

RIO, MP3s DELIVER TUNES FOR OUR TIMES 
 
By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the last couple of years, prognosticators have been saying
that simple Internet appliances would eventually do away with most
folks' need for a personal computer. Why put up with the
inefficiencies, cost and complexity of a PC when you can have all
the power you need in the palm of your hand?
</P>
<P>
   However, so far it appears that reports of the PC's death have
been greatly exaggerated. Internet appliances are few and far
between, and those that have made it to market are not
mega-sellers.
</P>
<P>
   That is, with one fascinating and surprising exception: the Rio.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of Internet appliances usually tout e-mail, Web
surfing _ even online phone calls. But who would have thought that
the first really popular Net appliance would have been something
you use to listen to music?
</P>
<P>
   Diamond Multimedia's Rio PMP300 allows you to store tunes that
you download from the Internet, or copy from compact disks. It uses
a format known as MP3, which creates music files that are highly
compressed and are of reasonable quality. Although true audiophiles
may turn their noses up at MP3s, the sound is likely to please most
listeners.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MUSIC INDUSTRY SOUNDS ALARMS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both MP3 and the Rio have given the traditional music industry
fits, and are illustrative of the oft-quoted pronouncement that
``the Internet changes everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The big recording companies are alarmed at the explosive
popularity of MP3s because it undermines their control of music
distribution. Suddenly, thousands of previously unknown bands and
individual artists can get their work heard worldwide merely by
submitting MP3 files to Web sites such as MP3.com. This also means
that musicians who don't fit an easily defined commercial mold can
get a global hearing, even if they're not considered commercially
viable enough to land a recording contract.
</P>
<P>
   The industry also is concerned about piracy _ it's easy to
convert a CD track into an MP3 file, though the sound quality isn't
as good.
</P>
<P>
   The recording companies are attempting to come up with their
own, alternative music file format that will, in some way, prevent
piracy. But I suspect it'll be too little, too late _ the genie is
out of the bottle with MP3, and there's no stuffing him back in.
</P>
<P>
   If MP3 makes the music moguls nervous, then the Rio has given
them convulsions. They tried unsuccessfully in court to stop
Diamond from distributing it, arguing it would encourage piracy.
But Diamond correctly argued that, because the Rio only downloads
music and doesn't upload it to another PC, that piracy is not even
an issue.
</P>
<P>
   Although Diamond won with this argument, amateur, independent
software programmers have now produced programs that let you move
MP3 files out of a Rio and onto a PC's hard drive. Whether the
recording industry will take another legal run at the Rio as a
result is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
QUALITY PLAYS IMPORTANT ROLE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I've been playing with a Rio for several weeks, and I understand
all the fuss. This is a pretty cool gadget, if a little expensive.
It has a list price of about $200 _ it needs to sell for half that
or less in order to be a true mass-market device. It also needs
simpler software.
</P>
<P>
   The Rio's black, plastic case is slightly smaller than a pack of
cigarettes, yet it has all the functions you'd find on a portable
compact disk player _ play, stop, fast forward, rewind, random play
and so on.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of storing music on disk or tape, it holds MP3 files
in 32 megabytes of computer memory. You can also insert the small
Flash Media cards that are used to hold pictures in some digital
cameras for extra storage.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, you can hold up to an hour's worth of music, but that
really depends on the quality of the MP3 files. When you record an
MP3, you can vary the amount of compression _ the more compression,
the more you lose in sound quality. At the full 60 minutes, most
music sounds like a decent-quality FM radio. If you decrease the
compression, it sounds more like a good portable tape player.
</P>
<P>
   It comes with headphones that are actually tiny speakers you jam
into your ears. It's a little uncomfortable, but I got used to it
after a while. The sound is not bad, but you can always replace
them with a more traditional headset.
</P>
<P>
   To connect the Rio to your Windows 95/98 PC, just plug the
accompanying adapter into your parallel port _ it has a
pass-through for your printer _ and then plug the Rio into the
adapter. I found the adapter conflicted with some other devices
that use the parallel port, such as an external, re-writable CD-ROM
drive I was testing.
</P>
<P>
   The Rio comes with software that lets you convert CD tracks to
MP3 files, as well as organize MP3 files into play lists. However,
this software is separate from the program you use to transfer the
tunes into the Rio.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Rio's software is its weakest component. I found it
confusing to use, with too many small windows. To use it, you first
must create a play list in one window, then copy the list,
file-by-file, into another window that represents the Rio's memory.
It can be complicated further if you are working with CD-based
music, which must be converted.
</P>
<P>
   This should all be one step _ I'd like to copy a CD tune
directly into the Rio, with the MP3 conversion process rendered
transparent. Or, how about a browser plug-in that can transfer a
file right from an MP3 Web site into the Rio.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, I suspect we'll see all this, and in similar
devices that cost much less _ in the $30-$40 price range. But for
now, the Rio gives a nifty glance into the intriguing future of
music.

GIULIANI'S TOUGH CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ I really didn't expect New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani to say much about the Amadou Diallo killing. It's the
worst crisis of his administration _ seven straight weeks of daily
demonstrations at New York City police headquarters, more than
1,700 people arrested so far, including many bigtime New York City
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's poll numbers among both whites and non-whites have
dipped into the basement.
</P>
<P>
   If he did say anything significant on the topic, though, I
wanted to be there. So I went to Hudson Valley Community College
the other night to see Giuliani before he delivered his speech at
the annual dinner of the Rensselaer County Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``These cops have been indicted on second-degree murder charges
in this case,'' I said to him. ``As a former prosecutor, do you
think that's an appropriate charge? Do you see any indication of
premeditation in Mr. Diallo's death?''
</P>
<P>
   I won't try this case in the press, Giuliani responded. I don't
want anybody tried in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, though, that's where this disaster is being tried.
And it's not just the four New York City police officers who blew
away Diallo who are on trial. The entire department of 40,000 men
and women are under ferocious attack. So is Giuliani. In case
you've somehow missed all this, an immigrant from Guinea named
Amadou Diallo was standing in the vestibule of a building in the
Bronx around midnight on Feb. 4. Four members of the New York City
Police Department's Street Crime Unit happened by. They were
looking for a serial rapist in a neighborhood where guns are not
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   According to the New York Post _ recounting a version that seems
to have come from one or more of the cops' lawyers or, possibly,
from the police union _ the officers approached the stoop of the
building wearing badges around their necks. The Post gave this
account: One officer had his pistol unholstered, pointed at the
sidewalk. They told Diallo they were cops and ordered him to,
``Hold it. Stay there.''
</P>
<P>
   Diallo turned and tried to enter the building. The police
ordered him to come out and show his hands. When he couldn't open
the door, he turned to his left and reached into his pocket. He
began to pull something black from the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   One cop shouted, ``Gun! He's got a gun!''
</P>
<P>
   The officer who had his gun in hand fired at Diallo three times.
In police vernacular, he ``triple-tapped.'' Then the cop who'd
fired stepped back and fell off the stoop onto his back on the
sidewalk. The other police officers, hearing the cry that Diallo
was armed, hearing the shots and seeing their comrade fall,
immediately drew and fired.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 41 police bullets flew into that vestibule. Nineteen
hit Diallo. The gun he supposedly had reached for turned out to be
a wallet. He wasn't the rapist they were after. He was, in fact, as
clean as a whistle.
</P>
<P>
   New York City is in a frenzied uproar over this. Part of what's
happening is a concerted effort by Guiliani's political enemies to
drive him from office or, failing that, to wound him grievously in
advance of the U.S. Senate run he would like to make next year.
</P>
<P>
   Part of this, however, is legitimate concern over the conduct of
the Street Crime Unit, a largely white force that works mostly in
minority neighborhoods in a huge city that's less than half white.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's cops, and primarily this unit, have adopted
aggressive crime-fighting methods. They've made stop-and-frisk
procedures the centerpiece of their tactics. In the last two years,
this unit has stopped and frisked 40,000 New Yorkers. They've found
grounds to arrest fewer than one in four of them.
</P>
<P>
   The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires
cops to stop and frisk only when they have a ``reasonable
suspicion'' _ one they can clearly articulate _ that a crime has
taken place or is about to take place. That legal nicety seems
largely ignored in New York City. Last year, roughly half the
felony gun cases brought to court in Manhattan were deemed
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Street Crime Unit members sport T-shirts proclaiming that, ``We
Own the Night!'' Overwhelmingly, they're young and more courageous
than experienced.
</P>
<P>
   The flip side is this: It works.
</P>
<P>
   The year before Giuliani became mayor, 2,200 New Yorkers were
murdered. Last year, New York had 600 murders _ fewer than Chicago,
with only one-third New York's population. Stranger murders, in
particular, are down. Bad guys who carry guns and kill on impulse
aren't carrying and killing the way they used to _ not with all
that stopping and frisking taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Also, statistics indicate that New York City's cops are not
trigger happy. Last year, they had a fatal shooting rate that was
only two-thirds that of Philadelphia's cops. It was half the rate
of the Dallas police, one-fourth the rate of Miami's and less than
one-sixth that of Washington's.
</P>
<P>
   From a public policy standpoint, the question is whether the
police can effectively deter crime with such tactics without the
collateral damage of an occasional Amadou Diallo. What's the
acceptable number of dead, innocent men required to maintain tight
police control over public spaces?
</P>
<P>
   The political question is whether this mayor, a term-limited
politician with obvious ambitions, is willing to moderate those
policies and see the violent crime rise in his city. It was not a
question that Giuliani was prepared to answer the other night at
Hudson Valley Community College.
</P>
<P>
   But it had to be pretty much all he was thinking about.

HOPING FOR A `SOUTH PARK' COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, April 5)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a tale of two toons, one embarking on a very promising
start, another that may have already peaked after just two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has such high hopes for ``Family Guy'' that it has slotted
it in the coveted 8:30 p.m. EST slot Sunday after ``The Simpsons''
starting this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Over on Comedy Central, ``South Park,'' which had one of the
greatest rookie seasons on record, tries to rebound from a
disappointing second year, starting with its third-season premiere
at 10 p.m. EST Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   First, let's go through the cultural references in the second
episode of the ``Family Guy,'' which returns to Fox after more than
a two-month absence following its post-Super Bowl debut:
</P>
<P>
   ``Sesame Street.'' The Wright Brothers. Driver's test. ``Star
Trek.'' William Shatner's overacting. The Road Runner and Wile E.
Coyote. The Amish. ``CHiPs.'' Fox reality shows (``Fast Animals,
Slow Children''). Rosie O'Donnell. Addiction to television.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, no, we are just getting started ... Bigfoot. Sneaking into
R-rated movies. The Vietnam War. Vacuous television anchors. See 'N
Says. AOL chat rooms. ``Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.''
Dennis Franz's butt. James Woods. PBS. ``The Wonder Years.''
``Scooby Doo.'' ``The Wizard of Oz.'' ``Alf.'' ``Gilligan's
Island.'' ``Lost in Space.'' ``I Dream of Jeannie.'' ``Bewitched.''
Lifetime, CBS, UPN and Fox networks. ``Beverly Hills: 90210.''We're
in the homestretch ... Charles Manson. NBC reruns. Old Raisin Bran
commercials. ``Batman.'' Adolf Hitler's invasion of Poland and
takeover of Czechoslovakia. William Shatner's overacting. The
``Star Trek'' landing team guy in the red shirt always getting
killed. William Shatner's overacting. William Shatner's hairpiece.
William Shatner's gut. Klondike Bar commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Feel free to exhale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family Guy,'' from the mind of 25-year-old Seth McFarlane,
chronicles the Griffins of Rhode Island. Dad is a lovable buffoon
in the Ralph Kramden/Fred Flintstone tradition. His wife, Lois, is
the moral center, as is the pet dog, Brian.
</P>
<P>
   High-schooler Meg and younger brother Chris try to get noticed,
while infant Stewie, the genius with the British accent (but
understood only by the show's viewers), is trying to take over the
world and make it safe from broccoli.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, open up for the airplane,'' mom says.``Never! Damn
broccoli,'' Stewie shouts. ``Damn you. And damn the Wright
brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   You will think of ``Airplane,'' watching this show. Don't laugh
too hard; you'll miss three or four lines. Guarantee at least two
or three will be good. Then there is ``South Park,'' the story of
four coarse little kids from Colorado, one of whom dies in every
episode.
</P>
<P>
   The show returns with Kyle, Kenny, Stan and Eric being placed in
an Up With People-style choir, ``Getting Gay with Kids,'' who
travel to Costa Rica to help save the rain forest. They are led by
a hippie music teacher (guest star Jennifer Aniston of
``Friends''), who soon develops a different take on nature.
</P>
<P>
   The episode is good. Not great, not even close, and certainly
not up to the stellar standards set in the first season. And
``South Park'' has been that way for a while.
</P>
<P>
   In sports, there is an expression called ``The Sophomore Jinx.''
It's an axiom that applies to a player who had a great rookie year,
but stumbled in his second. Some players recover from the sophomore
jinx, others don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Park: The Movie'' is slated to come out in June. Before
then, I would like to see ``South Park,'' the series, make a
comeback.

CARELESS ASSERTIONS ABOUT `CASUAL ABORTIONS' 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In an impressive leap of logic on the Wall
Street Journal's opinion page, a Washington, D.C., writer named
Lorena Rodrigues Bottum made the following declaration:
</P>
<P>
   ``So long as abortion is legal, it will be neither an agonizing
decision nor a rare one.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottum based this grotesque conclusion on two things:
</P>
<P>
   _ A single conversation with two unidentified neighbors, in
which both ``casually discuss their multiple casual abortions with
a stranger.''
</P>
<P>
   _ An erroneous account of Monica Lewinsky's admission to Barbara
Walters that she had an abortion while working at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Someone who didn't watch the Walters program would have to take
Bottum's word for it that Lewinsky ``casually mentioned'' the
abortion and, ``like the rest of her conduct, it was nothing she
was ashamed of.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone who did watch must wonder at the quality of Bottum's
cable reception. A dark look passed over Lewinsky's face when
Walters brought up the abortion. Then she nodded and said only that
it was ``a very sensitive subject.'' In a voice-over Walters said
that Lewinsky ``was clearly uncomfortable'' talking about it.
</P>
<P>
   So who knows about the accuracy of Bottum's chat with her
neighbors?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe one woman really did say she'd feared she was pregnant and
would have to have ``another abortion ... right in the middle of
packing'' for a move to Africa. And maybe the other woman really
did commiserate by saying: ``Oh, I know. It's so expensive and you
feel sick for days afterwards.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, from this single exchange _ and the skewed Lewinsky
account _ Bottum indicted all of ``modern America'' and ``the
current abortion situation'' for turning ``good, ordinary people''
into abject moral failures. Nothing short of a return to illegal
back alley abortions, she intimated, would drive home the gravity
of our deeds.
</P>
<P>
   Given the fact that some 1.3 million legal abortions are
performed each year in the United States, I would never presume to
characterize the attitude of all or even the majority of the women
who have them. Women being people, it's safe to say that their
attitudes vary and probably run the gamut from blase to
grief-consumed.
</P>
<P>
   What I can say since Bottum is so comfy with anecdotal evidence
is this: In the 26 years since Roe vs. Wade made abortion a
constitutionally protected issue of privacy, I have never heard a
single woman make a joke about her abortion. On the other hand, I
have seen a lot of women cry about having the procedure _ some,
many years after.
</P>
<P>
   I have heard a few women, usually unmarried and in their early
20s, harp upon the physical pain, expense and inconvenience of an
abortion. But I have heard many more women speak thoughtfully and
sadly _ not in regret for the choice they made but in regret for
ever needing to make a choice.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, in my experience, most women do not appear to
take abortion casually. Whether each ``agonized'' over her
decision, I don't know. I know that the women who have been closest
to me agonized aplenty.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week in San Francisco, the National Abortion Rights
Action League held its annual Power of Choice luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   The group's president, Kate Michelman, spoke at length about
people like Lorena Rodrigues Bottum _ people who want abortion to
once again be illegal and thus unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   By ``keeping the act of abortion, not the issue of privacy''
before the country's eyes, said Michelman, such people intend to
``deny and shame women in need'' and to ``spread ambivalence
throughout America.''
</P>
<P>
   If some of them have to do it with skewed truths and whopping
over-generalizations as Bottum did, so be it. They have a dream,
you see: To once again live in a nation where a woman has but two
choices _ to bear an unwanted child or find the right alley.

`THE SOPRANOS' TAKES AN INTERMISSION, AND IT'S MUCH TOO LONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call ``The Sopranos'' the best new show on television if you
want. You would be right, of course, but still off-base.
</P>
<P>
   No, ``The Sopranos'' is the best show on television, period. And
if you don't like it, I'll send Silvio, Paulie Walnuts and the rest
of Tony's crew over for a little talk.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's not even close, which says more about this
exhilarating drama than it does about the rest of television. ``The
Sopranos'' is a movie a week, better than any movie-of-the-week,
fueled by writing the quality of which is rarely seen in a weekly
series.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, it all wraps up (9 p.m. EST, HBO), a 13-week run that
began in January. If you think the first 12 left you stunned, be
ready to force your jaw back into joint when it falls to the floor.
The funny thing is, after watching Sunday's episode a fan will be
left with an empty feeling, a hunger, only because they know they
can't get a new fix next week. In fact, you will have to wait until
next January for new installments (the 13-episode season will be
rerun, in order, on Wednesdays at 9 p.m. beginning June 9). It
hurts.
</P>
<P>
   It's that good. Even those who don't subscribe to HBO have
gotten caught up in the show, trading tapes like Grateful
Deadheads. The appeal stems in part from the show's ability to turn
from comedy to violence to a skewed version of the ``The Waltons''
faster than a foot soldier can pull a gun from his ankle holster.
It's short of glorifying the Mafia, but certainly strikes a chord
of empathy that leaves people rooting for the boss, even as he is
snuffing a rival.
</P>
<P>
   For those playing catch-up: ``The Sopranos'' chronicles the life
of Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini), the power behind the North
Jersey mob. Sure, he is not above the stray shooting or strangling
for business purposes, but he has feelings, too. To deal with his
mounting pressures from The Family and his family, not to mention a
complicated childhood, Tony goes off to see a shrink (Lorraine
Bracco). The results are both therapeutic and lethal. Already,
devotees talk of episodes the way ``Sopranos'' characters talk of
the ``Godfather'' installments. Did you see in ``4'' when Anthony
Jr. figured out about what his dad does for a living? Oh yeah, what
about ``9'' and that secret Uncle Junior wants to keep? Sure, but
nothing beats ``5.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahh, ``5,'' officially titled ``College,'' when daughter Meadow
Soprano (Jamie Lynn Sigler) and doting dad Tony Soprano go off to
Maine to tour colleges. Unfortunately, he runs into an old mob
stoolie, so while daughter is meeting with college counselors dad
is introducing the rat to a dirt nap.
</P>
<P>
   It was in this episode that dad is also confronted with his
daughter's knowledge that he is not just in ``waste management.''
It is an uncomfortable moment, and the signature of this series:
The delicate balance between a man who genuinely cares for his
family, friends even ducks but is more than willing to kill.
</P>
<P>
   In short, ``The Sopranos'' works on every level, but here are
some particularly key components to its artistic and commercial
success:
</P>
<P>
   _ It's not (network) TV. It's HBO: The show was shopped to the
networks, which passed. Good thing, since even on Fox ``The
Sopranos'' could not have realized its full potential. While the
violence and nudity (at times, yes, excessive) would never fly on
the nets, it is the profane dialogue that is intrinsic, giving the
show a good deal of its atmosphere and dramatic shading.
</P>
<P>
   _ Location, location, location: You know if, say, ABC was making
this show, it would be shot on some back lot outside of Hollywood.
For HBO, the show is filmed on location in North Jersey. It is fun
to pick out Jersey haunts, like Paterson Falls. And you can't
replicate that Manhattan skyline.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mommie dearest: Nancy Marchand, as matriarch Livia Soprano, is
the character that has fans talking the most. She is either simply
the most overbearing, manipulative, nasty mother-from-hell you ever
came across, or simply pure evil. You make the call.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fat, bald and a sex symbol: One thing is for sure _ Gandolfini
never would have gotten the nod to play the lead if this were on
the networks. But given the role, his menacing presence grandly
offsets his bouts of vulnerability; at times he is a hulking shell
through which you could hear wind whistle. Men want to be him.
Women want to coddle him, or more.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the level of writing gets Shakespearean, as Tony's
business and family interests collide. It's a tragedy in the
making.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God,'' Dr. Melfi says. ``People are going to get
murdered, aren't they?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry about those distractions,'' Tony Soprano says,
dismissing her concerns as Archie Bunker would Edith's. ``Keep your
eye on the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos'' has all year. After Sunday comes the hard part:
Getting through the off-season.

PRESSURE MOUNTS FOR US TO COMMIT GROUND TROOPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   It is the last thing President Clinton wants to announce to the
American public. But soon he may have no choice: Sending the
Marines into Kosovo may be his only way to salvage Operation Allied
Force.
</P>
<P>
   With Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic unfazed after 10 days of
NATO bombing raids, and the Serbian military and paramilitary
groups continuing to drive out Kosovo's Albanians, more and more
military analysts are calling the administration's Balkan strategy
a failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are losing the war,'' Senator Richard Lugar, Republican of
Indiana and a leading voice on foreign policy, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lugar is one of many policy makers beginning to concur with
strategic planners who have warned for weeks that ground troops
must be part of an effective NATO campaign in Kosovo. Although
Clinton has given no indication that he has changed his mind on
using ground forces, which he maintains he has ``no intention'' of
employing, events unfolding in the Balkans may force his hand.
</P>
<P>
   The torrent of refugees, reports of the unabated Serb
terrorizing of ethnic Albanians, the capture of three US servicemen
on the Macedonian border, and the rapid depletion of the US cruise
missile inventory _ all make the NATO air operation look like an
expensive, noisy show with little effect on Serb actions.
</P>
<P>
   But how to launch a ground war without organizing a Desert
Storm-type operation, without putting 200,000 NATO troops into
position to invade?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I keep hearing out of the Pentagon,'' said Richard
Shultz, a specialist on military affairs at Tufts University's
Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. ``But I don't take it
seriously. That's the Pentagon putting out a number so high that
anyone in his right mind would say it's not worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   A much smaller force, Shultz says, could do the job. He believes
that 20,000 to 40,000 NATO soldiers could do the job. Under cover
of tactical air support _ including A-10 Thunderbolts and AH-64
Apache helicopters, both of which could neutralize Yugoslav Army
tanks _ a NATO force of this size could easily outmatch the 20,000
Yugoslav troops in Kosovo, and the 20,000 just inside Serbia
proper, he says.
</P>
<P>
   As with virtually all NATO missions, US troops would constitute
the bulk of the operation, which most likely would be spearheaded
by a Marine air-ground task force based on Navy vessels in the
Adriatic Sea and quickly bolstered by the 82nd Airborne Division
based at Fort Bragg, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   A modest aim would be to establish an enclave inside southern
Kosovo to protect refugees and possibly to mount a counterattack on
the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Such a ``safe-haven'' would work on two levels, practical and
political, argues Lawrence Korb, a former assistant secretary of
defense and member of the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.
</P>
<P>
   While he does not think the Clinton administration has ``enough
credibility'' at home or with its allies to muster a massive ground
invasion in Kosovo, Korb calls an enclave strategy ``something that
would keep folks alive and have the merit of looking like we were
doing something.''
</P>
<P>
   That second point _ political face-saving _ may yet become the
biggest reason for Clinton to send in troops. Neither the White
House, the Pentagon, nor NATO can risk losing a war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're coming up to NATO's 50th anniversary,'' Shultz said.
``It would be a rather somber celebration if Milosevic has emptied
out Kosovo and decapitated the elites of the province. What are we
going to celebrate? This is the kind of concern that says to me
that we are in a new environment where new options are going to be
considered.''
</P>
<P>
   What worries Pentagon planners and the White House is that there
are even more variables in a ground war than an air war. US
soldiers could become targets for Serb attacks, especially with
Serbs fighting on their home territory. NATO forces could get
caught up in a hit-and-run war between the Serb military and the
Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a NATO-patrolled enclave of ethnic Albanians might play
right into Milosevic's hands, allowing him to drive the rest of the
Albanians into refugee camps in southern Kosovo while he makes
northern Kosovo an ``ethnically-clean,'' Serb-only province. Then
he could call the Russian Prime Minister, Yevgeny Primakov, back to
Belgrade and sue for peace.
</P>
<P>
   For those in the administration who continue to oppose the use
of ground troops, it is this last scenario that may become their
strongest ammunition.

ANTI-NATO PATRIOTISM TURNS INTO TAX QUEST IN RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As Russians rally around their leaders' protest of the
NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, the cash-strapped government is trying
to take advantage of the newly patriotic mood to get its citizens
to do something they have never done with much gusto: pay their
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you love Russia?'' begins a televised ad, part of a
campaign that has swept the country in advance of Thursday's
deadline for Russians to file their 1998 tax declarations.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one will help us but we ourselves,'' declares a billboard
plastered all over Moscow and other cities in an effort to stem
rampant tax evasion that the government says has resulted in $6.9
billion in unpaid back taxes and crippled its efforts to run the
country.
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday, Georgy Boos, the federal tax minister, told
Russians that their tax rubles would go to support the country's
armed forces, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``A strong military is especially necessary when those events in
the Balkans are going on,'' Boos (pronounced Boss) said on Ekho
Moskvy radio.
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate that Moscow's harsh condemnation of the NATO
bombing of the Serbs _ Russia's traditional allies and fellow
Orthodox Christian Slavs _ has finally given Russians a reason to
be proud of their government.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, that surge of good feeling does not extend to the belief
that the Kremlin will do the right thing with tax money. Most
people fear that corrupt officials will steal or squander it. Ask a
Russian if he pays his taxes, and chances are the answer will be,
``Are you crazy?''
</P>
<P>
   Far more expressive of this mood than any billboard is the joke
about the Russian taxpayer who goes to see his psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you say you pay taxes regularly,'' says the shrink. ``Tell
me, when did this begin?''
</P>
<P>
   There has been plenty to back up this cynicism. After last
summer's financial collapse, many Russians saw their savings frozen
in insolvent banks amid rumors that government officials made huge
profits from the crisis and that banks sent huge amounts of dollars
to foreign accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were charges leveled in February by Russia's
prosecutor's office that the Central Bank managed the country's
hard currency reserves in a Channel Islands offshore company from
1993 to 1997. The investigation is a state secret, but some
legislators have produced documents showing that some of the money
was invested in Russian government securities _ indicating that
Central Bank officials were making profits by betting against the
ruble.
</P>
<P>
   And if there is a Russian who is happy that NATO is bombing
Yugoslavia, it is President Boris N. Yeltsin, who was facing
numerous charges of corruption among his family members and inner
circle before the Balkan crisis distracted public attention.
</P>
<P>
   Boos's ad campaign has centered on appeals to the statesman in
every Russian, showing poor pensioners, run-down schools, and
broken down ambulances, things that could be fixed if people paid
their taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But the ads miss the point, said Scott Antel, a partner in the
Moscow office of the Arthur Andersen accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rusian people are ashamed about taxes,'' Antel said. ``They
want schools and ambulances and pensions. They're just convinced
the money won't go there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no faith in the state. People don't believe that if
they pay the money it will go to the right place.''
</P>
<P>
   Boos said he expects 6 million Russians to file declarations, an
increase of over 2 million from last year, and the highest number
since Russia began requiring citizens to file their taxes in 1992.
Boos hailed the increase as ``a sign that the country is acquiring
a tax culture.'' But that number is low in a country of 145
million, even in a system in which most people with one source of
income are not required to file declarations.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates vary on the amount, but economists agree that much of
Russian business is conducted in a shadow economy where receipts
are faked, deals are done in cash or barter, and the profits end up
under someone's mattress.
</P>
<P>
   ``People do the sensible thing and go underground,'' Antel said.
</P>
<P>
   The government says it has tried a number of ways to get people
to pay up. It started a hot line in 1995 so that Russians can drop
a dime on neighbors whom they suspect of making more money than
they declare. The tipster is promised a reward of 10 percent what
the tax cheat owes. There's been one catch, which probably explains
why this tactic is not more popular: The government rarely has
enough money to pay the reward.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin has tried to raise tax revenue by writing letters to
schoolchildren to ask them to tell their parents to pay taxes. This
Big Brother approach has been highlighted by more billboards (``Are
you SURE you haven't forgotten anything''), and television ads
featuring a man who is too worried about his taxes to think about
sex.
</P>
<P>
   The government has also gone the heavy-handed route _ having
heavily armed Tax Police come crash through doors, arrest
entrepreneurs, and ransack their documents.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that most of the back taxes are owed by
companies, such as the gas and electricity monopolies, which
themselves are owed billions by their biggest client, the Russian
government.
</P>
<P>
   As for smaller businesses, they often have to pay protection
rackets and have little left over for taxes. But most Russians have
had a lifetime of practice in dealing with their government's
forceful methods. Each year, there is some new trick that lets
taxpayers get away with paying much less than they owe.
</P>
<P>
   This year's scam is an update of the old Soviet joke about how
workers pretend to work and the state pretends to pay them: The
taxpayers pretend to pay and the state pretends to collect the
money.
</P>
<P>
   A loophole in Russian law lets people pay taxes out of millions
of dollars in accounts that were frozen in last August's financial
collapse. All a taxpayer needs to do is show that he had money in a
bank and that he had requested the bank to make a transfer.
According to a ruling by Russia's highest court last October, the
money does not have to arrive in the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   Because many Russian banks continue to operate even after they
have stopped paying depositors' their money, the tactic continues.
Businesses trade their debts to other firms who need to pay taxes
in return for cash payments.
</P>
<P>
   Boos last month estimated that $933 million in tax payments have
been made from frozen accounts with money that will never arrive.
His deputy, Sergei Shulgin, put the amount at closer to $5 billion.
That is a sizeable chunk of revenue for the country's $23.5 billion
budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a form of thievery, but it is allowed because of the
lack of regulation,'' said Nikolai Gonchar, who sits on the budget
committee of the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian
parliament. ``In the current system, it is possible to steal
without punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Duma recently responded to the tax shortfalls by raising the
tax rate for its richest citizens. Now anyone who earns more than
$13,000 will have to pretend to pay 45 percent.

SERBIANS UNITE BEHIND MILO SEVIC  
 (ADV: THIS EDITORIAL APPEARED IN THE APRIL 2 ARIZONA REPUBLIC) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Sweeping from village to village, ruthless Serb forces
continue to drive out and murder ethnic Albanians. In the past
week, 130,000 refugees have fled Kosovo in waves of human misery.
In response, the United States is stepping up its airstrikes on
Serbia _ although nine days of round-the-clock bombing and
cruise-missile attacks have, if anything, united the Yugoslav
people behind President Slobodan Milosevic and triggered even more
Serbian atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   Now, three American soldiers on reconnaissance patrol are
prisoners of the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Bruised and battered, they appear in footage run on CNN every 15
minutes. Anger over their treatment and concern for their safety
are further galvanizing American opposition to Milosevic. But the
trio's capture should suspend, once and for all, the ridiculous
belief that America can wage a war without casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the U.S.-led bombing campaign expands, there is a
growing realization that there are real limitations to waging a
high-tech air war against a well-armed, determined foe. At this
point, Serbian resolve and hundreds of years of nursing grudges are
proving more than a match for what amounts to limited American will
and steel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to say that we have prevented one act of
brutality at this stage,'' Department of Defense spokesman Kenneth
Bacon admitted. ``This is being done very close-up and personal by
the Yugoslav army and special police forces in small groups of
armed, vicious people going out and shooting people at close range,
frequently burning them, shelling their houses.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how carefully calibrated the airstrikes, America's
B-1B bombers, F-15 jets and A-10 Warthog planes can only do so much
from on high. With bombs and precision-guided missiles failing to
force Milosevic to the conference table, talk is turning to whether
ground troops will be sent into action.
</P>
<P>
   Admonitions to pay heed to the ``lessons of Vietnam'' are flying
fast and furious. Among the lessons cited is the futility of
intervening in the civil war of another nation in another region.
Another lesson: The bombing of a people (which translates to the
limited use of military power) rarely produces victory.
</P>
<P>
   Our short-term objectives are clear: Protect the ethnic
Albanians and achieve a credible cease-fire. But our longer-term
objectives are unclear and our ability to achieve even the
short-term ones remains in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The broadening of bombing targets is aimed at further degrading
the Serbian military and forcing it to the bargaining table. The
number of Serb forces in Kosovo must be dramatically reduced,
either through force or an agreement, to allow the refugees to
return. NATO will need to maintain peacekeeping troops in the area.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Britain and France reportedly are discussing commando assaults
into Kosovo to disrupt the killing and also smuggle out top
political figures. This makes sense and U.S. air power would likely
provide support. However, NATO allies are adamant in their
opposition to using ground troops. U.S. officials also have ruled
out the use of ground forces. The American public needs to face
facts: It will be difficult to attain our objectives without the
use _ somebody's use _ of ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   If neither NATO nor the U.S. wants to send ground troops,
neither do they have the political will to wage a long, costly war.
Yet without ground forces, a protracted conflict seems likely. It's
an impossible Catch-22. Milosevic knows this, is counting on it.
Sadly, the world's strongest military alliance looks disturbingly
ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the constant bombing will begin taking a toll and
Serbians deprived of many necessities will eventually clamor for a
cease-fire. Perhaps. But it likely will take something more than
added airstrikes to achieve our objectives in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   We're not sure President Clinton should have gotten the U.S. in
this war. But now that we're in it, it's important to U.S.
credibility and to regional stability that we win it. If the
airstrikes aren't enough, the next step may be deploying ground
troops. That's a reality we hope NATO and U.S. leaders will find a
way to avoid. &QL;

RESEARCHERS FIND NEW SOURCE OF TISSUE-GROWTH CELLS

<P>
   Moving closer to the day when body parts can be regenerated,
scientists say they have succeeded in growing bone, cartilage, and
fat tissue at will, starting with as little as one precursor cell
fished out of an adult volunteer's bone marrow.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said their achievement could ultimately give
doctors a way to repair the damage caused by a variety of
conditions, from arthritis and athletic injury to cardiac failure
and heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Because it uses cells from adults, the technique also sidesteps
a political controversy touched off last November when scientists
first reported that they had cultivated a different sort of
primordial cell thought to exist only in human embryos.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health subsequently said it will fund
research on these embryonic stem cells because of their vast
medical potential. But in February, 70 members of Congress
denounced federal funding as a violation of a law against fetal
research.
</P>
<P>
   The experiments involve a cell of a different sort, a
mesenchymal stem cell, that persists throughout adulthood, making
up about one of every 100,000 cells in the bone marrow.
</P>
<P>
   While embryonic stem cells can give rise to any of the 210 or
more types of cells that make up the human body, mesenchymal stem
cells are the progenitors of only a half-dozen cell types. But that
crucial repertory includes the structural elements of the body:
bone, cartilage, muscle, tendon, fat, and connective tissue called
stroma found in many organs.
</P>
<P>
   Normally the body draws on its reservoir of mesenchymal stem
cells to repair injuries, but ``they're not always available in the
right amount at the right time,'' said Daniel Marshak, a coauthor
of the new report, which appears in this week's issue of Science.
</P>
<P>
   Marshak and his colleagues at Osiris Therapeutics, a small
Baltimore biotech company, have shown that they can induce the
growth of bone, cartilage, and fat cells by putting the mesenchymal
stem cells in different mixtures of growth factors and nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   Muscle cells have proved more difficult to cultivate. ``We
haven't arrived at the right conditions yet, but we're working on
it, and we're pleased with the success we're having,'' said Mark
Pittenger, another Osiris scientist.
</P>
<P>
   The team has a grant from the National Institute of Standards
and Technology to inject stem cell-derived muscle cells into the
hearts of animals with experimentally induced heart attacks to see
if the damage can be repaired.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be complementary to others' efforts to promote new
blood vessel growth in the heart,'' Marshak said. ``Even if you
bring in new vessels, you'd still like to have new cardiac muscle
cells to provide the pumping force the heart needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Gearhart, a Johns Hopkins University researcher who was
one of two scientists to report the growth of embryonic stem cells
last fall, called the new work ``very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we get the go-ahead for federal funding in embryonic
stem cell work, these different approaches will have different
advantages and disadvantages,'' Gearhart said. ``Clearly,
mesenchymal stem cells are a quite viable alternative to embryonic
stem cells for certain tissues.''
</P>
<P>
   Animal experiments have already produced encouraging results in
regenerating bone and cartilage, according to Marshak, who is also
on the faculty of Johns Hopkins University Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   The Osiris team has used mesenchymal stem cells to repair gaps
in the bones of rats and dogs too large to heal spontaneously, and
to regenerate severed Achilles' tendons in rabbits.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to grow human fat cells would seem to be less
useful, but Marshak noted that plastic surgeons might find it
valuable for cosmetic and reconstructive surgery, if researchers
can find a way to ensure that there is only as much fat-cell growth
as desired. Another application might be to test drugs to inhibit
fat-cell growth.
</P>
<P>
   Although it takes special chemical recipes to induce mesenchymal
stem cells to form desired cell types in the test tube, animal
studies have shown that the right tissues develop automatically
when these versatile cells are introduced into the body where they
are needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The body makes what's required,'' Marshak said. ``We're just
helping the body carry out a normal process.''
</P>
<P>
   Regeneration of needed tissues within the body is a different
approach than what other scientists are developing under the
heading of ``tissue engineering,'' the growth of skin cells and
other types outside the body. Both might have advantages in
different situations, Marshak said.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to repair cartilage in damaged joints would be an
important boon to many patients with athletic injuries and
arthritis, a disease that gradually destroys the cartilage lining
of joints. Unlike bone, cartilage does not regenerate
spontaneously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now if you play basketball and injure your knee, the surgeon
will remove the fragments and clean up the wound and give you
physical therapy and you may feel better, but the cartilage doesn't
heal itself,'' Marshak said. ``We're trying to direct the
regeneration of cartilage and bone and the cells in between.''
</P>
<P>
   The group also hopes to inject arthritic joints with mesenchymal
stem cells bearing special genes to halt the underlying
degenerative disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Osiris group has started human trials with breast cancer
patients who have undergone high-dose chemotherapy that has
destroyed their ability to produce blood cells.

GETTING A DYE STAIN FROM A BERBER CARPET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 04, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Shortly after we installed a new Berber carpet in our
basement family room, a downspout overflowed in a heavy rain and
flooded the basement. We pulled up the carpet so it could dry, but
in the process, we stained the carpet with black dye off some
slippers. What's the best way to get this dye out and do you think
the carpet can be relayed or has it shrunk so much in the drying
process?
</P>
<P>
   RICK AND PAM RUBY, Matthews, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   A. Try one of these tricks on the black dye: Rubbing alcohol.
Spray and Wash. Gonzo. A strong solution of baking soda and water.
Ammonia and water. Use these products separately, and do not mix
any with each other. I would not suggest bleach because it could
make the spot lighter than the rug.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think the Berber carpet has shrunk much. After all, the
rug is all wool, I believe, and many rug people suggest that
carpets, especially Orientals, should be washed, not drycleaned,
and one would not recommend this if the rugs shrank. It is worth
putting it back.
</P>
<P>
   If all else fails, a professinal cleaner might help. Or, have
the carpet redyed.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Some large cracks have appeared in my small concrete
back-yard pond. Is there an easy way it can be repaired? It was
painted but I don't know what kind of paint was used. I hate to
think that the whole pond would have to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   DEBBIE JOHNSTON, Mountain Iron, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   A. If the cracks are quite wide, 1/8-inch or wider, I suggest
chipping them out wider and deeper, and installing hydraulic
cement, which will expand as it sets and might give you a good
closure. Sometimes you can put a swimming pool paint on the inside
of the pond, but I am not sure it will penetrate the cracks enough
to seal them, particularly if they are large as you describe. You
could do either of the above chores with the paint still on.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a Gunite pool dealer in your area, they could spray
Gunite, a sprayable concrete used for swimming pools, on the entire
surface of the pond.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you could have a swimming pool company make a vinyl
liner.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We have a park bench that is outside in all kinds of weather.
We want to renew all the natural wood slats and intend to put a
durbale natural finish on the wood. What is the best natural wood
to use on a park bench, and what is the best all-natural
weather-resistant finish we can use? We used a clear poly on last
time, and it just doesn't stand up.
</P>
<P>
   RICHARD JOST, Ocala, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A. Most park benches for yard use are made of mahogany or oak,
both of which are strong and decay-resistant.
</P>
<P>
   You have two choices for a protective covering, and clear poly
is not one of them; varnish will not stand up outdoors, unless you
strip and renew it each year.
</P>
<P>
   One is a clear sealer, which will allow the wood to weather
naturally, and has to be renewed once a year or so. Only once coat
is needed at a time. Or, a semitransparent house stain of the color
of your choice. Only one coat is needed at a time, and one coat
will last three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to keep the wood new looking and unweathered, apply
one coat of CWF (Clear Wood Finish), sold in paint stores. Not ony
will it keep the wood new looking, but it will restore weathered
wood to a new look. It has to be reapplied every few years, or
whenever the wood starts to weather.
</P>
<P>
   But why bother doing this on a regular basis when you can let
the wood weather? Oak and especially mahogany will weather well. My
own bench is mahogany, untreated and left to weather, and it is now
a fine-looking silver color.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, if the bolts and screws are rusting out, replace
them with stainless steel ones. That will be one headache gotten
rid of.
</P>
<P>

   Angela Hess of Lake Wales, Fla. is an intrepid handyperson, and
likes to save a buck.
</P>
<P>
   Wrote Angela, ``This week I reglued a small loose portion of the
refrigerator gasket. it seems to work since newspaper won't pull
through when I close the door. A new gasket is about $185 from
Sears, parts and labor.''
</P>
<P>
   Hess wasn't through, either. ``I used epoxy to devise a small
triangular-shaped piece about one inch at the base to replace a
piece missing in my valuable ceramic lamp which had been damaged in
storage. With airplane paint (better selection of colors), with
gold spray on areas not masked off, the new piece is absolutely
indistinguishable.''
</P>
<P>
   And thank you, Angela Hess. It only takes a little innovation to
fix something. Fromyour descreiption, it sounds like a Tsatsuma
lamp, a Japanese ceramic much in demand and expensive. The handyman
glued his broken one together, and it looks fine, but he does not
choose to look at it too closely.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, the airplane paint used to be called dope in the
days when flying model airplanes were built by boys in the '30s and
'40s.

HOPING FOR A `SOUTH PARK' COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, April 5)   (EDs: SUBS grafs 2-3 to correst EST to EDT; pickup 4thgraf: First,
let's)

<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a tale of two toons, one embarking on a very promising
start, another that may have already peaked after just two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has such high hopes for ``Family Guy'' that it has slotted
it in the coveted 8:30 p.m. EDT slot Sunday after ``The Simpsons''
starting this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Over on Comedy Central, ``South Park,'' which had one of the
greatest rookie seasons on record, tries to rebound from a
disappointing second year, starting with its third-season premiere
at 10 p.m. EDT Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   First, let's go through the cultural references in the second
episode of the ``Family Guy,'' which returns to Fox after more than
a two-month absence following its post-Super Bowl debut:
</P>
<P>
   ``Sesame Street.'' The Wright Brothers. Driver's test. ``Star
Trek.'' William Shatner's overacting. The Road Runner and Wile E.
Coyote. The Amish. ``CHiPs.'' Fox reality shows (``Fast Animals,
Slow Children''). Rosie O'Donnell. Addiction to television.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, no, we are just getting started ... Bigfoot. Sneaking into
R-rated movies. The Vietnam War. Vacuous television anchors. See 'N
Says. AOL chat rooms. ``Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.''
Dennis Franz's butt. James Woods. PBS. ``The Wonder Years.''
``Scooby Doo.'' ``The Wizard of Oz.'' ``Alf.'' ``Gilligan's
Island.'' ``Lost in Space.'' ``I Dream of Jeannie.'' ``Bewitched.''
Lifetime, CBS, UPN and Fox networks. ``Beverly Hills: 90210.''We're
in the homestretch ... Charles Manson. NBC reruns. Old Raisin Bran
commercials. ``Batman.'' Adolf Hitler's invasion of Poland and
takeover of Czechoslovakia. William Shatner's overacting. The
``Star Trek'' landing team guy in the red shirt always getting
killed. William Shatner's overacting. William Shatner's hairpiece.
William Shatner's gut. Klondike Bar commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Feel free to exhale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family Guy,'' from the mind of 25-year-old Seth McFarlane,
chronicles the Griffins of Rhode Island. Dad is a lovable buffoon
in the Ralph Kramden/Fred Flintstone tradition. His wife, Lois, is
the moral center, as is the pet dog, Brian.
</P>
<P>
   High-schooler Meg and younger brother Chris try to get noticed,
while infant Stewie, the genius with the British accent (but
understood only by the show's viewers), is trying to take over the
world and make it safe from broccoli.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, open up for the airplane,'' mom says.``Never! Damn
broccoli,'' Stewie shouts. ``Damn you. And damn the Wright
brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   You will think of ``Airplane,'' watching this show. Don't laugh
too hard; you'll miss three or four lines. Guarantee at least two
or three will be good. Then there is ``South Park,'' the story of
four coarse little kids from Colorado, one of whom dies in every
episode.
</P>
<P>
   The show returns with Kyle, Kenny, Stan and Eric being placed in
an Up With People-style choir, ``Getting Gay with Kids,'' who
travel to Costa Rica to help save the rain forest. They are led by
a hippie music teacher (guest star Jennifer Aniston of
``Friends''), who soon develops a different take on nature.
</P>
<P>
   The episode is good. Not great, not even close, and certainly
not up to the stellar standards set in the first season. And
``South Park'' has been that way for a while.
</P>
<P>
   In sports, there is an expression called ``The Sophomore Jinx.''
It's an axiom that applies to a player who had a great rookie year,
but stumbled in his second. Some players recover from the sophomore
jinx, others don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Park: The Movie'' is slated to come out in June. Before
then, I would like to see ``South Park,'' the series, make a
comeback.

NEW CLERGY TACKLE FIRST EASTER MESSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- For Christian clergy, Easter week can loom like the
Super Bowl, Academy Awards, and presidential inauguration rolled
into one.
</P>
<P>
   For ``rookie'' ministers preparing their first Easter sermon,
the celebration brings with it no small amount of pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from divinity school, new pastors say the challenge is to
say something compelling and novel about a religious holiday that
has been celebrated for centuries. More than anything, new clergy
say they do not want to disappoint their congregants _ who, after
all, voted to hire them _ on such a crucial day.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Renee Wormack-Keels, who became pastor of United
Baptist Church in Boston's Jamaica Plain neighborhood a little more
than three months ago, has been preparing all week.
</P>
<P>
   She has to write two sermons: one for her 6:30 a.m. sunrise
service at Southern Baptist Church in Roxbury, and another for her
service a few hours later at her own church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually haven't felt that much stress,'' says
Wormack-Keels. ``Maybe I don't have the good sense to feel that.''
</P>
<P>
   By late Thursday, after mulling several ideas, Wormack-Keels had
decided to build her sunrise service sermon around the passage in
the Gospel of Matthew that describes the hours Jesus hung on the
cross, because ``Those six hours were the most critical hours for
all of humanity, and we need to reflect on what that means for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   For her main Easter service, Wormack-Keels will turn her focus
to women, using the New Testament story about how women first
discovered Jesus's empty tomb. ``I haven't completely thought it
out, but something along the lines of women carrying the message
that Christ had been resurrected.''
</P>
<P>
   At the First Congregational Church of Rowley, the Rev. Robert
Hagopian, who became pastor Jan. 1, is crafting his first Easter
sermon around the story in the Gospel of John about Mary
Magdalene's encounter with the resurrected Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question I'll have for the congregation is, `When do they
hear Jesus calling their names, and how do they recognize Jesus in
the people in their lives?' '' said Hagopian, 40. Hagopian was
first a banker, than a video producer and marketer, before deciding
to become a minister.
</P>
<P>
   Holy Week, which culminates with the celebration of Jesus's
resurrection on Easter Sunday, is both the most trying and
triumphant season of the ecclesiastical year for any clergy member.
</P>
<P>
   Trying, because of the logistics and rigors of services on
consecutive days starting with Holy Thursday, extending through
Good Friday, and typically culminating Sunday with a sunrise
service and a main Easter celebration.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a triumphant time because Easter is the most
significant and joyous of Christian holidays, the commemoration of
Jesus overcoming death, the event that is the foundation of
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's thrilling and humbling to be the one ultimately
responsible for the whole thing,'' said the Rev. Ann Burgdorf,
pastor of Concordia Lutheran Church in Worcester since November.
</P>
<P>
   She has spent hours over the past week days hashing out Easter
sermon themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little tired, but excited, too,'' said Burgdorf, 59,
who, like Hagopian, decided to become a minister after trying other
jobs.

   ``I'm working through the idea of how on Easter we go from
darkness to light, from Jesus being dead to his being
resurrected,'' Burgdorf said. ``The resurrection means for us a new
relationship with Jesus. And church isn't a place where we come to
remember Jesus, but a place to come into a vibrant relationship
with him because he is working in our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Clergy members just starting out say Easter is a big test
because it represents taking what they spent years learning in
divinity school classrooms, and carrying it to the pulpit before
congregants who come to Easter service eager for a transcendent
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most important week of the year for Christians,''
said Hagopian. ``The pressure is to be able to celebrate what
Easter means, to be able to convey the foundation of our faith in
the most powerful and effective way possible. That is a tall
order.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Manuel Cintron is relishing his first Holy Week and
eagerly awaiting Easter Sunday. Armed with a degree from
Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary in Hamilton, he took over two
months ago as pastor of Christ the King Church in Bridgeport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I don't want to do is fill people's minds
with theology or big, complex terms, because this is about what
Jesus Christ did,'' said Cintron, 32, who is leading a congregation
where he has been worshiping for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Cintron said he will emphasize the hope that Jesus's
resurrection represents for all Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Hope, he added, is an important word in his church, because it
is located in a largely poor neighborhood struggling with drug
abuse, alcoholism, and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people here are living day by day, taking things as they
come, but not looking for or expecting anything better,'' Cintron
said. ``But when we bring Christ into the picture, things can
change and hope becomes real. That hope is made possible through
the resurrection because the same power that caused the
resurrection to happen can also make our resurrection possible. The
story of Jesus didn't end on the cross. The story began on Easter.
We are part of that story.''

`THE SOPRANOS' TAKES AN INTERMISSION, AND IT'S MUCH TOO LONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Subs 4thgraf, On Sunday, to correct EST to EDT.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call ``The Sopranos'' the best new show on television if you
want. You would be right, of course, but still off-base.
</P>
<P>
   No, ``The Sopranos'' is the best show on television, period. And
if you don't like it, I'll send Silvio, Paulie Walnuts and the rest
of Tony's crew over for a little talk.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's not even close, which says more about this
exhilarating drama than it does about the rest of television. ``The
Sopranos'' is a movie a week, better than any movie-of-the-week,
fueled by writing the quality of which is rarely seen in a weekly
series.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, it all wraps up (9 p.m. EDT, HBO), a 13-week run that
began in January. If you think the first 12 left you stunned, be
ready to force your jaw back into joint when it falls to the floor.
The funny thing is, after watching Sunday's episode a fan will be
left with an empty feeling, a hunger, only because they know they
can't get a new fix next week. In fact, you will have to wait until
next January for new installments (the 13-episode season will be
rerun, in order, on Wednesdays at 9 p.m. beginning June 9). It
hurts.
</P>
<P>
   It's that good. Even those who don't subscribe to HBO have
gotten caught up in the show, trading tapes like Grateful
Deadheads. The appeal stems in part from the show's ability to turn
from comedy to violence to a skewed version of the ``The Waltons''
faster than a foot soldier can pull a gun from his ankle holster.
It's short of glorifying the Mafia, but certainly strikes a chord
of empathy that leaves people rooting for the boss, even as he is
snuffing a rival.
</P>
<P>
   For those playing catch-up: ``The Sopranos'' chronicles the life
of Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini), the power behind the North
Jersey mob. Sure, he is not above the stray shooting or strangling
for business purposes, but he has feelings, too. To deal with his
mounting pressures from The Family and his family, not to mention a
complicated childhood, Tony goes off to see a shrink (Lorraine
Bracco). The results are both therapeutic and lethal. Already,
devotees talk of episodes the way ``Sopranos'' characters talk of
the ``Godfather'' installments. Did you see in ``4'' when Anthony
Jr. figured out about what his dad does for a living? Oh yeah, what
about ``9'' and that secret Uncle Junior wants to keep? Sure, but
nothing beats ``5.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahh, ``5,'' officially titled ``College,'' when daughter Meadow
Soprano (Jamie Lynn Sigler) and doting dad Tony Soprano go off to
Maine to tour colleges. Unfortunately, he runs into an old mob
stoolie, so while daughter is meeting with college counselors dad
is introducing the rat to a dirt nap.
</P>
<P>
   It was in this episode that dad is also confronted with his
daughter's knowledge that he is not just in ``waste management.''
It is an uncomfortable moment, and the signature of this series:
The delicate balance between a man who genuinely cares for his
family, friends even ducks but is more than willing to kill.
</P>
<P>
   In short, ``The Sopranos'' works on every level, but here are
some particularly key components to its artistic and commercial
success:
</P>
<P>
   _ It's not (network) TV. It's HBO: The show was shopped to the
networks, which passed. Good thing, since even on Fox ``The
Sopranos'' could not have realized its full potential. While the
violence and nudity (at times, yes, excessive) would never fly on
the nets, it is the profane dialogue that is intrinsic, giving the
show a good deal of its atmosphere and dramatic shading.
</P>
<P>
   _ Location, location, location: You know if, say, ABC was making
this show, it would be shot on some back lot outside of Hollywood.
For HBO, the show is filmed on location in North Jersey. It is fun
to pick out Jersey haunts, like Paterson Falls. And you can't
replicate that Manhattan skyline.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mommie dearest: Nancy Marchand, as matriarch Livia Soprano, is
the character that has fans talking the most. She is either simply
the most overbearing, manipulative, nasty mother-from-hell you ever
came across, or simply pure evil. You make the call.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fat, bald and a sex symbol: One thing is for sure _ Gandolfini
never would have gotten the nod to play the lead if this were on
the networks. But given the role, his menacing presence grandly
offsets his bouts of vulnerability; at times he is a hulking shell
through which you could hear wind whistle. Men want to be him.
Women want to coddle him, or more.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the level of writing gets Shakespearean, as Tony's
business and family interests collide. It's a tragedy in the
making.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God,'' Dr. Melfi says. ``People are going to get
murdered, aren't they?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry about those distractions,'' Tony Soprano says,
dismissing her concerns as Archie Bunker would Edith's. ``Keep your
eye on the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos'' has all year. After Sunday comes the hard part:
Getting through the off-season.

RAPPER NAS IS LIKE . . . LYRICAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the world of rap, it doesn't get any better than Nas. Some
call him a street prophet. He calls himself a thug poet. All that
hype doesn't get close to explaining the mastery of 25-year-old
Nasir Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Purely lyrical, he packs a lot of imagery into a few lines
without resorting to gimmicks. On his third solo album, ``I Am. .
.,'' out Tuesday, Nas proves his critics wrong _ he did not reach
his peak with his last album, the multiplatinum ``It Was Written.''
If anything, ``I Am . . .'' will appeal to underground music fans
and those who listen to so-called urban crossover radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   This album will undoubtedly knock TLC off the top of the
Billboard album chart, a release so widely anticipated that
Columbia Records did not give out advance review copies. A
spokeswoman said the label adopted that approach to prevent
bootleggers from snatching early copies. Instead, the label
released excerpts of several songs, all of them clever, original,
and edgy with rhymes about survival set to hypnotic rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   Like many rappers, Nas speaks for a generation of young men who
know no other opportunity than peddling street drugs. The lyrics
are piercing takes on reality. On ``Hardest Thing To Do Is Stay
Alive,'' he raps: ``When you hear shells coming at you, hot ones
from a shotgun, I bet a (brother) runs faster. Lose a shooter, get
away from a blaster. Think about that casket . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Two singles have been released, ``Hate Me Now'' and ``Nas Is
Like . . .'' Both are masterpieces. ``Hate Me Now'' begins with a
haunting crescendo of voices sampled from choral music, and as
drums join in, Nas raps melodically to a keyboard riff. The album
version is different, said publicist Yvette Davis; it does not
contain the choral music intro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nas Is Like . . .,'' produced by DJ Premier, contains a
keyboard hook so catchy that listeners will like it the first time
around, then will get addicted to the sound. Nas takes advantage of
the music's almost heavenly quality to speak highly of his rapping
skills _ shtick that goes back to rap's earliest days. In between a
chorus of ``Nas is Like . . . my poetry's deep . . . half man, half
amazing,'' Nas drops deep lines like: ``Life is what you make it.
Suicide; few try to take it. Belt tied around their necks, in jail
cells naked. Heaven and hell. Rap legend's presence is felt.''
</P>
<P>
   So he's a little cocky. Nas has shown he has every right to be.

BIJOU PHILLIPS: A JEWEL IN THE ROUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bijou Phillips isn't just another angry rock female. She's the
daughter of John Phillips, the main papa of the popular but
troubled '60s group, the Mamas and Papas. Only 18, she is ready to
explode with ``I'd Rather Eat Glass,'' a dynamic, demon-exorcising
album in which she sounds like a mix of Natalie Imbruglia, Tori
Amos, and Chrissie Hynde by way of ``The Twilight Zone.''
</P>
<P>
   An awkward tenderness is mixed with naked aggression, as
Phillips works out the deep-seated vulnerability that comes from
having a space-hippie father who often wasn't around because of his
famed drug and alcohol sprees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd go to the studio and play guitar and freak out and start
crying,'' Bijou says of the shakier moments in recording her debut
disc, produced by Jerry Harrison of Talking Heads fame.``Someone
from my label would come and I'd say, `I suck, why did you sign
me?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, whose album was just pushed back to a mid-April
release, has led a highly unusual life, starting with being born
four weeks premature and delivered on a couch by her father. ``The
ambulance came an hour late and I went into shock,'' says Bijou.
``My mother (Genevieve Wait) said I was born on cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have so much anger about parts of my life. I have enough
anger for the world, but I'm in therapy,'' she adds in a recent
phone interview from her Los Angeles home.
</P>
<P>
   The anger bubbles up in the music. ``To have seen what I've seen
_ so tired, baby,'' she wails in the song ``So Tired.'' In the
autobiographical ``Little Dipper'' she sings about a ``sweet little
mind corrupted over time'' and ``I could watch you all night
drinking booze till the break of dawn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I brought myself up,'' says Phillips, who is the half sister
of actress-singer MacKenzie and singer Chynna Phillips. ``My dad
was there at times for me, but at times he wasn't because he was
using alcohol and drugs. Or he'd be in the hospital or, when he'd
be in the house, he'd be sick. Or he'd be on tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd decide to go to school or not. Most of the time, I
didn't,'' says Phillips, a high school dropout. ``Other times I'd
go swimming or eat Jell-O or play with my animals. I had horses and
a pig and lots of dogs. The animals were my salvation. And I had a
lot of microwave meals and watched a lot of the Disney Channel.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips has endured crazy times _ including a chaotic teenage
stay in Manhattan when she did some modeling and led a wild life
sneaking into clubs at night. But though she sings on the album
that ``I could be an alcoholic,'' she reports that ``I can't drink
much because I have kidney trouble. It's kind of good, because I
could have been an alcoholic. I can drink a little, but I never
really liked alcohol because I associate it with 1) my mom being
psychotic; 2) my dad having a liver transplant; and 3) I could die
from it.''
</P>
<P>
   She was a late-bloomer who didn't learn to play guitar until age
15 (her dad taught her) but who has been a quick study ever since.
As for musical influences, ``I listened to Rickie Lee Jones, the
Jackson 5, and Van Morrison _ he was cool. And I liked Joni
Mitchell and a lot of Hendrix and my dad's music and the Beatles.
And a lot of Patsy Cline, Billie Holiday, and Ella Fitzgerald.''
</P>
<P>
   That's an eclectic bunch, though this first record (she co-wrote
most of it) is mainly filled with urgent alt-pop, looped
percussion, and driving guitars and vocal harmonies (some from her
half-sister, MacKenzie). As for a tour, Bijou says, ``Maybe in a
month or two, but I really want to get out there.''
</P>
<P>

   More on Geils: ``I think we'll fit in just fine,'' J. Geils
keyboardist Seth Justman says of how the Geils reunion will jibe
with this summer's concert picture. ``There's always a place for
hard-rocking, funky rock 'n' roll. . . . It all goes back to James
Brown, Little Richard, Elvis, and Sly &AMP; the Family Stone. As long
as you're playing hard with sincerity, people will listen.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is going to question the Geils Band's sense of history.
According to singer Peter Wolf, the group's opening acts have
included U2, Billy Joel, and Fleetwood Mac.
</P>
<P>
   The Geils reunion is at the Tweeter Center in Mansfield, Mass.
June 23 and 24.

<P>
   Aerosmith's management shuffle: It was only three years ago that
Aerosmith had a falling out with Boston-based manager Tim Collins _
and now comes the firing of Collins's successor, New York-based
Wendy Laister. She has not commented this week, but a woman at her
office says Laister was ``taken completely by surprise.'' The
band's PR person, Luke Burland of the KSA Agency, then resigned,
partly because she's a friend of Laister and found it
``unbelievable'' that Laister could be fired.
</P>
<P>
   An aide with the band says the group wanted a manager who
``could take them to the next level,'' but after a year in which
Aerosmith performed at the Grammys and the Oscars, had its first
No. 1 single, and sold every ticket in sight, what is the next
level?
</P>
<P>
   ``The next level is down,'' says one industry observer.
</P>
<P>
   A source confirms that Aerosmith is signing with HK Mgt. in Los
Angeles, a goliath that also manages Jimmy Buffett, Mick Jagger,
Steely Dan, Lenny Kravitz, Boston, Stevie Nicks, Fiona Apple, Dan
Fogelberg, and Chicago. HK, named for Howard Kaufman, is big and
well-respected, but Aerosmith is used to a manager who only works
for them (neither Collins nor Laister had other clients). On the
bright side for fans: Look for Aerosmith to play an area date this
summer.

WE DESERVE BETTER FROM `THE-OUT-OF-TOWNERS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By G. ALLEN JOHNSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consider ``The Out-of-Towners'' to be confirmation that Steve
Martin and Goldie Hawn never again will be anything more than easy,
safe amusement. One-time progenitors of the comedic edge, they seem
more willing to evoke the slapstick of the 1930s screwball comedies
than the kind of irreverence that produced ``The Man with Two
Brains'' and ``Private Benjamin.''
</P>
<P>
   So this is what happens to an aging jerk and a ``Laugh-In''
girl.
</P>
<P>
   They make middling retreads of mediocre films. Heck, they don't
even achieve the pleasing, if vanilla results of ``Housesitter,''
their 1992 pairing in which Hawn especially excelled at creating
suspense and poignancy in her comic portrayal of a chronic but
needy liar to Martin's befuddled lonely architect.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the 1970 film written by Neil Simon and starring Jack
Lemmon and Sandy Dennis, ``The Out-of-Towners'' is about an Ohio
couple, Henry and Nancy Clark, who have just sent their son (Oliver
Hudson, Hawn's real-life son) off to Europe for a year abroad. They
head to New York for Henry's job interview at a high-profile
advertising firm. They have a daughter living in Manhattan, and
unbeknownst to Nancy, Henry has recently been fired from his job.
</P>
<P>
   (When she finds out, he gamely insists, like a true ad man, ``It
wasn't a lie. It was spin.'')
</P>
<P>
   Without children or work to define them, the couple must
discover each other all over again through a series of madcap
adventures. For starters, their flight is rerouted to Boston, then
after being mugged they find out their daughter has maxed out the
one credit card left to them.
</P>
<P>
   That means they can't check into their luxury hotel, and are
thrown out by the manager (John Cleese, in a hilarious ``Fawlty
Towers''-like supporting performance). They must prowl the streets
of Manhattan, looking for food and a good night's sleep. They
stumble upon a support group for sexually dysfunctional people,
make love in Central Park and tangle with armed robbers.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is the requisite arrest and jail scene that,
like a combination jump at an ice skating competition, is a
required element in the normal-people-in-wacky-circumstances movie.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, questions might arise. Such as:
</P>
<P>
   What is New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani doing in yet another
film?
</P>
<P>
   To whom does the soundtrack, a gentle mix of Vaudevillian/Disney
music and easy listening hits, appeal?
</P>
<P>
   Does anyone really laugh at the abrasive New York cabdriver or
the Korean-shopowner-who-can't-speak-English stereotypes anymore?
</P>
<P>
   Why do we only see the daughter in a fleeting, wordless shot at
the end, even though she is constantly referred to, is integral to
the plot and lives in Manhattan? A scene with her would have also
helped resolve a major emotional subplot, which is left dangling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Out-of-Towners'' is competent, to be sure, with some good
lines. Director Sam Weisman keeps a fast pace. It's as slickly
produced (by Robert Evans) a Hollywood romantic comedy as
``Armageddon'' was an action flick _ all the money they want and
need, big-name cast and everything plays in Peoria.
</P>
<P>
   But so what? This kind of formulaic movie seems beneath the
talents of Martin, who has no use for the arrow through the head
anymore (unfortunately), and Hawn, who had her finger on the pulse
of women's issues in social comedies like ``Benjamin,'' ``Swing
Shift'' and ``First Wives Club.''
</P>
<P>
   There should have been a lesson to them in Marc Lawrence's
screenplay adaptation, in which parents with high expectations of
their children suddenly must step back and apply those expectations
to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They owe us one.

IMPATIENT INVESTORS NOT WAITING ANYMORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   People forget now, but legendary money manager John Neff had two
rotten years in a row when he ran Vanguard's Windsor Fund. In 1989,
he underperformed the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index by 16 percentage
points; in 1990, he fell short of the index by 12 points. Yet
investors continued to put money into the fund on the belief _
later justified _ that Neff eventually would snap out of his slump.
</P>
<P>
   Neff's successor, Charles Freeman, wasn't as lucky. He turned in
some rotten numbers in 1997 and 1998, and investors reacted by
yanking billions of dollars from his fund. Last week, in a bid to
stop the bleeding, Vanguard named two new managers to help Freeman
run Windsor.
</P>
<P>
   The point of the story: Investors are not as patient as they
once were.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund buyers are pulling the trigger quicker than ever,
say industry executives. They are bailing out of funds that are not
keeping pace with the market averages and piling into funds that
are. ``People are chasing performance,'' says Thomas O'Neill, chief
investment officer at Fleet Financial Group.
</P>
<P>
   Such behavior flies in the face of all the accepted wisdom about
investing. You know the drill. Investing is a marathon, not a
sprint. The wise investor diversifies his holdings _ big stocks,
little stocks, growth stocks, value stocks _ and then waits for
good things to happen.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is no one is waiting anymore. Consider a few
numbers. In the first two months of 1999, mutual fund investors
poured more than $16 billion into large-cap growth funds, according
to Boston-based Financial Research Corp. They put another $3
billion into science and technology funds.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because those funds did fabulously in 1998, thanks to the
super-charged returns of the Internet stocks and technology giants
like Microsoft and America Online.
</P>
<P>
   In the same two-month period, investors pulled money out of
value funds, small cap funds, international funds, and real estate
funds, all of which had mediocre to poor returns in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The impatient investor's motto seems to be: What have you done
for me lately?
</P>
<P>
   A number of different forces explain the new behavior. For one
thing, the gap between the stock market's winners and losers is
unusually large. Big stocks, as measured by the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500, returned nearly 30 percent last year; small stocks, as
represented by the Russell 2000, lost 2.2 percent for the year.
With that kind of spread, it's no wonder those on the losing team
want to switch sides.
</P>
<P>
   The media, including people like us, heighten the awareness of
the gaps by telling investors about performance on a daily basis.
And with the rise of mutual fund supermarkets run by Fidelity
Investments and Charles Schwab, investors can switch funds and even
fund families with a phone call or a click of the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Burt Greenwald identifies one more culprit: fee-based financial
planners. Says Greenwald, a mutual-fund consultant from
Philadelphia, ``It's hard for these guys to justify that fee if
there is nothing positive happening in your account. They have a
strong motivation to make changes, sometimes just for the sake of
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Could this new quick-on-the-draw style of investing be a good
thing? The people at T. Rowe Price certainly don't think so. In a
special mailing sent to investors this week, the Baltimore mutual
fund company urges its customers to keep the faith in the old way
of doing business. ``Prudent investors believe in keeping their
assets sensibly diversified and avoiding knee-jerk decisions at
points of maximum pain,'' writes David Warren, an international
investing specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Adds his colleague, Preston Athey, a small-cap manager, ``Many
people are enamored of large-cap stocks and the Internet. But to
believe that they are the only places to put your money, and that
they will be the best places to have your money over the next 10
years, flies in the face of a century of experience of how stocks
behave.''
</P>
<P>
   Their advice? Stay diversified. Put some money into small-cap,
international, and value funds, even though those funds are doing
poorly today. Eventually the tide will turn and you will be happy
you had your eggs in more than one basket.
</P>
<P>
   The T. Rowe Price essay has an old-fashioned, almost fuddy-duddy
quality to it. It reminds you of a father handing the car keys to
his teenage son and urging him to drive safely and avoid speeding.
You just know the minute the kid is out of sight he is going to
step on the accelerator and zoom away at 75 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, too, are unlikely to heed the sensible advice _ at
least until their risky behavior sends them crashing into a wall.

GAY PARTY POLARIZES SAN FRANCISCO WORSHIPERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELIZABETH FERNANDEZ  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Easter disagreement between the Roman
Catholic Church and an often profane street theater group that
targets the church with biting satire is dividing clergy of other
denominations.
</P>
<P>
   To some ministers, the etiquette of secular society is clear: It
is wrong to deliberately offend any religion on a spiritually
meaningful day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than have a culture war, which is what this is, I would
have preferred that people accommodate the church's concerns,''
said the Rev. Alan Jones, a Methodist minister.
</P>
<P>
   But to other members of San Francisco's clergy, free speech _
even ridicule _ must prevail. And so should a sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have thought the Catholic Church would be big enough
to understand,'' said the Rev. Margot Campbell Gross of the
Unitarian Universalist Church. ``This protest is not worthy of
them; I think they make themselves less by protesting in this way.
It's important for different faiths not to take themselves too
seriously. Humor can be a way of generating tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   In the heartfelt quarrel that has roused all manner of secular
and theological debate, the San Francisco Archdiocese contends that
city officials should not have granted a street closing permit to
the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence for a public party on the
holiest of church days, Easter.
</P>
<P>
   The Sisters, however, who have strong ties to the gay community,
have partied on Easter for two decades and refused to budge from
their 20th anniversary bash on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Supervisors declined to rescind the permit the
street party.
</P>
<P>
   The stalemate between two of the most influential blocs in San
Francisco _ the Catholic Church and the gay community _ has
generated national headlines and triggered a call for an economic
boycott by a conservative Catholic organization based in New York.
As Holy Week draws to a close, emotional debate continues among
various denominations even as clergy bustle with Easter
preparations.
</P>
<P>
   To some religious leaders, it's a simple matter of dignity and
respect for individual faith traditions. While acknowledging the
Sisters' charitable contributions, some clergy maintain that an
Easter fete by a group that mocks Catholicism is an affront not
only to Roman Catholics but all Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about their holding this on Easter,'' said the
Rev. Canon Frances Tornquist, a board member of the San Francisco
Interfaith Council and the vice dean of Grace Cathedral, the city's
largest Episcopal church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a bit torn. My association with the Sisters generally has
been good. I try to look at it from both sides ... But I think it's
not a good thing to have this on Easter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Interfaith Council agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Representing about a dozen major faiths, including Christians,
Muslims and Jews, the council had urged the city supervisors to
honor ``the sanctity of Easter Sunday and help this group find
another day on which to have their celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   Rita Semel, executive vice chair of the Interfaith Council, said
the organization respects the rights of free speech and assembly,
but wishes the Sisters had gracefully chosen a different day to
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is hardly a downtrodden minority anymore,'' said Semel, a
member of Temple Emanu-El. ``If you look at the political scene in
San Francisco ... the gay and lesbian community has plenty of
clout. One of the evidences of maturity is that you don't have to
win every battle.''
</P>
<P>
   In a city that epitomizes political correctness, some clergy
find galling the ribald presence of the Sisters, who with impunity
mock the Catholic faith _ among other activities, Sunday's party
features a ``hunky Jesus'' contest. For them, such disrespect
diminishes the considerable charitable contributions to gay causes
that the Sisters have made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody should be ridiculing other people's faith,'' said
Iftekhar Hai, director of Interfaith Relations of United Muslims of
America.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indicative of the polarizing nature of the issue, however, other
clergy members said they were ``embarrassed'' by the stance of the
archdiocese, which triggered the debate on the pages of its
newspaper, Catholic San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm rather disappointed by the position the archdiocese has
taken,'' said the Rev. David Norgard, an Episcopal priest and
rector of St. John the Evangelist church in the Mission District.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem to present themselves as having a monopoly, a corner
on Easter. They don't own it. The fact is we celebrate Easter, too,
and the Sisters are in no way hindering us ... or Catholics who
want to celebrate Easter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sisters are a valued part of San Francisco, a city of
great diversity, great pluralism in religion. Easter is a day to
celebrate and they are celebrating in their own way. I bet you it
will be their largest (turnout), their best party ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Other clergy who support the Sisters note the troupe's members
feel hostility toward Catholicism because the church teaches that
homosexuality is an ``objective disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, this really is about homophobia, not about
protecting Catholic rights,'' said the Rev. Mark Stanger, associate
pastor at Grace Cathedral. ``We Christians cannot expect the
secular order to bow down to us, to keep our sacred days. I'm
scandalized that other Christians would want the civil order to
enforce our beliefs. This kind of behavior is unworthy of
Christians and I'm embarrassed by it.''

THE HOMER'S ODYSSEY BEGAN WITH AN EPIC FIGURE: RUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today we pay homage to the home run.
</P>
<P>
   Like free food, spring flowers, and funny jokes, homers are
good. Everyone loves home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Homers brought baseball back to prime time in 1998, saving the
national pastime from the fury and fallout of the 1994 World
Series-killing strike. Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa's version of ``I
Know What You Did Last Summer'' inspired a new generation of
hardball fans and fortified long-suffering seamheads who'd been
waiting for a sign that the game wasn't dead.
</P>
<P>
   In this spirit of diamond revival, it's important that we
remember the man who invented the home run, George Herman Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   OK, there were long balls and home run hitters before the Babe,
just as there were slam-dunk artists before Julius Erving and rock
singers before Elvis. But Ruth made himself synonymous with the
circuit clout. More than 60 years after he last played, long home
runs are still described as Ruthian shots.
</P>
<P>
   Home runs were not an integral part of baseball in the days
before the Babe. Outfield fences were designed to keep
gate-crashers out. There wasn't much expectation that balls would
be hit over the walls. Fans were just as likely to see an
inside-the-park homer.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth changed everything. He colorized the gray game and made it
America's favorite form of spectator recreation. He walked into a
game of pitching, speed, and defense, and took it over with his
oversized appetites and tape-measure homers. And just as McGwire
and Sosa brought baseball back from labor strife, Ruth's exploits
saved the game from the dark hours of the game's greatest scandal _
the fixing of the 1919 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   So many years later, it is almost impossible to comprehend
Ruth's impact on the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics help. It's dazzling to retrace the Babe's emergence
as baseball's ultimate home run king. Hank Aaron, Roger Maris, and
McGwire all eventually topped the Bambino's records, but their
margins were puny compared with the dominance Ruth held over the
sport at the peak of his powers. Think of Michael Jordan walking
into a Dr. Naismith peach-basket game in Springfield 100 years ago
and you have a perspective on Ruth's impact on baseball in the
1920s.
</P>
<P>
   As a pitcher/outfielder in his final season with the Red Sox in
1919, Ruth hit 29 home runs, shattering the American League record
of 16 (set by Ralph ``Socks'' Seybold in 1902), and the ``modern''
major league record of 24 (Gavvy Cravath, 1915 Phillies).
</P>
<P>
   A year later, he hit an astonishing 54 homers in his first year
with the Yankees (the big league runner-up hit 19). It was the
greatest single season of hitting in big league history. Try this:
Ruth had a .376 average with 54 homers, 137 RBIs, 158 runs, 14
stolen bases, 36 doubles, 9 triples and a (still) record slugging
percentage of .847. His homer total was 10 more than any other
American League team.
</P>
<P>
   In Ruth's second season with the Yankees, he hit his 139th
homer, passing Roger Connor to become the major league career home
run leader. The Bambino would hold this title until 1974 when Aaron
crashed homer No. 715.
</P>
<P>
   The Babe owned the home run. At the end of the 1928 season,
there had been 10 big league seasons of 40 or more homers and Ruth
had seven of them. He led the American League in homers 12 times
between 1918 and 1932. When he hit his 700th home run in 1934,
there were only two other players who'd hit as many as 300. He
retired with more than twice as many homers as any player and Aaron
didn't catch him for nearly 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, with the Babe, it was never solely about statistics.
He was the largest figure in the country, bigger than any
politician or entertainer. Who else could stroll over to President
Harding during a game against the Senators and say, ``Hot as hell,
ain't it Prez?''
</P>
<P>
   He promised a boy in a hospital that he would hit a homer. Then
he delivered. He pointed to center field in the middle of an at-bat
in the World Series. Then he delivered. He hit the longest home
runs in every park. He delighted the kids wherever he went.
</P>
<P>
   His name became a synonym for ``best'' or ``biggest.'' Time
magazine reported that Willie Sutton was ``the Babe Ruth of bank
robbers.'' Japanese soldiers cursed the name ``Babe Ruth'' when
confronting American dogfaces on Guadalcanal in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   This is Jimmy Cannon in the New York Post on Ruth: ``The myth
celebrates American innocence in a good lost time, and Babe Ruth
was more than a man. He was a parade all by himself, a burst of
dazzle and jingle, Santa Claus drinking his whiskey straight and
groaning with a bellyache caused by gluttony.''
</P>
<P>
   Decades later, hundreds of thousands of kids play Babe Ruth
League Baseball. Muhammad Ali became the Babe Ruth of the '60s and
'70s, and Jordan was the Ruth of the '90s. At the end of this year,
ESPN will finish its countdown of the top 100 American athletes of
the century, and Ruth had better be No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, late House Speaker Tip O'Neill recalled a Cambridge
event from his youth attended by the Babe.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never got into the hall,'' said the Speaker. ``The crowd
was so huge. That was an era in which there were idols, but nobody,
nobody in the history of this country was the idol that Babe Ruth
was.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bambino. Still the one.

BLEAKER SIDE OF THE BOOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A &UR;  &LR; bull market in a china closet. You could not tell that by
reading only the first words of the stories about the Dow closing
above 10,000 for the first time on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal said 10,000 symbolized ``the astonishing
success and giddy exuberance of the US economy this decade.'' The
New York Times said, ``The Dow achieved a perfect 10 Thursday.
Thousand, that is,'' reflecting ``the unparalleled strength of the
economy and the dominance of the world economic stage by American
corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post said the Dow underscored ``the optimism of
new investors dazzled by the high-tech boom and the nation's robust
economy.'' The Boston Globe said it highlighted ``a remarkable
period of economic growth in the nation.'' The Los Angeles Times
said it was a ``major milestone in a 17-year bull market fueled by
_ and now perhaps fueling _ the best US economy in a generation.''
</P>
<P>
   You have to go deeper into the stories to see that someone's
fuel is someone else's fumes, or that some dishes are falling. The
Post cited a ``performance gap,'' in which the 30 blue-chip stocks
of giant corporations in the Dow Jones Industrial Average had risen
in the past year by 8.99 percent, while the Russell 2000 index of
small stocks had fallen 5.26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The underpinnings of the market are slowly getting whittled
away,'' said Mark Arbeter, chief technical analyst at Standard &AMP;
Poor's. Thomas O'Neill, chief investment officer of Fleet Financial
Group, said that unless the market shows a more uniform growth,
``it won't be a healthy long-term condition.''
</P>
<P>
   The same can be said about the human condition. This week,
United for a Fair Economy, a Boston-based organization that tracks
income and wealth trends in the United States, released a report
that shows that the boom has enriched only the top 5 percent of
households in America. An astounding 95 percent of households have
seen a decline in net worth.
</P>
<P>
   The report, ``Shifting Fortunes: The Perils of the Growing
American Wealth Gap,'' found that between 1983 and 1995, the
richest 1 percent of households saw a rise in net worth of 17.4
percent, adjusted for inflation. The top 2 to 5 percent of
households saw a rise in net worth of half a percent.
</P>
<P>
   The households that would rank in the top 91th to 95th
percentiles of wealth saw a drop of 2.3 percent in net worth. The
households that would rank in the top 81st to 90th percentiles saw
a drop of 5.3 percent. The households that would place in the 61st
to 80th percentiles fell by 6.5 pcercent.
</P>
<P>
   Then the dishes really break into pieces. The households that
would rank in the 41st through 60th percentiles fell 11.5 percent
in net worth. The bottom 40 percent of American households saw a
collapse of 79.6 percent in net worth.
</P>
<P>
   The richest 1 percent of US households now hoard 40.1 percent of
America's wealth. That is double the 19.9 percent of wealth the top
1 percent held in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons are many. Weekly wages for the average American are
12 percent below their inflation-adjusted levels of 1973.
Middle-income families are putting in the equivalent of eight weeks
more time on the job than in 1979. But over the last decade the
real pay for extra hours works out to $2.20 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Without a strong return on their labor, Americans are saving
less to keep up with costs that have risen way beyond inflation for
housing and college. Americans saved only 0.5 percent of their
income last year, compared to 8.6 percent in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are falling deeper into debt to purchase cars and
other big-ticket items. Debt as a percentage of personal income has
risen from 29.9 percent in 1949 to an estimated 84.8 percent in
1997. Credit-card debt in the US has more than doubled in the last
decade, from $243 billion to $560 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The poor bear the heaviest burden of credit cards. In 1995, 27
percent of families with incomes under $10,000 had bills that rose
above 40 percent of their incomes. Less than 5 percent of families
making more than $50,000 had such a burden.
</P>
<P>
   The wealth gap is so huge that Lester Thurow, professor at the
MIT Sloan School of Management and who wrote a foreword for the
report, said, ``the great American middle class has become a
nonparticipant in the American dream.'' It is so huge that the
report concludes that serious measures have to be taken to address
it, such as wealth taxation, capping corparate tax deductions and
stronger taxes for estates and capital gains.
</P>
<P>
   It is so huge that this bull needs a tranquilizer to save the
china closet. Ralph Acampora, chief strategist at Prudential
Securities, bragged that 10,000 is ``no longer a ceiling. It's a
floor. As time goes by, we'll be looking down at it.''
</P>
<P>
   And looking down at the debt-ridden masses who are searching on
the floor to pick up the pieces of their broken plates. If
investors could put aside their giddy exuberance for a moment, it
might be worth considering that the last time the top 1 percent of
Americans had this much wealth was in 1929, just before the crash
of Wall Street and the Great Depression.

CHURCH TAKES TO BULLY PULPIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A friend writes: ``USA Weekend, a newspaper supplement magazine
distributed primarily on Sunday, has just announced a poll that
asks its readers to call and vote on whether or not parents
refusing medical treatment in favor of prayer for their children
should be subject to criminal prosecution. The Christian Science
Church's Committee on Publication, based at the Boston headquarters
(with assistants in each church around the world), notified all its
assistants with the directive to phone all members of all their
churches in the United States to call and vote `no' on the poll.
Members were not given a copy of the questionnaire in the paper;
they were just told to call and vote no.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is interesting, since the church prides itself on taking
no political stands or preaching from the pulpit. They should also
know better than to try to affect a poll in a national magazine.
One can only wonder how they would react if something equally
untoward was to happen to them in their paper,'' referring, of
course, to the Christian Science Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Some context: The USA Weekend poll is being conducted to
accompany a long feature story on faith healing, according to
religion editor Kathy McCleary. The precise poll question is
``Should it be a crime for parents to withold medical treatment
from children for religious reasons?'' The magazine is running the
story and poll _ to be published April 25 _ partly in response to
some high-profile cases of infant death in Oregon, which is now
considering a bill to criminalize faith healing of small children.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Science church, which advocates spiritual healing
over medical treatment, has had to litigate similar cases over the
years, most notably the Massachusetts prosecution of Ginger and
David Twitchell, whose infant son died of a medically preventable
bowel obstruction in 1986. The cases in Oregon have nothing to do
with Christian Science; nonetheless the church opposes state laws
that ban faith healing.
</P>
<P>
   Per the USA Weekend poll, I am in receipt of this fax from Gary
Jones, manager of the Committee on Publication: ``Pardon our zeal,
Alex! Of course we spread the word. But people still dial the phone
and follow their own conscience.''

<P>

<P>
   Case in point
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   How very unsurprising that the San Francisco-based Landmark
Education Corp., widely known as the Forum, is still using the
embarrassingly stupid and one-sided Harvard Business School case
study, ``Landmark Education Corporation: Selling a Paradigm
Shift,'' to hawk its wares. Landmark is a Werner Erhard/est spinoff
(``a heady combination of pseudoscience, religion, and money,''
according to Radcliffe public policy fellow Wendy Kaminer) that has
found quite an audience with the self-actualization crowd. Landmark
also has clients in corporate America. Even after protests from the
business school about nonacademic use of the case, Landmark still
teases the study off the front page of its Web site,
http://www.landmark-education.com.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year, however, Harvard has restricted sale of the
case ``to faculty and staff of universities.'' Harvard and Landmark
also say that the case does ``not in any way constitute an
endorsement or statement of official position, positive or
negative, regarding their subject matter'' _ a ludicrous disclaimer
of a study that uncritically quotes Forum executives comparing
themselves to Socrates and Galileo.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard case has also surfaced in a debate in Grand Rapids,
Mich., over whether to hire the Gilmore Group, a consulting firm
led by former Landmark manager Elizabeth Gilmore, to help the city
conduct a ``cultural transformation'' of its municipal employees.
(Gilmore worked for Landmark on a similar contract in Highland
Park, Mich.) A city employee who sits on a committee reviewing the
proposed contract says the study was distributed ``to give some
background information as to what Landmark Education was all about
and to show that it was not a cult.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore says she doesn't know why the case study was handed out
in Grand Rapids, and points out that she hasn't been affiliated
with Landmark for the past three years: ``Landmark technology is
copyrighted and I'm not using it in any way.''

STRONG ACTING CARRIES `WALK ON THE MOON' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
A WALK ON THE MOON 
Directed by: Tony Goldwyn 
Screenplay by: Pamela Gray 
Starring: Diane Lane, Viggo Mortensen, Liev Schreiber, Anna Paquin,
Tovuh Feldshuh, Bobby Boriello, Joseph Perrino 
Running time: 106 minutes 
Rated: R (sexuality, language and some drug use) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember the summer of 1969? Screenwriter Pamela Gray does, and
so does Tony Goldwyn, making a convincing, handsomely crafted
directorial debut in ``A Walk on the Moon.'' It was, of course, not
only the summer of the moon walk but of Woodstock and flower power
and, in this film, the converging of those events to generate a
moonshine-filled, Catskills- bungalow-colony Madame Bovary. As the
film opens, Diane Lane's Brooklyn Jewish housewife and mother,
Pearl, who married young, is growing just old enough to be haunted
by the feeling that life is passing her by. There's a lively bustle
as she and her family jam their car full of stuff and set out for
the annual summer getaway. But director Goldwyn frankly tips his
hand when he has Lane look searchingly over her shoulder at a pair
of hippies they pass on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after she, her two kids and her mother-in-law are
ensconced in their modest summer quarters (Pearl's TV repairman
hubby, played by Liev Schreiber, commutes weekends). The little
frowns of discontent soften when an itinerant peddler known as
``the blouse man'' pulls up with his busload of merchandise and
begins shmoozing the women about how the colors in this or that
blouse match the colors in their eyes. It doesn't take Pearl long
to move from a new tie-dyed purple pullover to the Catskills
version of Trouble Right Here in River City _ skinny-dipping under
a waterfall with Viggo Mortensen's restless blouse vendor. It isn't
long before the whole nosy place knows what's going on and before
Pearl's mother-in-law begins nodding balefully.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the picture is the fact that Pearl's teenage
daughter (Anna Paquin) is discovering boys, dating, and sex, and
Pearl has lost the moral high ground when it comes to laying down
the law. But then one of the likable things about Goldwyn's
direction is that he lets the actors play against the action and
resist cliche. Thus, Lane's dissatisfied Pearl, in addition to
creating an impression of being unassumingly sexy, convinces us
she's a woman trying to retroactively sow a few wild oats, spurred
on by the example of the unfettered hippies en route to Woodstock.
Mortensen's blouse man, despite an anti-Vietnam bitterness (his
brother is missing in action there), projects a persuasive softness
that lifts him out of serpent-in-Eden stereotyping. Even Feldshuh's
mother-in-law skirts disapproving gorgon cliches to embody an
understanding family-oriented woman who avoids snap judgments and
only wants things to turn out OK.
</P>
<P>
   In short, there's enough nicely detailed acting _ this includes
Paquin's assertive and vulnerable emerging daughter, one of the few
believably faceted teens in recent Hollywood movies, and
Schreiber's deceived husband, convincing in his pain _ to carry the
film beyond what could have been a black hole of stiltedness. The
film is a little easy on consequences for everybody, but then it
just as believably empathizes with its characters. There also are
times when it seems more a manufactured object than a spontaneous
eruption of conflicting emotions. But the acting _ and the acting
out _ carry it. Clearly, Goldwyn has a future in directing if he
wants one. In the meantime, ``A Walk on the Moon'' is emotionally
complex enough to provide a satisfying helping of time travel that
gives us more to savor than the usual screenful of vintage cars.

TARZAN FOREVER 
The Life of Edgar Rice Burroughs, Creator of Tarzan 
By John Taliaferro 
Scribner, 400 pp., illustrated, $30 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Well past middle age, well past even Tarzan's prime, Edgar Rice
Burroughs was eating dinner in a Honolulu restaurant when he
spotted Ernest Hemingway and his wife, journalist Martha Gellhorn,
at another table. It was 1941 and Hemingway had just finished ``For
Whom the Bell Tolls.'' Burroughs was churning out pulp
``novelettes'' set on Mars and Venus. Burroughs's wife prodded him
to approach Hemingway, but he refused. She suggested the two
writers should get together sometime to compare notes. Burroughs
stayed rooted in his seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``As near as he had been to Hemingway,'' journalist John
Taliaferro writes in ``Tarzan Forever,'' ``he understood that they
were in fact oceans apart. . . . Reviewers would praise (`For Whom
the Bell Tolls') for its skill at balancing `delicacy' and
`brutality,' qualities Burroughs instilled in all of his heroes,
though none of his novels had ever received the serious attention
paid to Hemingway's. If Florence didn't realize the critical gulf
separating the two authors, Burroughs surely did, and his glowering
silence was as good as an admission.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Tarzan Forever,'' Taliaferro examines this respectability
gap as it runs through Burroughs's voluminous writings and diaries.
On one side, he finds a complex and insecure pulp adventure writer
stunned at his own success; on the other, he finds millions of
readers and moviegoers willing to embrace an Edenic ape man as an
American cultural archetype. Taliaferro is on a mission to
rehabilitate Burroughs from his ``undeserved ostracism.'' Indeed,
the book is a good-natured hagiography of a hack.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his life, Burroughs wrote for pulp magazines (named
for their coarse paper) and was paid by the word. Although he
pretended not to mind his lowbrow status, he struggled all his life
to break into ``slicks'' like Collier's and the Saturday Evening
Post. ``I don't think my work is `literature,' I'm not fooling
myself about that,'' he told the Los Angeles Times. He placed
himself in the same class as ``the aerial artist, the tap dancer,
and the clown.''
</P>
<P>
   But Burroughs is nevertheless the rightful owner of a place in
20th-century American letters. His grip on the public imagination
is hard to deny _ by conservative estimates, he sold 30 million
books during his lifetime. He became one of the first writers to
incorporate, and in 1931, weary of middlemen, began publishing his
books under the ERB, Inc. imprint. He licensed Tarzan statuettes
and Tarzan ice cream, and started a national network of Tarzan
clubs for young people. All Burroughs lacked, it would seem, was a
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The character Tarzan was born in 1912, swinging in on a jungle
vine to rescue the career of his own creator. Burroughs was 35,
married with two children, and possessed of a tenuous employment
history. He was most successful as head of the stenographic
department at Sears, Roebuck in Chicago, but inexplicably quit to
sell pencil sharpeners.
</P>
<P>
   After checking ads for his product in several pulp magazines, he
took them home to read. He decided he could write stories ``just as
rotten as theirs.'' His first story, ``A Princess of Mars,'' was
the tale of a soldier who falls into a trance in Arizona and wakes
up on Mars. The All-Story magazine bought it for $400.
</P>
<P>
   Burroughs's editor was eager for a sequel, and Burroughs wrote
back that he was working on another ``improbable'' tale: ``The
story I am now on is of the scion of a noble English house _ of the
present time _ who was born in tropical Africa where his parents
died when he was about a year old. The infant was found and adopted
by a huge she-ape, and was brought up among a band of fierce
anthropoids.'' In 1912, The All-Story bought his 504-page
manuscript for $700.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Taliaferro's biography seems overstuffed with details
of Burroughs's many plots, but taken together, they make their
point. Burroughs's writing is not all bad, and some of his
adventures are well paced and tightly structured. Too often,
however, he trots out threadbare literary devices. Most stories
feature scantily clad heroines who somehow remain pure, such as
Jane in the jungle or Dejah Thoris on Mars. Amnesia, trances,
mistaken identity, and improbable rescues are used again and again.
Burroughs's darker side comes through in his stories, as well. His
images of blacks are simple-minded and racist, and he wrote essays
advocating the extermination of ``moral imbeciles'' and the
deportation of Japanese-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Burroughs and his first wife, Emma, were movie buffs, and he was
determined to break into the fledgling film industry. The courtship
began in 1914, but Tarzan at first was considered too difficult to
film. The first release of ``Tarzan and the Apes'' came in 1918,
under William Parsons and the National Film Corp. (The famous MGM
version, starring Olympic swimmer Johnny Weissmuller and
20-year-old Maureen O'Sullivan, would not come out until 1932.)
Author and main character would never be the same, Taliaferro
writes.
</P>
<P>
   Taliaferro doesn't gloss over Burroughs's flaws and florid
prose, but in the end, he provides an incisive read about a rogue
who became one of the godfathers of pop culture and one of the
first explorers in the American celebrity jungle.

fueling a major portion of the nation's economic growth. By Seth

   Parkinson's disease is a cruel magician. It makes its victims
slowly disappear. It mutes their voices, erases their expressions,
robs them of their motor control. Finally, they freeze in a kind of
suspended animation, disappearing behind the blank stare of the
``Parkinson's mask.'' Although more people have Parkinson's than
multiple sclerosis, Lou Gehrig's disease and muscular dystrophy
combined, the disease has escaped much public notice and research
funding.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer has prepared a four-story package
on the diesease, its causes and possible breakthroughs in
treatment. The stories, written by Carol Smith, will move today for
use at will. All stories will move in the ``a'' category. Photos
and a three-column graphic explaining how Parkinson's disease works
are available on the Wieck database. If you have any questions,
please call Bob Schenet on the national-foreign desk at (206)
448-8158.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the stories:
</P>
<P>
   PARKINSON'S-DISEASE (Seattle) _ It is a disease that renders its
victims invisible, trapping them inside their houses, inside their
bodies, inside their minds, until they simply vanish to the rest of
us. ``Parkinson's has been called the silent epidemic,'' said Dr.
Donald Calne, a neurologist at the University of British Columbia
in Vancouver. And it's a growing one.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers are optimistic. Breakthroughs are on the horizon
that they hope will not only help Parkinson's patients, but also
will advance the understanding of other degenerative brain
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   PARKINSON'S-FOUNDATION (Seattle) _ Parkinson's disease can be
paralyzing, not just in its symptoms, but in its effects on family
members as well. Bill Bell and Craig Howard founded the Northwest
Parkinson's Foundation to help make it easier for patients and
families to get better answers about the disease.
</P>
<P>
   PARKINSON'S-PATIENT (Seattle) _ Paul Gladstone understands at a
more intimate level than most the anatomy of the damaged brain. As
a scientist, he is on working terms with the intricate molecular
pathways in the brain. He can describe what happens when neurons
die and neurotransmitters disappear. He details which circuits get
disrupted, which loops of neural programming get erased. As a
Parkinson's patient, he lives with the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   PARKINSON'S-BREAKTHROUGH (Seattle) _ Dr. Phil Ballard had seen
all sorts of bizarre patients in psychiatric emergency rooms. But
he'd never seen one like George Carillo. Ballard and his boss, Dr.
J. William Langston, set out to solve the mystery of one patient
and ended up making a major breakthrough in the study of
Parkinson's disease.

IMPROVED `OUT-OF-TOWNERS STILL FLOUNDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE OUT-OF-TOWNERS 
Directed by: Sam Weisman 
Screenplay by: Marc Lawrence (based on Neil Simon's screenplay) 
Starring: Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn, Mark McKinney, John Cleese 
Running time: 96 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (some sex and drug-related humor) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nobody is likely to accuse this ``Out-of-Towners'' remake of
desecrating a classic. The 1970 Neil Simon original about a married
couple chewed up by big bad Manhattan was both grating and tedious.
So this remake by Sam Weisman was in the coveted
nowhere-to-go-but-up mode. It doesn't go that far up, but it's
still an improvement on the original. Back then, Jack Lemmon and
Sandy Dennis played the unlucky couple. This time it's Steve Martin
and Goldie Hawn.
</P>
<P>
   They're operating under something of a handicap in that
Manhattan in 1970 was in much worse shape than the spruced-up and
less threatening Big Apple of the reinvigorated 1990s. But Martin
and Hawn are slightly better at deflecting us from the cold
mechanics of farce that ensue when everything goes wrong. They're
diverted to Boston, separated from their luggage, held up at
gunpoint and relieved of cash and credit cards and ID, rebuffed at
the hotel they're supposed to be staying at. Before long, they're
chased by police and thrown on the far from tender mercies of
Central Park at night. And all this on the eve of the morning he's
being interviewed for the big job he needs in order to stay
solvent.
</P>
<P>
   The original arose from Simon's own love-hate relationship with
New York. The answer to the Ohio couple's escalating troubles lay
in their learning to respond like New Yorkers and fight back.
Martin is a skilled farceur, although not so skilled that his
mechanics aren't at odds with the warmth that Hawn uses to work her
way around the heavy-duty contrivance that settles over the
proceedings like a noose. Still, there is chemistry between them,
even if it's only the chemistry of actors performing in sync rather
than that of characters who assume enough dimension to persuade us
they're interacting on any level.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the couple is supposed to be salvaging their
ennui-laden marriage as well as finding a new job to support it
strains credibility more than it adds to the farcical pressure. The
roadblocks they must hurdle are for the most part pretty flat ones,
except in the case of John Cleese, who calls upon a pocketful of
his ``Fawlty Towers'' moves as a snobby hotel manager who
sadistically power-trips the hapless couple until they find an
embarrassing way to strike back. He and everybody throw themselves
energetically at this unsympathetic material that paradoxically
grows more tepid the harder they hit it. ``The Out-of-Towners'' is
a decent try, competently executed, but it does make you wonder why
Hollywood bothers to remake flops when it hardly has figured out
how to remake hits.

 &HT;    U.S. SHORTCOMINGS AN OPEN SECRET IN KOSOVO CONFLICT
 &HT;    Eds: Corrects name of Kenneth Bacon in 5th graf.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Among the rules for war-making, one of the most
ancient is never to let the enemy know your weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kosovo conflict, however, U.S. shortcomings are so openly
discussed that one was featured in David Letterman's ``Late Night''
monologue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things could not be getting worse in the Balkans,'' quipped
the comic, drawing from a report that the U.S. Air Force is running
out of cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``A shortage of bombs? Well, hell, call CBS,'' he chortled in a
poke at his own network.
</P>
<P>
   The joke wins few laughs from military experts, who find it
troubling that the Pentagon has admitted that the U.S. arsenal is
down to its last 100 air-launched cruise missiles, the $1 million
bombs that can be programmed to fly to targets. Spokesman Kenneth
Bacon told reporters this week that the dwindling supply was
``something that we do worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a public concession ``is very unfortunate,'' said Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., in a telephone interview from New Hampshire this
week shortly before he delayed announcing his presidential campaign
because of the Kosovo conflict. ``I can't help thinking it might
serve to encourage (Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce A. Johnson, a scholar with the conservative Hudson
Institute, offered a harsher assessment. ``You've told the enemy,
'Hang in there, dude, we've only a few left to lob at you,' `` he
said. ``And it tells every other troublemaker in the world that the
United States has failed to build up its defensive arsenal of
weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the U.S. Navy still has thousands of smaller,
sea-launched cruise missiles that could accomplish much the same
purpose as the Air Force's cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   But talk of the shortage is only one part of the public
hand-wringing over limitations that has marked the first week and a
half of NATO action against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has all but ruled out ground forces for the
present, saying that ``it is not my intention'' to deploy them.
NATO officials have debated over whether to deploy low-flying A-10
attack planes. And for days the allies have pondered the dangers to
civilians if the allies bomb the defense ministry in downtown
Belgrade, even as its occupants were reported to be moving
operations to safer sites, possibly including a monastery.
</P>
<P>
   Such public discourse could increase risks to NATO forces, said
former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. ``I think the goal is to
complexify the problem for the enemy and not simplify it,'' he told
CNN on Thursday. ``And so when you begin to start ruling things
out, like ground troops, or say we're only going to hit these
targets and not those targets, the effect of that, it seems to me,
is to make the problem for the other side much simpler.''
</P>
<P>
   To other critics, the public disclosures are secondary effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bigger problem is there is no strategy,'' said Frank
Gaffney, who served as assistant defense secretary under President
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Gaffney said he was glad the public knows about problems such as
the cruise missile shortage. ``On balance, I think it's better for
the American people to know about this and catalyze them to take
corrective action,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the open debate is a stark contrast with the
first wave of air assaults against Iraq in the 1991 Persian Gulf
war, during which the U.S. forces kept a tight lid of secrecy on
much of their operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a different era where information flows freely,''
McCain said. ``Maybe after this conflict is over, we ought to look
at it and see whether it did any harm or not.''

`SOPRANOS' A KILLER SERIES WITH A SMART EDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE SOPRANOS 
Starring: James Gandolfini, Edie Falco, Michael Imperioli, Nancy
Marchand, Lorraine Bracco 
Created by: David Chase 
On: HBO 
Time: The season finale is Sunday at 9 p.m. The entire series will
be repeated Wednesdays at 9 p.m., beginning June 9. 
Rated: TVMA 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty-seven years after ``The Godfather,'' TV and the movies
are louzy with mob stories, from the schlocky wonders of ``The Last
Don II'' to the deze-dem-and-doze schtick of ``Analyze This.''
Recently, as evidence of the overripening of the wiseguy genre, we
got an unintentionally parodic TV movie called ``Bella Mafia'' that
hinged on lines like ``The papers, I want the papers,'' and a stale
remake of ``Gloria'' that had a big-haired, New Yawk-ified Sharon
Stone yelling, ``What's the matta wit you kid? You're buggin' me.''
Even Martin Scorsese's ``Casino'' succumbed to a plotline that was
as wobbly as the drugged-out Stone's high heels. And so if you had
wagered that the very finest and most addictive TV drama of this
season would be set in the bloody world of capos, car trunks, and
cannoli, I might have responded with a resounding
``Fuggedaboutit.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's no forgetting about ``The Sopranos,'' HBO's 13-part
series in which a New Jersey capo faces down depression and family
power shifts. The show, whose season finale airs Sunday at 9 p.m.,
has triumphed brilliantly over the cliches of an American genre
that is often considered to be the late-20th-century equivalent of
the Western. With sly Freudian wit and cultural realism, it has
ushered the image of mobsters into an era where Prozac is the new
boss and gangsters are doing turf battle with gangstas.
Miraculously, each episode of ``The Sopranos'' has managed to be
even better than the last, breaking that golden rule of series TV
that requires even the best dramas, from ``The Practice'' to
``ER,'' to be painfully uneven.
</P>
<P>
   The central gimmick of ``The Sopranos'' is that a made man is in
psychotherapy _ the same concept behind Robert De Niro's ``Analyze
This.'' But series creator David Chase has steered quite clear of
broad comedy, opting for a hybrid tone that only flirts with
laughter. Chase uses the therapy _ ``terapy,'' as Tony Soprano
calls it _ as a way into the human side of a mobster, and not as a
way to sendup psychobabble and Italian-Americans. ``The Sopranos''
pivots on the fact that, despite his growing power in the world of
crime, Tony Soprano is just another modern suburban man who needs
to examine his private life _ especially the cruelties of his
mother _ to find inner peace. Like ordinary law-abiding citizens,
he is subject to panic attacks, to midlife blues, to a pair of
growing children, and to a spouse who, like his mother, is always
unsatisfied by him. And because doctor-patient confidentiality does
not extend to homicide, Tony can only spend his sessions talking
about his murderous impulses, and not murder itself. On the couch,
if not on the street, he is like us.
</P>
<P>
   The hours with Dr. Melfi, and the subplots about Tony's home
life, make Tony into a more dimensional _ and less mythic _ mob
character than even Michael Corleone of ``The Godfather'' series.
While directors like Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola have
cultivated the larger-than-life, romanticized vision of organized
criminals as a sort of royalty, ``The Sopranos'' thrives on
demystifying the life, on giving the guys a two-bit local quality
that makes it easy to imagine running into them at a fast-food
joint. These goodfellas have vague attachments to the gentlemanly
honor code of the old world, but they really want to be like the
characters in the same mob movies we've all seen. The show has fun
making allusions to other mob fare, with a car horn that toots
``The Godfather'' theme song, a mobster doing imitations of Al
Pacino in ``The Godfather Part III,'' and a cameo by Scorsese.
</P>
<P>
   The show's writing is extraordinary, particularly as Tony's
relationship with his mother (who tries to have him whacked) lends
``The Sopranos'' the same undercurrent of Greek tragedy that
charged through ``The Grifters.'' The scripts flow smoothly from
the R-rated guy banter to the therapy sessions, which never seem
contrived, and all the plot strands come together slowly, without
any artificial force. It's the sort of writing you'll only find on
cable channels like HBO, not simply because the language is
authentic but because the themes are as unsettling as they are
intelligent. Only two or three moments in the season have fallen
flat, and each has involved Dr. Melfi's family, most notably when
her ex-husband delivers a speech about the stereotyping of
Italian-Americans. Also, a blackly comic subplot about crew member
Christopher, played with wired intensity by Michael Imperioli, was
cut short, even though it was rich enough to be a series in itself.
</P>
<P>
   As Tony, James Gandolfini is a revelation. One minute he's New
Jersey's own Fred Flintstone, the next he's Al Capone, but either
way you never lose sympathy with him. With the tiniest shifts in
his chunky face, and eyes that can recede into his lids, Gandolfini
moves seamlessly from pent-up violence and sexual desire to wounded
boyishness. In therapy, he resists self-examination with a tight
face, but at home with his wife, he expands on human behavior with
lines like, ``It's what they call negative attention getting.'' As
his wife, Carmela, Edie Falco is blond and brassy, with an
abrasiveness that is hard to resist as she dresses down a needy
priest on Sunday night. The showiest performance is by Nancy
Marchant as the whining, two-faced Livia, Tony's mother, who now
seems to be feigning senility to escape the consequences of her
actions. But the quieter actors in ``The Sopranos'' are no less
impressive, particularly Tony Sirico as Soprano crew member Paulie
Walnuts. On Sunday night, when he confesses to having seen a
therapist, he brings a wonderful grace to the simple lines, ``I had
some issues. Enough said.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, as thunder, lightning, and the FBI bring their wrath
down on Tony Soprano's New Jersey suburb, ``The Sopranos'' first
season comes to an end. But I have little doubt that most fans will
re-watch the entire series, which HBO will reair on Wednesdays
beginning June 9. The show has both cemented HBO's reputation as
the home of groundbreaking series like ``The Larry Sanders Show,''
and distinguished a TV season whose only watched new drama is
``Providence,'' a contrived soap opera that, surprisingly, has
nothing to do with the mob.

AARON'S 755 IS THE NUMBER TO SHOOT FOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only a few dare dream of surpassing Hank Aaron's career home run
record. The leading candidates are Mark McGwire and Ken Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   But time is already working against any heir apparent. The
pressures that face modern-day challengers are in some ways even
greater than those Aaron had to deal with. As his 23-year career
wound down and Aaron approached Babe Ruth's mark, he had to battle
racial bigotry and an ungrateful public. Aaron beat Ruth's
unbeatable record of 714 on April 8, 1974, and wound up with 755
home runs but didn't really get proper recognition until about 10
years after he retired in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Next Thursday, there will be a celebration in Atlanta
commemorating the 25th anniversary of Aaron's 715th home run. This
is a good time to ask whether someone can break his record.
</P>
<P>
   The problems for the new generation of sluggers are almost the
opposite of what Aaron faced. Thanks to the revival of 1998 _ led
by McGwire and Sammy Sosa, who both broke Roger Maris's
single-season homer record _ there is now enormous attention and
pressure focused on long-ball hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Sluggers are being signed to massive contracts and being called
The Franchise. With such windfalls, players don't have to play 20
years to amass financial fortunes. So would anyone hang around long
enough to break the mark?
</P>
<P>
   ``They could catch it in a hurry if they continue to hit home
runs the way they did last year _ 50, 60, 70,'' said Aaron. ``It's
a new situation. With me, it was never a matter of money. Even with
endorsements, I never made more than $500,000. Today's players are
going to make so much money that they don't really need to stay
around as long as I did. But I hope they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Among active players, McGwire leads with 457 home runs, and he
has hit 52, 58, and 70 in the last three seasons. He's only
starting his 13th full season, but he's 35 and has a history of
back problems.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron thinks the guy with the best shot is Griffey, who is only
29 and in 10 seasons already has 350 home runs. If he plays in the
right park _ he is due to become a free agent after the 2000 season
_ the record could fall before he is 40.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a long way off,'' said Griffey, who last year hit
56 homers to become only the third player to reach 50 in
consecutive seasons. ``All I know is that I have to be consistent
the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say that I will spend my entire career in Seattle or
how long I will play baseball. A lot of it has to do with how my
family feels and how I feel, should a decision have to be made.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's manager is Lou Piniella, who played against Aaron in
the 1970s. He agrees that his center fielder has the best chance at
the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's going to be done, he's the guy,'' said Piniella. ``The
one thing in his favor is that major league baseball has become
homer-friendly. In the prior era when Aaron, Willie Mays, and Ernie
Banks played, the ball was pumped once in a while, but mostly it
was dead. I don't think you'll see that again because people enjoy
seeing the ball leave the yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella thinks McGwire's destiny is somewhere in the 600 club;
all he has to do is stay healthy. Bonds needs to average 32 for
each of the next six years just to reach that level. Griffey could
get to 700 by averaging ``only'' 39 for the next nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that Griffey is capable of playing nine years,'' said
Piniella, ``and he loves to play the game. But then it always
becomes a question of how much a player wants it. Chasing a record
like that is something that could give some added incentive. But
everything has to come together _ the power, the experience, and
the thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   If someone is to break the record, he'll probably need another
player to push him, the way McGwire and Sosa pushed each other last
year. Aaron had competition in the 1950s and 1960s from Hall of
Famers such as Mays (660 career homers), Frank Robinson (586),
Harmon Killebrew (573), and Mickey Mantle (536). Aaron, Ruth, and
Mays are the only players to reach the 600 plateau.
</P>
<P>
   ``After my first five years, I had 165 home runs,'' said
Robinson. ``Hank started two years ahead of me and had only 140
after his first five. But once he started putting up the big
numbers, there was no catching him. The key was after age 30. The
rest of us started tailing off. Hank stayed consistent until the
'70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always wanted to keep pace with each other. That's just the
way it was. You'd read in the paper where Hank would hit a couple
or Willie had two more. That made you want to hit a couple. It was
friendly competition, not life or death. Remember, for a long time,
Mays was the top contender.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson agreed with Piniella that good health and
self-motivation _ not money _ will be the keys for future
challengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep talking about the salaries escalating, and how they
affect the future,'' said Robinson. ``Well, they're still going up.
It's still up to the individual if he wants to stay around. Players
have to be healthy and continue at a high level of hitting home
runs. That's what it is going to take, and I don't know how many
are willing to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone will surpass Aaron, said San Diego's Tony Gwynn, who
compares the home run chase to his pursuit of a .400 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll happen when the right guy comes along,'' said Gwynn.
``It has to be a guy who loves to play this game like they did in
the old days. He has to want that thrill that goes with just being
able to step out there and do what you do.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor with McGwire, added Gwynn, is how the Cardinals
do as a team. It's easy to forget that it was McGwire who set the
home run record but Sosa who was National League MVP, chiefly
because the Cubs made the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If his team had been in the hunt last year,'' said Gwynn, ``I
don't think they'd have pitched to McGwire the same way _ around,
careful, or not at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't matter with Hank. He was so good because he could
hit the ball all over the place no matter how the team was going.
Today, there are a lot of guys who hit from line to line. But do
they have the power?''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron never hit 50 homers in a season but he had 40 or more
eight times. He batted .300 or better 14 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to be remembered as a guy who could do more than just
hit home runs,'' said Aaron. ``I had an agenda. I always wanted to
do the best I could do, regardless of whether I was playing for a
team on the top or bottom. I thought that was my job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I can compare myself to today's hitters. The
best thing to come out of all of this is that not only did McGwire
and Sosa get the recognition they deserved, but what they
accomplished put baseball on the front pages again.''

BROADCASTERS' CALLS TURN HOMERS INTO HISTORY

   (itals)`It might be . . .''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   No three words ever expressed better the feeling evoked by the
crack of a bat. Harry Caray, the late Chicago Cubs announcer, must
have said those words a thousand times. Didn't matter. At the
moment bat met ball, they signaled hope, if only for a fraction of
a second sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)``It could be . . .''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Home runs can be foiled by winds, foul lines, and miraculous
stabs by leaping outfielders. Even the sweetest of swings is not
immune from the laws of nature and defensive aptitude. But when the
ball stayed on its path, when the outfielder finally surrendered to
the inevitable, Caray captured a complicated act of physics quite
simply. And with a little relish.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)``It is! A home run! Holy cow!''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Former Red Sox voice Ned Martin wasn't as flamboyant. As a
matter of fact, he was one of the most literate men ever to work in
a booth. But even he was moved to the spiritual when a significant
shot was hit by a Boston batter, exclaiming, ``Mercy!''
</P>
<P>
   Red Barber, the longtime Dodgers announcer, would summon a mere
mortal: ``Ooooohhhh, doctor.'' One of Barber's most famous calls
occurred during Game 6 of the 1947 World Series. The Yankees were a
game up on Brooklyn but trailed, 8-5, in the bottom of the sixth.
With two on, Joe DiMaggio hit a towering shot, and it looked as
though the score would be tied. But substitute outfielder Al
Gionfriddo sprinted ``back, back, back,'' as Barber called it,
until he caught the ball at the bullpen fence some 415 feet from
home. It was one of the few times that DiMaggio showed any emotion,
kicking the dirt as he neared second base.
</P>
<P>
   About a decade ago, ESPN's Chris Berman heard a replay of
Barber's call on the radio as he drove to work in Bristol, Conn.
Berman got an idea. He thought Barber's words would give a little
life, a little suspense, to his own highlight calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd try it,'' Berman said. ``I wasn't trying to
mimic him or have a catchphrase. I just liked it. It was a famous
call. It was history. So I just did it that night.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman has been saying, ``back, back, back, back, back . . .''
ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best part about it is that it describes the game,'' Berman
said. ``I'm not telling anyone that it's a home run yet. It could
be, `Back, back, back . . . caught on the warning track.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Berman doesn't use what has become his trademark on every home
run. ``You gotta be careful,'' Berman said. ``You never want to
outdo the actual act. But there are so many highlight shows and
games on television, everyone seems to want to top the next guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox announcer Joe Buck realized as much when he prepared for the
moment when Mark McGwire would beat Roger Maris's record. His
father, Jack Buck, had already made some of the more memorable
calls in baseball history. For instance, young Buck heard his
father call the first game of the 1988 World Series, when an ailing
Kirk Gibson smashed the game-winner off ace A's reliever Dennis
Eckersley. ``I don't believe what I just saw,'' Jack Buck said as
Gibson rounded the bases pumping his fists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funny thing about home run calls is that it seems the more
memorable ones are the spontaneous ones,'' Joe Buck said.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case with McGwire's 62d. Buck could not help
jotting down a few words the night before. ``I thought I knew what
I was going to say,'' Buck said. ``I had a little script, something
like, `McGwire rounds the bases and floats into the history books.'
''
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing Buck didn't stick with his script. When
McGwire belted that line drive over the fence last September, the
slugger missed touching first as he rounded the bases. ``Down the
left-field line!'' Buck started. ``Is it enough? Gone! There it is!
62! Touch first, Mark, you are the new single-season home run
king.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's Jon Miller called the McGwire homer that tied Maris. He,
too, prepared some words but ended up not using them. ``My style is
to try and capture what's right for the moment,'' Miller said.
``You can't plan that out.''

INJURY-PRONE GLENN SHAPING UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ He was asked how it came to be that he was
turning over a new leaf and committing to the offseason
conditioning program. And the answer he gave was _ as his answers
usually are _ honest, direct, and critical of himself.
</P>
<P>
   He came upon the decision on his own. The decision was made by
Terry Glenn, and only Terry Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take it day to day, but I will say I plan on being around
here for the duration of the workouts,'' Glenn said Thursday.
``Last couple of seasons I've been doing things on my own and I
don't think it got me anywhere. And I'm really looking for a change
right now and I think I just have to get back to the basics like
when I was in high school and in college where I work out
throughout the whole offseason. It'll work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said he's been thinking about committing to the program
for a while. He said it hit him as he was being carried off the
field in St. Louis last December after breaking his ankle, a freak
accident that had nothing to do with conditioning. Still he
wondered if a stronger body would prevent the injuries that have
plagued him, including a nagging hamstring problem. He also has
received encouragement from his friend and agent, Jim Gould, and
Patriots coach Pete Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sitting around and seeing guys like Ty Law and Lawyer Milloy
and guys going to the Pro Bowl, it hurt me to see that,'' Glenn
said. ``It hurt me more to not be there for my team in the
playoffs. I think they really needed me when we really had a chance
in Jacksonville if I was playing. Seeing those things happen it
just changed my attitude. Right now this is my third day (of
working out). Consistency is the key word. Last year and the year
before that, I worked out a lot but it wasn't consistent and that's
the key.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody had to convince me. It's a matter of common sense. I
had a great season in high school and college and we always worked
out through the entire offseason. I never had problems like that
before. Those two years when I had those problems, I was on my own.
Now I'm ready to get back here and back to the basics.''
</P>
<P>
   Why did Glenn feel the need to be on his own the past two
offseasons?
</P>
<P>
   ``In college you have a sense of family,'' he said. ``You're
there. It's almost like you're in jail. When you get here, you have
all this money and you're on your own, you get to make your own
decisions and you don't have anyone telling you what to do. For a
guy my age and the things I've been through, I wanted to run and
experience that. It got me nowhere. Put it like this, I've
experienced that and now I'm ready to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said doctors have told him the right ankle fracture is
making solid progress. He has weighed in at 195, and has begun to
work with conditioning coach Johnny Parker in the weight room.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I like to be around this time so when I start
working out and get my body fat down, I can kind of trim it off and
be what I want to be,'' said Glenn, whose playing weight is listed
as 185.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said he doesn't know whether the team will recommend he
see a hamstring specialist to help avoid a recurrence of that
injury, as they have with Willie McGinest and his groin problem.
The team has purchased special equipment to help prevent the rash
of injuries that plagued the team last season.
</P>
<P>
   With his history of health problems, Glenn now seems to
understand what it takes to prepare himself. Even though he
contends he was in top shape when he arrived at training camp last
July, he admits, ``You have to tone your body for a while to where
it becomes almost like cement. I kind of was working out, took time
off, and then worked out again and I didn't give my body a chance
to be solid for a long time. By being consistent, it will do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn also says he is motivated by criticism about his
commitment to the game and the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear it all the time,'' he said. ``I can't go anywhere
without someone saying, `Hey, you need to be here,' like it's my
father. It really upsets me, but there's nothing I can do about it.
Hearing that over and over again, you get tired of it. I just want
to quiet it all down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, I think I have something to prove to myself and that's
the main thing that I have with everything. If I want to prove
something to myself and get something done, it'll take care of the
rest.''
</P>
<P>
   After missing nine games last season, Glenn has a simple goal
for '99: play them all.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn knows his importance to the team and the numbers bear it
out. Over his three-year career, the Patriots are 23-11 with Glenn,
7-7 without him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't touched any part of my confidence,'' said Glenn. ``I
still think I'm one of the best wide receivers out there. If I can
stay on the field and prove it, I will show myself and to y'all
that I am one of the best ones out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet over the past two seasons, Keyshawn Johnson, Eric Moulds,
and even Marvin Harrison _ all drafted in the first round of the
1996 draft when Glenn was taken seventh overall _ have surpassed
his production. That has changed the perception of Glenn in the
eyes of some.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's changed from you guys' perspective and their (the
receivers') perspective, but from my perspective, no,'' Glenn said.
``I still feel I'm better and I have something to prove. Once I'm
out there for the long part of the season, I'll prove that.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said he soon will submit a plan to Carroll about how he
thinks he's best utilized in practice and in games. ``I have a plan
I will approach Pete with. If he likes it, fine; if he doesn't,
I'll do what Coach Carroll says.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn also wants to take on a leadership role. He's been a
talented player who has pretty much kept to himself. He's grown up
in the NFL with a locker right next to Ben Coates, who rarely
speaks to the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my fourth year. I'm getting older. I've seen a lot and
been through a lot,'' Glenn said. ``And I feel I have a chance to
put my input on this team. Before I was quiet and didn't say too
much and now I know more of what's going on and the people here. We
have a great nucleus of guys that went to the Super Bowl. We have a
key group with talented DBs and Willie McGinest and receivers who
have been here a long time. Drew (Bledsoe) has made a great jump
from my rookie year until now. I'm excited about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Often kidding and smiling, Glenn was asked how many catches he'd
like to have by the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go with how many games,'' he said.

HOW TED GRABBED AN EEPHUS PITCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; (The Globe will periodically look back at memorable midsummer
classics, leading up to the July 13 All-Star Game at Fenway Park.)
</P>
<P>
   If he threw it today, when it could be shown endlessly on TV
replays and dissected on the Internet, Rip Sewell's trick pitch
would hardly rank as a novelty.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1946, Sewell's ``eephus'' pitch, an exaggerated lob that
made it look like it was shot out of a mortar, was still known only
to a limited number of baseball fans.
</P>
<P>
   That was before Ted Williams _ ``a grim, determined, unshaven
Ted Williams,'' according to Gerry Moore of the Boston Globe _ gave
the eephus lasting fame when he hit one of them into the bullpen in
Fenway Park during the 1946 All-Star Game, won by the American
League, 12-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, that was my first look at the eephus or oophus or
whatever you call it,'' Williams said after one of the most
memorable batting shows in All-Star history, one that included a
second homer, two singles, a walk, and five RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the greatest exhibition of hitting I've ever seen,''
said National League manager Charlie Grimm, whose squad had fewer
hits (three) than Williams did, and all three were singles.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Williams said it couldn't compare with his game-winning
shot in the 1941 All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, who would go on to win the pennant in 1946 before
losing the World Series in seven games to the St. Louis Cardinals,
placed eight players on that All-Star team. One of them was Johnny
Pesky, who said Williams was not in the batter's box when he hit
Sewell's eephus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first one Sewell threw was high,'' Pesky recalled. ``The
crowd went `Oooooh.' You know how crowds are. That pitch went up
like 25, 30 feet in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Williams then moved up in the box, and the next one he hit it
out of the park, but he was out of the batter's box.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a front-page photo in the Globe shows that Williams's
right foot had crossed the white line marking the front of the
batter's box. Technically, Williams could have been called out.
</P>
<P>
   Pesky's recollection of the pitch sequence was a little hazy.
Sewell said he warned Williams in advance that he would throw the
pitch to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the game, Ted said to me, `Hey, Rip, you wouldn't throw
that damned crazy pitch in a game like this, would you?' '' Sewell
would say afterward.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Sure,' I said. `I'm gonna throw it to you.'
</P>
<P>
   `` `Man' he said. `Don't throw that ball in a game like this.'
</P>
<P>
   `` `I'm gonna throw it to you, Ted,' I said. `So look out.' ''
</P>
<P>
   When Sewell threw his first blooper, he disguised it by
releasing it with the same motion as his fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He swung from Port Arthur,'' Sewell recalled, ``and just
fouled it off the tip of his bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Sewell advised The Kid that another was coming but missed
outside. He then surprised Williams with a fastball strike, then
came back with the eephus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good one, dropping right down the chute for a
strike,'' Sewell said. ``He took a couple of steps on it _ which
was the right way to attack that pitch, incidentally _ and he hit
it right out of there. And I mean he hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   The ball landed in the American League bullpen, where it was
caught on the fly by Red Sox pitcher Mickey Harris, who never got
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, the fans stood up and they went crazy,'' Sewell
recalled. ``I walked around the base lines with Ted, talking to
him. `Yeah,' I told him, `the only reason you hit it is because I
told you it was coming.' He was laughing all the way around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a standing ovation when I walked off the mound after
that inning. We'd turned a dead turkey of a ballgame into a real
crowd pleaser.''
</P>
<P>
   According to newspaper accounts, neighborhood kids in Williams's
hometown of San Diego rushed to tell Williams's mother that her son
had hit a ``balloon ball'' out of the park.
</P>
<P>
   Williams's first home run in the game came off Kirby Higbe of
the Pirates and landed in the center-field bleachers. He also had
singles off Higbe and Ewell Blackwell of the Reds before coming to
the plate with the score 8-0 in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That pitch was really something to see,'' Pesky said. ``He
used it a lot in the other league. Comical is what it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Truett Banks ``Rip'' Sewell, who hailed from Decatur, Ala.,
broke into the big leagues with the Tigers in 1932, then pitched
for the Pirates from 1938 until his retirement in 1949. A
6-foot-1-inch, 180-pound righthander, he won 143 games and lost 97.
Sewell, who died 10 years ago, was 39 years old when he faced
Williams, who was a month shy of his 28th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, Sewell would say later, was the only player ever to
hit a home run on an eephus pitch.

ESPN TARGETS THE STRIKE ZONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baseball season opens with a new and an old problem.
</P>
<P>
   The new problem is the strike zone and the technological
challenges it presents to network broadcasters. The old one is the
fine line between objectivity and boosterism among announcers.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN baseball producer Tim Scanlon said the recent controversy
over the strike zone prompted the network to investigate ways to
show viewers the differences in calls by umpires. But getting those
shots is difficult largely because of the distortions created by
present camera angles.
</P>
<P>
   Overhead shots show the ball in relation to home plate. Shots
from behind home or those from along the baselines show the ball in
relation to the batter. The problem is how to capture the ball, the
batter, and the plate in their true spatial relationship. Throw in
the different dimensions of ballparks, and producing a strike zone
standard for broadcasters is even more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Scanlon said ESPN will have some sort of solution in time for
playoffs. As it is, ESPN and Fox have improved their specialty
cameras, including ``maskcam,'' the tiny one that attaches to a
catcher's mask. ESPN has also tinkered with its graphics that give
bat and pitch speed, not to second-guess umpires' calls but to
illustrate the battle between pitchers and hitters.
</P>
<P>
   The old problem with homers in the booth resurfaced recently
when the New York Mets fired outspoken analyst Tim McCarver and
replaced him with Tom Seaver, who is also joining the team's
front-office staff. The move was considered to be a blow to
objectivity because McCarver, who had called Mets games for 16
seasons, was often critical of team management, coaches, and
players. Some Mets officials suggested that McCarver's criticism
reduced ticket sales. McCarver was subsequently hired by the New
York Yankees, but the issue caused an outpouring of support for
calling it the way it is.
</P>
<P>
   Sean McDonough, another candid announcer, has called Red Sox
games for the last 11 years and can't recall a time when ownership
questioned anything he has said on air. ``Without any fear of
contradiction, I can honestly say that I have never thought about
where my paycheck comes from when working a game,'' McDonough said.
``If all an announcer does is praise people, then it really doesn't
mean anything after a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox announcer Joe Buck agreed. ``McCarver was true to how he
felt,'' Buck said. ``He didn't let his paycheck dictate what he
told viewers. He was just being honest. And fans can see right
though anything else. If you lie to them when things are going bad,
then they are not going to believe you when things are going
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that pulling for the home team is a bad thing. But there are
limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally get turned off when I hear an announcer say `We'
need a hit or `We' have to score a run,'' McDonough said. ``But I
don't think there's any question that the fans know that I am
happier when the Red Sox win.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's 10th season of major league baseball coverage begins
Sunday night when Colorado plays San Diego in Monterrey, Mexico.
ESPN will have a tripleheader Monday starting at 4 p.m.

HITTING IT BIG IN THE MECCA OF BASEBALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: With COOPERSTOWN-IF-GO))  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ The point is made right away in the lobby,
just past where you walk through the stadium-style turnstiles. All
that needs to be said is done with a few jerseys, bats, balls and
box scores. Subtle it's not.
</P>
<P>
   These artifacts in the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum
are not of decades gone by, but of the season past. They belonged
to Sosa and McGwire and Maris, the stoic flat-topped ghost, and the
Great American Home Run Chase of 1998. That sound you think you
hear as you walk by are the sighs of relief of a game, industry and
town.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is back. Cooperstown is back. How far did it have to
come? Well, remember spring 1995? The regulars were still on
strike, and a group of has-beens, never-weres and out-and-out
dreamers were in major-league uniforms, a bunch of Garth Brookses
without the musical talent. Fans had grown justifiably cynical, and
even the place where we allow nostalgia to reign unchecked
suffered.
</P>
<P>
   We sometimes forget the mysticism for many that surrounds this
place on Lake Otsego in the village founded by the father of author
James Fenimore Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, the village, the Hall, its designation as the
birthplace of baseball _ all of it is built on a fable. If you
believe Cooperstown really was the place baseball was born, ask
yourself this: Why is Alexander Cartwright, who codified the game,
enshrined in the Hall of Fame, but Abner Doubleday, the reputed
inventor, is not? The answer is, it doesn't matter. It never did.
As Milwaukee Journal writer Dan Chabot once noted: ``Lemmings head
for the sea. The swallows come back to Capistrano. The buzzards
somehow find their way to Hinckley, Ohio. The geese follow their
instincts south. And baseball fans go to Cooperstown and the
National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.''
</P>
<P>
   But the strike of 1994 scarred Cooperstown. Attendance at the
Hall dropped 30 percent over four years. We were so bitter about
everything and everyone surrounding the game that even the most
dreamy-eyed had to admit it was and is a business first. Once
conceded, it took time, but those disgruntled fans are back
(attendance was up 16 percent last year over 1997). Cooperstown has
retained its place as a shrine.
</P>
<P>
   Cooperstown is not a place to be studied, although surely it is,
as much as it is there to be absorbed. Start as you drive past the
lake, into the village and its stunning stream of Victorian homes.
Turn onto Main Street, and you are struck that, baseball aside,
this could be a picture-perfect Anytown USA, if Anytown USA still
had vibrant downtown Main Streets _ and more than 300,000 visitors
a year.
</P>
<P>
   Main Street, Cooperstown, with its endless baseball-related
shops, signs and pilgrims, and the sidewalks where Cobb and
DiMaggio and even the singular Babe once strolled. As a fan you
can't help but feel them, or at least try.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is a game dominated by vital ghosts,'' Richard Gilman
once said. ``It's a fraternity, like no other we have, of the
active and the no longer so, the living and the dead.'' To your
right, you catch a glimpse of The Sandlot Kid, a statue embodying
the myth, and Doubleday Field, the tiny old-style brick stadium
with wooden bleachers that always stood as a testament to
magnificence in simplicity, something the stadium builders of the
major leagues didn't catch onto until the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Then there it is, on the right, the National Baseball Hall of
Fame and Museum. Anticipation crests just before you go in, and see
the uniforms, bats and helmets of Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa. Stay
and soak it in, but not too long. You have just started.
</P>
<P>
   A first visit to the Hall is intimidating; three floors and
150-plus years to grasp, not to mention a library open to the
public (by appointment) which could fill a lifetime's research. It
is all indomitable. Don't try.
</P>
<P>
   Luxuriate in the little things. For example, linger in the art
gallery, whose sole consistent theme is subject, and may be the
only exhibit anywhere to feature works by Andy Warhol, Norman
Rockwell and LeRoy Nieman in the same room.
</P>
<P>
   Take time to decipher the box score of the longest game ever, a
33-inning marathon between Pawtucket and Rochester, a 1981
minor-league classic. Yes, those kids are Cal Ripken Jr. and Wade
Boggs.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, save time for the Gallery and the plaques of its 237
inductees. But first for true laughs, ponder the evolution of the
uniform, particularly the 1976 Chicago White Sox concoction of
polyester shorts with a pull-over shirt featuring a collar akin to
an F-15's wingspan. That, kids, was the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Great American Home Run Chase (the name is
quasi-official), new exhibits include a tribute to the 1998 World
Series champion New York Yankees. New plaques will be unveiled late
this year to coincide with the annual induction ceremony that will
take place Sunday, July 25. It will feature one of the most
impressive casts in years: Nolan Ryan, George Brett, Robin Yount,
Orlando Cepeda, former umpire Nestor Chylak, Negro leaguer Smokey
Joe Williams and turn-of-the-century manager Frank Selee.
</P>
<P>
   This is a place of history, American history; therefore, the
triumphs are offset somewhat by the transgressions. Cap Anson may
be a Hall-of-Famer, but he is also the man most responsible for the
game's segregation (yes, there were black major-leaguers before
Jackie Robinson, albeit in the 1800s). From the Negro Leagues to
World War II to westward expansion, baseball mirrored a nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever wants to know the heart and mind of America,'' Jacques
Barzun wrote in 1954, ``had better learn baseball.'' This is where
you learn.

SPRING RITE FOR SKIERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My friend Jack has not skied down Tuckerman Ravine on Mount
Washington for a few years, but still athletically trim in his
mid-60s, he could if he wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   For some, though, the Washington trek is a spring ritual that
still rings as a college pilgrimage. And, it is one of those
experiences worth having once or twice, though few _ I am guessing
here _ repeat it very often. Perhaps once again as a midlife
statement.
</P>
<P>
   When Jack and his buddy from Brown went, a case of beer cost
about $4. They would pack all this beer with their skis and labor
it up the fire trail to ``Howard Johnsons.'' Then they would climb
up into the ravine where they stuck beer bottles in the snow, skied
for a while, and waited for midday.
</P>
<P>
   The spring sun at mile-high altitiude soon did its work, and
Jack and his buddy were able to sell their beer at the confiscatory
price of a buck a bottle. There are times, they knew, when no price
is too high for a cold beer, and the enterprise paid for their
trip, including gas and food.
</P>
<P>
   I have heard of other college kids selling beer at Tuckerman in
spring, but Jack had another move I hadn't heard of before, and a
sure comment on the passing times.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we skied,'' he said, ``we went into the woods and stuck
our skis in the snow against a tree. When we'd come back next time
_ maybe a couple of weeks _ we'd go in and get our skis. They were
always there.''
</P>
<P>
   Just try to leave your new $700 Volants leaning on a tree in the
woods when you leave the slopes at day's end!
</P>
<P>
   The times may change, certainly skis have, but Tuckerman Ravine
this spring is still the ritual for snow-worshippers the world
around. In fact, despite the so-so winter for snow at most of the
ski areas, Washington this spring promises to send forth excellent
conditions, according to Lewis Baldwin, trail information director
for the Appalachian Mountain Club in Pinkham Notch.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Wednesday) was one of the best days in a long time,'' said
Baldwin. ``The sun warmed the snow up just enough so you could ski
from the summit all the way to the parking lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Conditions vary day to day. Thursday, for instance, the
temperature remained just about 10 degrees cooler than Wednesday,
making the snow harder to ski on. A crust over the surface freezes
footprints and ridges that the skis can't edge through.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go up there about five days a year on a good season,'' said
Doug Gary, who skis with his brother, Ray. ``The real heart of the
Washington season begins about mid-April and runs through the end
of the month.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, when some of the largest crowds show up, the sun gets so
intense that big sheets of ice and boulders get loosened in the
melting, and large crevasses open up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be dangerous late in the season,'' said Baldwin, who
works at the Pinkham Notch Lodge, where skiers and hikers can rent
rooms at a daily rate. ``The ice separates from rock in huge
chunks.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, a young woman was killed by one such ice chunk as
it careened down the slope.
</P>
<P>
   Gary has climbed the mountain at least one day every spring
since his own Dartmouth days in the early 1960s. ``My father used
to tell stories about skinning up the mountains to ski in the '30s.
As crazy as it sounds, it all seemed kind of purist and romantic to
me. So whenever Ray and I make the climb up, we kind of share a
memory of Pop. Washington puts you in touch with the real early
days of skiing.''
</P>
<P>
   But if skiers these days are soft, looking for high-speed quad
lifts, groomed slopes, and a place to stop and sip hot chocolate at
the summit, who are all those skiers and boarders making the
mile-plus climb with a heavy pack, skis, and ski boots?
</P>
<P>
   ``Last weekend we had about a thousand skiers up there,'' said
Baldwin. ``On a really busy day there might be 3,000.''
</P>
<P>
   The very biggest day, he said, some 5,000 skiers made the
pilgrimage to skiing's holy temple, about the number who ski on
Sugarloaf on a busy day.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious bit of advice for neophytes is go with an
experienced skier, someone who has made the climb before.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a person has only skied in a regular ski area, they'll find
this very different,'' said Baldwin. ``It's open and not
controlled. There are rocks everywhere, open crevasses, avalanche
danger . . . a lot of things skiers usually never have to think
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, the skill level begins with intermediates, and
ranges to expert, depending on how high a skier climbs and which
slopes he skis. And, despite the rawness of the surface, the most
daunting element facing Mount Washingtoneers is the changeability
of the weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what it feels like down below in the spring,'' said
Baldwin, ``it can always turn to midwinter up on the mountain.
People should bring plenty of clothes, food, and water in pack.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Gary: ``You've heard it all before. It's the old Boy Scouts
`Be prepared.' The first time you ever get caught up in the exposed
areas without enough clothes, you never forget those two little
words again. They loom mighty large on Mount Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, said Baldwin, the avalanche danger is low on the
mountain, but climbers should check with either the Forest Service
or AMC both for avalanche danger and local weather.

<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ The quaint town is in fact a giant theme
park, from its diners with baseball wallpaper you would have killed
for as a kid to the shops that offer everything related to the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is not Disneyfied. Cooperstown can be enjoyed for what
it is, a comfortable upstate New York village built for strolling
its sidewalks, without even mentioning the B-word.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, here is a novel notion: You can go to Cooperstown, not
like baseball and actually find something else to do. In fact, it's
not even all that hard.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a stop at the Hall is recommended, 888-HALL-OF-FAME,
or www.baseballhalloffame.org. But if not, start with the Farmer's
Museum, 607-547-1450, one mile from the center of town. A working
replica of a 19th-century farmstead, the museum features skilled
artisans and crafts.
</P>
<P>
   The Fenimore House Museum 607-547-1400, a 1930s Georgian mansion
with terraced gardens overlooking Otsego Lake, features annually
rotated American art.
</P>
<P>
   Glimmerglass Opera, 607-547-2255, in season July and August,
offers world-class music.
</P>
<P>
   For another European taste, try the Brewery Ommegang,
800-656-1212, where Belgian beer is brewed.
</P>
<P>
   Cooperstown is the home of baseball, but a half-hour away is a
rival: the National Soccer Hall of Fame, 607-432-3351. But no one
claims soccer was born in Oneonta.

ABUSE SYNDROME DEFENSE ON TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They went to one bar, and another, followed by another. One
drink became two, became three. And as so often happened in
Kathleen Barrett's nine-year marriage, the conversation with her
husband, the entire night, quickly descended into the throes of
another bitter fight.
</P>
<P>
   Bitter enough, in fact, that sometime around 1 a.m. Jan. 23, her
husband stormed out of the Kihei Restaurant in Walpole, Mass.,
saying that he would walk to the couple's Foxborough home however
many miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen became nervous, even scared. She got into their blue
Toyota sedan and launched her search for him along the winding,
darkened roads of these southwestern suburbs. In the town of
Norfolk, a police officer saw her swerve over the middle line of
Union Street, pulled her over, and arrested her for drunk driving.
</P>
<P>
   That seemingly routine arrest on the backroads of a leafy town
now serves as the inauspicious start of a potentially landmark
legal case that is already attracting national attention. For the
first time in anyone's memory, a defendant to a lesser crime _ in
this case, drunk driving _ has injected a variation of the
controversial battered women's syndrome, taking her plea for help
to a jury of her peers.
</P>
<P>
   The jury's decision? First, the contrasting cases.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett, a 35-year-old floral designer, argued that she was
never drunk on the roads that night. Rather, she harbored a
horrible secret about her relationship with her husband _ a secret
common to too many women in too many households where no one would
ever suspect anything was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Barrett's lawyer, Victor Sloan, told a six-person jury
last month that his client was a longtime victim of domestic abuse.
As Kathleen Barrett drove in her search, she feared that her
husband would arrive home to their mint-colored house after a long,
cold walk and beat her anew. As she was driving, she wasn't drunk,
but frightened, unable to properly operate the car or pass a field
sobriety test because of fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason for impairment wasn't the alchohol,'' said Sloan.
``It was something else that affected her mind. It just so happened
she was a battered woman for nine years of marriage. That affected
the way she drove, the way she did the tests. She wasn't
concentrating. She was just worried about getting out of there soon
and finding him.''
</P>
<P>
   The argument was, in many ways, a novel and brilliant twist on
the so-called battered women's syndrome, which allows female
defendants to pursue a strategy of self-defense, including evidence
of prior beatings, in cases in which they have killed their abusive
husbands or partners. In 1994, the state Supreme Judicial Court
specifically gave credence to the strategy, ruling such prior
evidence of abuse is admissible.
</P>
<P>
   Battered women's advocates agree wholeheartedly. ``The issue of
domestic violence colored and affected something she did,'' said
Sylvia Guthrie, director of development for Jane Doe Inc., a
coalition of advocacy groups.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan was able to support Kathleen Barrett's case of abuse by
pointing to a prior restraining order. When the case went to trial
on March 18, her husband, Daniel, also had two counts of assault
pending against him from an incident on Feb. 21. The alleged
victims: his wife, Kathleen, and their son. Daniel Barrett did not
return a telephone call Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, stuck in the awkward position of prosecuting the
wife for drunk driving and her husband for assault, pursued the
case for a variety of reasons. First, Kathleen Barrett had a

THE PRICE OF FECKLESS LEADERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Endgame.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, the war in Kosovo is over. The Serbs have won. By
this time next week, most if not all of northern Kosovo will have
been ``ethnically cleansed.'' Shortly thereafter, through
diplomatic back channels, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
will initiate a ``peace conference.'' And President Clinton will
take whatever he can get and get out.
</P>
<P>
   NATO aerial assaults will have greater success as the weather
improves. But the bombing lacked intensity at its commencement and
has never carried with it the credible threat of ground assault.
Absent that threat, mobile Serbian forces have been able to conduct
their slaughter at will.
</P>
<P>
   At the peace conference, Milosevic will be happy to spit back
territory in southern Kosovo that he neither cares about nor needs.
He'll call it a concession and perhaps throw in the kidnapped US
infantrymen as a gesture of ``good will.'' Clinton will take that,
too. He cut and ran in Somalia. He'll cut and run in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of any other outcome is increasingly remote.
Even if the president goes forward with the deployment of ground
troops, the Pentagon would insist (and properly so) that he do so
in massive numbers. It would take months to put together an
operation involving 200,000 or 300,000 US troops.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Serbian troops would be entrenched in Kosovo,
would have mined every inch of border and would control the high
ground at every strategic location. The cost in US lives to recover
such heavily fortified territory would rise accordingly. President
Clinton is unlikely, to say the least, to stake his sacred approval
rating on such a protracted military commitment. His motto has
always been: ``Better to spin than stand.''
</P>
<P>
   And everybody knows it. This week brought the spectacle of some
of the president's top military and national security advisers
bickering over who is responsible for the debacle. The director of
the Central Intelligence Agency, ranking officers at the Pentagon,
high-ranking officials at the State Department, and top personnel
at the National Security Council all engaged in the finger-pointing
and blame assessment.
</P>
<P>
   According to news accounts, the president fully expected the
bombing campaign to drive Milosevic back to the bargaining table.
When it instead only intensified the genocide, Clinton was left to
complain of bad weather and bad luck. There was no Plan B. There
was only Plan A and Plan A squared.
</P>
<P>
   There will never be a Plan B. In an interview with CBS News, the
president insisted that despite the bad weather and the leisurely
pace of the sorties, the bombing campaign would eventually turn the
tide. ``I have embraced a strategy here that I believe has a
reasonably good chance of succeeding. Maybe even a better chance
than that,'' he said, ``knowing that we have more and more steel,
and will, and determination, and unity, from all of our NATO
allies.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's spin seemed almost delusional, in light of what
has been published in his local newspaper. The Supreme Commander of
NATO forces, US General Wesley Clark, said publicly this week that
the aerial bombardment campaign by itself could not turn the tide.
Meanwhile, NATO's supposed steel and will were such that it took
eight hours of intense negotiations to approve a stepped-up bombing
campaign, something that should have been approved from the start.
During those negotiations, according to published reports, it was
clear to all involved that NATO would never reach agreement on the
deployment of ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton chose to commit the prestige of the United
States and some of its best men and women to help alleviate almost
unimaginable suffering in the Balkans. It was not in the national
security interest of the United States to do so, but he did it
anyway because he believed that it might forestall a chain reaction
of events that could pose a direct threat to peace in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Reasonable men and women can disagree about his decision, but it
was not irrational. Having made it, however, Clinton failed to meet
its requirements. He now imagines that it will all work out in the
end. His sycophants, fearful of his wrath, concur.
</P>
<P>
   And so the disaster unfolds. Milosevic has already accomplished
most of what he set out to do. He now begins his exit strategy,
which is to get the US out so that he might regroup and reconfigure
his forces for the next campaign. Clinton has no exit strategy. He
must take what he is given,
</P>
<P>
   which, if Milosevic is smart, will be just enough for Clinton to
spin as stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   The watching world will learn a new lesson, which is that the
iron fist of the United States doesn't pack much punch. Homicidal
gangsters have hamstrung the most powerful military force in human
history. This is Clinton's national security legacy. This is his
bridge to the 21st century. This is the cost of feckless
leadership.

FORMER WELFARE RECIPIENTS LOSING HEALTH INSURANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 4)   (EDs: FIXES the word health in 9th graf and CORRECTS spelling of
Yacknin's name in last graf.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite a painful, crippling disease, Eva Amey of
Elmira, N.Y. got herself off welfare more than a year ago and has
become a teacher's aide working with handicapped high school
students.
</P>
<P>
   Amey, 32, earns $5,756 a year and lives with her three children
and second husband, a local highway department worker, in a
two-room apartment. Her medical bills often run $500 and sometimes
$1,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The bills weren't a problem as long as she remained on Medicaid,
the joint state-federal that serves 36 million low-income people.
Federal law permitted Medicaid recipients leaving welfare for work
to keep the benefit for a year.
</P>
<P>
   But a paperwork snafu ended her Medicaid coverage last October.
By the time Amey got a lawyer and appealed, she found out her
year's worth of Medicaid had expired. Limited medical insurance
through her school-aide position would hardly make a dent in her
costs. With the salary of her husband, a temporary worker with no
health insurance, and child support from her first husband, Amey's
family of five has $22,491 a year to live on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm cutting down on my medications,'' she says, adding that
she takes pills for her fibromyalgia, a muscle and
connective-tissue disorder, ``only when I can't stand the pain
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to make a choice between seeing the doctor and
eating. If I get sick, it's `OK, do I go to the doctor or pay the
bills? Eighty dollars to see the doctor _ to me, that's the
groceries.''
</P>
<P>
   Health care advocates fear there are many more people like Amey.
They say tens of thousands of ex-welfare recipients now in the work
force are poised to join the ranks of the 43.4 million Americans
who have no health insurance whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unintended consequence of welfare reform is that a large
number of low-income people (who go from welfare to work) are being
rewarded by losing their health care coverage,'' says Ron Pollack,
executive director of Families USA, an advocacy group that
concentrates on health issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of people moving into jobs wind up in
entry-level positions with low wages and few benefits,'' Pollack
adds. ``The majority of those receive no health insurance. So when
they lose Medicaid, they lose coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Families USA is conducting a survey of working former welfare
recipients who have lost Medicaid, and Pollack says the number will
be at least in the tens of thousands and maybe higher.
</P>
<P>
   Amey's situation is a measure of the rough headwinds that former
welfare recipients encounter when they leave the rolls. With
prodding from the states that were undertaking their own
experiments, Congress enacted a welfare overhaul in 1996. The law
limited recipients to two years of public assistance at any one
time and five years over a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and congressional Republicans have hailed the
sharp declines in the welfare rolls _ 7.9 million people are now on
welfare; in 1993 the number was 14.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   But health care advocates argue that the vulnerability of these
new workers and their families often is overlooked in the rush of
headlines celebrating the success of welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``The barriers that people with low wages face in trying to cope
with everyday living _ whether (paying for) childcare, health
insurance or basic transportation _ are just amazing,'' says Diana
Rowland, executive director of the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid
and the Uninsured, which tracks low-income people's access to
health care..MDRV/.MDNM/
</P>
<P>
   Health-plan coverage for the poor is ``where our system of
employer-based coverage is eroding, and public policy is not
filling the gap,'' Rowland says.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a
Washington-based advocacy group, 15.8 million working parents have
incomes at or below $27,300 a year, which is twice the
government-set poverty level for a family of three. Of those, more
than a third _ 5.4 million _ were uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the federal government is getting the word out that
time-limited Medicaid is, in fact, available to those leaving
welfare for work. Before the 1996 law, Medicaid coverage came
automatically with welfare. But the law separated the two programs,
leaving many recipients entering the job market with the belief
that Medicaid no longer was available.
</P>
<P>
   Many state and local welfare agencies did little to inform
recipients that they still qualified for Medicaid. So last month
the U.S. Health and Human Services Department sent a letter to
state and local administrators, encouraging them to disseminate and
process Medicaid applications without delay.
</P>
<P>
   A new federal initiative, the Children's Health Insurance
Program (CHIP), approved by Congress as part of the 1997 Balanced
Budget Act, offers states money to expand Medicaid for poor
children or to create a separate health program for them.
</P>
<P>
   And some states have found creative ways to extend Medicaid
coverage. Connecticut, Delaware, New Jersey and South Carolina have
received federal waivers to give welfare-to-work families an extra
year on Medicaid. Vermont has authority to offer an extra year
above that _ a total of three years _ for some families.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Eva Amey and thousands more like her continue to
fall through the cracks.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Yacknin, a lawyer with the Greater Upstate Law Project in
Rochester, N.Y. who has represented Amey, is lobbying the New York
legislature for a new program called Family Health Plus, which
would use the state's estimated $1-billion-a-year-for-25-years
share of tobacco-lawsuit settlement money to extend health
insurance to low-income, working adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are scrimping on food,'' Yacknin says. ``They're
in a worse position than when they were on welfare.''

CELLUCCI HAS MUCH TO PROVE ABOUT HIS LEADERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If death and taxes are the only certainties in life, the death
penalty and tax cuts are the only certainties so far in the
Cellucci administration.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the House of Representatives defeated the governor's
bid to reinstate capital punishment. Now what?
</P>
<P>
   This is a governor who is still trying to prove he has vision,
backbone, and clout. Unfortunately, he has been relying on the
wrong issues to argue his case.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci scored points with the capital punishment crowd and
took his licks from Cardinal Bernard Law. ``I didn't expect to be
called a sinner,'' he says with a slight smile, when asked about
Law's recent remarks about ``well-informed Catholics'' who support
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   He stands to be called worse if he doesn't switch soon from
campaign issues to governing issues.
</P>
<P>
   The endless debate over capital punishment and a skirmish with a
cardinal who is as PR-savvy as any politician have little do with
the everyday demands of real governance. Throwing down the gauntlet
on a large income tax reduction is not exactly an exercise in
political courage either.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci says he is ``putting my leadership and reputation on
the line'' by threatening to lead a petition drive for a ballot
question to cut the state income tax to 5 percent. But championing
a tax cut is another easy, voter-friendly cause.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci got off to a slow start after election day and never
really gathered positive momentum on Beacon Hill. He looked weak
against state legislative leaders and his own appointees, such as
the state board of education and the board of trustees of the
University of Massachusetts. Headlines blare sorrowful news about
children caught in so-called houses of horror that fall under the
purview of his Department of Social Services.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, he continued to talk death penalty and tax cuts.
He seems trapped by the mindset that prevailed during the two terms
he served as lieutenant governor under former Governor Weld. Then,
the bad guys were obvious: They included Governor Dukakis and the
Democratic leaders who let state spending spiral wildly out of
control. Whatever went wrong was blamed on them.
</P>
<P>
   Now, who is to blame for whatever is wrong? After nine years of
Weld and Cellucci, the simple answer is: Weld and Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   But governing shouldn't be about blame, and it is never about
simple answers. It should be about choices and making the ones that
collectively improve our lives. Sometimes it is about telling
people what they don't want to hear and following through on it.
That is leadership.
</P>
<P>
   It is not too late for Cellucci to show some.
</P>
<P>
   He will argue, of course that tax cuts improve people's lives.
But relatively speaking, what he is talking about doesn't change
much or improve much.
</P>
<P>
   In life and in government, saving money isn't an ultimate end in
itself _ is it?
</P>
<P>
   We save for our children's education. We save so we can build a
dormer or repave a driveway. We save for a vacation or a rainy day.
If you are a governor, you save to build schools, repair roads and
courthouses and to provide services for the youngest, the oldest
and the poorest.
</P>
<P>
   What Cellucci seems to miss is that people want and expect
government to spend money to fix what is not working. They don't
want government to waste their money or spend all of it. But they
do want their children to go to safe and modern schools. They want
to drive on roads and bridges that are not falling apart. They want
the youngest and the oldest citizens to be treated with dignity.
And some of us, although not all of us, feel an obligation to share
what we have collectively as a society with those who have much,
much less as individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Give the governor his due. He is making good on his campaign
rhetoric when it comes to the death penalty and tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   When does he make good on his pledge to be our leader?
</P>
<P>
   Asked about it, he points to his stand on the Logan runway as an
example. He says he won't back down from the controversial
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am listening to the neighborhoods and I understand their
concerns. I am listening to the mayor. We have to share the
air-traffic burden. But we need a fully functional Logan,'' the
governor says.
</P>
<P>
   If he folds now on the runway, Cellucci would be folding on the
business community and on the vast majority of Massachusetts
residents who don't have to weigh the need for a more efficient
Logan against the aggravation of having an airport as a next-door
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Folding would not be wise for a governor who still needs to
prove he has vision, backbone, and clout. Sticking with the runway
would be a start in showing some leadership. But there is still a
long way to go.

IGNORE THE CRITICS AND FINISH THE JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My fellow Americans: Get a grip.
</P>
<P>
   The headless chickens of the political and media establishment
are going bananas. We're running out of cruise missiles! The
weather is too cloudy over Serbia! We should have anticipated the
Serbs' Plan B was Kosovo-wide massacre! They're burning our flag on
TV!
</P>
<P>
   The nay-saying and second-guessing in the wake of NATO's bombing
campaign in the crumbling remains of what used to be Yugoslavia is
a panic reaction to a very grim and unpredictable set of
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the United States was ill prepared for war. No, it won't be
short and sweet and casualty-free. Yes, the Clinton administration
was weak on preparation for what we now face. No, the NATO exercise
that turned into a full-fledged war is not a neat little package.
</P>
<P>
   But let's take a deep breath here. Slobodan Milosevic's
Yugoslavia is an imploding mess of a country. Everything he tried
to seize by force _ Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, now Kosovo, maybe
Montenegro and Albania
</P>
<P>
   next _ has blown up in his kisser. Can the massed forces of 19
western democracies, spearheaded by the mightiest military
technology in history, defeat a poor, faction-ridden country the
size and population of Ohio? Can the 700-plus million people of the
NATO nations slap
</P>
<P>
   Slobodan silly? I think the odds are in our favor.
</P>
<P>
   We can save Kosovo without invading Serbia; we took back Kuwait
without occupying Iraq. It may yet take ground troops and tanks
shipped through Greece. But give NATO's warplanes three or four
clear nights, and Belgrade begins to look like Baghdad after a
rough week. What happens when that extra US Navy carrier group
arrives offshore? More pulverizing of what we can find of
Milosevic's forces will certainly commence.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those opposed to the NATO military action claim the
justification of ending Serb atrocities in Kosovo is insufficient
because we didn't intervene in Cambodia against Pol Pot or in
Rwanda to stop black-on-black genocide. That line of reasoning does
not persuade me. For reasons of geography and history, the NATO
move on Kosovo is prudent, even necessary. That has nothing to do
with the skin color of the victims; melanin content did not dictate
NATO's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's international aid minister, Clare Short, was
positively withering when she figuratively dismembered the Tories'
Shadow Secretary in Parliament after he tried to accuse the Labor
government of making a bollocks, as the Brits say, by screwing up
the war, the diplomacy, and the relief effort. Fragging your own
leaders when things seem to be going wrong is not limited to any
one nationality, it appears.
</P>
<P>
   But that's democracy in action, folks.
</P>
<P>
   Mercifully, the US Congress is in Easter recess for two weeks,
meaning we are all spared having to wade through their blather.
Coming off the impeachment debacle, the manufactured uproar over
Chinese spying, the thin gruel of sexual scandal and talk show
trivia, having our solons weigh in on serious business like life or
death would leave them overmatched.
</P>
<P>
   In their place we have the talking heads of TV, who toss out
their gloom-drenched predictions with unabashed fervor, despite
their dismal record in dissecting the politics of the last year.
From OJ to Jon-Benet, from gays in the military to horniness in the
White House, the TV claque natter on.
</P>
<P>
   Chowderheads and flannelmouths who could not pick out Kosovo on
a map assure us with practiced ease that things are going to hell
rapidly and no good can come of this. The 12-men-and-a-woman
running for president are grumpily evasive on the hard question of
being willing to put NATO ground troops at risk, with the
glittering exception of Senator John McCain of Arizona, the former
Navy combat pilot and POW.
</P>
<P>
   In plain and gutsy language, McCain says ``we have to win . . .
whatever it takes to win,'' and if that requires ground troops, so
be it. More bombing, says McCain; start ``turning the lights out in
Belgrade'' if need be. McCain knocks Clinton for being
``feckless,'' ``where our mission is confused and our exit strategy
is a complete mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   On that score, he is echoed by Bill Bradley, the only Democrat
opposing Vice President Gore, who's locked into whatever Clinton
does as commander-in-chief. Bradley, who raised an eye-opening $4
million in just three months, says ``serious questions'' are
unanswered about Clinton's policy.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Governor George W. Bush, who has time to raise $6 million
in campaign money, interview supplicants, and watch stock car
races, is tongue-tied. He lost standing by ducking the
what-would-you-do question. Steve Forbes, Lamar Alexander, and Dan
Quayle are scorching about Clinton, predictable in supporting air
strikes, and stoutly oppose sending ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, who trails only Bush in the polls, is for the
administration policy. She has to be; her husband is strongly for
it, and her fledgling candidacy could not survive a public rift
with Old Bob. Opposing America's involvement in the NATO war are
Pat Buchanan, whose oft-brandished talk-show bellicosity seems
confined to our trading partners; and US Representative John Kasich
of Ohio, who mocks Clinton. Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire,
Gary Bauer, and Alan Keyes all object to US policy as well. The

`SILENT EPIDEMIC' INCREASINGLY TARGETS THE YOUNG 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Parkinson's disease is a cruel magician. It makes its
victims slowly disappear.
</P>
<P>
   It mutes their voices, erases their expressions, robs them of
their motor control. Finally, they freeze in a kind of suspended
animation, disappearing behind the blank stare of the ``Parkinson's
mask.''
</P>
<P>
   Although more people have Parkinson's than multiple sclerosis,
Lou Gehrig's disease and muscular dystrophy combined, the disease
has escaped much public notice and research funding.
</P>
<P>
   It is a disease that renders its victims invisible, trapping
them inside their houses, inside their bodies, inside their minds,
until they simply vanish to the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parkinson's has been called the silent epidemic,'' said Dr.
Donald Calne, a neurologist at the University of British Columbia
in Vancouver. And it's a growing one.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers are optimistic. Breakthroughs are on the horizon
that they hope will not only help Parkinson's patients, but also
will advance the understanding of other degenerative brain
diseases. New drugs and new kinds of surgery that could
dramatically improve quality of life are becoming available.
</P>
<P>
   Once thought of exclusively as an ``old person's disease,''
Parkinson's is increasingly affecting younger people.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists aren't sure why. Possibly, greater awareness of
symptoms has led to earlier diagnosis. But it may be something more
sinister.
</P>
<P>
   Parkinson's is caused by a shortage of a chemical messenger in
the brain. Dopamine, a key neurotransmitter involved in motor
control, allows us to translate the will to move into action. What
causes brain cells to die and stop producing dopamine, however,
remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists suspect that the disease is caused by a complex
interaction between genes and the environment. Environmental toxins
play a role in triggering the disease, although no one knows which
toxins, or why they trigger the disease in some people and not
others.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe that until those answers are clear, the incidence
of Parkinson's is bound to increase.
</P>
<P>
   Calne, who has tracked Parkinson's patients for more than three
decades, has already seen a fourfold increase in younger patients.
</P>
<P>
   Although the average age of onset is about 57, 10 percent to 15
percent of patients show symptoms before 40.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 1 million people _ 1 percent to 2 percent of people
older than 60 _ have Parkinson's disease, a number that is expected
to swell as baby boomers age.
</P>
<P>
   And it could get much worse. Some experts call Parkinson's the
``iceberg disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Autopsy findings show that for every patient with overt symptoms
of Parkinson's, 10 or 20 more show traces of the brain damage
associated with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its prevalence, Parkinson's hasn't had the visibility of
illnesses such as AIDS or cancer, partly because patients haven't
mobilized to raise money or awareness.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to get Parkinson's patients to take action, said
Dennis Wright, 46, who was diagnosed four years ago. Parkinson's
patients can't turn their own thoughts into actions, let alone act
on the thoughts of others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not responding is pretty natural in this group,'' he said.
Wright has lobbied in Washington, D.C., as well as Olympia, Wash.,
to raise funds to fight the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still way behind on per-patient spending compared to
other diseases,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Parkinson's affects about as many patients as HIV and AIDS, for
example, but the National Institutes of Health last year spent $41
in research per Parkinson's patient, compared with $1,640 per
patient with HIV or AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Now more and more Parkinson's patients, especially younger ones,
are speaking out about the need for more funding in the hopes of
finding a cure. A Parkinson's cure also could yield new approaches
to treating other brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Lou
Gehrig's disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many possible cures coming from so many different
directions,'' Wright said. ``People always say a cure is 15 years
away, but my goal is to get that to five years, or three years
even.''
</P>
<P>
   OIL FOR THE TIN MAN:
</P>
<P>
   A cure has already come tantalizingly close.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Parkinson first described the mysterious ``shaking
palsy'' in 1817. Although references to Parkinson's symptoms date
to Chinese and Indian medical texts more than 2,500 years ago,
Parkinson was the first to recognize that many paradoxical symptoms
were related to the same disease.
</P>
<P>
   The symptoms included stiffness and tremors, rigid
immobilization and a sudden unlocking of activity. Patients might
sit for hours with an unblinking stare, or suddenly scoot off in a
frenzy of tiny, accelerating steps, a stuttering gait that gave
them a Chaplinesque quality. Apparently paralyzed, many patients
were nonetheless capable of surprising reflexive action, such as
running out of a house on fire, or jumping in a river to save a
drowning victim.
</P>
<P>
   It was as though some internal on-off toggle switch was
malfunctioning.
</P>
<P>
   It took 150 more years for scientists to figure out that the
toggle switch was dopamine, which is vital for relaying motor
signals in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dopamine is like oil for the tin man,'' said Bill Bell of
Seattle, whose mother, stepfather, godfather and another relative
all live with the disease. Dopamine is what keeps people moving
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   That discovery led to the first treatment for Parkinson's:
levodopa. L-dopa, made famous in Oliver Sacks' book ``Awakenings,''
is converted to dopamine by nerve cells in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   L-dopa miraculously roused Parkinson's patients _ even some who
had been frozen for decades _ but the ``cure'' was short-lived. As
Parkinson's progresses, there are fewer neurons to convert L-dopa
to dopamine, and the drug's efficacy wears off.
</P>
<P>
   Parkinson's symptoms occur when dopamine-producing neurons in
the substantia nigra of the brain begin to die. In the exotic
geography of the brain, the substantia nigra is a thumbnail-size
structure at the top of the brain stem in one of the most primitive
and evolutionarily ancient parts of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   The neurons of the substantia nigra communicate with the basal
ganglia _ a constellation of neuron-dense structures buried deep in
the cerebral hemispheres.
</P>
<P>
   The basal ganglia provide a critical feedback loop that governs
motor control, modulating information as it flows between the
cerebral cortex, where complex movements originate as thoughts, and
the spinal cord, where those thoughts are translated into action.
Dopamine makes this loop work, giving people control over their
voluntary movement.
</P>
<P>
   By the time symptoms appear in most patients, the brain has
already lost 80 percent of its ability to make dopamine.
</P>
<P>
   Without dopamine, the nerve cells can't tell which signals are
important to relay, said Richard Palmiter, a professor of
biochemistry at the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppose you're driving at night and you see hundreds of
lights, but you can't figure out that the red and green lights are
the important ones to pay attention to,'' he said. ``Somehow,
you've got to be able to focus on the right lights, or you'll make
the wrong decision when driving.''
</P>
<P>
   Dopamine helps direct the nerve cell traffic.
</P>
<P>
   THE SEARCH FOR CLUES:
</P>
<P>
   Although researchers don't know what causes neurons in the
substantia nigra to die, they suspect genetic susceptibility and
environmental toxins both play a role.
</P>
<P>
   A landmark study published recently in the Journal of the
American Medical Association, for example, showed that the
identical twins of Parkinson's patients are no more likely overall
to get the disease than non-identical siblings, indicating that
genes play a limited role. (There was evidence that genetics play a
stronger role in patients who show symptoms before age 50.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Parkinson's is thought to be caused by the combination of
aging, genetic predisposition and environmental factors,'' said Dr.
Ali Samii, a neurologist and movement disorder specialist at
Harborview Medical Center here.
</P>
<P>
   Except in rare cases, the disease doesn't run in families. But
about 15 percent of patients have a close relative with
Parkinson's, which points to a complicated interplay between
environment and genes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think something quite transient might set (the disease) in
motion,'' Calne said. ``That's the simplest explanation. Some
(environmental factor) kills some cells immediately and damages
others.''
</P>
<P>
   An environmental trigger could alter the programming of the
cells so they die over time, eventually depleting the dopamine
supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rough epidemiological studies have linked higher incidence of
Parkinson's in areas of high industry, or where there is lots of
chemical usage,'' said Dr. Phil Ballard, director of the Movement
Disorder Center at Swedish Medical Center. ``Some studies have
linked it to well water as well, but so far no one has been able to
identify any one specific thing.''
</P>
<P>
   TREATMENT HORIZONS:
</P>
<P>
   While scientists continue to search for the trigger, they also
are devising new ways to treat Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's exciting about Parkinson's is that the knowledge about
the mechanism underlying nerve cell degeneration and regeneration
is just exploding,'' Ballard said.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists believe that Parkinson's research will yield the
big breakthrough that will allow them to someday reverse many kinds
of degenerative brain diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Work already is under way on new classes of drugs, including
some that doctors hope will be neuroprotective _ preventing the
nerve cells from dying in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a rather exciting time,'' Calne said. ``In the course
of the last two years, five new drugs for Parkinson's have come on
the market, compared with about one every five years previously.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the new drugs mimic the action of dopamine, and two
block the breakdown of dopamine so that the brain's supply doesn't
dwindle as quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers are looking at ways to stimulate the brain to
make new neurons, something thought impossible a few years ago,
Ballard said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, new surgical techniques show promise for better
symptom control, especially for tremors.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sean Grady, a neurosurgeon at Harborview, and Dr. Diana
Kraemer at Swedish are doing ``deep brain stimulation,'' which
involves threading a delicate electrode into the thalamus, one of
the structures of the basal ganglia. The electrode is attached to a
pacemaker-like device implanted in the patient's chest. The patient
activates the device by passing a magnet over his skin. The device
then delivers a mild electrical current that essentially ``turns
off'' the tremor by blocking nerve cells that are misfiring in the
brain.
</P>
<P>
   The device can be ``tuned'' up or down, depending on the
tremors' severity, and generally creates fewer side effects than
traditional surgery for tremors. It also is reversible. Surgeons
can remove the electrode, leaving the brain tissue intact. In the
traditional approach, surgeons burn small lesions in the brain,
permanently destroying tissue, Grady said.
</P>
<P>
   As techniques improve, scientists also are experimenting with
threading the electrodes into an even smaller part of the brain _
the subthalamic region _ which they think could control even more
Parkinson's symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   There are even more futuristic therapies on the horizon.
Scientists now believe that fetal cells implanted in the brain can
replace the missing dopamine. For such implants to become
widespread, however, researchers must develop a cell line that can
be cultured in the lab and produced in large quantities.
</P>
<P>
   Even more enticing is the lure of gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The UW's Palmiter recently demonstrated a technique for
introducing new genes into the brain cells of mice, which could
lead to gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Palmiter used a modified virus to introduce a gene that caused
mice with Parkinson's-like symptoms to make more dopamine. Viruses,
which are nature's genetic engineers, can insert themselves into
the DNA of host cells.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is to find the right gene to put into human brain
cells, Palmiter said. Researchers are looking for a gene that would
protect the cells in the substantia nigra from being destroyed by
Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
   To find such a gene, however, scientists need to understand how
the cellular machinery breaks down in the first place. This is the
holy grail of brain research. Scientists now think there may be a
common mechanism that causes cell death in patients with
Alzheimer's, Lou Gehrig's disease, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy
and other neurodegenerative brain disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alzheimer's and Parkinson's _ they have common threads running
through them,'' Calne said. ``If patients live long enough with
Alzheimer's, they will develop some symptoms of Parkinson's and
vice versa.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers hope unlocking the secret to Parkinson's will help
unlock the secret to all the degenerative brain diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have pieces of information,'' Ballard said. ``It's like a
picture developing in a (darkroom) pan. The picture is just
starting to get to where you can tell what it is.''

SCIENTIST FIGHTS DISEASE AT WORK -- AND IN LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Paul Gladstone understands at a more intimate level
than most the anatomy of the damaged brain.
</P>
<P>
   As a scientist, he is on working terms with the intricate
molecular pathways in the brain. He can describe what happens when
neurons die and neurotransmitters disappear. He details which
circuits get disrupted, which loops of neural programming get
erased.
</P>
<P>
   As a patient, he lives with the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   On this particular day, Gladstone, 51, is hunched over his
kitchen table contemplating the links between the immune system and
the central nervous system, two areas of particular scientific
interest to him.
</P>
<P>
   He speaks rapidly in a soft, breathy voice, barely audible at
times. His words tumble over each other, the sentences speeding
away from him like eager dogs let out on a trail. He pauses
frequently, as if to call back his thoughts, before his words take
off again. It's a curious, involuntary acceleration of speech.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a symptom of Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   There are other signs as well. His body has a strangely restless
quality, as though he were responding to a cacophony of nervous
impulses. His foot rocks with a constant tremor. His hands shake.
When he crosses the room, his gait is unsteady, his balance
tenuous. He still has a yellowing bruise on one cheekbone from a
recent spill.
</P>
<P>
   It's a particularly cruel turn for Gladstone, whose second love
is the stage. A former actor with an improv group, it's as though
his body now improvises without him.
</P>
<P>
   Diagnosed at 38, Gladstone is one of the growing number of
younger people with Parkinson's, a disease that attacks the brain's
main motor signal pathways. Relentless and progressive, it
eventually disconnects the mind and body so patients lose the
ability to initiate or control movement.
</P>
<P>
   Effortless movement is, by definition, something most of us
don't think much about. When we walk, we don't have to will our
arms to swing in opposition to our steps. When we're amused, we
laugh without considering how to arrange our facial muscles to
convey our emotion.
</P>
<P>
   For Parkinson's patients, however, that autopilot function is
turned off. Controlling movement requires intense concentration and
exertion.
</P>
<P>
   Although no two people with Parkinson's exhibit symptoms exactly
the same way, the most recognizable signs are a tremor in the hands
and feet, rigidity and a stooped posture.
</P>
<P>
   The disease leads to a profound poverty of movement that robs
patients of gesture and expression. Their faces take on an
unblinking, masklike look; they take short, shuffling steps; their
arms don't swing. They may slow to the point of freezing. With no
balance reflexes, they frequently fall. About 30 percent of
patients eventually suffer some cognitive impairment, ranging from
memory lapse to dementia.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists know the disorder stems from a shortage of dopamine,
a chemical messenger necessary for the smooth transmission of motor
signals. And they know the shortage is caused by the death of the
main dopamine-producing neurons in the brain. They can even
pinpoint where in the brain the cells begin to die.
</P>
<P>
   But they don't know what causes the neurons to die.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment, vastly improved in recent years, means many patients
can live for years with relative control of their symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, there is no stopping it _ at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the second most common degenerative disorder after
Alzheimer's,'' said Dr. Sean Grady, a neurosurgeon at Harborview
Medical Center and professor at the University of Washington.
``Everyone knows someone with Parkinson's.''
</P>
<P>
   Gladstone first suspected something was wrong when one arm
didn't swing correctly when he went jogging. He had other subtle
symptoms as well _ a puzzling slowing of his movements, a
breathiness that stole into his voice.
</P>
<P>
   A research immunologist, Gladstone's scientific intuition told
him something wasn't working right.
</P>
<P>
   It would be two years before his diagnosis, however, because few
doctors thought to consider Parkinson's in someone so young.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors couldn't see my symptoms, but they believed me,''
he said. ``They just couldn't tell me what was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no blood test or laboratory test for Parkinson's. Only
an autopsy can lead to a definitive diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   Like detectives, pathologists dust for fingerprints of the
disease on the brain. In Parkinson's patients, slides of brain
tissue show distinctive granules of dark matter called Lewy bodies
strewn throughout the area damaged by the disease.
</P>
<P>
   These dark clumps appear to be related to the breakdown of the
neurons, said Dr. Donald Calne, a neurologist at the University of
British Columbia in Vancouver and a Parkinson's expert. They may be
made of cellular refuse, the miscellaneous building blocks in the
structure of the cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're like little bags of bones,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the living, there is no such telltale evidence. In the
absence of lab tests, doctors must deduce Parkinson's from its
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by a lack of answers, Gladstone finally went to the
Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., where a doctor recognized the
Parkinsonian quality of his voice and speech patterns.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost worse knowing. ``I have a very high tolerance for
ambiguity,'' he said. ``It's easier to deny something that doesn't
have a name.''
</P>
<P>
   For about six years after the diagnosis, Gladstone hid the
disease from colleagues, not wanting to lose his place in the
fast-paced, ultra-competitive world of medical research.
</P>
<P>
   Then a senior scientist with Bristol-Meyers Squibb Co., he was
studying the regulation of the immune system at the cellular level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid they would take me less seriously,'' said
Gladstone, who earned his doctorate in genetics from Harvard
University and worked for a time as a researcher at the University
of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As the disease progressed, however, it became more difficult to
hide _ and not just from colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Separated from his wife, he has an 8-year-old daughter,
Danielle, who spends two nights a week with him. Danielle learned
at an early age the nuances of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I've been alive, my Dad has had it,'' she said. It means
she must help him around the house and explain to friends why her
Dad seems different sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   When his medication starts wearing off, for example, Gladstone's
face begins to freeze. She tells friends: ``Poppy doesn't smile
when he gets stiff.''
</P>
<P>
   She is nonchalant about occasionally having to help her Dad up
when he falls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most kids don't have to worry about doing stuff like that at
such a young age,'' she said. ``It makes you so that you recognize
things when people need your help.''
</P>
<P>
   As his motor control became more erratic, Gladstone eventually
had to let go of his bench work in the lab. He stopped working
full-time about a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't do the fine-motor work anymore,'' he said. But his
mind is still a working laboratory. He reads constantly and
communicates with researchers all over the country, looking for new
ideas about the disease.
</P>
<P>
   He's also in demand as a consultant, brainstorming with
colleagues and ferreting out new directions for research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul was always an extraordinarily creative thinker,'' said
Jerry Nepom, director of Virginia Mason Research Center, during one
such session recently.
</P>
<P>
   Others try to think outside the box, he said. ``There is no box
for Paul.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, however, having Parkinson's has changed how
Gladstone approaches scientific questions.
</P>
<P>
   He knows the forces that drive ``big science.'' He knows how
easy it is to forget about the patients behind the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I got sick, I didn't think: This is about sick people,
people who need help,'' he said of his days in the lab. ``I have
very different criteria for judging research now. So much federally
funded research has so much to do with its own internal logic, and
so little to do with patients. I wish there were a patient on every
institute panel _ a group of people, patients, asking: `What will
this (study) do for the patient?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gladstone hopes that will happen someday. In the meantime, he
focuses on not letting Parkinson's take over his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having Parkinson's has meant losing so much of what
characterized me as a person _ my work, my energy, my acting, my
relationship with my daughter,'' he said. ``No area of my life is
unspared.''
</P>
<P>
   But he refuses to give in to the disease, and he continues to
search for answers.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledges that having a scientist for a patient has been a
challenge for his doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``She tells me to just back off and take my pills and be a
patient, but I can't,'' he said. ``That's not me. I'm always trying
to figure out another way.''

 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Dr. Phil Ballard had seen all sorts of bizarre
patients in psychiatric emergency rooms. But he'd never seen one
like George Carillo.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1982, and Ballard _ now head of the Movement Disorder
Center at Swedish Medical Center here _ was completing a neurology
fellowship at Stanford University. He'd been called in to consult
on a 42-year-old man who sat frozen mid-gesture, unblinking and
lifeless except for normal organ function. There was no evidence of
mental activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a blank stare and was stiff as a board,'' Ballard said.
Since the patient had come from jail, many doctors who saw him
suspected he was faking catatonic schizophrenia to get out of
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But it was no act.
</P>
<P>
   After seven days with no change and no diagnosis, Ballard
noticed a slight twitching in the man's fingers. He slipped him a
pad and pencil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what is happening to me,'' the patient wrote,
using just his fingertips. ``I can't move right. I know what I want
to do. It just won't come out right.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballard was elated to discover a normal mind trapped inside the
body. Slowly, he pieced together the patient's history. The patient
and his girlfriend were heroin addicts. They'd come down with
symptoms after injecting a street-synthesized version of Demerol, a
``designer drug'' meant to act like heroin.
</P>
<P>
   With that information in hand, Ballard and his boss, Dr. J.
William Langston, set out to solve the mystery of one patient and
ended up making a major breakthrough in the study of Parkinson's
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few weeks, more addicts in strangely frozen
postures began turning up in emergency rooms all over the San
Francisco Bay area. They had one thing in common. Each had been
using designer street narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators suspected a bad batch caused the outbreak, but
they couldn't identify the contaminant.
</P>
<P>
   Then, by chance, one of the team recalled reading an obscure
journal report years earlier of a young college student who had
ended up with identical symptoms after synthesizing his own drugs
in 1976. After he died 18 months later, an autopsy revealed the
distinctive brain damage associated with Parkinson's disease. Until
then, doctors had almost never seen Parkinson's in someone so
young. And they'd never seen it develop overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Ballard set out to find the article, which wasn't even in the
medical center library. ``I dug it out of the dusty reaches of the
racks of Stanford library,'' he said. ``I realized as I was reading
it that this is it, this has got to be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it turned out that a contaminant called MPTP caused both
the college student's symptoms and those of the street addicts.
</P>
<P>
   MPTP can slip across the blood-brain barrier, where it converts
into a chemical that kills the dopamine-producing cells in the
brain. A shortage of dopamine _ the main neurotransmitter involved
in coordinating movement _ leads to Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   In their quest for a new high, the addicts had inadvertently
given themselves an irreversible, debilitating disease.
</P>
<P>
   But they gave the scientific community something else: a clue to
what causes Parkinson's disease. MPTP resembles many environmental
chemicals, including pesticides, which led to the now widely
accepted theory that toxins induce Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to providing a key breakthrough in understanding the
disease, MPTP gave researchers a way to induce Parkinson's disease
in animals, giving them for the first time a model for testing new
drugs and other therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the original addicts received experimental
treatments, such as fetal cell implants, that grew out of that
research. In some cases, it dramatically improved their symptoms,
allowing them to resume a more normal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quite a chase,'' Ballard said. ``We had a lot of dead
ends and a lot of lucky breaks.''

SOFT LANDING `ON THE MOON' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WALTER ADDIEGO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``A Walk on the Moon,'' the counterculture and the Catskills
collide, with devastating results for a middle-class Jewish family
in the summer of 1969.
</P>
<P>
   These were interesting times (as in the old curse, ``May you
live in interesting times'') and the film never lets us forget it,
because otherwise we might mistake the story for a simple domestic
tragedy. No, this is a tale of major cultural transition.
</P>
<P>
   The changes eating away at the film's Kantrowitz family are old
standbys: hippies, Woodstock, the moon landing and similar
phenomena that are beloved of pop historians and lend themselves to
nice visuals.
</P>
<P>
   Director Tony Goldwyn and writer Pamela Gray place no heavy
demands on the audience; all is spelled out with excruciating
clarity. When mildly unhappy Pearl Kantrowitz (Diane Lane) meets
handsome, free-spirited Walker (Viggo Mortensen) while her
husband's away, you don't need tarot cards _ another of the film's
timely references _ to foresee the result.
</P>
<P>
   The Kantrowitzes are having their annual getaway at a funky
Catskills resort, a modest paradise of small bungalows, cornball
entertainers and occasional visits by traveling vendors, such as
the ``Ice Cream Man'' and the ``Blouse Man,'' who sells clothing to
the vacationing women.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying Pearl is her ready-to-break-loose 14-year-old
daughter, Alison (Anna Paquin), her 5-year-old son, Daniel, and her
prescient mother-in-law, Lilian (Tovah Feldshuh). Husband Marty
(Liev Schreiber), a TV repairman who had hoped for bigger things in
life, is on hand until called back to work in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The setting is played for affectionate laughs, as a
``MASH''-style announcer informs the vacationers that the ``Knish
Man'' is on the grounds; a woman friend of Pearl's wonders if she
should frost her hair; and some naked hippies briefly invade the
resort's lake, to the consternation of the strait-laced family
folk.
</P>
<P>
   As Alison takes a sudden interest in boys, Pearl _ who became
pregnant at 17 and has never slept with anyone but Marty _ starts
feeling a little itchy herself. She accepts a tie-dyed shirt from
long-haired, quietly sexy Walker (he's the blouse man) and they are
soon frolicking in their birthday suits in a nearby pond _
picture-perfect, of course. All is played out against a soundtrack
(Jefferson Airplane, Richie Havens, Jimi Hendrix) evocative of
paisleys and peace symbols.
</P>
<P>
   Well, nosy Lilian figures out the affair, and she's upset. When
Alison finds out, in a hokey scene actually set at the Woodstock
festival, she's even more upset _ moms aren't supposed to paint
their bodies and writhe with attractive strangers. And when Marty
finds out (tipped off by helpful Lilian), he's extremely upset,
hurls a milk carton against the cabin wall, etc. He's been
disappointed too, how could she do this? Pearl seems diminished by
her experiment with free love.
</P>
<P>
   OK, everyone's mad at her, she doesn't know what to do about
Walker's invitation to run off with him, and to top it all, her boy
is attacked and horribly stung by some highly symbolic wasps.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is not for me to reveal, except to say it strains
belief.
</P>
<P>
   Though short on subtlety, ``A Walk on the Moon'' does offer the
consolation of some decent performances (not surprising, as Dustin
Hoffman's company produced it). Lane (``Wild Bill'') is
surprisingly affecting in what could have been a pedestrian role _
why should we care about this essentially selfish person? The
talented Schreiber (the ``Scream'' horror fests) comes into his own
after Marty discovers his wife's betrayal. He's a decent guy whose
main consolation in life, his family, is suddenly shattered, and
the actor capitalizes nicely on the showcase offered by Marty's
grief and anger. Mortensen has little to do other than look
dangerously seductive; Feldshuh is an old pro, and Oscar-winner
Paquin is fine as the budding teen.
</P>
<P>
   Director Goldwyn (the grandson of MGM founder Sam Goldwyn)
clearly knows the milieu, but doesn't rise above the heavy-handed
material. He knows how to work with actors, but not with audiences,
who deserve a little more trust.

TWO CARETAKERS SHATTER ISOLATION AND SILENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Parkinson's disease can be paralyzing, not just in its
symptoms, but in its effects on family members as well.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bell of Seattle remembers his feelings of immobilization
and helplessness when he learned that his mother had Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The frightening aspect of finding out a loved one has
Parkinson's is that then you're on your own,'' he said. There's no
one-stop resource center to tell the patient and family what to
expect, or how to cope.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, 38, has struggled alone to find answers for his mother
over the past 12 years. And he's watched as the disease has touched
more family and friends. Since his mother's diagnosis, his
stepfather, his godfather and his uncle's brother have all been
diagnosed with Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
   Then he ran into Craig Howard, a former business colleague.
Howard, 37, had a similar tale. His stepmother has had Parkinson's
for 15 years. He, too, had found coping with Parkinson's an
isolating, frustrating experience.
</P>
<P>
   Together, Bell and Howard founded the Northwest Parkinson's
Foundation to help make it easier for patients and families to get
better answers about the disease. The foundation's goal is to
establish a comprehensive Parkinson's institute in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The year-old foundation is now a full-time commitment for both.
They are on the verge of signing a partnership agreement with a
local hospital to provide space and support for the institute,
which they expect to open by mid-summer. The center, which will
have a budget of about $1 million a year from private donations and
insurance coverage, will provide full-spectrum care for patients
and support services for families. The foundation will pick up some
of the services not covered by patients' insurance. The foundation
also plans to promote research.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been a focused center for care and knowledge of
Parkinson's in the Northwest,'' Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   The new center is modeled on the Struthers Center in Minnesota,
and will provide a holistic approach to managing Parkinson's. In
addition to medical treatment, it will provide exercise programs,
nutritional counseling and music and art therapy, as well as
occupational, speech and physical therapy. It also will provide
classes, support groups and respite care for caregivers.
</P>
<P>
   Managing Parkinson's disease is as much an art as a science,
Bell said. Patients often can improve the quality of their lives
substantially by changing or adjusting their medications.
</P>
<P>
   But such fine-tuning takes a tremendous amount of communication
among patients, caregivers and doctors, especially as new
treatments become available at an increasing rate.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of information-sharing is a primary goal of the
Parkinson's Foundation, Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Parkinson's tends to isolate patients, Bell said. ``A lot of
people retire to their chairs,'' he said. ``They have no outlet for
their frustration. People excuse themselves from public lives.
Depression is common.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's other goal is to raise public awareness.
</P>
<P>
   Parkinson's is a forgotten disease, Bell said. ``We've never had
a Jerry Lewis.''

GULF POW ADVISES FAMILIES TO `KEEP THE FAITH'' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CARMINA DANINI  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Melissa Coleman, the first American woman taken
prisoner during the Persian Gulf War, doesn't pay much attention to
the news. So when her mother told her Wednesday night about the
three U.S. servicemen who had been captured by Yugoslav forces,
Coleman said, ``Oh, goodness, here we go again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard about these three men, I was saddened to see
someone going through it again,'' said Coleman, who now lives in
San Antonio with her husband, a government employee, and their two
children. Known then as Melissa Rathbun-Nealy, the native of Grand
Rapids, Mich., was 21 when she went to the Persian Gulf with the
233rd Transportation Company stationed at Fort Bliss near El Paso,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   She and another soldier were on a supply mission near the
Kuwait- Saudi Arabia border Jan. 30, 1991, when Iraqi fire hit
their truck. Both were taken prisoner. The first servicewoman to be
a prisoner of war since World War II, she was held captive in Iraq
for 33 days. Coleman, who was wounded, later received the Purple
Heart, the Prisoner of War Medal and the National Defense Service
Medal.
</P>
<P>
   Another woman was taken prisoner by the Iraqis, Army flight
surgeon Rhonda Cornum. Cornum's husband, Kory, an Air Force flight
surgeon, said Thursday night that she is now stationed in Augusta,
Ga., and is in Australia this week and could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said she would tell the families of the three captured
U.S. soldiers in Yugoslavia _ Army Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone,
of Capac, Mich., Spc. Steve Gonzalez of Huntsville, Texas, and
Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez of Los Angeles _ to remain strong.
``Keep the faith, whatever their faith is,'' Coleman said. ``Stay
strong, think positive thoughts and don't believe everything they
hear.''
</P>
<P>
   The three soldiers captured this week were on patrol near the
border Yugoslav border as part of an international peacekeeping
force in the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. Yugoslavia
began court proceedings against three captured soldiers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, 29, recalled that her father, Leo Rathbun, had been
angered by initial reports that she was absent without leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't until I had been released and someone who saw it on
TV called my dad that he calmed down,'' Coleman said. ``My dad
called Washington and asked if they were now going to declare me a
prisoner of war.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said her family was shaken by rumors that surfaced while
she was a POW that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was going to use her
as a human shield, and that she had been mutilated and decapitated.
``My dad's typical Irish, so he wasn't happy with the (U.S.)
government,'' she said, ``and I was highly upset when he told me
after I came back.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, who was awakened shortly after 6 a.m. Thursday by a
call from the MSNBC cable news network and spent the rest of the
day on the telephone giving interviews, had another piece of advice
for the families of the three men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dealing with the media gets better with time,'' she said.
``Eventually, they go away.''

Today, at Mexico City's Botanical Garden botanists are reviving an
appreciation for this country's vast native plant life and its
nutritional and medicinal value. In addition to a huge collection
of agaves and cacti, the garden grows plants loaded with vitamins
or known to ease childbirth, stomach ailments and other troubles.
Workers at the garden often help themselves to leaves of one plant
to brew a tea that fights anemia. The garden is run by Mexico's

in international projects to develop medicines to treat AIDS,
tuberculosis and other diseases -- research that combines high-tech

VA TO STUDY ALLEGED BIAS AGAINST ASIAN-AMERICANS IN VIETNAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE CHAO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The psychological wounds suffered by Vietnam War
veterans are well documented. But the traumas of Asian-American
soldiers _ fighting in an unpopular war against an enemy who looked
like them _ are just now emerging.
</P>
<P>
   They had to protect themselves not only from Viet Cong
guerrillas but also from racist abuse, both verbal and physical,
within their own ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We discovered Asian-Americans had unique problems _
discrimination, getting beat up, getting called names, getting shot
at,'' said Lily Lee Adams, a Veterans Administration nurse who has
counseled numerous Asian-American veterans.
</P>
<P>
   To fully understand the race factors in the Vietnam War, the VA
is conducting its first race-related study, interviewing
Asian-American veterans in Hawaii, Guam and Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   The VA will spend $276,000 for the three-year study. It has
found 250 veterans and hopes to have a total of 300 by next month.
Results are expected this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Although not all the veterans experienced discrimination _
officers and those of higher rank usually had no complaints _ the
effect on those who did was often overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some of them, their identity's crushed,'' Adams said.
``They've been American all their life, then they go into the
military and are told they're not American. Their whole view about
themselves is shattered.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams, who is Chinese-American, was an Army nurse in Vietnam.
She said she often was mistaken for a Vietnamese prostitute by
other Americans in the compound.
</P>
<P>
   When David Oshiro, who is Okinawan-American and grew up in
Hawaii, lay wounded and bleeding in Vietnam, his fellow Americans
were reluctant to put him on the helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to whip out my dog tag and say, `I'm an American,''' he
said. ``They'll get all the black and white guys before they get
the Asians out.''
</P>
<P>
   Oshiro, now 50 and a resident of San Rafael, Calif., served in
the elite Special Forces and said he had a good relationship with
all the soldiers in his unit, but that soldiers from other units
were not as enlightened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been called `gook' more times than I care to think
about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While he was at basic training, a sergeant asked him and several
other Asian-Americans to dress up in black pajamas, the get-up of
the Viet Cong, to show recruits what the enemy looks like. Oshiro
refused.

FEDS QUESTION MICHIGAN MAN ABOUT TEXAS KILLINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MacCORMACK  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Federal agents investigating the disappearance of
atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair have had extensive talks with Gary P.
Karr, a Michigan ex-convict charged last week with a federal
weapons violation, his lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At his detention hearing, the FBI agent testified that they
interviewed Mr. Karr at his home for about 10 hours and the next
day for a few hours,'' Richard Helfrick, a federal public defender
who represents Karr, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their characterization of those interviews was that Mr. Karr
was cooperative with regards to matters relating to Texas involving
homicides,'' he said by telephone from Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Helfrick, however, declined to say if Karr has admitted any role
in any slayings. He said Karr has not made any deals to cooperate,
nor have federal prosecutors extended any offers.
</P>
<P>
   Karr, 50, and David R. Waters, 52, were arrested last week after
teams of federal agents and Dallas County deputies searched Karr's
apartment in Novi, Mich., and Waters' apartment in Austin, Texas.
Agents allegedly found two loaded pistols in Karr's apartment in
the Detroit suburb and 119 rounds of ammunition in Waters'
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Both are ex-convicts and were charged with being felons in
possession of firearms or ammunition. Following the raids, Waters'
lawyer, Patrick Ganne of Austin, quoted a federal prosecutor as
saying others were already giving damning evidence against his
client.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said a bunch of people are rolling over on him (Waters) and
implicating him in the murder of the O'Hair family,'' Ganne said of
Assistant U.S. Attorney Gerald Carruth of Austin. Carruth has
declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Karr and Waters are being held without bond. The March 24 raids
occurred as federal agents in Chicago and Fort Worth, Texas,
questioned other individuals about the O'Hair case and about the
coincidental disappearance of a Florida man named Danny Fry.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair, her son Jon Garth Murray, and her daughter Robin Murray
O'Hair vanished from San Antonio along with $500,000 in gold on
Sept. 29, 1995. O'Hair had risen to prominence more than three
decades ago in the wake of federal court battles to remove prayer
and Bible reading from public schools. In recent years, she ran a
cluster of atheist organizations in Austin with her two adult
children.
</P>
<P>
   Fry went to Austin in 1995, and like the O'Hair family, spent
September in San Antonio. On Oct. 2, 1995, three days after the
O'Hair family vanished, his headless, handless body was dumped on a
riverbank near Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Abundant circumstantial evidence, including telephone and
financial records, suggests the two cases are related, and that
Waters was a common link. Waters was O'Hair's former office manager
in 1994 and in 1995 pleaded guilty to stealing $54,000 from them.
He knew Fry in Florida years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Family members say Waters induced Fry to move to Texas for a
lucrative deal in mid 1995. Waters has denied knowing anything
about the O'Hair disappearance or Fry's death.
</P>
<P>
   Waters also has apparent links to Karr, having served eight
months in the same Illinois prison during the mid 1980s. He also
apparently contacted Karr after his release from prison in May
1995, Helfrick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he (Karr) got out of prison, I think he was trying to put
his past behind him, and go forward, and that if anything, Waters
injected himself into Karr's life,'' Helfrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Karr and Waters have extensive records that include violent
crime. Last week Karr was charged in Austin with another federal
crime, receiving stolen property in excess of $5,000. The complaint
states only that the crime occurred in October 1995 and involved
interstate transport ``from Texas to Florida and elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit explaining the stolen property charge is sealed
and federal officials have declined to comment on it. Karr's lawyer
said no attempts had been made yet to extradite him to Texas from
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still sitting here in the Wayne County Jail. I don't see
anything happening here for the foreseeable future,'' Helfrick
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Is the world's first war ``to stop genocidal violence'' merely
promoting it? It has certainly looked that way this week.
</P>
<P>
   After only four days of NATO's air attacks, the number of
Kosovars driven from their homes had risen to half a million, over
a quarter of the population; hundreds, perhaps thousands, had been
killed.
</P>
<P>
   These were the people NATO had intervened to save. The war
seemed to have gone horribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The final judgment on NATO's action may turn out to be quite
different, but only if events take a turn for the better, and do so
pretty soon.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO was working its way through the early items on its
order of business _ attacking air defenses, military bases,
communications centers and so on _ the Serb forces in Kosovo were
rounding up ethnic Albanians, driving families from their homes,
removing identity cards from fleeing refugees, and segregating men
and women.
</P>
<P>
   These are the familiar actions of ethnic-cleansers and, even
more sinisterly, of those about to embark on systematic slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that has taken place, and if so on what scale, is still
unknown, but the signs are ominous. Five of the Kosovars' leaders
are said to have been summarily executed, and tales of killing
abound.
</P>
<P>
   And though by midweek NATO was hoping that its air attacks were
at last frustrating the Kosovars' Serb tormentors, no one was
suggesting that the torment had ceased.
</P>
<P>
   If it goes on much longer, Kosovo threatens to become a
depopulated charnel house.
</P>
<P>
   The best hope of preventing that lies with a change of attitude
on the part of Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president. An
opportunity presented itself on Tuesday with the arrival in his
capital, Belgrade, of a party of Russian peacemakers led by Yevgeny
Primakov, the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a feather in the Russians' cap if they could
persuade Milosevic to come to terms, and the West would be happy to
let them take the credit. But Russia, though it is a long-standing
friend of the Serbs, failed to get them to make enough concessions
to avert this crisis, and it seems to have been no more successful
this time.
</P>
<P>
   Like many another despot, Milosevic probably prefers to preside
over a heap of rubble than not to preside at all. And so far
defiance appears to have brought him only popularity among his own
people. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (150-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 400) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bombing, it is true, tends to strengthen the resolve of those
who are bombed before it starts to sap their morale, and perhaps
the Serb populace may yet turn against their president.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, too, he may in time decide that his country has put up
a plucky enough resistance to the brutal NATO onslaught, and will
gracefully give up the troublesome _ probably now indeed
ungovernable _ province of Kosovo, just as he has given up so many
other parts of the original Yugoslavia he once aspired to rule.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, after all, has built his career by teaching the Serbs
that they should revel in martyrdom and defeat: the trouncing he
dwells on most was that delivered by the Ottomans in Kosovo 610
years ago, paving the way for their five centuries of subjugation
by Muslims. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So good riddance now to the Muslim Kosovars? Or rather to those
of them who might still be alive. If that thought is not to haunt
NATO's strategists, they must move faster than their plan for a
measured, weeks-long campaign once allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Their aim must be to take control of Kosovo, or most of it, as
quickly as possible and then to run it as a protectorate, in
effect, until its Albanians are safe from slaughter by the Serbs
and its far fewer Serbs are safe from retribution by the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees will then be able to return home, relieving neighboring
countries of a burden that increasingly threatens their stability.
</P>
<P>
   All this will be even harder to achieve from the air alone than
the original plan.
</P>
<P>
   If the Kosovars' guerrillas were an effective force, they might
do the necessary fighting on the ground, much as Croat soldiers did
during NATO's bombardment of the Bosnian Serbs in 1995. But the
Kosovars have yet to show they are a potent soldiery and, if they
should get the upper hand, NATO might find it hard to stop them
butchering the Serb minority _ and then declaring independence.
</P>
<P>
   The West insists it does not want that. It does not want to
break up Yugoslavia, it says. It just wants an end to genocidal
violence. That means it wants neither side to win: not an easy
objective to achieve, especially when the use of ground troops has
been ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   If words have to be swallowed in order to get NATO out of its
fix, these look like the ones to dispense with.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, NATO has only 12,000 troops in next-door
Macedonia, and the Serbs have 40,000 in Kosovo, or did before the
bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   NATO would need about 150,000 men to be assured of a decisive
victory. And even then it would not be a bloodless one: there would
be plenty of casualties.
</P>
<P>
   There would also, no doubt, be plenty of voices warning of
mission creep and Vietnam-like quagmires. Several NATO countries
might back out; in varying measures, Greece, Italy and the Czech
Republic are already dubious.
</P>
<P>
   The main objection, however, lies not in the prospect of
casualties but in the fact that it would take time to ready this
force _ time in which Milosevic could continue his butchery.
</P>
<P>
   Still, NATO may now have to accept that, without soldiers on the
ground, it may not be able to get the Serbs out of Kosovo at all.
For that reason, it should be preparing to send troops in.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the West was not wrong in principle to intervene:
whatever the legal position, it was right to say, after every
effort had been made to reach a negotiated settlement, that it
could not tolerate the continued brutalities in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The killings and ethnic cleansing of the past week are not the
work of the West; they are the work of Serbs, and they would surely
have taken place, albeit at a more leisurely pace, had NATO not
intervened, just as they were taking place before.
</P>
<P>
   The West's error was to will the end but not the means. Now it
must find the means.
</P>
<P>
   Failure will not just ensure a continuation of the brutality in
Kosovo; it will ensure that despots everywhere take heart. NATO is
not serious, they will say. It has no stomach for the fight.
</P>
<P>
   When the fate of innocent Kosovars is in the balance that is bad
enough. When western national interests are at stake, it will be
grave indeed. &QL;

<P>
   Whether that has taken place, and if so on what scale, is still
unknown, but the signs are ominous. Five of the Kosovars' leaders
are said to have been summarily executed, and tales of killing
abound.
</P>
<P>
   And though by midweek NATO was hoping that its air attacks were
at last frustrating the Kosovars' Serb tormentors, no one was
suggesting that the torment had ceased.
</P>
<P>
   If it goes on much longer, Kosovo threatens to become a
depopulated charnel house.
</P>
<P>
   The best hope of preventing that lies with a change of attitude
on the part of Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president. An
opportunity presented itself on Tuesday with the arrival in his
capital, Belgrade, of a party of Russian peacemakers led by Yevgeny
Primakov, the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a feather in the Russians' cap if they could
persuade Milosevic to come to terms, and the West would be happy to
let them take the credit. But Russia, though it is a long-standing
friend of the Serbs, failed to get them to make enough concessions
to avert this crisis, and it seems to have been no more successful
this time.
</P>
<P>
   Like many another despot, Milosevic probably prefers to preside
over a heap of rubble than not to preside at all. And so far
defiance appears to have brought him only popularity among his own
people. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (150-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 400) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bombing, it is true, tends to strengthen the resolve of those
who are bombed before it starts to sap their morale, and perhaps
the Serb populace may yet turn against their president.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, too, he may in time decide that his country has put up
a plucky enough resistance to the brutal NATO onslaught, and will
gracefully give up the troublesome _ probably now indeed
ungovernable _ province of Kosovo, just as he has given up so many
other parts of the original Yugoslavia he once aspired to rule.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, after all, has built his career by teaching the Serbs
that they should revel in martyrdom and defeat: the trouncing he
dwells on most was that delivered by the Ottomans in Kosovo 610
years ago, paving the way for their five centuries of subjugation
by Muslims. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So good riddance now to the Muslim Kosovars? Or rather to those
of them who might still be alive. If that thought is not to haunt
NATO's strategists, they must move faster than their plan for a
measured, weeks-long campaign once allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Their aim must be to take control of Kosovo, or most of it, as
quickly as possible and then to run it as a protectorate, in
effect, until its Albanians are safe from slaughter by the Serbs
and its far fewer Serbs are safe from retribution by the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees will then be able to return home, relieving neighboring
countries of a burden that increasingly threatens their stability.
</P>
<P>
   All this will be even harder to achieve from the air alone than
the original plan.
</P>
<P>
   If the Kosovars' guerrillas were an effective force, they might
do the necessary fighting on the ground, much as Croat soldiers did
during NATO's bombardment of the Bosnian Serbs in 1995. But the
Kosovars have yet to show they are a potent soldiery and, if they
should get the upper hand, NATO might find it hard to stop them
butchering the Serb minority _ and then declaring independence.
</P>
<P>
   The West insists it does not want that. It does not want to
break up Yugoslavia, it says. It just wants an end to genocidal
violence. That means it wants neither side to win: not an easy
objective to achieve, especially when the use of ground troops has
been ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   If words have to be swallowed in order to get NATO out of its
fix, these look like the ones to dispense with.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, NATO has only 12,000 troops in next-door
Macedonia, and the Serbs have 40,000 in Kosovo, or did before the
bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   NATO would need about 150,000 men to be assured of a decisive
victory. And even then it would not be a bloodless one: there would
be plenty of casualties.
</P>
<P>
   There would also, no doubt, be plenty of voices warning of
mission creep and Vietnam-like quagmires. Several NATO countries
might back out; in varying measures, Greece, Italy and the Czech
Republic are already dubious.
</P>
<P>
   The main objection, however, lies not in the prospect of
casualties but in the fact that it would take time to ready this
force _ time in which Milosevic could continue his butchery.
</P>
<P>
   Still, NATO may now have to accept that, without soldiers on the
ground, it may not be able to get the Serbs out of Kosovo at all.
For that reason, it should be preparing to send troops in.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the West was not wrong in principle to intervene:
whatever the legal position, it was right to say, after every
effort had been made to reach a negotiated settlement, that it
could not tolerate the continued brutalities in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The killings and ethnic cleansing of the past week are not the
work of the West; they are the work of Serbs, and they would surely
have taken place, albeit at a more leisurely pace, had NATO not
intervened, just as they were taking place before.
</P>
<P>
   The West's error was to will the end but not the means. Now it
must find the means.
</P>
<P>
   Failure will not just ensure a continuation of the brutality in
Kosovo; it will ensure that despots everywhere take heart. NATO is
not serious, they will say. It has no stomach for the fight.
</P>
<P>
   When the fate of innocent Kosovars is in the balance that is bad
enough. When western national interests are at stake, it will be
grave indeed. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The rest of the world does not usually take its lead from
America in social policy, but over the past few years droves of
delegations have turned up in New York City to find out how The Big
Apple has managed to bring down the murder rate from 2,200 in 1992
to 600 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zero-tolerance policing'' was the answer they carried back and
spread around the world until it became the conventional wisdom
espoused by conservative and liberal politicians alike.
</P>
<P>
   At his party conference last year, Britain's prime minister,
Tony Blair, pledged to adopt it; Australia's John Howard is also a
believer.
</P>
<P>
   But now, after a horrible murder, New Yorkers are wondering
whether it is really the best way to keep the streets safe.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago New York City police burst into the foyer of an
apartment building in pursuit of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African,
shot 41 bullets at him and hit him 19 times.
</P>
<P>
   The Reverend Al Sharpton started a protest movement against the
killing, which has now taken on a respectable, middle-class life of
its own. For the past two weeks, hundreds have been courting arrest
every day outside the headquarters of the New York Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody who is anybody in the black community or the
civil-liberties movement is there. Those arrested include David
Dinkins, the former mayor of New York, Kweisi Mfume, president of
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
(NAACP), Carl McCall, the state comptroller and New York's highest
elected black official, and, from the inevitable Hollywood
contingent, Susan Sarandon.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just the killing that people object to. Diallo's death
is seen as the inevitable result of the new policing methods, which
have led to the increasing harassment of young black men. The
connection may be indirect. But politically it is powerful.
</P>
<P>
   The theory of zero-tolerance policing came from an academic,
James Q. Wilson, who holds that allowing small crimes to pass
unpunished will encourage contempt for the law in larger matters: a
city in which people urinate in the streets will also be one in
which people rob each other.
</P>
<P>
   The police, he maintains, have lost control of the streets in
many cities. They need to reclaim it. New York City's mayor,
Rudolph Giuliani, and the former police commissioner, William
Bratton, leapt on these ideas.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, zero-tolerance policing in New York has mostly been
the job of the Street Crimes Unit. Under Bratton, it tripled in
size.
</P>
<P>
   Its officers began to search people, pretty much at random and
often with little cause, on the streets, in housing projects and in
apartment blocks.
</P>
<P>
   The ratio of arrests to searches is some measure of this: over
the past two years, the Street Crime Unit's records show that its
officers searched 45,000 people and arrested 9,500. But according
to the state attorney-general, Eliot Spitzer, police underreport
their searches, and the real number is probably five or ten times
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Young black men, in other words, are constantly frisked. This
practice was once familiar in Britain, where enthusiastic use of
the ``sus'' law led directly to the Brixton riots in London in
1981.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, though, a little habitual harassment is a small price to
pay for so many saved lives? Maybe, maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, there is much argument about the extent to which
these amazing figures can be attributed to zero-tolerance policing.
Evidence from other cities does not always support its proponents.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, for instance, has seen similar falls in its murder rate,
yet it rejected zero-tolerance policing in favor of close
coordination between the police, probation officers and black
leaders, and an effort to get guns off the streets.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the price paid has not been evenly shared. Blacks
have paid it, whites have not. New York's blacks are angry now, and
America does not need to stoke its racial fires.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has apparently seen the danger. He has belatedly met a
group of the protest leaders to discuss their demands. He has also
announced that the number of black and Latino officers in the
Street Crime Unit will be increased.
</P>
<P>
   As practiced in New York, zero-tolerance policing has gone too
far. New Yorkers fear that abandoning it will mean a return to the
old days.
</P>
<P>
   They should remember, though, that there are other ways of
keeping down the murder rate that are less costly in terms of race
relations and the good name of the police.
</P>
<P>
   At the far end of that spectrum stands gun control. After all,
countries where gun ownership is tightly controlled do not tend to
have American murder levels.
</P>
<P>
   The number of murders in the whole of Britain _ 780 in 1997 _ is
only slightly higher than in newly peaceful New York City. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Why can't a woman be more like a man?'' mused Henry Higgins in
``My Fair Lady.'' His wish is coming true.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past couple of decades, women have gained much ground
in the battle between the sexes.
</P>
<P>
   In principle, many have the right to equal pay; at school, girls
are now getting better grades than boys; and in most rich economies
women are taking the lion's share of the new jobs, while
traditional jobs for the boys in heavy industries disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Finance used to be a man's world, about which women were told
not to worry their pretty little heads. But according to a study by
two American economists, women are better investors than men,
earning a higher average return on their money.
</P>
<P>
   Even male sports are no longer safe, with ladies' football teams
and female boxers. And experts predict that women could soon
outperform men in long-distance swimming and the marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Where will it end?
</P>
<P>
   With a further indignity, that's where (though for whom is less
clear).
</P>
<P>
   One area where men have always had a huge advantage over women
is in the call of nature: women, unlike men, have to endure long
queues outside the ``ladies' room.''
</P>
<P>
   But equality is emerging here, too. Thanks to a Dutch invention,
a women's urinal is now on sale. The so-called ``Lady P'' is
designed to speed the flow and cut those queues.
</P>
<P>
   Men will surely not take this sitting down. Understandably, the
poor things feel threatened.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Britain's Equal Opportunities Commission has
received more complaints from men than women. And as male
executives supposedly feel downtrodden by female rivals, several
British firms are setting up male-only self-help groups to give men
the confidence to assert themselves in the office.
</P>
<P>
   Another study published this week suggests that the more a woman
earns relative to her partner, the greater the risk of a family
breaking up, whereas higher male earnings increase the chances of
its survival.
</P>
<P>
   If so, an economist might conclude that equality for women has
gone too far, creating ``negative externalities.'' But then most
economists are men.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, things haven't proceeded quite as far as these
anecdotes suggest: women still earn less than men in comparable
work and have a small share of top jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In America, only two of the chief executives of Fortune 500
companies are women, and only 11 percent of company directors.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, men (your female commentary writer feels obliged
to point out) do seem worried. It is a puzzle. But men are
essentially irrational.
</P>
<P>
   The rational answer would surely be for men to seek new, equal
rights themselves. For example, in many countries conscription
applies only to men, and maternity leave mainly to women. Many
women have to make the agonizing choice between work and children:
men would love to face such a dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   Men are also discriminated against in pension schemes: they face
the same contribution rates as women even though they die earlier.
And the next time someone shouts ``women and children first,'' ask
why.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of solutions. Women take time off with the
excuse of ``women's problems'' so men must be allowed to recover
from hangovers and other ``men's problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Nightclubs often have free ladies' nights, so men should have
free lads' nights. And once inside they should demand that women
buy their fair share of drinks.
</P>
<P>
   But most important of all, men should immediately claim equal
rights to do the cleaning, the ironing, the cooking and the diaper
changing. It's simply not fair that women monopolize all those
jobs. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Why can't a woman be more like a man?'' mused Henry Higgins in
``My Fair Lady.'' His wish is coming true.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past couple of decades, women have gained much ground
in the battle between the sexes.
</P>
<P>
   In principle, many have the right to equal pay; at school, girls
are now getting better grades than boys; and in most rich economies
women are taking the lion's share of the new jobs, while
traditional jobs for the boys in heavy industries disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Finance used to be a man's world, about which women were told
not to worry their pretty little heads. But according to a study by
two American economists, women are better investors than men,
earning a higher average return on their money.
</P>
<P>
   Even male sports are no longer safe, with ladies' football teams
and female boxers. And experts predict that women could soon
outperform men in long-distance swimming and the marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Where will it end?
</P>
<P>
   With a further indignity, that's where (though for whom is less
clear).
</P>
<P>
   One area where men have always had a huge advantage over women
is in the call of nature: women, unlike men, have to endure long
queues outside the ``ladies' room.''
</P>
<P>
   But equality is emerging here, too. Thanks to a Dutch invention,
a women's urinal is now on sale. The so-called ``Lady P'' is
designed to speed the flow and cut those queues.
</P>
<P>
   Men will surely not take this sitting down. Understandably, the
poor things feel threatened.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Britain's Equal Opportunities Commission has
received more complaints from men than women. And as male
executives supposedly feel downtrodden by female rivals, several
British firms are setting up male-only self-help groups to give men
the confidence to assert themselves in the office.
</P>
<P>
   Another study published this week suggests that the more a woman
earns relative to her partner, the greater the risk of a family
breaking up, whereas higher male earnings increase the chances of
its survival.
</P>
<P>
   If so, an economist might conclude that equality for women has
gone too far, creating ``negative externalities.'' But then most
economists are men.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, things haven't proceeded quite as far as these
anecdotes suggest: women still earn less than men in comparable
work and have a small share of top jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In America, only two of the chief executives of Fortune 500
companies are women, and only 11 percent of company directors.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, men (your female commentary writer feels obliged
to point out) do seem worried. It is a puzzle. But men are
essentially irrational.
</P>
<P>
   The rational answer would surely be for men to seek new, equal
rights themselves. For example, in many countries conscription
applies only to men, and maternity leave mainly to women. Many
women have to make the agonizing choice between work and children:
men would love to face such a dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   Men are also discriminated against in pension schemes: they face
the same contribution rates as women even though they die earlier.
And the next time someone shouts ``women and children first,'' ask
why.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of solutions. Women take time off with the
excuse of ``women's problems'' so men must be allowed to recover
from hangovers and other ``men's problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Nightclubs often have free ladies' nights, so men should have
free lads' nights. And once inside they should demand that women
buy their fair share of drinks.
</P>
<P>
   But most important of all, men should immediately claim equal
rights to do the cleaning, the ironing, the cooking and the diaper
changing. It's simply not fair that women monopolize all those
jobs. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a lot of blather about how the Internet interfaces with
democracy, but some things make it all seem real. www.scorecard.org
is as real as hot dogs.
</P>
<P>
   This website, set up a year ago by the Environmental Defense
Fund, turns the modern data deluge into a jet hose pointed at
polluters. It allows anybody with a modem to find out who is
emitting what into his neighborhood, and to protest instantly.
</P>
<P>
   An old lopsidedness in democracy _ big business and big
government are better informed than individuals, so win most of the
big arguments _ is suddenly corrected.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that executives and bureaucrats could assure
small-fry citizens that problems had been analyzed, scientists
consulted, safeguards put in place.
</P>
<P>
   Now citizens no longer need to accept those assurances
helplessly. They can log on to the Internet and check them, with a
few clicks of a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Scorecard combines a vast reservoir of scientific data with
software that makes it accessible to the layman-activist. When you
arrive at the website, you can slot in your zip code and get a list
of the top ten polluters in your neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Click on the worst offender, and you get a draft letter, which
you are free to edit, asking why the culprit has failed to bring
down its emissions as much as other local firms. Click on the send
button, and the letter flies down a fax line to the plant's
manager.
</P>
<P>
   You can also e-mail the Environmental Protection Agency in
Washington, or make contact with fellow greens in your
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   A cover headline in Chemical Week magazine captured the
industry's anxious early response to this. ``The Internet Bomb,''
it read.
</P>
<P>
   Ranking neighborhood polluters is only a fraction of what
Scorecard offers. You can rank offenders by industry, or by type of
pollution: Scorecard will generate league tables of carcinogen
producers, animal-waste dumpers, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   If you are suing a big drug company, you can trawl for damning
data to leak to the press.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to put pressure on your governor to clean up the
environment, you can call up a league table ranking states
according to green indices: if he protests that he has done all he
can to cut pollution, you can point out that others have done more.
</P>
<P>
   David Roe, one of Scorecard's principal creators, preaches the
gospel of democratizing information.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the 1970s and early 1980s, he remembers, environmental
legislation floundered: the 1970 Clean Air Act, for example, was
meant to result in emissions standards being set for 200 toxic
chemicals, but after more than a decade only six had been regulated
in this way.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated, environmentalists switched their campaigning efforts
in a new direction. Rather than call on government to curb
pollution, they called for disclosure of emissions data.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 they won this battle: a federal reporting requirement
was enacted, and California passed a ballot initiative that Roe had
drafted, requiring another layer of disclosure from state firms.
</P>
<P>
   The results are striking. By 1996 emissions of chemicals covered
in the legislation had fallen by 72 percent in California and by 45
percent in America as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   The question is how far Scorecard will increase this impact.
Many expect big changes. Greens in other countries are impressed by
Scorecard: Britain's Friends of the Earth has just launched its own
website copying it, and a plan is in the works to export the idea
to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Activists in other fields put faith in the idea of instant
Internet disclosure: a new ballot initiative in California, for
example, would require political candidates to report campaign
donations over the Internet within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the lobbyists who schmooze in Congress know that
they face a new source of competition. People all over the country
are e-mailing their representatives, often pressing them to take
positions inimical to those of the lobbyists' corporate clients.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the significance of Scorecard is uncertain. The website
attracts a huge amount of traffic _ around ten times more than the
Environmental Protection Agency's competing site. But quite what
people are doing with this data is mysterious.
</P>
<P>
   Scorecard's creators reckon that, in peak months last year, the
site's users sent about 1,000 protest faxes to polluters. That is a
pinprick. Besides, even if the number of protests multiplied, their
effect on policy would remain murky, thanks to the political
equivalent of Newton's third law.
</P>
<P>
   For every action in American democracy, an equal and opposite
reaction can usually be expected. In the case of green e-mail, the
reaction will probably come in several versions.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations will devise routine responses: they will program
their computers to recognize protesting faxes, and to send back
stock replies.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, corporations will hire consultants to generate
artificial grass-roots e-mail in support of their own positions, to
balance out the e-mail that congressmen receive from green
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Pestered from all sides, congressmen will have difficulty
distinguishing between genuine grass-roots indignation and the
astro-turf protests paid for by polluters. As a result, they will
stop worrying about the contents of their e-mail bags.
</P>
<P>
   Something like this has already befallen traditional letter
writing, and this suggests a disturbing theory about Scorecard's
eventual impact.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s and 1960s, letters to congressmen were relatively
rare, and so they were taken seriously, just as e-mail is today.
But by the 1970s professionally orchestrated letter-writing
campaigns began to undermine the letter-writers' impact.
</P>
<P>
   The slicker the letter-writers grew, the more congressmen were
inclined to dismiss their work as artificial.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, politicians grew increasingly cynical about people
seeking to influence them one way or the other: if they wanted to
know what their constituents were thinking, they called in the
pollsters and ignored their mail bags.
</P>
<P>
   It would be ironic indeed if the Internet revolution, celebrated
now as a catalyst for reinvigorated citizen participation, were
likewise confounded: if websites like Scorecard merely ended up
enhancing the power of professional consultants and their opinion
polls. &QL;

   TOKYO _ The news of Renault's deal with Nissan was managed in a
very Japanese way.
</P>
<P>
   It dribbled out in bits and pieces, so that when Renault's
chairman, Louis Schweitzer, arrived last week to sign the deal to
take a $5.4 billion, 36.8 percent stake in the distressed Japanese
car maker, everything had been said.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Renault's arrival lacked the drama of a Wall Street
takeover, it still sent a charge of excitement through Japan's
boardrooms.

<P>
   A year ago, only the wild-eyed were suggesting that Nissan's
backward managers might agree to join with a rival. That the
partner might be a gaijin (foreign) firm was unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   Yet things are changing in Japan. Last year, Japanese firms were
involved in 908 mergers and acquisitions, 35 percent more than in
1997 and more than double the 1993 figure.
</P>
<P>
   There have been plenty more so far this year: between Mitsubishi
Chemical and Tokyo Tanabe, a pharmaceuticals firm; between two big
banks, Chuo Trust and Mitsui Trust; and, following Renault's
purchase, between Calsonic and Kansei, two car-parts makers
affiliated with Nissan.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Cable &AMP; Wireless and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
(NTT), two telecoms giants, were slugging it out for Japan's
International Digital Communications (IDC), the first time a
foreign company has come up against a domestic one in a takeover
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with other countries, Japan's merger boomlet hardly
registers. In America last year, 11,400 mergers were announced. Yet
this activity is precisely the reason why Japanese mergers could
now take off.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with foreign rivals, Japanese companies in a surprising
number of industries are now either too small or too dependent on
their home market.
</P>
<P>
   This gap is widest in banking, telecoms and pharmaceuticals,
where mergers among foreign competitors have been the most intense.
</P>
<P>
   NTT has the bulk to compete with anyone _ it is still the
world's biggest telecoms company by sales. But it is woefully short
of foreign business in a globalizing industry, which is why it is
chasing IDC, a small international carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Some Japanese banks have big foreign operations. But they all
lack size, which determines how much they can spend on technology,
and therefore, increasingly, how competitive they are.
</P>
<P>
   Only one, the ``mighty'' Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, is, in terms
of revenues, among the world's 20 biggest banks: it ranks 16th.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese pharmaceutical companies combine both weaknesses.
Takeda, whose sales make it the biggest of Japan's drug firms,
earns less than a third of the revenues of America's Merck or
Britain's Glaxo Wellcome.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, foreign sales in lucrative markets such as America
and Germany account for only 16 percent of Takeda's overall
revenues and 19 percent at rival Sankyo, compared with 41 percent
at American Home Products or 80 percent at SmithKline Beecham, a
British drug company.
</P>
<P>
   Garry Evans of HSBC, a British bank, reckons that this year
there will be more mergers in the pharmaceuticals industry than in
any other.
</P>
<P>
   Now other manufacturers are at it too. The capital-goods
industry is still in reasonable shape, as are consumer-electronics
firms such as Sony and Matsushita, but the car makers look more
wobbly.
</P>
<P>
   Small local suppliers are a large part of the problem. As the
biggest car companies try to bolt together global businesses, they
naturally want parts companies that can supply their brakes and air
conditioners worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Japan, parts makers are coming together: America's TRW,
for instance, recently bought Britain's LucasVarity. Except for
Bosch's purchase of a majority stake in Zexel, a Japanese parts
maker, in February, it is not yet happening in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Merger activity in Japan could really take off if reforms in the
country come to anything. More deregulation would help this, by
pitching Japanese managers against better-capitalized and more
diversified international rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's ``big bang'' financial deregulation is already doing
just that, with American firms such as GE Capital, Citigroup and
Merrill Lynch buying or building financial businesses in markets
that were once protected.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the liberalization of oil imports in 1996 has
convinced Japan's oil firms that their business is overcrowded.
Last year Nippon Oil and Mitsubishi Oil merged to create Japan's
biggest oil company, with 24 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   The government is beginning to remove some of the legal and
regulatory barriers to mergers. The Justice Ministry, for instance,
plans to rewrite Japan's commercial code to oblige minority
shareholders to sell their stakes to an acquiring firm once a
majority agrees to the takeover.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, minority shareholders can refuse to sell if they
do not like the deal, which makes it difficult for one company to
buy all of another one. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (200-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 800) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Minority shareholders tend to block mergers if they are paid
with the buyer's shares, because they must immediately pay taxes on
their capital gain. So the finance ministry may now exempt these
shareholders from capital-gains taxes, unless they sell their
shares.
</P>
<P>
   A big remaining obstacle is Japan's network of
cross-shareholdings, which offer companies the protection of
friendly supplier- and banker-owners. Such links are beginning to
loosen; but, with more than 40 percent of shares owned by other
companies, it could take decades to unravel.
</P>
<P>
   Two recent developments, however, should speed things up. One is
the restructuring of Japan's banks, the biggest owners of Japanese
companies. Financial distress, or regulatory pressure, may push
them into selling their shareholdings.
</P>
<P>
   The other is a proposal from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party
to solve the underfunding of company pension schemes, which Goldman
Sachs, an investment bank, estimates is an YEN 80 trillion ($670
billion) problem. This would let firms bolster their pension
schemes with shareholdings in other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Attitudes among shareholders would really start to change if
this were accompanied by rules requiring pension-fund trustees to
manage their investments in the interests of fund members, as

<P>
   That leaves the small problem of the old men who run Japan's
companies. It is they who are most to blame for the rarity of
mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Everything about the way Japanese boardrooms work seems to
conspire to produce inaction _ the ``face-saving'' avoidance of
painful announcements; the requirement that radical change demands
resignations; the fetishization of consensus-building, which makes
any sort of big decision difficult.
</P>
<P>
   This works not only to prevent mergers, but also to poison those
that do occur if, after merging, there is no change in management
or strategy.
</P>
<P>
   A few of Japan's boardrooms are changing. Forward-thinkers, such
as Sony, Fuji Photo and Toshiba are leading the way by slashing the
size of their boards, shedding advisers and devolving day-to-day
responsibilities to their managers.
</P>
<P>
   But Kathy Matsui of Goldman Sachs points to the lack of change
that has recently disappointed investors involved in three mergers
_ between Mitsubishi Kasei and Mitsubishi Petrochemical; between
Yamashita-Shinnihon Steamship and Japan Line; and between Chichibu
Cement and Onoda Cement.
</P>
<P>
   That Renault has gone and bought its stake in Nissan without
winning management control of the company should make Schweitzer's
shareholders sweat too. &QL;

   TOKYO _ The news of Renault's deal with Nissan was managed in a
very Japanese way.
</P>
<P>
   It dribbled out in bits and pieces, so that when Renault's
chairman, Louis Schweitzer, arrived last week to sign the deal to
take a $5.4 billion, 36.8 percent stake in the distressed Japanese
car maker, everything had been said.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Renault's arrival lacked the drama of a Wall Street
takeover, it still sent a charge of excitement through Japan's
boardrooms.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, only the wild-eyed were suggesting that Nissan's
backward managers might agree to join with a rival. That the
partner might be a gaijin (foreign) firm was unthinkable.

conspire to produce inaction _ the ``face-saving'' avoidance of
painful announcements; the requirement that radical change demands
resignations; the fetishization of consensus-building, which makes
any sort of big decision difficult.
</P>
<P>
   This works not only to prevent mergers, but also to poison those
that do occur if, after merging, there is no change in management
or strategy.
</P>
<P>
   A few of Japan's boardrooms are changing. Forward-thinkers, such
as Sony, Fuji Photo and Toshiba are leading the way by slashing the
size of their boards, shedding advisers and devolving day-to-day
responsibilities to their managers.
</P>
<P>
   But Kathy Matsui of Goldman Sachs points to the lack of change
that has recently disappointed investors involved in three mergers
_ between Mitsubishi Kasei and Mitsubishi Petrochemical; between
Yamashita-Shinnihon Steamship and Japan Line; and between Chichibu
Cement and Onoda Cement.
</P>
<P>
   That Renault has gone and bought its stake in Nissan without
winning management control of the company should make Schweitzer's
shareholders sweat too. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Gates is often compared to John D. Rockefeller, but the
closer parallel might be between Steve Ballmer and John D.
Archbold, the co-pilots of Microsoft now and Standard Oil 100 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Both got to know the industry titans in their early days,
Archbold as a surrogate son and court jester, Ballmer as a college
housemate and poker buddy.
</P>
<P>
   And both took over daily operations at a time when their company
was fighting a crucial antitrust battle, the first in 1897, the
latter in July last year.
</P>
<P>
   Archbold proved to be exactly the wrong choice to head Standard
Oil. He financed overseas expansion by keeping domestic prices
high, inflaming public opinion and fueling the political pressure
to break the company up.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer is about to be put to the same test.
</P>
<P>
   He has just made his first big move as Microsoft's president,
designing the long-awaited restructuring the firm announced on
March 29.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft will no longer be organized around products such as
operating systems, but rather around customer groups: IT managers,
wired employees, developers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer hopes this will inspire programmers to write the
software that customers want _ not products dictated by the
mushrooming Microsoft bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   It is understandable that Ballmer would want to undertake such a
reorganization. Before he was promoted, he spent six years as
Microsoft's chief salesman. It was Ballmer and his team who took
the telephone calls from angry customers who complained again and
again about software that is difficult to install, crashes
regularly and has too many unwieldy features.
</P>
<P>
   What is more surprising is that he has been given the chance.
When Ballmer gets excited, it's time to unpack the earplugs.
Dressing down subordinates, he can be heard echoing through the
air-conditioning vents at Microsoft. His maniacal shouting has
already resulted in throat surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer's verbal outbursts have also hurt his company's
reputation. Shortly after the Department of Justice began its
latest battle with Microsoft in October 1997, he bellowed at
reporters: ``To heck with (Attorney-General) Janet Reno.'' A few
weeks later at a trade show, he screamed ``What the consumer needs
is more, more, more Windows.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he regrets those comments, and wants to ``stop saying
stupid things.''
</P>
<P>
   But when this big, balding man starts gesticulating wildly to
make a point, one minute a tyrant, the next a little boy, you
wonder whether his efforts to tone himself down can possibly last.
As Gates says, Ballmer ``exudes exuberance.''
</P>
<P>
   This huge personality has undoubtedly shaped Microsoft's
corporate culture _ more, some even argue, than Gates himself.
</P>
<P>
   Since joining the company in 1980, after marketing cake mixes at
Procter &AMP; Gamble and dropping out of Stanford University business
school, he has become a sort of rapid intervention force.
</P>
<P>
   Without his relentless salesmanship, the software firm would
have been much less commercially successful. He regularly called up
customers who had chosen competitors' products _ sometimes, it is
said, with dire threats.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly that alone should have disqualified Ballmer from the
top job at Microsoft at a time when it is accused of being a
reckless monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   And he is a rum choice to teach superaggressive Microsofties to
play by the rules _ something the antitrust proceedings have shown
they need to learn.
</P>
<P>
   If Microsoft is officially declared a monopoly, an unBallmerish
restraint will become essential. Should the court go further and
order ``structural'' remedies of the kind the Department of Justice
would like _ perhaps including the forced licensing of Windows to
competitors _ Microsoft would have to reinvent itself.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a more favorable legal outcome, Ballmer faces
difficult times ahead.
</P>
<P>
   It is no longer fanciful to suggest that Microsoft's big,
fully-featured computer-operating systems could go the way of IBM's
all-conquering mainframes. This is, in part, its own fault.
</P>
<P>
   To protect and expand its monopoly, it has added ever more
features to Windows, turning it into a hairball of software.
Development of Windows 2000 is already more than two years behind
schedule, because bugs multiply as fast as Microsoft's programmers
can splat them.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, the world is no longer going Microsoft's way.
Televisions, telephones, and portable organizers with mini
operating systems threaten the hegemony of the Windows-based PC;
Linux, a rival operating system, is gaining ground; firms are
starting to rent both software and processing power.
</P>
<P>
   Money is moving from software to services, where Microsoft has
little worthwhile experience. It has, for example, invested huge
sums in its consumer websites, and made no money.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer seems to be aware of this weakness, moving his office to
the division that produces online services.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft still has time to shift its amazingly lucrative
business, and nobody should underestimate the intelligence and
energy it will bring to bear when it decides it has to.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Ballmer is the right person to drive Microsoft over the
bumpy road ahead is another matter. He has the brutality and
insider knowledge to impose painful choices. Yet should Gates
withdraw further from the day-to-day running of the company,
Ballmer may lack the techie credentials necessary to carry
Microsoft's talented engineers into new fields.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest danger, though, is that Ballmer channels his
terrifying dynamism into a fight to the finish for Windows. If he
does, he will go down in history as the Archbold of the digital
age. &QL;

INVESTORS' 401(K)S SEEM HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 04, 1999)  
 (Eds.: Includes correction of previous column.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I are in our mid-forties and both of us work for
the same non-profit employer. We both put 10 percent of our pay
into our 401(k) accounts, and a percentage of this is matched by
our employer. Together we earn $62,000 a year. My wife has been
there for five years and has $20,000, all of it invested in
Fidelity Growth and Income fund. I have been there for two years,
and have $4,800 in my account, all of it in Fidelity Contrafund. I
also have $2,000 in a regular IRA. Except for a few shares of
stock, the 401(k) accounts represent out main retirement nest egg.
We just refinanced our mortgage, which now is to be paid off over
15 years. Is our portfolio diversified enough? Will we have enough
to retire when we reach age 65? Should I convert my IRA to a Roth,
or should I roll it into the 401(k)?
</P>
<P>
   R.T., Eugene, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   A. Let's begin with the critical question: Will you have enough
to retire? To a large degree, that depends on how much is that
unspecified percentage that your employer adds to those 401(k)
accounts. Let's suppose that your employer matches by putting in 50
cents for every $1 from yourself or your wife. If that were the
case, and if contributions remained at current levels for 20 years,
and if you achieved average annual portfolio returns of 10 percent,
you would amass a pool of $737,280. If your employer's contribution
is 25 cents for each $1 you contribute, the pool would be $644,449.
If your employer quit contributing entirely, you still would amass
$551,619.
</P>
<P>
   Let's assume that among those three projections the middle
ground is closest to your situation, so you'll have a $644,449
pool. If you invested that money in a fixed-income pool that
produces an average yield of 6.5 percent, it would bring you
$41,889 a year. That works out to 67.6 percent of your current
income stream -- which is roughly what most people figure they will
need in retirement. Moreover, if you'll qualify for Social
Security, so much the better; in fact, in all likelihood quite a
bit for the better.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the ugly part -- inflation. If you had $41,889 in the
year 2019 and inflation averaged 3.5 percent annually between now
and then, it would have the same buying power as $21,051 in today's
money. You would need $83,350 to buy the same goods and services
that $41,889 buys today. And to produce an income stream of $83,350
you would need a little more than $1.25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there are several factors working in your favor. One is
that you're likely to get raises during those intervening 20 years,
and if you continue contributing 10 percent and if your employer
continues to match your higher contributions, the pool would be
larger than projected above. Second, there's always the possibility
of Social Security. Third, although you consider the few shares of
stock insignificant at this point, since you didn't specify their
value I couldn't plug them into the formula. (I did add the IRA
in.) If those shares are worth $500 and their growth tracked that
of the rest of the portfolio, you could add $3,363; not a terribly
big deal, but it helps.
</P>
<P>
   But most important, the projection above presumed that you
maintained all of your principal, withdrawing only its yield.
Certainly in the later years of retirement, there is no problem
with people slowly depleting their capital -- you just do a
projection of a very high life span such as 100 years and then
figure how much you might withdraw so that if you live to be 100,
you'll have one things -- a letter from the President. What you
won't have is money, but most people are willing to make that
modest bet against themsleves.
</P>
<P>
   Is your portfolio diversified enough? What diversification? Both
Fidelity Growth and Income and Fidelity Contrafund are domestic
large-cap funds with their portfolios representing a blend of
growth- and value-oriented issues. The growth and income fund is
probably more conservative, carrying a below-average risk score
from Morningstar Mutual Funds (compared to an average risk rating
for Contrafund) but at bottom they're mighty similar.
</P>
<P>
   If I were you, I would leave about 60 percent of each 401(k)
accounts in your current holdings, and spread the remainder out
evenly among a mid-cap fund, a small-cap fund, an international
fund, and a health care fund. That presumes, of course, that your
401(k) has a menu of investments sufficiently broad to allow such
moves. If not, get as close as you can, perhaps using a balanced
fund such as Fidelity Puritan if you can't find anything in one of
those categories. And since very few 401(k) plans offer sector
funds, rather than rolling the IRA into your 401(k), why not roll
it over into a Rollover IRA invested in Fidelity Select Health Care
fund?
</P>
<P>
   Q. I would appreciate it if you would look at my investments.
I'm 62 years old and will retire in 12 to 30 months. If I do work
30 months, I should have enough money to live on just relying on my
pension and Social Security. I want my investments to provide
enough money to take care of car expenses, travel and inflation --
perhaps $16,000 to $20,000 a year. I list the holdings on a
separate sheet. I also have property in Florida which I plan to
sell, expecting proceeds of about $50,000. Where should I invest
it? Should I start consolidating the funds I already have?
</P>
<P>
   R.G., Kingston, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. What can I say -- you've done it right. Even though your list
seems imposing, it boils down to 20 accounts spread over 15
different investments. After making some guesses (such as how a
variable annuity is invested) and treating all balanced funds as
50/50 stocks and bonds, I came up with $140,750 on the fixed-income
side and $88,850 in stock investments.
</P>
<P>
   Let's suppose you take that $50,000 and use it to build your
position in Fidelity Puritan. That would take your stock position
to a little more than $40,000, and would leave you with $165,750 on
the fixed-income side. That would be sufficient to provide you with
$897 a month without invading principal, presuming you achieved an
average 6.5 percent yield from the fixed portfolio -- a likely
assumption since your holdings are dominated by mortgage
securities.
</P>
<P>
   Let's also suppose that your needs work out to $18,000 a year,
or $1,500 a month. What would happen if you simply withdrew $603 a
month from the stock portfolio? Nothing horrible. If you got only
6.5 percent returns from the stocks, you would stand still. If the
stock side did better, you would see some very tidy growth. How
tidy? Well, if you achieved average 10 percent returns and made
those withdrawals, the stock portfolio would grow from $113,850 to
$380,777 over the course of 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   This certainly isn't the fast track, but it's a nice
conservative approach to a portfolio that's more than ample to meet
your needs, so I see no risk to change from your current
conservative orientation. And unless you find tracking the
portfolio troublesome, I see no problem with having your money
spread among 15 different investments. In fact, the only change of
any sort that I would suggest is, of course, to get that $11,000
out of the credit union where it's earning 3 percent and get it in
a mutual fund money market fund, where you might see returns move
to the 4.5 percent area. This would mean have very little loss of
liquidity. And since I'll let you keep $5,000 loafing in the bank
at 2 percent, you'll still have a way to get emergency cash fast.
</P>

CORRECTION &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In last Sunday's column (March 28), I recommended that an
investor buy Vanguard Health Care fund, relying on what turned out
to be outdated information in the summary issue of the Morningstar
Mutual Funds reports. The fund was closed to new investors several
weeks ago. As I have often said in this column, Vanguard Health
Care is my favorite fund in the health care category, focusing
primarily on stocks of pharmaceutical companies and medical
equipment companies (rather than on health care delivery and
biotechs). Fidelity Select Health Care is an excellent proxy for
the Vanguard fund, and now for most people it is the best choice in
the category.

COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE SEAPORT SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.Y., Calif., Texas, La., S.C.)  (mk) 
 By CATHERINE HOLLINGSWORTH   
 N.Y. Times Regional Newspaper Group   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Most vacationers who board cruise ships see
bustling ports simply as a gateway to fun and sun. But federal
authorities say seaports can be paradise for criminals.
</P>
<P>
   For thieves looking to quickly export ill-gotten gains or nab
valuable shipments of designer clothes, computers and other
high-end goods, ports are a popular destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crooks know the system very well and know the cracks in
the system,'' said Ed Badolato, chairman of the Washington-based
National Cargo Security Council. ``Crooks have too much access to
shipping records. That's why crime has skyrocketed through the
roof.''
</P>
<P>
   Cargo theft costs companies an estimated $10 billion a year.
Over the decades, it has gone from pilfering, say, a case of
liquor, to conspiring to intercept entire loads of merchandise. The
scheme often requires an organized effort with help from truckers,
dock workers or other insiders.
</P>
<P>
   Taking note of this growing problem, President Clinton intends
to establish a national commission to combat seaport crime and beef
up port security.
</P>
<P>
   The Graham Commission on Seaport Crime and Security, named after
Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., who originated the idea, is scheduled to
be unveiled in the coming weeks when members of Congress return
from recess.
</P>
<P>
   The president was immediately receptive to Graham's plan when
the two men first discussed it last May, said an aide to Graham.
</P>
<P>
   After several visits to Florida's ports, Graham noticed a
recurring set of problems related to seaports, the staffer said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to cargo theft, the commission will explore drug
trafficking, terrorist activity, illegal car exports, smuggling of
illegal immigrants, exchange of counterfeit money and imports of
banned food.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, Transportation Secretary Rodney
Slater and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin will lead the
presidential commission and appoint up to 25 members from federal
agencies, according to Graham's staff. The panel will make
recommendations to Clinton on improving maritime security.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Graham wanted to introduce legislation dealing with
cargo theft but it was too difficult to set standards for entities
governed by an array of local, state and federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Many local port authorities are recognizing the need for better
security and are planning such basic improvements as better
lighting, restricted access to yards and more thorough background
checks, Graham's staffer said.
</P>
<P>
   Most cargo theft occurs at major ports in New York, South
Florida and Southern California in a region Badolato calls the
``Bermuda Triangle,'' where 80 percent of the cargo disappears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drugs have basically driven the movement to make the ports
more secure,'' said Mike Sinclair, chief inspector for the U.S.
Customs Service at Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that the Everglades port and the Port of Miami
were the main entry points for drugs, he said. Now agents are
seeing narcotics turn up more often at ports in Houston, New
Orleans, and Charleston, S.C. The mere proximity of a port can make
some cities vulnerable to crime such as auto theft, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Seaports handle 95 percent of U.S. trade but some port
executives say they rarely see cargo theft.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kornegay, executive director of the Port of Houston and
chairman of the American Association of Port Authorities, said, ``I
don't think it's a big issue with us.''
</P>
<P>
   He said losing a couple of shipping containers a year out of the
thousands the port handles is ``pretty low. We have pretty tight
security.''

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, April 4, will move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kosovo-related stories &LR;  (Moving in the `i' category):
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-ORTHODOX-REVIEW (Undated) _ The NATO attack on Serbia has
provoked strong opposition from many Eastern Orthodox Christians
and nations, raising the question whether there is in fact an
`Orthodox world' in the East that differs fundamentally from the
West in its values and principles, that perceives the NATO attacks
not as a moral crusade against a clear evil, but as a hypocritical
Western assault against an Eastern Orthodox nation. By Serge
Schmemann. (on the section dress page)
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-POWELL-REVIEW (Washington) _ The Powell Doctrine was a
strict and cautious policy _ espoused by Gen. Colin Powell when he
was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff _ holding that the U.S.
should intervene militarily only when its vital interests are at
stake, only with decisive force, and only when there is a clear
goal and a defined strategy for getting out. After the 1991 Gulf
war, this idea was discarded as a post-Vietnam relic unsuited to
today's world. But the debacle in Kosovo is suddenly making
Powell's principles look more attractive. By Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-HITECH-REVIEW (Undated) _ Slobodan Milosevic must be
laughing at U.S. threats to use high technology to hold him
accountable. Three years after the U.S. vowed to uncover evidence
of mass executions at Srebrenica, it seems clear that there are
limits to U.S. technology and that technology can be rendered
superfluous if it is used to mask a lack of political will. By
David Rohde.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-BALKANS-OUTLOOK-REVIEW _ Early summary: some
prognistications on what the Balkan region may be like two or three
years from now. By Roger Cohen. (on the section dress page)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Other stories &LR;  (Moving in the `a' category):
</P>
<P>
   COMMUNITY-POLICING-REVIEW (Undated) _ New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani has ostentatiously rejected proposals to implement
community policing, deriding such programs as turning police
officers into social workers. But, perhaps to Giuliani's surprise,
community policing is alive and working successfully in many
cities, from Chicago to San Diego and from Fort Wayne to Fort
Worth. By Fox Butterfield. (on the section dress page)
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER-PRIVACY-REVIEW (San Francisco) _ Hidden in the
Microsoft Word document that carried the Melissa virus around the
world was an innocuous serial number that may help identify the
computer with which the program was written. It is a powerful
illustration of how technology has growing power for promoting both
good and evil, and is the heart of arguments over tradeoffs between
individual privacy rights and the common good. By John Markoff.
</P>
<P>
   SOCSEC-MEDICARE-REVIEW (Washington) _ The trustees report'
extending the projected solvency of Social Security and Medicare by
a few years was political manna for Congress. It made the problem
seem less urgent and provided an excuse for postponing tough
decisions until after the next elections. But demographic data
buried in the trustees' report illustrated why the matter cannot be
put off indefinitely. By David E. Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   BBO-MCGWIRE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Mark McGwire's eyes lit up.
Expecting another `Can you hit 70 home runs again?'
question-and-answer fest, the St. Louis slugger was treated to the
first-ever reverse interview: He got to put questions to other
people, for a change. By Alan Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   DEPORT-VETERANS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Recent laws requiring the
deportation of resident aliens for minor offenses are being
challenged by supporters of several U.S. military veterans who face
expulsion under the law. Through legal challenges and a publicity
campaign on behalf of the veterans (at least one of who is disabled
due to combat wounds) the law's opponents are targeting what they
hope will prove to be its Achilles' heel: its extreme
inflexibility. By Mirta Ojita.
</P>
<P>
   SATIRICAL-WEBSITES-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at Web sites that
make fun of companies. The sites allow disgruntled consumers to
express themselves. The target companies don't seem to see the
humor in this, so they're fighting back with their most familiar
weapon: money. By Timothy L. O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   BIBLE-BOOKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The publishing industry _ no
stranger to overstatement _ has for a long time been cranking out
multitudes of `bibles' on popular subjects _ the Barbecue Bible,
the Bartender's Bible, etc.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ The confusion over the definition of
a blue moon, and some other highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-LANGUAGE-REVIEW (Tokyo) _ Many middle-aged and elderly
Japanese must struggle through what seems like an endless language
school. In restaurants, in stores, in newspapers, on TV and in
conversation with young people, they find themselves bewildered by
what seems like an explosion of English and other foreign-language
terms. By Nicholas D. Kristof.

 CRIME
<TEXT>
<P>
   BY MARILYN STASIO
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Perfect beauty takes many blinding guises in A SIGHT FOR SORE
EYES (Crown, $24), a suspense novel by Ruth Rendell that is itself
a flawless piece of craftsmanship. But to the tormented characters
who obsessively pursue their objects of desire -- including a
redheaded woman, a mint-condition Edsel and the reflection of the
beholder's own face in the mirror -- the worship of beauty leads
directly to murder and madness.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell charts a harrowing collision course for two
preternaturally beautiful teen-agers: Teddy Brex, an unloved child
who grows up to be a sociopath, and Francine Hill, an overprotected
child who grows up to be his ideal victim. Life has taught Teddy
that people are ugly and unkind; but since ``looking at beauty took
away pain and hurt,'' no deed committed to acquire that beauty is
too cruel or too crazy. Teddy may be twisted, but in the author's
bold, imaginative view he is sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching back a generation to get more traction for her macabre
love story, Rendell takes a ruthless probe to every person (from
Teddy's emotionally arrested parents to the faceless stranger who
murdered Francine's mother) who had a hand in shaping the psyches
of this ill-met pair. Spare and unforgiving, these incisive
character studies illuminate the darker corners of Teddy's and
Francine's family histories without dimming the originality of
their bizarre lives.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Pigeon, the intrepid park ranger who has braved forest
fires, underground rockslides and killer mountain cats in Nevada
Barr's wilderness mysteries, nearly caves in to the urban terrors
of Manhattan in LIBERTY FALLING (Putnam, $23.95). Keeping vigil by
day at her sister's hospital bed, Anna flees by night to national
park grounds in New York Harbor, where a ranger friend is putting
her up on Liberty Island. Although there's no escaping the
``flotsam of noise and tension'' that washes up from the city, Anna
finds a kind of peace accompanying Lady Liberty's attendants on
their nightly rounds and prowling the abandoned hospital buildings
on Ellis Island -- until a young girl falls from the Statue of
Liberty and one of the rangers starts seeing ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   Barr keeps her distance from the wildlife on the mainland
(wisely, since her impressions of Times Square are way out of date)
to concentrate on those loner types who live on islands and work
the late shift. Although Anna has some quietly moving scenes with
such characters, she's more in her element on her nocturnal walks
through the crumbling buildings and rank gardens of Ellis Island.
Barr writes with hypnotic lyricism of these decaying ruins, where
``Nature was taking back what had once been hers'' by pushing green
shoots up from the mold. It isn't the Grand Canyon, but to a
naturalist like Barr, the place is teeming with life.
</P>
<P>
   The Southwestern Indians in Kirk Mitchell's CRY DANCE (Bantam,
$23.95) are pretty amazing. They can tell at a glance which of the
550 extant Native American tribes a person belongs to, and they
know every inch of the tribal territories that span the Great Basin
region of Arizona, Nevada, Utah and California. Uninitiated
readers, however, might have some trouble distinguishing among the
Havasupai, the Chemehuevi and the Paiute -- or just figuring out
where they are in this involving but unfocused story.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody understands money, though, and we get the picture when
a string of mutilation-murders coincides with secret land deals
being struck by some shady Indian entrepreneurs for a multitribal
gambling casino. Emmett Parker, a weather-beaten Comanche
investigator for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, also sees the
connection, but his concern for a pretty rookie partner working
undercover as a casino dealer distracts him from deciphering the
cryptic message of the mutilations. (Let it be said that ``loss of
face'' has quite a different meaning for an Indian.) Although the
overplotted and overpopulated narrative doesn't give Emmett much
chance to examine his feelings about his mixed heritage, there are
plenty of strenuous treks through rugged terrain to show us what a
superb tracker he is -- and what a great guy to keep around for
next time.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from an opening that gives away the killer and an ending
that flies over the top, JITTER JOINT (St. Martin's, $21.95) is a
fine, prickly first mystery from Howard Swindle, a Dallas newsman
with a nose for offbeat dramatic situations. Jeb Quinlin, a
homicide cop nursing an alcoholic death wish, is shanghaied by his
estranged wife and fed-up captain and packed off to ``whisky
school,'' occasioning some heartfelt writing in strong scenes set
on the detox ward and in the group therapy sessions run by a
sadistic psychiatrist. Midway through Jeb's treatment, someone
starts killing present and former patients of the Dallas clinic,
and the detective is yanked out of rehab to chase down this lunatic
before he gets to Jeb's new girlfriend -- or to Jeb himself.
Swindle's tensed-up style adapts well to the action scenes on the
outside, and Jeb shows the steel (and the right kind of cowboy
boots) to keep his macho image intact.
</P>
<P>
   Lovejoy, the cheeky hero of Jonathan Gash's exuberant comic
mysteries, is back on the con game in THE RICH AND THE PROFANE
(Viking, $22.95). Antiques dealer, restorer, forger and sometime
thief, this jack of rogues takes on yet another persona when he
impersonates a pop music impresario and produces a splashy variety
show on the English Channel island of Guernsey -- clever cover for
an ingenious art fraud that draws the suckers like flies. How
Lovejoy got to Guernsey is another funny story, which begins with
his chivalrous attempt to teach a young woman how to steal an
Edwardian necklace from an auction house and leads to the
inevitable schemes to ``rescue'' Chinese bronzes, Victorian cookie
tins, Rockingham pottery and other gorgeous goods from their
undeserving owners. After almost 20 years of doing business on the
dodgy side of the trade, Lovejoy is still a love and the joy he
brings to his work is undiminished.

 &UR; MEMBERS OF THE CLUB
</P>
<P>
   BY MARK DANNER
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Six decades ago, in a classroom at Groton, a young man rose
slowly to his feet, gazed down at a sheaf of papers in his hand,
and began to read. At the front of the room, his teacher sat back
and enjoyed a brilliant essay on the Duke of Marlborough,
brilliantly delivered -- and marred only by a scattering of barely
suppressed giggles. Baffled, the teacher later drew one of the
young man's classmates aside and asked about the laughter. ``Didn't
you know?'' the student said. ``He was unprepared. He was reading
from a blank piece of paper.''
</P>
<P>
   A half-century later, working as a magazine editor, I heard that
a dazzling lecture on nuclear strategy had been delivered the night
before at a Maryland university. After trying in vain to track down
a copy, I finally telephoned the university's president, who
graciously promised to send a tape. No, I said, the written text
would do just fine. ``Text?'' He laughed. ``I was sitting beside
him on the dais and I can tell you those papers Mac kept leafing
through were blank. He winged it. It was classic Bundy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Classic Bundy'': to two generations of scholars, Government
officials and foundation managers who knew McGeorge Bundy, the
phrase stood for glittering intellectual prowess, self-confidence
verging on arrogance, an aggressive approach to problems that
brooked no hesitation. Kai Bird, the author of this double
biography of McGeorge and his elder brother, William Putnam Bundy,
first confronted ``the Bundy legend,'' as he calls it, in November
1972, when Bundy, the former Harvard dean and former special
assistant for national security affairs to Presidents Kennedy and
Johnson, visited Bird's small college in Minnesota to answer
students' questions about the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   ``American soldiers were still coming home in body bags,'' Bird
writes. ``And now here was McGeorge Bundy -- a man we all knew as
one of the prime architects of the war -- waiting to take our
questions. His mere presence seemed an affront, an unspeakable act
of arrogance. Behind his clear-plastic-frame glasses, his bright
blue eyes gleamed with an icy intelligence. Trim and pink-cheeked,
Bundy was a handsome, almost boyish man . . . deftly responding to
earnest questions with a display of clipped, cool logic, a bit of
wryness and, if necessary, a cold bucket of condescension. . . . He
was certainly not apologetic. He confessed to nothing. Yet, neither
did he reject our passionate questions out of hand. He tried to
engage us and tried to explain, without actually saying so, that
the war -- his war -- had been somehow inevitable. This was hardly
a satisfying explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bundy's refusal to ``confess'' seems to have been profoundly
galling, and his appearance left Bird ``perplexed and curious to
know how such an intelligent man had become so intimately
associated with such a national disaster.'' Bird clearly intends
``The Color of Truth'' to provide an answer. For while he bills his
book as a biography, and writes at length about McGeorge Bundy's
early and later career -- and, in rather less vivid shades, about
the career of his older brother, William Bundy, who held senior
appointments in the C.I.A. and in the Defense and State Departments
and later became editor of Foreign Affairs -- ``The Color of
Truth'' is at its heart a ``Vietnam book'' and one that follows a
trail first broken by David Halberstam in ``The Best and the
Brightest.''
</P>
<P>
   That Bird pursues this path is by no means unwelcome; though we
live under the presiding cliche of a ``post-cold-war world,'' it is
still Vietnam that cuts across America's history. To pursue the
rationale of American officials as they took action --or failed to
-- during this decade's conflicts in the Balkans, Somalia, Rwanda
is inevitably to bump up against the controversies still
surrounding Vietnam. Despite George Bush's claim in 1991 to have
``buried the Vietnam syndrome once and for all,'' the years since
have proved that America and its leaders still live, half
paralyzed, in the shadow of America's longest war.
</P>
<P>
   It was a world McGeorge and William Bundy did much to shape.
Bird finds a striking conflict between their overwhelming
intelligence, which preceded them like a legend wherever they went,
and the foolishness of their course; and here too he follows
Halberstam, who had put the question squarely: ``Why had they
crossed the Rubicon? They were intelligent men, rational men, and
seemingly intelligent, rational men would have known the obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, Bird tells us, these intelligent, rational men did
know the obvious: that sending hundreds of thousands of American
troops to Vietnam, making it an American war, was unlikely to lead
to victory and might well lead to disaster. If they pushed forward
anyway, they were spurred on not mainly by their ignorance (as
young Bird and other antiwar protesters had assumed) but by the
political risks of turning back. Bird sees the Bundys' failure not
as an intellectual failure but as a failure of character -- a
failure to break ranks.
</P>
<P>
   The Bundys came from a ``good family,'' firmly linked to
America's small circle of other good families. Their father,
Harvey, was a powerful Boston attorney who had clerked for Oliver
Wendell Holmes. Their mother, the former Katherine Lawrence Putnam,
a celebrated charmer and social eccentric, was closely related to
the Cabots, Lowells, Lawrences and just about everyone else who
mattered in Boston's highly structured society.
</P>
<P>
   Another important connection was to Henry Stimson, the legendary
colonel (he preferred to be known by the Army rank he attained in
the Great War) who was Hoover's Secretary of State and, later,
Roosevelt's Secretary of War. Meeting Harvey and Katherine Bundy at
a Washington luncheon in 1931, the childless Stimson ``fell in love
with'' Harvey and his ``peppery wife,'' and at 43 Harvey Bundy,
having never spent a day in the Government's employ, became
Assistant Secretary of State; he would remain close to Stimson for
the rest of the colonel's life.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-BUNDY-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: colonel's life.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bundy's sons grew accustomed to meeting the colonel at their
home, to debating events of the day with the great man across their
dinner table. When the time came in 1945 for a tired and ill
Stimson to write his memoirs, advisers chose as his collaborator
the brilliant Mac Bundy, then 27 and a junior fellow at Harvard.
Bundy's intellectual qualifications were, even then, second to
none, but to Stimson they ranked distinctly behind his reliability.
As Bird writes, for the influential friends and associates of the
colonel, Bundy was ``a logical and easy choice, a bright young man
in whom they all could trust to work with great discretion.'' We
are in a particular world here -- the world of the Establishment,
where the greatest transgression was not failure but betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   Bird dwells at some length on a celebrated 1947 Harper's
Magazine article that Bundy ghostwrote for Stimson, defending
Truman's decision to drop an atomic bomb on Japan. The article was
instigated by Harvard's president, James B. Conant, who had sat on
the Interim Committee that had advised Truman and who had grown
worried by a nascent critical movement led by, as Conant put it
with not a little contempt, ``the sentimental and verbally minded''
-- by whom he meant, among others, Reinhold Niebuhr, Norman Cousins
and, especially, John Hersey, who had just recently published his
powerful report, ``Hiroshima,'' in The New Yorker. As Bird
demonstrates, in writing the article for Stimson Bundy relied in
considerable part on a memo prepared by his father, which was
studded with inaccuracies; he also delivered the manuscript for
vetting to Conant, who excised, among other important themes, the
entire discussion of whether the Japanese would have surrendered if
the Americans had agreed earlier to permit them to retain the
Emperor. For the essay's single most influential and powerful
argument -- the number of lives that an invasion of Japan would
have cost -- Stimson and his young scribe agreed, without evidence
or support, ``to use the nice round figure of one million
casualties.'' It was an instance of history written -- as Secretary
of State Dean Acheson put it on another occasion -- to be ``clearer
than the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years later, John F. Kennedy recognized in Bundy, then a
young and popular Harvard dean, this same unflagging loyalty.
(Bundy had demonstrated it at Harvard, where he had agreed to
``shield'' the university from Senator Joseph R. McCarthy's attacks
by protecting senior faculty but dismissing any junior -- untenured
-- professor who refused to testify to the Congressional
committees. Kennedy briefly considered naming Bundy his secretary
of state, thought better of it (``Two baby faces like mine and his
are just too much'') and appointed him instead his special
assistant for national security affairs. Here Bundy excelled,
choosing as his National Security Council staff intellectuals of
the highest caliber, and designating himself Kennedy's intellectual
``traffic cop.'' Kennedy delighted in the agility of Bundy's
operation. ``You can't beat brains,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bird's narrative of the Cuban missile crisis, however, makes you
wonder. By Bird's account, Bundy handled himself during the crisis
with uncharacteristic indecision, advocating first a naval
``quarantine'' of Cuba and then an air strike on the missiles --
though at times Bird seems unsure whether Bundy's vacillations
reflected his own changing views or Kennedy's directive to ``keep
the discussion going.'' Bird also uses the latest revelations about
the crisis -- that Kennedy had made a secret arrangement to remove
medium-range missiles from Turkey and had even, if it seemed war
was imminent, arranged to agree to such a trade publicly -- to show
that the missile crisis was less a model of hard-line crisis
management (whose supposed lessons were said to be so influential
in the management of the Vietnam War) than ``a story of human
fallibility, misinformation and simple misjudgment.'' The ultimate
revelation -- that unknown to American ``crisis managers,'' the
Soviet Union had stationed 41,000 Soviet troops in Cuba and armed
them with battlefield nuclear weapons, which they had, for a time,
authority to use -- makes this story, in the end, also one of
simple and terrifying luck.
</P>
<P>
   Bird's account also makes one reflect, and not for the first
time, that the obvious intelligence of Kennedy and his closest
aides, including McGeorge Bundy, tended to be undermined not only
by their inexperience but by the young President's political
weakness. Kennedy's public position during the missile crisis --
that he would accept nothing less than the removal of Soviet
missiles from Cuba, with no American quid pro quo -- followed
largely from his own earlier warnings to the Soviets and the
Cubans, which had themselves followed from the humiliation of the
Bay of Pigs. For the rest of his life Bundy never parted from the
contention that the Cuban missiles, which brought the world as
close as it has ever been to nuclear conflict, presented Kennedy
with a political threat, rather than the country with a military
one.
</P>
<P>
   Bird's treatment of the Bundys and Vietnam, though bolstered
with much admirable spadework, does not depend on any breathtaking
revelation from the archives. The Bundys well understood, he tells
us, that Vietnam was a colonial war, that South Vietnam had little
or no independent existence, that involving American forces in a
land war was bound to hold great risks for the United States, that
from the very beginning the chances of victory were not high. All
the arguments the antiwar protesters, and later many in Congress,
made with such vehemence the Bundys and their fellows had taken
account of long before, and the memorandums and studies and policy
papers are there to prove it. The Bundys and the others (``the
Harvards,'' as Lyndon Johnson called them) became involved in
Vietnam gradually, cautiously; and when finally, under Johnson,
they sent hundreds of thousands of American troops to Asia in 1965,
they did so with ``foreboding'' and a ``heavy heart.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-BUNDY-3RDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: ``heavy heart.'') &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the policy debate itself Bird is very good. He describes the
flurry of memos and arguments surrounding the decision to commit
heavily to South Vietnam. Among the most important are James
Forrestal's paper of May 1964, in which Forrestal, the China
specialist and National Security Council official, depicted a South
Vietnam in the throes of a social revolution the Americans would be
unable to prevent (``We are essentially on the wrong side,''
Forrestal wrote bluntly); Averell Harriman's extraordinary
memorandum, discovered after his death, in which he disclosed that
even before mid-1966 Robert McNamara had conceded the war was
unwinnable and the United States should negotiate a coalition
government in the South; and finally, William Bundy's notorious
40-page paper of October 1964, in which he, then the Assistant
Secretary of State for the Far East, suggested that in order to
extricate itself from the tightening involvement in Vietnam, the
United States might essentially provoke ``another Gulf of Tonkin
incident,'' bomb the North in retaliation and then quietly signal
to a third party, perhaps the Secretary General of the United
Nations, that Washington would be pleased to see negotiations on
Vietnam's future reconvene in Geneva. (Bundy called this last his
``Swing wildly at the first one, then bunt'' strategy.) As late as
July 1965, McGeorge Bundy would write to McNamara that the decision
to deploy combat troops was ``rash to the point of folly.''
</P>
<P>
   These sources are well marshaled and they make for good,
sometimes fascinating reading. The central argument, however, is
not new. (Among others, Leslie H. Gelb and Richard K. Betts made
similar arguments in their 1979 study, ``The Irony of Vietnam: The
System Worked.'') And they raise an obvious question: why, if the
outlook for United States involvement looked so grim from the
outset, and the talented officials responsible for making United
States policy recognized it as such, did American leaders go ahead
and commit the country to a war they doubted could be won?
</P>
<P>
   Bird's answer, at least on its face, is simple: domestic
politics. As Kennedy told an aide not long before his death, ``If I
tried to pull out completely now from Vietnam, we would have
another Joe McCarthy scare on our hands, but I can do it after the
election.'' Kennedy's stated intention is of course familiar, and
we will never know whether he would have carried it out. We do see,
however, how the same political worries obsessed Lyndon Johnson.
The thought of sending young Americans to Vietnam ``just sends
chills up my spine,'' he told Senator Richard Russell of Georgia in
1964, in a recently disclosed audiotape of a telephone
conversation, but he feared political retribution even more:
``They'd impeach a President, though, that would run out, wouldn't
they?''
</P>
<P>
   In the near term, certainly, a retreat on Vietnam would have
damaged, if not doomed, Johnson's chances to pass the ambitious
legislation he envisaged at home. Russell, it's worth noting, was a
leader of the so-called Southern Bourbon senators, powerful,
conservative men who tended to control the all-important defense
committee and subcommittees and whom Johnson was forced to cajole
to pass his civil rights legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as Kennedy suggested when he pointed to ``another Joe
McCarthy scare,'' it was not only the Democrats who worried
Johnson. Leading members of the so-called Establishment, in their
concern to head off a return to interwar isolationism and to insure
public support for the role of the United States as a world power,
had pushed forward an ideology that obliged the country to defend
freedom around the globe -- or, as President Truman put it in his
doctrine, ``to support free peoples who are resisting attempted
subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   As a mission, it was unreasonably ambitious; as a domestic
political strategy, its weaknesses were soon apparent. For while
the Truman Doctrine offered a rationale for America's permanent
global role, it also tended to make American leaders responsible
for failures that they could do little to prevent. The prime
exampple -- the ``loss of China'' and the damage it did to the
Democratic Party -- was vividly present during the Vietnam years in
the mind of every Democratic politician.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's determination to have it both ways -- to fight the war
abroad and maintain a liberal agenda at home -- helps account for
some of the more politically damaging decisions he made: for
example, choosing to announce the critical step of sending an
additional 50,000 troops to Vietnam at the end of a routine press
conference on July 28, 1966, and avoiding calling up the National
Guard or even asking Congress to appropriate additional funds.
Taking the latter steps, of course, would have required Johnson to
speak forthrightly about the extent of the American commitment and
to devote his efforts to convincing Americans of its importance.
But it was precisely this that he was unwilling to do.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bird, both Bundys were surprised by the President's
reluctance to acknowledge a step that had been so painfully taken.
Writing of a decision three months before to send in 20,000
marines, Bird says McGeorge Bundy knew the ``introduction of ground
combat troops constituted a new policy. Politically, he thought
this should be publicly acknowledged and explained. But if his
President had decided to send in the troops without any fanfare, he
felt he had no choice but to go along. When asked, Bundy would now
tell the press that the additional marines meant no change in
'existing policy.' '' His brother, asked some years later whether
he thought Johnson had been honest about the troop commitment,
responded that the decision ``was certainly in my judgment at least
as honest as many things that Franklin Roosevelt did in 1941.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-BUNDY-4THTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: in 1941.'') &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The detached tone of these statements reflects a central
difficulty with Bird's argument: the Bundys, for all their
intelligence and glamour, made no real decisions about the war.
They could write papers, debate how many tons of bombs would be
enough to deliver ``the message'' to Hanoi and do so in chillingly
impersonal and technocratic terms. (Bird's account of how the
Bundys and other Johnson officials responded to the vast
bloodletting in Indonesia in 1965 leaves one especially nauseated
by the body-count morality of the cold war.) In the end, however,
it was the President who made the critical decisions.
</P>
<P>
   When Bird argues, as he did in a recent television interview,
that ``Vietnam was born of a failure of liberal courage'' -- and
that ``liberals thought they simply could not stand up and say to
the American people: Look, 'Vietnam is just not worth it,' since
they could not afford to look weak on Communism'' -- he is right
but somewhat irrelevant, at least when it comes to the men he
writes about. They served ``their'' President. For them public
dissent was not an option; institutional loyalty -- duty --
remained all-important. Even the most persistent in-house
dissenter, Deputy Secretary of State George Ball, never spoke out
publicly against the war. As for Bundy, he would later write in an
unfinished manuscript on Vietnam: ``Since on balance I am in favor
of trying harder, not heading for the exit, I am ready to help the
President do it his way; he's the boss. I am for more explanation,
and more Congressional participation. . . . The President knows all
that and prefers his course. I help him. That's an indispensable
part of what the White House staff is for.''
</P>
<P>
   The explanation is typically blithe and self-confident, and the
tone, in its determined reasonableness about a seemingly endless
and intractable war, perfectly maddening to someone like, say, the
younger Bird, sitting impatiently, mesmerized yet appalled, in that
amphitheater in Minnesota. But to read how the elegant and
intensely controlled Bill Bundy, buried under the frustrations and
complexities of Vietnam, begins to scream at his aides -- ``He
threw papers at an associate of mine, someone I knew. He threw
papers the full length of the room; . . . he just screamed'' -- is
to understand how high a cost this self-imposition of duty can
exact.
</P>
<P>
   His brother left for the Ford Foundation in early 1966. As its
president, McGeorge Bundy virtually created public television,
funded Wolfson College at Oxford and headed an ambitious,
presumptuous and ultimately unsuccessful fight to remake the New
York City school system. After leaving Ford, Bundy wrote an
extraordinary book, ``Danger and Survival: Choices About the Bomb
in the First Fifty Years'' (1988), about a subject that had
fascinated him for four decades. He also helped create the
so-called Gang of Four, a group of distinguished former officials,
which also included Robert McNamara, George F. Kennan and Herbert
Scoville, who spoke out on American nuclear policies. Their first
and most important effort was an article in Foreign Affairs in 1983
calling for an end to the United States' policy of first use of
nuclear weapons to stop a Soviet invasion of Europe. Coming from
Bundy and his colleagues, the argument carried real weight, and
though it did not instantly change policy, it did much to set off a
true debate, one that led to a loosening of discussion about
nuclear weapons and probably helped produce, a decade later, the
important Salt 2 treaty.
</P>
<P>
   McGeorge Bundy died on Sept. 16, 1996, concluding one act, at
least, of what Bird calls ``a peculiarly American tragedy.'' It is
unclear, though, where that tragedy lay. In the fact that the Bundy
brothers ``did not even consider the possibility of speaking out
publicly''? What is striking when one considers the shaping of
American foreign policy during the late 1940's and during the
mid-60's is not how differently but how similarly the men of the
so-called Establishment behaved. In both cases, America's leaders
sought to make their arguments ``clearer than truth.'' During the
40's, the rhetorical strategy -- embodied in President Truman's
pledge ``to support free peoples who are resisting attempted
subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures'' -- had
been effective in convincing Americans of the necessity of taking
on a worldwide burden. Twenty years later, deployed before a
different country and in a more ambiguous and murky cause, the
language broke down and the persuasion failed. That McGeorge Bundy,
a man who never lacked for things to say, could do nothing about
this does not rise to the level of tragedy. He did indeed, for his
part, ``screw up Vietnam,'' as he admitted to an importunate
journalist, but he wasn't ``going to spend the rest of my life
feeling guilty about it.'' It was an arrogant thing to say; but it
was classic Bundy.

FCC CHIEF'S LETTER RAISES CONCERN ON MERGER PLANS FOR AMERITECH AND
SBC  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a rare public step, the chairman of the Federal
Communications Commission encouraged the Ameritech Corp. and SBC
Communications Inc. Friday to help draw up terms that would promote
competition so the commission would approve the companies' pending
$62 billion merger.
</P>
<P>
   William E. Kennard, the FCC's chairman, said in a letter to the
chairmen of the two local telephone companies that ``at this stage,
I have serious concerns'' about whether the deal would serve the
public interest. But he gave no indication that he would prefer to
reject the merger outright, a move that many communications experts
continue to consider highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, Kennard seemed to indicate that there was
no way that the commission would approve the deal without
conditions. Referring to the prospect of a drawn-out, adversarial
proceeding about the merger before an administrative law judge _ a
step the commission has not resorted to recently for a major merger
_ Kennard wrote, ``Among the actions which the commission could
take are to set your application for a full hearing or to approve
it with conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennard said the commission's staff wanted assurances that the
merger would not interfere with the companies' ability to open
their networks to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most surprising aspect of yesterday's letter was
that it was made public at all. People close to the commission said
Friday that the FCC traditionally had tried to shield its talks
with companies whose mergers it is considering from the light of
publicity, believing that privacy fosters candor.
</P>
<P>
   But that strategy has opened the commission to criticism in the
past. After the commission approved the 1997 merger of the Bell
Atlantic &UR;  &LR; Corp. and the Nynex Corporation subject to
pro-competition conditions that were negotiated largely in secret,
some of the commission's critics accused the FCC of using the
merger-review process as a tool to advance its regulatory agenda in
ways it could not otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive, perhaps, to those criticisms, Kennard seemed to want
to dispel any perception of the commission's merger-review process
as a mysterious ``black box.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department approved the Ameritech-SBC deal without
conditions last week. Some communications experts in Washington
said last night that it was unlikely that the FCC would sign off on
the merger, with conditions, before late summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an opportunity to put forth the many benefits of this
merger and to address the questions raised by the commission,''
said Lisa Kim, an Ameritech spokeswoman. ``The Justice Department
has found that the merger does not violate the antitrust laws and
we are confident that the FCC will approve this merger as well.''
</P>
<P>
   SBC declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Another merger of phone giants ran into a stiffer rebuke Friday.
Virginia regulators rejected the merger petition of Bell Atlantic
and the GTE Corp., saying the companies did not provide enough
evidence that their deal would not hurt consumers. The companies
now have to provide more information to the regulators.

 &UR; OUT OF THE CLOSET AND INTO THE STREETS
</P>
<P>
   BY STACEY D'ERASMO
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It is a particular feature of being gay or lesbian that politics
and desire are intertwined. ``An army of lovers,'' goes the slogan,
``cannot fail,'' which may or may not be true, but it certainly
makes for a more interesting army. When we march, we cannot pretend
that it is in the service of some disembodied principle: our bodies
are on the line, literally. Since the coming of AIDS, that quality
has only intensified, but long ago, in the days just before and
after the Stonewall uprising in 1969, lesbians and gay men pursued
liberation with the fervor of homesteaders. They built a new world
out of themselves: their bodies, their desires, their flaws.
</P>
<P>
   One such revolutionary was Karla Jay, a more or less nice Jewish
girl from Brooklyn who graduated from Barnard College in 1968.
Though congenially leftist, in 1968 she was more concerned about
starting work on her doctorate; she had had female lovers, but she
had had male ones, too. She lived on the Upper West Side and had
two cats. ``Tales of the Lavender Menace'' is her memoir of the
relatively small slice of time -- 1968 to 1972 -- during which she
was transformed, like a Sapphic Cinderella, from an ordinary
bisexual college girl into a fabulous radical lesbian activist, a
veteran of consciousness-raising, demonstrations, media takeovers,
radical infighting, orgies and a dizzying rate of personal and
social change that evidently entailed having lots and lots of sex.
The doctorate-bound Karla Jayne Berlin who primly hoped, in 1968,
that the Columbia takeover ``would remain an isolated incident''
was by 1970 the self-named Karla Jay, who was planning with several
others to take over an entire California county and turn it into a
gay homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Like plants blooming in time-lapse photography, the legendary
radical feminist and gay liberation groups of the era bud, flower
and fade with tremendous rapidity: the Redstockings, Witch,
Radicalesbians, the Gay Liberation Front. Fully prepared to
overthrow everything on the planet in 1968, they were nearly all
extinct by 1970. Jay's calm descriptions of the often extraordinary
goings-on are duly inspiring, and not infrequently hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   From the feminist Ti-Grace Atkinson, who seriously counseled
celibacy until the revolution arrived, to the vigilant
cross-dresser at the first Gay Pride March in Los Angeles who
``planned to carry a rifle under his skirt,'' Jay and her fellow
travelers rarely met a wild-eyed prophet they didn't like.
Anything, to them, was possible. When Jay meets a man at a march
who is wearing ``nothing but a lacy pair of red underpants'' and
says he's the minister of the Psychedelic Venus Church, which
conducts orgies, her response is to go live with him for a while
and experience his interesting theology. But for her, too, the
utopian impulse passed. By 1972, Jay was back in graduate school,
co-editing (with Allen Young) the now-classic anthology ``Out of
the Closets: Voices of Gay Liberation.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay generally strikes a fair-minded eyewitness-to-history pose,
but her deeper theme is the pleasure and sadness of mutability. She
exuberantly writes that after 1968 ``my former self was gone,
unrecognizable even to me.'' However, in the epilogue she confides
that today she feels ``little connection'' with the freewheeling
person who existed between 1968 and 1971. In flash-forward, we
learn that previously radical companions are now careerists or
crazy or dead. Jay herself is currently a professor of English at
Pace University, whose ``drugs of choice'' are Motrin and caffeine.
</P>
<P>
   The accounts of her rollicking past are thrown into poignant
relief by the book's memorial, recuperative feeling. ``History is
so precarious,'' she writes, ``it could hinge on one careless trip
to the laundry without first checking the contents of the pants
pockets.'' This, then, turns out to be the story of the radical who
saved what she found in her pockets, and wrote it all down.

 &UR; THE POET IN THE GARDEN
</P>
<P>
   BY RICHARD EDER
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1950's, when the Stalinism of Poland's Communist
government began to soften and exit papers became easier, a young
poet named Zbigniew Herbert traveled to France and Italy to visit
such monuments of Western art as Chartres and Amiens cathedrals,
the Lascaux caves, the hill towns of Tuscany and the rich
Renaissance remains across Provence and southwestern France. Armed
with an outdated Baedeker, Herbert was a starving man hurling
himself upon a feast.
</P>
<P>
   A gentle upbringing had been shattered when Herbert was 15 and
the Germans invaded. He spent the war years in the resistance. Then
came the abstract rhetoric of postwar Communism and the
constrictions of its concrete gray reality. It was like the
household of some meanly penitential pastor: all grace and no meal.
For a growing poet the starvation was less in the hunger than in
the grace's dead words.
</P>
<P>
   History shapes our language, and often by the law of unintended
consequences. The iron ideologies of the Soviet Union, along with
the real iron that enforced them, gave rise to a poetry of
extraordinary amplitude. Our own non-ideological amplitude, by
contrast, has tended to narrow poetry down, however accomplished.
``Truth'' and ``Beauty,'' a century and a half after the Romantics,
bear expired shelf-life labels and seem unsalable in our domestic
literary market. But some Russian, Polish and Czechoslovak poets --
in particular Osip Mandelstam and Herbert -- found a special genius
for making all but indistinguishable the line between the sublime
and the homely, the abstract and the material. If their writing is
oddly accessible to translation, perhaps it is owing to their
remarkable ability to name universals by naming particulars. (In
these new Herbert volumes, as in previous ones, John and Bogdana
Carpenter use the gift of plainness to render into English a poet
who was at once plain and polychrome -- notable, as Seamus Heaney
wrote, ``for the extremity and equanimity of his recognitions.'')
</P>
<P>
   Herbert's voracity in launching himself upon France and Italy
was expressed, with an irony that is never far from his passion, in
the title of the essay collection he wrote in the years following
-- ``Barbarian in the Garden.'' After the years of leaden rhetoric,
the voracity was still for ``Truth'' and ``Beauty'' -- but verified
now by the landscape, the architecture, the art, the sun. Older at
30 than many of us are at 50, Herbert also knew the blood that ran
beneath the beauty, and the destructive arrogance that truth
assumes. Heaney again: ``He has seen more broken columns with his
eyes than most literary people have seen in their imaginations.''
Above all (it is the rift out of which his poetry flowed), while
drawn to the soaring of large ideas, he knew how dumb and deadly
they turn when unmoored to the particular.
</P>
<P>
   In the poetry of the decades to follow he would write of
exterminations of all kinds -- of the spirit even more than the
body. He used allegorical satire with whiplash grace; the more
cutting because of its moments of forbearance. The essence of his
poetry, though, is something else: a small phrase with the
expansive radiation of a split atom.
</P>
<P>
   Two collections -- ``Elegy for the Departure'' and ``The King of
the Ants'' -- have been published in translation eight months after
Herbert died, perhaps an artery or two away from a Nobel. ``King of
the Ants'' is 11 prose variations on Greek myths, most of them
speaking out for the underdogs. There is a nice sketch of Atlas
forced to do the drudge work of holding up the heavens. As the gods
-- read the privileged -- would say, ``Someone must do it.'' It is
minor Herbert, on the whole, though the poet's wit and moral bite
are evident.
</P>
<P>
   Much of ``Elegy'' is major Herbert. Its four sections draw
chronologically from his early, middle and late writing. Some of
the short prose pieces in Part 3, written in the 1960's, seem
facile, even whimsical. Here and in several of the earlier poems it
is as if Herbert's cutting instrument were incising a substance
softer than his customary granite. Yet some of the poems written in
the 1950's remain memorable. They call up the rending losses of
war, but even here they do it not head on but by an examination of
small obliterations. Here, to a vanished (dead?) woman:
</P>
<P>
   you left an embrace like a superfluous sweater
</P>
<P>
   a look like a question
</P>
<P>
   our hands won't transmit the shape of your hands
</P>
<P>
   In another poem he depicts children playing, pigeons alighting
on a poet's statue. War comes:
</P>
<P>
   the children on our street
</P>
<P>
   had a difficult death
</P>
<P>
   pigeons fell lightly
</P>
<P>
   like shot down air
</P>
<P>
   That shot-down air: it is not just pigeons that war destroys but
the world.
</P>
<P>
   There are splendid poems in the middle sections; notably a
dialogue between a son and his father at the father's funeral. The
dead father worries about expense, about how the son will manage;
he tells him where money and jewels are squirreled away:
</P>
<P>
   this is how our dead
</P>
<P>
   look after us
</P>
<P>
   they warn us through dreams
</P>
<P>
   bring back lost money
</P>
<P>
   hunt for jobs
</P>
<P>
   whisper the numbers of lottery tickets
</P>
<P>
   or when they can't do this
</P>
<P>
   knock with their fingers on the
</P>
<P>
   windows
</P>
<P>
   The last section, written in the later years, contains some of
Herbert's most spacious work, a welling up of vitality and variety.
There is a tarantella of a poem about Tolstoy fleeing family and
keepers at the end ``with great bounds /
</P>
<P>
   his beard streaming behind.'' There is a somber, perfectly tuned
image of the Emperor Hirohito, history's wildness departed,
laboring over a
</P>
<P>
   tanka about the state railroad. There is the unsparingly
registered loss of ``Prayer of the Old Men'' -- ``when the children
women patient animals have left /
</P>
<P>
   because they can't bear wax hands . . . we listen to sand
pouring in our veins /
</P>
<P>
   and in our dark interior grows a white church /
</P>
<P>
   of salt memories calcium and unspeakable weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   There is the majestic and intimately piercing testament of ``A
Journey,'' its Cavafy-like stoicism enjoining the willingness to
adventure, then to renounce and finally to depart:
</P>
<P>
   the clock stops and from now on hours are black white or blue
</P>
<P>
   they absorb the thought that you lose the lines of your face
</P>
<P>
   what answer can an eroded
</P>
<P>
   inscription give to thistles
</P>
<P>
   give back the empty saddle with no regret
</P>
<P>
   give the air back to another
</P>
<P>
   And there is the precise and expansive ``Elegy for the Departure
of Pen Ink and Lamp,'' in which he recalls the steel pen points of
his childhood:
</P>
<P>
   outlet of the critical mind
</P>
<P>
   messenger of soothing
</P>
<P>
   knowledge . . .
</P>
<P>
   in a box of the storekeeper
</P>
<P>
   you were like a fish waiting
</P>
<P>
   for me
</P>
<P>
   in a school of other fish . . .
</P>
<P>
   I put you respectfully in my mouth
</P>
<P>
   and for a long time felt on my tongue
</P>
<P>
   a taste
</P>
<P>
   of sorrel
</P>
<P>
   and the moon
</P>

 &UR; UNAVOIDABLY DETAINED
</P>
<P>
   BY ELIZABETH HANSOn
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   THE internment of Japanese-Americans after the bombing of Pearl
Harbor has been written about widely, but Americans may not realize
that during the same period the Canadian Government sent more than
20,000 Japanese-Canadians to camps in the eastern sections of
British Columbia and to sugar beet farms in Manitoba and Alberta.
The injustice continued after the war, when internees were given
the choice of settling east of the Rockies or being deported to
war-ravaged Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Kerri Sakamoto's first novel, ``The Electrical Field,''
considers the effect
</P>
<P>
   of the internment and its aftermath through its portrayal of the
life of a middle-aged woman, Asako Saito, who settles in a bleak
suburb of Toronto after leaving the camp where she and her mother,
father and two brothers had been detained.
</P>
<P>
   The story, told by Miss Saito (as she is known to her
neighbors), is set in the 1970's; she lives in an old farmhouse at
the edge of a field filled with huge electrical towers, a
depressing contrast to the lovely coastal town in British Columbia
where she grew up. Miss Saito's mother and older brother have died,
and she spends her days caring for her bedridden father as well as
her younger brother, Stum. Nearby live other nihonjin, or
Japanese-Canadians, including Yano, who is trying to organize the
others to demand redress; his Hiroshima-born wife, Chisako; and a
wild young teen-ager, Sachi, and her mother, Keiko.
</P>
<P>
   As Miss Saito goes about her self-sacrificing daily routine, we
see her struggling with the ``sense I'd carried for as long as I
could remember, that I must look after everyone, as I had all my
life.'' She accepts her duty yet clearly resents it as well; she
must feed and change her father as if he were an infant -- the
father who in his younger days was often drunk and who beat her
beloved elder brother. Miss Saito focuses her maternal urges on
Sachi and even spies on the girl's sexual tumbles with Yano's son,
Tam. Loneliness is Miss Saito's constant companion, and she fears
losing Stum to his girlfriend, who is not nihonjin.
</P>
<P>
   Soon we learn that Chisako has been murdered, along with her
lover, Donaldson Spears. Much is made of the fact that Spears is a
hakujin, or white person, and that in the course of falling in
love, Chisako bloomed in a way that Miss Saito both envies and
fears. When Yano takes his two children and disappears, we are led
into the mystery of where they have gone and who killed Chisako. In
the process, we learn secrets about Miss Saito's past and the truth
about the death of her elder brother.
</P>
<P>
   Sakamoto, a Canadian of Japanese descent, clearly knows the
world Miss Saito inhabits. With virtuosity, she describes domestic
rituals like the washing of rice or the serving of green tea. And
she uses subtle images -- particularly shoes, removed to wlk
through damp grass or left on inside a neighbor's home -- to remind
us of the nuances of many Japanese customs. The characters'
conversations are filled with Japanese words, left unitalicized to
indicate how completely they have been incorporated into the
Japanese-Canadians' English. Sakamoto also conveys well the hatred
and suspicion Miss Saito and her neighbors feel for the white
world, their practice of hiding real feelings behind a cordial
exterior and their submission to the unrelenting force of a sense
of shame.
</P>
<P>
   Reading a novel with a first-person narrator is a bit like
strapping yourself into a seat next to a voluble stranger for a
transcontinental flight. You hope your seatmate has an interesting
story to tell, or at least an interesting way to tell a dull one.
Unfortunately, after spending time with the dour Miss Saito, some
readers might be tempted to put on their headphones and feign
sleep. She is a survivor, but not a plucky one. Her interactions
with the other characters sometimes seem melodramatic, and her
combination of resignation and neediness becomes annoying. Her
story, though suspenseful, can be confusing as well, since the
narrative moves back and forth between distant memories and events
in both the recent past and the present.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of ``The Electrical Field'' lies in its portrayal
of the world Miss Saito inhabits. It is a world in which the
enormous towers marching ``like giants past the houses'' are a
constant reminder of the powerful forces that restrict her -- just
as firmly as the fences of that wartime camp.

 THE KINDNESS OF CHILDREN

 &UR; WHEN THEY WERE GOOD
</P>
<P>
   BY ANN HULBERT
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Learning by doing,'' John Dewey memorably taught Americans, is
children's way. The corollary -- that a teacher's day should be
full of ``doing by learning'' from her busy charges -- is a
progressive lesson that has proved harder to appreciate or to put
into practice. Teachers have nightmares of losing control and
collapsing in exhaustion if they truly let children's inventiveness
shape their curriculums. Principals and parents have visions of
monkeys taking over the zoo. Perhaps the rare teachers who do
manage to make every day at school an unpredictable yet purposeful
adventure in mutual education deserve to boast about it. Certainly
it is these progressive wonders who have written the most, and
often the best, accounts of the hubbub behind the classroom door
and the bureaucrats' abstract rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Vivian Gussin Paley has occupied a secure but comparatively
obscure place among a surprisingly male company of these American
teacher-writers. Herbert Kohl, Jonathan Kozol and Robert Coles,
among others, were earnest idealists who found wisdom among
schoolchildren in the late 1960's and promptly began producing
books about the experience. By now they have won near-guru status
as witnesses to the wisdom of innocence. Paley was busy teaching
then, too, but she didn't begin writing until the late 1970's, and
over the years she has kept a more modest profile. ``The Kindness
of Children,'' as the title reveals, marks her self-conscious bid
to join the inspirational preachers. If the book feels strained,
that only helps to highlight the secret of Paley's previous
success: she is not a moral proselytizer but a born teacher. And as
her earlier books prove, that is the loftier vocation in any case.
</P>
<P>
   Paley's distinctive canvas until now has been smaller in scale
than that of some of her socially crusading brethren. Her titles
convey the stay-at-home instincts of a teacher whose hearth (and
heart) is in her classroom: ``Boys and Girls: Superheroes in the
Doll Corner'' (1984), ``The Boy Who Would Be a Helicopter: The Uses
of Storytelling in the Classroom'' (1990), ``The Girl With the
Brown Crayon: How Children Use Stories to Shape Their Lives''
(1997). Paley's best known book is probably ``You Can't Say You
Can't Play'' (1992), named after the rule she debated with her
students and then posted in her kindergarten class at the
Laboratory School on the campus of the University of Chicago, where
she taught until her recent retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Paley has always known, and often worried, that her wonderful
little classroom is no microcosm of the real world. But she has
also been convinced that she has found a universal domain of
``fantasy and friendship'' in her doll corners, and above all on
the rug that has served as a stage for the ``story playing and
storytelling'' that have ``become the curriculum of any classroom
in which I am the teacher.'' For Paley has been a teacher with a
faith, not a lesson plan: a faith that through the shaping and
sharing of stories comes comprehension for children -- and comfort
and inspiration for them, and for her. ``Children do not pretend to
be storytellers; they are storytellers,'' she has written. ``It is
their intuitive approach to all occasions. It is the way they
think.''
</P>
<P>
   And it has become the way she thinks, too, turning her into a
writer as well as a teacher. Paley's method is to weave intimate
stories about her story-filled classroom. The vignettes that result
are ideally suited to her subject. Her classroom scenes, by
capturing with precision the 3-foot-high child's-eye view, bring
down to earth what risks sounding like a romantically sweeping
credo about salvation through narration. Actual kindergartners
swapping tales makes for more interesting and credible confusion
than that. In Paley's pages, the familiar chatter of childhood
becomes a quilt, scrappy but well sewn together, of journeys into a
world that bewilders but also beckons children to join it.
</P>
<P>
   Paley has long and admirably resisted touting the tales as
therapeutic exercises. Nor does she render pat diagnoses of, say,
the girl who always tells the mother-baby stories, the boy who
specializes in bad guys, much less the boy who is a helicopter all
day long. Her restraint has made her a teacher's writer rather than
a pontificator or a prescriber. Whether she homes in on a troubled
child like Jason the Helicopter, or on a charismatic leader like
Reeny, whose passion for the children's author and artist Leo
Lionni swept up an entire class for a year, Paley peddles no cures
or easy miracles. Her tireless curiosity (she writes down stories,
tapes them, transcribes the tapes and mulls over the results) has
gone hand in hand with humility. ``Clearly,'' she concedes on
plenty of days, ``we do not understand most of what motivates the
children.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Kindness of Children,'' however, Paley has succumbed to
the temptation to hold forth as ``something besides a
schoolteacher,'' and has taken a spiritual rather than a clinical
turn. She borrows her epigraph from Rabbi Yehuda Nisiah -- ``The
moral universe rests upon the breath of schoolchildren'' -- and
proposes a kinship between her reliance on storytelling and the
Hasidic tradition of inspiring virtue by spreading tales of holy
men ``performing mitzvot, good deeds.'' She herself professes
surprise at her impulse to stray from ``the secular classroom'' and
its language, wondering, ``Have I moved to a new place where
Scripture motivates the discourse?'' But as that slightly arch
question suggests, she is not displeased by her new grandiosity.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what Paley is really peddling is a kind of self-help
simplicity -- an ``All You Need to Know You Learned in
Kindergarten'' with a progressive education. In place of Robert
Fulghum's hokey, heartwarming ``notions,'' as he calls his parables
about ordinary life, she has packaged together soul-strengthening
tales from unusual classrooms. Gone are the daily minutiae, the
jostle of small bodies and distinctive personalities that helped
show how stories can work to draw a class together and lead
children out of loneliness, not forever but for part of a day.
(When the Girl Who Would Be a Mommy gets Jason to forget his
whirring blades and be her baby, the drama is more stirring for
happening so quietly amid the daily commotion.) In ``The Kindness
of Children'' Paley instead showcases a collection of much more
polished gems about children's ``spontaneous acts of goodness,''
which she has gathered and retold as she goes about her emeritus
career of lecturing and visiting schools.
</P>
<P>
   The tales in themselves are often quite moving -- the paraplegic
boy radiant at being included in a pretend game of ``store''; the
tough boy who whispers saving advice to a child on the brink of
collapse; the girl who is suddenly overwhelmed with a feeling of
generosity on a crowded bus. But Paley's insistence on the
momentous significance of being deeply moved by the tales, as she
claims her audiences are, can't help make the scenes of story
sharing seem stagy and self-congratulatory. Where once she crouched
and listened on the rug, now she soars to the clouds, proclaiming
one cooperative moment ``a great and mysterious event,'' another
instant of bonding ``a work of art.'' Her mission, she now
discovers, is God's: ``To give someone a role to play -- a lost
baby, the suffering mother, the virtuous sibling -- is akin to
offering new life to a wandering soul. If this feels like a
spiritual moment, why not call it that?''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Paley briefly senses that she has perhaps failed
to appreciate the potential for facile uplift in her endeavor. ``It
does not occur to me that this new role I've given myself proceeds
too smoothly. No longer am I tested each day as I was in the
classroom. There it was quite impossible to cover my mistakes;
here, upon this podium, the illusion of virtue comes easily.'' Her
zeal for ``good'' stories has meant that she skirts over dark ones,
she realizes with discomfort as an audience of adults recounts
memory after memory of childhood cruelty.
</P>
<P>
   But she is rescued from this confrontation with the limits of
her inspirational morality by a surge of sentimentality. ``The rock
upon which the moral universe depends'' is to be found in
children's narrative play, Paley declares, exulting that ``these
spontaneous storytellers create little homes for one another where
everyone can imagine playing a role and no one is left out.'' Yet
children are also ``passionately pedantic literalists,'' as Lionel
Trilling once pointed out. By kindergarten they have already
discovered that conquering fears and finding true companionship
rarely follow the storybook course they act out on the rug. They
have told their teacher that, and much more, over the years, and
she always listened -- until her turn came to do most of the
talking.

 MONICA'S STORY

 &UR; THAT WOMAN
</P>
<P>
   BY MICHAel Oreskes
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For those who argue that American culture is collapsing in on
itself, hollowed out by self-indulgence and narcissism, ``Monica's
Story'' will be an original source document. To say that the basic
plot is now familiar, overly familiar, would be, to quote Barbara
Walters in a related context, the understatement of the year. But
in this fairy tale retelling by Andrew Morton, whose best-known
previous Lifetime Channel treatment was the biography of Diana,
Princess of Wales, one factor emerges: the complete absence of
grown-ups.
</P>
<P>
   No one, not Monica, not her dueling parents or her enabling
aunt, and certainly not the president of the United States, ever
says no and means it. The words ``self-worth'' and ``self-esteem''
are sprinkled through this text. But no one seems to talk about
responsibility or consequences or discipline until Monica looks
back at the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not blaming him for what happened,'' she says of her
boyfriend-in-chief, ``but it was just too much. It was too much of
an emotional burden for someone my age. If I had really understood
everything I would have seen him more as a president than a man,
and I would have realized the ramifications of ever telling anybody
about it.'' Remarkably, she still doesn't regret kissing, only
telling Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   For those who were hoping we would learn something new, not just
about Monica but about Bill Clinton, there are only teases here. If
you followed this saga as a soap opera, as I did, there are few
fresh details, and none you won't have read about already. If you
followed it as a constitutional crisis (I'm enough of a
compartmentalizer to include myself here, too), the insights are
mostly obvious, or wrong. For all the ink that has been spilled in
the past year, there is still reason to want to read a book-length
treatment by someone with direct access to the participants. The
story has left us with some substantial questions unresolved, and I
do not just mean why she didn't destroy the dress (she kept it,
uncleaned, in large part out of a characteristic slovenliness,
Morton argues).
</P>
<P>
   For a generation now, politicians and journalists have been
wrestling with how to measure and describe the importance of
something called character in choosing a leader and what role, if
any, private behavior has in predicting public conduct. Jack
Kennedy was lionized, but Ted Kennedy and Gary Hart were judged
unfit for the top office. The country ``knew'' who Bill Clinton was
in some subliminal way. But is the lesson of the Lewinsky matter
that more attention should have been paid to the state of his
marriage and his treatment of women? Or, in effect, is that exactly
the proposition that the country after a year of torment has
rejected? This is an important subject, and a pressing one, as Al
Gore, George W. Bush and the rest ready their runs to succeed
Clinton. What questions should be asked, what standards applied to
these men, and women, who would be president?
</P>
<P>
   There were warning signs with Clinton, and he proved utterly
reckless. But while he was a reckless man, to borrow Monica
Lewinsky's distinction, he has been a highly cautious and
relatively conservative president, to the repeated frustration of
the Democratic Party's traditional base. So perhaps his private
character tells us little of his public life.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, his manifest disability with the truth is
noted by Monica here just as it has been noted in his public life.
She is far from the only one to feel betrayed at some point or
other: Democrats saved Clinton for their own good, and perhaps for
the country's, not because they like or trust him.
</P>
<P>
   Long before we had ever heard of Monica S. Lewinsky, Mario M.
Cuomo, a character study in his own right, told me that Clinton's
inability to resist women was a reflection of a core weakness that
could be seen in many aspects of his life. My own encounters have
left the impression of a politician more interested in winning a
visitor's smile than respect for raising a tough issue between
them. ``He reminded me of my mom,'' Lewinsky says of Clinton,
``because like her, he was an ostrich, putting his head in the sand
because he didn't like confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   The absence of adult supervision does not seem to be quite the
point Morton set out to make when he takes us through Monica's
growing up in Beverly Hills. She was a willful 2-year-old. But most
2-year-olds are willful. What is striking is how she always got
what she wanted. No, Monica, the reader wants to scream, you cannot
stay in the swing after dark. No, Monica, you cannot cut the
sleeves off that dress. No, Monica, you cannot cavort with the
president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, an oncologist, appears as the self-acknowledged Dr.
No who tries to insist that Monica have a modest, religiously
appropriate bat mitzvah instead of a Beverly Hills extravaganza.
But her mother takes Monica's side, the extravaganza is held, and
soon thereafter her father has an affair with his nurse and leaves
the scene, only to reappear after the scandal breaks as what Monica
calls her ``rock of Gibraltar.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton's neo-Hegelian view suggests that history is shaped by
eating disorders. This was the case for both Diana and Monica, he
notes (although not as far as we know for another of his subjects,
Daniel arap Moi, the president of Kenya for two decades now). And
he reports an exchange in which Clinton seems to pour out his inner
pain over having been a pudgy kid. ``Monica came to know the man
behind the public mask, a flawed figure riddled with doubt and
wrestling with guilt, yet emotionally needy, vulnerable and
ultimately alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps she did, but we really don't. Despite her privileged
perch, Monica via Morton offers us little new insight into this
contradictory figure. For someone so infatuated by a president, she
seems utterly naive and generally uninterested in the work of
government. Matters of state pass in the background, important only
for how they affect her ability to see or talk on the telephone to
Handsome. She stops for not a sentence to ponder that the budget
collision and ensuing Government shutdown, which created the
opportunity for their first tryst, was also the start of Clinton's
political revival.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of an American soldier in Bosnia comes across in
Morton's retelling as grist for an emotive come-on line: '' 'You
have no idea what a gift it is to me to get to spend time with you
and talk to you,' he told her. 'I cherish that time we spend
together. It's very lonely here and people don't really understand
that.' Misty-eyed with emotion, and with the news of the American
soldier's death fresh in his mind, he went on to tell her about the
difficult decisions he had to make. 'I've been sick about it,' he
said. 'It's really hard to know that someone died because of your
executive order.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Morton seems not to have thought very deeply about the meanings
of his story. He takes a variety of broad and not very
discriminating swipes at ``the mass media'' when what is really
interesting are the fault lines and schisms that this past year has
revealed. He condemns Kenneth Starr repeatedly and judges George
Orwell right: ``The story of the intern and the president
illustrates how easily the modern high-tech state can dissect and
destroy not only individuals, but the basic building block of
society, the family.'' Setting aside Monica's own disregard for
Clinton's family, the threat from an overzealous prosecutor
predates the Internet age (see: Hugo, Victor, Novelist). The more
interesting thought to have emerged from this past year is not, as
Morton argues, that Orwell was right but that Aldous Huxley was
right. The real danger is not from the concentrated power of the
state but from the diffusion of media voices so cacophonous and
filled with trivia that they drown out everything more important
for a civil society to function.
</P>
<P>
   Morton's portrait of Monica's life inside the media frenzy has
moments of fascination. She sits obsessively in front of her
television watching her own life and love affair dissected,
discussed and debated. The woman who formed her image of family
life from ``The Brady Bunch'' honed her legal thinking by watching
``Burden of Proof.'' At one point, incognito, she takes a cousin on
a sightseeing tour of Venice Beach, Calif. A woman walks up to her
and says, ``You look just like Monica Lewinsky, only thinner.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is clearly a rush job, thus a testament to modern
culture. Getting it out quickly, to capture the lucrative but
perhaps fleeting moment, produced many errors, both typographical
and substantive. Henry Hyde, for example, is not a senator and Newt
Gingrich was not a member of the Judiciary Committee. Monica
Lewinsky and the people around her made a lot of bad judgments. But
when they released this book they distributed it to bookstores
before letting reviewers have it. That meant some reviews,
including this one, did not appear until the book had been on sale
for weeks. That was smart.
</P>
<P>
   There is still an important book to be written by someone with
political insight into what this past year teaches us about the
connection between character and leadership. Perhaps it was unfair
to think this might have been that book. If she's not running for
the Senate, maybe Hillary Rodham Clinton will write it for us.

for Sunday, April 4, will move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kosovo-related stories &LR;  (Moving in the `i' category):
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-ORTHODOX-REVIEW (Undated) _ The NATO attack on Serbia has
provoked strong opposition from many Eastern Orthodox Christians
and nations, raising the question whether there is in fact an
`Orthodox world' in the East that differs fundamentally from the
West in its values and principles, that perceives the NATO attacks
not as a moral crusade against a clear evil, but as a hypocritical
Western assault against an Eastern Orthodox nation. By Serge
Schmemann. (on the section dress page)
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-POWELL-REVIEW (Washington) _ The Powell Doctrine was a
strict and cautious policy _ espoused by Gen. Colin Powell when he
was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff _ holding that the U.S.
should intervene militarily only when its vital interests are at
stake, only with decisive force, and only when there is a clear
goal and a defined strategy for getting out. After the 1991 Gulf
war, this idea was discarded as a post-Vietnam relic unsuited to
today's world. But the debacle in Kosovo is suddenly making
Powell's principles look more attractive. By Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-HITECH-REVIEW (Undated) _ Slobodan Milosevic must be
laughing at U.S. threats to use high technology to hold him
accountable. Three years after the U.S. vowed to uncover evidence
of mass executions at Srebrenica, it seems clear that there are
limits to U.S. technology and that technology can be rendered
superfluous if it is used to mask a lack of political will. By
David Rohde.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-BALKANS-OUTLOOK-REVIEW _ Early summary: some
prognistications on what the Balkan region may be like two or three
years from now. By Roger Cohen. (on the section dress page)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Other stories &LR;  (Moving in the `a' category):
</P>
<P>
   COMMUNITY-POLICING-REVIEW (Undated) _ New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani has ostentatiously rejected proposals to implement
community policing, deriding such programs as turning police
officers into social workers. But, perhaps to Giuliani's surprise,
community policing is alive and working successfully in many
cities, from Chicago to San Diego and from Fort Wayne to Fort
Worth. By Fox Butterfield. (on the section dress page)
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER-PRIVACY-REVIEW (San Francisco) _ Hidden in the
Microsoft Word document that carried the Melissa virus around the
world was an innocuous serial number that may help identify the
computer with which the program was written. It is a powerful
illustration of how technology has growing power for promoting both
good and evil, and is the heart of arguments over tradeoffs between
individual privacy rights and the common good. By John Markoff.
</P>
<P>
   SOCSEC-MEDICARE-REVIEW (Washington) _ The trustees report'
extending the projected solvency of Social Security and Medicare by
a few years was political manna for Congress. It made the problem
seem less urgent and provided an excuse for postponing tough
decisions until after the next elections. But demographic data
buried in the trustees' report illustrated why the matter cannot be
put off indefinitely. By David E. Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   BBO-MCGWIRE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Mark McGwire's eyes lit up.
Expecting another `Can you hit 70 home runs again?'
question-and-answer fest, the St. Louis slugger was treated to the
first-ever reverse interview: He got to put questions to other
people, for a change. By Alan Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   DEPORT-VETERANS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Recent laws requiring the
deportation of resident aliens for minor offenses are being
challenged by supporters of several U.S. military veterans who face
expulsion under the law. Through legal challenges and a publicity
campaign on behalf of the veterans (at least one of who is disabled
due to combat wounds) the law's opponents are targeting what they
hope will prove to be its Achilles' heel: its extreme
inflexibility. By Mirta Ojita.
</P>
<P>
   SATIRICAL-WEBSITES-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at Web sites that
make fun of companies. The sites allow disgruntled consumers to
express themselves. The target companies don't seem to see the
humor in this, so they're fighting back with their most familiar
weapon: money. By Timothy L. O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   BIBLE-BOOKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The publishing industry _ no
stranger to overstatement _ has for a long time been cranking out
multitudes of `bibles' on popular subjects _ the Barbecue Bible,
the Bartender's Bible, etc.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ The confusion over the definition of
a blue moon, and some other highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-LANGUAGE-REVIEW (Tokyo) _ Many middle-aged and elderly
Japanese must struggle through what seems like an endless language
school. In restaurants, in stores, in newspapers, on TV and in
conversation with young people, they find themselves bewildered by
what seems like an explosion of English and other foreign-language
terms. By Nicholas D. Kristof.

 &UR; GEEK LORE
</P>
<P>
   BY DAVID POGUE
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Why is Apple Computer such catnip to writers? After all, Apple
is neither the most successful high-tech institution nor the least,
neither the largest nor the smallest. Nonetheless, books pour
forth, retelling the legends of Apple's origins and its business
blunders.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of these three books, in fact, explore Apple from
such drastically different perspectives that they resemble the
blind men encountering an elephant; only when their descriptions
are taken together do they begin to create something of a complete
picture of their challenging subject.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous Apple legend tells of young Steven P. Jobs's
1979 visit to a Xerox installation known as the Palo Alto Research
Center (PARC). There he saw prototypes of then revolutionary, now
standard computer features: the laser printer, Ethernet networking,
E-mail and a graphical interface with mouse, windows and pull-down
menus. So inspired was Jobs, the story goes, that he stole the
ideas, rushed back to Apple and invented the Macintosh. Computers
were never the same.
</P>
<P>
   The real story is a good deal more complicated -- and more
interesting. Michael Hiltzik's long, overly detailed but ultimately
rewarding new book, ``Dealers of Lightning,'' tells the amazing
tale of Xerox PARC itself, from its founding in 1970 to the fateful
day of Jobs's visit.
</P>
<P>
   At first, it's a joyous ride; Hiltzik, a reporter for The Los
Angeles Times, superbly documents the arrival of each brilliant
geek in Palo Alto. These young men quickly discover the highs of
working among fellow geniuses when the dreams are big and the funds
are lavish.
</P>
<P>
   As the team makes one technological vision after another come
true, however, it discovers that its corporate parent back east
isn't the least bit interested in marketing the work. ``Xerox's top
executives were for the most part salesmen of copy machines,''
Hiltzik explains. ``The customer paid Xerox so many cents per
page.'' In the electronic office envisioned by PARC, management
couldn't see where the money would come from. ``If there is no
paper to be copied, where's the 'click'?''
</P>
<P>
   That mentality becomes increasingly frustrating to the team --
and to the reader. It's almost agonizing to contemplate the missed
opportunities Hiltzik describes; Xerox could easily have become the
Microsoft of the era.
</P>
<P>
   The delicious highlight of ``Dealers of Lightning'' recounts
Jobs's famous tour. Contrary to legend, the members of the PARC
team were well aware of the stakes. In fact, they made the Apple
team wait for three hours as, tearful and angry, they debated
showing their secret technologies. But having been promised shares
in Apple's hotly anticipated stock offering, a Xerox executive
forced the issue by phone. Jobs got his demo, folded what he'd seen
into new Apple computers and set off an exodus of PARC employees
that marked the end of the research center's heyday.
</P>
<P>
   Hiltzik's writing is confident and strong, qualities rarely
found in such Silicon Valley tales. But when tackling technical
subjects, he is overly fond of simile, at one point invoking a
disco ball, a lighthouse, singing cats and a wobbly tape deck in a
single discussion. He also ends each chapter with a
contrived-sounding cliffhanger, in a story that needs no such
artificial support. Still, for any student of business or
technology, ``Dealers of Lightning'' offers a gem of a story that
has never before been so well told.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's own story, on the other hand, has often been recounted
-- but never with such hyperbole, anger and profanity as in
``Infinite Loop,'' Michael S. Malone's searing indictment of Steve
Jobs and almost everyone else in Silicon Valley. Malone calls the
co-founder of Apple, Stephen Wozniak, ``socially retarded''; a
former Apple chief financial officer is ``a fat woman executive''
who's ``manic to the point of hysteria''; and Gilbert F. Amelio, a
former Apple chief executive, looks ``like a high school shop
teacher'' and drives a ``pimpy Cadillac Seville.'' Whether the
epithets are intended to be funny or to shock, it's impossible to
say, but the meanness quickly becomes tiresome.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, the editor of Forbes ASAP, reserves his most caustic
remarks for Jobs, with whom he attended elementary school. He
asserts that by the age of 19, Jobs had been ``involved in numerous
felonies'' and was a drug user, bulimic, liar and cheat -- and went
downhill from there. As the head of Apple, Malone says, Jobs was
``a lunatic megalomaniac,'' ``an executive horror and spoiled
brat'' who was ``smelly,'' ``paranoid,'' ``vicious and
belittling.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Malone's research fails to redeem the exaggerated
characterizations. The book teems with technical inaccuracies: the
author confuses memory with disk space, often refers to chip and
computer models that never existed and, most embarrassing,
repeatedly asserts that Apple's Macintosh can't perform simple
multi-tasking.
</P>
<P>
   The factual gaffes, meanwhile, cripple the book's credibility.
For example, Malone condemns Jobs for making a historic 1997
agreement with Microsoft, in which Apple would receive $150 million
-- ``only money, not the crucial quid pro quo in software.'' But in
fact, Microsoft's bigger concession was indeed a promise to develop
Macintosh software until at least 2002, guaranteeing Apple's
legitimacy for five years or more.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, events have not been kind to Malone's promise
to tell of ``the company's destruction.'' Apple has staged a
remarkable comeback since Jobs's return in 1997. Profits, market
share and stock price have steadily surged; by the end of 1998, its
iMac was the best-selling computer in America. But having made a
book-length assertion that ``Apple is already dead,'' Malone has
written himself into a corner. He's forced to dismiss the
spectacular turnaround, declaring it only ``a temporary pause in
Apple's long-term decline.'' But that isn't the only bewildering
remark in this sloppy, only occasionally entertaining work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apple Confidential,'' by contrast, is a cheery, nerdy little
book. It, too, aims to tell the story of Apple's rise, fall and
recent renewal. But this time, the narrative covers only a portion
of each page. The fat margins contain a three-ring circus of visual
elements: time lines, graphs, software Easter eggs, famous ads,
jokes, trivia, photographs and hilarious quotations. They include a
shot of the garage where Jobs and Wozniak invented the Apple
computer; the text of the first E-mail sent from space (a Macintosh
did the sending); and the designers' signatures as they adorned the
inside of early Macintosh cases.
</P>
<P>
   The Apple story itself is here in all its drama: the burned-out
employees, the millions spent on projects that never saw daylight,
the chain of weak C.E.O.'s and their ``reign of error.'' But Owen
W. Linzmayer, a columnist for MacAddict magazine, is more bemused
than disgusted by the whole affair. He understands that life in the
valley (especially at Apple) will always be a soap opera, making
this rendition of the story both more plausible and more fun than
``Infinite Loop.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, ``Apple Confidential'' isn't in the same league --
deeply researched, formal, analytical -- as the two other books.
Its chapters are organized by topic, not chronology, resulting in
frequent repetition of material. The chapter titles are cloying
(one is ``Big Bad Blunders''). And the conceit of dressing up every
page with marginalia sometimes overwhelms the author; very similar
photographs appear two and three times.
</P>
<P>
   But this one isn't a business book; it's written by a technology
lover, for technology lovers. Its real topic is the culture, the
sense of discovery and the addictive rush that great computers
create. In the end, those intangibles finally explain what drove
the scientists at Xerox PARC -- and why Apple the elephant somehow
manages to keep stumbling forward, despite the darts of its
critics.

 &UR; POETIC JUSTICE
</P>
<P>
   BY MELANIE REHAK
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Poets, by nature, are incapable of living the unexamined life.
No detail is too small, no sound in the night too muffled, to
register. From this gradual accumulation of minutiae, this keen
awareness, poems emerge. That such gathering should be evident in
W. S. Merwin's latest contribution to his enormous body of work is
no surprise -- he's had a great deal of practice, not to mention
success, over the past five decades. Beginning with the Yale
Younger Poets Award in 1952, Merwin has received almost every
poetic honor available in this country and has published dozens of
books of poetry, prose and translations. But despite his post at
the Academy of American Poets and his stewardship of the Yale
Younger Poets competition, he remains largely apart from public
literary life. Instead, he lives in Hawaii, far from the fray. He
tends his garden of native palm trees, and he listens.
</P>
<P>
   What he hears, however, has changed in timbre, if not in tone,
over the years. Even as a young man, Merwin wrote poems in the
elegiac mode. He communicated, in book after book, a sense of the
ordinary grieving that accompanies daily life -- missed
opportunities, fiery political and personal defeats (he opposed the
Vietnam War and has long been an environmentalist), the frustration
of failing to capture a poem that deigned to show a glimpse of
itself: ``Coming late, as always, /
</P>
<P>
   I try to remember what I almost heard,'' Merwin wrote in his
1963 collection, ``The Moving Target.'' All this was backlit by a
greater kind of agony, a haunted quality brought on by a history of
deaths in the family, starting with Merwin's maternal grandparents,
who died early, leaving Merwin's mother an orphan, and a brother
who was born and died before Merwin's own birth in 1927. He
wrestled with these ghosts; at times they dragged him away from the
present with which he was so urgently involved.
</P>
<P>
   But age brings with it a desire to review one's life and,
perhaps more important, to make sense of it. Now that Merwin has
reached his early 70's, the long-gone family members have settled,
for the most part, into a larger continuum of ancient voices.
They're just one part of a past that reaches back over eras and
that Merwin unravels in ``Testimony,'' the cornerstone of ``The
River Sound.'' The poem is part history of loss, part last will and
testament. At the outset, the poet is rightly concerned about the
wisdom of his undertaking: ``I am not certain as to how /
</P>
<P>
   the pain of learning what is lost /
</P>
<P>
   is transformed into light at last.'' But nonetheless he attempts
precisely this transformation, laying out narratives of his
childhood, his parents' lives and deaths, his grandparents' deaths
and his older brother's few short minutes on earth. Then he holds
forth on his current marriage and the subsequent happiness of his
later years.
</P>
<P>
   When the poem, which runs nearly 60 pages, isn't telling a
story, it offers up observations -- much like those found in many
of the book's short poems -- on the arbitrary nature of language
and on the vastness of the time-space continuum, and it provides
reports from the existential front, such as
</P>
<P>
   we see the comet
</P>
<P>
   in the northwest as the stars come
</P>
<P>
   saying the name we have for it
</P>
<P>
   now which is nothing like its name
</P>
<P>
   in lost languages
</P>
<P>
   and ``under this roof I listened to /
</P>
<P>
   the singing of their ancestors /
</P>
<P>
   forbears these voices never knew.'' Merwin takes his time
considering the dead and the living, and he devotes extra space to
his wife, whom he adores and with whom he marvels at
</P>
<P>
   the way our days together
</P>
<P>
   suddenly are there behind us
</P>
<P>
   ours still but somewhere else before
</P>
<P>
   we believed they were leaving us
</P>
<P>
   or understood how they could go
</P>
<P>
   like that.
</P>
<P>
   When he eventually gets around to bequeathing things --
particular moments and qualities of light on certain street corners
-- to various friends and relatives, there isn't much he's left
out, and probably a lot he could have. The family chronicles are
evocative, and it's clear that the poem serves a cathartic purpose
for its author. But the endless amazement at the universe wears a
bit thin; by revisiting his awe so frequently, Merwin lessens it
somewhat for his readers.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, ``Testimony'' is moving in its earnestness and in
the scope of its endeavor. It is especially affecting when
considered alongside another poem here, ``Lament for the Makers.''
Where ``Testimony'' deals with family, ``Lament for the Makers''
gives credence to the burden that every poet carries, the
responsibility of being part of another kind of history. There are
memories to be kept alive, and Merwin does his duty with love.
Dylan Thomas, Sylvia Plath, Louis MacNeice, W. H. Auden, Robert
Lowell, Howard Nemerov and Elizabeth Bishop, among others, step
forth to be acknowledged, or just step forth. These are the poets
Merwin grew up with, in a sense, many of whom departed early. ``One
by one they have all gone,'' he writes,
</P>
<P>
   out of the time and language we
</P>
<P>
   had in common which have brought me
</P>
<P>
   to this season after them
</P>
<P>
   the best words did not keep them from
</P>
<P>
   leaving themselves finally
</P>
<P>
   as this day is going from me.
</P>
<P>
   And neither will the best words keep Merwin from leaving,
something he seems to know quite well. Much of ``The River Sound''
is given over to worrying about the failure of words -- so much so
that at times it's tempting to skip ahead and see if he comes up
with any answers. Perhaps it's that Merwin wants to settle the old
debts to confusion and ignorance that we all have before it's too
late. But really, he's performing what James Merrill knew was the
most important task of all, taking care of the ``need to make some
kind of house /
</P>
<P>
   Out of the life lived, out of the love spent.''

 &UR; BUT WILL IT WORK?
</P>
<P>
   BY ALAN RYAN
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, pragmatism was dead beyond all hope of
resurrection. Pragmatism, that is, in the sense of the
philosophical movement associated with C. S. Peirce, William James
and John Dewey, rather than the frame of mind associated with car
salesmen and local politicians. What had killed it was not much in
doubt. On the one hand, philosophy had become a tough, technically
complicated subject whose practitioners thought badly of the
informal musings of Dewey and the exuberant essays of James; on the
other hand, readers who wanted to brood on the meaning of life and
death were more attracted to the angst of existentialism than to
the modest optimism of the pragmatists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Revival of Pragmatism'' is a substantial collection of
essays by some of the most distinguished philosophers, legal
theorists, cultural historians and literary critics writing today,
including Richard Rorty and Hilary Putnam, Judge Richard Posner,
Stanley Fish, Richard Poirier and Ross Posnock. Agreeably enough,
they remain true to pragmatism's earliest years by being of more
than one mind about whether there is a revival, and far from agreed
about just what it might be a revival of. C. S. Peirce's reaction
to William James's coinage of ``pragmatism'' a century ago was to
rename his own philosophy ``pragmaticism.'' The usage did not
stick, but the gesture is famous, and has evidently stuck in the
minds of the essayists here.
</P>
<P>
   Pragmatism was, strictly, a philosophical theory about truth; it
held that what William James breezily called ``the cash value'' of
a statement was a matter of its payoff in action. Truth was what
worked. It was this thought that gave pragmatism its reputation as
a very American form of philosophy. It also gave rise to endless
misconceptions -- such as the complaint that we are entitled to
believe anything that makes us feel good, or that we need only to
believe something firmly enough for it to be as good as true.
William James's pragmatism and Norman Vincent Peale's emphasis on
the power of positive thinking struck many British commentators as
much too close for comfort.
</P>
<P>
   What pragmatism involves in addition to a theory of truth is
debatable. About his wonderful book ``Art and Experience,'' Dewey
once said that it did not provide a pragmatist account of art
because pragmatism was a theory of truth and art lay outside its
subject matter. Nobody has ever taken any notice of his disclaimer,
any more than anyone took any notice of Peirce's. Indeed, the
recent and rather astonishing revival of interest in Dewey has owed
little to his views on truth but a great deal to his views on
community, democracy and religion. Although Rorty has done more
than anyone to locate the American pragmatists in the same
landscape as European post-modernism, the receptivity of his
audience to these heresies owes a lot to a general boredom with
analytical philosophy and a new interest in American cultural
critics of the early 20th century like Randolph Bourne, Horace
Kallen, Lewis Mumford and W. E. B. Du Bois.
</P>
<P>
   The contributors to ``The Revival of Pragmatism'' divide along
some familiar lines. Rorty says that we should see pragmatism as a
form of ``romantic polytheism.'' Rorty's longstanding distaste for
philosophers who unproductively go on and on about whether what we
believe is really true has a predictable result here. The romantic
polytheist does not believe that there really are innumerable gods
to be worshiped and obeyed. Rather the polytheist has bought
Dewey's thought that ``God'' is a plausible name for whatever we
most mind about. The cash value of ``romantic polytheism'' turns
out to be the politics of John Stuart Mill's essay ``On Liberty,''
and a reminder that in the spirit of Mill or Isaiah Berlin we may
each pursue our own intimations of truth, beauty and goodness so
long as we do not interfere with other people's pursuit of their
intimations. Rorty's critics in this volume continue to say, quite
rightly, that Dewey would have thought this altogether too
individualistic and privatized as an ideal of life, and verging on
the undemocratic. They do not add, but I suspect it is true, that
Mill would have done so too.
</P>
<P>
   Posner offers a different perspective; his conception of
pragmatism owes as much to the everyday understanding of the word
as to anything more philosophically strenuous. But his essay is a
very readable, and indeed a rather elegant, discussion of the ways
an appellate judge goes about deciding what the law requires. Just
as Richard Rorty provides us with John Dewey rather dramatically
loosened up, so Judge Posner provides us with something like
Benjamin Cardozo in his shirtsleeves.
</P>
<P>
   Cardozo's famous lectures on ``The Nature of the Judicial
Process,'' delivered in 1921, were something of a pragmatist
landmark, though Cardozo himself was no pragmatist. Cardozo allowed
his hearers into a secret -- judges do not read what the law
requires from some scroll or parchment to which they alone have
access. Some try to make whatever they decide fit as closely as
possible to what their predecessors have decided; others try to
work out what a sensible set of rules would look like, all things
considered, and try to graft it onto what they already possess.
</P>
<P>
   Posner says some cogent and humane things about what this second
approach might mean in practice -- particularly that ``the
pragmatic judge does not think that he should throw up his hands
and say 'sorry no law to apply' when he is confronted with
outrageous conduct that the framers of the Constitution neglected
to foresee and make specific provision for.'' So the law forbidding
married couples to use contraceptives should have been struck down
long before Griswold v. Connecticut, and a Supreme Court with
Richard Posner among the Justices would use the prohibition on
cruel and unusual punishment to stop states sending ``a 16-year-old
to life imprisonment for the sale of one marijuana cigarette'' --
which the present Supreme Court conceivably might allow.
</P>
<P>
   Among the pleasures of the volume are some essays that stray
outside the usual fare of philosophy, law and political theory. Ray
Carney's account of the paintings of Thomas Eakins is perhaps the
farthest removed from the work of the philosophers and lawyers, and
it is certainly the most self-conscious about going back into the
19th century rather than promoting pragmatism as a branch of
late-20th-century avant- gardism. But Carney takes off from one of
Dewey's pregnant remarks in ``Art as Experience'' -- that ``mind is
primarily a verb'' -- and Eakins's paintings of the surgeon at work
in ``The Surgical Clinic of Professor Gross'' and ``The Clinic of
Professor Agnew'' provide him with just the platform he needs.
</P>
<P>
   For Eakins was a strenuous painter; even the dying -- or dead --
Christ in his ``Crucifixion'' (1880) is evidently caught just after
the violence of his execution has been accomplished, and, as Carney
says, the languid, almost elegant body of Christ contrasts with the
savage and jagged scrawl of the mocking inscription above his head.
And in the two, in their way quite alarming, paintings of the
surgeon in midlecture to his students, a similar contrast appears
between the attentive wielder of the knife and the half-attentive
audience -- as if what the mind is is the body paying attention to
what it is doing and seeing. It is, as Ray Carney notes, an apt
illustration of a pragmatist theme. Just as pragmatists repudiated
any idea that truth was a matter of our minds picturing the way the
world really is, so they repudiated any idea that mind was other
than an aspect of our bodily selves. So do we all when we are not
led astray by philosophers.

 THE RISE AND FALL OF THE HOUSE OF BARNEYS

<P>
   BY JENNIFER STEINHAUER
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   There are three kinds of people who might find a book about
Barneys New York, the store that began as a men's discount suit
outlet and eventually grew to serve cafe society, a ``must read.''
The first kind is the fashionistas themselves, who might revel in a
comprehensive chronicle of, for instance, how the designer Azzedine
Alaia decided which stores he wanted to sell his trendy goods to in
the 1980's. Then there are those who are truly interested in the
retail industry and all its corporate finance and marketing
trickery. Finally, there are the six or seven people who are dying
for a heaping dish of dirt on Gene Pressman, one of the two
grandsons of the store's founder, who helped drive the business
both to the top of fashion's radar screen and into financial ruin.
Joshua Levine may be a member of all three groups, but none of them
are particularly well served by ``The Rise and Fall of the House of
Barneys,'' which details the history of the store, its fall from
grace three years ago and the wheeling and dealing that eventually
led to its salvation, its founding family's visions of greatness
and role considerably scaled down.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion followers will enjoy the anecdotes about Fred Pressman,
Barney's son, and his obsessions with the finding the perfect
glove. But their eyes will surely glaze over the endless pages of
financial data, which include dense details on eight months of
short-term loans and constant references to gross margins and net
earnings. Close followers of the retail industry might appreciate
the details of accounting games, as well as the tale of how the
store came to dominate a small segment of the luxury market. But
much of this, alas, has been reported before. And the handful of
people who actually care about the sex lives, personal grooming
habits and less-than-charming peccadillos of the Pressman siblings
will here find only a soupcon of detail, ranging from the mildly
interesting (who knew that Gene had such a great golf game?) to the
vulgar, unattributed and not terribly illuminating.
</P>
<P>
   Yet one wonders how Levine became so obsessed with his topic. No
doubt about it, Barneys' bankruptcy filing in 1966 caused the
fashion world to teeter nervously on its spiked heels. And the
Pressman family has been a colorful one; Barney Pressman was one of
the true great New York garment merchants, and his store was the
destination for men's wear bargain seekers in the second quarter of
the century. His son, Fred, and his grandson Gene have been
credited with discovering many an important design talent and for
having the smarts to begin selling women's clothes.
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of the day, Barneys is no Neiman Marcus, no Saks
Fifth Avenue, not even, in terms of importance to American retail,
a Sears, Roebuck. Although Barney Pressman founded the store in
1923, roughly the same time Neiman set up shop, it was not until
the late 1980's that Barneys branched out in the city and around
the country, bankrolled by the Isetan Company of Japan, with which
it would bitterly part in the 1996 bankruptcy proceedings. The Saks
name is known in the nation's remotest reaches, while Barneys plays
splendidly well on both coasts, and that is about where it ends.
Few working men can get away with the sorts of cutting-edge
fashions the store carries, and few women can afford or fit into a
size 6 from an avant-garde European atelier.
</P>
<P>
   Barneys' Chapter 11 filing and flirtations with foreign buyers
drew attention from the news media not because of the store's
importance in the global retail world but because of what it had
come to symbolize. With roughly $350 million a year in sales, it
was a speck of dust on, say, the floor of Wal-Mart, but its fancy
brands, celebrity following and chic black shopping bags were all
part of something profoundly New York. See a picture in In Style
magazine of some Hollywood confection doing her shopping? She is
probably walking out of Barneys. Hear of cool new cosmetics line?
It may be available only in Barneys. Tall woman, good haircut,
expensive shoes, job on Seventh Avenue? Barneys shopper.
</P>
<P>
   This book is at its best when it captures some of that excess.
Look here for the details of Barneys' expansion to Madison Avenue
in 1993, which included decorating an entire department of the new
store with goatskin and laying Carrara marble tile by tile into the
center of the main floor. Read about buying trips to Europe, where
characters out of a modern-day ``Breakfast at Tiffany's'' run about
in crazy outfits buying fabulous clothes. Confirm all your deeply
held suspicions about the markup on the clothes and the disdain the
help has often shown for its customers.
</P>
<P>
   But there are irritating lapses in the narrative. Connie Darrow,
for instance, who was the general merchandise manager in women's
apparel, is described in great detail. Then, one day, she is simply
gone. Darrow in fact ended up at Prada, but you never learn that
here. There is also something slightly odd in Levine's emotional
investment in his subject. While Levine, a senior editor at Forbes,
seems charmed with Barney and Fred Pressman and their legacies,
this sentiment is matched with an intense distaste for the youngest
Pressman boys, Bob and Gene, who were until recently co-chief
executives of the company (Gene is constantly called arrogant and
spoiled). Yet tales of family infighting, bitter personal acrimony
and reckless spending are only too common in family businesses,
especially, it seems, when the business is retail.
</P>
<P>
   If the story of Barneys' bankruptcy is more than a footnote in
the history of 20th-century retailing, then Levine may just have
cornered himself a market. But the fact that a family -- enthralled
by the deep pockets of Japanese investors -- built a hih-end
clothing mini-empire, took their show on the road and flopped,
fighting all the way over whose fault it was, is not the ``Yiddish
theater Euripedes'' that he claims. So there are fewer Barneys
stores now than there were a few years ago. The Pressman brothers
have had their wings clipped. Vulture investors now more or less
own the company. This is not the stuff of tragedy. It's really just
business.

 &UR; CHOIRGIRLS
</P>
<P>
   BY CHARLes Taylor
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If the Scottish novelist Alan Warner weren't so gloomy, he might
be a profanely raucous farceur. There are moments in Warner's third
novel, ``The Sopranos,'' when all hell feels ready to break loose.
The title refers to the teen-age choir members of Our Lady of
Perpetual Succour School for Girls. At large for a day in the big
city while they wait to represent their school at a national
singing competition, the five girls do everything they can to bring
disgrace upon it in the meantime. Already noodle-kneed from the
spiked soda they swig on the bus ride down, Orla, Manda, Kylah,
Chell (for Rachel) and Fionnula hit the city just in time to
receive Warner's blasphemous version of a sign from above. Looking
out the window of their rehearsal room, they see a couple
unashamedly having sex in broad daylight. Welcome to the promised
land.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of ``The Sopranos'' follows the girls' pilgrimages to
the shrines of pubs and McDonald's and French Connection as they
seek the sacraments of booze, clothes and sex. The ostensible
reason for their trip -- the singing competition -- is treated by
them as no more than an annoyance. The girls just want it to be
over in time to get back to their port town and hook up with the
submarine crew who are sure to be frequenting the local disco, the
aptly named Mantrap.
</P>
<P>
   The most likable thing about Alan Warner is that he's on the
side of these girls. It's refreshing to read a novel loaded down
with teen-age drinking, smoking, swearing and the urge for sex
(more than sex itself) and be spared the moralizing that usually
goes along with these activities. He's amused by his unholy choir,
but he also knows how important a Big Mac, or a new pair of Doc
Martens or a shot of flaming Sambuca is to them, and he refuses to
condescend. There's nothing new about the tribalism inherent in
their rituals, like the way they all crowd into the ladies' room at
McDonald's to trowel on makeup, and to swap their school uniforms
for too-short skirts, Wonderbras and platform shoes. But their
back-and-forth dialogue, with each interjection scrambling madly
over every other, captures both the vitality and the deadly
seriousness of their preparations.
</P>
<P>
   As a writer whose own sensibility has been formed by rock
culture (his novels are loaded with references to songs and bands),
Warner is predisposed to sympathize with the hellions and
troublemakers, even if that causes him to caricature the book's
adult authority figures, like the nun Sister Condron (inevitably
called Sister Condom). He understands that pop culture and consumer
culture are predicated on a promise of freedom, of release from
everything that's dutiful, drab and ordinary. He honors these
girls' belief that the freedom they seek is waiting for them in
purchasing a new skirt, buying another round of drinks, sleeping
with the next boy, even if he knows that belief is an illusion. Not
knowing it's an illusion is what keeps the sopranos in a state of
disreputable grace. Warner is in love with the idea of youth
itself, and pained by how fleeting it is. Early on he writes of his
quintet: ``They've youth; they'll walk it out like a favorite pair
trainers. It's a poem this youth and why should they know it, as
the five of them move up the empty corridors? We should get shoved
aside cause they have it now, in glow of skin and liquid clarity of
deep eye on coming June nights and cause it will go . . . After all
what do we amount to but a load of old worn-out shoes?''
</P>
<P>
   But hopelessness is a different thing from melancholy, and the
sense that there's nothing but hopelessness waiting for these girls
assumes a greater hold as the book goes on. ``The Sopranos'' takes
place in the same desperate, shabby port town as Warner's first
novel, ``Morvern Callar.'' In that book, the divide between young
and old didn't feel quite so great, largely because the heroine, in
her mid-20's, was beginning to recognize her own fate in the
fag-end lives of her elders, the endless work and worry about money
relieved only by nights at the pub. Warner still hasn't solved the
problems that dogged ``Morvern Callar,'' chiefly the inevitable
capitulation of character to the intractable forces of society. We
want something better for the strong, back-talking heroines he
creates than the bleak, numbed-out lives he appears to think are
their only prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Warner is also still prone to the sort of showy grotesque
episodes that the most famous current Scottish writer, Irvine
Welsh, tries to pass off as evidence of his transgressive refusal
to compromise. There's an unfortunate extended episode in which one
of the girls attempts to have sex with a terminally ill young man
in his hospital bed. And as soon as Warner mentions an animal, you
can be sure it will die a horrible death. The unexpected problem in
``The Sopranos'' is a sort of creeping sentimentality. Warner seems
to be buying sympathy for his characters by revealing that one has
cancer and one comes from a home so poor the family can afford only
one tub of hot water on bath nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos'' is as different from the book that preceded it,
``These Demented Lands'' (a novel whose hallucinatory prose recalls
William S. Burroughs and which has the feel of a sinister, vaguely
medieval bacchanal) as that book was from ``Morvern Callar.''
Warner is admirably nonrepetitive. He's also one of the most
frustrating talented writers around. ``The Sopranos'' finds his
strengths still waiting to overcome his weaknesses. Warner's
portrait of squalid Scottish port town life is grimly believable.
Too believable. He needs to take the leap of faith one of his
heroines does when she kisses the girl she has a crush on in full
view of her friends as the lights go up in the Mantrap. The
conviction Warner puts into that relationship, the implicit belief
that the chance the girls are taking is worth courting the
small-town gossip they'll face, belies his implicit message that
the promise of youth must inevitably be snuffed out. Warner's not
listening to all that his characters say. If you want to know where
that promise is in ``The Sopranos,'' it's in her kiss.

</P>
<P>
   BY DAVID TRAXEL
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In May 1939, The Saturday Evening Post assigned the Pulitzer
Prize-winning journalist Alva Johnston to determine who was
America's greatest living writer. The decision was to be based on:
``(1) The size of the writer's public. (2) His success in
establishing a character in the consciousness of the world. (3) The
possibility of being read by posterity.'' Johnston's judgment,
evidently made with little or no ironic intent, was that only Edgar
Rice Burroughs could lay claim to the crown. ``No other literary
creation of this century,'' he argued, ``has a following like
Tarzan.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarzan, Lord of the Apes, made his first appearance in the
October 1912 issue of All-Story magazine in a tale that took up
almost the whole issue. Only the third piece that the 37-year-old
Burroughs had ever submitted for publication, it proved
sensationally popular, beginning a career that almost overnight
rescued him and his family from near poverty. ``If I had striven
for long years of privation and effort to fit myself to become a
writer,'' he later admitted to one of his brothers, ``I might be
warranted in patting myself on the back, but God knows I did not
work and still do not understand how I happened to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Burroughs (1875-1950) had grown up restless and mildly
antiauthoritarian as the youngest in a family of four brothers in
Chicago. The Major, as his father, George Tyler Burroughs, was
called, was a Civil War veteran who had become a successful
entrepreneur. Edgar had no interest in academic affairs, and though
the Major sent him to Phillips Andover his stay at the exclusive
prep school was brief because of poor grades. Instead, like many
youths of his generation, he was driven by a desire for excitement
and an active outdoor life. He spent his early manhood working as a
cowboy, a gold miner, a railroad policeman and a trooper in the
Seventh Cavalry in the Arizona Territory. Marriage, children and
the realities of modern industrial America put an end to such
adventures, so he then tried his hand at more conventional
occupations, becoming a salesman (of pencil sharpeners, among other
items), a bookkeeper and an office manager -- all the while
pursuing various get-rich-quick schemes. Nothing worked out until
he happened to pick up some pulp fiction magazines. ``I remember
thinking,'' he wrote, ``that if other people got money for writing
such stuff I might, too, for I was sure I could write stories just
as rotten as theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Burroughs was capable of writing hundreds of thousands of
words a year and shunned second drafts, he would eventually publish
close to 100 books depicting warrior heroes who had been strangely
transported to exotic worlds: Capt. John Carter is a Civil War
veteran who ends up fighting evil forces on Mars, David Innes does
the same in the center of the earth, Carson Napier battles on Venus
and, of course, Tarzan is the unconquerable king of the jungle.
These superheroes all possess impeccable lineage (Tarzan, after
all, is really the English aristocrat Lord Greystoke, who is raised
by an ape when his parents die on a trip to Africa), but they are
willing to fight as savagely and joyously as any barbarian.
</P>
<P>
   Burroughs proved as adept an entrepreneur as his father and was
one of the first writers to incorporate himself, which both lowered
his income tax and provided a strong framework for all his varied
moneymaking efforts. Moving to Los Angeles in 1919, he purchased a
large ranch in the San Fernando Valley, which he later developed
into the suburb of Tarzana. His books' total sales were in the tens
of millions, and they were translated into more than 30 languages.
He also started a Tarzan radio show and a Sunday comic strip, and
he licensed a range of products from Tarzan statuettes to bathing
suits and bubble gum. The first Tarzan film was produced in 1918,
but real success came with the series starring the Olympic swimming
champion Johnny Weissmuller in the 1930's. Weissmuller's bare torso
and virile victory cry thrilled audiences from Milan to Manila.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Tarzan Forever,'' John Taliaferro, the author of ``Charles
M. Russell: The Life and Legend of America's Cowboy Artist,''
skillfully recounts the story of Burroughs and his creations and is
particularly good at showing how Burroughs fits into the growing
importance of popular culture in the 20th century. However, the
book would have benefited from deeper thinking about the
contradictions of the man himself. Why was Burroughs so driven to
see actual combat that he unsuccessfully tried to join Theodore
Roosevelt's Rough Riders during the Spanish-American War, then the
Army during World War I, before happily gaining credentials as a
front-line correspondent in World War II? How could a writer whose
early success came from the barely literate readers of pulp
magazines have been such a fervent believer in eugenics? (In a
screed from the 1930's he argued that because the unintelligent
were allowed to breed without restriction, ``the whole world was
constantly growing stupider.'') And what lay behind the
inconsistencies of his racism, where most often in his work he
would portray blacks (or Arabs or Asians) as evil or comic fools
yet occasionally show them as admirable and attractive? Burroughs
wrote about his own days in the frontier cavalry, ``I worked under
colored sergeants, and without exception they were better to work
under than our white sergeants.'' Immediately following Pearl
Harbor, he rabidly argued for isolating Japanese-Americans in
camps, but after he came to know some during the war he was able to
recognize them as patriotic Americans. Still, he thought, it would
be better if they had never immigrated to this country. Trying to
account for these complexities would have made for a richer study
of both the man and his times.
</P>
<P>
   By The Saturday Evening Post's criteria, a claim could still be
made for Edgar Rice Burroughs's importance as a writer: most of his
books remain in print, providing a solid income for his
descendants, and Tarzan continues to swing through the imagination
around the world. Taliaferro makes a few halfhearted attempts to
claim a more elevated literary reputation for Burroughs than that
of a mere pulp writer, as if he possessed talents for language and
characterization that have been unfairly ignored by elitist
critics. Burroughs himself suffered no such illusions. ``I don't
think my work is 'literature,' '' he admitted to an interviewer,
``I'm not fooling myself about that.'' Writers of popular
entertainment (he included himself) belonged ``in the same class
with the aerial artist, the tap dancer and the clown.'' That is
certainly an honorable enough place.

   In this tiresomely moralizing book, George Stephanopoulos proves
that self-castigation can be a device for avoiding
self-examination. Making of penitence a good career move, the
author repeatedly asks, ``What is a nice boy like me doing in a
brothel like the White House?'' The answer is that ambition and
idealism struck a bargain -- he would advance good goals by
maneuvering himself into a position to give good advice to the most
powerful person on earth. Unfortunately, he confesses, getting and
keeping the position near power involved endless compromise with
pragmatic decisions that in fact undercut the good advice.
</P>
<P>
   What he never questions is the nature and necessity of the
advice he was giving. The self-importance underneath the
self-criticism is breathtaking. This is an egocentric view of the
Administration in which Presidential success or failure depends on
what is happening in Stephanopoulos's little circle of influence.
The distorted view of the Administration's actions is signaled in
Stephanopoulos's treatment of Bob Woodward's book ``The Agenda.''
You would think, from his treatment of that volume, that this was a
major turning point in the White House's performance. Because
Stephanopoulos had promoted the idea of cooperating with Woodward,
and the President resented the book's conclusions, Stephanopoulos
lost his access to the inner circle around Clinton, and Dick Morris
was allowed to offer disastrous advice not countered by the sweet
reason of our hero. The only way Stephanopoulos could regain
access, given the consequences of the Woodward affair, was by
making a deal with Morris himself, a bargain with the devil that
solidified Morris's position instead of undermining it. Because the
book permanently damaged Stephanopoulos's standing, it became a
major factor in the failures of Clinton as a President.
</P>
<P>
   This egocentric way of weighing events is understandable; but if
Stephanopoulos is going to exaggerate the importance of a book, he
should at least understand what was involved in its appearance. He
claims that Woodward was essentially right in his conclusions, and
that Clinton simply resented the description of White House
decision making as chaotic. Despite the fact that Stephanopoulos
ruefully says he was wrong to promote Woodward's project as a way
of increasing his own importance, he does not get the real point of
``The Agenda'' and its impact not only on his own standing but on
that of his old War Room colleagues, James Carville, Mandy Grunwald
and Paul Begala.
</P>
<P>
   Those campaign veterans appeared in Woodward's pages as
defenders of Clinton's liberal campaign promises, as aides who
resented Clinton's antideficit strategy as a surrender to Wall
Street selfishness. In fact, this ``surrender'' was the key to all
of Clinton's later successes -- it turned around the economy and
laid the basis for the country's continuing prosperity. This entire
side of the matter either escapes Stephanopoulos or is cleverly
hidden by him. He was not wrong on a matter of procedure (putting
Woodward in a position to tell embarrassing truths) but wrong on
the substance of policy (joining Woodward in a view of the economy
that proved fundamentally mistaken). The President is presented by
Stephanopoulos as demoting him out of pique that truths were told,
whereas Clinton had good reason to pay less attention to a man who
had given such bad advice.
</P>
<P>
   For all his rather histrionic questioning of his own personal
motives, Stephanopoulos never investigates his own political
judgment, which was often poor (his political judgment is the
commodity he has on sale at the moment, which shows why a penitence
that quietly celebrates it is a good career move). The second most
important matter for Stephanopoulos, after his own demotion over
the Woodward book, was the rise of Dick Morris's influence in the
vacuum that (he is sure) was created by Clinton's turn from his
former adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanopoulos misunderstands the role of Morris. He merely
glances at the real damage Morris did -- the frenzy of fund raising
he inspired by his expensive and early ad campaigns. On the
substance of the advice given by Morris, Stephanopoulos follows the
conventional wisdom in Washington -- that Morris got Clinton to
adopt Republican programs, that little symbolic gestures (school
uniforms, for instance) covered a deep desertion of Democratic
principle. This was the deficit fight all over again, with Clinton
``surrendering'' to conservatives -- and, just as in that fight,
Stephanopoulos misses the point. Clinton's incremental emphases on
concrete, unquestionably good things that government can do changed
the whole political atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The antigovernmentalism that came to such noisy prominence under
Newt Gingrich has faded, has given way to a new desire for
governmental solutions to problems. By declaring that the era of
big government was over, Clinton removed the adjective that
Republicans had pinned to all government programs. Since he no
longer had to defend big government, just government, Clinton was
saving liberalism from the liberals, as Franklin D. Roosevelt saved
capitalism from the capitalists. Stephanopoulos, in his no doubt
justified resentment of Morris as a despicable creature, misses the
large electoral consequences of Clinton's 1996 victory (which
established the framework in which the public has been able to
judge Clinton apart from his personal scandals).
</P>
<P>
   This book demonstrates that the ``inside'' view of an
administration is not, of necessity, a better view of it. The view
is severely limited if one spends his entire time looking in a
mirror -- not only to behold his own features but to see who is
coming up behind him. In his self-flagellating self-promotion -- a
way of climbing on his knees -- Stephanopoulos regrets that his
vanity at times made it harder for him to advance his sound views.
</P>
<P>
   Those sound views included his recommendation that a political
philosopher like Stephen Carter of Yale University be put on the
Supreme Court, or that the Government should evade its own laws
against assassinating foreign rulers. It is a positive
recommendation of Clinton that he took less advice from
Stephanopoulos as time went on. It was this exclusion, not any
moral repugnance at power, that made Stephanopoulos a nervous
wreck, that made him strike a bargain with Morris to get into the
meetings with Clinton to which he was no longer invited: ``I was
excluded, which was killing me and my pride.'' Stephanopoulos not
only ``needed to be in those strategy sessions,'' the President
needed for him to be there. That is why Stephanopoulos ``had to hug
Morris to stop his crazy ideas before they went too far.''
</P>
<P>
   There is the real delusion of power -- that one defeats a Morris
by hugging him. Stephanopoulos gives us no real example of his
defeating Morris's views by entering into an alliance with him
(``we talked more than a dozen times a day''). He did not even
understand which of Morris's ideas really were crazy and which were
sound. (The President seems to have been able to distinguish the
two.) What we are offered in this book is a little moral homily on
the way a good Greek Orthodox altar boy was almost corrupted by
power, but finally escaped.
</P>
<P>
   But he was not corrupted by power. He was corrupted by the fear
of losing it, a fear he brought with him to the White House, not
one he picked up there. He tells us himself that he did not choose
Clinton as his candidate because he admired him. He admired Mario
Cuomo, had ties with Richard Gephardt and was urged by his family
to support Paul Tsongas because he was Greek. He went with Clinton
instead, since he thought he could win, and his famous funk over
the Gennifer Flowers revelation was less an expression of moral
repugnance than a frustration that his winner might be a loser
after all.
</P>
<P>
   The picture of Stephanopoulos that was established in the 1992
campaign, and perpetuated by the documentary ``The War Room,'' was
of the moral, quiet, sensitive foil to James Carville's flamboyant
win-at-all-costs ruthlessness. But there is a tough opportunism
about Stephanopoulos that the sentimental and quixotic Carville
lacks. A hint of it was seen in ``The War Room'' itself, when
Stephanopoulos was heard, on the phone, threatening a man about to
make public a Clinton scandal that he will never work for Democrats
again and will become ``scum.''
</P>
<P>
   We get further glints of that steel in this book, in italicized
put-downs of all the people he could not tell off to their faces
(muttering an internal obscenity when he is bawled out by Hillary
Rodham Clinton) or in asides like this: ``I like the idea of taking
out terrorists like Francois and Cedras'' in Haiti. Carville, the
antiracist Southerner from the large Roman Catholic family, will
always be a more trustworthy ally than Stephanopoulos, the
theologically trained schemer with the cherubic face.

   EASY RIDERS, RAGING BULLS: HOW THE
</P>
<P>
   SEX-DRUGS-AND-ROCK 'N' ROLL GENERATION SAVED HOLLYWOOD
</P>
<P>
   By Peter Biskind.
</P>
<P>
   Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $15.
</P>
<P>
   This gossipy account recalls the heyday of filmmakers like
Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola in the 1970's, when the
industry was driven by prodigious amounts of talent, hubris and
libido. The author ``knows where the bodies are buried . . . and
his eye for telling detail turns up enough fresh insights to keep
the book engrossing,'' Joseph McBride wrote here last year.
</P>
<P>
   ANTS ON THE MELON: A COLLECTION OF POEMS
</P>
<P>
   By Virginia Hamilton Adair.
</P>
<P>
   Modern Library, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 83 and blind for some years, the author overcame
her long reticence and published her first collection of verse. The
poems are brief and often deal with dark subjects -- Hiroshima, for
instance, or her husband's suicide -- but they cast a bright
afterglow and feature striking metaphors. ``She speaks directly and
unaffectedly, in an accent stripped of mannerism and allusion,''
Brad Leithauser said here in 1996. '' 'Ants on the Melon' exhibits
enough formal variety, freshness and intelligence to confirm . . .
that Adair is a poet of accomplishment and originality.''
</P>
<P>
   THE CREATION OF THE NIGHT SKY
</P>
<P>
   by Nicholas Christopher
</P>
<P>
   (Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $13), is a collection of poems
exploring the eternal realm toward which the human spirit aspires.
The book includes a group of linked poems about three characters
who cross paths in a single night; in 1998 our reviewer, Melanie
Rehak, called this ``a haunting, multifaceted work filled with
astonishing, surreal images.''
</P>
<P>
   RED-TAILS IN LOVE: A WILDLIFE DRAMA IN CENTRAL PARK
</P>
<P>
   By Marie Winn.
</P>
<P>
   Vintage Departures, $13.
</P>
<P>
   This affectionate account chronicles the stubborn attempt of a
young male hawk to build a life for himself and his offspring in
Central Park, and the dedicated band of bird-watchers (of whom the
author is one) who monitor its five-year struggle. ``Winn infects
the reader with her enthusiasm for life in the park,'' Patricia T.
O'Conner wrote here in 1998. ``And she tells many vivid and
affecting stories.'' Wickerby: An Urban Pastoral, by Charles
Siebert (Three Rivers, $12), is an unusual memoir whose poles are
the author's native Brooklyn and southern Quebec, specifically a
rundown cabin he escapes to when the city overwhelms him. ``To
reconnect humans with nature is one thing, but Siebert's enterprise
is to reconnect the city with nature,'' Verlyn Klinkenborg said in
these pages last year.
</P>
<P>
   THE ANTELOPE WIFE
</P>
<P>
   By Louise Erdrich.
</P>
<P>
   Harper Perennial, $13.
</P>
<P>
   This lyrical novel features multiple narratives of contemporary
American Indians living out their joys and sorrows on the
Midwestern prairie, but at its core are two related stories of
troubled marriages. ``There is light as well as darkness in this
fictional universe, and encountering it offers pain and
exhilaration in equal measure,'' Diana Postlethwaite said here in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   MARY THROUGH THE CENTURIES:
</P>
<P>
   Her Place in the History of Culture
</P>
<P>
   By Jaroslav Pelikan.
</P>
<P>
   Yale University, $14.
</P>
<P>
   A historian of Christian theology explores Marian devotion in
music, art and literature, presenting Mary as the bridge that links
Christianity to Judaism and Islam. ``There can be no doubt that the
Queen of Heaven would be pleased with this accolade, and no reader
will come away from the work without profit,'' Jo Ann Kay McNamara
wrote here in 1996. The same publisher has reissued Saints &AMP;
Sinners: A History of the Popes, by Eamon Duffy ($18.95), a
colorful overview of the papacy and how it has shaped the Roman
Catholic Church. The book ``includes both good illustrations and a
distinguished text,'' Henry Chadwick said here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A QUIET LIFE
</P>
<P>
   By Beryl Bainbridge.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll &AMP; Graf, $10.95.
</P>
<P>
   This novel follows the unraveling of a British family after
World War II, culminating in a darkly complicated domestic tragedy.
``Bainbridge's new novel works with the sly precision of a trap,''
Julia O'Faolain wrote here in 1977. ``She is a subtle and protean
writer.''
</P>
<P>
   THE EVERLASTING STORY OF NORY
</P>
<P>
   By Nicholson Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Vintage Contemporaries, $12.
</P>
<P>
   The novelist uses his celebrated skills in literary dissection
to comb the exuberant inner life of a 9-year-old American girl
spending a semester at an English school. ``Much of the novel is
pleasantly comic and, as always with Baker . . . the delight is
found in the details and the madcap invention,'' Robert McCrum said
here in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   THE FEMINIZATION OF AMERICAN CULTURE
</P>
<P>
   By Ann Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   Noonday/Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $15.
</P>
<P>
   The author argues that clergymen and sentimental female writers
collaborated in the 19th century to transform popular entertainment
and set the stage for modern consumer culture. In 1977 our
reviewer, Gerda Lerner, praised ``the textural richness and
methodological sophistication of this intellectual and literary
history.''
</P>
<P>
   LOVE IN A BLUE TIME
</P>
<P>
   By Hanif Kureishi.
</P>
<P>
   Scribner, $11.
</P>
<P>
   These short stories revolve around middle-aged protagonists
struggling to cope with stifling marriages and responsibilities in
a world that's stopped being fun. Kureishi has ``the master's touch
when it comes to making us feel we've been thrust into the thick of
things,'' Laura Miller wrote here in 1997. Scott Veale

 &UR; ALL THE PRESIDENT'S WOMEN
</P>
<P>
   BY TOM GOLDSTEIN
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If such a thing is possible, Michael Isikoff may be an
investigative reporter too tenacious, too eager and too focused for
his own good. What so marks the changed media landscape of
Washington in the 1990's is that Isikoff's formidable reporting,
not the publication of his work, became the engine that drove the
story of President Clinton's sexual indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   Just knowing that he was making inquiries affected the behavior
of key participants, both inside and outside the White House. From
grand jury testimony released last fall, it is clear that Kenneth
Starr, the Paula Jones legal team and even the President himself
made decisions based on what they knew or suspected about what
Isikoff knew. By mid-January 1998, as the Monica Lewinsky affair
became public knowledge, Isikoff was so deeply enmeshed in the
various stings and plots and investigations that, he writes in
``Uncovering Clinton,'' his how-I-got-the-story book, ``almost
anything I did was going to dramatically change the events I was
trying to cover.'' Isikoff, in other words, was so far ahead of his
competitors that he became part of the story. And it is one of the
ironies of his substantial career that he was scooped on his
biggest exclusives.
</P>
<P>
   While still at The Washington Post in 1994, he delved deeply
into Paula Jones's allegations that Bill Clinton, then Governor of
Arkansas, had asked her for sex in a Little Rock hotel room.
Isikoff bristled at the slow, careful editing of the story. After
shouting at an editor, he was suspended for insubordination. His
suspension was covered in The Washington Times, and conservative
groups took out advertisements, including some in The Post itself,
demanding that the paper publish his findings. Shortly after his
story was published, Isikoff departed for Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
   There, in 1997, he was working on a story that Clinton had
harassed Kathleen Willey, but before it appeared, Matt Drudge, the
Internet gossip columnist, reported that Isikoff had been holding
back on publishing just such an item.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, for many months Isikoff knew, from Linda Tripp, of the
liaison between Clinton and a young White House intern. When he was
ready at last to publish news of Starr's investigation into whether
Clinton had an affair with Monica Lewinsky and obstructed justice
by trying to cover it up, his superiors at Newsweek showed
admirable caution on deadline and held up publication. Isikoff was
scooped again by Drudge and then by his former colleagues at The
Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, however, it has been Isikoff who has received the
credit -- or blame -- for ferreting out the unappealing hidden side
of the President.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uncovering Clinton'' sets out in lucid, largely chronological
fashion how he got his stories. He forcefully defends his behavior,
which has come under attack from other journalists and Clinton
partisans. It is hard to render an absolute verdict on the
propriety of his actions based just on his book, for it decidedly
presents one (admittedly one unusually knowledgeable) person's
version of reality. But Isikoff makes a plausible case -- perhaps
the best case that could be made -- for continuing to pursue a
story that could possibly have brought down a President. At times,
as he acknowledges, sometimes directly, sometimes opaquely, Isikoff
became too immersed in his story.
</P>
<P>
   Books in which reporters take center stage are a special genre.
In ``All the President's Men,'' Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein
describe a colleague: ``She knew that she was about to become part
of the story -- a situation that is congenitally distressing to
reporters.'' As it was to Isikoff, who was ``inspired'' by Woodward
and Bernstein as a college student (he does not say where he
studied, one of the many details about his personal life that the
reader doesn't learn). He expresses dismay, even bewilderment,
about his role. In the course of tracking down the Willey story, he
discovered that the President knew he was working on it long before
it was ready for publication. Isikoff remembers wondering, ``What
in God's name was I in the middle of?'' Several months later, as
Linda Tripp and Lucianne Goldberg tried to orchestrate Clinton's
downfall using Isikoff as their vehicle, he began, he says, ``for
the first time really, to feel strange myself about what was going
on -- and what I was doing.'' He realized something ``that should
have been apparent much earlier: I was in the middle of a plot to
get the President.'' Like Woodward and Bernstein, who freely
acknowledged their mistakes and their ethical lapses, Isikoff
confesses to error and to crossing the line of proper reporting
while trying to negotiate ``treacherous and uncharted territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Isikoff is particularly proud that he declined to listen to the
Tripp-Lewinsky tapes while Tripp was still taping. He was offered
the opportunity months before Starr had even heard of Lewinsky,
but, he writes, he did not want to ``become part of the
process.''Had he agreed to listen, he says, ``for all intents and
purposes, I would have been writing Tripp's script. I would have
become her partner in the betrayal of Lewinsky.'' Shortly
thereafter, he chides himself for advising both Tripp and Lucianne
Goldberg that it would be ``really stupid'' to peddle a book by
Tripp because she ``would only have to testify about it.'' At this
point, he says he realized, he was ``too involved to avoid
influencing the players.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in recounting a tense standoff with Jackie Bennett,
Starr's chief Washington deputy, Isikoff sounds more inquisitor
than reporter. Bennett, Isikoff says, wanted Newsweek to hold off
on the story of the special prosecutor's Lewinsky investigation in
return for ``an even better story down the road.'' This is how
Isikoff recalls the conversation: ``We need to know everything you
know,'' Bennett told him. To which he replied, ``Look, you guys are
the ones that need to cooperate with me.'' It was, Isikoff
concedes, ``a form of blackmail. I was threatening to make him look
really bad if he didn't give me information.''
</P>
<P>
   Isikoff is careful to document his rationale for his hot pursuit
of the President. In the beginning, in 1994, the issue for Isikoff
was not whether Clinton had ever committed adultery. Rather, it was
more fundamental: ``a continuing pattern of reckless and even
compulsive behavior that, if true, would almost surely affect the
course of his Presidency.'' Then, in May of that year, Clinton
hired a high-profile criminal defense lawyer. ``The fact that the
President would hire Bob Bennett to represent him against the
claims of Paula Jones bestowed official legitimacy on a story that,
until then, The Post had been afraid to touch,'' Isikoff says. And
when the Supreme Court unanimously rejected the President's claim
of immunity from civil litigation while in office, the Paula Jones
lawsuit became ``justification'' for publishing, he says.
``Clinton's sexual behavior was inevitably going to be front and
center.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not Watergate,'' Isikoff writes in his epilogue.
``But that doesn't mean it wasn't right to undertake the
enterprise.'' If journalism is the first draft of history, let him
have the last word on this second draft: ``There are no easy
answers here.''

 EVENSONG
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Gail Godwin.

</P>

 &UR; WE'VE GOT COMPANY
</P>
<P>
   BY CLAIRE MESSUd
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Gail Godwin's new novel is a sequel not to her last book, ``The
Good Husband,'' but to its predecessor. Told by the young Margaret
Gower, ``Father Melancholy's Daughter'' was the coming-of-age story
of an Episcopal minister's child, set in a fictitious Virginia
town. That novel closed with a series of letters and diary entries
in which Margaret made tentative plans for her future, holding out
the promise of her as-yet-untried adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evensong'' is the novel of that adulthood. It is also a novel,
set on the cusp of the millennium, in which our society's anxieties
are played out in microcosm. Now in her early 30's, Margaret Bonner
(nee Gower) is herself a pastor, ministering to the congregation of
All Saints in the Smoky Mountain town of High Balsam, N.C. Her
husband, Adrian, 20 years her senior, is also a priest, serving as
chaplain and acting headmaster of a boarding school for troubled
children. Like Margaret's father -- the melancholic of the earlier
novel -- Adrian is a depressive, and at the outset of the book the
couple's marriage is in difficulty: Margaret, whose mother
abandoned her husband and daughter when Margaret was only 6, is
contemplating a similar escape.
</P>
<P>
   What impels rapprochement in the Bonner household is the
appearance of three unlikely -- and somewhat unwelcome --
characters. Grace Munger, a pushy evangelical manipulator who is
organizing an ecumenical Millennium Birthday March for Jesus, will
not accept Margaret's polite refusals to participate. She is more
imperious but less insinuating than Brother Tony, an 80-year-old
itinerant lay monk who lands on the Bonners' doorstep ostensibly by
accident but with no apparent intention to decamp. And finally
there is 16-year-old Chase Zorn, whose antics at Adrian's school
lead to his expulsion; for Chase, the Bonners' rectory is a last
resort before reform school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evensong'' takes place over the course of a few weeks in late
November and December of 1999 -- during Advent, ``that season of
spiritual expectation in the church calendar'' -- but its
flashbacks and anecdotes fan out to encompass much of Margaret's
and Adrian's lives. Readers unfamiliar with ``Father Melancholy's
Daughter'' need not be deterred: in the course of ``Evensong,''
Godwin provides a meticulous precis of the other book.
</P>
<P>
   Meticulousness and precision are, indeed, Godwin's greatest
strengths. In matters liturgical and clerical, her command is
impeccable. Godwin imbues Margaret with an authentically -- and
impressively -- broad range of religious references, from St. Hilda
of Whitby to St. Augustine to Andre Malraux. The novel is not,
however, mired in abstruse theological arguments. Like its
protagonist, it moves between Christianity's philosophical
considerations and its most practical concerns, and dwells
primarily upon the latter. Godwin's portrayal of the competitive
congregations and gossiping denizens of High Balsam is as astute as
her knowledge of church lore is comprehensive.
</P>
<P>
   Other aspects of the novel, however, are less thoroughly
convincing. Godwin has produced a curious hybrid book, for which
the conceptual collision of Armageddon and small-town America is an
apt representation. While Margaret and Adrian and their friends are
so recognizable as occasionally to verge on banality, the three
catalytic characters who descend on High Balsam seem to have been
zapped in from some other America, mythical and cartoonish. The
absurdly named Chase Zorn, for example, is a Peruvian orphan
adopted by Radford Zorn, ``the happy hometown theme-park mogul.''
Grace Munger's histrionic evangelism (``I'm black and blue and
slain in the Spirit'') and her flamboyant character are parodic and
hence dismissible. And Tony -- whose story is integral to the plot
and hence not to be revealed here -- is Dickensian both in his
complicated history and in the few, broad traits that are used to
sketch his character (oddly dyed hair, an interest in homeopathic
healing, talent as a short-order cook).
</P>
<P>
   THE uneasy cohabitation of Margaret Bonner with these characters
reflects an unresolved tension in Godwin's work between the
literary and the popular, between a striving for truth and a desire
to entertain. Godwin's writing itself reflects this anxiety. There
are bursts of frankly terrible prose, some merely careless (``he
purred in his soft croak'') but some an uncomfortable marriage of
the pretentious and the colloquial, the novelistic equivalent of
middle-management-speak:
</P>
<P>
   ``I had given up trying to fight these reruns from days when
more things happened than I could absorb, or when too many enigmas
taxed my limited powers of discernment. I allowed the leftovers to
play themselves out, mutating into whatever they wanted to be next.
Meanwhile I tried to stay connected to a quieter part of me who
waited in the background for the cessation of all this outer
business. After the cessation sometimes came lucidity, in which a
different kind of communication could take place. More often it
didn't come: the day's noises and pictures rolled on and on, I got
sucked into the show, then would suddenly snap out of it with a
jolt, caught red-handed in the midst of some self-serving (or
equally extravagant self-defeating) reverie.''
</P>
<P>
   Veering from obfuscatory Latinate diction (``discernment,''
``mutating,'' ``cessation,'' ``lucidity'') to cliche (``snap out of
it,'' ``with a jolt,'' ``caught red-handed''), with an odd mixing
of metaphor along the way (can leftovers play themselves out, let
alone mutate?), this passage exemplifies the dangers Godwin faces
in attempting to render widely accessible her characters' more
complex thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Like Walker Percy, a fellow Southerner whom she could be said to
resemble in both her moral seriousness and her perceptiveness,
Godwin is not essentially a stylist. And yet, in spite of its
infelicities and occasional straining for effect, ``Evensong''
lingers in the mind. This has much to do with the honesty of its
portrait of a young woman struggling with life's fundamental
questions -- with faith and family, with the patterns that define
her own identity.

   The Story of One Marriage.
</P>
<P>
   By John Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Random House. $22.95.

   ------
 &UR; READER, I DIVORCED HER
</P>
<P>
   BY RICHARD A. SHWEDEr
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It may be hazardous to take sides when a marriage breaks apart,
but it's irresistible. John Taylor is a former senior writer for
Esquire magazine and the author of ``Storming the Magic Kingdom,''
and ``Falling'' is his ironic account, written from a ``male
perspective,'' of just how distressing it can be to get divorced.
The book, a specimen of an emerging genre -- caricature of the
illogic of misalliance or satire about the painful experience of
marital demise -- is discordant and unsettling, and the results are
mixed.
</P>
<P>
   The author opines, philosophically and ambivalently, about the
fragility, even pointlessness, of old-fashioned Victorian ideals
like duty, sacrifice and commitment. He tells his story and hers
too. And he derides or burlesques almost everything in sight:
liberated women, marriage counselors, trial separations, mediated
settlements, even the various women with whom he had extramarital
affairs. Consider Jill, for example, the impulsive artist from
Oregon who was always being overtaken by some terribly important
``new enthusiasm,'' like building a meditation pyramid for the
homeless, and who treated him as one of her ``new projects.'' There
is probably nothing Taylor could have done about the failure of his
marriage. But let us at least hold him responsible for the failure
of his irony, which all too often evolves into sarcasm, leaving the
reader with the impression that a bitter lampooner might be far
more difficult to live with than a resentful wife.
</P>
<P>
   The resentful wife is Maureen, an older woman (she was 34 when
they married; he was 28), an Englishwoman (he is American), a
Jewish woman (he is Unitarian). Before the marriage she was
liberated, cosmopolitan, self-confident and employed. By the time
their union dissolved, 11 years later, she had become a lapsed
writer, a frustrated, unemployed parent trapped by her own opinion
that work is unfulfilling and motherhood unchic. Taylor, always the
ironist at heart, represents Maureen as a byproduct of our times.
There he is, ready to bail out. There she is, metamorphosed into a
dependent spouse whose only remaining ideal of liberation is her
sense of entitlement to lifetime maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor can be effective with his quips and retorts: ``Failure
can be gratifying, even liberating; it relieves you of the need to
aspire''; ``I'd had an affair to escape the burden of marriage, and
the affair had become as burdensome as the marriage.'' There are
times when his one-liners make you smile: ``Ed and Meg had four
children, a family so unusually large by the standards of the
neighborhood that it was as if they practiced some archaic
religion.'' Some of his descriptions ring all too true. Here is his
Darwinian stockbroker's advice on the survival of the fittest:
``You know what's the object in a divorce? . . . Pre-emptive
retaliation. Here's what I want you to do. Clean out your bank
account before she does it for you. Hide your assets.'' If you ever
wondered whether Plato was right that a society designed by the
wise would prohibit divorce, you may find yourself pondering the
question again.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Taylor will even succeed in getting you not to like him.
He is an author who describes himself as ``constitutionally
ambivalent,'' as someone who ``never developed the habit of
honesty,'' as violent, as oppositional, as a man in search of a
moral compass. And he employs a method of provocation that is not
only aggressively ironic but also disorienting, almost by design,
or perhaps by nature. The more he intermingles mordacious taunts
with apparently earnest reflections on the feelings and choices of
a man suffocated by a less than satisfying matrimony, the harder it
is to take him seriously or to distinguish what's satirical from
what's sincere. He composes a tribute to the glories of returning
home to the atmosphere of a Victorian household. ``I . . . kissed
first my wife,'' he tells us, ``and then my daughter, and as they
returned to their tasks and I fixed myself a Scotch I was overtaken
with a feeling of pure, exultant harmony.'' Feigned? Who's to know?
His daughter, he's just noted, is sitting at ``the old upright
piano we bought for $100 and spent $500 to have moved and to whose
yellowed ivory keys she had affixed animal stickers.'' Or he
writes, seemingly straight-faced, ``My wife had wanted to have a
child, and now I thought she was doing what she wanted to do,
staying home and looking after the baby while I worked to pay the
bills, which was what I wanted to do.'' One begins to wonder, who
is this masked man who seems so intent on forcing the reader to
have doubts about even his sober voice?
</P>
<P>
   A prominent Manhattan family lawyer, a friend of mine, once told
me: ``Men are weak; men are wrong. But if they stay in a failed
marriage, it is usually for the kids, the money or out of a sense
of duty.'' Taylor has many things to say about the kids, the money
and the sense of duty -- for example, that if you invoke duty,
perhaps ``you hadn't thought the matter through.'' As for who's
right and who's wrong. . . .

<P>
   Rather than claiming to have constructed a definitive history of
performance art, RoseLee Goldberg acts like a diligent film editor
or museum curator to assemble PERFORMANCE: Live Art Since 1960
(Abrams, $60), a collection of photographs of performance art.
There are shots of Marina Abramovic weeping as she scrubs cow bones
and Yasumasa Morimura striking a pose as Scarlett O'Hara. While
such images may be difficult to comprehend, much less to form into
a coherent narrative, Goldberg does isolate what the works of this
genre -- inspired by everything from classical theater to digital
animation -- share: origins in a world on the verge of information
overload, a world more and more coming to resemble an outlandish
theatrical event, a world devoid of stable definitions. And
although she has divided the images into such ostensibly tidy
categories as ``The Body'' and ``Identities,'' Goldberg ultimately
refrains from defining these inherently unclassifiable works; she
seldom goes beyond asserting that an artist's works ``have an
underlying social commentary'' or put forth a ``sophisticated take
on American society.'' Goldberg in fact works much like a
performance artist, allowing the images to speak for themselves.
``Performance,'' accordingly, mimics the culture that informs them;
readers are barraged with data and are subjected to a parade of
fragmented images in the place of real, firsthand experience. In
the end, Goldberg's self-conscious, anticritical stance is
admirably respectful to the spirit of performance, but one wishes
she had not forfeited eloquence to make her point. _ CHRISTINA CHO

   REMEMBERING SLAVERY
</P>
<P>
   African Americans Talk
</P>
<P>
   About Their Personal Experiences
</P>
<P>
   of Slavery and Freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Edited By Ira Berlin, Marc Favreau and Steven F. Miller.
</P>
<P>
   New Press, $49.95.
</P>
<P>
   Following the turbulent failure of Reconstruction, much of white
America, both South and North, began portraying slavery as a
benevolent institution. To counter that pernicious view, which was
quite pervasive at the start of the 20th century, black scholars
began interviewing former slaves. While white historians dismissed
these narratives as unreliable or tangential to slavery's ``larger
meaning in American life,'' they inspired writers and folklorists
like Zora Neal Hurston, John Lomax and John Henry Faulk, as well as
a group of interviewers from the New Deal's Federal Writers'
Project, who spent much of the 1930's and early 40's traversing the
South, speaking with thousands of additional subjects.
``Remembering Slavery'' contains excerpts from interviews with
about 100 former slaves who testified to the terrifyingly arbitrary
nature of the peculiar institution (the book is accompanied by two
audio cassettes). These firsthand accounts describe the nearly
inconceivable violence to which so many slaves were subject. One
nurse recalls that when her charge injured his hand, her mistress
took a hot iron and ran it down her arm, searing her flesh. Another
woman remembers how her master hitched a slave to a plow and beat
him until he died. While the large number of passages shows the
diversity of slave experiences, and that there were indeed some
kindly masters, one wishes that the editors had included fewer
subjects with longer excerpts. This would have allowed for deeper,
individuated portraits of those who lived to tell of this most
disgraceful period in our nation's history. _ JOHANNA BERKMAN

   A NEARLY NORMAL LIFE
</P>
<P>
   A Memoir.
</P>
<P>
   By Charles L. Mee.
</P>
<P>
   Little, Brown, $24.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, Charles Mee, a 14-year-old high school football player
from Barrington, Ill., was stricken with spinal polio, a viral
disease with no known cure. More than 50,000 cases were reported
that year, mostly of young people who took sick during the summer
months. A national panic ensued. Cities closed pools and beaches;
families canceled vacations, boiled their dishes and avoided indoor
crowds. Children were warned against jumping in puddles, drinking
from water fountains and making new friends. The March of Dimes
became the country's favorite charity, spurring the vaccine
research by Jonas Salk and Alfred Sabin that all but eradicated the
spread of polio in the United States. In this elegant memoir, Mee
contrasts his painful experiences as a polio survivor against the
relentlessly optimistic backdrop of the 1950's. Unable to walk
without crutches, isolated from old friends, a disappointment to
his father, Mee found solace in books and in sleep. His new friends
came from the margins of society, where no one, he claims, is ever
quite whole. Mee, a playwright and the author of 15 books, endured
years of personal anguish, heavy drinking and drug abuse. It took a
long time for his rage to dissipate, and longer still to understand
that polio can't be beaten, only accepted. ``I am no longer
interested in recovery or restitution,'' he writes, adding, ``How
else my life might have been is unknowable; and the truth is, I
wouldn't change it for any other.'' _ DAVID OSHINSKY

   THE TWILIGHT OF THE INTELLECTUALS

   Culture and Politics in the Era of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   By Hilton Kramer.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan R. Dee, $27.50.
</P>
<P>
   After hard service in more recent culture wars, Hilton Kramer
turns in his new collection of essays to New York and the cold war
years -- to Alger Hiss and Whittaker Chambers, Lillian Hellman and
Mary McCarthy, Irving Howe, Philip Rahv, Partisan Review and The
New Republic. For many of this generation, their fashionably
progressive sentiments became what Kramer regards as a distinct
pathology. His epitaph for one old friend, Josephine Herbst, could
serve for most: however often Communist Party policy changed,
``when she was overruled and told, in effect, to shut up, she shut
up and she stayed shut up.'' Such writers betrayed their own
ambitions and harmed others: to mourn for leftists blacklisted in
Hollywood, Kramer writes, is to forget that Communists ruthlessly
blacklisted their own foes. He honors a few rare figures who he
thinks showed integrity: Lionel Trilling, Sidney Hook and Whittaker
Chambers, who made something Dostoyevskian out of his careers as
spy, reporter and Government witness. Other essays skewer Mary
McCarthy, ``a political pen for all seasons,'' who could play to
the mainstream of the 1950's, then change with the times and praise
what she called the ``virtuous tyranny'' of Ho Chi Minh's North
Vietnam. Two thoughtful pieces on Clement Greenberg recall that the
cold war era was also the moment when New York's painters eclipsed
those of Paris -- and suggest that the Abstract Expressionists, who
caught their culture's spirit without taking on its political
engagements, had learned something that the writers never could. _

   WHAT THE PEOPLE KNOW

   Freedom and the Press.
</P>
<P>
   By Richard Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University, $19.95.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Reeves here plays the crusty reporter who revels in
journalism's romantic past and bemoans its uncertain future. Most
of the dangers he describes in ``What the People Know'' are already
familiar. Satellites and the Internet now allow for instantaneous
news; the reporter's traditional job -- finding, sorting and
evaluating facts -- has come to seem extraneous, a luxury for which
there is no time. And the corporate takeover of news departments
makes conflicts of interest inevitable. But Reeves, a syndicated
columnist and author of ``President Kennedy: Profile of Power,''
also blames his colleagues for the problems facing journalism. He
argues that reporters, filled with hubris after their Watergate
triumph, communicated a simple message about politicians: ``Throw
them out, despise them, they're irrelevant.'' And the public has
believed them. But by degrading their subjects so effectively,
journalists have made themselves irrelevant as well; why bother
reading a story with a Washington dateline if every politician is a
crook? To regain public attention, reporters now attempt to seduce
the populace with sex, sports and scandal. Of course, this effort
to titillate and entertain merely trivializes the profession
further. Reeves worries about the future of the republic bereft of
a vigorous, independent Fourth Estate, but in this book he is
really mourning the loss of a cherished life style, a life style
filled with glamour, excitement and the heady freedom to follow a
story wherever the truth leads. He worries that a new breed of
reporters will be forced to peck away at keyboards in the tiny
cubicles of international conglomerates -- just like everybody
else. _ DOUGLAS A. SYLVA

   ``All of my fingers have been broken from being stomped on,''
says T-Bird Murphy, the teen-age narrator of Eric Miles
Williamson's first novel, EAST BAY GREASE (Picador USA, $23). ``My
head's been knocked so many times, I wouldn't be surprised if I was
permanently stupid.'' Set in Oakland during the 1960's and 1970's,
this novel is a lively -- not to say wrenching -- contribution to a
seldom recognized genre: the Internal Combustion Novel. As in Harry
Crews's ``Car'' and Joseph Torra's more mystical ``Gas Station,''
the hero of ``East Bay Grease'' spends his days in an environment
that's so filthy nothing can ennoble it. T-Bird may be the best
trumpeter in the Jack London High School band and a pretty smart
kid despite all the hard knocks he's taken, but it would take a
miracle to get him out of the asphalt hell he inhabits along with
his mother, a bikers' moll, and his father, an auto mechanic and a
savage rube. Only in the sour air of the dockside bars, in
punishing work and in music does he find relief. Williamson so
convincingly depicts the cruelty of some of his characters that he
seems almost scared of them. The feeling is contagious. Yet when
T-Bird is finally ready for his shining moment soloing with Los
Asesinos, a Mexican-American band as brilliant as it is tough,
Williamson's writing becomes transcendent. His prose cuts loose in
torrid rhythms that evoke the peril and exuberance of jazz. _ SALLY

   THE UMBRELLA COUNTRY
</P>
<P>
   By Bino A. Realuyo.
</P>
<P>
   Ballantine, paper, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   The ``umbrella country'' of the poet Bino A. Realuyo's first
novel is the Philippines, where Gringo, 11 years old, lives in
Manila with his family. Through Gringo's puzzled, apprehensive
eyes, the household is revealed as a pressure cooker of longing and
rage. Gringo's father, Daddy Groovie, is an unemployed construction
worker who dreams of escaping to ``Nuyork'' and visits his
disappointment on his wife and eldest son, Pipo. The rebellious and
flamboyant Pipo, who craves his macho father's approval, terrorizes
Gringo in his turn. Gringo's resigned mother spends longer and
longer hours at her Singer sewing machine, while his ``godmother of
words,'' Ninang Rola, curses and comforts volubly, but continually
warns that ``certain things are better kept than said.'' Indeed, as
Gringo observes, ``Silence had a way of creeping into our house.''
The adults explain nothing, neither private woes, like his mother's
bruises, nor social ills, such as the nightly curfew or the sexual
stigma that surrounds a hairdresser named Boy Manicure. Inevitably,
the violence within Gringo's household and in Boy Manicure's shadow
world erupts in forms that cannot be ignored, and Gringo must
choose whether to sacrifice himself or his brother to public shame.
The results of his decision are oddly anticlimactic; the story
closes abruptly with a half-anticipated departure and the
dissolution of the family. Nevertheless, Realuyo's lucid prose,
unencumbered by sentimentality or hindsight, lends freshness to the
conflicts of his somewhat familiar characters and color to a
setting both impoverished and alluring. _ LAURA MORGAN GREEN

   THE TALE OF A DOG
</P>
<P>
   From the Diaries and Letters of a Texan Bankruptcy Judge.
</P>
<P>
   By Lars Gustafsson.
</P>
<P>
   New Directions, paper, $11.95.
</P>
<P>
   Franz Kafka meets Italo Calvino in this new novel by the Swedish
writer Lars Gustafsson. In 31 first-person vignettes, a Jewish
bankruptcy court judge in Texas named Erwin Caldwell circles and
recircles around the revelation that his college mentor, the
philosopher-semanticist Professor Jan van de Rouwers, was not a
former Dutch resistance fighter as he presented himself but a Nazi
collaborator instead. When van de Rouwer's pajama-clad body is
discovered in Texas' Colorado River, Caldwell begins to confess to
strangers that he recently beat to death a stray dog which had
raided neighborhood garbage cans. This compulsive repetition
suggests a connection between the two events, and the judge
unconvincingly denies murdering the professor. Gustafsson, who
teaches at the University of Texas, uses the rising of the river, a
visit from Caldwell's stepdaughter and grandson, and excursions
into stores that sell books, health food and groceries as the
backdrop of this haunting and sparely told investigation into moral
bankruptcy. Unfortunately, the very British translation by Tom
Geddes makes it hard to believe that the narrator is a native
Texan. A checkout clerk at a supermarket operates a ``till'' ; his
grandson, suffering like Caldwell from insomnia, wanders through
the house at night carrying a ``torch''; when a local boathouse
burns down, the ``fire brigade'' is summoned. In a novel in which
the central question is the narrator's reliability, such jarring
lapses in language come between reader and an otherwise intriguing
story. _ GRETCHEN HOLBROOK GERZINA

   THINE IS THE KINGDOM
</P>
<P>
   By Abilio Estevez.
</P>
<P>
   Arcade, $25.95.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban poet and short-story writer Abilio Estevez's debut
novel is a hugely ambitious effusion of magical realist mythmaking.
The novel is set on the eve of the Castro revolution in an
abandoned Havana estate known as the Island, where more than a
dozen characters tell their stories in dizzying counterpoint. The
eccentric cast includes the crazed Barefoot Countess; a gay
bookseller named Uncle Rolo; a former opera singer and her mute
pastry-selling husband; a ``Wounded Boy'' who may or may not be St.
Sebastian, and the author himself, who occasionally intrudes to
suggest alternate narratives. Their stories crisscross in a flurry
of shifting pronouns and a constantly ambiguous mix of time and
place, replete with a Gothic creation myth centered on an
incestuous brother and sister. Estevez's prose is rich with
allusions to art and literature, and in David Frye's translation it
rolls in lucid, rhythmic waves. The disembodied, dreamlike
narrative serves its purpose: Estevez immerses us in history in
order to transcend it, shuffles the temporal in order to suggest
the eternal. As for the mixed identities of the multiple narrative
voices, Estevez explicitly invokes that eternal tale-teller
herself, Scheherazade. The freedom of art is set against the
confinement of political and geographic realities. But Estevez is
so intent on making the narrative earth disappear beneath our feet
that by the time the calendar flips to that fateful day of Jan. 1,
1959, when Castro's forces overthrew the Batista regime, you might
find yourself yearning for some old-fashioned modernism. _ JON

   THE TESTAMENT
</P>
<P>
   By John Grisham.
</P>
<P>
   Doubleday, $27.95.
</P>
<P>
   John Grisham's 10th novel lacks both courtroom and sustained
drama, but it's nevertheless entertaining. ``The Testament''
introduces us to Troy Phelan, a thrice-married billionaire who is
disgusted with his no-good offspring, who have already spent the $5
million he gave each of them upon turning 21. Before committing
suicide, Phelan signs a surprise will that leaves most of his
fortune to Rachel Lane, his illegitimate daughter, who is a
missionary in Brazil. Nate O'Riley, a big-time litigator (and an
alcoholic habitually in and out of rehab), is dispatched to track
Rachel down. Here the action cuts from the colorful if cardboard
ingrate heirs and their sleazy lawyers to Nate's adventures in
Brazil's remote Pantanal region, where Rachel is believed to be
living among an isolated tribe of Indians. Oddly, it's these scenes
-- of indistinguishable tributaries, menacing storms and deadly
fevers -- that seem most authentic. Nate finds Rachel, is struck by
her simple existence, and realizes his own life needs work. Nate's
search for redemption, which might have become hokey, is quite
convincing. The big question -- what will Rachel do upon learning
she has inherited $11 billion -- is nicely resolved. But don't
expect eloquence. If you can ignore such ungainly sentences as

<P>
   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

<P>
   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending March 20, at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such
outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of nonfiction can change from week to week, reflecting
changes in book buying.

   An (x) following a book's ranking indicates that a book's sales
are barely distinguishable from those of the book above. A (b)

 By ROBERT FISK  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time _ last week, in fact _ we went to war to save
the Kosovo Albanians. After months of negotiating and a thousand
broken promises, NATO's patience was exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   It was time to teach the Serbs a lesson and _ dare we suggest it
_ revenge ourselves on Serbian President Slobodan Milosovic, not
just for Kosovo, but for the years of Western humiliation in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But it was for the Kosovars, the 90-percent Muslim population of
Serbia's Kosovo province, that we would draw the sword.
</P>
<P>
   And our war is turning into disaster. The moment NATO's bombs
and missiles began to fall, the Serbs struck ruthlessly against the
Albanians of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are being helped by NATO and NATO is our enemy and now
the Albanians are calling up NATO's air strikes,'' a young Serb
official snapped angrily at me on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The separatist Kosovars _ from being merely recalcitrant or, at
worst, ``terrorists'' _ have now become fifth columnists. And fifth
columns are always destroyed by occupying armies.
</P>
<P>
   Thus has come about what NATO now admits to be the greatest
humanitarian crisis since the Second World War. And already we are
being deceitful to both the victims and the aggressors.
</P>
<P>
   Within two days of the first air strikes _ when it became clear
that the Serbs were ``cleansing'' their way through Kosovo; when
the first 20,000 refugees washed up on the frontiers of Macedonia
and Albania _ U.S. President Bill Clinton, the architect (along
with Richard Holbrooke) of this particular adventure, made an
astonishing statement.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the bloodshed would have been ``even worse'' if
NATO had not intervened. And he assured the American people that
U.S. troops would only be sent into Kosovo in a peacekeeping role.
</P>
<P>
   How happy President Milosovic must have been to hear that.
Already, Clinton was making excuses for NATO's air raids _ and then
promising that ground troops would never be sent to fight Serbian
forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   So Milosevic's army pressed on eagerly. And when the next flood
of Kosovars staggered into Macedonia with their stories of summary
executions and house-burning, we were told yet again that things
would have been worse without the air raids.
</P>
<P>
   Once NATO admitted that 500,000 Kosovars had been displaced,
this lie was mercifully forgotten. Instead, the air raids would be
increased, the rules of engagement broadened, in order to end
Serbia's ``scorching'' of Kosovo's earth. The fruits of war had now
become the reason for its enlargement.
</P>
<P>
   A terrible formula has now emerged, one that the Kosovo Albanian
leadership is only beginning to understand. We in the West cared so
much for their people's suffering that we went to war to end their
grief and bring them peace. But we would not risk the life of a
single soldier to do this.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser Wilhelm's policy _ that the Balkans were not worth the
life of a single Prussian grenadier _ has been adopted to the
letter by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Even as distraught women were entering Skopje with tales of the
execution of intellectuals in Pristina, a British officer
vouchsafed the opinion in Macedonia that ``we are here simply to
implement a peace agreement and that's what we will do, if (sic)
and when we get the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   So, more comfort for President Milosevic. However reasonable
this sounds in Washington and London, the message for the Serbs is
clear. NATO _ supposedly the iron shield of Western democracy in
the event of a Soviet invasion of Western Europe _ cannot even
defeat Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The men who were trained to defend the Fulder Gap against
Moscow's legions are going to sit it out in the hills of Macedonia
_ to act as peacekeepers ``when they get the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   We cry for the Kosovo Albanians. Perhaps we even love them. But
we will not die for them. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 225 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 650) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we seek more monsters to justify our continued war.
George Robertson, Britain's beloved defense secretary, has
reintroduced the world to the arch-villain Arkan, ``ethnic
cleanser'' par excellence in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Arkan is an indicted war criminal. Robertson spent some
time dwelling upon the deeds of this ``outrageous thug.'' But the
fact is that Arkan's cruelty was made manifest in Bosnia, not in
Kosovo. There is no evidence _ so far _ that his ``Tigers'' are
murdering Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, NATO itself cannot be humiliated on the eve of its
50th birthday. This was one of the raisons d'etre of this war over
the weekend. Presumably, we would have been less keen to bomb
Serbia if it were the 49th birthday or the 51st birthday...
</P>
<P>
   There is, needless to say, one very clear way that NATO could
show its teeth _ by arresting two Serb warlords even more infamous
than Arkan: General Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadjic.
</P>
<P>
   How strange that Robertson didn't mention those two indicted war
criminals last week. Why didn't he? Because he forgot? Or because
Mladic and Karadjic happen to reside in Bosnia, in a district
controlled by the very NATO troops whose reputation must be
defended by going to war with Serbia?
</P>
<P>
   Why doesn't Robertson order their immediate arrest? Is it
because such arrests might be resisted, and NATO lives lost? &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM; COPY RESUMES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton told us, too, that if we didn't continue the
war against Serbia, then we would see repeated ``what happened in
Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
   The West has every reason to feel humiliated by its performance
in the face of evil in Bosnia. And to blame Milosevic as one of
those who shamed us _ and let's not muddy the waters by remembering
the ruthless Croatian President Franjo Tudjman's ``cleansing'' of
170,000 Serbs from Krajina _ is fair enough.
</P>
<P>
   But to go to war to avenge ourselves for the Bosnian war was
folly. And it is becoming ever more clear that this is partly what
NATO's first-ever conflict is about. It is about getting our own
back.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, we are enduring the usual half-truths. Before America
bombed Libya in 1986 and Iraq in 1991, Washington insisted that it
had no argument with the ``Libyan/Iraqi people.'' President Clinton
said the same after he bombed Afghanistan and Sudan last year.
</P>
<P>
   And sure enough, just days ago, the Americans _ joined this time
by the British _ repeated the same old lament. We had nothing
against the Serbian people. It was just ``Milosevic's murder
machine'' that we hated. But, again, our hatred was not enough to
die for. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 225 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,100) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the next few days, two possible scenarios are likely to
present themselves to President Clinton and Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   One will be to grit their teeth and go for the kind of haven
created for the Kurds in northern Iraq in 1991. The other is to pay
a humble visit to the Secretary General of that poor old donkey,
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The first would be costly _ Serbia has promised to fight an
invader, not slink away as Iraq did after the Gulf conflict.
</P>
<P>
   If NATO troops were to get involved in a firefight in Kosovo, it
would betray every promise that Clinton made to the Americans.
Bodies would probably come home in coffins. But the promise to the
Kosovo Albanians would have been honored.
</P>
<P>
   The second would be an experience deeply humbling to all the
armchair warriors who have been preaching the morality of war to us
over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, of course, President Milosevic may capitulate. Or he may be
overthrown. But if he does not give up, NATO commanders may have to
decide whether to put their soldiers' lives on the line for the
policies of their governments, or hand the cause of peace in Europe
to the U.N.
</P>
<P>
   Sane men would probably go for the U.N. option. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM; COPY RESUMES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Kosovo Albanians are the ones who have chiefly
been doing the dying over the past week. No doubt the survivors
will thank us for our sympathy. &QL;

 &HT;    IRAQIS BECOME BEDFELLOWS WITH SERBS IN BATTLES WITH U.S. AND THE
WEST
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ Beleaguered Iraqis had been savoring some peace
and quiet while their new soul mates in Yugoslavia carried on a
battle against the West, but U.S. air strikes here Friday served as
a reminder that, while out of the international limelight, Iraq is
still within firing range.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. warplane attacks on two communications facilities in
Southern Iraq were the first since March 19.
</P>
<P>
   There were no deaths reported from the strikes, but they showed
American willingness to wage air campaigns simultaneously against
two countries. The attacks also fulfilled a vow from U.S. officials
that they would not ease up on Saddam Hussein amid the Balkan
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the air strikes were mild compared to bombing which was
especially heavy last December. And Iraqis seemed to relish their
relative safety, letting Yugoslavia _ what Western leaders might
consider an appropriate bedfellow _ top the world news.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fed up with being the center of events. We want to have
a quiet time,'' said Khudeir Al-Duleimi (CQ BOTH), editor of the
government-run Baghdad Observer.
</P>
<P>
   CNN's Yugoslavia coverage was on a large television in his
office, but Duleimi was preoccupied with a project he has
undertaken. He is writing a summary for the Iraqi Ministry of
Information of ``Endgame,'' a new book by former U.N. weapons
inspector Scott Ritter.
</P>
<P>
   These days, scaffolding envelopes the offices of Saddam
Hussein's Baath Party headquarters, which was destroyed by a series
of direct hits in December. A giant crater in a downtown avenue has
been filled and paved over.
</P>
<P>
   The government press center, where hundreds of reporters
gathered in December, is empty. And the so-called ``minders,''
government employees assigned to foreign reporters, stay home or
sit languidly in their lounges watching the events in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Al Rasheed Hotel, which has served as a sort of dormitory
for reporters when the Iraqi story has been hot, has been quiet,
save for a noisy anniversary party a few days ago for a television
station headed by Saddam Hussein's son, Odai.
</P>
<P>
   Ties between Iraq and Yugoslavia go back long before Saddam
Hussein's regime was isolated by economic sanctions in 1991. Many
Iraqis used to accept scholarships to attend Yugoslavian
universities and there is even a high school in Belgrade that
caters to Iraqis living abroad there.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the two allies are joined in their underdog battle against
what one Iraqi newspaper called the ``hollow hegemony'' of America.
</P>
<P>
   Western press reports state that the two governments are
exchanging information on air strike defenses, possibly even
meeting in person and swapping their military equipment.
</P>
<P>
   One Iraqi official said there is friendship, but not a military
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Iraq resisted (the United States), it encouraged others
to resist,'' said Naji Hadithi, a high ranking Iraqi information
ministry official who soon will become his country's ambassador to
Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the economic sanctions facing both countries, he said,
they have learned that it is better to ``resist with dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   The NATO strikes are front page news here and the government
hosted a press conference where a Yugoslav embassy official talked
about the conflict. But, Iraqi press accounts are about the only
news most Iraqis get. The reports never remind readers that the
Kosovar Albanians who are the subject of Serb aggression are fellow
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqis, long suspicious of Western motives, do not seem to care
when this is noted to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``(NATO) says they are defending Muslims and fighting
Christians, but they are not. America just feels that any country
that develops itself needs to be knocked down,'' said Hassan Ali,
42, a retired soldier.
</P>
<P>
   One victim of a U.S. warplane strike in December said his Muslim
loyalties do not outweigh his concern for Serbian families
suffering as his own family did.
</P>
<P>
   Jassim Ghelan Zubeidi, 41, and his family have been watching the
news about Yugoslavia. ``It is as if they keep running a film of
what happened to us,'' he said. ``Innocent people are killed these
days for nothing except NATO's desire for expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   In a civilian upper class section of Baghdad in December, a
missile slammed through the bathroom wall of Zubeidi's seven
bedroom house, seriously injuring him and his 10-year-old daughter,
Susan.
</P>
<P>
   Zubeidi, who worked in Russia for several years and now imports
supplies under the United Nations oil-for-food sanction regime, has
healed and has rebuilt his house.
</P>
<P>
   Susan appears healthy and clearly recites songs she wrote in
Arabic about missile strikes. But, she still faces a third surgery
to repair a skull facture.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the U.S. ambassador to Jordan, Zubeidi recently
asserted a legal claim for $100 million in damages for the injuries
he says were inflicted on him, his daughter and their property by
American warplanes. He has yet to receive a response.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time _ last week, in fact _ we went to war to save
the Kosovo Albanians. After months of negotiating and a thousand
broken promises, NATO's patience was exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   It was time to teach the Serbs a lesson and _ dare we suggest it
_ revenge ourselves on Serbian President Slobodan Milosovic, not
just for Kosovo, but for the years of Western humiliation in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But it was for the Kosovars, the 90-percent Muslim population of
Serbia's Kosovo province, that we would draw the sword.
</P>
<P>
   And our war is turning into disaster. The moment NATO's bombs
and missiles began to fall, the Serbs struck ruthlessly against the
Albanians of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are being helped by NATO and NATO is our enemy and now
the Albanians are calling up NATO's air strikes,'' a young Serb
official snapped angrily at me on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The separatist Kosovars _ from being merely recalcitrant or, at
worst, ``terrorists'' _ have now become fifth columnists. And fifth
columns are always destroyed by occupying armies.
</P>
<P>
   Thus has come about what NATO now admits to be the greatest
humanitarian crisis since the Second World War. And already we are
being deceitful to both the victims and the aggressors.
</P>
<P>
   Within two days of the first air strikes _ when it became clear
that the Serbs were ``cleansing'' their way through Kosovo; when
the first 20,000 refugees washed up on the frontiers of Macedonia
and Albania _ U.S. President Bill Clinton, the architect (along
with Richard Holbrooke) of this particular adventure, made an
astonishing statement.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the bloodshed would have been ``even worse'' if
NATO had not intervened. And he assured the American people that
U.S. troops would only be sent into Kosovo in a peacekeeping role.
</P>
<P>
   How happy President Milosovic must have been to hear that.
Already, Clinton was making excuses for NATO's air raids _ and then
promising that ground troops would never be sent to fight Serbian
forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   So Milosevic's army pressed on eagerly. And when the next flood
of Kosovars staggered into Macedonia with their stories of summary
executions and house-burning, we were told yet again that things
would have been worse without the air raids.
</P>
<P>
   Once NATO admitted that 500,000 Kosovars had been displaced,
this lie was mercifully forgotten. Instead, the air raids would be
increased, the rules of engagement broadened, in order to end
Serbia's ``scorching'' of Kosovo's earth. The fruits of war had now
become the reason for its enlargement.
</P>
<P>
   A terrible formula has now emerged, one that the Kosovo Albanian
leadership is only beginning to understand. We in the West cared so
much for their people's suffering that we went to war to end their
grief and bring them peace. But we would not risk the life of a
single soldier to do this.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser Wilhelm's policy _ that the Balkans were not worth the
life of a single Prussian grenadier _ has been adopted to the
letter by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Even as distraught women were entering Skopje with tales of the
execution of intellectuals in Pristina, a British officer
vouchsafed the opinion in Macedonia that ``we are here simply to
implement a peace agreement and that's what we will do, if (sic)
and when we get the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   So, more comfort for President Milosevic. However reasonable
this sounds in Washington and London, the message for the Serbs is
clear. NATO _ supposedly the iron shield of Western democracy in
the event of a Soviet invasion of Western Europe _ cannot even
defeat Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The men who were trained to defend the Fulder Gap against
Moscow's legions are going to sit it out in the hills of Macedonia
_ to act as peacekeepers ``when they get the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   We cry for the Kosovo Albanians. Perhaps we even love them. But
we will not die for them. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 225 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 650) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we seek more monsters to justify our continued war.
George Robertson, Britain's beloved defense secretary, has
reintroduced the world to the arch-villain Arkan, ``ethnic
cleanser'' par excellence in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Arkan is an indicted war criminal. Robertson spent some
time dwelling upon the deeds of this ``outrageous thug.'' But the
fact is that Arkan's cruelty was made manifest in Bosnia, not in
Kosovo. There is no evidence _ so far _ that his ``Tigers'' are
murdering Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, NATO itself cannot be humiliated on the eve of its
50th birthday. This was one of the raisons d'etre of this war over
the weekend. Presumably, we would have been less keen to bomb
Serbia if it were the 49th birthday or the 51st birthday...
</P>
<P>
   There is, needless to say, one very clear way that NATO could
show its teeth _ by arresting two Serb warlords even more infamous
than Arkan: General Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadjic.
</P>
<P>
   How strange that Robertson didn't mention those two indicted war
criminals last week. Why didn't he? Because he forgot? Or because
Mladic and Karadjic happen to reside in Bosnia, in a district
controlled by the very NATO troops whose reputation must be
defended by going to war with Serbia?
</P>
<P>
   Why doesn't Robertson order their immediate arrest? Is it
because such arrests might be resisted, and NATO lives lost? &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM; COPY RESUMES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton told us, too, that if we didn't continue the
war against Serbia, then we would see repeated ``what happened in
Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
   The West has every reason to feel humiliated by its performance
in the face of evil in Bosnia. And to blame Milosevic as one of
those who shamed us _ and let's not muddy the waters by remembering
the ruthless Croatian President Franjo Tudjman's ``cleansing'' of
170,000 Serbs from Krajina _ is fair enough.
</P>
<P>
   But to go to war to avenge ourselves for the Bosnian war was
folly. And it is becoming ever more clear that this is partly what
NATO's first-ever conflict is about. It is about getting our own
back.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, we are enduring the usual half-truths. Before America
bombed Libya in 1986 and Iraq in 1991, Washington insisted that it
had no argument with the ``Libyan/Iraqi people.'' President Clinton
said the same after he bombed Afghanistan and Sudan last year.
</P>
<P>
   And sure enough, just days ago, the Americans _ joined this time
by the British _ repeated the same old lament. We had nothing
against the Serbian people. It was just ``Milosevic's murder
machine'' that we hated. But, again, our hatred was not enough to
die for. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 225 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,100) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the next few days, two possible scenarios are likely to
present themselves to President Clinton and Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   One will be to grit their teeth and go for the kind of haven
created for the Kurds in northern Iraq in 1991. The other is to pay
a humble visit to the Secretary General of that poor old donkey,
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The first would be costly _ Serbia has promised to fight an
invader, not slink away as Iraq did after the Gulf conflict.
</P>
<P>
   If NATO troops were to get involved in a firefight in Kosovo, it
would betray every promise that Clinton made to the Americans.
Bodies would probably come home in coffins. But the promise to the
Kosovo Albanians would have been honored.
</P>
<P>
   The second would be an experience deeply humbling to all the
armchair warriors who have been preaching the morality of war to us
over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, of course, President Milosevic may capitulate. Or he may be
overthrown. But if he does not give up, NATO commanders may have to
decide whether to put their soldiers' lives on the line for the
policies of their governments, or hand the cause of peace in Europe
to the U.N.
</P>
<P>
   Sane men would probably go for the U.N. option. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM; COPY RESUMES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;

   Meanwhile, the Kosovo Albanians are the ones who have chiefly
been doing the dying over the past week. No doubt the survivors
will thank us for our sympathy. &QL;

   For years the Kosovars confined their opposition to Serb rule to
nonviolent protests. When the Croat president Franjo Tudjman urged
them to rise in 1991, at the height of Croatia's war with
Yugoslavia, the Kosovo leader Ibrahim Rugova refused. ``We would be
massacred,'' he told me in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   But after Croatia and then Bosnia broke away, the Kosovars
frustration with Rugova's tactics boiled over and so the KLA was
born.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of the Kosovo Liberation Army early last year were
dismissed at first as Serbian propaganda, aimed at justifying
Belgrade's worsening repression of the province's 2 million
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   But in spring the new rebel army burst onto the world stage,
rapidly overrunning large tracts of the province and even
attempting to take over the large central town of Orahovac.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``army'' still seemed an exaggeration for the ragtag
groups of farmers and school teachers with rusty rifles and
mismatched uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   But they did have some money, funnelled back into Kosovo from
the huge Albanian diaspora based in Switzerland, Sweden, Germany
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs decided to let the KLA overextend itself, in order to
have the excuse to crush both the KLA and the villages and towns
where they were strongest.
</P>
<P>
   In a massive assault last summer, Orahovac and many other
villages were smashed to pieces and thousands of civilians driven
from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Serb offensive, which is vastly bigger in scale and
scope, appears to have thrown the KLA completely onto the
defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been told to make no offensive attacks on the
Serbs,'' said Isa Zymberi, a Kosovar representative in London.
``They don't want it to look as if they are taking advantage of air
strikes. All the units still inside Kosovo are engaged in helping
the civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Zymberi said the KLA was still operating but was crippled by a
lack of weapons. Neighboring Albania, Europe's poorest state, is
unable to do much to help. Tirana is also wary of openly flouting
the international arms embargo on former Yugoslavia, which covers
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of arms is the main problem,'' Zymberi said. ``The
KLA enjoys widespread support. Every Albanian supports them. They
would have 200,000 fighters today if they had the arms, but they
have none and have to turn people down as a result.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What they want is covert arms supplies but they don't seem to
have received any yet,'' says Tim Judah, a Balkan expert who has
studied the KLA in detail.
</P>
<P>
   He cautions against writing off the organization, just because
they are not confronting the Serb tanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last summer they melted away when the Serbs arrived. But after
they had swept through, the KLA soon reappeared behind them,'' he
said. ``The Serbs simply don't have enough men to be everywhere in
Kosovo all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   And one KLA source, who wanted to remain anonymous, said the
organization was ``euphoric'' about the support they were starting
to receive from the West.
</P>
<P>
   Once dismissed in the West as ``terrorists,'' they now seem the
West's best alternative to putting in ground troops. ``We are
practically part of NATO now,'' he said. &QL;

Serbs,'' said Isa Zymberi, a Kosovar representative in London.
``They don't want it to look as if they are taking advantage of air
strikes. All the units still inside Kosovo are engaged in helping
the civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Zymberi said the KLA was still operating but was crippled by a
lack of weapons. Neighboring Albania, Europe's poorest state, is
unable to do much to help. Tirana is also wary of openly flouting
the international arms embargo on former Yugoslavia, which covers
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of arms is the main problem,'' Zymberi said. ``The
KLA enjoys widespread support. Every Albanian supports them. They
would have 200,000 fighters today if they had the arms, but they
have none and have to turn people down as a result.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What they want is covert arms supplies but they don't seem to
have received any yet,'' says Tim Judah, a Balkan expert who has
studied the KLA in detail.
</P>
<P>
   He cautions against writing off the organization, just because
they are not confronting the Serb tanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last summer they melted away when the Serbs arrived. But after
they had swept through, the KLA soon reappeared behind them,'' he
said. ``The Serbs simply don't have enough men to be everywhere in
Kosovo all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   And one KLA source, who wanted to remain anonymous, said the
organization was ``euphoric'' about the support they were starting
to receive from the West.
</P>
<P>
   Once dismissed in the West as ``terrorists,'' they now seem the
West's best alternative to putting in ground troops. ``We are
practically part of NATO now,'' he said. &QL;

<P>
   There is a sense of deja vu about the ongoing mission of Yevgeny
Primakov, the Russian prime minister, to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Gulf war Primakov visited his ``old friend'' Saddam
Hussein to broker a peace deal with Iraq. Then as now, it would be
impossible for the Western Allies to accept the aggressor's offer
of a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   With Saddam it would have meant accepting his seizure of Kuwait.
With Slobodan Milosevic, President of Yugoslavia, it would mean
rewarding his ethnic terror in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   However, this is no reason to denigrate Russian efforts to find
peace. For not the least casualty of the air strikes is the
cooperation on foreign policy and military matters which the West
and the Russians have developed since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   A Pan-Slav campaign to defend the Serbs is unlikely. But the
West should not ignore Russia's sense of betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   Russia accepted the eastward expansion of NATO and military
cooperation with the West on the grounds that NATO was a defense
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The West is in danger of teaching a generation of Russians to
distrust international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The need for the West to be sympathetic to Russian's sense of
hurt is strengthened by its partial responsibility for Russia's
economic predicament.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to guide Russia from a command to a market economy
was correct. But the means chosen were far too theoretical and the
pace was far too fast.
</P>
<P>
   Western economists neglected to wait for Russia to develop the
legal and social infrastructure that prevents capitalism from
degenerating into gangsterism.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, the West can afford to listen to Russia's
roars with equanimity. Despite its geographic size and large
population, Russia's economy is smaller than Holland's. It needs
its IMF loans too much to fight for Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   But in the longer term, Russia's sense of betrayal could be
dangerous to the West.
</P>
<P>
   It will increase the appeal of nationalist politicians, such as
Vladimir Zhirinovsky, and those people within and close to the army
who regret Russia's loss of status. Both groups will make the task
of developing a liberal and democratic politics in Russia much more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   A desire to build up the power of Russia could encourage the
meddling in neighboring states and arms trading which the West has
tried to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Small countries with restive Muslim minorities _ Armenia and
Georgia, for instance _ might become fearful of U.S. intervention
and want to tighten their borders with Russian weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The outrage of the Russian people will die down once the Kosovo
campaign is over. The man in the Moscow underground has only the
vaguest idea about Milosevic and the issues at the heart of the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the West will have to struggle to reintegrate
Russia in international institutions. The IMF could begin that
process today by providing Russia with a generous loan. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ Just after NATO's air strikes on Yugoslavia began
last week, Belgrade state television entertained its viewers with
the film, ``Wag the Dog.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a genius to show at such short notice a perfect copy _
equally perfectly subtitled into Serbian _ of Hollywood's fantasy
about an American president who manufactures a totally artificial
war in Albania to escape from private scandal.
</P>
<P>
   But no longer do the people of Yugoslavia have to turn to
Hollywood. For to live in Belgrade just now is to see the Balkan
war through a looking glass.
</P>
<P>
   While BBC World, Sky TV and CNN show a war in which Kosovo
Albanians suffer, Belgrade television portrays NATO's attacks as an
act of international aggression against an innocent nation _ Serbia
_ which is fighting for its life against KLA ``terrorism'' in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of fleeing Albanian refugees, it shows bombed-out Serb
homes in Kosovo, wounded children _ Albanian and gypsy as well as
Serb _ in a damaged Pristina hospital, and a massive haul of arms
captured from Kosovo Albania guerrillas by young Yugoslav soldiers,
one of whom eagerly passes on his love for his mother in Subotica
the moment a microphone is waved in front of his face.
</P>
<P>
   Even the military briefings are a mirror-image of NATO press
conferences. While RAF officers turn up to talk to journalists in
Brussels, Yugoslav Air Defense Commander General Spasoje
Smiljanovic invited us for a Yugoslav armed forces military
assessment in central Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   In a massive room dripping with ornate chandeliers and decorated
with two gold twin-headed eagles of Serbia and Yugoslavia, the
general was even equipped with a slide projector and screen to
illustrate NATO air strikes and those countries involved in the
``aggression'' against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   A map showed guilty nations colored in purple, the innocent _
and Russia, of course, is a very big innocent _ in white.
</P>
<P>
   General Smiljanovic reels off the code-names of NATO jets
involved in the air bombardment with all the panache of a NATO
commander: F-15s, F-16s, F-18s, EAGD ``Prowlers,'' A-10s, E3-Awacs,
Mirages, Tornados, Harriers and B-52s.
</P>
<P>
   When America's downed F-117A ``Stealth'' fighter comes up on the
big screen, the general is in top form. ``It flew from New Mexico
to come to rest on Serb territory,'' he says sarcastically. ``Such
a pity! If it had come as a friend, it would still be flying.''
</P>
<P>
   He insists that Yugoslavia has sustained ``minimal losses''
among its air raid personnel _ just seven soldiers killed and 17
wounded (a lower figure than the weekend's) _ while admitting
``severe damage to stationary facilities and infrastructure''
costing US$300 million.
</P>
<P>
   And while Western television viewers were watching exhausted
Kosovo Albanian refugees talking of Serb executions and ``ethnic
cleansing,'' their Serb counterparts were seeing a badly damaged
hospital in Pristina reported to have been bombed by NATO aircraft
and a damaged maternity ward in which 51 babies were reportedly
rescued from incubators as the air attacks began.
</P>
<P>
   Film at a different clinic showed older children _ said to be
Albanian as well as Serb _ with serious stomach wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Third item on the national news here in the past 48 hours was a
dramatic report of a Yugoslav interception of Albanian
``terrorists'' carrying weapons into Kosovo, 13 of whom had been
killed, the remainder having fled back across the border.
</P>
<P>
   The film report _ and the arms _ appeared to be new; they
included a large number of anti-armor weapons, apparently of
Austrian manufacture.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo town of Djakovica had been attacked by NATO forces,
viewers were told, and dozens of civilian houses damaged along with
the town's Catholic church and monastery in the town.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs were outraged to be told that the Serb village of
Gracanica had been almost totally destroyed by NATO bombs. Other
reports said that KLA ``terrorists'' had attacked military
positions immediately they had been targeted by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, there have been Serb civilian casualties. Monday, for
example, CARE Australia reported that nine Serb refugees from
Krajina _ captured by Croatian forces more than four years ago _
had been killed in the town of Cacak, 85 miles from Belgrade, where
they had been living in an abandoned military barracks attacked by
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   General Smiljanovic, a gruff, grey-haired no-nonsense figure in
smart camouflage fatigues, insisted that Yugoslav air defense
forces had shot down 7 NATO aircraft _ NATO says it has lost only
one _ along with 3 helicopters, over 30 cruise missiles and three
pilotless NATO drone reconnaissance aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   NATO denies the helicopters although it has made no comment
about lost drones or missiles destroyed by ground fire. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 775. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   The general went out of his way to praise his Mig-29 pilots. And
indeed, Monday's issue of ``Soldier'' magazine _ the house journal
of the Yugoslav armed forces _ shows that Serb and Montenegrin
pilots are praised as much here as NATO's warriors of the air are
on BBC World.
</P>
<P>
   Mig pilots Nebojsa Nikolic, Predrag Milutinovic, Slobodan Peric
and Ilja Arizanov were all promoted to major by President Slobodan
Milosevic, who also promoted Pilot Zoran Radosavljevic to Captain
First Class.
</P>
<P>
   A Yugoslav medal of honour went to Artillery Colonel Sreo
Malinovic and to Air Force Major General Nikola Grujina for
defending ``the Fatherland's airspace.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for the gongs. In reality, Yugoslavia has shrewdly
maintained most of its mobile antiaircraft missile defenses intact,
keeping them deactivated and moving them around the country to
avoid NATO target positioning.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever air raid alerts suggest a threat to Mig airfields,
Yugoslav jets are scrambled, either returning to their air bases
after the alert or _ if their airfields are damaged _ landing on
the great highways that Tito built for just such a purpose more
than 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, despite all the NATO bombing, the Yugoslav armed
forces are far from down and out. Just who, one wonders here these
days, is wagging the dog? &QL;

the town's Catholic church and monastery in the town.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs were outraged to be told that the Serb village of
Gracanica had been almost totally destroyed by NATO bombs. Other
reports said that KLA ``terrorists'' had attacked military
positions immediately they had been targeted by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, there have been Serb civilian casualties. Monday, for
example, CARE Australia reported that nine Serb refugees from
Krajina _ captured by Croatian forces more than four years ago _
had been killed in the town of Cacak, 85 miles from Belgrade, where
they had been living in an abandoned military barracks attacked by
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   General Smiljanovic, a gruff, grey-haired no-nonsense figure in
smart camouflage fatigues, insisted that Yugoslav air defense
forces had shot down 7 NATO aircraft _ NATO says it has lost only
one _ along with 3 helicopters, over 30 cruise missiles and three
pilotless NATO drone reconnaissance aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   NATO denies the helicopters although it has made no comment
about lost drones or missiles destroyed by ground fire. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 775. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   The general went out of his way to praise his Mig-29 pilots. And
indeed, Monday's issue of ``Soldier'' magazine _ the house journal
of the Yugoslav armed forces _ shows that Serb and Montenegrin
pilots are praised as much here as NATO's warriors of the air are
on BBC World.
</P>
<P>
   Mig pilots Nebojsa Nikolic, Predrag Milutinovic, Slobodan Peric
and Ilja Arizanov were all promoted to major by President Slobodan
Milosevic, who also promoted Pilot Zoran Radosavljevic to Captain
First Class.
</P>
<P>
   A Yugoslav medal of honour went to Artillery Colonel Sreo
Malinovic and to Air Force Major General Nikola Grujina for
defending ``the Fatherland's airspace.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for the gongs. In reality, Yugoslavia has shrewdly
maintained most of its mobile antiaircraft missile defenses intact,
keeping them deactivated and moving them around the country to
avoid NATO target positioning.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever air raid alerts suggest a threat to Mig airfields,
Yugoslav jets are scrambled, either returning to their air bases
after the alert or _ if their airfields are damaged _ landing on
the great highways that Tito built for just such a purpose more
than 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, despite all the NATO bombing, the Yugoslav armed
forces are far from down and out. Just who, one wonders here these
days, is wagging the dog? &QL;

<P>
   In less than a week, the war in Yugoslavia has escalated beyond
NATO's initial aims. The evidence that women and children _ and
worryingly few men _ are fleeing from Kosovo to Albania proves that
the war has become a potentially genocidal conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The responsibility for this falls on Slobodan Milosevic,
president of Yugoslavia. He has exploited Allied air attacks to
step up his policy of eviction and slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to blame NATO for this. But Milosevic's campaign of
terror was heating up while negotiations were still under way with
the Allies and the Kosovo Liberation Army. And there is evidence
that the assault on the Kosovo Albanians began when the
international observers were pulled out, before the war started.
</P>
<P>
   After the recent murder of moderates, including Fehmi Agani, the
main adviser to Ibrahim Rugova, the Kosovar Albanians' voice of
peace, NATO members must accept that Milosevic has decided to keep
Kosovo as part of Serbia _ without its Albanian-speaking majority.
</P>
<P>
   In these circumstances, NATO's policy must move beyond
attempting to force Milosevic to implement the Rambouillet terms.
Indeed, these are already moribund.
</P>
<P>
   From punishing Serbian aggression in Kosovo, NATO must now act
to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   This could be accomplished in two stages. First, NATO must
change tactics. As well as diminishing the Serbian army's potential
to fight, NATO must, in particular, stop the fighting in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO will have to concentrate its force on the Serbian infantry,
tanks and armored personnel vehicles in the province. High-altitude
hit-and-run bombing missions will have to be supplemented by
lower-altitude attacks on infantry and vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The Afghan war showed how vulnerable aircraft are at such
heights. Inevitably, therefore, NATO and Western public opinion
must be prepared for the sight of body bags.
</P>
<P>
   Second, NATO will need to decide how this campaign is to end. It
has already gone on long enough without a focused picture of the
status quo post bellum.
</P>
<P>
   NATO should send in ground troops to establish a protectorate
over Kosovo. This would not only defend the lives of the province's
Albanian-speaking majority but also secure the territorial
integrity of Yugoslavia, so as to prevent the spread of the
conflict into neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
   There is already a partial precedent for this step in the shape
of NATO's presence in Bosnia. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 400) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Establishing a protectorate is a painful decision for which
there is little political consensus. So far, only Britain's Paddy
Ashdown's Liberal Democrats have given it their backing.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Blair, the British prime minister, announced in the House
of Commons last week that British soldiers would move into Kosovo
only with the consent of both Serbs and ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   This week, in a House of Commons exchange with Ashdown, Blair
moved towards this position, pointedly refusing to rule out the
idea of a protectorate. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Establishing a protectorate will entail casualties, and not a
little cost. Nonetheless, there is no other way, short of an
invasion of Yugoslavia, that NATO can prevent the pogroms that
occurred in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   A protectorate would also ease the pressure on Mediterranean
NATO states, including Italy and Greece. Italy's support for NATO
is becoming strained with the arrival of boatloads of refugees on
its shores.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of vacation resorts full of Kosovar refugees, and
beaches filled with antiaircraft batteries, is nightmarish for both
the country's politicians and its tourist industry.
</P>
<P>
   NATO must not dither, but resolve this crisis quickly _ not
least to prevent civilian casualties in Serbia proper.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is leading all the citizens of Yugoslavia into a dark
and frightening place; for all of their sakes NATO must swiftly
bring the war to a stable conclusion. &QL;

<P>
   BERLIN _ ``The Albanians are helpless,'' says Ilona Rothe.
``It's a crime what's happening to them. I don't know how I would
feel if I weren't personally involved.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Rothe is involved, because her son is one of 3,000
German soldiers awaiting orders in Macedonia. So she is against the
war in the Balkans, against NATO air strikes, and bitterly opposed
to German participation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rothe is the founder of ``Mothers Against the War,'' a
movement only a week old but already enjoying national fame.
</P>
<P>
   It began with a heartrending proclamation in the form of a
reader's letter addressed to a Berlin newspaper, accompanied with
her telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, she has received more than 1,000 calls, appeared on
television talk shows, and there is now talk of sending her to sort
it all out with Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have touched a nerve in Germany,'' she says. ``I hear the
women crying on the telephone for their beloved, their sons or
their husbands. They tell me about their suffering, and sometimes
about the medical treatment they are receiving for their anguish.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Balkans, no country in Europe has felt the trauma of
war as acutely as Germany. A nation of pacifists for two
generations, Germans now find themselves striding into the quagmire
of Yugoslavia, with soldiers and their relatives at home mentally
unprepared for shedding blood.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rothe's 24-year-old son _ she will not give his first name
because ``I've already caused him enough trouble'' _ signed up for
the Bundeswehr four years ago, expecting little travel and even
less action.
</P>
<P>
   For the last three weeks, they have all been waiting in
Macedonia for an order that up to recently would have been
unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``They lie awake at night, get up at half-past five in the
morning, and the first thing they do is listen to the news,'' Ms.
Rothe says. ``All sorts of questions are swirling in their heads:
`What happened last night? What if they fired a rocket at us? We
would be the perfect target.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rothe's son bears a weapon but he is a maintenance man for
the tank crews. He will not ride inside the tanks, if they ever set
off for Kosovo, and his gun is for self-defense only.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he and his comrades have done nothing more violent than
polishing the barrels, but the Luftwaffe is busy dropping bombs
Yugoslavia every day, and the possibility of using ground troops is
no longer excluded with as much vehemence as it was only a few days
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rothe, who in peacetime ran a removals firm in the east
German town of Erfurt, is trying to prevent that by giving peace a
chance. ``I heard an interview with a Serbian mother, in which she
said: `I want my son, I don't care about Milosevic.' That's how I
feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Her group proposes that ``all weapons fall silent immediately,''
and representatives from all sides uncompromised by past actions
gather around the negotiating table. Also in attendance should be
human-rights experts and an international womens' group.
</P>
<P>
   No, she does not think she is being naive. Naive were the
Western politicians ``who had eaten and drunk with Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They know what kind of a guy he is,'' she says. ``They have
given him one line: `This way or we bomb you.' And what have they
achieved? Did they not force the Serbs to close ranks? Are we not
risking a Third World War here?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We sit in front of the television in the evenings, and see
these wonderful computer simulations,'' she continues. ``And they
report that things are getting worse for the Serbs. And that one
atrocity is worse than the other atrocity. Somehow I just don't
understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no easy answers. But German public opinion, despite
the traditional misgivings, is slowly coming around to the
``something must be done'' view.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest polls, 28 percent reject the use of
ground troops, but 47 percent think the Bundeswehr should not stay
out if NATO soldiers were to cross into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But faced by the pictures of fleeing Albanians, support for air
strikes has increased, with 62 percent of Germans now in favor.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the east, where a few days ago less than half of those
polled approved of the bombing, there is now a narrow majority in
favor. Three-quarters of west Germans approve.
</P>
<P>
   While German newspapers remain at best skeptical, and
politicians on the left campaign for a cease-fire, one group of
Germans have undergone a spectacular metamorphosis.
</P>
<P>
   The Greens are pacifists no longer. According to the latest
polls, 72 percent of Green supporters say the air strikes are
justified.
</P>
<P>
   If the Yugoslav government wanted to destroy NATO's resolve by
engineering a humanitarian catastrophe, the gambit has clearly
failed in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The images of civilians in flight from organized brutality are
painfully familiar here, triggering knee-jerk reactions that
Germans thought they had purged long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must say, when I look at Milosevic, he reminds me of
Hitler,'' Ms. Rothe says. If her son were not in the firing line,
maybe even she could be persuaded to support bombing the Serbian
leader to smithereens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Couldn't somebody poison him?'' she asks, only half in jest. &QL;

<P>
   Fuel cells, devices that produce electricity from hydrogen with
only water as a byproduct, are emerging as the auto industry's
technology of the future _ the most promising alternative to the
internal-combustion engine. Manufacturers are racing to become the
first to put such a vehicle on the market. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fuel cells combine hydrogen with oxygen in an electrochemical
reaction that generates electricity; the hydrogen can be carried in
tanks or converted from methanol or gasoline. The cells have been
used in aerospace since the 1960s, but only in the last decade have
they been considered an alternative to a car's internal-combustion
engine. Now, most of the world's leading auto manufacturers have
fuel cell vehicles in the works. Some promise to have such a
vehicle on the market within five years.
</P>
<P>
   So far, DaimlerChrysler AG appears to be in the lead. The
company has invested on the order of $1.4 billion in fuel cell
research in the last five years _ both Daimler-Benz and Chrysler
were pursuing different strategies before they merged, and they had
demonstrated several fuel-cell prototypes. Last month in
Washington, DaimlerChrysler took the wraps off Necar 4, an A-Class
subcompact equipped with fuel cells. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fourth Daimler-based fuel-cell vehicle to be shown publicly,
Necar 4 _ for ``new electric car'' _ represented significant
breakthroughs. Its storage tanks for liquid hydrogen fuel, akin to
the vacuum bottles one might use to take soup on a picnic, are
inconspicuously stored beneath the floor, as are the stacks of
cells. The cargo area remains clear for luggage. The tanks and fuel
cells for previous Necars, the first of them shown in 1994,
consumed so much space that they had to be loaded into a full-size
van, leaving little room for people and none for cargo.
</P>
<P>
   The driving range of Necar 4 has been extended to 280 miles from
148 miles for Necar 2; few electric cars can go more than 150 miles
on a charge. Acceleration and top speed increased to 90 miles an
hour from only 68 mph for Necar 2.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler insists that it will offer fuel cell vehicles
for sale in 2004 _ perhaps as many as 100,000 a year. The company
already has fuel-cell buses operating in Los Angeles, Chicago and
Vancouver, British Colombia. Vancouver is the hometown of Ballard
Power Systems, a fuel-cell manufacturer partly owned by the
automaker.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Ford Motor Co., which also owns a piece of Ballard,
says it will have a fuel-cell car on the market at about the same
time as DaimlerChrysler. Ford showed its P2000 prototype, with the
body of a Ford Contour, at the Detroit auto show in January.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors Corp. asserts that it will have a
production-ready fuel-cell car by 2004. Opel, GM's European unit,
displayed a fuel-cell minivan in October. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Honda, Toyota and Nissan also have fuel cell cars in the works.
In Germany, BMW plans next year to have a small fleet of large
7-Series sedans equipped with an internal-combustion engine as well
as a fuel cell that would power accessories.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their promise, fuel cells still pose big hurdles, and
they are likely to be confined to commercial fleets, at least
initially. Cost is crucial. DaimlerChrysler executives estimate
that fuel cells remain 10 times too expensive; the cells for an
average-size car cost about $30,000, compared with only $3,000 for
a conventional engine. Still, that is much improved. Only five
years ago, fuel cells were at least 50 times more expensive than
they are today. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though they have become more efficient and much smaller, fuel
cells and fuel storage tanks remain heavy and bulky.
DaimlerChrysler engineers figure that the cars need to shed at
least 600 pounds. The small Necar 4 shown in Washington weighed a
whopping 3,800 pounds. As a result, acceleration is sluggish; the
car requires 6.5 seconds to reach 35 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest challenge, however, is the lack of an
infrastructure for producing, storing and distributing hydrogen.
The fuel is available in almost infinite quantities, but has to be
stored in liquid form on the Necar 4 at about 430 degrees below
zero. Only one public filling station for liquefied and gaseous
hydrogen exists _ at the airport in Munich, Germany. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The lack of infrastructure has led automakers to consider using
more common fuels, particularly methanol, to produce hydrogen
through the use of an on-board reformer. But a reformer adds even
more weight, takes precious space and adds another 25 percent to
the cost.
</P>
<P>
   There is research into the use of methane without a reformer,
although methane can contaminate the fuel cells. Before its merger,
Chrysler considered the novel approach of producing hydrogen
on-board by using gasoline. Though development continues on that
idea, DaimlerChrysler has been unable to make it work; the target
date for such a technology has been put off until 2010.

<P>
   The Balkans have a long history of bitter wars, but this is the
first one to be fought out in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The Allies may not be prepared, as yet, to commit ground forces,
but they had no hesitation in sending in the Internet against
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Websites set up by NATO and the British government were
pronounced a great success in the propaganda campaign, with
thousands of calls from Serbian surfers.
</P>
<P>
   The counterattack was swift, sneaky and showed the ruthlessness
of the Yugoslav leader, who has already been compared to Pol Pot by
ministers.
</P>
<P>
   His regime unleashed ``germ warfare'' against the NATO website,
sending in a wave of macro viruses. Then came phase two of the
operation, a specially manufactured program which carpet bombed the
site.
</P>
<P>
   This week the British site, set up by the Ministry of Defense,
with help from the Foreign Office, was reportedly safe from the
``mad hackers'' of the ``Butcher of Belgrade,'' as the tabloids may
put it, and attracting ever-increasing number of callers from
former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The site, led by a team under Richard Davies of the Defense
Information Department, was originally set up last October. From
the March 1 to 20 it received 1,024 calls. After air strikes began
the number climbed to 8,600.
</P>
<P>
   In the 24 hours since it was translated into Serbo-Croat, 1,500
``hits'' came in, 1,400 from former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Assessing the damage to NATO, service spokesman Jamie Shea said
in Brussels: ``Since the 28th of March the service from our
Internet home page has been erratic to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have looked at this very carefully and it seems that we
have been dealing with some hackers in Belgrade who have hacked
into our website and caused line saturation of the server by using
`ping' bombardment strategy.

<P>
   The Balkans have a long history of bitter wars, but this is the
first one to be fought out in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The Allies may not be prepared, as yet, to commit ground forces,
but they had no hesitation in sending in the Internet against
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Websites set up by NATO and the British government were
pronounced a great success in the propaganda campaign, with
thousands of calls from Serbian surfers.
</P>
<P>
   The counterattack was swift, sneaky and showed the ruthlessness
of the Yugoslav leader, who has already been compared to Pol Pot by
ministers.
</P>
<P>
   His regime unleashed ``germ warfare'' against the NATO website,
sending in a wave of macro viruses. Then came phase two of the
operation, a specially manufactured program which carpet bombed the
site.
</P>
<P>
   This week the British site, set up by the Ministry of Defense,
with help from the Foreign Office, was reportedly safe from the
``mad hackers'' of the ``Butcher of Belgrade,'' as the tabloids may
put it, and attracting ever-increasing number of callers from
former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The site, led by a team under Richard Davies of the Defense
Information Department, was originally set up last October. From
the March 1 to 20 it received 1,024 calls. After air strikes began
the number climbed to 8,600.
</P>
<P>
   In the 24 hours since it was translated into Serbo-Croat, 1,500
``hits'' came in, 1,400 from former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Assessing the damage to NATO, service spokesman Jamie Shea said
in Brussels: ``Since the 28th of March the service from our
Internet home page has been erratic to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have looked at this very carefully and it seems that we
have been dealing with some hackers in Belgrade who have hacked
into our website and caused line saturation of the server by using
`ping' bombardment strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has also been saturated by one individual who is currently
sending us 2,000 e-mails a day and we are dealing with macro
viruses from Yugoslavia into our e-mail system.''
</P>
<P>
   The information superhighway has emerged as one of the key
weapon in the propaganda war. One of the major Serbian sites is the
home page of the Serbian Ministry of Information, which, among
other things, contains reports on ``Albanian terrorist activity.''

YOUNG BOSNIAN REFUGEE STRUGGLES WITH IMAGES OF THE PAST

 (For release Sunday, April 4)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CELINA OTTAWAY  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ If Anne Frank had survived the Holocaust and
lived to write another diary, she might have struggled with the
same questions that haunt Samira Huremovic.
</P>
<P>
   How do you reclaim a childhood from the rubble of war, the
darkness of hiding, the press of a gun against your chest? How do
you live after a part of you has died?
</P>
<P>
   Samira, 18, arrived in Albany two years ago with her family, the
latest additions to a small but growing Bosnian refugee community.
Her parents took jobs as housekeepers at a local hospital and the
family settled into a nearby second-story flat. Five days after
landing in the States, Samira started school.
</P>
<P>
   It is here in the halls of Albany High School, in the cafeterias
filled with the smell of sweet tomato sauce, in the computer
classes where she studies spread sheets that Samira is finding a
new life after Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   There are some 10 Bosnian refugees in Albany High School, enough
to fill a lunch table. They munch down their pasta, banter in
Bosnian and joke about the latest gossip at school. Samira responds
to the jokes with a smile that rarely reaches her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Their stories are being told all over again today, as President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia seeks to drive out the Muslim
ethnic Albanian population of Kosovo. It was Milosevic, then head
of the dominant Yugoslav state of Serbia, who backed efforts to
create a ``Greater Serbia'' in Samira's homeland, the former
Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
   Samira Huremovic was born in 1980 in Srebrenica,
Bosnia-Herzegovina. She lived in a suburban development just
outside the main town. Her father worked in a battery factory. Her
mother was a housewife.
</P>
<P>
   The Huremovics' house was three stories of concrete block, the
usual building material for the area. Her grandparents lived on the
third floor. Samira shared the second floor with her parents, her
older brother Samir and her younger sister Merdina. The first floor
was a common area.
</P>
<P>
   On the weekends, Samira, Samir and Merdina would wander in the
nearby woods and fields to pick wild strawberries, apples and
cherries. Samira would play volleyball and soccer with her friends.
Boys and girls would play together, something Samira loved.
</P>
<P>
   Even then her brother Samir, four years her senior, looked out
for her. He would tell her to be careful, although he would never
give specifics. He explained that he didn't want other people
talking about her. And he talked vaguely about what it meant to be
a good Muslim girl.
</P>
<P>
   Samira knew what he meant and kept a safe distance from boys.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth grade, she studied biology, chemistry and physics.
She especially loved her biology teacher, a lanky Serb with a long
face and kind eyes. He had a collection of snake skins and bugs in
jars, fascinating stuff to a 10-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   This was peacetime Bosnia. She would play at her Serb friends'
houses and sometimes their mothers would offer her food. The
neighborhood parks were full of the voices of Serbian and Bosnian
children playing together.
</P>
<P>
   The first sign of war was the silence.
</P>
<P>
   One day in 1992, the stores closed. Samira's Serbian neighbors
left. The biology teacher disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't how Samira tells the story.
</P>
<P>
   She starts three years later. She speaks in the same soft voice
that moments before had been giggling about her Leonardo DiCaprio
poster. She starts at the end.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs had been encroaching on Srebrenica for years. Now they
were coming. The Bosnian border patrols had done what they could
and were beating a hasty retreat to woods.
</P>
<P>
   That night Samira and her family left their home and gathered
with their neighbors at a house near her old school. She said
goodbye to her father and brother, who were heading to the woods to
hide with the other men.
</P>
<P>
   We will meet you in Tuzla, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian nationalist soldiers had announced that women and
children would be put on buses. Samira was not sure where they
would be taken. Somewhere in the direction of Tuzla. All night she
and her mother and sister waited. Samira sat awake in the darkness,
wondering what would happen and praying for her father and
brother.In the morning, Serb soldiers rounded them up and started
to herd them onto buses. Samira's mother wrapped a scarf around
Samira's face to disguise her as an old woman. Be quiet, she told
her daughter, don't say a thing.
</P>
<P>
   Samira was 15. She lowered her head. The family approached the
guards. Her mother and sister were allowed to pass.
</P>
<P>
   The guard held his gun up to Samira's chest and blocked her way.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to push her into a group of teen-age girls who were
being separated from their families. Samira started to scream and
reach across the man for her mother. Then, without thinking, she
dropped to the ground and darted underneath the soldier's gun.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, he let her go.
</P>
<P>
   Samira would learn later that two of her cousins had been taken.
One was raped by five men that day.
</P>
<P>
   The buses carried Samira, the older women and the children to
the edge of the Serbian-controlled territory in Bosnia and then
released them deeper into the country. They joined the stream of
refugees on the road to Tuzla. She and her mother and sister walked
all night, careful to keep in the center to avoid land mines. The
road was littered with bodies of those who had fallen from
starvation or exhaustion and died.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuzla, Samira and her family stayed in a refugee camp and
then with the help of relatives settled into a small apartment.
</P>
<P>
   One day as they were eating breakfast at her aunt's house, a man
appeared in the doorway. He was thin, seemingly too thin to be
alive. And he was shorter than the father Samira remembered, as if
two weeks in the woods eating roots and leaves had shrunk him.
</P>
<P>
   They embraced him. Then her mother asked the question that would
become her constant thought.
</P>
<P>
   Where is my son? she said.
</P>
<P>
   Samira's father started to cry. They had been running away from
the Serbs, he said, when another man was shot. Samir went back to
help and got separated in the confusion. That was the last time
Mesan Huremovic saw his son.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Nothing could have prepared us for the horror of Slobodan
Milosevic's attempt to drive out Kosovo's entire non-Serb
population.
</P>
<P>
   He had done it before, to the Muslims in those parts of Bosnia
claimed as Greater Serbia, but the whole point of NATO's bombing
was to deter him from doing it again.
</P>
<P>
   The first aim of Western policy, therefore, has failed. But that
does not mean the policy was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative to threatening military action was to acquiesce
in the slow ``ethnic cleansing'' of Kosovo over a number of years.
This way, the process is crushed into a few weeks, creating a
refugee crisis on a scale not seen since the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   Yes it is a disaster, but at the same time there is now more
hope that the Albanian-speaking people of Kosovo will ultimately
obtain protection, and that Milosevic and his fellow war criminals
will be brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
   The details of the systematic campaign of terror waged by the
Serbian forces are chilling. Accounts of the terrible suffering of
the refugees on the border between Kosovo and Macedonia should be
enough to convict the Serbian leadership of crimes against
humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The deliberate policy of ``identity elimination,'' in which
Kosovar refugees are stripped of their papers while public records
in the towns they have left are destroyed, is frightening.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Kosovars have fled, of course, the difficulty of justly
restoring the preexisting state is multiplied several-fold.
</P>
<P>
   If a guaranteed peace can be brought to Kosovo _ it could take
months or years _ the returning refugees will face all the problems
of recovering property from crooks and impostors with which postwar
Europe was familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, however, it is the scale of the immediate disaster
that should command our attention. The refugees who are lining the
roads out of Kosovo or camped above the snow-line in Macedonia or
huddled in camps and villages in Albania and Montenegro, urgently
need food and shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Our moral obligation is even more pressing than in the case of
natural disasters such as Hurricane Mitch; it was the British (and
American) government's attempt to protect these people that
provoked their enemies and forced them to head for the exits.
</P>
<P>
   We have to feed, clothe and house them, by the roadsides and on
the hillsides to start with. And that is why the government has to
open Britain's doors to our share of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Our duty to the people of Kosovo extends much further than
bombing their tormentors by remote control. &QL;

 ALBANY, N.Y.: x x x saw his son.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   And what of the years before they left Srebrenica?
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Samira's eyes turn red behind her
glasses.``Those were the two hard years of my life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But what is there to say about the starvation? It's dull. It's
monotonous. It's boring.
</P>
<P>
   Samira shrugs her shoulders and stares silently at the wall.
Then she starts, her voice different this time. She speaks lower,
softer, fumbling over the memories.
</P>
<P>
   Her family had lived in the basement of their house for two
years during the war. Samira and her family relied on food rations
from peace forces and when those ran out, they baked bread from
pods they picked off of trees. Her dog Vucko died after a year and
a half. There was nothing to feed him.
</P>
<P>
   There were moments of peace when the residents of Srebrenica
would climb out of their basements. A boy played his guitar and
sang Bosnian pop songs. Samira and her friends would sing along and
dance.
</P>
<P>
   Samira smiled at the boy. He carved her name in his guitar. But
gunshots would drive them back to their basements.
</P>
<P>
   Samira doesn't speak much of her past to her new American
friends in Albany. They don't ask, and she doesn't volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   She and the other Bosnian children don't talk about it much
either.
</P>
<P>
   Instead she talks about the future, her plans for college, the
cute guy she met.
</P>
<P>
   ``I smile and laugh a lot,'' Samira said, walking between
classes. ``Sometimes it makes me feel better. But really I am sad a
lot of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sadness comes out at night. She prays for her brother before
she goes to bed. As she is falling asleep her thoughts are filled
with memories of him.
</P>
<P>
   Samira is careful not to speak of Samir too often in front of
her mother. Four years later, his name brings instant tears to Hata
Huremovic's eyes. When her mother speaks of the war, it is in
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``July 11,'' Hata says when asked about her experiences. ``The
day I lost my son.''
</P>
<P>
   A long pause. ``Thirteen days,'' she says. ``Thirteen days they
walked in the woods.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the numbers that hold back Samira's laugh at the lunch
table. Thoughts of her brother dancing with her in the basement
haunt her. His face wakes her when she sleeps.
</P>
<P>
   In between lessons, she logs on to the Internet and searches for
information about Bosnian refugees. In front of the computer,
Samira seems to come alive, shoulders thrust forward in
anticipation, foot tapping out the moments till Bosnia.com's Web
site appears on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   The logo appears. Samira's face breaks into a smile. She combs
through the pages, looking for her brother.

SLAYING SHATTERS ILLUSION OF ECUADOR AS A SAFE HAVEN FROM REGION'S
POLITICAL VIOLENCE

<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador _ Tires sometimes are burned and Molotov
cocktails are tossed in the heat of anti-government protests, but
that's as violent as things usually get in Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike neighboring Colombia and Peru, this South American nation
of 12 million people has never been plagued by savage death squads,
powerful guerrilla armies or drug-cartel terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the murder of Jaime Hurtado, a 62-year-old Marxist
congressman, has left Ecuadoreans baffled.
</P>
<P>
   Hurtado, his alternate deputy and his bodyguard were gunned down
in broad daylight two blocks from the Congress building Feb, 17 in
Quito. As Hurtado lay bleeding to death on the rain-soaked
sidewalk, the assassin fled to Colombia, authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   The Ecuadorean government blames Colombia's paramilitaries _
right-wing mercenaries involved in that country's long-running
civil war _ for the deaths of the three men. Others suspect
Ecuadorean police officers played a role.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter who ordered the hit, analysts say, Hurtado's
assassination shattered the illusion of Ecuador as a safe haven
from the region's political violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this can happen to a congressman, it can happen to
anyone,'' said Lenin Hurtado, Jaime Hurtado's son.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually unknown abroad, Hurtado was one of Ecuador's most
militant opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Born to illiterate parents, he grew up in an impoverished
village on the Pacific coast. With the help of an athletic
scholarship, he studied in the port city of Guayaquil and became a
lawyer. He was elected to Congress in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   A fervent Marxist, he founded the Popular Democratic Movement,
known by its Spanish initials MPD, which was closely linked to
Ecuador's clandestine Communist Party. He named his son after
Vladimir Lenin and christened one of his daughters Stalina.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one had the charisma or the influence with the masses that
Jaime Hurtado had,'' said MPD leader Ciro Guzman. ``He was the most
important revolutionary of the Ecuadorean left in the last 20
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Ecuadorean Marxists never posed a serious threat to the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Leftist guerrilla groups such as Alfaro Vive Carajo were
dismantled by the end of the 1980s. A band of radical students
called the Popular Combatants tossed a stick of dynamite at the
U.S. Embassy in Quito last year, but few people paid attention.
</P>
<P>
   Hurtado was never linked to any of these groups.
</P>
<P>
   He did, however, admire the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC, Colombia's largest Marxist rebel group,
according to his son, Lenin. When the FARC opened peace talks with
the Colombian government Jan. 7, rebel leaders invited Jaime
Hurtado to the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   That may have drawn the attention of paramilitaries, the
right-wing death squads that target guerrillas and their supporters
in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Aguirre, one of two suspects awaiting trial on
charges related to Hurtado's death, told police that paramilitaries
ordered the assassination, because they believed the congressman
was providing logistical support to the FARC.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the FARC has expanded operations into
Colombia's southern Putumayo state on the Ecuadorean border. The
guerrilla organization, which funds its insurgency, in part, by
abducting people for ransom, receives guns and uniforms through
Ecuador and often stashes kidnapping victims on the Ecuadorean side
of the border. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The Colombia-Ecuador border region became even more important
to FARC leaders following military setbacks along their country's
frontier with Panama, another popular gun-running route, according
to Eduardo Pizarro, a guerrilla expert at the National University
in the Colombian capital of Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Colombian paramilitary units started migrating
toward the Ecuadorean border in pursuit of the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Castano, the leader of Colombia's main paramilitary
umbrella organization, told the Bogota newspaper El Tiempo last
month that one of his fronts includes 70 Ecuadoreans and is
stationed near the border.
</P>
<P>
   An anonymous group that ``supports'' the paramilitaries killed
Hurtado and would continue to operate in Ecuador, Castano said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally think that it probably was the paramilitaries''
who killed Hurtado, said one source close to the Ecuadorean police
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   If true, the assassination would mark the first paramilitary
attack in Ecuador and a widening of the Colombian conflict, which
has already spilled into Panama and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Paramilitaries have raided Panamanian villages and have gone
after Colombian guerrillas who kidnap and blackmail ranchers in
Venezuela. The troubles along the Colombia-Ecuador frontier have
prompted the Quito government to station 5,000 troops on its side
of the border.
</P>
<P>
   But some people insist that it would make little sense for
Colombian paramilitaries to target Hurtado.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would they be that worried about Jaime Hurtado?'' asked a
Western diplomat. ``Given all the domestic support that the FARC
has in Colombia, any support provided by Hurtado wouldn't have been
all that important.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Hurtado's radical views, his colleagues say that he
channeled his energies into electoral politics rather than armed
struggle. They suspect that disgruntled officers within the
Ecuadorean police force may have been involved in his death.
</P>
<P>
   Elsie Monge, a human rights activist in Quito, said Hurtado may
have earned the wrath of the police by promoting peasant takeovers
of land and by organizing anti-government street protests that
occasionally turned violent.
</P>
<P>
   Hurtado ``was not a threat, but he was a permanent nuisance,''
Monge said. ``He was always questioning the power structure and the
exploitation of workers and peasants.''
</P>
<P>
   Ecuadorean police have denied involvement in the crime. But
Lenin Hurtado said that shoddy police work immediately after his
father's killing has raised questions.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting occurred near the Congress and Supreme Court
buildings, which were teeming with security guards and police. The
mortally wounded Hurtado lay on the sidewalk for 15 minutes before
help arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman _ a Colombian known as Victorino _ boarded a
commercial flight to Colombia five hours after the crime, according
to police. One of the prime suspects, who might have shed more
light on the assassination, was gunned down by Ecuadorean police in
his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Aguirre, who remains in prison on charges connected
to the triple slaying, is a longtime police informant as well as a
former informant for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
Aguirre admits that he was involved in the crime but claims that he
tried to back out at the last minute and that he tipped off police
hours before the assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of intimidating leftists, Hurtado's death appears to
have galvanized them.
</P>
<P>
   Still angry about the killing, Hurtado's political party helped
mount a nationwide strike last month. Protesters clashed with
police, blocked traffic and forced the government to lower gasoline
prices and back down on other economic austerity measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a certain sense,'' said the Western diplomat, referring to
Hurtado, ``he's far more threatening dead than he was alive.''

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Chewable supplement can help women get the
calcium they need
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Chocolate is an essential part of a balanced diet.
</P>
<P>
   Really.
</P>
<P>
   That is, if it contains a hefty dose of calcium, as does Viactiv
Soft Calcium Chews, a new product that delivers 500 milligrams of
calcium concealed by chewy chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Ewww, you say. But the chews _ which come in two flavors, Milk
Chocolate and Mochaccino, actually taste pretty good. They're
certainly not Godiva, but Godiva chocolate has a lot more than 20
calories and 0.5 grams of fat per piece, which is all each chew
contains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look like medicine, it doesn't taste like
medicine,'' said Dr. Nelson Watts, director of the osteoporosis
program at the Emory Clinic (Emory University, Atlanta).
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, calcium tablets, the most common supplementary
form, often taste unpleasantly chalky.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get a positive sensation when you put it in your
mouth,'' said Connie Weaver, who heads the department of foods and
nutrition at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver, who spoke on behalf of Viactiv's manufacturer, said the
product is ``a revolutionary concept to address those issues'' and
will encourage more women to consume adequate amounts of calcium.
</P>
<P>
   Mead Johnson Nutritionals, a division of the pharmaceutical
company Bristol-Myers Squibb, came up with the idea for Viactiv _
combining something many women crave with something many women need
_ after research indicated the vast majority of women older than 35
don't get enough daily calcium.
</P>
<P>
   Calcium deficiency puts people, especially older white women, at
greater risk for osteoporosis, a disease in which the bones become
extremely brittle and susceptible to fractures.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors recommend that premenopausal adult women and
postmenopausal women who are taking estrogen should consume 1,000
milligrams of calcium per day, Watts said. That includes calcium
consumed via natural dietary sources, such as dairy products and
leafy green vegetables, so these women don't necessarily have to
take 1,000 milligrams of supplemental calcium.
</P>
<P>
   Women who are postmenopausal but not taking hormone replacement
therapy should consume 1,500 milligrams of calcium per day, Watts
said.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no evidence to suggest that dietary calcium is
superior to supplemental calcium, doctors would prefer people to
consume their daily calcium requirements through their diet.
They've learned that's unlikely, however, because even though dairy
foods are the best source of calcium, many adults are either
lactose intolerant or have fallen out of the habit of drinking
milk.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your habit has been to follow a diet that's not providing
adequate calcium, it's unlikely you're going to change your diet
radically enough to correct your calcium deficiency,'' Watts said.
</P>
<P>
   People who have trouble digesting calcium carbonate should be
aware that Viactiv does contain this form of calcium. One solution
is to eat Viactiv with meals, or to try alternative forms of
calcium supplements such as calcium citrate.
</P>
<P>
   Calcium is generally better absorbed with food, so ideally
people should take supplements with meals. Those taking more than
one supplement per day should try to space them out. However, as
Weaver said, the important thing is to remember to take them in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the only time you'll remember to take a supplement is in
the morning, take it in the morning,'' Weaver said. ``But if you
can remember, space it out more so you'll absorb it more
efficiently.''
</P>
<P>
   Viactiv retails for $1.49-$1.89 for a 12-pack or $6.69-$7.99 for
a canister of 60, slightly more expensive than other calcium
carbonate supplements. By comparison, a 100-count bottle of 500
milligram calcium pills costs about $6.99.

YOUR PRIVACY RIGHT MAY HAVE TO GIVE WAY TO PUBLIC GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The right to privacy is something most of think of as a
guarantee, one protected by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before the Internet, before personal information
became a commodity that is routinely bought and sold, before data
mining became a national pasttime.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phone conversations can be snatched from thin air. E-mail
correspondence is an open book for employers or clever hackers.
Marketers plunder databanks looking for information they can use to
sell you things. Even financial and medical records have unnerving
ways of getting on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy in the information age is increasingly difficult to
protect, let alone guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an exaggeration to say we're totally surrounded by
computers, and that computers watch everything we do,'' said Amitai
Etzioni, a George Washington University professor and former
adviser to the White House who explores how privacy rights and
responsibilities intersect in his book ``The Limits of Privacy''
(Basic Books, 1999, $25).
</P>
<P>
   ``We all currently live under the illusion that information
about us is stored in separate databanks,'' he said. ``In fact,
those databanks are all becoming linked into one overpowering
databank. In the 21st century, we will need to keep a very watchful
eye on how information about us is used and how it can be abused.''
</P>
<P>
   But the explosion of information about us has a potential
benefit as well. And it has raised a new kind of privacy question:
Given that we can now get information in ways previously never
imagined, does society have a responsibility to override privacy in
the interest of the common good?
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the right to privacy collides with a major public
health or safety question, Etzioni said. Society needs to take a
``communitarian'' view of privacy, which means balancing rights
with responsibilities. In some cases, there may be a compelling
reason to invade someone's privacy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Medical records, for example, offer a classic case for debating
the right to privacy vs. the public good.
</P>
<P>
   Most people agree that unauthorized use of records is a
violation of privacy. If someone opens a file he's not supposed to
see and releases information he's not supposed to have, that's a
violation of privacy, Etzioni said. ``Most of those are isolated
incidents, and clearly an unauthorized use of information.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more concerning, however, is a less visible, but much more
widespread problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've found is there's a huge amount of authorized abuse
of medical information,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Employers, for example, are frequently able to glean sensitive
health information about their employees in legal ways.
</P>
<P>
   While it's easy to see the harm that goes with such violations
of privacy, there also are cases in which protecting an
individual's medical privacy has a large social cost.
</P>
<P>
   Routine testing of infants for HIV, for example, offers a chance
to save lives. But it also violates the privacy of the mothers,
since it discloses the HIV status of the mother as well as the
infant.
</P>
<P>
   Society needs to have good criteria for determining when a
social good is more important than an individual's privacy. We
should only take steps to limit privacy if there is a serious and
well-documented problem. If withholding private information creates
a serious danger to the lives of others, for example, then society
has an obligation to consider using it.
</P>
<P>
   ``For infants with HIV, this is a no-brainer,'' Etzioni said.
Early treatment of infants identified as HIV-positive at birth can
reduce their chances of dying from AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   A second factor to consider is whether the problem can be solved
some other way.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no other way to solve the problem without violating
someone's privacy, then you must find the least intrusive way to
collect the information.
</P>
<P>
   In certain industries, such as transportation, mandatory drug
testing is essential for public safety, he said. In the past, this
required people to produce urine samples in the presence of a
witness to ensure no one tried to cheat the test by substituting a
clean sample. This test can be made less invasive, however, by
simply measuring the temperature of the sample, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy is a right in our society, and one we need to protect.
But we also have to consider its costs.
</P>
<P>
   Information is giving us increasingly powerful tools, ones we're
just learning how to use, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Protecting information is important. But so is using it
responsibly.

MCCUMBER'S `COWBOY WAY' LASSOS THE REALITY OF '90S LIFE ON THE
RANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cowboy has the timeless allure of the tall skies of the
West. There may be no more lasting image of this region than those
lonely figures astride their horses crossing the vast landscape,
that romantic vision of freedom and solitude kept alive by
countless Western films, songs and, unfortunately, Marlboro ads.
</P>
<P>
   But David McCumber wondered if that image matched the reality of
a cowboy's life in the late 1990s. As the 46-year-old writer said
in a recent interview, ``I've always been interested in where the
Hollywood myth and the Montana reality of the cowboy intersected.
And the only way to find that, it seemed to me, was to go out and
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   So McCumber, an award-winning journalist but an admitted
greenhorn of the first rank, signed on as a hand at a sprawling
Montana ranch 85 miles from his home in Livingston. He then spent
10 months doing the drudge work of hard labor and long hours. His
ranch time (precious little of it spent in the saddle) has resulted
in a fascinating new book, ``The Cowboy Way'' (Avon/Bard, 337
pages, $24).
</P>
<P>
   This is a keenly observed slice of ranch life today, a
hardscrabble antidote to cowboy myth. But McCumber's book is also a
quiet-spoken, even poetic hymn to the Western landscape, amid its
changing seasons and the camaraderie of those who still make their
living in the outdoors using their hands.
</P>
<P>
   It is a journey of many discoveries for a man who had spent much
of his life behind a desk as a writer and editor at newspapers and
magazines throughout the West, including founding Montana's ``Big
Sky Journal,'' which celebrates its state. Gone were McCumber's
days of management meetings and news-story decisions, replaced by
shoveling out stalls and caring for cattle, often with an intimacy
that seems almost parental.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began to understand, by example and the lack of it,''
McCumber writes, ``the real cowboy ethos: Don't duck out on your
share of work. Don't make somebody else clean up your mistakes.
Take care of the animals and your fellow hands.''
</P>
<P>
   McCumber's account is written in first-person, but it is a
subdued first-person, by design. His focus remains squarely on the
ranch and its people, his subject rather than himself _ just as he
did in his well-received previous book that traced the
cross-country travels of a pool hustler, ``Playing Off the Rail.''
</P>
<P>
   That is because McCumber is a diligent observer, not a
dilettante, a writer committed to immersing himself in an
unfamiliar world in order to understand and portray its subculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immersing yourself is an invaluable way of gathering detail _
that's what floats the boat,'' McCumber observed. ``I enjoy finding
out everything about something and then communicating that to
people. That's the best way of reporting, whether you're covering
baseball or government. My particular pleasure is in finding little
pieces of the culture that may not be readily accessible to
everybody, but can be experienced. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``But as a good friend once said to me, `The problem with
first-person reporting, in the George Plimpton model, is that it
comes in three flavors _ me, me and me.' I think you've got to
avoid that. Even though I'm writing in the first person, I'm trying
to write more about the world I am experiencing.''
</P>
<P>
   The cowboy world is not for the faint of heart or physique. The
long hours and hard labor lopped 40 pounds off McCumber's lanky
frame. And there was many an evening when he fell asleep with his
head on his laptop while compiling notes on the day's experiences
in the old blue trailer that served as his bunkhouse.
</P>
<P>
   His fondness for the ranch life, even with the hardships, still
is evident when McCumber talks about it many months afterward. It
is obvious that what started as a story ended up being a
life-altering experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out that I could do some things I never thought I
could, which is a pretty good thing to learn in the middle of
life,'' McCumber said. ``I found out that I could work using my
hands and my back, whether it was doing auto mechanics, mending
fences or baling hay. That gave me a real sense of accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also taught me that there are different ways of looking at
things. I am an environmentalist, a fairly ardent one, and I found
out that ranchers are also environmentalists _ they have to be;
they're in the grass business. The experience also taught me how
there are incredibly wonderful aspects of the cowboy life. There is
a lot of drudgery, backbreaking work, but also a transcendent joy.
Having fished and hiked and bird hunted, I thought I understood the
outdoors. But you can't truly understand the outdoors until you
have worked a piece of land. That's a much more profound experience
than recreating on it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCumber already has completed the experience that will be the
subject of his next book. He rescued an Edsel from a Montana farm
field and proceeded to drive it 20,000 miles on two-lane roads
around the outer edges of the United States. Mechanical problems
were surprisingly few, McCumber related, though the Edsel did
consume 280 quarts of oil.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles is all show-business people,'' said Macdonald.

MCCAIN REJECTS WHITE HOUSE POLICY ON KEY-RECOVERY SYSTEMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Vt., Mont., Ore.)  (mk) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a surprising about-face, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said this
week that he was abandoning his support for the Clinton
administration's policy requiring that law enforcement agencies be
given keys enabling them to unlock scrambled data.
</P>
<P>
   The switch by McCain, who heads the Senate Commerce Committee,
is almost certain to stand the government's encryption policy on
its head, killing both the administration's demands for so-called
key-recovery systems for police agencies and its restrictions on
what kinds of encryption products U.S. software developers can
export.
</P>
<P>
   McCain announced this week that he would join Sens. Conrad
Burns, R-Mont.; Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and Ron Wyden, D-Ore., in
sponsoring a bill that would replace the administration's current
prohibitions on the export of strong encryption with a review
process that would give the software and computer industries a
strong voice in what technologies could be shipped overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Key-recovery systems are being pushed by the FBI, the National
Security Agency and other federal law enforcement agencies, which
argue that advances in encryption technology will make it
increasingly difficult for police and intelligence agents to
monitor the computer communications of suspected terrorists and
other criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, that concern is focused mainly on e-mail and other
digital documents sent over the Internet. But increasingly,
telecommunications of all kinds, including simple telephone calls,
will use Internet technologies, making traditional wiretaps all but
impossible without keys to unscramble conversations.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. software industry has argued that the restrictions put
American companies at a disadvantage for no good reason, since any
criminal who wanted to scramble data could simply use an advanced
encryption product produced in a foreign country.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates oppose the government's policy, arguing that
only strong encryption can guarantee personal privacy in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The administration declined to comment Friday on the proposed
bill, which has not yet been filed, until a copy was available.
</P>
<P>
   The about-face for McCain, who is widely believed to be testing
the waters for a presidential bid, is significant in that it brings
together Senate leaders who last session sponsored opposing bills
on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Burns, Leahy and Wyden have staunchly opposed key-recovery
programs. McCain, on the other hand, last session sponsored a bill
with Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., that would have required key recovery
on all federally financed computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's office said the legislation would be filed when
Congress returns on April 11 from a two-week spring recess. David
Crane, an aide to McCain on the Commerce Committee, said the
senator hoped to move the bill to the floor quickly after that.
</P>
<P>
   While the McCain proposal does not go as far as a House bill
that would lift all export controls on encryption, the computer
industry and privacy advocates cautiously applauded it as having
the potential to break a years-long deadlock with the White House
over encryption policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think on balance, it is a very encouraging development,''
said David Sobel of the Electronic Privacy Information Center,
which has staunchly opposed key-recovery programs as an intrusion
on the privacy of computer users.
</P>
<P>
   Sobel said he was pleasantly surprised by McCain's shift in
position. ``The only thing I can speculate on is that his
presidential ambition has made him more sensitive to the business
concerns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others said they saw the shift as simply a broader recognition
in Congress of the need for change.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Holleyman, president of the Business Software Alliance,
said it was ``becoming increasingly clear that the number of
policy-makers who support modernizing export control policy for
encryption products is growing, not shrinking.''
</P>
<P>
   The strength of encryption software is measured in the number of
bits _ ones or zeroes _ that make up the ``key'' used to scramble
the data. As the keys become longer, breaking the encryption
becomes exponentially more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Export
Administration, which oversees the administration's encryption
policies, requires that makers of data-scrambling products stronger
than 56 bits show that they are developing key recovery systems
that would give law enforcement agencies easy back-door access to
scrambled data.
</P>
<P>
   Although in the last year the administration has eased those
requirements for some industries, primarily financial services,
many common software products cannot be exported.
</P>
<P>
   Crane said the proposed legislation would replace the
administration's current licensing process with a review board
tilted in industry's favor and would lift all restrictions on
exporting encryption under 64 bits to friendly nations. The review
board could grant exceptions for nonmilitary products stronger than
64 bits if they were ``generally and publicly available,'' Crane
said.
</P>
<P>
   The president would ultimately have the authority to override
any exemptions granted by the board, citing national security.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the House bill, there is no provision that would make it
illegal to use encryption while committing a crime.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the midst of the political crisis surrounding the
killing of Amadou Diallo by four plainclothes police officers, New
York City's police commissioner, Howard Safir, sped across the
country in a corporate jet, spent the night in a $700 Beverly Hills
hotel suite and schmoozed with biggies at the Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   As might have been predicted, he was lambasted _ by editorial
writers and some public officials, who asserted that his trip
trivialized the shooting. But Safir was upholding a longstanding
tradition that came with his job: Upon becoming commissioner, he
had automatically joined the social A list, with all its
blandishments and career-threatening temptations. Like many of his
predecessors, Safir flits from opera premieres at Lincoln Center
(he showed up at ``Lizzie Borden'' on opening night) to black-tie
galas at midtown hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the situation in almost any other city in the United
States, the appointment to police commissioner in New York elevates
a onetime beat officer to a social stratosphere where the air _ and
the trophy wives _ are thinner than ether. Befriended by powerful
business executives who prize close connections to the police force
and celebrated by a city that embraces its noir crime lore, New
York's commissioners are regulars on the party circuit. William
Bratton, Safir's predecessor, even kept extra uniforms on hand at
all times: two pressed dinner jackets, one in his office and one at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Bratton, who left the department in 1996, in part because of
questions about his acceptance of gifts of expensive travel,
remains a fixture on the social scene. He is invited to operas,
movie premieres and Oscar parties. ``But now I have to pay for the
tickets,'' he said. ``And I have the luxury of saying no.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Nachman, an expert on law enforcement-press relations who
lectures at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Va., regularly compares
notes with the police chiefs of most big American cities. He said
New York's treatment of its police commissioner is unique. ``It's
the only job in the world where, overnight, you go from clip-on
ties to Hermes ties,'' said Nachman, who is also a former editor of
The New York Post. (Police officers and officials, he noted, wear
clip-on ties so they can't be used against them as impromptu
lariats.) ``Soigne New York cleaves to its police commissioner in a
way no other city does,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bratton said that when he was police commissioner in Boston, he
was invited to fewer society events ``and more church socials and
more events in one-story concrete buildings.'' In New York, he
said, the commissioner goes to church socials and VFW picnics, but
is also expected to attend black-tie parties and to mingle with the
socially connected.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner's reputation is burnished by the fact that the
Police Foundation, a charity that raises money for Crime Stoppers
and other police-related programs, attracts social and business
luminaries. Members of the board include Lew Rudin, the real-estate
developer; Richard Grasso, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange,
and Robin L. Farkas, a former chairman of Alexander's department
store.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Police Foundation draws the corporate community in a big
way, and with that comes the social,'' said Gregg Roberts, a vice
president of the foundation. The annual black-tie (or dress
uniform) dinner in February at Police Headquarters at 1 Police
Plaza costs $600 a plate. ``And it's a lot more fun than those
rubber-chicken dinners at the Plaza those guys are used to,''
Roberts said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Safir has close ties to the corporate community, including a
friendship with George Fellows, the president of Revlon, whose
guest he was at the Oscars. It is not clear whether that friendship
stems from Revlon's ties to the Police Department. (MacAndrews &AMP;
Forbes, the company that controls 83 percent of Revlon, employs
off-duty uniformed officers to guard its offices, and Ronald O.
Perelman, the owner of Mac-Andrews &AMP; Forbes, has a personal
security chief who was a deputy commissioner under Safir.) Safir's
trip is the subject of an ethics inquiry; he has said he did
nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Some accounts trace the origins of the socialite police
commissioner to Theodore Roosevelt. According to ``T.R.: The Last
Romantic'' (Basic Books, 1997), the social ascendancy of
commissioners began with Roosevelt in 1895, the year of his
appointment. He was out every night.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, being New York City police commissioner was by no
means a springboard to social prominence,'' said H.W. Brands, the
author of ``T.R.'' ``But the members of the Roosevelt family were
established members of New York society. So Roosevelt would go out
for dinner every night with his society friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt's peers ``all thought he was eccentric,'' Brands said,
but, he added, ``since then, the police commissioner's job has
taken on something of a social value.'' In other cities, the
commissioner's job is less geared toward society hobnobbing. In
Boston, said Sgt. Margot Hill, a Police Department spokeswoman,
Commissioner Paul Evans wouldn't think of watching the Oscars, let
alone attending them. ``If you said `Oscars' to him, he'd think of
Felix Unger's roommate,'' she said. ``If you were to do a story on
his social outings, you'd fall asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert W. McNeilly Jr., Pittsburgh's police commissioner, said
he was rarely invited to swanky social functions. But he said he
hoped to establish a police foundation similar to New York City's.
``And with that, I imagine that I, too, will have to be more
involved with the kinds of organizations and groups who are big
donors,'' he said. He would have to buy a dinner jacket, because he
doesn't own one.
</P>
<P>
   A prominent hostess who divides her time between New York and
Palm Beach, Fla., said that the sheriff of Palm Beach _ the
equivalent of the police commissioner _ is treated more like the
help than a potential dinner guest.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's because there's so much to buy from the police
commissioner of New York,'' she said, adding, sotto voce: ``Parking
permits.'' She was referring to the plastic police-issue cards that
some privileged New Yorkers, for reasons of security or by virtue
of great connections, place on their car dashboards so they can
park virtually anywhere. (In fact, they are not for sale.)
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Mode, Safir's spokeswoman, had no comment about his
status as a socialite, nor would she discuss whether he had
exchanged clip-on ties for Hermes.
</P>
<P>
   But Bratton said: ``Hermes ties? I'd say I have quite a few of
them.''

TINY TERRORIST BEETLES GOBBLE THE GREENS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., British Columbia)   By CASS PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the best things to happen to salads in decades is that
zippy Italian green called arugula. It's literally a weed in Italy,
and it would grow just as easily in anybody's garden if not for one
tiny problem: the flea beetle.
</P>
<P>
   Flea beetles are minuscule black insects that appear early in
the spring and spend the rest of the season leaping among the
plants, chewing holes in leaves. They hop like fleas, hence the
common name. If there are enough of them, they can nibble seedlings
to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there are several species of flea beetles. Some prefer
nightshade family plants like eggplant and tomatoes, and some
prefer cabbage family plants like broccoli and arugula. In my
garden, the cabbage-eaters are more numerous, and they adore
arugula.
</P>
<P>
   If I sow arugula seeds in early spring, to take advantage of the
cool weather they like, I have to swathe the spot in one of those
diaphanous row covers immediately, before the seeds germinate. If I
don't, the flea beetles will chomp the seedlings into oblivion the
moment the first leaves peek above the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the flea beetles know the arugula is there. They alight
on the protective cover, patiently waiting for me to lift it to
snag a bunch of arugula, so they can sneak in and start munching. I
imagine saliva dripping from their little jaws.
</P>
<P>
   It is no comfort to know that this pest is an accidental import,
like the European corn borer, the Japanese beetle and the gypsy
moth. Flea beetles are thought to have arrived in North America in
the early 1900s, probably from Europe or Asia.
</P>
<P>
   They got off the boat in British Columbia and made their way
steadily eastward. The North American countryside is rich in
cabbage family weeds like yellow rocket and winter cress, and the
flea beetles flourished.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny terrorists arrived in the Northeast in the 1950s and
have spent the last half-century establishing themselves as garden
pests, as if anyone needed more of those. Several mild winters in a
row have made the problem even worse by allowing more flea beetles
to survive.
</P>
<P>
   What's a gardener to do?
</P>
<P>
   At a conference in New Haven this winter, research scientists
and organic farmers pondered the perplexing problem of Phyllotreta
cruciferae, the cabbage-crunching flea beetle, as well as its
nightshade-noshing cousins.
</P>
<P>
   Not much research has been done on the agile insects, because
they are not a big problem for conventional vegetable growers.
(Pesticides applied to kill other insects tend to keep flea beetles
in check.) For organic growers and most backyard gardeners, though,
they are tough to control.
</P>
<P>
   Like other beetles, they are hard-bodied. They also bound away
at the slightest disturbance. Those characteristics put them out of
reach of most botanical pesticides and even the chemicals commonly
available for home use, because the pesticide has to touch the
insects to kill them.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from keeping the beetles' favorite foods under cover,
farmers reported trying _ with limited success _ to repel them with
garlic and hot pepper sprays, planting cabbage family crops among
aromatic herbs and vacuuming the insects off their crops with leaf
blowers adapted to work in reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Some tried to snare the flea beetles on sticky traps: pieces of
white or yellow poster board taped to bamboo sticks and coated with
a gooey product called Tangle-Trap. Flea beetles are attracted to
white and yellow, and they paste themselves to the traps in
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Stoner, an entomologist at the Connecticut Agricultural
Experiment Station in New Haven, tried baiting sticky traps with
mustard oil, the substance that cabbage-loving flea beetles home in
on when they're looking for their favorite snack plants. The baited
traps worked, perhaps too well. ``I suspect that they attract many
more beetles than they trap,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Those tempted to try this at home should be warned that
concentrated mustard oil can make eyes water and burn skin.
</P>
<P>
   Repellent sprays, traps and covers are usually enough to keep
flea beetles from doing fatal damage to crops like broccoli,
turnips and rutabagas, but nothing can keep them from making
unattractive holes in leafy greens like arugula and mizuna, a mild
Japanese mustard that's also splendid in salads.
</P>
<P>
   For now, there is only one solution to the flea beetle problem:
grow the most vulnerable crops in the fall. Flea beetles run
roughshod over the garden until autumn, when they stop reproducing
and start looking for a cozy place to spend the winter _ in the
soil, fallen leaves or a grassy spot. From September until hard
freeze, the arugula is pristine.
</P>
<P>
   What do Italians do about flea beetles in the arugula? Nothing.
The beetles aren't considered a big problem in Europe, suggesting
that they made it to North America unaccompanied by the natural
predators that keep them in check in their native lands. A European
study found that up to 90 percent of wintering flea beetles of the
arugula-munching variety had been killed by beneficial nematodes,
tiny soil-dwelling worms.

FOUR FUND MANAGERS WHO USED TECH STOCKS TO WIN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Many mutual fund managers eked out small gains in the quarter
just ended, with the average domestic diversified equity fund
returning just 1.26 percent, according to Morningstar Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But funds in the technology sector broke out of the pack,
averaging returns of 16.35 percent. And some diversified stock
funds also leaped to the top rankings because of holdings in
Internet, cable and telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
   The managers of four of the highest-ranked funds talked about
what drove their performance and looked ahead to the rest of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Bargains and Branches
</P>
<P>
   ``Our theme is how the Internet is changing our lives,'' said
Garrett Van Wagoner, who runs the $286.8 million Van Wagoner
Emerging Growth fund, the top American diversified stock fund for
the quarter, up 55.84 percent. (He also runs the category's No. 2
and 3 funds, Van Wagoner Micro-Cap and Van Wagoner Mid-Cap,
respectively.) ``People are hooking up on line, causing a
tremendous amount of data traffic growth across the country, and
many different technology sectors are benefiting from the
explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   His top ranking marks a sharp turnaround from his poor returns
in 1997 and early 1998. Van Wagoner said he had concentrated the
portfolio into just 45 stocks, but reversed course last March,
bringing the fund up to 115 stocks.
</P>
<P>
   After last year's stock market selloff, Van Wagoner bought some
semiconductor and communications stocks at bargain prices,
including RF Micro Devices and Transwitch. They proved to be big
winners in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   He also posted strong profits from telecommunications companies
that are competing with the old-line telephone companies. Among
these are Metromedia Fiber Network, which lays fiber strands in
metropolitan areas and sells capacity to providers of
telecommunications services, and Allegiance Telecom, which sells
bundled telecommunications services.
</P>
<P>
   Van Wagoner has also been attracted by the content side of the
Internet. His biggest holding, a top performer this quarter, is
Onhealth Network, which runs a Web site that provides health and
fitness information. He is not taking profits on the stock, which
he says ``has a long way to go.'' But he is trimming some of those
other first-quarter winners, ``not because we think something is
wrong, but to be prudent,'' he said. ``Trees don't grow to the
sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by Biotechnology
</P>
<P>
   Neal Miller, who runs the $1.87 billion Fidelity New Millennium
fund, also went on a shopping spree after last year's market slump.
The fund rose 24.54 percent for the quarter, earning eighth place
among domestic diversified equity funds.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the performance came from biotechnology stocks. ``After
the honeymoon period with biotech companies eight years ago, they
have languished as a category,'' he said. ``Now, selective
companies are making great advances.'' One favorite is Immunex
Corp., which makes an arthritis drug recently approved by the Food
and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   He also made money in semiconductor capital equipment concerns,
which are recovering from the Asian economic crisis. ``Now, people
need more storage and faster products at the same time that fewer
people are producing them,'' he said. One favorite is Micron
Technology, which he said had tripled its market share.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet front, Miller likes CMGI Inc., a technology
investment company that helped develop Lycos and Geocities. Another
favorite is Real Networks, the leading maker of software that lets
computer users send and receive audio, video and other multimedia
services on the Web. ``Anything involving entertainment on the
Internet will probably use their product,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Cable-Cellular Mix
</P>
<P>
   Cable television stocks helped propel the $526.5 million WM
Trust II Growth fund into 12th place among American diversified
stock funds in the first quarter, with a return of 23.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cable companies will be able to dramatically improve their
basic cable, video and TV offerings as they move from analog to
digital networks,'' said the fund's manager, Warren Lammert, adding
that they would be able to enter new businesses like voice
telephony and ``always on,'' or continuously connected, Internet
services.
</P>
<P>
   Among his favorite stocks are Time Warner and United
International Holdings, which owns cable systems in Europe, Latin
America and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Lammert's biggest bet is in technology stocks, and his biggest
such holding is Nokia, an industry leader in cellular phone and
network equipment, which he said ``is benefiting from the growth in
cellular use.''
</P>
<P>
   His performance was also bolstered by Internet stocks (15
percent of the portfolio), particularly the bookseller Amazon.com,
as well as At Home and Excite, which are planning to merge. At Home
provides Internet services in partnership with cable companies;
Excite is the No. 2 Internet portal, after Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Looking Beyond the Net
</P>
<P>
   Despite its name, the Munder Net Net fund, which ranked third in
the first quarter among technology sector funds, with a gain of
54.10 percent, is not a pure Internet fund. ``We buy companies that
derive revenue or strategic significance from the Internet,'' said
Paul Cook, manager of the fund, which has $1.45 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   The fund invests, for example, in Ameritrade, which has a
successful online trading operation as well as a profitable
off-line brokerage business. On-line trading, Cook said, ``has a
lot of momentum because people are successful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But if the market reverses,'' he added, ``they might look for
investment help off line.''
</P>
<P>
   The portfolio also includes investments in electronic commerce,
which he expects to increase to 10 to 15 percent of all retailing
over the next 5 to 10 years; it now accounts for less than 1
percent. He particularly likes America Online, ``because the
relationships and deals it has struck with other e-commerce
partners make it a diversified way to get at the e-commerce
trends.''
</P>
<P>
   He also likes Verticalnet Inc., which creates Web sites that
provide information and online communication for various
industries.

SOME FUND MANAGERS FIND NEEDLES IN GLOBAL HAYSTACK

   South Korean beer. Japanese pinball. A globe-trotting British
cybergame adventuress who wears tight T-shirts and packs two
pistols.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign companies that make these products are small and
diverse, off the radar screens of many American investors. But the
forces behind the strong gains in their shares help explain why
international small-capitalization funds were an outstanding global
fund category in the first three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Among portfolio managers who specialize in buying shares of
foreign companies, the most successful in the first quarter were
those who had researched and cherry-picked their way through
lesser-known equities, especially the stocks hurt by the
persistence of the Asian economic crisis and Japan's deep
recession. While international stock funds as a group rose 2.54
percent in the quarter, many small-cap international funds had
double-digit gains.
</P>
<P>
   These funds are volatile by nature and not for everyone. Many
suffered large losses when the Asian crisis began in mid-1997, and,
of course, it is unclear whether the advances in the most recent
quarter are sustainable.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how managers at three such funds view some of their
favorite stocks:
</P>
<P>
   Profits After a Fire Sale
</P>
<P>
   At the Oakmark International Small Cap fund, David Herro is
heavily invested in Asia, Australia and New Zealand. He said he
began to build up positions in those countries during the third
quarter of 1997; although the fund fell nearly 20 percent that
year, it rose 9.2 percent in 1998 and 24.59 percent in the first
three months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use a style that tries to buy good-quality businesses with
good-quality management at burnt-out prices,'' he said. When
markets were dropping in Hong Kong, South Korea and Thailand, he
added, ``most managers, to be frank, chickened out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought this was a unique opportunity,'' he said. ``Rarely
do you get a chance to buy something at 10 to 15 cents on the
dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his favorite picks is Hite Brewery, a South Korean beer
maker that is the domestic market leader. Its shares have
quadrupled in value since he bought them and are up 80 percent so
far this year.
</P>
<P>
   At the worst of South Korea's difficulties, in early 1998, when
investors were dumping stocks, Hite shares were at 4,800 won, and
the company's market cap fell to $40 million. ``That's like five
Anheuser-Busch Super Bowl commercials,'' he said. ``You know that
isn't right.'' The market cap is now $148 million.
</P>
<P>
   He also likes the Hong Kong-based Giordano International, a
leading retailer of casual clothing in Asia. The stock rose 65
percent in the first quarter. Buying up Giordano shares, he said,
``was just a no-brainer.''
</P>
<P>
   Herro, based in Chicago, says the seven analysts on his team
spend about half their time in Asia, researching and visiting
companies. Contrary to many of his competitors, Herro said, he is
not afraid of wild swings in Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things turned around in the third quarter of '98 for us, based
on sticking with these companies instead of running,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pinball Wizardry
</P>
<P>
   As its name implies, the Warburg Pincus Japan Small Company fund
is 100 percent invested in Japan, which has been struggling from
heavy bank debts and the worst recession since World War II.
Although that may sound like a recipe for disappointment and
disaster, its results suggest otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   While the fund fell 1.09 percent in 1995, its first year, and
lost 13 percent in 1996 and 25 percent in 1997, it gained more than
12 percent last year and rose 35.81 percent in the first quarter of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is increasing excitement that perhaps Japan has turned
the corner, that the government has its hands around the key
issues, that perhaps the economy is near bottom,'' said Todd
Jacobson, associate portfolio manager. ``This has set the stage,
once the economy has stabilized, for exponential growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares in a diverse range of small Japanese companies already
have benefited from this expectation, he said, partly because many
started moving some time ago to cut costs and become more
efficient.
</P>
<P>
   Among his favorites in this category are makers of pachinko
machines, a version of pinball that is as common in Japan as the
sushi bar. Jacobson said he liked Aruze, Heiwa and Sankyo
Company-Gunma, which are replacing many aging pachinko machines
throughout the country. Aruze's shares have risen 27 percent since
Jacobson began buying them in February. Heiwa has risen 38 percent
and Sankyo 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson also likes companies that are venturing into the
Internet, which is in the relatively early stages of development in
Japan. Unlike many American stocks in the sector, Japanese Internet
shares appear reasonably priced. Since February, when he bought
shares of JAC, a seller of used cars over the Internet, the
company's stock is up 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson, who is based in New York, says he and his colleagues
visit more than 500 Japanese companies a year. He spends at least
three months in Japan, sometimes going to four or five companies a
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a smaller-company universe, it is critically important to
do due diligence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Betting on Japan and Britain &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the T. Rowe Price International Discovery fund, Justin
Thomson also sees enormous potential value in small Japanese
companies that were battered by the country's slump. His fund,
which has about half its investments in Europe, began increasing
its Japanese holdings last October, to 25 percent from 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among his picks in Japan are Nidec, a provider of hard disk
drives for personal computers, and Nemic-Lambda, a maker of
switches and power components. Since hitting bottom in early
October, Nidec rose 64 percent and Nemic-Lambda climbed 140 percent
by the end of the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for increasing his exposure in Japan, he
said, is what he called the ``valuation effect'': some of these
stocks could not fall much further.
</P>
<P>
   The bet on Japan has paid off. After falling nearly 6 percent in
1997, the fund rose more than 6 percent last year and was up 15
percent in the first three months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson, based in London, said he saw a similar turnaround
trend among small British companies whose stocks fell sharply in
the third and fourth quarters of 1998. In his view, that was a good
time to be buying them.
</P>
<P>
   Among his favorite British picks is Eidos PLC, a game-software
company that created the best-selling Tomb Raider series and its
beautiful action heroine, Lara Croft. Since his fund bought Eidos
shares in the third quarter, they have nearly tripled.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fantastic growth industry,'' he said. With the surge
in ownership of personal computers, the popularity of Nintendo and
Sony Playstation and the excitement over Sony's Playstation II, he
said, ``demand for high-quality games is very, very high.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I have been called many things in my life, but I must
say, sunny has never been one of them.
</P>
<P>
   So imagine my surprise when confronted with a Polaroid of my
aura where my head and shoulders were suffused with a bright yellow
halo. ``Yellow corresponds symbolically to the welcome warmth of
sunlight,'' said the printout explaining the picture. ``Spontaneity
would best describe you.'' I had to laugh. If I could schedule a
sneeze, I would.
</P>
<P>
   I was examining my aura at the new Away Spa and Gym at the W
Hotel on Lexington Avenue, where the state-of-the-art services
include the chance to be attended to for two solid hours by someone
who never even touches you. Massage? Manicure? How passe. The thing
to do now is Aura Photographic Imaging and Analysis, followed by a
Color Hydrotherapy Wellness Bath and Pranic Healing. Which means?
</P>
<P>
   If you can't see it, we can fix it.
</P>
<P>
   These treatments are listed in Away's services under Alternative
Healing Modalities, though you don't have to be injured or ill to
partake of them. For most people, just getting through the day in
New York requires healing. So when they pay for someone to rub
their backs or feet or even their faces, for that matter, it's
understandable. But the body seems to have proved too mundane _ and
tangible _ a battlefield. Healing a person's spirit or the energy
surrounding the body is the industry's new horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Since the boom of the last five years increased the number of
day spas in Manhattan from 10 to 41, consumers are getting more
demanding _ and more easily bored. ``Spa goers have become more
sophisticated and are looking for new experiences,'' said Stephanie
Matolyak, the director of new business development at Spa Finders,
a reservations and marketing company for the industry. ``To keep
them coming back, day spas have to keep expanding their services.''
At some places, these are activities like henna tattooing and
applying hot stones to the body. At Away, it's aura imaging and
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   OK. Here's my question: If my aura is mostly sunny, with a
healthy dash of orange creativity and a thin rim of green growth
and healing, what needs fixing? It's not as if it were black and
blue.
</P>
<P>
   But logic doesn't seem to be among the modalities. Dressed in my
spa bathrobe and flip-flops, I was led to the tea bar and installed
in an easy chair with a cup of green tea. I breathed in that
peculiar spa smell: sort of like herbs, sort of like suntan oil,
sort of like Vicks Vaporub. It's like being on a tropical island
with an ear, nose and throat man.
</P>
<P>
   Iris, my practitioner, took me into the office of a sales
representative for my photo shoot. (They're a little squeezed for
space.) Iris fooled with a device labeled Aura Camera before
instructing me to place my hands on sensors atop two electronic
boxes.
</P>
<P>
   While my Polaroid developed, Iris took my printout, which came
from the machine attached to the sensors, and led me to a private
massage room while waiting for my color wellness bath to fill. We
examined the Polaroid together and she pointed out a faint wisp of
black inside the field of yellow, over my head. I started getting
nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think I have a brain tumor?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, don't go there,'' she said cheerfully. ``The spot
means you are thinking of something or working on something that is
difficult and not finished.'' How did she know that? Iris said that
although she joined Away as a massage therapist, she was trained in
aura reading by a color therapist hired by the spa.
</P>
<P>
   The bath was an enormous whirlpool into which she poured a
bright green liquid. ``What is that?'' I asked suspiciously. ``Oh,
it's all natural,'' she assured me. ``You could drink it if you
wanted to.'' Why green? ``It's the healing energy around the edge
of the aura, which means it's coming to you, so we emphasize
that.''
</P>
<P>
   She turned off the lights so only two candles illuminated the
room. I laid my head back on a towel and tried to relax. I hate
baths. And in the dark, I couldn't see any color at all. When the
lights were back on, she handed me a smudged plastic strip into
which she inserted a magenta film. ``This is soothing,'' she
advised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it clean?'' I asked, which I could see offended her, so I
held it to my eyes feeling utterly foolish and thoroughly
unsoothed. Then we returned to our room for pranic healing, billed
by the spa as ``an ancient art of energy healing.''
</P>
<P>
   Now I should say that I once had my qi healed, meaning that
according to Japanese tradition, negative energy was expelled from
my body. In that instance, though I scoffed going in, my bad knee
was pain free for weeks. So I was initially optimistic reading the
literature given me by Iris, which said the word ``pranic'' comes
from the Sanskrit word for ``vital life force.'' Diseased energy
makes a person sick and appears on the ``energy body'' before
getting to the physical body. (And to think I ever worried about
silly things like germs.)
</P>
<P>
   As I lay back on a sort of hospital bed arrangement, Iris told
me to imagine a safe, beautiful place and to relax. She put on a
tape of someone repeating ``om'' and showed me a basin of salt
water into which she would dispose of my negative energy.
</P>
<P>
   I closed my eyes and imagined a beach. Then I peeked. Iris had
her own eyes closed and was concentrating mightily, making circular
motions with her hands, then a throwing-away motion over the water.
Her fingers made a whispering sound, and between that and the oms,
I did relax.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty minutes later it was over. That was it? Two hours and I
was going to leave without any human contact? She grinned. Most
people want some massage after the healing, Iris said, offering to
do a Swedish massage for half an hour. Deal.
</P>
<P>
   When she was done, I made my way to the front desk. The aura
imaging, bath, healing and massage, plus tax and a 20 percent tip,
came to $263.60.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It later occurred to me that the procedure should have included
a reshoot of my aura after the healing. But maybe it would have
looked the same. Or would it? I enlisted a friend's sister,
Deborah, to have hers photographed, too. Afterward, she called,
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never done anything so silly,'' she said. It turned out
that Deborah's aura initially looked like mine _ overwhelming
yellow, dash of orange. Having complained of a headache, she was
put into a blue color bath, which her practitioner admitted was
tinted with food coloring. When she said her headache was gone,
they took another photo that showed the aura had turned green and
blue. ``As soon as I was back on the street,'' Deborah said, ``my
head was pounding again.''
</P>
<P>
   I decided to call Aura Imaging Co., which manufactures the Aura
Camera, and got Robert Kaiser, a sales representative. ``How
exactly does it work?'' I asked. ``And why would a sunny aura need
to be healed?''
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser explained that the camera was ``a biofeedback apparatus
that gives an electronic interpretation of what we believe the aura
would look like if we could see it _ there's nothing that exists
that can actually take a picture of your aura.'' So, what does it
do? It measures the electronic impulses on the palm, Kaiser said,
and then converts the information into an electronic frequency
displayed as colors or patterns. Oh.
</P>
<P>
   As for the yellow, Kaiser said it meant I was vibrant,
energetic, outgoing _ and stressed. He too, used to have a yellow
aura, he said, but now it was all blues and greens, which mean
contentment. What's changed? He laughed. ``I'm making a lot of
money now, so my stress level is way down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, so much for Sanskrit. In good old American capitalism,
green has always been for healing.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Friday, nearly 2 feet of snow blanketed Flagstaff and the
adjacent mountains of northern Arizona as a powerful late season
storm swept through the Southwestern states. Saturday, the jet
stream disturbance responsible for the wintry weather will emerge
onto the Plains, setting the stage for a variety of inclement
weather.
</P>
<P>
   A stripe of heavy snow will occur from eastern Wyoming to the
western Dakotas with up to a foot of snow likely in a few locations
by evening. Snow may be especially heavy near the eastern slopes of
the Black Hills in South Dakota, where northeast winds ascending
the sloping terrain aid in further moistening the air. Meanwhile,
warm air intruding above a shallow layer of sub-freezing air will
cause a narrow corridor of sleet and freezing rain from central
Nebraska to eastern South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Very strong thunderstorms will erupt in portions of the eastern
Plains and Mississippi Valley where sultry air surging north from
the Gulf of Mexico intercepts an approaching jet stream
disturbance. A few of the storms should produce large hail and
tornadoes. Isolated potent storms may also ignite late Saturday
afternoon along a east-moving ``dry line,'' which is a boundary
separating humid air from arid air.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and chilly breezes will cover the Northeast seaboard
while farther west and south, partly sunny, warm weather affects
the southern Great Lakes and Ohio Valley. Elsewhere, high pressure
over the Bahamas will promote ample sunshine and warm conditions
near the Southeast coast and in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Equable Eureka
</P>
<P>
   On March 31, Eureka, Calif., set a record daily low of 46
degrees culminating the sixth coldest month of March at the
northern coastal town. Extremes are unusual at Eureka which has a
quintessential maritime climate, characterized by small temperature
variations from day to day and month to month. The average high in
January is 53.4 degrees, while the average high in September,
Eureka's warmest month, is 62.2 degrees. Eureka's equable climate s
due to prevailing winds from the west blowing over cool Pacific
waters that fluctuate little in temperature during the year.

A NOVELIST IS RETURNING TO INDIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For Release Sunday, April 4)  
(DW) 
 By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amit Chaudhuri is homesick, and so he is returning to India.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhuri, 36, author of the recently published and highly
praised ``Freedom Song,'' a collection of three short novels,
arrived in England in 1983 as a student. He will be going back to
Calcutta, his birthplace and the ``city of dust'' of his fictions,
as an award-winning novelist, one The London Review of Books has
said writes ``better than just about anyone of his generation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just miss things,'' Chaudhuri said on the telephone from his
home in Cambridge, England, where he is Leverhulme Fellow in
English at Cambridge University and unofficial writer in residence
at St. John's College at the university. ``It's something quite
physical. I miss the street life, the street noises, the light. The
fact that windows remain open and you can hear sounds coming from
inside. It's a part of my subconscious. Calcutta is depleted in
many ways _ there's a large outflow of the middle class to America
_ and it can exasperate and disillusion me. But the spell is still
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhuri's collection _ his first book published in the United
States _ is part of a resurgence of Indian writing in recent years.
Arundhati Roy's ``God of Small Things'' spent more than 30 weeks on
the hard-cover fiction best-seller list of The New York Times in
1997 and 1998. ``Hullaballoo in the Guava Orchard,'' a first novel
by Kiran Desai, won critical praise last year. New novels by Salman
Rushdie (``The Ground Beneath Her Feet'') and Hanif Kureishi
(``Intimacy'') are being published this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Michiko Kakutani, writing in The Times, called Chaudhuri's work
``wonderfully observed'' and said he was a ``gifted young writer
who has created an indelible portrait of India'' while ``leaving us
with a Proustian tapestry of quotidian moments recaptured and
remade as they loom large and astonishing in his characters'
minds.''
</P>
<P>
   In the three short novels, nothing much happens. In the first,
``A Strange and Sublime Address,'' which won first prize in the
1991 Betty Trask Awards in England as well as the Commonwealth
Writers Prize, a young boy from Bombay visits his aunt and uncle in
Calcutta; in the second, ``Afternoon Raag,'' which won two other
prizes, an Oxford University student copes with two unhappy
romantic relationships and recalls his days in India. In the third,
``Freedom Song,'' published by Alfred A. Knopf, two families deal
with life in Calcutta amid the city's Hindu-Muslim strife.
</P>
<P>
   The writing, Ms. Kakutani said, may seem casual, even artless,
but there is a hidden subtlety. His ``long, beautifully crafted
sentences,'' The London Review of Books said, ``give the impression
of being worked on for hours for no other purpose than to do
justice to the messy spontaneity of real life.''
</P>
<P>
   For Chaudhuri, it is that messy spontaneity, the irrelevances
and digressions that make up human existence, that primarily
interests him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the incidentals, the unexpectedness in everyday life,
the things the mind notes down not quite consciously,'' he said.
``In the life we lead, where we suffer and procreate and are happy
and have fun and are disappointed, the world outside is interwoven,
with us almost not having noticed it. You can be in a taxi and
you're on the way to the hospital because someone is dying, and
there's the smell of the taxi's interior and an old car horn or the
fact that you're passing a bank where you withdraw cash. The poetry
of the everyday is important, because it is so idiosyncratic. It
goes unconsciously into the making of our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to his long, flowing sentences, he said, they are
the product of both reworking and time. ``It's not scratching them
out and writing them again,'' he said. ``It's the time I need to
distance myself. I can't pound out 500 or 700 words a day. I don't
know how writers do that. It's enviable. But often the changes are
deletions rather than adornments. The deletions allow the
sentences, the paragraphs, the story, to breathe life, to emerge
into their true shape. I delete the words that are hiding them,
covering them.''
</P>
<P>
   What he aims for, he said, is a portrait of people. ``India is
vast, and different parts have different problems,'' he said. ``In
Bombay it is excessive capitalism, Hindu fundamentalism and
right-wing politics. In Calcutta it's the opposite. Instead of
trying to attract investment in a global age it sometimes seems to
discourage it. Its problem is stagnation.''
</P>
<P>
   What attracts him, he said, is life amid change. ``Whether they
like it or not, whether they know it or not, the people are part of
a time in history,'' he said. ``They are making small movements in
their lives while being caught up in a larger current.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhuri was born in Calcutta in 1962 and raised in Bombay,
where his father, now retired, was a business executive. He made
frequent visits to relatives in Calcutta _ as does Sandeep, the
10-year-old at the heart of ``A Strange and Sublime Address.''
</P>
<P>
   From an early age, he said, he wanted to be a writer. ``I
wouldn't call it a profound desire,'' he said. ``I didn't have
anything I wanted to write about. V.S. Naipaul talks about wanting
to be a writer long before he had anything to write about. It's the
romance of writing. It got to me quite early.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhuri graduated from University College in London and
received his doctorate at Balliol College at Oxford University, the
setting of ``Afternoon Raag.'' He has also been Creative Arts
Fellow at Wolfson College at Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   His parents and other family members now live in Calcutta, he
said, providing another reason for his need to return. ``I'm quite
close to my parents,'' he said. ``I'm their only child. I also sing
_ I'm a north Indian classical singer _ and to keep in touch with
that I need to go back often. And my wife and I have an 8-month-old
daughter, and we want her to grow up in India.''
</P>
<P>
   His fellowship ends on Monday, and he decided not to apply for
another. He has in the last 15 years spent several months a year
back home, but England was always his base. Now his home will be in
India, with perhaps two or three months a year in England. ``It's
an experiment,'' he said. ``I'm going to write full time, which
will also give me time for my music.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, there is something else behind his decision. ``I
have met with nothing but kindness and generosity here and I feel
great warmth for the people,'' he said. ``But I'm a foreigner.
They're trying to make it a multiracial society, and on some levels
it works. But every time I have to enter immigration at Heathrow
Airport and show my visa and get asked questions, it's not a
particularly pleasant experience. It makes me realize that at some
level this is not where I belong.''
</P>
<P>
   His writing has been compared to Proust, but Chaudhuri says the
influences lie elsewhere, and are perhaps more related to his sense
of not really belonging in his adopted society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Proust could have filtered through from other writers,''
he said. ``I think more of Elizabeth Bowen and Katherine Mansfield.
I don't know if they were transformed by reading Proust, but they
too seem to deal with language and memory. It is more that they are
at a slight angle. Bowen is Irish and Mansfield is from New
Zealand.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused. ``Maybe that's what appeals to me,'' he said. ``Since
I myself am at a slight angle.''

NEW JERSEY IS NO LONGER THE PUNCH-LINE STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday April 4)  
(rk) 
 By FRANK DeCARO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``New York, let me take you out to New Jersey and bring New
Jersey back,'' the most popular woman in hip-hop shouted to the
sold-out Madison Square Garden theater on March 24. It was an
invitation Harrison Ford doesn't hear every day.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana Jones had come to see Lauryn Hill that night, as did
Starr Jones (no relation), Natalie Portman, Casey Affleck and a
screaming throng. They heard Ms. Hill, 23, beckon her Garden
audience to the Garden State without a trace of irony or
condescension.
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised (and still happily residing) in that part of
northern New Jersey called the Oranges, Ms. Hill actually likes her
home state. Her fondness is evident in her onstage patter and in
the childhood recollections of her song ``Every Ghetto, Every
City.''
</P>
<P>
   ``New Jersey is the greatest place in the world,'' Ms. Hill
declared at a party after the concert. ``It's close enough to New
York, but you still have a backyard and some trees.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``It's a great place to raise kids,'' of which she
has two. As the singer, who was wearing rimless glasses and a
stone-colored parka, mingled with her well-dressed well-wishers
(Armani Fragrances sponsored the party), one had to ask what impact
her status as an out-of-the-closet Jerseyan might be having on her
home state's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   After all, ``The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,'' her first solo
CD, has sold five million copies and won the Grammy for album of
the year. Could it be that she is making it cool to be from New
Jersey?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope so,'' Ms. Hill said. ``I hope I haven't made it
trashy.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodness knows it's too late for that. New Jersey didn't become
a national punch line _ ridiculed as a repository of industrial
waste and bad taste _ without reason. The words ``New Jersey''
conjure up sights and smells for many nonresidents of the northern
stretch of the New Jersey Turnpike _ tank farm after pipeline after
brewery.
</P>
<P>
   But these days there is the whiff of something sweeter in the
air. A lot of creativity is rising from the tomato patches and the
tacky strip malls, the Pine Barrens and the parking lots to the
immediate west of New York. In recent years, an entire New Jersey
oeuvre has emerged in popular culture, with Ms. Hill just the
hip-hop tip of the iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   It has captured the attention of moviegoers, readers and couch
potatoes alike _ a post-Springsteen school that has rethought the
suburbs as a place of humor, color and intrigue. These works recast
New Jersey's little towns as Peyton Places with secrets in every
cupboard, and they raise the question: If the suburbs are so
boring, why is this stuff so fascinating?
</P>
<P>
   ``New Jersey has gone from a private shame to a juggernaut,''
said the playwright Paul Rudnick, who grew up in Piscataway.
</P>

   Kevin Smith has lovingly explored slacker culture in his New
Jersey movie trilogy, ``Clerks,'' ``Mallrats'' and ``Chasing Amy.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Solondz, whose production company is based in Red Bank, has
made two films of suburban life, ``Welcome to the Dollhouse'' and
``Happiness,'' in which few characters may be enjoying the American
Dream, but none believe that Manhattan has a lock on cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of my friends can actually believe I live here,'' says a
character in ``Happiness,'' a writer played by Lara Flynn Boyle.
``But that's just because they don't get it. I'm living in a state
of irony.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, James Kaplan has written ``Two Guys From Verona,''
subtitled ``A Novel of Suburbia,'' which is just out in paperback.
It is about two middle-aged buddies who never sought to leave the
New Jersey town where they grew up, which has struck it nouveau
riche as the Dow cracks 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   All this from a state that ranks the Shop Rite ``Can-Can'' sale
among its cultural traditions. But more than anything, what has put
New Jersey on top lately is the HBO series ``The Sopranos,'' which
has taken off like a Trans Am down the parkway.
</P>
<P>
   Concluding its first season with Saturday night's operatic
finale, the show tells the story of a Prozac-popping Mafia don and
his two families _ his blood relatives and his bloodthirsty
cohorts.
</P>
<P>
   The series, which is shot on location in areas well known to its
creator, David Chase, and its star, James Gandolfini, both from New
Jersey, is the highest-rated drama on cable.
</P>
<P>
   In its 13 weeks, it has touched off the kind of enthusiasm among
hip audiences that ``Twin Peaks'' did nine years ago. If that cult
show was a Pacific Northwest riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an
enigma, ``The Sopranos'' is a suburban comedy wrapped in a mob
drama inside a cannoli.
</P>
<P>
   It's as much about New Jersey as it is about the mob. Each
episode is peppered with references to pastry shops in Nutley,
psychiatrists' offices in Montclair or formal wear places in
Paramus.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Falls of Paterson is both a beautiful and menacing
backdrop for the mob goings-on. And in Gandolfini, bearish and
balding at 37, New Jersey has found an unlikely sex symbol. His
portrayal of the sensitive (but murderous) don, Tony Soprano, is
central to the series' success.
</P>
<P>
   ``My intention is to present New Jersey as a place of contrasts,
like it really is,'' said Chase, who now resides in Los Angeles.
``I have a feeling that people think it's only a toxic dump. That's
why I include shots of the waterfall and the more bucolic scenes.
For such a small place, it has a lot of facets to it. And that's
only northern New Jersey. I wish we could go down the shore, but on
our budget we can't, sort of like when I was in high school.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Clifton and North Caldwell, Chase said, New Jersey
seemed ``very exciting and very mysterious,'' not dull and
predictable as many New Yorkers like to believe. ``There's
something sophisticated about the place, strangely enough,'' he
said. ``I think there's a certain savvy.''

   Jenny DeMonte, the editor of New Jersey Monthly, said that
sophistication has crept slowly over the state in the last two
decades, as affluence has brought higher home prices, better
restaurants, more museums and upscale shopping. ``Have you been to
Short Hills mall?'' she said. ``It's outrageous.'' Ms. DeMonte said
that newcomers sometimes still labor under the state's tawdry
image. ``There are a lot of people who move out here to their big
house in Summit who are in denial,'' she said. ``It's as if they
don't really live in New Jersey. But after three or four years,
they realize not only is it OK, it's really great. We help them
work through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Working through their problems with New Jersey is what many who
once hated the state say they've done. Deborah Harry, the New Wave
goddess, is finally admitting _ after all the peroxide and
posturing of the 1970s and '80s _ that she's really just a
``tomato'' (her word) from Paterson, who spent her youth on ``this
section of street up in Totowa where all the slutty girls would
walk around and meet boys.'' So she confesses to an interviewer in
the March issue of Esquire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of funny that I've come around to this Jersey
consciousness and appreciation of my Jersey background,'' Ms. Harry
is quoted as saying. ``You come through all these stages of trying
to be this and trying to be that, just to end up at a state of
learning to appreciate what you really are.'' Her new album with
her old group Blondie is called ``No Exit.'' She, however, is from
Exit 18 on the turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   If New Jersey chic is on the rise, Vanity Fair magazine gets
some credit for starting the ball rolling. A little more than three
years ago, it ran an article titled ``Garden State Babylon,'' which
listed, by turnpike exit, more than 120 celebrities, from Charles
Addams to Pia Zadora, who hail from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   It dubbed the state not only ``the most ravaged of the original
13 Colonies,'' but also ``the nation's leading exporter of
celebrities.'' Diverse ones, too, not just Connie Francis and Lola
Falana, but also Meryl Streep and Martha Stewart. For every Joe
Piscopo, Robert Blake and Bruce Willis, there's a Jack Nicholson,
Tom Cruise and Ed Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Stewart, the host of ``The Daily Show With Jon Stewart'' on
Comedy Central and a native of Lawrence Township, maintains that
the reason people make fun of New Jersey is because outsiders see
only the worst of it through their car windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the `Elephant Man' syndrome _ until you get to know him,
you don't know he's a pretty good guy,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   But he would have it no other way. ``Let people believe the
Hamptons are where it's at,'' he said. ``I would ultimately like to
find a place down the shore and live there. This area is more
comfortable to me than anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``54,'' last year's film about Studio 54, Ryan Phillippe
plays a naive New Jersey pretty boy plucked out of the crowd behind
the velvet rope to become a bartender at the disco.
</P>
<P>
   He falls for a soap-opera actress with the same roots, played by
Neve Campbell. The film portrays New York City as glamorous but
phony. New Jersey, by contrast, is mundane but fundamentally
decent.
</P>
<P>
   After he has witnessed the elitism, the drug taking and the
ruthless social climbing, he learns to appreciate his home state.
When federal agents close the disco, Phillippe is tossed out
shirtless into the cold, and wraps himself in a garbage bag. Ms.
Campbell steps out of the back of a limousine wearing a fur.
``Let's face it,'' she tells him. ``We're Jersey.'' &QL;

THE SOLUTION IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The success of the Dayton peace accords, which ended the war in
Bosnia, may have led the United States and its NATO allies into
drawing wrong conclusions about Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   One of the myths of the Bosnian war is that the NATO bombing of
the Bosnian Serbs in the summer of 1995 caused them to sue for
peace. That so-called ``lesson of Bosnia'' was applied to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Bosnian Serbs had already been beaten when the
bombing came, with the US-fortified armies of Croatia and the
Bosnian Muslims rolling them up on a wide front. They had already
signaled their willingness to stand down if they could get their
own Bosnian Serb republic.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Bosnia, Kosovo is a province of Serbia with great
historic and emotional symbolism. Slobodan Milosevic rose to power
on the issue of protecting the Kosovo Serbs, and they cannot be
sold out as easily as were the Bosnian Serb leaders, whom Milosevic
despised and wanted to undercut. Dayton offered Milosevic the
carrot of a Serb entity. The Rambouillet format offered only the
humiliation of a NATO occupation followed by Kosovar independence
within a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with NATO's miscalculations and Milosevic's hideous mass
expulsion of Albanian Kosovars, the equation that existed at
Rambouillet has changed, and a similar agreement may no longer be
possible. An effort should be made toward a face-saving formula
that would scrap the diktats of Rambouillet and offer Serbia a deal
whereby independence for Kosovo would be put off indefinitely and
Albanian Kosovars could return under the protection of an
international force not made up of American, British, French and
German soldiers _ Greece, Italy, even Russia might play a role
instead _ and Kosovo's pre-1989 autonomy would be restored under
the leadership of Ibrahim Rugova, the Kosovar moderate.
</P>
<P>
   It is nauseating to have to make a deal with Milosevic, but what
is needed now are cool heads to stop the great tragedy that is
unfolding and prevent the tragedies that will come if the war
continues much longer.

APOCALYPSE WHEN?  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apocalypse? Now? It depends who you're talking to. One in four
Christians believes that Jesus will return in their lifetime, an
Associated Press poll reported in 1997. The idea that the
apocalypse and the coming of Jesus will occur on Jan. 1, 2000 is
derived _ imperfectly, perhaps _ from the Bible, which nowhere
gives an exact date for the event.
</P>
<P>
   But Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists and Zoroastrians also have ideas
about end of the world. Ancient Greeks, Egyptians and American
Indians all had apocalyptic beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars say that Zoroastrianism, founded by the Iranian
prophet Zarathustra (or Zoroaster, as the Greeks called him) around
1300 B.C., laid the foundation for Judeo-Christian teachings about
the apocalypse. Zoroastrians ``taught that the world has a
beginning and an end and forms the field of a cosmic battle between
good and evil,'' between Ahura Mazda, the Lord of Wisdom, and
Ahriman, who is wicked, said James Russell, a professor at Harvard
University.
</P>
<P>
   Zoroaster never specified a date for the world's end. But ``he
suggested it would end with the coming of a savior; and that the
world would then be cleansed of death and wickedness and people
would rise from the dead,'' Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   Zoroaster's followers later said the world would last 12,000
years; the final 6,000 years represent human history. ``The process
of apocalypse is played out over the final 3,000 years of the human
era with three saviors,'' said Russell. The final savior, and most
important, is Astvat Ereta whose name means ``righteousness
embodied.'' Like Jesus, Astvat Ereta had a miraculous birth; his
virgin mother was impregnated with Zoroaster's seed while bathing
in a lake.
</P>
<P>
   Zoroastrians believe the wicked will be judged and punished in
an ordeal of molten metal. Evil will be destroyed, and purified
sinners will be renewed for eternity. A minority of Zoroastrians
believe that humanity is in the final phase of the 3,000 years.
But, said Russell, ``Most Zoroastrians don't think about the end
too much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The date when the world absolutely ends is the spring equinox
of the 12,000th year from the creation of the universe,'' Russell
said. ``The problem is, no one knows exactly what year that was.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholars say Zoroastrianism found its way into Old Testament
accounts of the apocalypse, which were supposed to console Jews in
their suffering. The Book of Daniel, for instance, offered hope to
Jews persecuted during the second century B.C. In the New
Testament, Jesus draws on the Old Testament Book of Isaiah to
describe his apocalyptic return. When Jesus failed to come as soon
as his followers had hoped, they focused on his eventual return,
which is described allegorically in the Book of Revelation.
</P>
<P>
   Islam generally ties the end of the world to the Second Coming
of Jesus, whom Muslems see as a prophet. ``The Trumpet shall be
blown,'' says the Koran, ``and the eyes of sinners will turn blue
with terror.''
</P>
<P>
   But Islam has never been preoccupied with the apocalypse, says
Peter Awn, a professor at Columbia University. Most Islamic
traditions affix no date to it. ``Only God knows when that will
occur,'' Awn said.
</P>
<P>
   As the end approaches, Muslims believe, there will be a period
of moral decay. The demons Gog and Magog (who are also in the Book
of Revelation and rabbinic literature) will break through a barrier
of iron and molten copper.
</P>
<P>
   A one-eyed figure, Dajjal, resembling the Antichrist, will bring
chaos and destruction. Eventually, Dajjal will be slain by Jesus,
Muslims say, and God will reward the good with paradise and condemn
the evil to hell.
</P>
<P>
   In the Shiite tradition of Islam (accounting for about 15
percent of Muslems), a savior, the Imam Mahdi, ``the rightly guided
one whose return everyone is waiting for'' and who is a direct
descendant of the prophet Mohammed, initiates the end time. The
majority of Muslims have a tradition of the Mahdi as a human
political and religious leader who comes every 100 years or so to
renew the community.
</P>
<P>
   In Hinduism, there are several cycles of time, hundreds of
thousands of years long, and there are several Doomsdays. Usually,
doomsdays are preceded by a period of moral decay. Eventually, the
world is destroyed by fire and flood. Most Hindus affix no date to
the end. Each cycle, or ``kalpa,'' has four ages. We are now in the
fourth age, the ``kali yuga'' age, said Wendy Doniger, a professor
at the University of Chicago. It is ``the lousy age.''
</P>
<P>
   Hinduism has many sects, but there is no figure exactly like the
Messiah, though Hindus consider Jesus a saint. ``Many comparisons
have been made between Christ and the Hindu deity, Krishna,'' said
John Hawley, a professor at Barnard College. Many consider him an
incarnation of the great god Vishnu. Krishna, said Hawley, is ``a
god of love who wishes to protect his devotees and to save the
world from destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hindu god Kalki, a looming presence, another incarnation of
Vishnu, is also an apocalyptic figure who will destroy the present
cosmos. Kalki is sometimes represented as riding a white horse and
carrying a sword, reminiscent of the horsemen of the apocalypse in
the Bible. ``Kalki draws down the curtain on time as we know it,''
said Hawley. ``And sometimes reopens it immediately to a period of
prosperity and peace, when the troublemakers are gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Hinduism has no single day of judgment. ``By contrast, at the
end of an individual life you have a judgment figure holding a book
which contains an accounting'' of that person's life, Hawley said.
Hinduism has many heavens and hells. One hell has trees with leaves
of razor blades. But at the end of each doomsday cycle, the
universe, and all heavens and hells, are destroyed. Some Hindus
believe there are ``millions of years of quiescence in which the
god Vishnu sleeps,'' said Ms. Doniger, ``and he awakens and we all
awaken.''
</P>
<P>
   Buddhism teaches that the universe never begins or ends. ``The
cosmos we live in is only one of an infinite number,'' said Frank
Reynolds, a professor at the University of Chicago. ``There
definitely is an apocalyptic end to our world, by wind, fire or
water.'' But there is no date attached to the destruction of our
world, many Buddhists believe, and the universe endures.
</P>
<P>
   One Buddhist metaphor speaks of the afterlife as a passage into
heaven or hell or another human existence. The individual's destiny
is determined by karma, the effect of his deeds. This passage is
sometimes represented as a judgment, presided over by a divine
figure. There is no single judgment day in most Buddhist sects.
Heavens and hells are usually temporary states until the individual
is consigned to another rebirth. The goal is to escape suffering
and attain nirvana, a condition beyond being or nonbeing.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhism contains varying notions of a savior: the historical
Buddha, Gautama, lived some 2,500 years ago. As time passes
Buddhism will decline. At the end of 5,000 years, ``Gautama's
relics will come together, he will preach a sermon, and then be no
more,'' said Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   Some Buddhists believe that another Buddha named Maitreya will
establish an ideal society. ``There will be easier access to
nirvana,'' Reynolds said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain Buddhist groups have believed that Maitreya's coming
was imminent, particularly in periods of oppression,'' Reynolds
said.
</P>
<P>
   As in most religions, it is in times of chaos and moral collapse
that people long for a Messiah to relieve them from their pain and
suffering.

Workers at the garden often help themselves to leaves of one plant

science with the knowledge of traditional healers. (Ferriss, Cox

   Although it's fun to see who's hot and who's not among mutual
fund managers each quarter, the real value of the performance
figures lies in the stock market intelligence they provide. A look
behind the numbers can help reveal the overall market's strength or
weakness. Closer scrutiny can help gauge the current mood and
vulnerabilities of investors.
</P>
<P>
   The snapshot of the first-quarter data of 1999 is no exception.
It shows stock-fund investors making increasingly risky bets on a
small group of companies. Having virtually given up on managers who
pick stocks based on earnings growth or a solid financial base,
more and more investors have chosen simply to bet on the market.
</P>
<P>
   More than three-quarters of the money going into mutual funds
during the first months of 1999 has been funneled into funds that
mirror the returns of large-capitalization stock indexes like the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500. Although investors have been increasing
their allocations to index funds in recent years, those funds have
never dominated the inflow figures as they do now.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Adler, president of AMG Data Services, which tracks
mutual fund flows, said the numbers showed a major change in
investor sentiment this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors who are performance-driven are going to the low-cost
provider that mirrors the market rather than investing based on
fundamentals,'' Adler said. ``They are betting the market rather
than the securities that underlie it.''
</P>
<P>
   As more investors make this bet, however, a decline in mutual
fund inflows is raising warning flags about the market's immediate
future. According to Adler, the total money going into equity funds
so far this year is down 64 percent from the comparable period of
1998. The money pouring into stock mutual funds in recent years has
given great support to stocks; if the spigot goes dry, share prices
will fall.
</P>
<P>
   AMG statistics show that $16.2 billion went into stock funds
through March 25, the most recent figures available, down from
$45.3 billion in the 1998 period. The bulk of the new money _ $13.3
billion, or 82 percent _ went into large-capitalization stock index
funds. That was almost double the $7.1 billion that went into these
funds during the comparable period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Most of this money appears to be contributions to 401(k)
retirement plans, but some of it may well be cash that investors
are removing from underperforming funds in other sectors. For
example, small-company stock funds and international funds both
showed net redemptions in the first months of 1999, according to
AMG.
</P>
<P>
   Another revelation in the first-quarter performance numbers is
how far the top-performing mutual funds have strayed from their
origins. Stock mutual funds used to be a way for individuals to
diversify stock holdings, reduce risks and keep transaction costs
low. But if the winners in the first-quarter performance
sweepstakes are any guide, those days are over.
</P>
<P>
   Diversification? What a quaint idea! According to their latest
Securities &AMP; Exchange Commission filings as tracked by the Chicago
financial publisher Morningstar Inc., many of the winners' top
holdings include the same favored stocks: America Online,
Microsoft, Dell Computer, Ascend Communications and others.
</P>
<P>
   Reduced risks? With technology stocks making up one-third to
one-half of these funds' holdings, their managers are making a very
big bet on one sector. Low costs? Many of the funds have loads and
higher-than-average portfolio turnovers and expense ratios.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the message from the top funds in the first quarter is
the antithesis of what used to be considered solid investment
advice: Forget fundamental research, buy the same stocks everybody
else is buying, chase yesterday's winners and ratchet up the risk.
</P>
<P>
   And as more funds continue to underperform their benchmarks, it
is almost predictable that managers who have been sticking to old
methods will throw in the towel and start to parrot the winners'
portfolios, too.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, this is likely to push some highflying stocks to
even loftier levels. But even the most favored stock cannot go up
forever. Consider the recent action in Dell Computer. After two
disappointing quarters, it is down almost 25 percent from its high
for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The top three equity funds during the quarter all belong to the
Van Wagoner group. Van Wagoner's Emerging Growth fund jumped 55.84
percent in the quarter, followed by its Micro-Cap fund, which
returned 33.36 percent. Van Wagoner's Mid-Cap fund rose 32.10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   There is a sameness about Emerging Growth and Mid-Cap: the top
20 holdings in each fund included eight of the same companies at
the end of the year. And calling the third fund a micro-cap
portfolio is something of a misnomer: its top two holdings as of
year-end, Exodus Communications and Telebanc Financial, have market
values of $2.7 billion and $1 billion, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Van Wagoner's ascendancy follows two years of woeful returns. In
1997, the Emerging Growth and Micro-Cap funds both lost 20 percent
and the Mid-Cap fund fell 13.88 percent. Last year, all three made
money for shareholders, but underperformed the market.
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case for years, many more fund managers lagged
behind the market than beat it in the quarter. While the S&AMP;P 500
rose 4.65 percent, the roughly 2,500 U.S. diversified stock funds
returned 1.26 percent, on average. The biggest losers among equity
funds were those investing in small-company stocks.

 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOTLAN, Mexico _ Inside a tiny jail cell in this small rural
town, two Huichol Indian men accused of killing journalist Philip
True have changed their story for a third time, confounding even
their lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   They now say they didn't kill the San Antonio Express-News
correspondent, and that they only briefly saw him hiking through
their village in the Sierra Madre Occidental mountains of Jalisco
state one sunny morning in early December.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you the truth, I saw him walking by when I was
vaccinating my cows. That's all,'' said Juan Chivarra de La Cruz,
speaking from his cell. ``I never saw the gringo before in my life.
I didn't touch him. I didn't kill him.''
</P>
<P>
   True, 50, was on a 100-mile hike to photograph and write about
the Huichol Indians who live in remote villages along the rugged
mountain range that spans four western states: Jalisco, Zacatecas,
Durango and Nayarit.
</P>
<P>
   An experienced hiker and camper, True departed Nov. 29,
estimating the solo trip would last 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   But he barely made it one-third of the way. His body was found
on Dec. 16, buried in a shallow grave after an agonizing, weeklong
search by relatives, friends, colleagues and the Mexican police and
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   He had been dead for about a week.
</P>
<P>
   Chivarra and his brother-in-law Miguel Hernandez de la Cruz were
arraigned in the death on Dec. 28 after the police said the men
confessed to strangling True, allegedly because they were angered
he was hiking and taking photographs without permission from the
local Huichol authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, they still admitted killing True, but they told
reporters and a criminal court judge that it was because the
journalist threatened family members.
</P>
<P>
   On a warm afternoon last week in this quiet Jalisco town of
16,000 people, Chivarra and Hernandez changed their story anew,
saying they confessed to the crime only because they were beaten
and tortured by men in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   For three months, dozens of reporters have travelled to this
remote corner of Mexico to question the two suspects about the
mysterious murder that has made headlines around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Chivarra said he had grown sick of talking to the news media and
vowed not to give any more interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go away! Leave!'' Chivarra shouted before sauntering back to
his cell.
</P>
<P>
   But Chivarra, 28, was curious. He was also glad for the
attention that relieves the monotony of prison life.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually returned to inspect the reporters, grabbing a pair
of black sunglasses from a guard and prancing for the camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me money!'' he demanded, his hands gripping bars chipped
with blue paint.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez shyly peered from behind a wall, laughing at
Chivarra's antics.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of their lawyer on day last week, they officially
amended their initial confession, apparently alleging it was made
under duress, the judge in the case said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legally they have a right to do that,'' Judge Felix Enrique
Aguiar said. ``One of them said he had an encounter with Mr. True,
but obviously he is saying he didn't kill him.''
</P>
<P>
   Chivarra and Hernandez said they were tortured into confessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hit us a lot. So I decided to say, `Yes, yes, we did
it,''' Chivarra said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hung me by the neck from a tree,'' added Hernandez, 24,
who rarely speaks, deferring to his brother-in-law. ``If you are
hanging from a tree, you will agree to anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They trapped us like cats,'' Chivarra said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'' are uniformed authorities. Chivarra said they were all
the same to him: soldiers or the police, and he doesn't know which
arm of the law apprehended them.
</P>
<P>
   From their mountain ranch in the municipality of Mesquitic, the
two were taken to Guadalajara, the capital of Jalisco state. In
January, they were moved to Colotlan pending a ruling in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Colotlan was chosen because it is the nearest city to the crime
scene, which officials here say is about a three-day's drive away.
</P>
<P>
   Famous for its beaded leather belts made out of the agave plant,
Colotlan is 150 miles north of Guadalajara. It is accessible only
through narrow mountain roads that traverse the states of Jalisco
and Zacatecas, past canyons, cactus and grassy fields.
</P>
<P>
   Chivarra and Hernandez are in a rudimentary municipal cell
painted in blue and white, sharing space with five other men
charged with murder _ four of them Huichols.
</P>
<P>
   It is here that Aguiar will decide the fate of the two men.
</P>
<P>
   The case has been thrown into a bit of a whirl following the
reported discovery of True's journal, which had been locked up as
evidence along with a backpack and other True belongings.
</P>
<P>
   The diary, read by a Newsweek correspondent, apparently mentions
Chivarra's anger at True for not having approval from Huichol
authorities to travel through their land.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks bad for a bit,'' True wrote, according to Newsweek.

DOW SHOWS RICH GETTING RICHER, GROUP SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) _ An organization that fights the widening income gap
in America says the Dow's historic 10,000-point close helps justify
its crusade.
</P>
<P>
   Most U.S. households, according to United for a Fair Economy,
have lower net worths than they did in 1983, when the Dow was at
1,000. Only the wealthiest households have profited along with the
gains of the Dow Jones industrial average, the Boston-based
organization says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had over two decades of public policies and corporate
practices benefiting affluent asset owners at the expense of wage
earners,'' said Chuck Collins, co-director of United for a Fair
Economy.
</P>
<P>
   The group has published a 94-page booklet, ``Shifting Fortunes:
The Perils of the Growing American Wealth Gap,'' based on research
by Edward Wolff, a New York University economist, and other
findings.
</P>
<P>
   The report says that average U.S. workers are earning less,
adjusted for inflation, than they did during the Nixon presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff calculates the wealthiest 1 percent of households have 40
percent of the national wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at who has prospered because of the stock market's
gains, ``Shifting Fortunes'' says:
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 90 percent of the value of all stocks and mutual funds
owned by households is in the hands of the wealthiest 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ten percent of households benefited from about 86 percent of the
stock market increases between 1989 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1970s, the top 1 percent of households doubled
their share of the national wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only 45 percent of Americans have stock in any form,'' said
Betsy Leondar-Wright, an author of the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear so much about working Americans' access to 401(k)
plans, but the reality is that lots of workers who are offered
stock ownership through those plans can't afford to buy it because
they need their income for living expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the Federal Reserve reports that 25 percent of U.S.
household wealth is in stocks, up from 8 percent in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The United for a Fair Economy report details the comparatively
declining fortunes of the less wealthy. It says, for example, that
the median inflation-adjusted net worth of U.S. households was
$49,900 in 1997, down from $54,600 in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, nearly one in five U.S. households has
a zero or negative net worth. The report also said average weekly
wages in 1998 were 12 percent lower than in 1973, adjusting for
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The Fair Economy point of view is challenged by some economists.
For example, W. Michael Cox, a senior fellow at the National Center
for Policy Analysis and an economic adviser at the Federal Reserve
Bank in Dallas, says measures of real-wage decline and widening
wage gaps paint unduly pessimistic pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Cox, who recently co-wrote /{Myths of Rich and Poor: Why We're
Better Off Than We Think/}, says consumption _ not real wages or
investments _ is a better measure of Americans' financial health.
</P>
<P>
   Cox contends that even the poorest Americans are better off in
terms of how long they have to work to pay for things and what they
get for their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the poor have more,'' according to Cox, who argues that a
``you vs. me'' scorecard emphasizing the widening income gap
obscures the reality that all Americans are improving their lot.

 UNDATED: company stocks.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The underperformance is not simply a result of management
decisions. It reflects the current bifurcated state of the market,
in which large-cap stocks wildly outperform the shares of smaller
companies. Indeed, more than three-quarters of domestic stocks
lagged behind the year-to-date return of the S&AMP;P 500 by 15 percent
or more.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest loser in the quarter was Profunds Ultra Short OTC, a
portfolio that bets against performance of stocks in the Nasdaq 100
Composite. Many of these stocks are investor favorites that rose
substantially during the period, creating at loss of 29.91 percent
in the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Among sector funds, the laggards included some portfolios
invested in precious metals, real estate and utility stocks. The
latter two groups were hurt by rising interest rates as the yield
on the 30-year Treasury bond climbed to 5.62 percent at the end of
the quarter, from 5.1 percent at the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The winners among equity funds, meanwhile, show the market's
current bias toward any stock with a huge market capitalization, a
household name and anything to do with technology. Many top
holdings of those funds look virtually the same _ a handful of
stocks that, more than ever, are holding up the entire market.
Names like MCI Worldcom, Amazon.com and Cisco Systems tend to
dominate the portfolios, showing their managers to be not so much
stock-pickers as fad finders.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of similarity does nothing for investors seeking
diversification. ``If you buy funds based on which ones have the
best performance in the most recent quarter,'' said Amy Arnott,
editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds, ``you're going to end up with a
lot of overlap with individual stocks and sectors.''
</P>
<P>
   And with more of their eggs in the same basket, their risks
rise. As long as the stocks go up, the investor will be fine. But
when they start to turn, there may be little else left in the
portfolio to cushion the fall.
</P>
<P>
   But the problems go deeper than a lack of diversification. There
is also further evidence that fund investors have increased their
risk levels in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   According to Chase Securities Inc., mutual fund assets that are
managed for growth _ including funds whose objectives are growth,
aggressive growth, and growth and income _ accounted for nearly 60
percent of all fund assets at the end of 1998. In 1994, those
categories made up 40.8 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   Taking on more risk is the opposite of what investors should be
doing as the market rises. As stock prices move ever higher _ the
S&AMP;P 500 is now trading at 34 times earnings, about twice the median
level over time _ investors may want to take some of their chips
off the table, not add to the pot.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these mutual fund investors are a proxy for a wider
investor universe, we have a huge bet that is occurring in a market
that is dependent on the continued performance of just a few
securities.'' Adler of AMG said.
</P>
<P>
   While the first-quarter performance of American stock funds
largely continued past trends, there were some interesting
reversals of recent patterns in funds that invest abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery of the Japanese stock market brought gains to
investors there after years of losses. Among the top 20
international stock funds, fully half were those investing in Japan
or the Pacific Rim. The Fidelity Japan Small Companies fund
returned 41.85 percent in the quarter, edging out the Warburg
Pincus Japan Small Company fund, which gained 35.81 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And some emerging-markets funds came back to life in the
quarter, benefiting from market turnarounds in India, South Korea
and even Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Among bond funds, the performance story was all high-yield. Legg
Mason's High Yield Portfolio rose 11.34 percent in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the jump in bond yields during the quarter,
American Century's bond portfolios with fixed maturities were the
biggest losers. Many portfolios that invested in foreign bonds were
hard hit as well, because of a strong dollar and weak foreign
economies.

intrusion were splashed all over the news. Before you could say
``plug the hole,'' a spate of alternative products began filling it
up. Meanwhile, competitors such Hebel and Ytong, Elite Cement and
Sider-Oxydro have been trying hard to tell metro Atlanta builders
that there are other ways to have the stucco look and insulation

<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors looking to ride the resurgent, though risky, emerging
markets might consider closed-end funds. Emerging-markets
closed-end funds are up 10.7 percent on average through late March,
and some funds like Templeton Russia, the India fund and Turkish
Investment are up 30 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   Closed-end funds can be an attractive way to invest in emerging
markets because most are selling at discounts to their net asset
value, averaging 5.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their open-end brethren, closed-end funds issue a fixed
number of shares that trade the same way as stocks. As a result,
they can be priced at a premium or discount to the value of their
holdings. By contrast, open-end funds continually issue and redeem
shares, which always trade at net asset value.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunities in closed-end funds extend beyond emerging
markets to domestic equity and fixed-income funds. Now may be a
good time, for example, to take advantage of seasonal trading
patterns in fixed-income funds. All closed-end funds tend to sag in
December because of year-end tax selling. And in April,
fixed-income funds, especially tax-exempt funds, tend to trade at
especially large discounts, as investors sell them to pay taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Discounts to net asset value make closed-end funds attractive
because investors aren't paying full price for the underlying
assets. The trick is to buy closed-end funds when they trade at
deeper discounts than their historical average, said Gregg Wolper,
closed-end fund editor at Morningstar, the fund publisher.
</P>
<P>
   While discounts to net asset value are generally not as steep as
they were late last year, they are still relatively wide, he said.
``There are still really worthwhile opportunities in the closed-end
fund universe, not only in terms of good funds but also good
prices,'' he said. ``Funds are trading at good discounts.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is no guarantee that the discounts will ever
narrow.
</P>
<P>
   Among domestic equity funds, for example, discounts average
11.29 percent of net asset value, almost as big as they were late
last year. As a result, investors can pick up high-quality funds
relatively cheaply. Central Securities, which has been managed by
Wilmot Kidd for 25 years, ``is one of the best mid-cap funds of any
kind,'' Wolper said; it has often traded at a premium, but is now
available at a 20.5 percent discount. The fund has returned 20.2
percent a year, on average, the last 10 years on a net asset basis.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, investors can pick up the Salomon Brothers fund at a
9.2 percent discount. The fund, a large-company value portfolio,
has outperformed 70 percent of its peers the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the recent action in closed-end funds has been in the
international sector. Not only have emerging markets rebounded, but
some activist shareholders, especially institutional investors,
have been pushing funds to eliminate persistent discounts to net
asset value. In the last two years, according to Merrill Lynch,
more than a dozen closed-end single-country funds have decided to
convert to open-end funds or to liquidate.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, the discount should be eliminated and investors
should be able to sell at net asset value. But there can be tax
consequences to creating an open-end fund because a surge in
redemptions can force a manager to sell appreciated securities.
Moreover, fund companies often impose fees on the sales of such
funds, warned Douglas Beck, senior international equity funds
analyst at Merrill.
</P>
<P>
   Beck recommended that investors focus instead on fundamentals
and buy funds with attractive portfolios and enticing discounts.
Among his favorites is the Mexico fund, the oldest and largest
closed-end fund investing in Mexican companies. The Mexican stock
market is up 24.5 percent so far this year, and the fund is selling
at a 25 percent discount to net asset value. ``We would expect that
discount to narrow as people start to reassess emerging markets,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Porter, the closed-end country fund analyst at Salomon
Smith Barney, is also enthusiastic about some emerging-markets
funds. ``My pick of the year is Templeton Vietnam and Southeast
Asia,'' he said. The fund, managed by J. Mark Mobius, the prominent
manager of several Templeton emerging-markets funds, broadened its
mandate beyond Vietnam in April 1998 to include other Southeast
Asian countries. Porter is expecting a rebound in Asian markets
next year as the region moves to recover from its deep recession.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the fund is invested in Thailand, Hong Kong and
Singapore. It is selling at a 19.5 percent discount. Porter expects
the fund, which has been trading around $7 a share, to reach $9 to
$9.50 the next 12 to 16 months.
</P>
<P>
   Investors seeking income should also check closed-end funds,
said Wolper of Morningstar. Their attraction over open-end funds is
higher yields, but not necessarily more risk. Closed-end funds pay
income based on net asset value, so when investors buy shares at a
discount, they are getting a fatter yield.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Trefonas, 60, a food broker in Chicago, has been a
longtime investor in Northeast Investors, an open-end junk bond
fund. In September, he bought shares of a closed-end fund, Salomon
Brothers High Income II. The fund is yielding 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The open-end fund yield was nowhere near this,'' he said.
Northeast Investors, which Trefonas still owns, yields 9.3 percent.
The Salomon fund sells at a slight discount and its credit rating
from Standard &AMP; Poor's is slightly lower than that of Northeast
Investors.
</P>
<P>
   George Foot, managing partner at Newgate LLP, a money management
firm, likes two high-yield closed-end funds: the Debt Strategies
fund, yielding 12.2 percent, and Senior High Income, yielding 10.8
percent. Both funds now trade at discounts to net asset value,
versus premiums last year.
</P>
<P>
   Among more conservative income funds owned by Foot is ACM
government Spectrum, which yields 9 percent, yet has an average
credit rating of double A. (The typical double A bond yields about
6 percent.) Eighty percent of the fund is invested in triple
A-rated United States government securities, with 20 percent in
emerging-markets bonds. Foot expects the fund's 12 percent discount
to narrow to its 10 percent average, giving him an 11 percent total
return the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Investors may also want to look at tax-exempt closed-end
municipal bond funds. Thomas J. Herzfeld, president of the money
management firm Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors, includes MSDW
Municipal Income II and III on his buy list. They are yielding
about 5.6 percent and trading at discounts of 12 percent to 13
percent. For investors in the 28 percent bracket, the
tax-equivalent yield is 7.8 percent.

BUDGET FLAP OVER FUNDING FOR DISABLED INTENSIFIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLINGER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. _ Each day a health-care worker bathes and feeds
10-year-old Janelle Epps, who is developmentally disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The Olathe girl doesn't know that a budget debate raging in the
Legislature could threaten the quality of care she gets. But her
mother, Susan Epps, is painfully aware.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very concerned and upset,'' Epps said. ``These services
are critical for my daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   As the budget debate heated up this week, state welfare
officials cut off payments to many contract providers, including
Johnson County Developmental Supports, which provides Janelle's
health-care worker.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders in the Legislature labeled the action a
``scare tactic,'' and advocates for those with disabilities called
it political terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   For months, advocates have said that Gov. Bill Graves' proposed
budget for the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services was
inadequate and could result in cuts in services for more than 330
developmentally disabled people.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Laing, director of InterHab, an organization that supports
people with disabilities, said the budget did not even provide
enough money to keep services going through June 30, the end of the
budget year.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to solve those financial woes, a coalition of
conservative Republicans led by state Rep. Phill Kline of Shawnee
and House Democrats on Friday cut about $50 million from Graves'
budget. But then they put $30 million of that back in the budget
for mental-retardation and mental-health services. Advocates for
those groups were jubilant.
</P>
<P>
   Social and Rehabilitation Services officials, however, said the
cuts included some funding for the remainder of this year, creating
a $29 million budget deficit that has forced them to stop provider
payments.
</P>
<P>
   A showdown is scheduled today when those budget changes are
debated by the full House.
</P>
<P>
   Graves called the changes a ``cheap theatrical stunt'' aimed at
disrupting an orderly conclusion to the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am truly disappointed that Democrats and a small group of
Republicans in the Kansas House have made a conscious decision to
hijack the budget process,'' Graves said.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted Rep. Bill Reardon, a Kansas City, Kan., Democrat,
to accuse the governor of using ``theatrical tactics'' by stopping
provider payments and frightening those who depend on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take personal offense at the suggestion that this (budget
deal) is theatrical,'' Reardon said.

 COLOTLAN, Mexico: x x x according to Newsweek.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The authorities who first investigated the case in Guadalajara
and drew up charges against the Huichols said they knew about the
journal but didn't think it was important.
</P>
<P>
   The yellow waterproof journal is listed as one of the items
recovered from the scene. Others were True's passport, credit
cards, camping gear and two books, ``In Cold Blood'' and ``The
Right Stuff,'' among other items.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were dozens of papers in the backpack. We looked at the
journal. There was nothing important there,'' said one of the
prosecutors with the state attorney general's office in
Guadalajara, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   But in Colotlan, prosecutor David Magdaleno Rodriguez did think
the diary was important and made an official motion to read it.
With the help of a translator, Rodriguez said he would pore over it
after it arrives from Guadalajara.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have yet to determine if the diary favors the
prosecution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said he would also request special fiber tests on the
neckerchief True wore. The Huichols said previously they choked the
correspondent with his own neckerchief.
</P>
<P>
   Under Mexican law, a judge has a year from the day of an arrest
to rule on a case, which is done by reading reams of evidence, not
through a U.S.-style trial. In this case, the evidence includes two
volumes of testimony, photographs and two varying autopsy reports.
</P>
<P>
   The two autopsies performed on True offer conflicting results.
</P>
<P>
   The first, conducted in December by Jalisco state coroner Mario
Rivas Souza, concluded True's death was a homicide from
strangulation.
</P>
<P>
   But a second autopsy performed in January by examiners with the
federal attorney general's office in Mexico City concluded True
died from edema in the lungs, an excessive accumulation of fluid,
and from a blow to the head. It also said True had exorbitant
amounts of alcohol in his blood.
</P>
<P>
   Results of the second autopsy have not been released, but Aguiar
allowed the San Antonio Express-News to read and photograph the
report.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two opinions. The federal examiners report is very
clear: there was no asphyxia.'' Aguiar said. ``The state medical
examiner, meanwhile, is categorical that death was due to
strangulation and hypothermia. So we have to determine who is
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a Jalisco state penal code, a third opinion must be sought
when there are two varying accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Aguiar said the next step is finding a forensic specialist to
read the two autopsies and come to a conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of alcohol has been controversial because True was
known as only a moderate drinker.
</P>
<P>
   Medical experts have noted that a body can produce alcohol after
death, especially if it has been outside and decomposing for some
time, as was the case with True.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very delicate case. That's why we have to act with
the utmost care and try to find a forensic specialist who is not
biased in any way,'' Aguiar said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The judge also said the case has been slightly complicated by an
appeal made by the suspects' new attorney, Juan Pedro Salas
Castillo, who is contesting the incarceration of the Huichols while
a judgment on the case is pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law is very clear that a translator be present whenever
the declaration of an indigenous person is taken by the courts,''
Salas said. ``To this date, they have never had an interpreter ...
They speak Spanish, but not 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Salas said the meanings of certain words are different in
Huichol and in Spanish. An example, he said, is the word for neck.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the two had four court-appointed attorneys. Salas is
their first private lawyer, but it was unknown who or what
organization hired him. Salas declined to say.
</P>
<P>
   He conceded the case is becoming more difficult because of the
changing testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``They give me different versions. This makes it very hard to
defend them,'' Salas said. ``But historically this is because they
don't trust outsiders, they don't understand the law and they've
been abused throughout history.''
</P>
<P>
   According to investigators and neighbors who knew Chivarra
before his arrest, the suspect was known as a small-time thug who
stole farm animals from neighbors. One man who knew him in the
village of Amoltita said Chivarra, like many other Huichols of the
Sierra Madre, cultivated small plots of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   But Chivarra denied it, saying he would have been expelled from
the community under Huichol laws.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has no illusions about ever returning to his family.
Though court records say he had a pregnant wife named Yolanda who
reportedly witnessed True's slaying, Chivarra denied that as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not my wife. She's my aunt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chivarra said he thought he would never go free.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I will die here,'' he said. ``I think they will kill
me.''

MICROSOFT LOOKING TO INVENT A BETTER MOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Please note that the word AT in parentheses has been used in
the penultimate graf instead of the symbol, non-transmittable to

<TEXT>
<P>
   A little blue box, just big enough to hold a tub of margarine,
arrived in the mail the other day. What was inside was nearly as
intriguing as the lettering on the outside of the box.
</P>
<P>
   ``In technology, 30 isn't old. It's ancient.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're 30 years old (or older), it's a line that may make you
feel like you're old enough to be sucked from the bowels of the
earth and turned into the next barrel of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
   The box opened on the opposite side of that slogan, and on the
bottom flap was printed another teaser: ``You don't use a computer
that was designed in 1968. ...''
</P>
<P>
   The year is a clue: What we're discussing here was originally
called the ``X-Y Position Indicator for a Display System'' when it
was shown publicly for the first time at the 1968 Fall Joint
Computer Conference in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   It gained patent number 3,541,541 on Nov. 17, 1970.
</P>
<P>
   You know it better by its more descriptive handle: the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, on the inside flap of the box the teaser that began,
``You don't use a computer that was designed in 1968'' was
completed: ``So why use mouse technology that was?''
</P>
<P>
   The contents of the box was a single rubber-coated ball from the
aforementioned pointing technology.
</P>
<P>
   The box was from Microsoft, which, the inside flap said, ``has
thrown out the old parts used to create the mouse _ and will soon
introduce something better. Much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the mouse ball has been ripped out of some pointing
devices before _ although it's still the most common method used
for moving the cursor around the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Some mice use an optical-sensor system popularized by Logitech:
When the mouse is moved, a slotted wheel interrupts a light source
inside the mouse. Depending on how many times the light source is
interrupted determines how far the mouse moves.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1975, Microsoft will eventually move to the
30-and-older group that includes the dinosaur-like mouse it seeks
to redesign. Microsoft officials aren't saying much about the new
mouse, which will be introduced at Spring Comdex 99, a computer
show running April 19-22 in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   With no ball underneath, it will either have to rely on an
optical or sonic system. And since Microsoft has shown a great deal
of innovation in pointing devices over the last two years, it may
even take a major leap forward and use some sort of laser that can
pinpoint its location precisely when used in conjunction with a
special computer mouse pad.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997, Microsoft introduced IntelliMouse, a mouse
that had a small wheel on its back. With it, users could quickly
scroll through a document without moving the mouse. It's gotten
good reviews and it can actually speed up the computing process:
Studies show that it can increase productivity by about 25 percent
when used to review documents and perform other tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft sells about 14 million mice a year and has a lion-size
share of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Spring Comdex 99 may bring forth the mouse that roared.
</P>
<P>
   CHECKING OUT Y2K
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also has a free ``Tools for Y2K Assessment.'' A
company spokesman said the tools, available for download at the
Microsoft Web site (www.microsoft.com/year2000) scans a computer's
hard drive (as well as network drives) searching out Microsoft
products. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It then generates a report with year 2000-compliance
information. If updating is required, the program supplies the
links to Web sites dealing with the products.
</P>
<P>
   It is now available in English and will be available in 14 other
languages by mid-spring. It will also be included in this month's
release of the Microsoft Year 2000 Resource CD.

OLDEN RITE CAN TURN DEVASTATING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) _ From nearly 10 miles away, the orange glow could be
seen across the hills, and the first faint smell of wood smoke
filtered into the car.
</P>
<P>
   We knew immediately that one of the Ozarks' oldest seasonal
rituals was being played out. Along the back roads of our country
neighborhood, resident incendiarists had begun putting a match to
the springtime meadows and woodlands.
</P>
<P>
   They say it kills ticks, makes pasture. It does neither, but
custom and belief are more persuasive than fact. So each year, just
before greening, the fire setters are at work. Or if the spring is
wet and unfavorable for it, they might wait until autumn to torch
the land.
</P>
<P>
   One does well, in those seasons, to sniff the air at night
before retiring, and mark the direction of the wind. Because a
little grass fire, unattended, might find its way to timber. And
mounting up then, generate gale winds of its own, and come whirling
like an orange storm to consume everything before it.
</P>
<P>
   That's not hyperbole. It has happened. You may be sure it will
happen again.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of going directly to the cabin, we drove the gravel
byways to the west and north, where the burning lighted the night.
</P>
<P>
   The breeze of late afternoon had fallen, so the hazard was less.
The line of the fire could be seen creeping slowly down the faces
of the hills. Behind it, the ground was charred black, and hollow
den trees guttered like candles in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   In house clearings as we drove, sometimes we could see the
figures of men, silhouetted against the fire's glow. Had they set
the blaze? Or were they defending their woodland homesteads against
it? There was no way to know.
</P>
<P>
   I remember an April not many years ago _ three or four at most _
when a fire in that neighborhood raged over more than 6,000 acres,
out of control for nearly a week.
</P>
<P>
   The second night, it crested a ridge just to the south _ burning
high as a barn and roaring like some great animal as it advanced on
the house across the road. I could see the flames over the roof; it
came that near.
</P>
<P>
   Then, from nowhere it seemed, truckloads of men appeared with
backpack sprayers and rakes and somehow turned it back. Otherwise
it would have taken the neighbor's house and, vaulting the road,
burned my cabin, too.
</P>
<P>
   I know conservation and wildlife people insist there's a place
for fire _ managed fire _ in forest and prairie ecology. And I
don't doubt the truth of that. But still I fear fire for what I've
seen it do, and nearly do.
</P>
<P>
   The conflagrations that sweep across that reach of country are
not, for the most part, /{managed/} affairs. Some are set
maliciously, some for thrills. More often they escape through
carelessness, or by the rotten luck of a suddenly rising wind.
</P>
<P>
   They are a surviving relic from generations ago _ a time when
hills scalped for their timber were overgrown with a nightmare
jungle of sprouts. Lacking any mechanical or chemical means of
contending with that growth, the early Ozarkers resorted to fire.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday I met a young neighbor as he was leaving in his pickup
for work. He told me he'd fought fire until 2 o'clock in the
morning _ and showed it by his haggard look. When finally they'd
stopped it, he said, it was only two turns up the road.
</P>
<P>
   There are other ways now to clear the land and keep it open.
Much has changed. But cultural memory is powerful, and the habit of
seasonal burning is very old.
</P>
<P>
   Each spring, we smell that history on the night air, and pray
it's not too near.

AN ENVIRONMENTALIST ON A DIFFERENT PATH

<P>
   MADISON, Wis. _ On the short flight from Chicago on a clear cold
day, the descent into Madison is not a bad way to begin to
understand William Cronon and the ideas that have made him a
pivotal and provocative figure in the growing field of
environmental history.
</P>
<P>
   Spread out below is the landscape of Cronon's childhood, where
he hiked and camped and spent summers at his grandparents'
lake-front cottage _ the fields and farms, woodlands and
subdivisions, the city intertwined with its lakes, where he sees
humans inextricably entangled with nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like a landscape that reminds one of those connections,'' he
said in an interview. ``Much as I love wilderness and much as I
love Manhattan, I'm conscious when I'm in those places that it's
hard to see how Manhattan is implicated in Yosemite or how Yosemite
is implicated in Manhattan.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, he said, they very much are.
</P>
<P>
   At 44, Cronon is one of the most influential figures in
environmental history, the study of what Americans have done to and
thought about the natural world, a field founded on the belief that
human history cannot be understood without its natural context.
</P>
<P>
   A Rhodes scholar and former MacArthur fellow who gave up tenure
at Yale to return home in 1992 and teach at the University of
Wisconsin, he is a generator of ideas that have repeatedly shaken
up the ways people think about nature.
</P>
<P>
   In a field that grew out of the environmental movement, he
defies easy political labeling. He is a member of the board of
governors of the Wilderness Society, but several years back he
alienated many environmentalists by publishing an essay critiquing
the very idea of wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   He is also a slightly unorthodox member of the group of new
Western historians who have rewritten the history of the American
West, a mentor to many younger scholars and the author of several
prize-winning and strikingly literary books that have become
staples of history reading lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill's real influence is that his work often gets translated
into a larger American history,'' said Richard White, a Western and
environmental historian at Stanford. ``He has taken what is a
subfield of American history and made it part of the basic
literature of American history itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Cronon's first book, ``Changes in the Land: Indians, Colonists
and the Ecology of New England'' (Hill &AMP; Wang, 1983), looked at the
way plant and animal communities in colonial New England changed in
the shift from Indian to European dominance. It revealed not only
the profound ways in which a people's ideas about property shape
their environment but also the fact that even the Indians had not
lived passively on a pristine landscape.
</P>
<P>
   His second book, ``Nature's Metropolis: Chicago and the Great
West'' (W.W. Norton, 1991), a history of the relationship between
19th-century Chicago and its hinterland, is credited with having
radically widened many environmental historians' gaze beyond such
things as forests and public lands to include cities and what
Cronon calls the ``elaborate and intimate linkages'' between city
and country.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1995, he published the essay called ``The Trouble With
Wilderness,'' which appeared in The New York Times Magazine and the
next year in a book he edited. In it he challenged the
environmental movement's focus on wilderness as an ideal. He called
the dream of an untouched landscape a fantasy of people who had
never had to work the land for a living and suggested it posed ``a
serious threat to responsible environmentalism at the end of the
century.''
</P>
<P>
   He wrote, ``The flight from history that is very nearly the core
of wilderness represents the false hope of an escape from
responsibility, the illusion that if we can somehow wipe clean the
slate of our past and return to the tabula rasa that supposedly
existed before we began to leave our marks on the world.'' That
leaves little room, he continued, for figuring out ``what an
ethical, sustainable, honorable human place in nature might
actually look like.''
</P>
<P>
   Many environmentalists remain infuriated by the essay. They
accuse Cronon of misunderstanding the conservation movement,
ignoring biology and caring too little about the political
consequences of his critique. They accuse him of such sins as
relativism and anthropocentrism, ceding to human beings too
prominent a place in the hierarchy of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must confess I'm getting a bit grumpy about the dumb
arguments being put forth by high-paid intellectual types in which
they are trying to knock Nature, knock the people who value Nature
and still come out smelling smart and progressive,'' Gary Snyder,
the poet and environmentalist, wrote in Wild Earth in an issue of
the wilderness-protection quarterly that was devoted to answering
Cronon.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after Cronon's essay appeared, he was invited to join the
Wilderness Society's governing council, in part because its
chairman at the time, Christopher Elliman, thought Cronon could
carry on the society's tradition of fostering original thinking
about wilderness while also nudging the environmental movement
forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is, we're so implicated in nature that you can't
just stop now,'' said Michael Pollan, an author who writes
frequently on environmental topics and who admires Cronon's work.
``Once you've changed the world, you have a responsibility to stay
involved. Then the issues get much harder: How do you weed a
wilderness? Do you encourage fire? Do you set fire?
</P>
<P>
   ``You get into all these gray areas where Bill is happy to go
and that I find very exciting to think about. But most
environmentalists, who may be shrewder politically than we are,
know that it's a very hard place to go, and you're going to get
into all sorts of trouble. It's so much easier to say, `Lock it up
and throw away the key' with a piece of land.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very invested in a stark opposition between nature and
culture,'' he added. ``And Bill is interested in breaking that
down. That breaks a lot of china, too; it goes to the heart of
Americans' ideas about nature.''

</P>
<P>
   Environmental history first took shape in American universities
in the late 1960s and early '70s as younger historians interested
in environmentalism began emerging from graduate school
dissatisfied with what their elders were calling history.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Worster, a 57-year-old historian at the University of
Kansas whom many see as the dean of the field, recalled in an
interview that when he was a graduate student at Yale, every
American historian in the department seemed to be working on one of
two topics, Puritanism or slavery. He picked Puritanism, then got
sick of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had grown up on the Great Plains,'' said Worster, the author
of books on the Dust Bowl and water supply in the American West,
among others. ``For me, things like climate and grasses and the
memory of bison didn't seem to have much to do with the
imaginations of my mentors. They didn't seem to be aware that those
things had any significance.''
</P>
<P>
   But the field's relationship with the movement has grown
strained, some historians say, as scientists have realized that
natural systems are not as predictable as popular notions about the
``balance of nature'' once implied, and as historians have shown
that human beings were manipulating ecosystems as far back as any
record or evidence extends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually all early environmental historians considered
themselves environmentalists,'' White said. ``Most still do. But
precisely because so much environmental history is pointing out the
problems with naive ideas about nature and untouched pristine
lands, there has come to be a sense that we're not fully to be
trusted. And I guess in some sense we aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   A tall man with a youthful lope, angular face and preference for
well-worn flannel shirts, William Cronon grew up mostly in Madison.
From his father, E. David Cronon, a political historian and former
dean at the university, he inherited his historian's predilection
for asking, upon encountering almost anything, how it got to be the
way it is.
</P>
<P>
   From his mother, Jean Cronon, he says he acquired a passion for
nature. He remembers an endless series of nature activities, like
rock collecting, instigated by her, and a fifth-grade vacation in
the family station wagon, circumnavigating the West from the Grand
Canyon to the Black Hills, that was one of the formative
experiences of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father's library is full of biographical books, which is
typical of scholars of his generation,'' Cronon said one afternoon,
his legs dangling over the arm of a chair in a campus office.
``Whereas the dominant thing that operates in my mind is landscape.
I think in maps, actually. I tend to ask how these places came to
be the way they are.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his earliest research projects occurred in his junior
year in high school. Using original land records from the 1830s, he
reconstructed the presettlement vegetation of a Wisconsin county.
``I was just endlessly fascinated by the notion that a landscape is
a palimpsest, these layers that can be peeled off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He entered the University of Wisconsin as an undergraduate
thinking he might be a quantitative plant ecologist or a novelist;
drifted toward geology; alighted in medieval studies; won a Rhodes
scholarship to study Old English and Old Norse, and then, in his
senior year at Wisconsin, walked into a course on the history of
the American West, taught with an environmental focus, that
convinced him that would be his field.
</P>
<P>
   He spent his two years at Oxford doing a research project on
Coventry and how shifts in energy consumption affected this English
town's social life and political economy. His paper earned him a
Ph.D. Then he headed off to Yale to study with Howard Lamar, at
that time the best-known graduate teacher of Western history.
</P>
<P>
   For his dissertation topic, he chose Chicago. Feeling he had
failed in Coventry to look at the coal fields that had given the
town its economic life, he decided to study the interaction between
Chicago and its hinterland over a long sweep of time, and the
environmental and economic links that arose.
</P>
<P>
   Then Lamar became the dean of Yale College, creating an opening
on the faculty for a Western historian. Though only a graduate
student, Cronon got the job. He was 27. He received tenure in 1988
before completing his dissertation, having already published
``Changes in the Land,'' which had begun as a paper for a seminar
during his first year at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, a year after the publication of the ground-breaking
``Nature's Metropolis,'' Cronon accepted his current job as a
professor of history, geography and environmental studies. He and
his wife, Nancy Fey, returned home to raise their two children near
their grandparents and to settle in the part of the world that has
so profoundly shaped Cronon's thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Passing through O'Hare Airport around the same time, Richard
White, the Stanford historian, recalls having noticed a businessman
beside a baggage-claim carousel reading ``Nature's Metropolis.'' He
remembers thinking, ``What I would give to have a guy like that
reading one of my books.''

 A little levity helps the bottom line  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) _ Should we wonder why April Fools' Day and Fun at
Work Day are the same day?
</P>
<P>
   Naaaah.
</P>
<P>
   They're not related. Nobody's going to come up in the middle of
your Fun at Work Day party and say: ``Just kidding. Everybody back
to work.''
</P>
<P>
   What's that? You're not having a Fun at Work Day party? Well,
send out for a pizza, quick. Ask them to spell out ``fun'' with the
pepperoni.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies actually are having Fun at Work Day parties. If
you're driving by the Sprint building at 8140 Ward Parkway between
11 a.m. and 1 p.m. today, you'll see the parking lot beach party.
</P>
<P>
   That party and activities at other Sprint locations are little
interludes designed to relieve stress and keep morale up, said
Traci Mendez, Sprint marketing manager for new business development
and a Fun at Work organizer.
</P>
<P>
   Around the work world, more organizations are sending the
message that fun and work aren't mutually exclusive. At least, they
shouldn't be.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Weinstein, motivational speaker and author of /{Work Like
Your Dog/}, created Fun at Work Day four years ago. He wanted to
spread the word that you can take your work seriously without
always being sober about it. In other words, ``fun at work'' isn't
an oxymoron.
</P>
<P>
   Some workplaces didn't need Weinstein to tell them that a little
levity goes a long way toward enhancing productivity, and retaining
and attracting workers. There are work sites that build
celebrations into their workdays and encourage spontaneous
``disruptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Many other workplaces desperately need a Fun at Work Day
infusion, though. I repeatedly hear of workers berated by bosses
who heard laughter coming from a cubicle or conference room. Oh,
no! They were laughing!
</P>
<P>
   If that's a workplace crime, give me the arsenic now.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent career planning seminar given by Les Griffen, who
several years ago entered the career counseling industry after
losing a longtime corporate job, he shared his process of
self-discovery, his transition from career ladder to
entrepreneurship.
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized that he made less money than he used to but that
it didn't matter. He is having a blast. He loves what he does. It
doesn't even feel like work.
</P>
<P>
   People stuck in jobs they hate with people they dislike can't
imagine that work can be fun. It may take the kind of
self-discovery Griffen preaches. It may take the kind of
concentrated public relations gimmick Weinstein used to launch Fun
at Work Day.
</P>
<P>
   But the important message is that individuals can create their
own fun. If you're sure your employer would never allow fun _ my
sincere condolences _ Weinstein says it is possible to sneak some
in.
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking rent-a-carnival here. We're talking little
gestures that slowly build atmosphere. Weinstein suggests ordering
(or bringing from your garden) a bouquet. Give it to a co-worker to
enjoy, with the understanding that in half an hour, he or she must
pass it on to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   After an eight-hour day, 16 persons will have had a
day-brightener for a while, plus the knowledge that someone else
appreciates them. And that's more fun than a lot of workers usually
get at work.
</P>

 &HT;    Astride two cities, Jomandi's Jones goes for `Slam' dunk
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 4.
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's 10 a.m., his messages are waiting, he's looking
for his coffee mug, he's trying to get ready for rehearsal. Another
part of his mind is on the trip to Disney World he'll take with
Angeline, his 3-year-old daughter, as soon as ``Slam,'' his new
musical drama set in a nightclub poetry slam, opens Friday in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Another mellow day in the life of Thomas W. Jones II has begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, don't bother me with that,'' cries the director to a
Jomandi Productions staffer asking his decision on a business
matter. ``I'm Florida-bound, man! I got carnivals to go to! I got
bears to see!
</P>
<P>
   ``So this is being an adult,'' Jones adds, flopping down in his
chair in Jomandi's converted-warehouse offices in northeast
Atlanta, as if the day has already defeated him. ``I hate it!''
</P>
<P>
   Jones lets out a laugh _ he's kidding, of course. He's laughing
at his own expense, since his autobiographical ``Hip 2: Birth of
the Boom'' (1994) suggested that ``being an adult'' is a fairly
recent development in the life of this ever-cool, earring-wearing
bachelor of 42. Afro Jo, the Everyman character he portrayed in
that musical play, writhed in anguish when he learned that his
girlfriend had aborted their child. Seeing that play helps one
understand the depth of joy that Jones feels today, finally, as a
father, sharing custody of Angeline with her mother, his former
companion.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a chronic kidder, is also kidding
</P>
<P>
   about being overwhelmed. Having his mind in many places at once
is nothing unusual for this na-
</P>
<P>
   tive New Yorker who founded Jomandi with Marsha Jackson-Randolph
20 years ago. He's Atlanta's most versatile theater artist, skilled
as actor, director, playwright, composer and critical observer of
the art form. While plays that Jones has written and/or directed
for Jomandi since 1990 _ ``Wizard of Hip,'' ``Hip 2,'' ``Bessie's
Blues'' _ have been well-received in other cities, it's in
Washington that he's found his second artistic home. He simply can
do no wrong there. The Studio Theatre, a D.C. playhouse with a
racially mixed audience, invites him back again and again, gigs
that have earned him Helen Hayes Awards in the past and may again.
He is nominated as actor (in ``Waiting for Godot'') and director
(``Seven Guitars'') this year. The awards will be presented May 3.
He'll open ``Slam'' at the Studio on June 9.
</P>
<P>
   While Jomandi has had its share of letdowns at home in recent
seasons (``Keep the Faith,'' Jeff Stetson's bio-musical about Adam
Clayton Powell), Jones seems to get his warmest notices when he
takes Atlanta artists to collaborate with their D.C. brethren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington does not have a Jomandi (a theater run by, and
primarily for, African-Americans), and that's a great frustration
in a city with so many fine black artists,'' says Bob Mondello, who
covers D.C. stages for the weekly City Paper and the arts beat for
National Public Radio, suggesting that Jones helps fill a need for
black-written, black-directed work. ``Beyond that, Tom's simply a
critics' darling up here. Everything he does jumps off the stage at
you.''
</P>
<P>
   A tale of two cities
</P>
<P>
   It can be a bit disorienting, Jones says, after being praised by
The Washington Post and hobnobbing with D.C.'s arts luminaries at
the Kennedy Center, to return to Atlanta, where his accomplishments
are still a well-kept secret in some quarters, especially among
white audiences. He's not a local crossover celebrity on the level
of, say, Kenny Leon, artistic director of the much larger Alliance
Theatre. And yet Jones is arguably just as accomplished nationally,
earning his first positive New York Times review (for 1990's
``Wizard of Hip'' off-Broadway) the same year Leon's Alliance debut
was praised in Time magazine. In fact it was Jones who gave Leon
some of his breakthrough acting jobs at Jomandi in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than grouse about his visibility, Jones stays in
character and makes it a joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can come back from D.C. and say to folks, `See? I'm not an
idiot!'' Jones cries, once again laughing at his own expense. ``I
have reviews! I am loved!''
</P>
<P>
   The Amherst (Mass.) College grad, a doctor's son who moved to
Atlanta as a teenager in the '70s and returned after college with
then-sweetheart Marsha Jackson to start Jomandi, says he's never
been seriously tempted to move to Washington despite his standing
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aside from the fact that I love Atlanta, I'd always rather do
something (premiere an original work) at Jomandi first, without the
pressure of that media spotlight,'' Jones says, sitting down with a
mug of coffee at the prop bar on ``Slam's'' rehearsal set. ``The
seduction (of larger cities) can be dangerous. I mean, if The New
York Times comes the first night and says it's a piece of
(expletive), then for the foreseeable future it remains (that) in
the eyes of the rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, that infectious, nothing-rattles-me laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Back to his poet's roots
</P>
<P>
   Starting out on familiar, friendly ground is important for
``Slam,'' Jones says, for a couple of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   It profiles a group of itinerant poets _ ``spoken word artists''
ranging from an angry black male of hip-hop rhythm to an older
white woman with a lyrical bent _ and Jones is taking a huge risk
by writing all their diverse verse. Poetry was his first vocation,
out of college. But when he submitted some of his verses to poet
Sonia Sanchez, his professor and mentor, ``Her comment was, `Not
everybody has to write for a living, you know.' ''
</P>
<P>
   This memory brings another self-deprecating laugh from the
artist. But he's confident in his ability to capture eight
different voices. He's done his homework. Prowling poetry clubs in
Atlanta (Mekka, Red Light Cafe, Yin Yang Music Cafe) and other
cities, Jones was struck by the rhythmic riffs, the spontaneous
versification of controversial, hot-off-the-press issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody in the club might throw out an idea,'' he says, ``and
there's a competition, everyone improvises on it, like jazz artists
working a theme.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Chandra Currelley, who plays the role of the
proprietress of the ``Slam'' club, can trace the show's roots to
the '80s, when Jones listened to her _ the performer with the
larger-than-life voice and persona _ sing at Walter Mitty's, a
Midtown club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom used to watch my set from the corner table _ my table, I
called it, because he knew that's where I'd go to sit on my
break,'' she says with a chuckle. ``Mitty's was the kind of
intimate place where I'd have to be careful how I breathed or the
cigarette smoke from the guy in the front row would go right up my
nose!
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see Tom was computing something in his brain, even
while joking around,'' Currelley adds. ``He's grown as an artist
but in some way is still that same crazy Tom. One day he said, `I'm
writing a show for you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That's a key to Jones' success: his ability to grow original
material organically, so to speak, from the talents around him. He
saw that Atlanta singer-actress Bernardine Mitchell was, physically
and vocally, the incarnation of Bessie Smith and voila _ ``Bessie's
Blues.'' He took specifics of his own life and _ boom _ created a
universal black male, Afro Jo, hero of ``Wizard'' and ``Boom.''
</P>
<P>
   Big changes, catching hell
</P>
<P>
   In just the past year, however, Jones has looked beyond the
African-American experience to examine its relationship to other
communities. In a sense, he's feeling a similar pressure to
``respond to a changing, multicultural America'' (his words) that
Leon and his mostly white Alliance board have struggled to
negotiate for the past decade. Jones and Jomandi co-director
Jackson-Randolph agreed that it was important to reach out with
last fall's ``Kiss of the Spider Woman.'' Not only was it a
production whose principal artists were Latino (with just one black
co-star), but its theme of homosexuality is, Jones says,
``especially controversial in the black community.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones was not shocked by the reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I caught hell,'' he says simply. ``I got lots of calls, split
about 50-50, with some people saying, `Hang in there' and others
saying, `How dare you?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Jones was undaunted, and ``Slam'' is the proof. Its eight poets
are white, black, Latino. They range in age from veterans of the
Beat Generation to members of the hip-hop generation. Their
subjects range from political power to sexual power (or both, in a
segment based on a ``stripper poet'' that Jones once witnessed).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about collision of cultures and ideas _ that's what's
so exciting about the poetry scene today,'' says Jones. ``I want
people to come to the show and examine their own dream cells.''

 &HT;    The patchwork of a family treasure

   ATLATNA _ Americans rediscovered the art of quiltmaking in 1976,
during the bicentennial. That's when Joe Carter started hearing
about a quilt that someone in his family had made that was in a
museum somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The idea intrigued him, because growing up in Baltimore, all he
had known about his roots was that his mother, Janie Powers Brown,
had been born in Atlanta at Grady Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's mother told him that her people were gathering in
Athens because a researcher was trying to find descendants of this
famous quilter. But his mother never made it there, and while
Carter pestered her to find out more about the quilt, she never
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a seeker,'' explains Carter, who eventually moved to
Atlanta, where he worked with singer Curtis Mayfield and
established a civil rights organization called Creative Community
National Network for Youth and Family Survival.
</P>
<P>
   Today, on the anniversary of the murder of the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr., Carter celebrates the legacy of civil rights
leaders who went before. He calls it Remnants Day, from the
biblical term for the people of God left behind in a foreign
country to continue good works.
</P>
<P>
   On Remnants Day in 1996, Carter received a newspaper article
showing some of his distant relatives with the Harriet Powers quilt
at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. It was the quilt he had heard
about for so many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sort of like the Alex Haley situation in reverse,''
says Carter, 46. ``He found his history and wrote a book. And all
of a sudden, I walk into a situation where my
great-great-grandmother is quite possibly one of the most famous
quilters in the country. ... All of a sudden, we were brought into
the circle.''
</P>
<P>
   He organized a group of 10 Powers descendants to see her other
quilt, at the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of American History,
in the same section that houses the flag that inspired ``The
Star-Spangled Banner.''
</P>
<P>
   They stared at the quilt and saw in it the source of Carter's
songwriting ability, his sister's knack for sewing a wedding gown
without a pattern, his son's interest in making montages of sports
heroes, his daughter's interest in violin and dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like everybody saw something passed down to them from
her,'' says Joe Carter Jr., 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are part of a strong thread that has survived,'' adds Aisha
Carter, 22.
</P>
<P>
   Carter is awestruck that a Harriet Powers quilt will be on
display in Atlanta starting this week. But distance has not
diminished the power her work has exacted on his life. He's sure of
one thing, no matter where the quilts reside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harriet,'' he says, ``is still speaking to us.''

 &HT;    Historic quilt a feather in Atlanta's cap
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 4.
 &HT;    By Michelle Hiskey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Freed from slavery at age 29, Harriet Powers moved
with her family to a small farm near Athens and began to stitch a
spiritual tapestry for herself and her loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   With cotton scraps of blue and brown, orange and white, she cut
out simple figures that even her three children could recognize
from the fiery sermons they heard every Sunday at the local Baptist
church. She depicted Jesus and Jacob and Job as silhouettes among
stars and circles, diamonds and crosses, arranging them in a
fashion much like the needlework of her West African ancestors. She
couldn't read or write, but told her stories in cloth and thread.
</P>
<P>
   Powers died in 1911, not living long enough to see her work
displayed in the Smithsonian Institution, well before she became
the most famous quilter in a country where that art form has become
a warm and touchable symbol of its melting-pot history. The two
surviving quilts made by Harriet Powers are so treasured by the
museums that own them that, despite constant requests, they are
rarely even photographed, much less lent out.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Powers' second Bible quilt will go on display at the
Atlanta History Center, where it will be on view for two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for people in the quilt world, no one understands what
a coup it is for Atlanta to get this,'' says Anita Weinraub,
co-curator of the ``Georgia Quilts: Piecing Together a History''
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time in a century that a Powers quilt has been
shown in her home state, although her descendants in Georgia
haven't felt distant from her. Even across the miles, they say, her
work continues to touch them spiritually. In her quilts, they see
the heartbreaking sacrifice of an illiterate ex-slave forced to
give up her greatest treasure. And by doing that, she saved it.
</P>
<P>
   Of sacrifice and salvation
</P>
<P>
   Harriet Powers' heroes were the biblical survivors, characters
such as Noah who had persevered through great crises. She featured
them prominently in her first quilt, which she called ``A Sermon in
Patchwork'' and proudly displayed in 1886 at a fair, near the
biggest watermelon and tallest corn stalk.
</P>
<P>
   A young white art teacher offered to buy the quilt for $10. But
Powers was adamant; her quilt was not for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, when economic depression fell across Georgia,
the 53-year-old Powers and her husband, Armstead, wrapped the
precious quilt in two sacks, loaded it into their oxcart and took
it to the art teacher's house.
</P>
<P>
   This time the woman didn't have $10; she could pay only $5.
</P>
<P>
   Powers didn't want to let the quilt go, but Armstead insisted
that they needed the money. So, with great heartache, she struck
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next years, she would return to visit what the teacher
called ``the darling offspring of her brain'' and would receive a
commission from a group of Atlantans to create a second, even more
detailed Bible quilt.
</P>
<P>
   One panel of the quilt shows the hand of God hovering over Adam
and Eve. And it almost seems as if providential guidance kept the
quilts miraculously preserved over the next century.
</P>
<P>
   The first guardian angel was the white art teacher, Jennie O.
Smith. She later marveled, ``I have spent my whole life in the
South, and am perfectly familiar with 30 patterns of quilts, but I
had never seen an original design, and never a living creature in
the patchwork, until the year 1886.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith persuaded Powers to tell her the stories behind the
quilt's 11 panels. She learned that Powers had room for only six
disciples in her Last Supper, and that she surrounded her Judas
with 30 green calico circles representing pieces of silver.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was clearly charmed. Satan, she noted, ``is not as I first
thought, a football player. I am sure I have never seen a jauntier
devil.''
</P>
<P>
   Those descriptions are almost as remarkable as the quilt itself.
Very few quiltmakers left behind any documentationabout the meaning
or inspiration behind their work.
</P>
<P>
   For four years during the 1990s, Weinraub traveled through
Georgia looking for historic quilts. She found more than 8,500, but
very few from the 1800s. Only about 3 percent were made by
African-Americans. Those facts make Powers' work even more
significant, apart from its providing an interpreted storyboard of
an oral tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's part of the beauty and value of Harriet Powers'
quilts,'' Weinraub says. ``We know what she meant by it all.''
</P>
<P>
   `We were just floored'
</P>
<P>
   In 1895, Smith displayed the Powers quilt at the Cotton States
Exposition in Atlanta's Piedmont Park, where it caught the eyes of
some Atlanta University professors' wives. They wanted such a quilt
as a gift for the chairman of their board of trustees, the Rev.
Charles Cuthbert Hall of New York. Through Smith, the women
commissioned Powers to make them a more elaborate quilt.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three years, Powers sewed 15 panels, expanding her
subjects to include celestial phenomena that happened before her
birth, such as a dark day caused by a forest fire in 1780 and a
meteor shower in 1833. She also depicted an olive-colored hog named
Betts that, legend has it, ran 500 miles home.
</P>
<P>
   Someone, whose name is unknown, recorded her interpretation of
these blocks on small pieces of cardboard, and they stayed with the
quilt as it was passed down to Hall's son, whose estate sold it to
folk art collector Maxim Karolik. In 1964, Karolik donated his
collection to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. That was about the
same time the executor of Jennie Smith's estate packed up her
Powers quilt and 18 pages of notes and sent them to the Smithsonian
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   When the national museum's textile experts opened the box, they
immediately recognized it as a major find: the King Tut's Tomb of
American quiltmaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just came in the mail and we opened it and we were just
floored,'' recalls Doris Bowman, a 35-year veteran of the
Smithsonian. ``It was so different from anything we had ever
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Many experts in the field talk about the two quilts as one
creation. ``It certainly has an aura about it,'' says Boston Museum
of Fine Arts curatorial assistant Lauren Whitley, an authority on
the quilt that's coming to Atlanta. ``That's what strikes me _ that
it was so prized to her and she wanted to keep it close, and the
most amazing thing is it probably wouldn't have survived if it
hadn't been sold. There must have been a special guiding light
looking out for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian's Museum of American History displayed the quilt
without knowing much about it. ``Made by an ex-slave named
Harriet,'' read its caption in the museum, where a young folklore
professor from the University of Maryland would drop by every
Saturday. Gladys-Marie Fry would sit on a little bench and ``visit
with Harriet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It appeared to have so many layers of meaning and different
elements, and I wanted to try to figure out what it meant,'' says
Fry, who launched the first academic study of the Powers quilts.
</P>
<P>
   Fry's research connected the circles, crosses and diamonds with
symbols used by the Kongo people of West Africa to celebrate
relationships between the living and the dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like an onion,'' Fry says. ``The outside peel, that was
Christianity. Under that are all these beliefs in the Kongo system.
And I think there's more to it. God only knows what's underneath
the rest of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even as we speak, I envision her in heaven, smiling as we try
to break the code.''
</P>
<P>
   A treasure kept in a vault
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston has 35,000 objects in its
textile collection. The Powers quilt is the most popular of them,
and a thick file folder is stuffed with requests to reproduce its
image in textbooks, documentaries and even children's books. It has
never been lent out before.
</P>
<P>
   Whitley says the quilt's value places a heavy burden on the
museum to protect it for posterity. Staff members don white lab
coats and gloves whenever they handle it, because even a speck of
sweat could turn into a stain years later. After it is displayed,
the quilt is wrapped in acid-free paper and stored for at least
three years in a special vault kept constantly at 68 degrees and 50
percent humidity.
</P>
<P>
   A conservator from Boston will accompany the quilt to Atlanta as
it is shipped in a special padded canister suspended in a
custom-made wooden crate. In Atlanta, it will be displayed behind
plexiglass, in low lighting, with special ultraviolet filters to
ensure that the fragile cotton doesn't fade.
</P>
<P>
   Freeing this masterpiece from its Boston cocoon hinged on the
persistence and connections of Betsy Weyburn, former textiles
curator at the history center. An Atlanta quilt exhibit two decades
ago included a poster of Powers' work, but Weyburn wanted to do
better than that. A lot better.
</P>
<P>
   She had just helped the Costume Society of America put on a
meeting in Atlanta, and through that volunteer job she had met
Elizabeth Ann Coleman, the Boston museum's new textiles curator.
Weyburn knew the museum would view more kindly a request that came
from someone who was familiar and who could vouch for its
safekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to be a crime that it hadn't been shown here,'' says
Weyburn. ``Sometimes I'm an eternal optimist. I knew it was a small
chance and believed we would get it.''
</P>
<P>
   In October, the Boston museum board approved the two-month loan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They couldn't say no,'' Weyburn says, ``to sending it home.''

 &HT;    North Carolina aims to prove art, economic development can mix
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 4.
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker

<P>
   Asheville, N. C.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Anderson slows her long maroon Chrysler to a crawl in
downtown Waynesville. Unlike many small towns of 7,000, where the
action has moved from the old town centers to the strip malls,
downtown Waynesville is bustling. The search for parking is just
the first hint.
</P>
<P>
   She finds a spot just in front of a small newsstand chock-full
of newspapers from across the South and around the country, along
with periodicals such as Art in America and Opera News. It's the
kind of corner newsstand you'd expect to find in New York City, not
a small mountain town.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, 58, bounds from the car. She draws a bright red
sweater coat around her shoulders and sets out on her favorite
circuit. First she clips over to the Burr Studio and Gallery, but
potters Dane and MaryEtta Burr aren't in yet. So it's on to the
Whitewoven Handweaving Studio and Gallery for a ``how's biz'' chat
with weaver Sheree Sorrells.
</P>
<P>
   Then down the street to check out a new gallery called Twigs and
Leaves that folks are buzzing about. ``Hi,'' Anderson says, hand
extended to owner David Erikson as soon as she enters the door.
``I'm Becky Anderson with HandMade in America. I've heard so much
about you.''
</P>
<P>
   Erikson's eyebrows pop up and he hurries from behind the counter
to greet her. ``I just put a letter in the mailbox for you moments
ago,'' he says. His wife, Kaaren Stoner, abandons her potter's
wheel in the back and practically stammers to explain, ``Your
organization is one of the main reasons we moved here.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple, who came from Ohio eight months ago, greet Anderson
as if a muse has taken form before their eyes. And to many artists
and civic leaders in Western North Carolina, she is just that.
</P>
<P>
   `Let's build on our culture'
</P>
<P>
   Though she makes no clay vessels, stitched quilts or hand-blown
glass, Anderson is a crafter nonetheless. Through her organization,
HandMade in America, she has shown how economic and cultural
development can be woven together into a new kind of community.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Haywood County, Anderson is a local farm girl who
grew up ready for challenge. She has tackled civil rights and
community development issues in South Georgia, East Tennessee and
Ohio. But she came back to North Carolina when she realized that
``who you are is where you're from, and where you're from is where
you are going.'' She says the line with a twinge of mountain twang,
then admits to stealing it from her brother, novelist Fred
Chappell, who is North Carolina's poet laureate.
</P>
<P>
   For 12 years Anderson worked as an industrial recruiter for the
Asheville Area Chamber of Commerce, trying to lure manufacturers
into the region _ virtually a mission impossible given the
mountainous terrain, poor or restricted roads, sensitive watersheds
and large swaths of national parks and forests that are off-limits
to development. Anderson began to realize, she said, that
``traditional economic and industrial recruiting simply (wasn't)
going to work for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   What might work, she realized, were pots turned and shaped by
clay-caked hands, rugs woven by the push and pull of a wooden loom,
and baskets of river cane reeds and honeysuckle vine laced by the
fingers of Cherokee and Appalachian makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make Western North Carolina the center of handmade
objects in the country,'' said Anderson, comparing it to the
development of Santa Fe, N.M., as a mecca of galleries and art
studios in the Southwest. ``We have about 20 million visitors a
year, drawn here by the beauty, the recreational activities like
hiking and rafting, the arts, the music and the crafts. Those are
our assets. Let's build on our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   So, six years ago, she founded HandMade in America, along with a
small group of like-minded business, civic and cultural leaders, to
help support and promote the estimated 4,000 artists and
craftspeople in Western North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson cultivated an appreciation of crafts in the process of
acquiring an eclectic collection of pieces ``that all have meaning
to me because of my connection to the person who made it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her most prized possessions are two coverlets, one deep navy and
the other deep red, made by her grandmother, who raised the sheep,
made and dyed the wool and then wove the two large pieces, while
living on the Haywood County farm that Anderson still owns (and
farms tobacco on). One coverlet will soon hang on the wall of her
new office; the other will stay in the Asheville home she shares
with her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger quarters are needed for HandMade because, in six years,
it has grown to encompass everything from helping artists get
small-business loans to helping towns find funds for such civic
projects as riverwalks.
</P>
<P>
   A weird form of tourism
</P>
<P>
   During the first two years, Anderson and company took stock of
the local crafts industry. An exhaustive assessment, which showed
that it accounted for $122 million in 1994, formed the basis of
HandMade's 120-page guidebook ``Craft Heritage Trails of Western
North Carolina.'' The popular book helps travelers and art lovers
find more than 100 home studios, galleries and other local
treasures.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time anyone in the region had tried to draw
connections between the weaver on her farm, the potter down the
road a bit and the art gallery in town. At first, said Anderson,
artists were reluctant. ``(Bringing) people onto private
property,'' she admits, ``is a real weird way to do tourism.''
</P>
<P>
   Artists were asked to list regular business hours, put their
names on their mailboxes and create exterior doors to their studio
spaces. The advantage, they were promised, would be more time spent
in their studios and less time selling their wares at craft shows
and fairs.
</P>
<P>
   Sorrells, the weaver in Waynesville, was among the early
skeptics, mainly, she said, because similarly ambitious efforts had
always met with choruses of ``no, that won't work'' from the wider
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, this has worked,'' said Sorrells, who works in a
second-floor studio on Main Street in Waynesville. ``Tourists, and
even some local folks, come up all 27 steps with that little book
in their hands.'' The result is more commissions from local people
and studio visitors ``than in the past 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The guidebook has surpassed all expectations. ``I lived in fear
that 25,000 copies of it would sit in the office for 25 years,''
Anderson said. But it sold out in 18 months, and a second edition,
with nearly 200 listings, was recently published.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson borrowed the idea from the National Trust for Historic
Preservation, which had created heritage trails in Wisconsin, Texas
and Tennessee. Because of her success, she's now in demand as
something of a heritage trail expert.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson recently traveled to Hawaii to advise on ``sugar
heritage'' trails and talked with Los Angeles residents as they
created a variety of trails focusing on ethnicity and architecture.
A contingent from Tibet recently stopped by Anderson's office to
learn more about the concept.
</P>
<P>
   Still more is in the works: HandMade is sponsoring a new
guidebook to garden and hiking trails, and the North Carolina
tourism office is working on trails for indigenous music and
Cherokee Indian heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Regional effort takes off
</P>
<P>
   Drawing connections did more than direct tourist to artist; it
helped draw artists together and connected them with schools and
agencies, with business and civic leaders. And then artists and
leaders from different towns began to talk, and soon a true
regional development effort was in bloom.
</P>
<P>
   Towns such as Bakersville, which had been left out of the first
book, began to call Anderson about how they could be included and
get help in their efforts to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson heard about how Bakersville and Mars Hill, an old
college town, were interested in putting their utility lines
underground. She knew that Marion, which was within an hour of both
places, was doing that.
</P>
<P>
   Chimney Rock wanted tourists at its namesake landmark _ a large
rock overhang with beautiful views of the mountains _ to linger
awhile. Anderson knew that neighboring Black Mountain, with its
historic college and business district thriving with craft shops
and galleries, had become a popular detour for recreational
visitors lodging in Asheville.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the towns were too small _ Chimney Rock only about 100
residents, Bakersville about 600 _ to have a city planner or
manager or the aid of the state's Main Street Program, which helps
towns of 5,000 people or more. So, in 1996, Anderson created the
Small Town Revitalization Program, with the financial backing of a
$450,000 grant from the Pew Partnership for Civic Change.
</P>
<P>
   The program started with six towns and is growing to 10. Matched
with larger, ``sister'' towns, such as Waynesville, the smaller
places learn how to solve specific community problems, whether it's
how to get street lamps on Main Street, build a walkway by the
river or write a sign ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has lined up training in grant writing and planning
issues and worked to expose the town leaders to an array of
resources. ``Of course,'' she notes, ``sometimes the trick is
convincing someone in Washington that a loom is an economic
development tool.''
</P>
<P>
   She spends so much time _ phoning up agencies from the
Appalachian Regional Commission to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, dashing off to various meetings across the region and
toiling away on weekends writing grants and letters _ that she
recently told U.S. News &AMP; World Report magazine that her goal is
``to have a weekend all to myself.''
</P>
<P>
   `This isn't the mall'
</P>
<P>
   It's folks like Ronnie McKinney in Bakersville who see the
dividends of such effort. ``We actually had an entire busload of
people representing philanthropic groups across the country come to
Bakersville, thanks to HandMade,'' said McKinney, a retired
educator and town volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   Bakersville has recovered from a flood with the help of
donations and volunteer cleanup efforts from sister cities, built a
trail beside the town creek and studied planning issues such as
burying utility lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to preserve this as a nice place to live and
avoid indiscriminate development with houses all over the
mountainside and strip malls,'' McKinney said. It's an all too
present threat. Within the past few months, Wal-Mart has announced
plans to build near Bakersville and neighboring Spruce Pine,
prompting a flurry of town meetings. Some residents are eager for
the convenience; others fear damage to locally owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``HandMade has helped us buy into the idea of developing the
arts and crafts that are traditional in this area, which will bring
visitors in, support the artists and the small businesses, and not
have a major environmental impact,'' McKinney said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees. Some environmentalists refer to HandMade's
efforts as ``industrial tourism'' and deride the concept because it
depends so heavily on bringing automobiles through the mountains.
Some of HandMade's heritage trails crisscross the Blue Ridge
Parkway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, the parkway was designed for cars. But now we know that
one-third of the pollution in our mountains comes from
automobiles,'' said Garrett Smathers, a member of the Western North
Carolina Alliance. ``We need to try to reduce that impact as much
as we can. The parkway is a very fragile umbilical cord between the
Shenandoah Valley and the Smoky Mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   Others see a place for handmade crafts in economic development
as long as it avoids the ``tourist trap'' syndrome. ``There's no
need for us to create a Snuffy Smith village. And we don't want to
be Helen, Georgia,'' declared Ronald Huelster, executive director
of the Downtown Waynesville Association.
</P>
<P>
   Huelster believes in promoting what the town naturally has. And
since Waynesville joined the Main Street program in 1986, leaders
have made sure that local crafts and arts, along with antiques,
have played a major part in their promotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't the mall,'' said Huelster. ``This isn't Everywhere
USA. Here you can purchase something from an artist or craftsperson
and learn something about what went into the piece and who made it,
and that makes it different. That's the only way a downtown can
compete with a Wal-Mart.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeking out small towns
</P>
<P>
   Stoner and Erikson were looking for an arts-friendly place to
settle when a friend told them about the guidebook. They ordered
the book from HandMade's Internet site, www.wnccrafts.org, loved
it, visited the region and began looking for a community to adopt.
Huelster's willingness to help _ ultimately finding the space for
their gallery and apartment _ was crucial in their choice of
Waynesville.
</P>
<P>
   ``The support of craftsmen was critical in our decision,'' said
Erickson. ``This is a community of universal support for art.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, artists have shown that they're more than
willing to return community support. They've built benches in
Bakersville and helped teachers in Waynesville devise ways to use
crafts to teach mathematics and science.
</P>
<P>
   ``Artists were undervalued as citizens,'' Anderson said. ``Now
they are on planning boards in these small towns. I like to refer
to my board as the ties and the tie-dyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Together, the various planning boards of HandMade and in the
towns are kicking out more innovative ideas every day. A new
program has been launched to create gardens that grow the raw
materials artists need, with the first at the North Carolina
Arboretum in Asheville. Abandoned schoolhouses are being renovated
to become incubator studios and apartments for artists, with the
first in Graham County likely to be opened this year. A computer
registry of the region's 4,000 artists is being compiled by
partners at Haywood Community College. And plans are under way to
build a pottery studio atop a landfill near Burnsville in Yancey
County, and use the landfill's waste methane gas to fire the kiln.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Anderson sees HandMade as the product of tradition
as much as the arts and crafts it supports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in this century, women in Western North Carolina did
just this very thing,'' she said, referring to institutions such as
the Southern Highland Craft Guild, the John C. Campbell Folk School
and the Penland School, which were all created (with large
influence by women) to promote traditional crafts and arts as an
important part of the cultural and community life in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson believes that, though the region could gamble on
hot-trotting high technology or try to lure more manufacturing, its
best bet is on what's already there. And what is there, ultimately,
is what more and more people want. ``There's a reason people are
moving from the big cities into our small towns up here,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She rattled off a few: to sit on the front porch and talk to
their neighbors face to face, not through e-mail. To hear the feet
stompin' with the music, not filtered through a computer. To spend
their time in the garden rather than in the car.
</P>
<P>
   And to ``put their hands on things made by hand.''

 &HT;    Message of Rebirth
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He has risen.
</P>
<P>
   Those three words shook the Roman Empire. They ignited a
worldwide religious movement. And they continue to grip billions of
people today.
</P>
<P>
   But 2,000 years after the followers of Jesus greeted one another
with this joyful proclamation, Christians disagree more than ever
about its meaning.
</P>
<P>
   As Christians worldwide observe Easter this Sunday (Eastern
Orthodox Christians celebrate it April 11), the central message of
Christianity's holiest day _ the resurrection of Jesus _ is coming
under increasing doubt.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of liberal Christians and scholars do not
believe that Jesus rose bodily from the grave. For them, the
resurrection is symbolic: Jesus' teachings live on despite his
brutal death.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be irrelevant to me if we would discover the skeletal
remains of Jesus,'' said Marcus Borg, co-author of ``The Meaning of
Jesus'' (HarperSanFrancisco, 192 pages, $22). ``The central meaning
of Easter is Jesus is Lord and Jesus is a divine reality now one
with God.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are other Christians who say that belief in the bodily
resurrection of Jesus is essential to Christianity. What's at stake
with them is not simply an answer to an academic debate. It is the
very identity of Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If how Jesus lived is all that matters and if Jesus simply
died like all other humans, (then) Christianity is nothing more
than imitating a dead guy from the past,'' said Luke Timothy
Johnson, a professor of religion at Emory University and author of
``Living Jesus'' (HarperSanFrancisco, 224 pages, $22).
</P>
<P>
   The biblical portrayal of Easter does little to clear up the
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the crucifixion of Jesus, there were no witnesses to
Jesus' resurrection. The Resurrection stories vary from each Gospel
and, in some cases, contradict one another. For example, in the
Gospel of Matthew, Jesus appears first to Mary Magdalene. But
Luke's account says Jesus appeared first to Peter.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the core of the Resurrection stories remains the same. They
proclaim that on the third day after Jesus was crucified, he
appeared to his disciples alive. The Gospel of John even depicts
Jesus eating with his followers and inviting one doubting disciple
to place his fingers into one of the wounds caused by his
crucifixion.
</P>
<P>
   The Apostle Paul declared that the Resurrection is the axis that
the Christian faith revolves around.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless
and so is your faith,'' Paul declared in the First Book of
Corinthians.
</P>
<P>
   But John Dominic Crossan, a retired DePaul University religion
professor, argues that accounts of great men rising from the dead
were too common in the ancient world to spark a new religious
movement. Crossan, a leader of the controversial Jesus Seminar and
author of ``The Birth of Christianity'' (HarperSanFrancisco, 653
pages, $20), said the followers of Jesus probably saw an apparition
of Jesus after his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not pathological; it's part of the grieving process,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the disciples' reflection on their experiences with Jesus
before Easter that inspired them to proclaim Jesus as Lord after
his death _ not a vision of the risen Jesus, Crossan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had so integrated their lives with Jesus that it was
almost impossible for them to break with him now,'' Crossan said.
</P>
<P>
   Emory's Johnson said no ``poltergeist experience'' can explain
the birth of Christianity. Only an encounter with a ``living
Jesus,'' he thinks, can explain how the same terrified disciples
who deserted Jesus during his crucifixion became a group of
death-defying Jesus proclaimers within a week.
</P>
<P>
   Easter's message isn't that the example of Jesus' life lives on,
but that Jesus literally lives and is still experienced by people,
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Christians say today is that Jesus is still powerfully
alive. That's why Christians gather. For classical Christianity,
Easter is not three days after the death of Jesus. It's every day
after the Resurrection,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Though debate swirls over the events surrounding the
Resurrection, a Newsweek magazine poll released this month said
that 88 percent of Christians still believe in the Resurrection.
Such belief, however, is interpreted in various ways.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Albert Wingate, the pastor of the Atlanta Unity Church
in Roswell, doubts that Jesus rose literally from the grave, but he
still believes in Easter because he said it teaches people that ``a
resurrection process is taking place in all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Wingate said God raised him from his own death _ years spent as
an alcoholic before becoming sober.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beyond me how I can lay down my body and pick it up
again,'' Wingate said. ``But I can certainly see the times when I
was in that tomb of darkness. What really brought me out of it was
literally a resurrection when I realized half-measures weren't
going to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Tinsley, however, believes in Jesus' bodily resurrection.
For Tinsley, host of a radio gospel show on WVEE-FM (V-103), it
proves that if God would not desert Jesus on the cross, he won't
desert anyone else when they bear their own cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you step out on faith, God always gives you a platform to
stand on,'' Tinsley said. ``If you believe that, if you trust that,
you'll never fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his intensive study of Easter, Borg said it would be a
mistake to try to pin down what happened on the first Easter
morning. The Resurrection, like any sacred mystery, cannot be
explained with words, Borg said. Only faith will do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we try to domesticate God with excessive certitude
when we insist that the tomb was really empty and God transformed
the corpse of Jesus,'' Borg said. ``But it points to a mystery that
escapes our ordinary language.''

 &HT;    KOSOVO COST ESTIMATES: $400 MILLION AND RISING
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-COSTS-DATA. For release Sunday, April 4.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The NATO bombing assaults on Yugoslavia are costing
up to $40 million a day, and a prolonged air campaign will cost the
United States billions of dollars, military budget experts predict.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns over the expense of the Balkan conflict have been
secondary as the Clinton administration has confronted its growing
urgencies. Moreover, accurate cost estimates are all but
impossible, with the extent and duration of the military action
unknown and humanitarian relief costs soaring as hundreds of
thousands of refugees are forced out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the cost of the Balkan operation has been compared with
that of Desert Fox, the recent bombing campaign against Iraq. That
operation cost a ``guesstimated'' $500 million, said Chris Hellman,
senior analyst with the Center for Defense Information.
</P>
<P>
   Hellman put the cost of the Kosovo military campaign, which
began March 24, at $20 million to $40 million a day, nearly all of
which has been borne by the United States. That does not include
relief aid that the United States and other countries are rushing
into the region. President Clinton pledged Wednesday to send $50
million in emergency assistance for the Kosovar refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The most evident costs are the tons of bombs exploded in the
region. Already, the U.S.-led forces have launched an estimated 100
cruise missiles, which cost $1 million apiece to replace.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest single loss, the downed F-117 Stealth fighter plane,
is more difficult to evaluate. The radar-evading fighter jet cost
$45 million when it was built in the 1980s, but the plane is no
longer in production, and the Air Force has no plans to replace it.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hundreds of sorties in the Balkans, none has been as
expensive as those flown by B-2 stealth bombers. The planes went
into battle for the first time, with flights of two planes carrying
their 16 one-ton bombs from their home base in Missouri across the
Atlantic on two successive nights.
</P>
<P>
   The planes cost $2.2 billion each. When the cost of the bombs
they carry ($63,000 apiece) are included, the B-2 bombing sorties
cost $1.6 million each, according to Hellman's estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the B-2 is also extremely costly to service and
requires about one week of maintenance for each bombing run. The
plane is so sensitive that it must be stored in a
climate-controlled hangar to protect its radar-evading surface.
</P>
<P>
   The costs of the planes and bombs would almost certainly be
overshadowed if the United States sent more troops into the region.
During the Persian Gulf war, most of the expense was in
transportation, housing, and extra pay for personnel, said Liesl
Heeter, senior budget analyst at the Center for Strategic and
Budgetary Assessments. The center has estimated that keeping 4,000
U.S. peacekeeping troops in Kosovo would cost $1 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   The expense of the current Kosovo conflict far exceeds the
Defense Department's budget, requiring the military to ``borrow''
from other defense operations until Congress approves supplemental
funding. As Heeter described it,
</P>
<P>
   ``They are taking money out of Peter's pocket to pay Paul. Then
they go to Congress and ask them to repay Peter.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers have consistently balked at setting aside a
contingency fund for war-making. ``Congress wants to retain the
authority to declare war,'' Heeter said, even as she acknowledged
that Congress has, in effect, turned over much of that power to the
president.
</P>
<P>
   A few months from now, the administration will request the extra
money for the Kosovo operation, and Congress will almost certainly
pass it. ``That's sort of the game that's played,'' Heeter said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that the cost to the Pentagon will be counted not just
in dollars, but in how it affects the military's already struggling
efforts to recruit and keep personnel. A military action can
attract new recruits, but it can also repel them if the risks are
great, if the deployments drag on too long, or if the Pentagon
relies too heavily on some units.
</P>
<P>
   On this intangible cost, ``there's not a clear, neat answer,''
Heeter said.

   KOSOVO-MILOSEVIC (Belgrade) _ Slobodan Milosevic is riding above
the fray, while his army and his police are capturing (or
abducting) American soldiers, shooting down an invisible airplane,
and expelling ethnic Albanians from Kosovo in numbers beyond any
Washington policymaker's most embarrassing nightmares. While NATO
is pounding his country from the air, Milosevic, portly and

ethnic Albanians and talking of peace. His military seems to be

lawmakers missed their court-imposed deadline of this Thursday to

confidently when or how it will all end. The Democratic governor
has vowed to veto any income tax, and teachers are beginning to
receive warning slips that next fall's jobs are in question. But
one fact has emerged clearly from the muddle: New Hampshire no
longer seems such a granite monolith of anti-tax sentiment. By

PRISONERS OF WAR CAN COMPLICATE WHITE HOUSE DECISIONS IN WAR  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 4)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL And ERIC ROSENBERG

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Images of captured Americans are bombarding the
American public once again, putting the bruised faces of GIs on the
distant war in Yugoslavia for the first time and potentially
affecting U.S. policy decisions there.
</P>
<P>
   The move by Yugoslav authorities to put the three captive U.S.
Army soldiers on trial is like to intensity U.S. interest in a war
that has previously seemed remote, confused and irrelevant to
American interests.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, President Clinton _ like the last five presidents
before him _ now must carve out foreign policy while tending with
newly inflamed domestic political currents.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Larson, author of a 1996 Rand Corp. study on U.S.
casualties and public opinion from World War II to Somalia in the
early 1990s, says prisoners of war and casualties ``rivet the
attention of policy makers, the press, and the public until the
issue is resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Enemy seizure of U.S. troops ``can backfire on adversaries,''
Larson says, adding: ``The expectation is that hostages or
casualties will lead to a decline in support. But in fact, in many
cases it tends to stiffen resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, public support for a military operation would
decline if the mission is murky and the price too high, according
to Joseph Collins, a retired Army colonel and former special
assistant to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   Former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, a retired Air
Force lieutenant general who served President George Bush at the
White House, said he favors an aggressive fight-to-win strategy in
Yugoslavia but is worried that American casualties may erode public
support for any sustained U.S. military operation.
</P>
<P>
   Scowcroft said news media coverage of family reaction to U.S.
casualties in Yugoslavia would magnify the emotional costs of U.S.
involvement there and contribute to public impatience.
</P>
<P>
   A CBS News survey released on Friday found that 35 percent of
those questioned favored increased U.S. military action in Kosovo
in the wake of the soldiers' capture, 44 percent supported keeping
operations at their current level and 9 percent favored decreasing
U.S. operations.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-three percent of the respondents said that developments
in Yugoslavia were important to U.S. interests.
</P>
<P>
   Concern about the fate of the soldiers led to Clinton's decision
Friday to personally address their plight for a second time in two
days.
</P>
<P>
   The president abandoned evasive diplomatic legalisms to publicly
label the trio prisoners-of-war who are ``entitled to all the
protections that come with that status.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton emphasized: ``There is absolutely no justification for
putting them on trial or displaying them in public in violation of
the Geneva Convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the Geneva Convention, a formal designation
of the soldiers as POWs frees the Yugoslavs to legally hold the
troops until the end of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said the U.S.-led allied
offensive against Yugoslav forces would not be redirected in
response to the capture of Army Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 24,
of Los Angeles; Army Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths
Creek, Mich.; and Army Spec. Steven M. Gonzales, 24, of Huntsville,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav authorities said investigators were beginning to
assemble evidence against the three troops with an eye toward
prosecuting them before a military tribunal.

   Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R.
Ford were shadowed by questions over the treatment and finally the
release of American armed forces captured and held during and after
the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   The plight of 2,069 GIs missing in action in Vietnam, including
some who were being held by communist forces, remains a touchy
political issue in American politics.
</P>
<P>
   President Jimmy Carter saw his re-election drive in 1980
sidetracked by Iran's seizure of the American embassy in Teheran in
1979 and the subsequent 444-day captivity of 52 American diplomatic
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   President Ronald Reagan was faced with the kidnapping of
Americans in the Middle East by Islamic militants. Reagan became so
determined to get the hostages released that his top subordinates
launched an arms-for-hostages deal with Iran that triggered the
appointment of a special prosecutor and clouded the final years of
Reagan's eight-year presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Bush dealt as vice president with the capture of Marine Lt. Col.
William R. Higgins _ and as president with the execution of Higgins
who was seized by Islamic militants in southern Lebanon in 1987 and
executed in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton endured a trial by fire at the outset of his own
presidency, when guerrillas loyal to Somali warlord Mohammed Farah
Aidid battled an elite force of U.S. Army Rangers in Mogadishu,
killing 18 soldiers, wounding more than 70 and capturing downed
Blackhawk helicopter pilot Army Chief Warrant Officer Michael
Durant.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent video footage televised nationwide in the United
States showed Durant's captors interrogating the frightened
32-year-old pilot. Aidid freed Durant 10-days after his capture.

<P>
   MADISON, Wis. _ On the short flight from Chicago on a clear cold
day, the descent into Madison is not a bad way to begin to
understand William Cronon and the ideas that have made him a
pivotal and provocative figure in the growing field of
environmental history.
</P>
<P>
   Spread out below is the landscape of Cronon's childhood, where
he hiked and camped and spent summers at his grandparents'
lake-front cottage _ the fields and farms, woodlands and
subdivisions, the city intertwined with its lakes, where he sees
humans inextricably entangled with nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like a landscape that reminds one of those connections,'' he
said in an interview. ``Much as I love wilderness and much as I
love Manhattan, I'm conscious when I'm in those places that it's
hard to see how Manhattan is implicated in Yosemite or how Yosemite
is implicated in Manhattan.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, he said, they very much are.
</P>
<P>
   At 44, Cronon is one of the most influential figures in
environmental history, the study of what Americans have done to and
thought about the natural world, a field founded on the belief that
human history cannot be understood without its natural context.
</P>
<P>
   A Rhodes scholar and former MacArthur fellow who gave up tenure
at Yale to return home in 1992 and teach at the University of
Wisconsin, he is a generator of ideas that have repeatedly shaken
up the ways people think about nature.
</P>
<P>
   In a field that grew out of the environmental movement, he
defies easy political labeling. He is a member of the board of
governors of the Wilderness Society, but several years back he
alienated many environmentalists by publishing an essay critiquing
the very idea of wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   He is also a slightly unorthodox member of the group of new
Western historians who have rewritten the history of the American
West, a mentor to many younger scholars and the author of several
prize-winning and strikingly literary books that have become
staples of history reading lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill's real influence is that his work often gets translated
into a larger American history,'' said Richard White, a Western and
environmental historian at Stanford. ``He has taken what is a
subfield of American history and made it part of the basic
literature of American history itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Cronon's first book, ``Changes in the Land: Indians, Colonists
and the Ecology of New England'' (Hill &AMP; Wang, 1983), looked at the
way plant and animal communities in colonial New England changed in
the shift from Indian to European dominance. It revealed not only
the profound ways in which a people's ideas about property shape
their environment but also the fact that even the Indians had not
lived passively on a pristine landscape.
</P>
<P>
   His second book, ``Nature's Metropolis: Chicago and the Great
West'' (W.W. Norton, 1991), a history of the relationship between
19th-century Chicago and its hinterland, is credited with having
radically widened many environmental historians' gaze beyond such
things as forests and public lands to include cities and what
Cronon calls the ``elaborate and intimate linkages'' between city
and country.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1995, he published the essay called ``The Trouble With
Wilderness,'' which appeared in The New York Times Magazine and the
next year in a book he edited. In it he challenged the
environmental movement's focus on wilderness as an ideal. He called
the dream of an untouched landscape a fantasy of people who had
never had to work the land for a living and suggested it posed ``a
serious threat to responsible environmentalism at the end of the
century.''
</P>
<P>
   He wrote, ``The flight from history that is very nearly the core
of wilderness represents the false hope of an escape from
responsibility, the illusion that if we can somehow wipe clean the
slate of our past and return to the tabula rasa that supposedly
existed before we began to leave our marks on the world.'' That
leaves little room, he continued, for figuring out ``what an
ethical, sustainable, honorable human place in nature might
actually look like.''
</P>
<P>
   Many environmentalists remain infuriated by the essay. They
accuse Cronon of misunderstanding the conservation movement,
ignoring biology and caring too little about the political
consequences of his critique. They accuse him of such sins as
relativism and anthropocentrism, ceding to human beings too
prominent a place in the hierarchy of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must confess I'm getting a bit grumpy about the dumb
arguments being put forth by high-paid intellectual types in which
they are trying to knock Nature, knock the people who value Nature
and still come out smelling smart and progressive,'' Gary Snyder,
the poet and environmentalist, wrote in Wild Earth in an issue of
the wilderness-protection quarterly that was devoted to answering
Cronon.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after Cronon's essay appeared, he was invited to join the
Wilderness Society's governing council, in part because its
chairman at the time, Christopher Elliman, thought Cronon could
carry on the society's tradition of fostering original thinking
about wilderness while also nudging the environmental movement
forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is, we're so implicated in nature that you can't
just stop now,'' said Michael Pollan, an author who writes
frequently on environmental topics and who admires Cronon's work.
``Once you've changed the world, you have a responsibility to stay
involved. Then the issues get much harder: How do you weed a
wilderness? Do you encourage fire? Do you set fire?
</P>
<P>
   ``You get into all these gray areas where Bill is happy to go
and that I find very exciting to think about. But most
environmentalists, who may be shrewder politically than we are,
know that it's a very hard place to go, and you're going to get
into all sorts of trouble. It's so much easier to say, `Lock it up
and throw away the key' with a piece of land.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very invested in a stark opposition between nature and
culture,'' he added. ``And Bill is interested in breaking that
down. That breaks a lot of china, too; it goes to the heart of
Americans' ideas about nature.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Environmental history first took shape in American universities
in the late 1960s and early '70s as younger historians interested
in environmentalism began emerging from graduate school
dissatisfied with what their elders were calling history.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Worster, a 57-year-old historian at the University of
Kansas whom many see as the dean of the field, recalled in an
interview that when he was a graduate student at Yale, every
American historian in the department seemed to be working on one of
two topics, Puritanism or slavery. He picked Puritanism, then got
sick of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had grown up on the Great Plains,'' said Worster, the author
of books on the Dust Bowl and water supply in the American West,
among others. ``For me, things like climate and grasses and the
memory of bison didn't seem to have much to do with the
imaginations of my mentors. They didn't seem to be aware that those
things had any significance.''
</P>
<P>
   But the field's relationship with the movement has grown
strained, some historians say, as scientists have realized that
natural systems are not as predictable as popular notions about the
``balance of nature'' once implied, and as historians have shown
that human beings were manipulating ecosystems as far back as any
record or evidence extends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually all early environmental historians considered
themselves environmentalists,'' White said. ``Most still do. But
precisely because so much environmental history is pointing out the
problems with naive ideas about nature and untouched pristine
lands, there has come to be a sense that we're not fully to be
trusted. And I guess in some sense we aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   A tall man with a youthful lope, angular face and preference for
well-worn flannel shirts, William Cronon grew up mostly in Madison.
From his father, E. David Cronon, a political historian and former
dean at the university, he inherited his historian's predilection
for asking, upon encountering almost anything, how it got to be the
way it is.
</P>
<P>
   From his mother, Jean Cronon, he says he acquired a passion for
nature. He remembers an endless series of nature activities, like
rock collecting, instigated by her, and a fifth-grade vacation in
the family station wagon, circumnavigating the West from the Grand
Canyon to the Black Hills, that was one of the formative
experiences of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father's library is full of biographical books, which is
typical of scholars of his generation,'' Cronon said one afternoon,
his legs dangling over the arm of a chair in a campus office.
``Whereas the dominant thing that operates in my mind is landscape.
I think in maps, actually. I tend to ask how these places came to
be the way they are.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his earliest research projects occurred in his junior
year in high school. Using original land records from the 1830s, he
reconstructed the presettlement vegetation of a Wisconsin county.
``I was just endlessly fascinated by the notion that a landscape is
a palimpsest, these layers that can be peeled off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He entered the University of Wisconsin as an undergraduate
thinking he might be a quantitative plant ecologist or a novelist;
drifted toward geology; alighted in medieval studies; won a Rhodes
scholarship to study Old English and Old Norse, and then, in his
senior year at Wisconsin, walked into a course on the history of
the American West, taught with an environmental focus, that
convinced him that would be his field.
</P>
<P>
   He spent his two years at Oxford doing a research project on
Coventry and how shifts in energy consumption affected this English
town's social life and political economy. His paper earned him a
Ph.D. Then he headed off to Yale to study with Howard Lamar, at
that time the best-known graduate teacher of Western history.
</P>
<P>
   For his dissertation topic, he chose Chicago. Feeling he had
failed in Coventry to look at the coal fields that had given the
town its economic life, he decided to study the interaction between
Chicago and its hinterland over a long sweep of time, and the
environmental and economic links that arose.
</P>
<P>
   Then Lamar became the dean of Yale College, creating an opening
on the faculty for a Western historian. Though only a graduate
student, Cronon got the job. He was 27. He received tenure in 1988
before completing his dissertation, having already published
``Changes in the Land,'' which had begun as a paper for a seminar
during his first year at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, a year after the publication of the ground-breaking
``Nature's Metropolis,'' Cronon accepted his current job as a
professor of history, geography and environmental studies. He and
his wife, Nancy Fey, returned home to raise their two children near
their grandparents and to settle in the part of the world that has
so profoundly shaped Cronon's thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Passing through O'Hare Airport around the same time, Richard
White, the Stanford historian, recalls having noticed a businessman
beside a baggage-claim carousel reading ``Nature's Metropolis.'' He
remembers thinking, ``What I would give to have a guy like that
reading one of my books.''

U.S. TO OFFER RUSSIA $100 MILLION TO KEEP NEW STATION ON TRACK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, April 4) 
 
By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The United States will offer Russia another $100
million this week in an attempt to keep the international space
station project on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly, the money will purchase a three-man Soyuz crew
capsule to serve as an additional temporary lifeboat during the
final stages of station assembly, a range of ground-based equipment
that could be used at the Johnson Space Center in Houston to train
spacewalking astronauts and other station-related gear useful to
NASA.
</P>
<P>
   But the real objective, NASA administrator Dan Goldin told
Congress recently, is to keep the more crucial Russian
contributions to the new station from slipping further behind
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia's fiscal realities continue to impede the Russian Space
Agency's ability to deliver its substantial contributions to the
international space station in a timely manner,'' Goldin testified,
referring to the financial crisis in the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The key issues that NASA intends to address this week in Moscow:
</P>
<P>
   _ The launching of the Russian service module, which is to
furnish the living quarters and life support for the new station's
first crew of astronauts and cosmonauts.
</P>
<P>
   Lagging 17 months behind schedule because of flagging Russian
finances, the service module is scheduled for a Sept. 20 liftoff.
Those within NASA who track its progress envision setbacks for the
module during the final months of fabrication and ground testing.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, they believe it could be launched from Central Asia
before the year is out.
</P>
<P>
   _ Russia's fabrication of the Soyuz rockets, Soyuz crew capsules
and Progress cargo ships, a less visible issue though one that is
vital to the first few years of the international station's
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The new outpost requires a pair of Soyuz capsules annually to
serve as lifeboats while they are docked. Three propellant-laden
Progress capsules are needed annually to fuel the propulsion
systems that will keep the new station at safe altitudes above the
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for Progress capsules will grow to six annually after
the turn of the century, though NASA began making plans to take
over responsibility for future propellant requirements in response
to last year's Russian financial collapse.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Mir space station. The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration wants the still occupied, 13-year-old outpost safely
ditched by September because it competes with the international
station for scarce Russian government funding.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians are in the final weeks of a so far unsuccessful bid
to find a private source of funding to keep Mir operating for
several more years.
</P>
<P>
   Russian emotions run high for the preservation of Mir, but the
country's space agency has pledged to the United States that the
aging outpost will not interfere with commitments to the
international station.
</P>
<P>
   In his appearance before Congress, Goldin said his agency is
prepared to follow $60 million in payments to Russia last fall with
$100 million in 1999 NASA funding.
</P>
<P>
   He noted, however, that a plan to direct a total of $660 million
to Russia over several years has been shelved. There is no station
funding for the Russians in the proposed NASA 2000 year spending
plan now before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators must approve any funding agreements reached between
the two space agencies.
</P>
<P>
   If an agreement is reached, the latest monies would flow in
installments as part of a purchase contract linked to carefully
monitored milestones with regard to Mir and the service module,
space agency officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The more than five-year effort to assemble the new station began
last November with the launching of the first component aboard a
Russian Proton rocket from Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. shuttle astronauts successfully joined a second component
in December. The unstaffed components are circling the Earth at an
altitude of about 250 miles, their electronic systems watched
closely by ground control teams in suburban Moscow and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. shuttle supply mission to the fledgling outpost is
planned for May. But there is a backlog of U.S. components awaiting
the arrival of Russia's 21-ton service module, whose launching date
slipped from July to September earlier this year, its third slip.
</P>
<P>
   During the portion of the upcoming meeting called the general
designer's review, NASA will be looking for assurances that the $60
million it forwarded to Russia last year helped to assure a service
module launching this year.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for those funds, NASA obtained partial use of the
service module to conduct U.S.-sponsored research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, we want to come out of the general designer's review
with an understanding that Mir is coming down in the
August/September time frame,'' said Dan Hedin, chief of staff in
NASA's Washington space station development office. ``We need a lot
higher confidence as to when the service module is going to be
delivered and a clear understanding of their financial
capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   As the two agencies prepare to convene, the service module is
nearing a point in its ground testing that it can be transported by
rail from its Moscow factory to the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Russia's
launch complex in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   The service module should reach Baikonur around May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Once it reaches Baikonur, engineers will install the antenna for
a communications system, satellite navigation equipment and a
docking radar. Those components will require about 30 additional
ground tests to complete the module's pre-launch checkout.
</P>
<P>
   ``With those exceptions, the testing so far has been good,''
said Hedin.
</P>
<P>
   Once in orbit, the Russian service module will become a passive
docking target for the station's first modules. Once linked, the
newest module will provide living and working quarters for three.

CHINA TRIES TO BOOST ECONONY WITH MUNICIPAL PROJECTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, CHINA _ Construction teams still work around the clock
in China's largest city, one sign among many that the nation's
overall economy is defying predictions by outsiders who expected it
to sputter this year.
</P>
<P>
   In a telling shift, however, construction workers are putting up
fewer of the office and apartment buildings that had sprouted like
weeds in the boom years of the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they are working on municipal projects like an elevated
highway, a new subway line and a new airport, part of China's
enormous spending program aimed at preventing the economy from
weakening too seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about slowing export growth, falling foreign investment
and declining domestic demand, Beijing spent nearly $200 billion on
public construction projects last year and plans to do the same
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Government spending may be all that is keeping construction
workers from joining China's growing ranks of unemployed, and it
indeed appears to be contributing to a major portion of China's
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I don't see a slowdown,'' said Huang Wenzhong, vice
president of the Shanghai Construction Group, the city's largest
builder, which says it earned $2.5 billion in 1998 and expects to
earn about the same this year. ``We're still extremely busy.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, China has escaped the economic crisis that has gripped
much of Asia. China's growth rate reached 7.8 percent in 1998 and
is expected to reach at least 7 percent this year. The reasons for
that growth go beyond the government's ambitious spending program.
</P>
<P>
   China's capital markets are highly restricted and not vulnerable
to the financial swirl that tugged currencies downward in other
countries. The steady exchange rate of China's currency, the yuan,
has helped insulate the economy from outside jolts.
</P>
<P>
   Currency traders all over the world regularly recycle rumors
that China may devalue its currency. That would help the Chinese
increase their exports by making them cheaper abroad, but could set
off a round of potentially destabilizing currency devaluations in
other struggling countries that are trying to increase their
exports.
</P>
<P>
   There is little sign, however, that China's currency will be
devalued anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Wu Xiaoling, governor of the Shanghai branch of the People's
Bank of China, said there was no serious pressure for a
devaluation, reiterating a pledge by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji that
no devaluation would come this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wu also asserted that a large number of bad loans troubling
China's state-run banks would be offset by the growing economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be able to solve all problems caused by nonperforming
loans,'' she said in an interview in late March.
</P>
<P>
   The official optimism cannot hide long-term challenges. Among
them is China's wrenching transition from a planned to a
market-oriented economy. Chinese companies must contend with price
controls, currency-conversion restrictions and contradictory
instructions from the Communist Party about how to privatize, a
term that still seems to scare officials here.
</P>
<P>
   As speed gathers in the worldwide trend toward electronically
connected markets that value efficiency, flexibility and speed, the
insistence by Chinese officials that they will take a slow approach
to change raises the risk that China's integration into the world
economy will endure many setbacks. So far, that is a risk that
Chinese officials are willing to take.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to open our capital markets anytime soon,''
said Huang Qifan, director of the Shanghai Economic Commission.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Huang expressed confidence that China would be able to grow
steadily with limited access to sources of international capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``China has an enormous domestic market,'' he said. ``I think
China can grow at 5 percent or more for the next 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Huang, the construction magnate, who is no relation to Huang,
the official, also predicted that China would maintain a firm
growth rate in the immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the economy will be stable,'' he said. ``Foreigners
should not worry about that. If we're satisfied, they should not
worry. Living standards are rising every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think living in Shanghai now is so much worse than in
Hong Kong or New York. You can buy whatever you want in the stores.
I see it in my family; we used to have 19-inch television sets, now
we have 34-inch sets. My house has three. I don't see any causes of
instability. In a few years, everyone will be buying cars.''

AS BIG GAINS INCREASE THE BITE, MORE FUNDS TRY TO OFFSET TAXES 
</HEADLINE>

 (ART ADV: Graphic on performance of tax-managed funds on pre-tax
and after-tax basis is being sent to NYT graphic clients.

603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)  
 (bl)  
 By ABBY SCHULTZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tax-managed mutual funds _ those that seek to maximize after-tax
gains rather than gross returns _ are among the latest trends in
the fund industry. More than half the 22 such funds tracked by
Morningstar Inc. were introduced after 1996, and combined assets in
them have grown from $3.19 billion to $15.36 billion over that
period.
</P>
<P>
   Already this year, tax-managed funds have been introduced by
American Century Investments, Prudential Investments and SunAmerica
Asset Management. The Vanguard Group has added a
small-capitalization fund to its lineup of three tax-efficient
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Although still only an investment niche, tax-managed funds may
be more than a passing fancy. Investors are paying more attention
to the effects of taxes on their investment returns, industry
officials say. That is largely because years of bull-market
performance, combined with last summer's steep sell-off, have
alerted them to the big capital gains tax hits they may need to
take.
</P>
<P>
   George Sauter, a managing director of Vanguard, said such funds
would gain popularity as more people understood the benefits of
tax-efficient investing. ``It's largely an education issue,''
Sauter said.
</P>
<P>
   The funds' popularity may well grow if the Securities and
Exchange Commission decides to require the disclosure of after-tax
returns in funds' annual and semiannual reports, an idea that it is
at least kicking around. Some investors would surely be startled by
the bite taxes take from their fund returns.
</P>
<P>
   As some tax-managed funds succeed in beating their plain-vanilla
rivals, they are beginning to generate some positive publicity. A
study done last fall by KPMG on behalf of the fund company Eaton
Vance found that funds with a history of tax-efficient management
performed better _ both before and after taxes _ than most general
domestic stock funds for the 10 years through Dec. 31, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, tax-managed funds _ which have benefited lately from
holding large-capitalization stocks _ returned a pretax 22.1
percent annually on average, for the three years ended Feb. 28,
according to Morningstar data, compared with 16.4 percent for the
average U.S. diversified stock fund. After federal taxes, however,
assuming that investors are in the highest bracket, tax-managed
funds had a far wider lead, returning 21.3 percent a year on
average over that period versus 13.6 percent for the average
diversified stock fund.
</P>
<P>
   The tax-managed funds generally share several characteristics.
The main idea of the funds is to minimize taxes by keeping
distributions of ordinary income, as well as capital gains, as low
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   When gains are taken, managers sell shares that will incur
long-term gains, taxed at 20 percent, over shares with short-term
gains, which can be taxed at rates as high as 39.6 percent. When
selling a stock, managers of tax-managed funds first shed those
shares for which they paid the highest price. That minimizes gains
and therefore taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when investors in tax-managed funds eventually sell
their holdings, they must pay capital gains taxes on the price
appreciation in their shares. But postponing taxes, especially
until retirement, when many people find themselves in lower tax
brackets, is the holy grail of tax management. Until then, the
tax-managed fund helps them pay less year to year. And they can
avoid much income from dividends and short-term gains entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Tax-efficient managers also offset capital gains by selling
losers, in a practice known as harvesting losses, by banking them
against any gains taken within the next eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the tax-efficient category, most mutual fund managers
may pay little heed to tax consequences. And why should they?
Virtually all of the industry's performance benchmarks, upon which
managers' pay is based, are set on a pretax basis.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring tax consequences can have dramatic effects, even for
investors in lower tax brackets, according to KPMG. It calculated
the after-tax returns of two hypothetical portfolios. The first, a
tax-managed fund, earned no annual income or short-term gains and
had long-term capital gains distributions of 1 percent a year. The
second, a conventional fund, earned annual income and short-term
gains equal to 3 percent a year and had annual long-term capital
gains distributions of 4 percent a year. Over 10 years, $10,000
invested in the tax-managed account earning 10 percent a year would
grow to $22,628. The same $10,000 invested in the regular account,
earning the same 10 percent a year, would grow to $20,738 for an
investor in the top tax bracket and $21,426 for an investor in the
28 percent bracket, KPMG said. And state taxes can take an
additional bite.
</P>
<P>
   Many advisers, as well as do-it-yourself investors, call
tax-managed funds a marketing gimmick and worry that their
portfolio managers may give short shrift to good stock-picking in
their efforts to minimize taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But the managers bristle at that assessment. ``It's not like I'm
sitting here with blinders on,'' said Terry Banet, lead manager of
J.P. Morgan Tax Aware U.S. Equity and subadviser of the new
SunAmerica Tax Managed Equity fund.
</P>
<P>
   Though the tax-managed category is growing, it is still small.
Eaton Vance and Vanguard are the only companies that offer a
variety of tax-managed funds with stocks of differing levels of
market capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Lallos, an analyst at Morningstar, suggests that investors
look at a variety of funds, including some that are tax-managed and
some that are not. ``There are a lot of funds out there that are
pretty efficient even if they don't have `tax-managed' in their
name,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Portfolio turnover is often used as a rough estimate of a fund's
tax efficiency. But Morningstar publishes funds' after-tax returns
_ which are far more useful in assessing tax efficiency _ as well
as their potential capital gains exposures.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid duplication in their portfolios, investors should
understand how a particular fund achieves its tax efficiency. Some
funds, for example, are passively managed to a large degree. One of
them, Vanguard Tax-Managed Growth and Income, is similar to the
giant Vanguard 500 Index fund, which tracks the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index. The difference is that in the tax-managed fund,
Sauter and his colleagues deviate from their goal of tracking the
S&AMP;P as closely as possible to consider the tax consequences of any
purchase or sale.
</P>
<P>
   When Intel shares slid last summer after a disappointing
earnings announcement, the tax-managed portfolio sold some shares
at a substantial loss to harvest losses for the future, he said.
That was not done in the main Vanguard 500 Index fund, where ``100
percent of the focus is on tracking error,'' he said, referring to
the fact that index funds are concerned only with matching their
benchmarks as closely as possible.
</P>
<P>
   A more active route is pursued by Prudential Tax-Managed Equity,
which uses a quantitative approach. If the fund holds shares of a
bank stock that is falling, it might sell the shares and, with the
aid of quantitative models, find a similar bank stock with better
prospects, said James Scott, one of three managers of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll take the immediate loss and hope to run the other one
into a long-term gain,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   Another actively managed fund is J.P. Morgan Tax Aware U.S.
Equity. When considering a stock purchase, Ms. Banet, the lead
manager, asks whether the expected returns of a new stock will make
up for the tax cost of selling existing shares of a similar
company. If the tradeoff does not make sense, she considers selling
other stocks that she is holding at a loss. The strategy results in
a turnover of 32 percent, which is not particularly low, but that
is of little consequence because of the offsetting of gains with
losses.
</P>
<P>
   An unusual feature of the J.P. Morgan fund allows Ms. Banet to
pay investors who redeem shares totaling as little as $250,000 in
stock, rather than cash. By distributing stock, Ms. Banet has
avoided selling portfolio holdings with short-term gains _ a
strategy that would hurt the remaining shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid big redemptions, tax-managed funds try to attract
investors who plan to stay for a while. American Century will
charge investors in its new Tax-Managed Value fund a 2 percent
redemption fee for any withdrawals made in the first year. The fee
goes back into the fund, to help compensate shareholders for any
losses the fund would have to take from selling securities.

   For decades, investors have had difficulty tracking closed-end
funds. While they could easily follow the tick-by-tick prices of
such funds on various markets, they could readily determine the
value of a fund's holdings only once a week, in newspaper listings
that disclosed the funds' net asset values as of Friday's close.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Closed-End Fund Association, a trade group based in
Kansas City, Mo., is trying to address that issue by publishing the
daily net asset values of many closed-end funds on its World Wide
Web site, www.closed-endfunds.com.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 386 of the 500 or so United States closed-end funds
make their daily net asset values available through the site, which
uses data provided by CDA/Weisenberger, a research firm in
Rockville, Md. The remainder of the funds report their net asset
values weekly.

   Some Trimming at Invesco
</P>
<P>
   The Invesco Funds Group, based in Denver, is asking shareholders
to approve eight fund mergers and the closure of three other funds,
reducing the number of Invesco offerings by about 25 percent. The
vote is scheduled for May 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason is to simplify the product line and make it
easier for investors to choose,'' said Colleen Noth, a spokeswoman.
These eight funds would be merged with similar but larger funds:
International Growth, Small Company Value, Multi-Asset Allocation,
European Small Company, Asian Growth, Short-Term Bond, Intermediate
government Bond and Tax-Free Intermediate Bond. The three Invesco
funds that would be closed, Emerging Markets, Worldwide Capital
Goods and Environmental Services, have total assets of only $18
million and are in areas of the market that have not performed
well, she said; the company has no similar funds with which to
merge them.
</P>
<P>
   Invesco, a unit of Amvescap PLC of London, also plans to charge
a 2 percent redemption fee on assets pulled out of nine funds
within three months of purchase, beginning May 1. The move, which
is not subject to shareholder approval, is intended to shield
long-term investors from the costs created when market timers jump
in and out of funds.

THIRD-GENERATION GOLDWYN BEHIND THE CAMERA IN `A WALK ON THE
MOON' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Samuel Goldwyn co-produced the first feature film shot in
Hollywood, gave his initial ``G'' to ``M-G-M'' and is remembered as
one of the two or three most influential of all the legendary
producers of the movies' Golden Age.
</P>
<P>
   His son, Samuel Goldwyn Jr., inherited his father's studio and
his love of the movies, and adapted Goldwyn Sr.'s maverick style of
quality filmmaking to the modern era to become one of the top
independent producers of the '70s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   But Sam Jr.'s son, Tony, wanted no part of the family business.
He had to be forced to go to the movies, made few friends among his
father and grandfather's circle and was happy to be educated miles
from the movie colony.
</P>
<P>
   So this third-generation Goldwyn's move behind the camera to
both co-produce and direct a major film _ a film, ``A Walk On the
Moon,'' that is not at all bad _ seems something of an occasion:
the fulfillment of a great family destiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I still don't have much interest in producing,'' the
tall, handsome, thirtysomething actor-producer-director said
recently while in Seattle to promote the film. ``And I won't be
running any studios anytime soon. But I have fallen in love with
directing. I think I'm hooked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As for family destiny,'' he added, ``the truth is that my
father was not at all interested in my being in the movie business
in any capacity. He discouraged my brother and I every chance he
got. He knew better than anyone that `Goldwyn' would be a tough
name to live up to in Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, his initial calling was something that had never
much interested either of the two elder Goldwyns _ acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sent off to a boarding school in Colorado that happened
to have the world's greatest drama department. A teacher there _ a
brilliant teacher _ deeply influenced me, and gave me the acting
bug.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to Brandeis University, then studied at the London
Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. After several seasons at the
Williamstown Theater Festival, he made his New York debut in 1985,
and built a solid theatrical resume with stage appearances at Mark
Taper Forum, the Cherry Lane Theater and Second Stage.
</P>
<P>
   He ``stumbled'' into the movies when his audition beat out of a
host of competitors for a supporting role in 1990's ``Ghost.''
Through the rest of the decade, he kept busy with supporting parts
in a succession of theatrical, TV and cable movies _ among them
``Nixon,'' ``From the Earth to the Moon'' (as Neil Armstrong),
``The Pelican Brief'' and, most prominently, ``The Substance of
Fire.''
</P>
<P>
   He also built ``a pretty good life'' for himself. He married
production designer Jane Musky (``When Harry Met Sally''), moved to
Connecticut (``We're basically East Coast people'') and had two
children _ ``which have been the center of our lives. We've never
been terribly social, at least in a Hollywood sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``itch to direct'' came to him, he said, ``rather slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Since my background was in theater, I'd been spoiled by the
quality of directors I'd had. Some of the film directors were also
good _ in fact, Dan Sullivan (the former artistic director of
Seattle Repertory Theater), who directed `The Substance of Fire,'
was probably the best director I've worked with in my career.
</P>
<P>
   ``But many of the others _ particularly the younger ones _ were
directors who had trained in videos and television commercials.
Directors who were not actor-oriented _ and didn't have the
faintest idea how to work with actors. So I began to think, `I know
how to work with actors _ maybe I would try my hand at directing.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So I began to look around for a small project to do _ maybe a
short. Instead I came across the script of `A Walk On the Moon' _ a
beautiful piece of writing filled with tremendous wit, intelligent
dialogue and a truly unique voice. (It had) a freshness, an
emotional daring and an authenticity about it that I just fell in
love with.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the story of a family that comes apart because of an affair
and reforms itself during the turbulent summer of 1969, as the moon
walk captivates the nation and Woodstock is taking place just a few
miles from where the family is summering in the Catskills.
</P>
<P>
   He optioned the script, and took it to Dustin Hoffman's Punch
Productions, which immediately agreed to finance it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dustin became my mentor, my filmmaking father figure. I
learned so much from him, I can't tell you. His sense of commitment
to everything he does is just ... thrilling. His impact on the film
_ and on me personally _ is profound.''
</P>
<P>
   When they finally began production, he found ``the old summer
world of the Catskills no longer exists _ it died out in the '70s,
as most working class Jewish families assimilated into the culture.
All the old Catskills places were in ruins, so we had to go all the
way to Canada to find a suitable place to use as a set ...''
</P>
<P>
   He and Hoffman felt a ``great responsibility'' to be true to
this vanished world, to record it accurately and respectfully, and
not to ridicule it. ``Pamela (Gray, the screenwriter) knew this
world well, but neither Dustin or I had ever experienced it as
kids. So we spent a lot of time just talking with Catskills
veterans.''
</P>
<P>
   He also wanted to be true to the '60s, and not paint the era in
terms of the usual cliches or stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dustin wanted the movie to be a more positive view of the '60s
than we usually get _ the story of how many people opened up,
glimpsed new possibilities, became less structured, better human
beings.''
</P>
<P>
   They hired cinematographer Anthony Richmond, who had shot the
Beatles' ``Let It Be'' and classic concert films by The Who and the
Rolling Stones ... and filled the soundtrack with some of the
lesser-known songs of Bob Dylan, The Grateful Dead, Jefferson
Airplane, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Its A Beautiful Day and
others.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was always my favorite music, so it was vital to me that
we have songs that would subliminally speak to what's happening on
the screen ... I'm very proud of the fact that so many of the
artists _ including Bob Dylan _ liked our movie so much that they
gave us the songs at a bargain rate. Otherwise we never could have
afforded them on our budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldwyn says he has no acting job on the horizon and is
developing two new scripts _ ``Imagining Nathan,'' with
Oscar-winning screenwriter Bo Goldman, and ``Georgia Rule,'' with
Mark Andrus. Does this mean that he's giving up acting for the life
of a producer? Is the Goldwyn blood reasserting itself?
</P>
<P>
   He laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really. I still don't have that famous `producer's
instinct' that my grandfather had, and my father had. My brother
(John Goldwyn, a top production executive at Paramount) has it, for
sure. But directing _ that's a whole different instinct. That I do
have _ in fact, I think I was born to direct.''

FIRE SMOLDERING UNDER KREMLIN SCORCHES PROSECUTOR AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Remember Yuri Skuratov, Russia's chief prosecutor? He's
the man President Boris Yeltsin tried to squeeze out of office and
whose job was saved by the upper house of parliament last month in
a resurrection that was suddenly overshadowed by the broadcast of
an explicit tape of his romp with two prostitutes on a
government-run television station.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Yeltsin dismissed Skuratov again Friday _ at least
temporarily _ this time because of his connection to a criminal
case deemed incompatible with the dignity of his office.
</P>
<P>
   So at a time when political passions are already inflamed by the
Balkan conflict, Russia seems about to be rocked by another murky
scandal. And once again, the issue will have little to do with sex,
crime or corruption, and much to do with the only real topic in
Russian politics: the recurrent, deadly serious battle between
Yeltsin and his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   With the debate on Yeltsin's impeachment set to begin April 15
in the opposition-dominated lower house of parliament, the stakes
keep getting higher. The Russian constitution makes it very
difficult to remove a president from office, but even a vote to
begin impeachment would reverberate through this weakened political
system.
</P>
<P>
   Now, by ordering Skuratov's dismissal again (this time only for
as long as it takes to complete the investigation into a charge of
abuse of office), Yeltsin has set the stage for another showdown in
the Federation Council, the upper house of parliament made up of
regional governors and administrators who were once his loyal
allies.
</P>
<P>
   But those days are over. Russia's regional bosses have already
sensed the shift in power away from the Kremlin and seem to think
nothing of defying the president.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction in the lower house to the president's order to
dismiss Skuratov was predictably explosive. Viktor Ilyukhin, a top
Communist Party deputy, accused the Kremlin of trying to stage a
coup d'etat, and of taking measures to declare a state of emergency
in Moscow. Another opposition leader answered by accusing the
Communists of trying to spring back to power, as they did in August
1991. ``We will beat you,'' shouted Aleksei Mitrofanov, a leader of
the Liberal Democratic party, pounding his fists.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, there were conflicting versions of why Yeltsin
moved so suddenly and so swiftly to dismiss Skuratov. Yeltsin's
decree was issued shortly after 8 a.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
   According to one version, the decision was prompted by a
television interview with the 46-year-old prosecutor, broadcast on
Thursday night, in which he said he was ready to open a corruption
case against ``well-known'' figures in Russian politics who he said
had stashed illegal profits in Swiss bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gennadi Zyuganov, the Communist Party chief, who
has made Skuratov a crucial ally, the owners of 20 suspect bank
accounts include people in Yeltsin's inner circle, and the accounts
contain a total of about $40 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after he was restored to office last month, Skuratov began
the first public investigation to reach into the Kremlin itself.
Documents belonging to Pavel Borodin, the head of the presidential
administration's powerful property management office, were seized
as part of an inquiry into lucrative government contracts awarded
to a Swiss construction firm, Mabetex.
</P>
<P>
   Skuratov last week held lengthy meetings with Carla del Ponte,
Switzerland's formidable prosecutor general, who has her own
interests in tracking down any illegal funds from Russia that have
been funneled into Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
   But according to accounts that flitted across Russia's airwaves
and Web sites Friday, there was another reason for Skuratov's
dismissal, one having to do not with Swiss bank accounts but with
the sex video scandal.
</P>
<P>
   According to those accounts, Skuratov's relationship with the
two prostitutes was not a simple one-night stand, but rather a
lengthy affair involving trips to the Black Sea resort of Sochi,
all paid for by a businessman who, it is said, was under
investigation by the Moscow prosecutor's office and who used the
videotape as blackmail against the country's chief prosecutor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to a report issued Friday by the news agency Interfax,
a significant piece of evidence became available late Thursday,
when one of the two prostitutes in the video was interviewed by
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting versions are symptomatic of the most recent
phase of Russia's political wars, in which antagonists have reached
into their rich reserves of ``kompromat'' _ compromising material _
in attempts to tarnish one another.
</P>
<P>
   In a televised interview Friday, two of Yeltsin's top law
enforcement officials _ Vladimir Putin, head of the Federal
Security Service, and Sergei Stepashin, the interior minister _
said that Yeltsin's order to dismiss Skuratov was both justified
and constitutional. The investigation is being carried out by a
deputy Moscow prosecutor, they said, adding that Skuratov's
dismissal would not interfere with cases at the federal level.
</P>
<P>
   But after vociferous debate, the lower house of the parliament
on Friday passed a resolution challenging the constitutionality of
the president's order, and asking the upper house to review it as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Yeltsin succeeded Friday in winning the approval of
his fellow presidents in the Commonwealth of Independent States for
the dismissal of another troublesome figure, Boris Berezovsky, a
financier and political intriguer whose businesses have come under
investigation and who is said to have maintained close ties to the
Yeltsin family, in particular the president's daughter, Tatyana
Dyachenko.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky was not present at the commonwealth's summit meeting.
In fact, he was not even in Moscow. His plane, which left Paris on
Thursday, was denied permission to fly through Russian airspace and
changed course to Kiev, the Ukrainian capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can comment on events that don't contradict common sense,''
said Berezovsky in an interview with Interfax, as he sat fuming in
the Kiev airport, `'but I cannot comment on a lunatic asylum.''
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky, who is scheduled for questioning by the Russian
prosecutor's office, said that once he had missed the commonwealth
meeting, he was no longer in any hurry to return to Moscow. But he
denied reports that he would seek asylum in another country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to tell certain Russian politicians, `Do not even
hope''' for this, he told Interfax.

 &HT;    GROWING FEARS THAT KOSOVO CRISIS COULD SPARK CIVIL WAR IN
MONTENEGRO
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Montenegro, Yugoslavia Despite efforts of the
government here to calm public anxiety, people in this tiny,
Western-leaning republic next to Serbia are bracing for war.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-led NATO air campaign against Serbia has heightened
tensions and fueled talk of a coup d'etat in this neighboring
state, which exists in an uneasy federation with Serbia to make up
present-day Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Britain said it had evidence that Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic is plotting a coup in Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   A sudden government takeover or a protracted civil war between
pro- and anti-Serb factions in Montenegro would up the stakes in
NATO's air campaign against Yugoslavia and possibly intensify
pressure on the United States and its allies to commit
</P>
<P>
   ground troops to the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason to panic,'' Predrag Drecun, the government
minister for social welfare, told a news conference Friday in an
effort to allay fears.
</P>
<P>
   But government officials in Montenegro have said privately that
they suspect Belgrade could seek to take advantage of the NATO
attacks to seize control of Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Milosevic, the Serb leader who heads the federal
government, replaced his army chief in Montenegro with a close ally
to command the estimated 12,000 Yugoslav army troops stationed in
Montenegro. Second Army Cmdr. Gen. Radoslav Martinovic was recalled
to Belgrade and replaced by the nationalist Gen. Milorad Obradovic.
</P>
<P>
   The move, coupled with an increased presence of interior
ministry troops on the street in Podgorica loyal to the
anti-Milosevic government of Montenegro, has raised concerns and
speculation that a coup could be imminent, or that the opposing
troops could enter into a bloody struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here are afraid there will be a civil war,'' said
Nebojsa Vukcevic, manager of a rental car agency here in the
capital, Podgorica.
</P>
<P>
   For the West, Montenegro and its population of 680,000, has in
recent years represented an important toehold in the troubled
Balkans. President Milo Djukanovic, the liberal who heads the
ethnically-mixed republic, has put distance between himself and
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade and won Western support for democratic and economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Despite NATO attacks on federal Yugoslav military targets within
Montenegro, Djukanovic has declined to endorse Belgrade's
declaration of a state of war or exercise extraordinary control of
the media.
</P>
<P>
   His government also is struggling with the potentially
destabilizing influx of more than 20,000 refugees from the besieged
province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The uneasiness in this relatively quiet corner of the Balkans
has been reinforced in recent days by assessments from the United
States and its allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have evidence to show that (Milosevic) is preparing a coup
against Montenegro,'' senior British Defense Ministry official
Edgar Buckley said Friday in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are watching the situation very carefully. All our options
are open,'' he added in remarks before a daily news briefing on the
NATO air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin said Friday that U.S.
support for Djukanovic is ``strong and unwavering.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any attempt to overthrow the democratically-elected government
of Montenegro would only fuel wider instability and lead to deeper
isolation for Yugoslavia and escalate the conflict with NATO, `` he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro's main opposition party, the Socialist People's Party
(SNP), which is aligned with Milosevic, said Friday it was
committed to stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a state of war, any change in the authorities would
represent a revolution, a change brought about by violence and
civil strife. We want to avoid this,'' SNP vice-president Predrag
Bulatovic told Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   But on the street, few were convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sitting on the top of a volcano here,'' said a local
aid worker and pro-democracy advocate.

ECONOMIC VIEW: IS THE U.S. INCOME GAP REALLY A BIG PROBLEM?

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In economics, the facts alone don't usually tell the whole
story.
</P>
<P>
   Consider inequality, the trendy subject of dozens of books in
the last few years. The facts are uncontroversial: By any hard
measure _ wages, income, wealth _ the gap between rich and poor in
America has been widening for decades. And while there are
indications that the gap may have stopped growing in the mid-1990s,
the disparities between Americans of different means are wider
today than at any time since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a big problem, right? The conventional wisdom says
so.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, though, none of the authors who spend hundreds of pages
and thousands of statistics documenting the phenomenon devote even
a few paragraphs to rigorously demonstrating that greater income
disparities _ as opposed to, say, the persistence of an entrenched
underclass _ is a serious problem for the nation. They simply
assume that it is.
</P>
<P>
   So when two distinguished empirical economists take the trouble
to challenge what has become an article of faith, it's intriguing _
particularly because neither is a right-wing ideologue baldly
denying the facts, nor a hoary elitist insisting that inequality is
necessary for innovation, saving or support of ``high'' culture.
</P>
<P>
   The main question they must tackle is how to decide whether
rising inequality is good, bad or indifferent.
</P>
<P>
   One approach, taken by Martin Feldstein, president of the
National Bureau of Economic Research, is to ask whether the sources
of increasing inequality meet a widely accepted ethical criterion
first proposed by the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto. It is the
economic equivalent of the Hippocratic standard in medicine: Any
change is good if it makes someone better off without making anyone
else worse off.
</P>
<P>
   Feldstein examines some of the changes that have created an
explosion of riches at the very apex of America's income
distribution. The most important, economists agree, is the market's
increased tendency to heap most of its rewards on those with lots
of education and sophisticated skills.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, opportunities for entrepreneurs have burgeoned
wildly; as recently as 1980, 60 percent of the Forbes 400 had
inherited the bulk of their wealth; by 1997 the old money had
dropped to just 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the well-publicized phenomenon of the 70-hour work
week for investment bankers, lawyers, management consultants and
other top professionals, a contrast to the past when those who
worked the longest were those with the lowest wages. And, finally,
there's the extraordinary bull market in securities, mostly owned
by the haves.
</P>
<P>
   All these changes, Feldstein says, are in themselves positive,
and tend to benefit some individuals without making others any
worse off. By the Pareto criterion, that's a change for the better.
</P>
<P>
   Finis Welch, a labor economist at Texas A&AMP;M University who gave
this year's prestigious Ely Lecture at the American Economics
Association annual meeting, takes a different approach, focusing on
inequality's consequences rather than its causes. Welch argues that
rising inequality has had important positive effects along with at
least one negative.
</P>
<P>
   He points out that, while the market's uneven rewards for skills
have caused the wage gap between high-paid and low-paid individuals
in general to widen dramatically, they have also sharply narrowed
the far more disturbing wage gaps between blacks and whites and
between women and men.
</P>
<P>
   Under these circumstances, it is hard to believe that most
Americans would prefer the more homogenous income distribution of
the late 1940s, when racism and sexism severely limited
occupational choice and pay.
</P>
<P>
   Growing inequality could have devastating effects if it
convinced those at the bottom that efforts to move up are doomed to
failure. But largely the opposite has happened. Young Americans are
finishing high school and going on to college in record numbers, an
obvious plus.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one clear response to increased wage inequality that
Welch identifies is unambiguously troublesome. Low-skill,
low-education men react to their falling earnings potential by
giving up on work and relying instead on welfare and other social
programs for income, an option that did not exist before the
mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Policy-makers are more conscious of the pitfalls and are more
inclined than ever before to tie benefits to work. That, together
with the tightest labor market in memory and a recent surge in pay
among the less skilled, may be drawing some drop-outs back into the
work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was just wringing their hands'' about income
inequality, Welch said, ``but I just kept thinking that people have
more of a sense of control over their destinies than when I was a
kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Welch, who overcame a devastating accident that left him a
paraplegic at 18, seems in step with the mood of most ordinary
Americans, who seem to feel that, whatever has happened to the
income distribution, opportunities abound _ and not just for the
rich.

Editors: The following stories on the opening of the 1999 major
league baseball season will move Saturday, April 3: 
(jt)  c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BBO-SEASON (Undated) _ Even before the 1999 major-league
baseball season begins, it would seem that at least half of
baseball's teams are out of contention for no other reason than
budget constraints. A look at how they approach the game with that
in mind. By Murray Chass.
</P>
<P>
   BBO-SEASON-ONETIMERS (Undated) _ The major-league season starts
Sunday and, as is always the case, dozens of rookies will see
stardom looming before them. But for all their promise, at least a
few of them will become answers to a trivia question, appearing but
once. Then something _ injuries or fate or their own abilities _
will keep them from ever coming back. Countless ballplayers have
come up to the major leagues for the proverbial cup of coffee, but
only a few hundred have tasted the demitasse of a single game _
often at the end of blowouts or in the waning days of a losing
season. Most were standouts at every previous level of play. Some
bask in those memories. For others, their short careers still gnaw
at or embarrass them. By David Margolick.
</P>
<P>
   BBO-SEASON-GLOVES (Undated) _ Six million baseball gloves are
sold in the United States each year; maybe 2,000 end up on the
hands of major-leaguers. For most of these players, there is no
piece of equipment more important than their glove, which makes
sense: bats break and balls disappear into the stands, but a
player's glove is always waiting for him back on the bench. Last
season home-run balls got all the attention; it seems appropriate
now to give equal time to gloves. By Noah Liberman.

teams, in order of projected finish. By Murray Chass.

column on Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa as they prepare for their
encore to last season's magic. With graphic and photo. By Dave
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   BBA-SEASON-JETER (Undated) _ Ask around Kalamazoo, Mich., and
everybody seems to have only good things to say about Derek Jeter
and his family. Derek was the type of kid, Evelyn Lal said, ``that
you wanted your kid to be friends with.'' Shanti Lal, her son,
befriended Derek in the fourth grade, in Mrs. Garzelloni's class at
St. Augustine Cathedral School in Kalamazoo. ``Derek was one of
those kids you just never forget, and I would say that even if he
wasn't playing baseball,'' said Shirley Garzelloni, who retired
last year. Buster Olney visits the hometown of Derek Jeter, the
Yankees' shortstop and rising superstar.
</P>
<P>
   BBN-SEASON-PIAZZA (Port St. Lucie, Fla.) _ As he prepares to
enter his first full season as the centerpiece of a rebuilt New
York Mets offense, and claim his place on the most demanding of
sports stages, Mike Piazza remains an enigmatic superstar. By Jason
Diamos.
</P>
<P>
   BBO-SEASON-PREDICTIONS (Undated) _ New York Times sportswriters
Murray Chass, Jack Curry, Buster Olney and Jason Diamos offer their
predictions for the 1999 season, including their projected World
Series champions.

RETURNS OF VALUE MANAGERS HAVE FADED IN GROWTH FUNDS' SHADOW

<TEXT>
<P>
   Think value investors have it tough these days? Just ask William
Nasgovitz, portfolio manager of the Heartland Value fund, whose own
mother recently tried to pull her money out of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom wanted to buy Walgreen at 50 times earnings and sell
out of the value fund after making six times her money,'' Nasgovitz
said. ``It's a great company, but it isn't worth 50 times
earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   He eventually persuaded his mother to stay put. Recently,
however, his son Will admitted to buying an index fund. ``Another
little dagger,'' Nasgovitz said.
</P>
<P>
   And there are many more. ``Clients, consultants and advisers are
all tired of talking value,'' he said. ``They want action.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Action'' in this case really means one thing: big growth
companies and the funds that invest in them.
</P>
<P>
   Value managers like Nasgovitz have long shunned what they view
as overvalued growth stocks like Pfizer or Wal-Mart, trading at 40
times earnings or more. Instead, they favor stocks with lower
price-to-earnings or other valuation ratios.
</P>
<P>
   But that has lately brought grief for their shareholders, as
stocks relatively cheap by traditional measures continue to be
clobbered by the big growth companies that have paced the enormous
run-up in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, according to Morningstar Inc., large-cap growth funds
beat large-cap value funds by an average of nearly 25 percentage
points over the last 12 months, the widest margin this generation.
The trend held in the first quarter of 1999, with large-cap growth
funds turning in an average return of 6.9 percent, versus 0.9
percent for comparable value funds. Mid-caps and small caps, which
have trailed the large caps over all, have shown similar
disjunction, with growth funds wildly outperforming their value
siblings.
</P>
<P>
   As for Nasgovitz's small-cap value fund, it lost 8.3 percent in
the last quarter, slightly less than the average for its peer
group.
</P>
<P>
   The desperate straits of value managers have begun to alter the
investing landscape. While investors in the funds are the most
obvious sufferers, entire fund organizations are being disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts are questioning the accepted wisdom that investors
should hew closely to a specific investment style. And the plight
of the value manager is not helped by the fact that no one seems
sure why value stocks have underperformed so much in the last four
years.
</P>
<P>
   After being stalwart in their loyalty, longtime value fund
shareholders have begun to bolt: So far in 1999, three-quarters of
the funds with the largest investor withdrawals have been value
funds, according to AMG Data Services, a company in Arcata, Calif.,
that tracks mutual fund sales. Investors have pulled $10.3 billion
from those 15 funds this year, with the biggest net withdrawal _
$1.2 billion _ coming from the once-storied Vanguard Windsor.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, so far this year, a total of $9.6 billion has poured
into the two most popular growth funds, the Janus 20 and the
Vanguard Growth Index, together with the Vanguard 500 Index.
</P>
<P>
   The role of value funds _ especially those of the large-cap
variety _ as a mainstay of the individual investor's portfolio has
been diminishing. Just over a year ago, investors had $2 invested
in large-cap value funds for every $1 in large growth funds,
according to Financial Research Corp., a data gatherer in Boston.
But that ratio has narrowed, to $2 in the value funds for every
$1.40 in the growth funds _ a result of market gains, sales of
value fund shares and purchases of growth fund shares.
</P>
<P>
   And the trend is accelerating. About 98 percent of new money
flowing into equity mutual funds this year has gone to growth
funds, according to J.P. Morgan Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Fund companies with a value bent are feeling investors' pain.
Shares of Franklin Resources, a big value and international mutual
fund manager, dropped 47.1 percent in the last year as some of its
best-known funds, including the Mutual Series funds, lagged
substantially behind the market. (By comparison, shares of Kansas
City Southern Industries, which owns the red-hot Janus funds, have
jumped almost one-third over the last 12 months to near an all-time
high, as its assets have soared 60 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   But as Nasgovitz can attest, it is the value managers themselves
who have borne the brunt of the storm.
</P>
<P>
   Poor performance recently led the Vanguard Group's chief
executive, John J. Brennan, to hire stock-pickers from Sanford C.
Bernstein to take over part of the Windsor fund portfolio run by
the value manager Charles Freeman, a longtime protege of the
legendary Windsor manager John Neff.
</P>
<P>
   And last month Jean-Marie Eveillard, the value manager at
Societe Generale, saw the demise of a deal to sell the company's
asset management unit to Liberty Financial after $2 billion in
losses and investor withdrawals from his company's mutual funds.
``It has been four years of basically crossing the desert,'' said
Eveillard, who owns 20 percent of the money management unit. ``If
one was not in big growth stocks, one was pretty much left with the
crumbs.''

WESTERN RESOURCES SUBSIDIARY'S SEC REVIEW SENDS STOCK DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Western Resources Inc. said Thursday that its
Protection One subsidiary would have to restate earnings for the
past two years after a review by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement pushed Western's stock price lower and renewed
questions about the fate of its proposed purchase of Kansas City
Power &AMP; Light Co.
</P>
<P>
   Western's stock Thursday fell 1 3/16, to 25 1/2. The merger
agreement permits either company to stop the deal shortly before it
becomes official if Western's stock price is at or below 29 25/32.
</P>
<P>
   Western said it expected the stock price to go up as the merger
nears completion and it gets the necessary regulatory approvals.
KCP&AMP;L said it was too early to discuss how it would respond if
Western's stock doesn't rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't speculate what would be done, but everyone here is
monitoring that,'' said Pam Levetzow, a KCP&AMP;L spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The questions followed Thursday's announcement that Protection
One, a burglar alarm company that is 85 percent owned by Western,
was ordered by the SEC to restate its earnings. The problem centers
on how Protection One accounted for the costs of replacing the
monitored-security service's yard signs.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC order adds $6.9 million to Protection One's net income
in 1997 but decreases net income by $13 million for 1998.
Protection One's stock Thursday lost 2 1/4, to 4.
</P>
<P>
   The restatement will ripple to Western Resources' shareholders,
as 1998 earnings will decline from a previously announced 84 cents
per share to 67 cents per share. Western received a 15-day
extension from the SEC to file its 1998 financial statements.
</P>
<P>
   More troubling to some analysts was the SEC's decision to
further review Protection One's accounting of customer acquisition
costs over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC questioned whether the method was appropriate.
Protection One is in the process of buying Lifeline Systems Inc., a
health monitoring company.
</P>
<P>
   Michel' Philipp, a spokeswoman for Topeka-based Western
Resources, said it was an accepted industry practice to spread
customer acquisition costs over more than one year. Protection One
is working with the SEC to resolve the matter. A resolution could
be reached by mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the scrutiny of Protection One, Western Resources hasn't
soured on the company. It is a high-growth company and continues to
fit in Western's plans, Philipp said.
</P>
<P>
   Western recently has been more critical of regulatory efforts to
increase utility rate reductions, which the company has said hurts
its financial operations.
</P>
<P>
   David Wittig, Western Resource's chairman and chief executive
officer, on Thursday again raised the issue in a letter to
shareholders. He said the stock's recent performance, which is down
from a 52-week high of 43, was due to utility rate decreases that
cost the company $75 million.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, more cuts suggested by the staff of the
Kansas Corporation Commission would scuttle the merger with KCP&AMP;L.
The letter also urged shareholders to participate more in the
company's Dividend Reinvestment Plan, an effort to help maintain
the expected dividend of $2.14 per share in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Western's stock price, which is at its lowest level
in the past year, stirred more speculation about the KCP&AMP;L
purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Fischer, an analyst with A.G. Edwards, said that anytime
Western's stock declined, the question was raised. KCP&AMP;L has told
analysts it will look closely at the numbers before completing the
merger.
</P>
<P>
   The merger agreement allows either Western or KCP&AMP;L to terminate
the deal a few days before it would become official if the stock
price is at 29 25/32 or below. Since regulatory hearings haven't
been conducted yet, the deal might not be wrapped up until later
this year or in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   As crafted, the merger agreement benefits KCP&AMP;L shareholders
more as Western's stock rises. For each share of KCP&AMP;L stock, which
closed Thursday at 24 3/8, shareholders would receive one share of
Westar Energy. Westar Energy would be a separately traded entity
that would include the KGE, KPL and KCP&AMP;L electric utilities.
Nearly a year ago it was estimated that a share of Westar would be
worth $10 to $12.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, KCP&AMP;L shareholders would receive Western stock.
Originally that stock was estimated to be worth about $23.50 a
share, but the value varies depending on the price of Western's
stock. At Thursday's price, KCP&AMP;L shareholders would receive
Western stock worth $18.41 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Philipp, the Western spokeswoman, said the company's stock would
rise once regulators approve the buyout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The merger goes on,'' she said.

 UNDATED: the crumbs.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For all the disruption, there is no consensus on what has caused
the gap between value and growth to be so wide, or on when it will
close.
</P>
<P>
   Some managers think that with the advent of a new,
technology-driven economy _ where economic cycles are far longer
than they have been in the past _ it could be many years before
value stocks return to favor for an appreciable period.
</P>
<P>
   But more managers cite a combination of temporary issues. Among
the big factors over the last two years, many say, were the
economic crises in Asia, Russia and Brazil that moved money
managers to buy the big technology and stable multinational
consumer-goods companies that proved, quarter after quarter, that
they could sustain profit growth even in rocky times.
</P>
<P>
   Growth stocks were driven up further, they say, by what is
sometimes called ``closet indexing'' _ the purchase of the
largest-capitalization stocks in, say, the S&AMP;P by active fund
managers. Some managers moved into these big growth stocks simply
because they grew tired of missing out on the market's momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The rush to Internet stocks also played a role in helping growth
funds, some said, while day traders _ the ultimate momentum players
_ became market movers in their own right.
</P>
<P>
   Low interest rates, meanwhile, allowed bullish analysts and
investors to justify ever-increasing P/E multiples. Plummeting
commodity prices, driven lower by waning Asian demand, socked
energy and natural resources companies, core holdings of many value
portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding commodity companies was the biggest reason that the $31
billion Vanguard Windsor II fund beat so many other value funds
last year, said the fund's manager, James Barrow. ``The metals and
heavy chemicals and things like that, those stocks were just
terrible last year,'' said Barrow, whose fund rose 16.4 percent in
1998 but still trailed the average large-cap growth fund by nearly
20 percentage points. Last quarter, it rose 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Managers have been feeling increased pressure from fund
companies and 401(k) clients to stick with an investing style, be
it large-cap growth, small-cap value or whatever, no matter what
the market might do. Now, some value managers have rethought the
way they appraise the value-growth distinction.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some have long been flexible. ``It boxes you in,''
said Charles Royce, who manages $2.3 billion in value-oriented
portfolios at Royce Funds, referring to the tendency to pigeonhole
managers into narrow classifications. ``It's defining what kind of
stocks you buy, as opposed to what you think is the most
interesting opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We buy growth stocks when they're depressed, but we're a value
manager,'' Royce added. ``If the style police were looking over our
shoulder, they would probably raise that issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors are less likely to do so: His funds have generally
lost less money in the last year than the average small-cap value
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Barrow, the Vanguard manager, does not criticize value managers
who are riding high on some high-valuation stocks, like William
Miller of Legg Mason Value Trust, a large-cap fund that rose 49.9
percent in the last year on the back of high P/E stocks like Dell
Computer and America Online. ``I'd rather have his numbers, and try
to explain away his idea of value, than have mine,'' Barrow said.
</P>
<P>
   Few people, of course, predict the death of value equities,
which have outperformed growth stocks for long periods in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy J. Siegel, a professor of finance at the Wharton School
of the University of Pennsylvania, has noted that from 1962 to
1989, stocks with the lowest P/E ratios performed far better as a
group than stocks with the highest. And studies by Eugene Fama, a
University of Chicago finance professor, have shown that over long
periods, stocks with lower price-to-book ratios outperform those
with higher ratios.
</P>
<P>
   But this does not mean that value investors will feel better
anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   The divergence between growth and value could continue, said
George Sauter, manager of the $78 billion Vanguard 500 Index fund.
``Just because valuations would point more to value stocks and
small-cap stocks doesn't necessarily mean performance has to shift
there,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Sauter predicted that value stocks would eventually make a
comeback but warned that investors should not base their decisions
on when that will happen. Stock-picking ``is child's play next to
trying to call value and growth cycles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Value fund investors may have to swallow one last bitter pill
anyway. While many investors think that the relatively low
price-earnings and price-book ratios of value stocks provide a
cushion during market corrections, that has not been true lately.
Large-cap value and growth stocks fell about the same amount during
the October 1997 selloff, while value stocks actually declined
slightly more than growth stocks during the correction last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Few value managers dare to predict when their turnaround might
come, but they say that higher inflation or a strengthening economy
would be strong catalysts. Some of them say, optimistically
perhaps, that the recent 37 percent jump in oil-service stocks
could be a harbinger. And others say growth stocks could
underperform value stocks if the Internet bubble popped or if
technology companies' growth abated after worries over the Year
2000 computer bug passed.
</P>
<P>
   A turn could come soon, Douglas Cliggott, U.S. equity strategist
at J.P. Morgan, has argued. His research indicates that the last
time stocks had such high valuations _ measured by comparing bond
yields with the average P/E ratio of the S&AMP;P 500 _ was about seven
years ago, when value stocks began a two-year period of sharp
outperformance over growth stocks. Moreover, he thinks value stocks
will be spurred by an upturn in global economic growth in the
coming year.

UNDATED: coming year.  &HT;    And Eveillard of Societe Generale said things were so out of
whack that companies might take matters into their own hands. He
predicted that a wave of corporate arbitrage _ in which large
growth companies buy smaller value companies by trading their own
richly valued stock for the lower-valued shares _ might soon wash
through the markets. The big companies could add to their per-share
earnings even while paying huge premiums.
 &HT;    ``As always, when a strong trend has been in place for a few
years, there is no lack of people who rationalize why what has been
true will continue to be true _ in other words, that value, and
particularly small value, will never come back,'' Eveillard said.

 &HT;    Trying to Make Hay Until the Sun Shines Again
 &HT;    By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.
 &HT;    c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
<TEXT>

   They were famous. They were feared. They were profiled in glossy
magazines. Now many managers of value funds are bleeding assets as
the funds, as a group, lag behind broad benchmarks like the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index. How are some of these managers
coping?
</P>
<P>
   At the Short Hills, N.J., offices of Franklin Mutual Advisers,
the onetime proteges of renowned value investor Michael Price,
continue to focus on out-of-favor stocks. They favor the advice of
Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd in their 1934 value investor's
bible, ``Security Analysis'': Buy $1 worth of assets for 50 cents.
</P>
<P>
   That deep-value style was trumped last year by growth investing.
Relatively speaking, performance hasn't been bad: While the
flagship Mutual Shares fund lost 2.9 percent over the past 12
months, it beat the average mid-cap value fund by 6.2 percent, even
as its largest holding, the Sunbeam Corporation, fell 87.4 percent.
And the fund, with about $8 billion in assets, was up 4.9 percent
in the first quarter. The family's other big funds _ Mutual Beacon,
Mutual Qualified and Mutual Discovery _ reported similar returns.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in January and February, investors pulled $2.5 billion
from the four funds, according to AMG Data Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``As surely as growth in certain periods will be the rage and
will attract the money and investment for that period, it will
ultimately end,'' said Larry Sondike, a co-manager of the Shares
and Beacon funds.
</P>
<P>
   Among his current holdings, J.C. Penney, which slid from $77
last June to $40.4375 on Thursday, reminds him of Sears, Roebuck, a
stock that the Mutual Series funds bought in the early 1990's and
that tripled in value as the retailer spun off Dean Witter and
Allstate.
</P>
<P>
   Penney's Eckerd drugstore unit and an insurance subsidiary are
worth $30 a share combined, Sondike said. The company has over $6
billion in debt, but it also has a department store and catalog
business with almost $4 a share in operating income last year.
</P>
<P>
   To Martin Whitman, the market has rarely carried so much danger
_ or opportunity. The manager made his name buying distressed
companies; lately, he has bet big on Japan and on United States
semiconductor equipment makers. In the first quarter, investors
pulled $161.5 million out of his $1.3 billion flagship, the Third
Avenue Value fund, which lost 8.2 percent in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The recent market run-up is ``dangerous'' and ``scary,'' he
said, reminiscent of the narrow market dominated by the Nifty 50 in
the days before the 1973-74 selloff.
</P>
<P>
   One of his favorite stocks now is Tejon Ranch, a land
development and agribusiness concern. Its shares nearly tripled
after he bought a large stake in 1997 but have since fallen back to
$16.5625, a few dollars more than what he paid.
</P>
<P>
   William Nasgovitz, manager of Heartland Value, says he has seen
bad situations before. After the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990,
the fund dropped 30 percent in a few months _ twice as much as the
S&AMP;P. But over the next three years, the fund returned a cumulative
157 percent; the index rose 59 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That is little solace now, as he watches investors withdraw
money from his fund _ including $245 million in the last three
months. ``The client pressure is just intense,'' he said. ``People
are caving in.''
</P>
<P>
   Acquirers have noticed the bargains. Ten companies in the fund's
portfolio of more than 300 stocks have been taken over this year.
``If that continues, we won't have any stocks left by
Thanksgiving,'' Nasgovitz said.
</P>
<P>
   One current holding is Gibson Greetings, the Cincinnati greeting
card company, which has drifted from almost $30 a share last year
to $7 and now trades for less than tangible book value. ``This
stock has had its own bear market,'' he said.

A ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR THESE ECONOMIC HEROES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ How did America get to 10,000 on the Dow Jones
industrial average and within 11 months of the longest economic
expansion in U.S. history?
</P>
<P>
   Who are the heroes of this saga? Who should get credit for
America's rise from the depths of despair two decades ago to the
heights of its greatest prosperity ever? It's hard to believe, but
as the 1980s dawned, the stock market was a disaster and so was the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Japan was booming, and it had become fashionable to hold it up
as an example of the new economic paradigm America had to embrace
if it hoped to ever regain its greatness. The received wisdom among
liberal academics and politicos was that future prosperity was
possible only with a partnership of government and private
enterprise. The concept turned on the notion that government should
be the steward of an industrial policy ensuring that winners got
first dibs on increasingly scarce capital.
</P>
<P>
   Miraculously, America took the opposite path. The result was an
emphasis on deregulation, lower tax rates for income and capital
gains, and diminishing central bank intrusion in the financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, any hall of fame honoring those who made the most
critical contributions to the current prosperity should start with
a Democrat, not a Republican. President Jimmy Carter was, in
retrospect, the first key player. He got the ball rolling toward
deregulation. Most importantly, he took the first steps to free the
energy market from misguided regulatory constraints that caused
crisis-inducing supply shortages. Carter also created another hero
of the epoch when he appointed Paul Volcker chairman of the Federal
Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Volcker was a pivotal factor, because he broke the back of
inflation with his decree that the financial marketplace be allowed
to determine interest rates. Meantime, the Fed would mind monetary
policy with an eye toward noninflationary money-supply growth.
</P>
<P>
   An unsung hero was Rep. Bill Steiger, a Wisconsin Republican
whose late-1970s crusade to cut the capital gains tax rate resulted
in its reduction by nearly half.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Jarvis, a California tax rebel, also deserves
considerable credit for pushing his property tax relief initiative
over the top in his home state. In the process, he ignited a tax
revolt that spread eastward, state by state, until it hit the
nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   The tax revolt brought with it a former governor of California,
Ronald Reagan, who arrived in Washington and became the first
president since John F. Kennedy to champion significant tax relief
for working Americans. The Reaganomics regime saw the marginal
income tax rate decline from 70 percent for the highest earners to
28 percent for most average taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Another hero has been Alan Greenspan, who succeeded Volcker and
has fought inflation as tenaciously as his predecessor. Greenspan's
regime built on Volcker's accomplishments and gave the economy
sustained price stability for the first time in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   The debt America owes these heroes for its continuing good
fortune can't be overstated. While the rest of the world is beset
by economic malaise and predicaments of varying degrees, America
remains not only an oasis of prosperity but also the world's only
remaining engine of growth.

<TEXT>
<P>
   John M. Sunderland, the elfin-faced chief executive of Cadbury
Schweppes, has always been afraid of heights and for years resisted
flying. Yet there he was last year in Interlaken, Switzerland,
donning para-gliding gear and leaping from an Alpine crag in full
view of a gaggle of underlings.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose, he said, was to help underscore the ``managing for
value'' strategy that he believes will transform Cadbury Schweppes
from a sleepy, opportunity-missing, ultra-British conglomerate into
a sleek, value-driven global powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to prove that you can do anything if you set your
mind to it,'' said Sunderland, 54. Nothing interfered with his
flight, he said, and he even managed a dignified landing _ though
asked later whether he had tried paragliding again, he replied,
emphatically, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the gathered executives seem to have gotten the message.
Profits at the Cadbury Schweppes candy-and-soft-drink empire rose 6
percent last year, and the share price skyrocketed as well. The
company has started to get the attention of Wall Street, which had
dismissed it as a weak, third-tier player that relied too heavily
on bottling agreements with rivals like Coca-Cola and and Pepsico.
</P>
<P>
   Sipping every so often from a Diet Dr Pepper in a recent
interview in New York, Sunderland held forth on the importance of
setting a good example _ and on following the lead of one of his
idols, Margaret Thatcher, who fanned the flames of privatization in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``She demonstrated that change _ dramatic change for the benefit
of not just business, but society as a whole _ could be done if you
were committed to it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Mrs. Thatcher, he likes to shake things up in the name of
efficiency. For nearly two years he has been a Thatcher clone in
pinstripes, spreading across the company a message that exhorts
managers to be more accountable, adaptable and aggressive. And he
emphasizes increasing shareholder value (while making sure managers
are heavily invested in Cadbury shares, too).
</P>
<P>
   While such precepts may seem old hat to American executives,
particularly those at Coca-Cola (a company Sunderland knows well
and admires, thanks to a former bottling joint venture), they are
innovations at Cadbury. The company makes such quintessentially
British sweets as licorice allsorts, as well as Cadbury chocolates
and Dr Pepper, 7-Up and Schweppes soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Under Sir Dominic Cadbury, its chairman, Cadbury Schweppes spent
the first half of the '90s expanding beyond Britain, including its
purchase of the Dr Pepper/Seven Up Co., based in Plano, Texas, in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Sunderland is moving to solidify that expansion. First came a
joint venture in early 1998 that formed a bottling company
dedicated to Cadbury brands. Then Cadbury negotiated bottling
agreements with Coke and Pepsico that seemed to guarantee that
brands like Dr Pepper and 7-Up would be secure for several years.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Cadbury announced it was selling most of the
international rights to its brands, ranging from Dr Pepper to
Schweppes itself, to Coca-Cola. While the deal faces regulatory
hurdles and will likely take several more months to be completed,
it is worth $1.85 billion to Cadbury.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is still a somewhat neglected stock,'' said Caroline
Levy, an analyst who follows the beverage industry for Schroder &AMP;
Company. ``What they achieved last year took the market by
surprise.'' After rising 67 percent in 1998, the stock is down 11.6
percent so far this year, but Ms. Levy thinks it still shows a lot
of promise.
</P>
<P>
   Sunderland denied speculation that the Coca-Cola deal was but
the first step in his company's exit from beverages. After all, he
said, Cadbury has a 15 percent share of the American market. ``Why
on earth would we want to relinquish a position like that?'' he
asked. Still, many analysts expect the company to invest far more
heavily in its candy business than in soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Sunderland, who says he has 80 percent of his own net worth tied
up in Cadbury stock, grew up in Yorkshire and graduated from the
University of St. Andrews in Edinburgh with a degree in social
studies. He joined Cadbury's marketing department in 1968. Two
career high points, he said, were a stint in Ireland (he wears a
silver signet ring featuring Dublin's city crest) and his
orchestration of a merger of two English confectionery brands,
Trebor and Bassett. ``The satisfaction of creating something was
just exhilarating,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his spare time, Sunderland, who lives with his wife, Jeannie,
outside London, likes to hunt partridge, grouse and quail. He is
often accompanied by one of his three sons, whose ages range from
20 to 29. With his children leaning toward professions far
different from his own, he has started referring to them as
``altruists;'' his daughter is a teacher, and one son is in
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   As for the kinds of acquisitions Cadbury might make once the
deal with Coca-Cola becomes final, Sunderland offers few hints.
Consolidating the independent bottlers in the United States is one
priority, but he says he sees the fragmented global candy business
as a bigger gold mine. ``I'm a great believer in serendipity,'' he
said. ``It got me where I am today.''

AL GORE'S PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDACY HAS CREATED CONCERNS AMONG
DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The good news for Vice President Al Gore is that
after six years of laboring in Bill Clinton's shadow, he is
beginning to step out on his own.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the bad news, too.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore runs for president and begins to color in his own
personality, the early results have not been good. From boasting
about ``creating the Internet,'' to recalling how he used to
``clean out hog waste with a shovel and a hose,'' he has run into
ridicule lately as he's tried to define who he is.
</P>
<P>
   On top of all that, early polls continue to show him lagging
behind both front-runners in the Republican presidential race,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush and former Red Cross chief Elizabeth
Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Are Democrats worried?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little bit of a growing feeling of a little sense of
urgency,'' said Steve Jarding, national political director for Sen.
Robert Kerrey, a Nebraska Democrat who once considered challenging
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Al Gore is going to be the nominee of our party, he needs
to step out of that shadow _ of Clinton _ pretty quickly. The
problem is not the poll numbers. The problem is what underlies
those polls. Is this an individual who has the capacity to rally
the American public? It really is the $64,000 question.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats argue that the vice president's recent missteps will
be forgotten soon enough and are not the kind of pivotal concerns
that turn an election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is the best candidate for president that the
Democratic Party could ever find,'' said Joan Menard, party
chairwoman in Massachusetts and president of the State Democratic
Chairs Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every front-runner gets dissected and attacked, and better
that it happens a year out than during the primary season,'' said
Democratic pollster Mark Mellman, who has worked for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the first primary votes won't be cast until next year
and the presidential election is 19 months away. But Gore's biggest
challenge will be to energize Democrats who may feel somewhat spent
after manning the barricades so long for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``What effect is the impeachment mess going to have on Gore and
whether Gore really can connect with the electorate like Bill
Clinton did are all questions Gore is going to have to answer,''
said James Slattery, a former Democratic congressman from Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has to master the tricky ballet of distancing himself from
the president and becoming more his own person, while hoping to
inherit a strong economy and a stable foreign situation. In a
recent speech to the American Legion, he mentioned Clinton only
once, a passing reference to his support for veterans' benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But some Republicans believe that somebody, if not the president
himself _ whose post-impeachment public approval remains high _ is
eventually going to bear the cost of the Clinton scandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore may be another in long line of Clinton associates who
pays the price for Bill Clinton's actions,'' said David Israelite,
political director for the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's strong backing and fund-raising potential are just two
of the advantages Gore will have in the Democratic primaries. He
has racked up early establishment support, with endorsements from
House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri and Senate
Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Jarding said some Democratic activists believe that the best
thing that could happen to Gore is for him to face an aggressive
primary fight. He said Gore is an experienced politician with a
talented staff, but ``he needs to hone his own operation, his own
ideas, his own campaign. He's never done it on his own. That's what
has people a little bit on edge.''
</P>
<P>
   The only Democrat left to challenge Gore is former Sen. Bill
Bradley, who derides the vice president as a cautious pillar of the
old-line Washington establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bradley spent 18 years in the Senate, he portrays
himself as a Democratic outsider from a small town in Missouri _
Crystal City _ with ``a life before I got into politics.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear whether voters believe that ``a life'' as an NBA
star makes him more of a regular guy than Gore, who grew up the son
of a senator, lived in a Washington hotel and attended Ivy League
schools. Bradley went to Princeton and was a Rhodes scholar.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bradley's criticism that prompted Gore to wax nostalgic
about how as a youth, his father taught him to ``clear land with a
double-bladed ax...plow a steep hillside with a team of
mules...take up hay all day long in the hot sun...'' He then asked
whether ``Senator Bradley has had any of those experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   But his recollections only earned him attention like the
American Gothic cartoon parody on the front page of the Des Moines
Register.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans made great sport of Gore's gaffes. Of his claim to
cleaning up after hogs on his family's Tennessee farm, Republican
Party Chairman Jim Nicholson said, ``Mr. Vice President, with all
due respect, you're shoveling a lot more of it right now than you
ever did back then.''
</P>
<P>
   This rocky patch has created a degree of uneasiness, especially
when combined with the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Dole lead him in most surveys, even in California, even
among Hispanics, important factors for any Democratic victory in
2000. Of those Americans who count themselves as Clinton
supporters, a Pew Research Center poll noted, only a third said
there was a good chance they'd vote for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But for every poll that gives Republicans hope, history comforts
the Democrats. Gary Hart was ahead of President Bush roughly at
this stage 12 years ago. And Michael Dukakis, who won the
Democratic nomination the following year, led Bush by a healthy
margin, only to lose eventually.
</P>
<P>
   Mellman, the Democratic pollster, described the high approval
ratings of President Bush's son, George W. Bush, and Dole, wife of
1996 GOP presidential nominee Bob Dole, as ``idealized'' because
most of the people in those surveys had little or no idea about
what those two candidates stood for.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Gore's problem is his image. There have always been two
Gores, the public one, whose stiff image, even with his
self-deprecating jokes, often fails to inspire. Many say the
private Gore can be playful, with a biting sense of humor, or
plain-spoken with a take-no-prisoners style that the public rarely
sees.
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, former Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos
describes a witty Gore who ribbed Clinton regularly. And in an
account of the early Clinton presidency by Bob Woodward, Gore,
frustrated with the president's waffling in budget talks, turned to
him and snapped: ``You can get with the ... program!''
</P>
<P>
   Andrei Cherny, the vice president's former senior speech writer,
said it's important that Gore reveal more of himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he needs to do is go out there and tell his story,'' said
Cherny, who edits Blueprint, a centrist Democratic policy magazine.
``And that means not just details of his life, but what he stands
for, what he won't stand for, what are the public values and
principles that he holds. When the American people do get a full
sense of that, they'll respond favorably.''

AVERAGE PRICE OF GAS IN AREA UP ALMOST 34 PERCENT IN LESS THAN A
MONTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ In less than a month, the average price of
gasoline in the Kansas City area has soared almost 34 percent,
including a 10 percent jump since last weekend. That's the biggest
jump since 1990, after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   ``We enjoyed unreasonably low prices in 1998; we probably won't
see that this year,'' said Mike Right of AAA Automobile Club of
Missouri, which tracks price trends.
</P>
<P>
   Right said a survey last Friday found that the area average
price for a gallon of self-serve regular unleaded was 96 1/2 cents.
When today's survey is compiled, Right said, the average price is
expected to jump to $1.06 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as March 5, the average price at area pumps was just
under 80 cents a gallon. The last time prices were in the $1-plus
range was last July.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Shanahan of the American Petroleum Institute in Washington
said several recent events had driven up prices at the pump,
especially in California, where some prices are around $2 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
reached an agreement to limit production. Although such efforts
have faltered in the past because some members cheated and pumped
more oil than they pledged, Right said those renegades might adhere
this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of some of the severe economic problems that some of
the members are having because of low prices, I believe more of
them will stick with the program,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor driving up prices is a decrease in world
supplies, a naturally occurring cyclical factor, Shanahan said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a fire at a West Coast refinery and mechanical problems at
another have slowed production.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may think that because those refineries aren't in this
area that it won't affect their prices, but that's not true,''
Shanahan said. ``It affects prices everywhere.

JOBS REPORT SPURS BOND RALLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A smaller-than-expected increase in nonfarm payroll
jobs last month, in part a result of a decline in manufacturing
jobs, set off the bond market's best rally in four weeks Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a special holiday-shortened session, held to allow trading
after the 8:30 a.m. release of the March employment data, the price
of the 30-year Treasury bond jumped 1 2/32, to 95 1/32. The bond's
yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell
to 5.59 percent from 5.67 percent on Thursday. The bond market is
normally closed on Good Friday, but trading Friday occurred until
noon.
</P>
<P>
   The rally came after a two-day sell-off that started with the
report of data from National Association of Purchasing
Management-Chicago and continued with the report of the National
Association of Purchasing Management. Both reports indicated that
manufacturing had not only ended its decline of the last year but
was rebounding strongly.
</P>
<P>
   The signs of an additional lift to economic growth, given the
already strong consumer spending, made many traders worry more
about the possibility of an interest rate increase by the Federal
Reserve later this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the employment data showed that manufacturing employment
declined by 35,000 jobs last month and was down by 374,000 since
March 1998. ``The employment report does tend to alleviate some of
the anxieties from the purchasing managers reports,'' said Kevin
Flanagan, money market economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management,
said the March jobs data showed that ``at best, manufacturing has
just flattened out.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to calming fears about a surge in manufacturing, the
jobs report showed once again that the economy seems to be able to
grow strongly without generating inflationary pressures. One of the
key measures of wage inflation, hourly earnings, rose just
two-tenths of 1 percent last month, the same pace as in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we get another report saying the economy is strong and
labor is tight,'' said James E. Glassman, senior U.S. economist at
Chase Manhattan Bank. ``But there is no inflationary imbalance.''
The reason, he said, is that with the rest of the world's economy
growing sluggishly or worse, competition is preventing American
companies from making price increases stick.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts agreed that the low March job growth, which was
clearly held back by bad weather and was well below Wall Street
forecasts of 140,000, did not confirm that the economy was slowing
significantly from the torrid 6 percent pace of growth in the
fourth quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this uncertainty, interest rates are likely to remain
in their recent trading range, with long-term rates centered around
5.5 percent. They first jumped to this level in February after it
became clear that the economy entered 1999 at a much stronger pace
than expected and would not slow down quickly, as many Wall street
economists had forecast at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are elements of moderation coming through, but it is not
very compelling yet,'' said Glassman, whose forecast for the year
is one of the slower on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Fine said that consumer spending was still so strong that
barring a sudden collapse in the stock market, it would take some
time for the economy to slow significantly. He is forecasting 3
percent to 3.5 percent growth for the first quarter. He said such a
pace would normally be ``a little too rapid for the Fed.'' But
given that inflation remains in check and that the pace of growth
would be slowing, he said the Fed should be happy. ``If the Fed was
on hold before, this would give them more breathing room,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fine said that the Fed could not cut interest rates because the
economy was still too strong. But it cannot raise rates either, he
argued, because inflation is not a threat now and because of the
fragility of the global economy, with both Latin America and Asia
struggling to turn themselves around.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the performance of the futures contracts on the federal
funds rate, the Federal Reserve's target short-term interest rate,
some investors still think that the next move by the central bank
will be up. The yield on the contract for October has risen in the
last two days to 4.93 percent, which is almost a
quarter-percentage-point above the Fed's current 4.75 percent
target, which it left unchanged at its policy-making meeting
Tuesday.

FORMER PRESIDENT OF COSTA RICA URGES U.S. TO WORK FOR PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GRACE HOBSON  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAWRENCE, Kan. _ The United States should promote peace and
democracy by working to eliminate poverty and war, Nobel Peace
Laureate Oscar Arias said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a packed University of Kansas lecture hall, the
former president of Costa Rica warned that the current ethics of
war and greed would not suffice in the globalization of the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world expects you to be not only an economic superpower
and a military superpower but a moral superpower,'' Arias said.
</P>
<P>
   Arias won the Nobel Peace Prize for brokering an agreement in
1987 that ended fighting in Central America. Since then, he has
devoted his life to promoting world peace, democracy and
demilitarization.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of working for military security, Arias said, he works
for human security, which comes from wiping out illiteracy,
disease, poverty and environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
   Democracy in Latin America is made unstable by poverty,
especially the widening gap between the poor and wealthy. Arias
said Latin America had the world's widest income disparity.
</P>
<P>
   War threatens democracy even more, Arias said. And greed often
feeds war, he said, noting U.S. arms sales around the world.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. interests are served by spending more money on foreign aid
_ not military aid _ to promote human security, Arias said. A
fraction of the world's military spending would feed each person on
the planet over 10 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Americans think the U.S. government spends more on
foreign aid than any other expense, the amount is truly negligible,
Arias said. United States gives $700 million in foreign aid to
Africa _ that's $1 for each person, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest challenge is for us to create a new ethics,'' he
said. ``You need to be a moral superpower.''
</P>
<P>
   His speech kicked off a three-day symposium on Costa Rican
democracy, peace and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   A country's citizens are responsible for the actions of their
leaders, Arias told the students. Once citizens push for the ethics
of peace, human security and democracy, the people will find
themselves transformed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, we will create not only a better world but a new,
more compassionate people,'' he said.

PRE-SEASON INJURIES PLAGUE REVOLUTION, WIZARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ Major League Soccer teams cannot be expected to be
in midseason form. But rosters are beginning to resemble those of
teams which have already experienced a long campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution will be missing four starters and the Kansas City
Wizards three because of injury when they meet at Arrowhead Stadium
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 21 players on the Revolution roster, only 15 will be
available, necessitating the callup of John Kerr from the Boston
Bulldogs. The Wizards will be missing goalkeeper Tony Meola (knee)
and defenders Scott Bowers (concussion) and Scott Uderitz (knee).
</P>
<P>
   So, the Revolution will likely continue in their conservative
mode, relying on the goalkeeping of player-coach Walter Zenga. Last
week, they held the Miami Fusion scoreless until the final four
minutes and, though Kansas City has one of the most explosive
lineups in the league, the Wizards have failed to convert in two
games this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Injuries are a part of the game,'' Revolution defender Dan
Calichman said. ``But it's not as bad for us as some people think.
These are not major injuries. And what this does is gives other
guys the opportunity to step up and show what they can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kansas City has some big injuries, too, especially Tony
Meola's. But we can't call each other up and say we'll play
sometime later, when everyone is healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Revolution misfortunes are a portent, they could be
facing a difficult season. Yet, the defensive organization was
impressive and Zenga was spectacular, though without seeming to
have overextended himself, against Miami. The Revolution lost in
the post-match shootout, but were rewarded by the fact that they
held the lead for nearly the entire game and deprived Miami of a
3-point win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have won the game, but it's okay that it finished
1-1,'' Calichman said. ``We are going to be in a similar situation
now, so we have to be smart. We have to pick and choose our times.
We lost another key starter and we are going away, so we have to
try and steal a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Revolution habitually surrendered late goals,
but those errors usually were tie-breakers. In fact, during the
1998 season, the Revolution held the lead for only 130 minutes of
games against Eastern Conference opposition before being eliminated
from playoff contention. So, to have led the Fusion for 88 minutes
last Sunday, after Giovanni Savarese's opening-minute goal, should
be considered an accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   But Savarese will miss this match after suffering a tibia bruise
and ankle sprain during a Wednesday scrimmage against the New
Hampshire Phantoms. Since Carlos Rocha had been waived the previous
day, the Revolution were left with two forwards for this game.
</P>
<P>
   There is little room to manuever since midfielders Imad Baba
(groin), Edwin Gorter (suspension), John Harkes (knee), and Kris
Kelderman (knee) are also out.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened with Gio was crazy, a freak thing,'' Calichman
said. ``Their guys should have used better judgement, because Gio
had no chance to get out of the tackle. What happened to John
(Harkes) was he strained a ligament on his last pass of the day,
and Imad chose to have surgery in the preseason so he could be
ready four or five weeks into the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to set our goals, now. Because we don't have our best
13 available, we have to come up with a different way to beat a
team.''

JOHN F. `RED' FLAHERTY, 81; WAS AMERICAN LEAGUE UMPIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John F. ``Red'' Flaherty, who called 'em as he saw 'em as an
American League baseball umpire for 21 years, died of complications
of a stroke Thursday in his home in Falmouth. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   During his long career in the majors, Mr. Flaherty caught his
share of slings and arrows. In 1954, when he was officiating at a
game between the Washington Senators and the New York Yankees, he
called a Senator ``out'' at home plate when he tried to score from
second on a single. Attending the game was President Eisenhower,
who yelled out ``No.'' Later in the locker room, Mr. Flaherty was
asked whether Eisenhower's displeasure made him rethink his
position. ``No,'' said Mr. Flaherty. ``It wasn't even close.''
</P>
<P>
   After one memorable game in Fenway Park on May 16, 1973, the
headline over a story in the Globe the next day read ``Flaherty
Calls Leave Detroit Laughing, Sox Weeping 'n Bleeping.'' Red Sox
slugger Carl Yastrzemski said Mr. Flaherty should be umpiring in
the Little League, not the Major League.
</P>
<P>
   And what is it like to go to work knowing you're likely to be
cursed out by one side or the other?
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what it would be like when I went into umpiring,'' Mr.
Flaherty said in a story published in the Globe on May 22, 1973.
Like baseball, he said, umpiring goes in streaks. ``Sometimes you
go weeks without a beef and then you get one every other game,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm right, all the yelling in the world doesn't bother
me,'' he said. ``But, if I think I might had missed it, sure, I
have second thoughts. I worry about it.'' But he said he didn't
hold a grudge. ``You lose concentration if you think about past
arguments,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Flaherty was born in Marlborough, Mass. and grew up in
Maynard, Mass. He graduated from Boston College High School in 1936
and attended Boston College before serving in the Marine Corps in
the South Pacific during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He became an umpire in 1952. He worked in four World Series and
three All-Star games before his retirment in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Jeannette C. (Thompson); a son, Peter of
Falmouth, Mass.; and four grandchildren.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Lt. Charles-Philippe D'Orleans had no hesitation in
describing the 2,500 French troops deployed with him in Macedonia.
``They are highly mobile elite forces, the best we have,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The troops are based in Kumanovo, a few miles from the border
with Kosovo, and are flanked by a heavily armored British regiment
of 4,000 troops, whose equipment includes 14 Challenger tanks and
several armored personnel carriers, and a 3,000-strong elite German
force.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the soldiers could provide the nucleus for any NATO
ground force that goes into Kosovo, whether to secure a limited
area for the protection of ethnic Albanians or on some broader
mission.
</P>
<P>
   But a British officer, Capt. Simon Worthy, said there was no
question of changing the troops' mission, ``to provide the vanguard
of a force that would only deploy in Kosovo in the event of a peace
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation of these NATO forces, who have been placed under
the operational control of a British officer, Lt. Gen. Mike Jackson
of the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps, appears to illustrate the
contradictions in the West's military plans. The forces are in
Macedonia to reinforce a Kosovo peace plan seemingly overtaken by
events.
</P>
<P>
   That plan, offering autonomy guaranteed by a NATO presence to
the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo, was put together in Rambouillet,
France, before the NATO bombardment began, more than 250,000
Albanians were driven from their houses by Serbian forces, and the
West's perception of President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia
switched from bully to butcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think we can get back to Rambouillet,'' Robert
Hunter, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO said. ``At this stage, I
am in favor of doing what is needed to win the war. We need more
aggressive air power and intensive planning for possible use of
ground forces to unsettle Milosevic and get across to him that he
will lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Western officials insisted that after an early review that had
found that 200,000 troops would be needed to invade Kosovo and that
the public would never support such a move no active planning to
use ground forces was under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``One would be crazy to say we would never use ground forces,''
Lt. Col. Christopher Deverell of the British Defense Ministry said.
``But it is basically nonsensical. There are no plans. The idea is
extremely remote and in any event, a suitable force would take
months to assemble.''
</P>
<P>
   The West's plan seems to consist of pursuing a military aim for
which there is scant, if any, successful precedent, dislodging an
army, the Serbian forces that are marauding in Kosovo, with air
power alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sure would have loved to stop the North Koreans or Saddam
with air power, but things don't work that way,'' a retired
general, Ed Soyster, said. ``If you're dug in right, you can
survive artillery, let alone air power. You can punish someone with
air power. But I don't believe you can stop an army.''
</P>
<P>
   If that is the case, the pressure to use ground troops could
mount. The mission of the Western troops in Macedonia has already
changed once, from an ``extraction force'' for the 1,500 officials
of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe who were
in Kosovo until the bombing began, to a force to carry out any
possible peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Recent Balkan history shows that such elite troops can easily
change hats. When a Rapid Reaction Force, made up mainly of British
and French elements, was sent to Bosnia in 1995, its mission was
portrayed as essentially helping to protect U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   But when NATO bombing of Bosnian Serb positions began in August
1995, the Rapid Reaction Force artillery was quickly put to use
against the Serbs. It proved devastating.
</P>
<P>
   In all, there are close to 12,000 NATO troops in Macedonia,
including 950 Italians, more than 200 Dutch troops, and 400 of
various nationalities attached to the Rapid Reaction Corps
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Those headquarters moved from Rheindahlen, Germany, to Macedonia
a few weeks ago, an action that clearly illustrates the scale of
NATO's new operations in Macedonia. In all, a force of 28,000 was
planned to carry out any peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Moving the headquarters appears to suggest that the alliance
planned from the outset for a rapidly adaptable presence in the
area just south of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the European troops, 350 American soldiers in
Macedonia are maintaining a camp near the capital, Skopje, that
would be a staging area for a Kosovo deployment in the event of a
settlement. The three American soldiers captured near the Yugoslav
border are from that element.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that any move into Kosovo would have to be led
by the Americans. The Europeans have less traumatic fear of
casualties than Americans _ the French had 56 dead in Bosnia and
scarcely blinked _ but they also learned from Bosnia that if the
Allies do not act in concert, disarray ensues.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The most readily transportable American forces in Europe are in
the Southern European Task Force, a 4,000-member airborne light
infantry brigade based in Vicenza, Italy; the 24th Marine
Expeditionary Unit in the Adriatic, with 2,000 troops and materiel
like attack helicopters and tanks, and the 1,000-members Special
Forces drawn from the Army, Navy and Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond those troops, the United States still has a large
military presence in Europe, although much reduced over the decade
since the Cold War ended. Whereas more than 300,000 American
soldiers were in Europe in 1989, just over 100,000 are stationed
there now.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the U.S. European Command in Stuttgart, Germany,
Capt. Tim Taylor, said the United States had 70,000 troops in
Germany, principally in the 1st Infantry Division in Wurzberg and
the 1st Armored Division in Bad Kreuznach. An additional 11,500
troops are stationed in Italy, 10,000 in Britain, and close to
7,000 in Bosnia, with smaller presences elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Of the troops, 65,000 are in the Army, 34,000 in the Air Force,
10,000 in the Navy and 1,000 in the Special Forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our power in Europe is considerable,'' Hunter said. ``But you
have to decide if you are prepared to take risks. Right now we are
pursuing a very low-risk strategy, even in the air war. You also
have to decide if you want to get rid of Europe's last Communist
thug, Milosevic. And then you have to stick with it.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, D'Orleans' crack French forces in Macedonia
and other allied troops seem highly unlikely to move. ``There is
simply no support in NATO for a massive land invasion,'' said a
spokesman for the Pentagon, Lt. Col. Steve Campbell.

REFUGEES SEEN AS A POWERFUL DESTABILIZING FORCE IN REGION

   SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Refugees fleeing marauding Serb troops
could destabilize or even topple the governments of Macedonia,
Albania and Montenegro, a spillover of the Yugoslav air war that
would amount to Slobodan Milosevic's revenge against those he
considers collaborators campaigning to destroy him.
</P>
<P>
   Already, ethnic Albanian refugees have put enormous strains on
Albania, Europe's poorest country; Macedonia, a poor country of
just 2 million; and even tiny Montenegro, the semi-autonomous
Yugoslav province thus far spared the bloody turmoil that has swept
the Balkans through most of this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav President Milosevic blames Albania for fomenting
separatist sentiment in Kosovo, and for channeling money and guns
to the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army. The Belgrade regime also
resents Macedonia for quitting the Yugoslav Federation in 1991, and
it despises Montenegro's pro-western government.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro may be headed for a showdown with Milosevic that
could plunge it into civil war. Macedonians, meanwhile, fear the
90,000 ethnic Albanians who have arrived here since the NATO
bombing began will never leave, changing the ethnic mix so greatly
that the nascent democratic government will collapse.
</P>
<P>
   As for Albania, as one western diplomat put it, ``I never
thought Albania could get worse, but it has this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats, especially those from NATO countries, have
spent days reassuring the Macedonian government that they will
provide money to deal with the flood of refugees. Christopher Hill,
the US ambassador to Macedonia, has encouraged the government to
become more like western European nations, and worries the refugee
crisis will stunt democratization here.
</P>
<P>
   In Montenegro, the American smart bombs and cruise missiles
slamming into military installations and strategic facilities
across Yugoslavia are giving Milosevic the excuse he has long
sought to undermine the republic's own fragile new democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of a military coup intensified, fueled by a clampdown on
news broadcasts by Montenegro television and the replacement of the
commander of Yugoslav forces in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro's president, Milo Djukanovic, conceded his government
may be facing its most desperate hour as ethnic Albanian refugees
pour over from neighboring Kosovo and NATO air attacks fan the
flames of Serbian nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a serious and authentic danger that even our state
may disappear and burn down in violence,'' Djukanovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though NATO's warplanes have struck some targets in
Montenegro, the Djukanovic government has shown its disdain for the
authoritarian federal regime in Belgrade by refusing to acknowledge
the state of war proclaimed by Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we do not like that a war is being waged against
Yugoslavia, of which we are still a part,'' said a senior
government official. ``But also we have some understanding of why
the West is acting against the illegal and vicious Milosevic
regime, and we are sympathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Those sympathies are no secret, and Belgrade's appointment this
week of a hard-line army general, Milorad Obradovic, to take
command of the 10,000 Yugoslav troops in Montenegro was seen by
many officials and analysts as a dangerous sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is sleeping at night. There is tremendous fear that
Montenegro will fall into the Balkans abyss,'' said Drasko
Junarovic, editor of the independent news magazine Monitor. ``The
next few days will be absolutely critical for our future as a free
place.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana warned Milosevic that NATO
would stop any attempt by Belgrade to overthrow the Montenegrin
government.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 600,000 inhabitants of Montenegro share the Orthodox
Christian faith and feel a strong ethnic bond with the Serbs who
dominate the rest of Yugoslavia. Similarly, Macedonians who make up
65 percent of this country's population are also Orthodox Slavs.
</P>
<P>
   Support for Montenegro's first democratic government, elected
only last year, has plunged precipitously since the Western air
offensive began, and pro-Serbian sentiment is plainly on the rise.
The Macedonian government fears its fragile coalition could
collapse if the refugee crisis worsens, as it likely will.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every bomb that drops makes Montenegrins feel more loyal to
the Greater Yugoslavia,'' said Zoran Zizic, leader of the
ultra-nationalist Socialist People's Party, which supports
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday, Montenegro government television had been
broadcasting news reports from CNN and other Western news media. It
was the only network in Yugoslavia providing viewers a glimpse of
the forced expulsions of Albanians from Kosovo by Serb paramilitary
forces, as well as a Western perspective on the NATO attack. But
under pressure from Belgrade, Montenegro stopped the Western news
reports, replacing them with government-controlled broadcasts from
Yugoslavia. There has not been similar censorship in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Many Montenegrins are furious at the air attacks and make no
attempt to hide their hatred for the Western reporters working from
Podgorica. Cars carrying armed young men coursed through the
capital with horns blaring in celebration of the capture of three
US soldiers by Serb forces Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans make war against our country, and we have captured
some enemy soldiers,'' said Zizic. ``That is natural in war. Why do
you Americans think only Yugoslavs can suffer in this conflict?''
</P>
<P>
   For Albania, Europe's poorest and least-developed nation, the
refugee crisis is a fiscal nightmare as well as a human tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   When the refugee flood began, there were only 4,500 beds left of
the 6,000 spaces created in refugee centers last year, when ethnic
Albanians first started fleeing Kosovo. Further, many of the nearly
24,000 refugees who arrived last year found apartments, but are
running out of money to stay in them.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, Albania is not strong enough to handle a massive
refugee crisis, a senior Western diplomat said. The current
government, headed by 31-year-old Pandeli Majko, is seen by some
analysts as a caretaker regime, holding the country delicately in
place while rival politicians solidify their support.
</P>
<P>
   The disruption of a massive refugee influx could lead to unwise,
early elections, which would be ``out of the question,'' the
diplomat said. ``If you could call a country suicidal, that would
be it,'' the Western official said.

COMMENTARY: TIME TO GET SERIOUS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ U.S. policy toward the terrorism of Slobodan
Milosevic has been constrained in the past by our public's wariness
of military involvement abroad. We remember Vietnam and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   But that political-psychological calculus may have changed, I
believe, under the impact of the Serbian atrocities in Kosovo. Most
Americans do not want to temporize with Milosevic. We want to
finish the job.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in his CBS interview with Dan Rather the
other night, said he ``would urge the American people ... to have a
little more resolve here.'' But the people are looking to the
president for resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Those terrified women and children stumbling out of Kosovo are
on our conscience now. When Rather observed in the interview that
Milosevic was winning in Kosovo, Clinton replied, ``We knew that
that would happen in the first few days.'' If he knew, why weren't
he and NATO prepared to act much more decisively?
</P>
<P>
   Decisiveness and commitment are crucial now. If we let Milosevic
complete his ethnic cleansing and genocide in Kosovo, it will be
the greatest human catastrophe in Europe since World War II. And it
will be the end of belief in NATO, a belief that has kept the peace
in Europe for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   These are among the steps that the United States and its allies
must take:
</P>
<P>
   1. Commit ourselves to the total destruction of Milosevic's
armed forces, no matter how long it takes. NATO bombers in the
first week carried out daily only a fraction of the sorties
undertaken in the Persian Gulf War. The intensity should be at
least as high as in the gulf, and this time the equivalent of
Saddam Hussein's Republican Guard must not escape. The bombing in
Belgrade must mean the targeting of command and control centers. We
should also quickly hit Yugoslav broadcasting facilities, a key
factor in Milosevic's power.
</P>
<P>
   2. Prepare to send NATO ground troops into Kosovo as a
protection force for the ethnic Albanians who have not yet been
murdered or expelled. Ten thousand troops can be there within days.
Others must follow as needed, perhaps 20,000 to 40,000.
</P>
<P>
   3. Begin supplying weapons to the Kosovo Liberation Army. This
cannot be a short-run answer to the Milosevic policemen and
paramilitaries who are terrorizing civilians; even getting guns to
the KLA will be difficult. But we have to start enabling the
victims to protect themselves.
</P>
<P>
   4. Announce that the United States and its allies are abandoning
the plan for Kosovo ``autonomy'' that was on the table in the
failed negotiations in Rambouillet, France. Milosevic's cruelties
have ended any possibility of Kosovars being ruled by Serbia. For
the next several years Kosovo should be policed and controlled
internationally.
</P>
<P>
   5. Commit the alliance to the return of all refugees to Kosovo.
The international community will have to feed and house them until
their homes and villages are rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   6. Call on the International War Crimes Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia to indict Milosevic and all others involved in his
crimes against humanity in Kosovo. The tribunal's prosecutors have
been remiss in not building a case against him long before now, for
the crimes he directed in Bosnia; and the U.S. government has
failed to give the tribunal the large amount of evidence it has
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Those commitments must be believed _ by Milosevic and by the
people of the United States and the other NATO countries. That
means that there can be no bombing pauses to let Milosevic reflect,
no return to fruitless diplomacy. Our terms must be clear and
unchanging.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has bet again and again that the United States does
not have the backbone to stand up against his viciousness and
guile. So far he has won. If he wins again, the price to this
country and the Western alliance will be devastating.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton is the man who has to prove that Milosevic is
wrong. If he speaks firmly and consistently, if he acts decisively,
he will have the support of the American people _ and of Congress.
Senate Republicans who matter, from John McCain to Richard Lugar,
are urging him to be tough.
</P>
<P>
   If Americans had the illusion that peace and human decency can
be defended in this world without pain and casualties, the illusion
is fading. What we need now is leadership.

   BEIJING _ The food scarcity engulfing North Korea will worsen in
the next two months because government rations, on which a majority
of the population depends, are running out and will not be
restocked until the summer harvest, a senior aid official said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now entering the most difficult months of the year,''
said David Morton, the U.N. aid coordinator for North Korea, at a
briefing in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   For the next two months, Morton said, much of the population
will have to depend on so-called substitute foods _ cakes or
noodles made from corn stalks, cabbage stalks or grass ground with
grain _ or on wild roots and grasses they scrounge themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The most acute scarcity will ease in June and July when potato
and vegetable crops are harvested, officials say, although the
country will remain chronically short of food.
</P>
<P>
   People in cities and towns tend to be the worst off in famines,
aid workers have found, especially if they rely for income on
industries that are now nearly idle for lack of fuel or raw
materials. Fewer than one-third of North Korea's people work on
farms, where there is often access to more food.
</P>
<P>
   Food aid from abroad, supplied mostly by the United States and
channeled through the U.N. World Food Program, is mainly directed
to young children in nursery schools and kindergartens, with some
going to hospitals. In a new push, aid agencies are trying to feed
more pregnant and nursing mothers and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   But the aid can help only a fraction of the population and
offers no long-term answer, Morton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're keeping alive a generation of children,'' he said. ``But
this is only a holding action.''
</P>
<P>
   As other foreign visitors to North Korea have, Morton described
a country where malnutrition has stunted most children and weakened
many adults, where hospitals and schools have no heat and little
food and where water supplies are unsanitary because there is no
chlorine for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Famine, defined as an extreme scarcity of food, remains a
reality for much of the population,'' a U.N. strategy paper
concluded last month. An unknown number of people, by some evidence
in the millions, have died as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Morton took issue with charges that have been made by some
refugees that much of the aid is being diverted to the army and
political elites. Those groups vastly prefer rice to the corn and
wheat in the aid program, he said, and national supplies meet their
needs.
</P>
<P>
   While U.N. monitors must travel with escorts and usually must
declare their destinations in advance, they visit all regions where
aid is given to see if schools and hospitals have received their
allotments. ``We believe, from what we see, that they are getting
the food,'' Morton said.
</P>
<P>
   Though the country's agricultural production has been hurt by
floods and droughts, the famine's roots lie in the collapse of the
Soviet Union in 1991, most experts now believe, when North Korea
lost its major supplier of fuel, fertilizer, industrial inputs and
farm equipment. It has been unable to replace those supplies
through foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Per capita income fell to less than $500 by 1996 from more than
$1,000 in 1992, according to international estimates. Fertilizer
plants went idle, tractors had little fuel, irrigation pumps lacked
electricity and food production plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, fuel was so scarce that 90 percent of the country's
rice fields were not plowed after the harvest, the usual practice
to suppress weeds and pests. That factor alone will reduce the next
harvest by 12 percent, a North Korean official has said.
</P>
<P>
   Simply rebuilding agriculture will not solve the problem, Morton
said, because North Korea has limited arable land.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an industrial country,'' he said. ``What it needs is
an economic revival.''
</P>
<P>
   But for both political and economic reasons, other countries are
reluctant to provide large-scale economic aid. So long as North
Korea refuses to make major reforms in its closed, Communist
economy, many experts say, such aid may only prop up the system
that helped cause the current famine.

UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AT 1970 LOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation generated 46,000 jobs in March, far below the
scorching pace in recent months, an indication that the US economy
may be cooling.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Department of Labor said Friday that enough new jobs
were added to push the March unemployment rate down to 4.2 percent,
its lowest level since 1970. The unemployment rate was 4.4 percent
in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone expects the economy and job growth to
continue to roar along as it has in the past,'' said Denis
McSweeney, New England's commissioner for the federal Bureau of
Labor Statistics, which releases the monthly unemployment report.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said several factors hampered job growth, ranging
from cold weather in March to Americans' preference for buying
low-cost imports rather than home-made goods, a trend that has
produced a record US trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The goods-producing sector, including construction,
manufacturing and oil companies, lost 89,000 jobs in March. Job
growth in the service and retail sectors, which have driven much of
the country's blockbuster growth, slowed markedly, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the 46,000 new jobs created in March, according to the
bureau's survey of business payrolls, were only a quarter as much
as a consensus of economists had predicted _ between 165,000 and
200,000.
</P>
<P>
   March job growth was the weakest it has been since January 1996
when severe snowstorms froze economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   In February, payrolls grew 297,000; that figure was revised
upward from a previously reported 275,000, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer new jobs may be fallout from an eight-year expansion that
has caused an acute shortage of workers, economists said. If
companies cannot find people to hire, they cannot create as many
positions as they would in a slack labor market.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is now the longest peace-time recovery in history, and
what's happened is, at this point, pretty much anybody who wants a
job has already got one,'' said Nicholas Perna, chief economist for
Fleet Financial Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Eight million people in the nation now hold more than one job,
the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
   The labor force _ the number employed plus the number of people
who are actively looking for work _ shrank by 455,000 in March.
</P>
<P>
   There were other signs of slowing. The average work week edged
down by 0.1 hour to 34.5 hours, while average hourly wages rose 3
cents, to $13.09, the bureau reported.
</P>
<P>
   March marked the second consecutive monthly decline in the size
of the labor force, according to a separate survey by the bureau of
US households, which the agency used to estimate the month jobless
rate. It has not seen a two-months' decline in years, though
economists said that it was too early declare a new trend has
emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever dark clouds lurk in the data, William Cheney, chief
economist for John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., the economy
is still ``going extraordinarily well.''
</P>
<P>
   This state's economy continues to be strong, according to a new
index published by the University of Massachusetts. The index of
current economic activity increased by 5.8 percent in January, to
122.8. Last October, the index was 121.4.
</P>
<P>
   The index is based on Massachusetts employment and tax receipts
data.
</P>
<P>
   Despite recessions in Japan, Southeast Asia, Russia and looming
troubles in Latin America, Hancock's Cheney said the fact that the
US economy keeps growing ``does seem kind of bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   But he noted this growth has lured overseas investors to put
their money into the US investment markets. Indeed, a soaring Dow
Jones Industrial average closed above the 10,000 mark this week,
and market analysts attributed it partly to a steep rise in money
flowing in from overseas. Markets were closed Friday for Good
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   When financial crises first broke in Asia in 1997 and continued
into 1998, Hancock's Cheney said, ``I was assuming it would be a
net drag on the United States but I hadn't foreseen this flight to
safety'' in the United States.

IN MACEDONIA, THE STREAM OF REFUGEES FILLS A VALLEY

<P>
   BLACE, Macedonia _ The valley hummed with thousands of voices,
the hillside and fields below shifted constantly with crowds of
people. Along the train tracks a steady line of stumbling figures
moved forward to join the human mass.
</P>
<P>
   Well over 10,000 refugees from Kosovo are camped here in the
open, just over the border, in Macedonia. They are still arriving
by the thousands, turning the fields into a sprawling refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   They have come from Kosovo's capital, Pristina, and other towns,
herded at gunpoint by the Serbian police into trains, trucks and
buses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police ordered us out of the house,'' said Zenel Krasniqi,
an ethnic Albanian builder from Pristina. ``They put us in a line,
along with all the neighbors, and marched us to the railroad
station,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After a night in the station with thousands of other displaced
people, under guard of armed police, they were loaded on a train
and sent to the border. On the Serbian side of the border, they
were ordered out and told to walk along the tracks into Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone told the same story. Some arrived by trucks and buses,
most of them from Pristina, others from Urosevac, or Ferizaj as the
Albanians know it, a town of some 70,000 people south of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   The flood into Macedonia, an estimated 90,000 refugees since
March 24, has completely overwhelmed the Macedonian authorities.
Soldiers were brought in to stem the flow along the railroad
tracks, and riot police armed with automatic weapons and wearing
flak jackets and helmets formed a barrier to block refugees from
the main road.
</P>
<P>
   NATO announced Friday that its soldiers would do whatever
possible to help with the influx of refugees into Macedonia and
look into what NATO could do to assist the U.N. High Commission for
Refugees in dealing with the crowds pouring in from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers admitted they had been taken by surprise by the
sudden rush of people in the last few days. ``We did not think such
a wave would arrive,'' said a Swiss representative of the Red
Cross, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   She estimated there were more than 10,000 refugees gathered, and
many more on the other side waiting to cross. NATO estimated the
number of people waiting to leave Kosovo on Friday at 25,000. And
one person who had driven to Macedonia estimated the line of
refugees waiting to get in by car was about five miles long. ``The
situation is getting dramatic, the Red Cross worker said. ``In one
or two days there will be people dying, the youngest and the
oldest.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one field hospital was working. Men struggled through the
crowd carrying an unconscious man into the tent, past a line of
women and babies. Old people sat on blankets outside.
</P>
<P>
   The police were enforcing strict controls to register the
refugees, but with only one table and one book, the line was barely
moving at the major border crossing. Refugees registering said they
had been lined up for seven hours, since before dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Families arriving collapsed where they stood, lying down in the
field among their few belongings, huddling under blankets and
plastic sheets as rain began to lash down. Some made wood fires,
others were trying to build shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Krasniqi was splicing a tree branch with a penknife, making
supports for a tent for his pair of tiny grandchildren asleep on
the ground. With his children, cousins, and elderly mother-in-law,
there were 15 people camped together on two square yards of earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would never have gone if they had not forced us,'' he said.
He and his wife, Fatima Krasniqi, said they did not blame NATO for
their plight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were happy that NATO bombs were falling; they were only
falling on military targets,'' she said. ``We were not afraid. We
even opened the windows to watch. If we did not have NATO, they
would have massacred all of us.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Syled Baftia, a man of 84, half blind and nearly deaf, sat tall
and defiant on the ground among his family. ``They are putting
children out in the rain,'' he said of the Serbs. His family fled
to Pristina after Serbian troops burned their village last year, he
said. Now they had been forced from Pristina at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing good will come of the Serbs after this. They forced us
out of our property,'' he said. ``Those are our lands, my family
has lived there for 500 years. But Belgrade will never own
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   For now though, his family had nowhere to go. ``We are sleeping
here on the ground, nine people to two blankets,'' his son, Tahir
Baftia, said. ``We cannot survive this, with all these people.
Europe has only four or five days to decide something.''
</P>
<P>
   Just behind the Baftia family, stumbling, eyes dazed with shock,
came the new arrivals along the train tracks. ``Ferizaj,'' they
said, mumbling the name of their home town as they walked, their
heads bent, exhaustion in their faces.
</P>
<P>
   A family bumped an old woman along in a wheelbarrow, another
dragged a young handicapped boy in a wheelchair. A young man
staggered as he heaved his grandfather onto his back to carry him.
</P>
<P>
   They described an exodus of extraordinary proportions from their
home towns. Naser Dubova and his family had spent the last 10 days
moving from house to house as the police cleared whole districts.
Finally the police and paramilitaries caught up with them and told
them to leave. ```Go anywhere, but leave,' they said'' Dubova
recounted. The family then tried for three days to find transport
out of the town.
</P>
<P>
   They slept at the train station in Urosevac, and then as more
and more people poured into the station amid rising panic, they
fought their way onto a convoy of buses that the Serbian
authorities organized to take them to the border. From there the
police ordered them to walk along the railroad tracks into
Macedonia, warning them that both sides of the tracks were mined.
</P>
<P>
   Farther up the track, a last group of exhausted refugees had sat
down to rest. ``Are there police further along? Are they separating
the men from the women?'' they asked. They were already in
Macedonia, but were clearly terrified their ordeal would continue.
</P>
<P>
   Few refugees recounted stories of killings, although several
said they had seen two or three bodies lying beside the train
tracks on the journey. Most families seemed to have escaped
together, men, women and children, unharmed if traumatized.
</P>
<P>
   At mid-afternoon a train carrying six cars disgorged thousands
more refugees from Pristina into the field. They said there were
many more people still in Pristina waiting at the station for
transport out.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Martin Feldstein is a public policy figure of the first
magnitude. He has been adviser to Republican presidents, but he
also presides over the National Bureau of Economic Research, a
non-partisan meeting place where economists seek to narrow
differences of opinion among business, labor, and government. He's
a college professor, who has taught introductory economics to
thousands of Harvard students. He is a mild, decent, and likeable
man, accustomed to building consensus.
</P>
<P>
   So when you find him making technically correct but otherwise
highly misleading statements in the newspapers, you know something
very interesting must be going on.
</P>
<P>
   Under the headline, ``Common Ground on Social Security,''
Feldstein wrote last week in The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
   ``Repeated attempts to characterize the difference between the
Republican approach and the President's plan as a major ideological
clash are fundamentally wrong, based on either a misunderstanding
of what the Republicans propose or a desire to prevent compromise
in order to use Social Security as an election issue in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Decode that sentence and you have the key to undertanding where
the Social Security debate is headed.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, between those who want to preserve the current system
pretty much as it is and those who want to change it all together,
the ideological chasm could scarely be deeper.
</P>
<P>
   The difference of opinion has to do with where Americans in the
21st century will choose to set the boundary between the market and
non-market spheres _ between the community and the individual.
</P>
<P>
   In one camp are traditionalists, who want to preserve pretty
much intact the ``three-legged stool'' of a retirement system that
evolved out of the New Deal reforms of the 1930s _ private savings,
company plans, and a realistic but hardly generous universal
government safety net.
</P>
<P>
   In the other are the reformers, personalizers, and privatizers
of one sort or another, economists for the most part, or
representatives of financial firms. They want to replace or at
least augment the collective system with a system of individual
accounts, designed to foster personal savings.
</P>
<P>
   The difference of opinion is captured nicely in the slogans of
the rival camps: Social Security vs. Personal Security.
</P>
<P>
   One thing upon which virtually all analysts agree is that the
Social Security system requires some kind of work. If taxes are not
raised slightly, or benefits cut, the system will cease to be able
to pay 100 cents on each dollar of claims, starting about 2034.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing at all were changed between now and then, the Social
Security system would pay only about 75 percent of promised
benefits, then and for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans see this both as a serious crisis and an opportunity
to change the system with a view to making it more of an engine of
economic growth. Democrats in general are seeking a technical fix,
though their plan .
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has proposed a simple plan (with a complicated
rationale) in which about 60 percent of projected budget surpluses
in the next 15 years would be put aside to extend Social Security's
solvency until at least 2055.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve the actuarial balance over the full 75-year horizon
that has been the historical rule, some small further combination
of tax increases and benefit cuts also would be required _ but not
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan, which was designed for the most part by
Feldstein, would use the surpluses to create personal accounts
owned by individual workers. These would permit workers to pursue
higher returns in the stock market, though many details are up in
the air.
</P>
<P>
   When Feldstein says the differences between his plan and
Clinton's ``are not as great as they may seem,'' he is focusing on
two subsidiary matters they have in common to confuse the issue. It
is true that Clinton recommended investing some portion of the
Social Security trust fund on Wall Street, in hopes of capturing
some of the higher returns that have traditionally accrued to
stocks and stimulating national saving.
</P>
<P>
   It is true, also, that Clinton called for the government to set
up a system of individual retirement accounts for all citizens in
order to foster individual savings. But Clinton proposed to keep
such IRAs quite separate from the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clinton's proposal to have a semi-autonomous government
corporation accumulate large stakes in US companies through the
purchase of index funds is quite different from the individual
investments in stocks that the GOP plan envisages. Clinton's plan
for universal IRAs is also entirely secondary to maintaining the
integrity of the ``three-legged stool.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What possible reason, other that partisan fears about
`tinkering with the system' is there for keeping the accounts
separate?'' Feldstein demanded to know.
</P>
<P>
   There, in a nutshell, is the deep difference of opinion exposed.
Traditionalists view all attempts to ``personalize'' Social
Security as ultimately destabilizing to the system itself. Once the
well-to-do are free to chase the higher returns for themselves,
traditionalists expect that support for the system of universal
benefits will erode. A profound force for equality and inclusion
will have been lost.
</P>
<P>
   The real difference of opinion, therefore, is not between the
GOP and ``the President's plan'' _ an inventive political document
from a lame duck who may be disproportionately concerned with his
``legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   It is between those who want to act now, and those who want to
turn the next election into a referendum on Social Security.

<P>
   ALGIERS, Algeria _ Omar Bellouchet's name is not on the ballot
for the presidential election on April 15, an election that many of
Algeria's voters see as a gateway to democracy. But many Algerians
consider him and others like him at least as important to hopes of
freedom as any of the presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Bellouchet, 46, is editor in chief of El Watan (The Nation), the
most spirited of a dozen independent newspapers that have sprung up
in the 1990s. He has been a champion of liberties that Algerians
have been denied by a repressive oligarchy of generals and
bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   For Bellouchet, as for hundreds of Algerian editors and
reporters, it has been a bitter decade.
</P>
<P>
   More than 70 journalists have been killed during the conflict
that erupted in 1992 between the government and armed Islamic
groups when the military canceled an election that the Islamists
seemed poised to win.
</P>
<P>
   Some have died in car bombings, others from bombs that exploded
at their offices, but most from shootings. In the most brutal case,
Yasmine Drici, a reporter for Le Soir d'Algerie, had her throat cut
by uniformed men who stopped her at a roadblock in Algiers in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Bellouchet has survived two assassination attempts and a stint
in police custody in 1993 on charges of printing ``premature
information'' about the killing of six police officers. The case is
still dragging through the courts, although the original report was
confirmed within days.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of a dozen cases still pending against El Watan and
its editor under a web of restrictive press laws. In two cases,
including the one involving the killing of the policemen,
Bellouchet faces jail terms if appeals go against him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 the editor's wife, Nacera, died of a heart attack. She
was 30 years old. He blames the pressures his work brought on his
family, including an attempt by two gunmen that year to kill him
while he was dropping off his two small children at school.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 two other gunmen followed him as he left an Algiers
courthouse, but he outran them and found sanctuary in the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   With the tempo of the conflict with the Islamic rebels now
sharply reduced and the generals promising to allow a democratic
evolution through the presidential election, the pressures have
diminished, but they are not gone.
</P>
<P>
   Like many editors and reporters, Bellouchet continues to live in
a heavily guarded compound on the outskirts of Algiers. His
newspaper, like other independent papers, has its offices in
another high-walled compound in the heart of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrenching press freedom in a country like this is a
difficult business,'' Bellouchet said. ``You move forward, you get
hit, you fall down; you get up, move forward, get hit again. It's a
never-ending process. It's not something that happens in an
intellectuals' salon, amid the niceties of fine debate.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The struggle entered a new phase after 1988, when riots in the
streets of Algerian cities forced the military oligarchy to
introduce a new constitution permitting opposition political
parties and independent newspapers. But especially since the
conflict with the Islamic rebels began, the liberties inscribed in
the constitution have often proved more theoretical than real.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from prosecutions on charges of impugning the armed forces
or libeling senior officials with articles alleging corruption,
restrictive laws have been used to close El Watan and other
independent newspapers for weeks, and sometimes months.
</P>
<P>
   Editors and reporters, including Bellouchet, have faced long
periods under ``judicial control,'' which requires them to report
regularly to police stations and bars them from leaving the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Because the government owns all the country's printing presses,
it has been able to block individual issues, or to force the
censorship of articles it has disapproved of.
</P>
<P>
   It has also favored some papers _ and disfavored others _ by
assigning advertising by state-owned businesses. Typically, papers
that have taken an uncritical view of the government's tactics in
fighting the Islamic rebels have been rewarded, and papers like El
Watan have been starved.
</P>
<P>
   For El Watan, a cooperative owned by 18 of its editors and
reporters, this has meant surviving on minimal wages, currently
about $300 a month in the case of El Watan's reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But the paper's circulation, currently 100,000 copies a day, has
continued to rise, and Bellouchet and fellow editors at other
independent papers have not been cowed.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, they have continued to raise what has become
one of the central questions about the conflict between the
government and the rebels, an issue known among French-speaking
Algerians as ``Qui tue qui?'' _ literally, ``Who is killing whom?''
</P>
<P>
   One of the pending court cases against the editor involves an
appeal against a one-year jail term on charges of ``impugning the
security of the state'' by saying on French television that not all
the journalists who have been killed have been victims of Islamic
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The editor did not say whom he suspected of the killings, but
just by raising the issue he touched on the most sensitive of all
the government's nerves.
</P>
<P>
   International human rights groups have suggested that there may
have been government complicity in massacres that killed hundreds
of villagers at a time in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But Bellouchet, after inconclusive investigations by El Watan,
believes that most of the massacres may have been the work of the
rebels, and that others may have been carried out by private groups
settling local vendettas or engaged in local land-grabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Le Pouvoir has used violence to fight violence,'' Bellouchet
said, using a popular French word for the ruling generals that
means the Power.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some cases, doubtlessly, things got out of hand; people
pushed aside the law, and got involved in some unpleasant things.
But I don't believe that Le Pouvoir would ever have said to the
army, `Go and kill whole villages, and make it look like the works
of the Islamists.' No, that I cannot believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Bellouchet is optimistic that the generals are
sincere in promising to step down.
</P>
<P>
   One encouraging sign has been the appointment of a new
information minister, Abdelaziz Rahabi, a former diplomat who has
begun his tenure by licensing the establishment of independent
printing presses, ending favoritism in the assignment of government
advertising and _ unheard of for government ministers in the past _
taking editors like Bellouchet out to lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are still dramatic and difficult times, but their main
characteristic is an overwhelming popular flight from all forms of
autocracy and oppression, whether in the form of military
authoritarianism or religious extremism,'' Bellouchet said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole society wants to move forward, and for the first
time now those pushing forward are more powerful than those pushing
back.''

   WASHINGTON -- NATO and the U.S. military are stepping up their
aid for the thousands of refugees fleeing Kosovo, Lt. Gen. John
McDuffie of the Joint Chiefs of Staff announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military this weekend will begin flying 500,000 meals
to Tirana, Albania, and distribute them from there. Each meal pack,
from an army depot in Dover, Pa., contains one day's complete
requirements for one person.
</P>
<P>
   The meals are being airlifted because food stored in Pristina,
Kosovo, was destroyed, while other supplies are in warehouses in
Belgrade and Montenegro. Relief organizations are trying to shift
these supplies to where they are most needed.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military will also move tents, blankets, cots, and
sleeping bags already in Europe into Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO already is sending C-130s loaded with food and other
supplies for the refugees, said Jamie Shea, a NATO spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
   McDuffie also said the 12,000-man NATO peace-keeping force in
Macedonia will help with the inflow of refugees at border crossings
and with humanitarian efforts. He said the number of refugees
entering Macedonia is expected to grow by 50 percent over the next
three days.
</P>
<P>
   The involvement of military forces in relief efforts came in
response to requests by several humanitarian organizations to
support the transportation and organization of relief materials.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, representatives from 15 aid organizations met with
President Clinton to discuss U.S. support of humanitarian efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Bell, president of the relief organization CARE, said
ideas included:
</P>
<P>
   Additional support to countries accepting heavy flows of
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraging other nations to open their borders to refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Providing cargo planes to deliver supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Security for aid workers and refugees near the Kosovo border.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one foresaw how rapidly the refugees would pour out of
Kosovo,'' Bell said. ``There is a substantial need for more staff
and more supplies on the ground more rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell said CARE has received $500,000 from Australia, $200,000
from the German government, and $200,000 from the William H. Gates
Foundation to support relief efforts.

<P>
   BLACE, Macedonia _ The valley hummed with thousands of voices,
the hillside and fields below shifted constantly with crowds of
people. Along the train tracks a steady line of stumbling figures
moved forward to join the human mass.
</P>
<P>
   Well over 10,000 refugees from Kosovo are camped here in the
open, just over the border, in Macedonia. They are still arriving
by the thousands, turning the fields into a sprawling refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   They have come from Kosovo's capital, Pristina, and other towns,
herded at gunpoint by the Serbian police into trains, trucks and
buses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police ordered us out of the house,'' said Zenel Krasniqi,
an ethnic Albanian builder from Pristina. ``They put us in a line,
along with all the neighbors, and marched us to the railroad
station,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After a night in the station with thousands of other displaced
people, under guard of armed police, they were loaded on a train
and sent to the border. On the Serbian side of the border, they
were ordered out and told to walk along the tracks into Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone told the same story. Some arrived by trucks and buses,
most of them from Pristina, others from Urosevac, or Ferizaj as the
Albanians know it, a town of some 70,000 people south of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   The flood into Macedonia, an estimated 90,000 refugees since
March 24, has completely overwhelmed the Macedonian authorities.
Soldiers were brought in to stem the flow along the railroad
tracks, and riot police armed with automatic weapons and wearing
flak jackets and helmets formed a barrier to block refugees from
the main road.
</P>
<P>
   NATO announced Friday that its soldiers would do whatever
possible to help with the influx of refugees into Macedonia and
look into what NATO could do to assist the U.N. High Commission for
Refugees in dealing with the crowds pouring in from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers admitted they had been taken by surprise by the
sudden rush of people in the last few days. ``We did not think such
a wave would arrive,'' said a Swiss representative of the Red
Cross, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   She estimated there were more than 10,000 refugees gathered, and
many more on the other side waiting to cross. NATO estimated the
number of people waiting to leave Kosovo on Friday at 25,000. And
one person who had driven to Macedonia estimated the line of
refugees waiting to get in by car was about five miles long. ``The
situation is getting dramatic, the Red Cross worker said. ``In one
or two days there will be people dying, the youngest and the
oldest.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one field hospital was working. Men struggled through the
crowd carrying an unconscious man into the tent, past a line of
women and babies. Old people sat on blankets outside.
</P>
<P>
   The police were enforcing strict controls to register the
refugees, but with only one table and one book, the line was barely
moving at the major border crossing. Refugees registering said they
had been lined up for seven hours, since before dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Families arriving collapsed where they stood, lying down in the
field among their few belongings, huddling under blankets and
plastic sheets as rain began to lash down. Some made wood fires,
others were trying to build shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Krasniqi was splicing a tree branch with a penknife, making
supports for a tent for his pair of tiny grandchildren asleep on
the ground. With his children, cousins, and elderly mother-in-law,
there were 15 people camped together on two square yards of earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would never have gone if they had not forced us,'' he said.
He and his wife, Fatima Krasniqi, said they did not blame NATO for
their plight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were happy that NATO bombs were falling; they were only
falling on military targets,'' she said. ``We were not afraid. We
even opened the windows to watch. If we did not have NATO, they
would have massacred all of us.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Syled Baftia, a man of 84, half blind and nearly deaf, sat tall
and defiant on the ground among his family. ``They are putting
children out in the rain,'' he said of the Serbs. His family fled
to Pristina after Serbian troops burned their village last year, he
said. Now they had been forced from Pristina at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing good will come of the Serbs after this. They forced us
out of our property,'' he said. ``Those are our lands, my family
has lived there for 500 years. But Belgrade will never own
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   For now though, his family had nowhere to go. ``We are sleeping
here on the ground, nine people to two blankets,'' his son, Tahir
Baftia, said. ``We cannot survive this, with all these people.
Europe has only four or five days to decide something.''
</P>
<P>
   Just behind the Baftia family, stumbling, eyes dazed with shock,
came the new arrivals along the train tracks. ``Ferizaj,'' they
said, mumbling the name of their home town as they walked, their
heads bent, exhaustion in their faces.
</P>
<P>
   A family bumped an old woman along in a wheelbarrow, another
dragged a young handicapped boy in a wheelchair. A young man
staggered as he heaved his grandfather onto his back to carry him.
</P>
<P>
   They described an exodus of extraordinary proportions from their
home towns. Naser Dubova and his family had spent the last 10 days
moving from house to house as the police cleared whole districts.
Finally the police and paramilitaries caught up with them and told
them to leave. ```Go anywhere, but leave,' they said'' Dubova
recounted. The family then tried for three days to find transport
out of the town.
</P>
<P>
   They slept at the train station in Urosevac, and then as more
and more people poured into the station amid rising panic, they
fought their way onto a convoy of buses that the Serbian
authorities organized to take them to the border. From there the
police ordered them to walk along the railroad tracks into
Macedonia, warning them that both sides of the tracks were mined.
</P>
<P>
   Farther up the track, a last group of exhausted refugees had sat
down to rest. ``Are there police further along? Are they separating
the men from the women?'' they asked. They were already in
Macedonia, but were clearly terrified their ordeal would continue.
</P>
<P>
   Few refugees recounted stories of killings, although several
said they had seen two or three bodies lying beside the train
tracks on the journey. Most families seemed to have escaped
together, men, women and children, unharmed if traumatized.
</P>
<P>
   At mid-afternoon a train carrying six cars disgorged thousands
more refugees from Pristina into the field. They said there were
many more people still in Pristina waiting at the station for
transport out.

PLIGHT OF REFUGEES CONCENTRATED AT BORDER CROSSINGS

<P>
   BLACE, Macedonia _ When Hilman Gashi's aunt collapsed, partially
paralyzed, after an apparent stroke Friday, he put her in a
wheelbarrow and set off down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where to go, I don't know what to do,'' Gashi
said, as his dazed 63-year-old aunt, Fatima Bejrisa, sat squished
into the wheelbarrow, weakly holding the hand of her husband, who
trudged along on the side.
</P>
<P>
   Gashi's frustration and desperation captured the scene here at
the Kosovo border, where up to 30,000 people sat or stood aimlessly
in a huge field in an open valley, waiting to enter Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers and police held them back, occasionally clashing with
refugees who were not allowed to leave the valley even when a
relative or friend from Macedonia showed up to vouch for them.
</P>
<P>
   Humanitarian groups acknowledge that the plight of refugees has
become a crisis, with too many people and too little help for them.
If the crunch earlier in the week was in Albania, it has now
shifted to a country that is less willing to take in the surge of
ethnic Albanians fleeing Serb forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is chaos,'' said Karen Robbins, a field coordinator for
Care International. ``One person is collapsing in that field every
two minutes, but there are not enough local doctors. There's panic.
Every time food is brought into the field, there's a rush and a
riot.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard by the Lepenec River, the exhausted, traumatized refugees
wait, sometimes for days, to get through. They sleep in the cold
open air, surviving on loaves of bread and water, though many say
they have gone days without food. The conditions are unsanitary and
people have no dignity, forced to urinate and defecate where they
can. The stench is growing by the hour, and aid workers are worried
about disease.
</P>
<P>
   There is a sea of people here, a sea of misery.
</P>
<P>
   A man sat with his wife and seven children, all of them weeping.
The man said his father had died as they waited at the border the
last two days. They had no way to bury him, so they left the body
behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``What could I do?'' the man wailed. ``What could I do?''
</P>
<P>
   One father pointed helplessly to the bloody feet of his
3-year-old daughter. He said Serb police had ordered his family to
leave immediately or be killed, and in the confusion they had left
without her shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Another old woman was brought in by wheelbarrow, unconscious,
swathed in blankets, her face the shade of alabaster.
</P>
<P>
   Nain Berisa said he and his wife, their three children and his
68-yearold mother-in-law left Pristina, the Kosovo capital, on
Tuesday, as Serb forces went house to house in an apparent effort
to expel all ethnic Albanians. It took them four days to make the
60-mile trek. The last few miles took two days to travel, so
clogged were the roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent one day in the field, one day in General Jancovic,''
he said, referring the last town in Kosovo before the border. ``We
have had nothing to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   After finally getting out of the field, Berisa and his family
were humiliated by an angry Macedonian police officer who blocked
their way and screamed at them to turn back and board a bus to a
refugee center in Skopje, the Macedonian capital.
</P>
<P>
   The police officer's rudeness was telling. Macedonians are
frightened that the flood of refugees will destabilize their
country, which can barely look after its own 2 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Ghedini, a spokeswoman for the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees, said 90,000 refugees had entered the
country since the NATO bombing began, some 60,000 in the last two
days, and most came through the hellish holding center at Blace.
</P>
<P>
   The only bright spot, Ghedini said, was that it did not appear
that men had been separated from women and girls. Such separations
were common last week when Serb forces cleared out the western
Kosovo city of Pec, and sometimes have led to summary executions of
men accused by the Serbs of being members or potential members of
the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Ghedini said tens of thousands of people are still waiting to
get into Macedonia, a backup that was being exacerbated by the
Yugoslav government, which is using a train to haul refugees from
Pristina to the field at Blace. Some put the number waiting to get
into Macedonia at 200,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is we have no advance warning when another train
is going to bring in another load of people,'' said Ghedini.
</P>
<P>
   She said her agency had distributed 47,000 blankets, 40 metric
tons of food, and 26,000 loaves of bread to refugees sleeping in
the open over the last two days. But the distribution of aid is
uneven and often chaotic.
</P>
<P>
   Many refugees said they had not been able to get anything to eat
or drink for days. Among those who said they went hungry were
Afroditi Rexha and her 13-year-old sister Albina.
</P>
<P>
   It took the two sisters from Pristina five days to get over the
border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We left my mother and father and brother behind in Pristina,''
said Afroditi, 25, a fourth-year medical student. ``Maybe they are
here. I can't find them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rexha sisters fled with only the clothes on their backs.
Unlike many others, they know no one in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what we will do,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on humanitarian groups is enormous. Jo Hegenauer,
the mild-mannered head of the UN refugees agency in Kosovo, kicked
the iron gate of his office's compound in frustrated rage Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Jo Hutton of Care International said aid workers are holding
round-the-clock meetings, trying to get more help to the refugees,
especially those cooped up in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to try megaphones, to try to get some
information to the people. That seems to be causing the panic.
People don't know why they're being held up in the field, what's
going to happen to them.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amit Chaudhuri is homesick, and so he is returning to India.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhuri, 36, author of the recently published and highly
praised ``Freedom Song,'' a collection of three short novels,
arrived in England in 1983 as a student. He will be going back to
Calcutta, his birthplace and the ``city of dust'' of his fictions,
as an award-winning novelist, one The London Review of Books has
said writes ``better than just about anyone of his generation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just miss things,'' Chaudhuri said on the telephone from his
home in Cambridge, England, where he is Leverhulme Fellow in
English at Cambridge University and unofficial writer in residence
at St. John's College at the university. ``It's something quite
physical. I miss the street life, the street noises, the light. The
fact that windows remain open and you can hear sounds coming from
inside. It's a part of my subconscious. Calcutta is depleted in
many ways _ there's a large outflow of the middle class to America
_ and it can exasperate and disillusion me. But the spell is still
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhuri's collection _ his first book published in the United
States _ is part of a resurgence of Indian writing in recent years.
Arundhati Roy's ``God of Small Things'' spent more than 30 weeks on
the hard-cover fiction best-seller list of The New York Times in
1997 and 1998. ``Hullaballoo in the Guava Orchard,'' a first novel
by Kiran Desai, won critical praise last year. New novels by Salman
Rushdie (``The Ground Beneath Her Feet'') and Hanif Kureishi
(``Intimacy'') are being published this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Michiko Kakutani, writing in The Times, called Chaudhuri's work
``wonderfully observed'' and said he was a ``gifted young writer
who has created an indelible portrait of India'' while ``leaving us
with a Proustian tapestry of quotidian moments recaptured and
remade as they loom large and astonishing in his characters'
minds.''
</P>
<P>
   In the three short novels, nothing much happens. In the first,
``A Strange and Sublime Address,'' which won first prize in the
1991 Betty Trask Awards in England as well as the Commonwealth
Writers Prize, a young boy from Bombay visits his aunt and uncle in
Calcutta; in the second, ``Afternoon Raag,'' which won two other
prizes, an Oxford University student copes with two unhappy
romantic relationships and recalls his days in India. In the third,
``Freedom Song,'' published by Alfred A. Knopf, two families deal
with life in Calcutta amid the city's Hindu-Muslim strife.
</P>
<P>
   The writing, Ms. Kakutani said, may seem casual, even artless,
but there is a hidden subtlety. His ``long, beautifully crafted
sentences,'' The London Review of Books said, ``give the impression
of being worked on for hours for no other purpose than to do
justice to the messy spontaneity of real life.''
</P>
<P>
   For Chaudhuri, it is that messy spontaneity, the irrelevances
and digressions that make up human existence, that primarily
interests him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the incidentals, the unexpectedness in everyday life,
the things the mind notes down not quite consciously,'' he said.
``In the life we lead, where we suffer and procreate and are happy
and have fun and are disappointed, the world outside is interwoven,
with us almost not having noticed it. You can be in a taxi and
you're on the way to the hospital because someone is dying, and
there's the smell of the taxi's interior and an old car horn or the
fact that you're passing a bank where you withdraw cash. The poetry
of the everyday is important, because it is so idiosyncratic. It
goes unconsciously into the making of our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to his long, flowing sentences, he said, they are
the product of both reworking and time. ``It's not scratching them
out and writing them again,'' he said. ``It's the time I need to
distance myself. I can't pound out 500 or 700 words a day. I don't
know how writers do that. It's enviable. But often the changes are
deletions rather than adornments. The deletions allow the
sentences, the paragraphs, the story, to breathe life, to emerge
into their true shape. I delete the words that are hiding them,
covering them.''
</P>
<P>
   What he aims for, he said, is a portrait of people. ``India is
vast, and different parts have different problems,'' he said. ``In
Bombay it is excessive capitalism, Hindu fundamentalism and
right-wing politics. In Calcutta it's the opposite. Instead of
trying to attract investment in a global age it sometimes seems to
discourage it. Its problem is stagnation.''
</P>
<P>
   What attracts him, he said, is life amid change. ``Whether they
like it or not, whether they know it or not, the people are part of
a time in history,'' he said. ``They are making small movements in
their lives while being caught up in a larger current.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhuri was born in Calcutta in 1962 and raised in Bombay,
where his father, now retired, was a business executive. He made
frequent visits to relatives in Calcutta _ as does Sandeep, the
10-year-old at the heart of ``A Strange and Sublime Address.''
</P>
<P>
   From an early age, he said, he wanted to be a writer. ``I
wouldn't call it a profound desire,'' he said. ``I didn't have
anything I wanted to write about. V.S. Naipaul talks about wanting
to be a writer long before he had anything to write about. It's the
romance of writing. It got to me quite early.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhuri graduated from University College in London and
received his doctorate at Balliol College at Oxford University, the
setting of ``Afternoon Raag.'' He has also been Creative Arts
Fellow at Wolfson College at Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   His parents and other family members now live in Calcutta, he
said, providing another reason for his need to return. ``I'm quite
close to my parents,'' he said. ``I'm their only child. I also sing
_ I'm a north Indian classical singer _ and to keep in touch with
that I need to go back often. And my wife and I have an 8-month-old
daughter, and we want her to grow up in India.''
</P>
<P>
   His fellowship ends on Monday, and he decided not to apply for
another. He has in the last 15 years spent several months a year
back home, but England was always his base. Now his home will be in
India, with perhaps two or three months a year in England. ``It's
an experiment,'' he said. ``I'm going to write full time, which
will also give me time for my music.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, there is something else behind his decision. ``I
have met with nothing but kindness and generosity here and I feel
great warmth for the people,'' he said. ``But I'm a foreigner.
They're trying to make it a multiracial society, and on some levels
it works. But every time I have to enter immigration at Heathrow
Airport and show my visa and get asked questions, it's not a
particularly pleasant experience. It makes me realize that at some
level this is not where I belong.''
</P>
<P>
   His writing has been compared to Proust, but Chaudhuri says the
influences lie elsewhere, and are perhaps more related to his sense
of not really belonging in his adopted society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Proust could have filtered through from other writers,''
he said. ``I think more of Elizabeth Bowen and Katherine Mansfield.
I don't know if they were transformed by reading Proust, but they
too seem to deal with language and memory. It is more that they are
at a slight angle. Bowen is Irish and Mansfield is from New
Zealand.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused. ``Maybe that's what appeals to me,'' he said. ``Since
I myself am at a slight angle.''

WALLENBERGS RESTRUCTURE AS GLOBAL ECONOMY ENCROACHES ON THEIR
INTERESTS

 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden _ Since the mid-19th century, Swedish industry
has been synonymous with the Wallenberg family. The dynasty's
interests reach everywhere, from heavy trucks and mobile phones at
home to construction sites in Asia and board rooms in the United
States. As one measure of the Wallenbergs' power in Sweden, their
holding company, Investor AB, controls companies that account for
an estimated 40 percent of shares traded on the Stockholm stock
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   But like Sweden itself, the Wallenberg business empire is under
siege these days by the forces of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were suddenly subject to all the competitive powers in the
world,'' said Jacob Wallenberg, 43, the chairman of Investor's SEB
Bank, who, along with his cousin Marcus Wallenberg, also 43,
represents the family's newest generation of top managers.
</P>
<P>
   In an unyielding global economy of free-flowing money,
international megamergers and an intense focus on ``core
competencies'' and shareholder value, the Wallenberg family
conglomerate, with its disparate and farflung interests, has been
looking increasingly like an anachronism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investor's traditional strategy _ as a long-term dominant and
active owner across a range of sectors based on a slowly changing
or unchanging portfolio _ is untenable,'' wrote Sweden's leading
weekly business magazine, Affarsvarlden.
</P>
<P>
   But the Wallenbergs hardly are sitting idle while the economic
ground shifts under their feet. Rather, they are restructuring key
parts of their empire, particularly in forestry and
pharmaceuticals, to make it more international, all in an effort to
improve returns. In a change from tradition, the family business is
being run by a nonfamily member, Percy N. Barnevik.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the family patriarch, Peter Wallenberg, stepped down as
chairman of Investor AB, though not as head of a Wallenberg family
foundation that controls 35.6 percent of Investor's voting rights.
The top jobs of chairman and chief executive of Investor went to
Barnevik, 58, and Claes Dahlback, 52. In February, the company said
that Dahlback, who has been the Wallenberg family's top nonfamily
manager for years, would retire in April and be replaced by Marcus
Wallenberg as chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Wallenberg's departure opened the way for the beginnings
of a rapid transformation under Barnevik, who made a name for
himself with the success of the 1987 Swedish-Swiss merger that
created ABB Asea Brown Boveri. Barnevik, who remains chairman of
ABB but is no longer chief executive there, seemed perfect for the
job of running Investor. Indeed, ABB, the engineering behemoth
based in Zurich, was acclaimed as one of the world's first truly
borderless companies.
</P>
<P>
   In his short period at the helm of Investor, Barnevik has
instilled tighter corporate governance in clubby Sweden and
loosened the Wallenbergs' grip on Swedish industry.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Wallenbergs had solidified their power at many
Swedish companies not so much by acquiring majority equity stakes
but by creating special voting rights for themselves that, in some
cases, were as much as 1,000 times their actual holdings.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more players in the capital market would say that
peculiar capital structures make for peculiar decisions,'' Jacob
Wallenberg said in an interview here.
</P>
<P>
   At some companies, Investor reduced its voting-power advantage
to ten-fold, a more defensible level that nonetheless left the
Wallenbergs in effective control even with a minority interest. The
balance between stock and voting rights is a tricky one. Without
the voting power to dominate management teams, the holding company
finds its ability to run the companies in its portfolio greatly
diminished. Investor's low equity stakes mean, though, that the
company does not necessarily benefit as much from successful
investments.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, with dizzying speed over the past two years, Investor
has made deals in forestry, pharmaceuticals and aerospace that
produced waves far beyond Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Zeneca Group PLC of Britain announced a $34.6
billion stock-only agreement to acquire Investor's Astra AB to
create a pharmaceutical powerhouse with its corporate headquarters
in London, its research and development unit in Sweden and Barnevik
as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Investor's Saab Aircraft sold a 35 percent stake in its
aerospace division to British Aerospace PLC for $454 million. Saab
also announced plans to close a civilian regional aircraft unit at
the end of this year. Late last year, Stora AB, Investor's forest
products group, announced a $6.9 billion merger with its Finnish
rival, Enso Oy, to produce a giant based in Helsinki, not
Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   Those deals were intended to give the company a competitive edge
in increasingly global businesses. Investor insiders say the wave
of restructuring is far from over. At the same time, Investor's
ramparts no longer seem as immune to assault as they once did.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Volvo AB _ which is not a Wallenberg company but is
run by a former Wallenberg manager, Leif Johansson _ bought a 12.85
percent chunk of stock in Scania AB, the Wallenberg-controlled
truck company. Such a challenge to the Wallenbergs, once
unthinkable, could only have been undertaken with the help of key
institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   But the once improbable has become commonplace all across the
corporate landscape as the barriers that once kept Swedish
businesses in Swedish hands crumble. For most of the century,
entrepreneurs have ventured out from Stockholm in search of
profitable opportunities to enhance their sheltered home base. That
business energy enabled Sweden to become one of the world's richest
countries and to afford a costly cradle-to-grave social safety net.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the trend has been reversed. Sweden's per capita income has
plummeted to No. 17 in the world from No. 3 over the past two
decades, and its welfare state cocoon has unraveled under assault
from outside forces and internal stresses. Corporate executives and
college graduates have been seeking jobs in Britain and the United
States, fleeing in record numbers from Sweden's punishing personal
tax rates, which go up to 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ericsson, the Swedish mobile-phone maker that is under severe
competitive pressure from Nokia of Finland, has joined the exodus.
A big element of the Investor portfolio, Ericsson will move its
European headquarters and corporate finance department to London in
August. There, the argument runs, executives prefer to pay lower
taxes and live in closer proximity to Europe's biggest capital
markets.
</P>
<P>
   As Ericsson departs, corporate giants from elsewhere are moving
in, underscoring Sweden's grudging absorption into the nearly
universal capitalist world order. Ford Motor Co. bought the car
division of Volvo, the quintessential emblem of Swedishness, for
$6.5 billion in January. General Motors Corp., which acquired a 50
percent stake in Saab Automobile AB from Investor in 1990, is
widely expected to acquire the other half soon.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the very breadth of Investor's holdings underpinned
the Wallenbergs' dominance in Swedish business. But as it confronts
pressure for restructuring, its stake in the companies in its
stable, and thus its control of them, stands to be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the structure of the family fortune, which is held in
a tax-exempt trust, leaves Investor few options but to shed its
equity stake in some companies in order to concentrate on those it
regards as essential businesses, Swedish analysts say. Its further
challenge will be to catch the wave of new, high-technology
businesses that younger Swedes see as the future.
</P>
<P>
   Barnevik, once viewed as a corporate magician, now faces
unaccustomed criticism from Swedish commentators questioning his
touch ever since Investor took a big hit from the economic tailspin
in Asia and Russia last year. (Investor shares closed on Thursday
in Stockholm at 362 kroner, or $43.93, down from a high of 479.5
kroner, or $58.19, last July 2.)
</P>
<P>
   The erosion of the Wallenberg empire has led to speculation that
other Investor interests _ including parts of its original
19th-century base, SEB Bank _ may be on the block. ``It is
increasingly difficult to play the part of an active owner once
control of commercial enterprises is diluted,'' Dahlback,
Investor's outgoing chief executive, told Affarsvarlden earlier
this year. ``And if we cannot perform as active owners, we would
prefer to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Others argue that the future of the Wallenberg dynasty depends
on a broader alchemy that permits Investor to exercise control
through the appointment of key managers and directors and draws on
the readiness of institutional investors to follow the holding
company's lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a numbers game,'' Barnevik, the company
chairman, said. ``It's a game of confidence from the institutions
that you are a good owner whether you own X percent or two times X
percent. It's a question of how well you do the job.''

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ For more than a week now, NATO civilian and
military spokesmen here have been giving daily briefings to
journalists from around the world. But these briefings are very
different from those that journalists got in Vietnam, the Persian
Gulf or Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO briefing officers tell almost nothing about what allied
warplanes are doing in Kosovo. Cloud cover and lack of an allied
presence on the ground has prevented them from obtaining precise
information, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, what the spokesmen have been putting out is reams of
reports, often in polemical terms, about what the Yugoslav forces
have been doing to Albanian civilians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with some of the tens of thousands of refugees
streaming from the province have largely corroborated the
alliance's claim that they are fleeing Serbian thugs and brutal
police and army attacks, not NATO bombing. But spokesmen for the
command have also been churning out anti-Yugoslav polemics and
sometimes even rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Credibility in military news briefings is everything, and the
lack of it in the early days of the Vietnam war was one reason why
the American public soured against involvement.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of providing details on allied bombing missions,
spokesmen for the alliance here have been issuing heated daily
denunciations of the Yugoslav anti-Albanian campaign in Kosovo, a
campaign that the allied military command itself acknowledges the
bombing has so far been unable to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing the best we can,'' said the alliance's spokesman,
Jamie Shea of Britain, a gregarious European security specialist
with a Oxford doctorate in modern history who is normally a fount
of expert information on everything the alliance is doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Operationally, it's sometimes difficult to get all of the
accurate information we need,'' he explained. ``We're aware of
this, and will do our best to increase the amount of information we
are able to give out.''
</P>
<P>
   But privately, civilians here at headquarters say their pleas to
the military for a more open policy have gone unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   And military officers here and in the field say that the
decision to provide as few operational details as possible is on
direct orders from the top allied commander, Gen. Wesley Clark of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It was also Clark, other officials say, who authorized a
military spokesman, a spit-and-polish British air commodore named
David Wilby, to tell journalists on March 29 that ``reliable
sources'' had reported that professor Fehmi Agami had been
``executed'' in Kosovo along with four other prominent ethnic
Albanian leaders. Agami was a member of the Kosovo Albanian
delegation to the peace talks in France.
</P>
<P>
   Wilby was careful to qualify the report, and did not claim that
the alliance had any independent confirmation of the charge.
</P>
<P>
   But within a couple of days, other sources in Kosovo said Agami
was safe, as was Baton Haxhiv, another prominent Albanian
opposition politician in Kosovo whose death the commodore had
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Though nobody here knows for sure even now where the men are,
the episode did little for Wilby's credibility, or for that of the
alliance.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since there is not much he or Shea has been able to say so far
about the details of the air campaign, they speak in generalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our adapted and responsible air campaign continues,'' the
commodore said Friday. ``Numerous infrastructure targets, including
bridges, were struck as well as several staging areas and
headquarters facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Maps and slides are equally vague. Clark, who briefed
journalists himself on Thursday, said the previous day's bombing
had hit Yugoslav army and Interior Ministry police forces in
Kosovo, and operational headquarters and support facilities
elsewhere in Serbia, but he did not identify any and gave no clue
about how many planes had flown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will tell you that the weather conditions haven't been
everything we sought,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The military is always concerned about giving information that
could compromise the safety of pilots who have to brave
sophisticated anti-aircraft defenses, which may explain the
reluctance to reveal operational details.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my profession, you don't expect an invitation, and you
don't expect to send a calling card to say you're coming,'' as
Wilby, a Royal Air Force navigator, put it.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, asked why he had released hardly any information about
targets in the first days of the bombing, though the Yugoslav
forces who had been bombed presumably knew who they were, suggested
that he was inhibited by the diversity of the Brussels press corps.
Among the reporters who come daily for information are
representatives of two Serbian daily newspapers and a Serbian news
agency.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, this is as amazing. It is as if Iraqi journalists had
been allowed into the allies' briefings in Saudi Arabia on the war
in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   But one result is that anybody who wants to find out what the
allies have been doing, as opposed to what the allies think about
what the Yugoslavs have been doing, has to look elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, for example, it was a British military official in
London, Air Marshal Sir John Day, who disclosed that American B-1
bombers had been active on Thursday night for the first time. All
Wilby would say about that was, ``We are increasing the tempo and
effectiveness of our campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark's close-mouthed policy means that he has effectively
surrendered control over public information about the allied
campaign to the British Defense Ministry and the Pentagon in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's bow-tied spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, is somewhat
more informative than Wilby has been, and because of the time
difference between Europe and the United States, Bacon often gives
the first details about operations that have not even begun by the
opening of the daily 3 p.m. briefing here.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's military subordinates in the field say they would love
to talk more about their exploits, but that they can't. So his
spokesmen, and the news organizations that depend on them for
information, rely instead on polemics and generalities.

KRAVIS TO SELL $1.5 BILLION IN GILLETTE STOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Gillette Co. director Henry R. Kravis is preparing to
cash out _ again _ following the company's acqusition of battery
maker Duracell International Inc. 2 1/2 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette said Friday that units of Kravis' New York buyout firm,
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co. have registered with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission to sell 25.6 million shares of
common stock.
</P>
<P>
   That stake would be worth $1.52 billion at Gillette's closing
price of 59 1/4 on Thursday, the most recent day markets were open.
Following the sale, KKR's stake in Gillette will decline to 2
percent of the company's 1.1 billion shares outstanding, from 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The sale marks the second time that KKR has benefited from
Gillette's purchase of Duracell, the Bethel, Conn. battery maker in
September 1996. KKR originally purchased Duracell from Kraft Inc in
1988 for $1.8 billion, and in 1991,, took the company public.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, KKR's remaining stake in the firm was translated
into shares of Gillette. In early 1998, KKR earned $1.01 billion
after selling 10 million Gillette shares at $101 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. will underwrite the current offering,
Gillette said. The registration statement is needed to sell shares
to the public because Kravis remains on Gillette's board of
directors.

BANKBOSTON OUTLINES SEVERANCE TERMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Seeking to temper the pain of impending layoffs,
BankBoston Corp. Friday outlined measures designed to aid employees
who will lose their jobs when the company merges with Fleet
Financial Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston, sensitive to its image among employees and the
community, said the severance terms it had created provided ``the
needed level of support for eligible employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleet and BankBoston expect to lay off a total of 4,000 to 5,000
employees across New England as they combine to form the nation's
eighth-largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand more staff members from both banks will find
themselves working for new companies when branches are sold later
this year to satisfy antitrust regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Under BankBoston's plan, employees who lose their jobs will
receive two weeks' base pay for each year of service.
</P>
<P>
   Additional supplements include 10 weeks' pay for those earning
less than $50,000 a year; 20 weeks' pay for those earning $50,000
to $100,000 annually; and 30 weeks' pay for those earning more than
$100,000 a year. Staff members will also receive payments ranging
from 4.3 to 8.7 weeks' salary.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston employs approximately 25,000 people, while Fleet has
about 35,000 workers. The banks expect to close a total of two
dozen branches, in addition to selling off, or divesting, around
270 branches throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet has been criticized in the past for an aggressive layoffs
program following mergers. But the company said Friday that
severance terms for its own employees, to be announced at the
beginning of next week, would be similar to BankBoston's.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston also said staff members will get continued medical
and life insurance for a limited period of time. The company said
it would provide outplacement services, external job retraining, as
well as support for staffers seeking internships, stipends for
those interested in community service or nonprofit organizations,
and aid to budding entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   The plans do not cover staffers at BancBoston Robertson
Stephens, the company's San Francisco investment bank. Those
employees are covered under their own firm's plan. BankBoston's
severance plans also exclude part-time workers.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston won praise for its severance package terms when it
cut 2,000 jobs after acquiring BayBanks Inc. in 1996. It said the
plans announced Friday are similar to the BayBanks program.

HOPSCOTCHING AT 10,000, THE DOW GETS OUR ATTENTION

<P>
   It was easy to dismiss the Dow's close above 10,000 last Monday
as merely symbolic, just one more market milestone _ and a not very
enduring one at that, given the index's fall later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   But for many investors, the barrier-breaking close was a time to
reconsider their relationship with stocks. One thing was clear from
conversations with investors around America: The market these days
is on almost everyone's mind.
</P>
<P>
   NEVADA: Dave Franchi never used to spend much time thinking
about the stock market. A self-employed carpenter in Sparks, Nev.,
Franchi, 43, told his bank to deduct $525 a month from his checking
account to invest in some mutual funds recommended by a financial
planner, and left it at that. The money is meant to pay for college
for his two teen-aged sons and for his own retirement.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Dow breaking the 10,000 mark, he is becoming
captivated. He has shifted his IRA to an investment that has
``higher risk but greater profit potential, since it's so bullish
right now.'' He is even thinking of taking a few thousand dollars
to ``dabble online.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a good feeling right now,'' Franchi said. ``Whether it
will last very long, you never know.'' But his home-repair business
is thriving, so Franchi feels flush, and the long bull market has
raised his expectations. ``If I could do 18 to 25 percent this
year, I'd probably be pretty happy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ By JON CHRISTENSEN
</P>
<P>
   MASSACHUSETTS: Kristin Todd yawned at the Dow's breaking 10,000:
``They'd been hyping it for so long, it was like, `Oh, it finally
happened.' It was a little bit anticlimactic.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Todd, 34, a Boston public relations executive, and her
husband have been investing in individual stocks and mutual funds
for two years without relying on professional advice. Most of her
friends invest the same way. ``Maybe 10 years ago, you used to call
your stock broker, but now you're calling your friends, you
colleagues, and asking them for some financial advice.''
</P>
<P>
   She and two lunch companions agreed that the Internet had made
investing in stocks easy and fun, and though she knows there are
risks, she can't picture doing anything else with whatever spare
cash comes her way, including this year's tax refund. ``You trust
the stock market a little bit more,'' she said ``so you choose that
over something else.''
</P>
<P>
   _ By DAVE SHAW
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: Charlotte Kennedy, 43, a Houston bookstore employee,
remains fatalistic about the market no matter what milestones the
Dow hits. ``Ten thousand? So what? It goes up, and it goes down,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   After her mother died two years ago, Ms. Kennedy turned over
half of her inheritance to a broker to invest. ``People like me do
it because we heard it's how the other half lives,'' she said. ``I
don't look at what it's doing; I wouldn't even know how.''
</P>
<P>
   If the market tanked, she said, ``I'd be concerned but not
devastated. The way I see it, it isn't money I earned with my own
hands; I inherited it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ By KATE MURPHY
</P>
<P>
   MASSACHUSETTS: The market has Mark Caudill, 32, a violinist in
Somerville, Mass., uneasy. He has stopped putting new 401(k)
contributions into stocks because he thinks the market is in a
bubble and investors are losing touch with reality: ``My dad's
obsessed. Every night he watches the `Nightly Business Report' and
gauges his moods on how the market is doing. It's ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is peer pressure, Caudill said: ``People
feel like they missed the boat in the '80s, when anybody who had
any money made a lot. Now they want in.''
</P>
<P>
   It's only a matter of time, he thinks, before economic trouble
overseas bursts the bubble. ``As soon as all the rich people start
to feel the tremors, they'll pull their money out and take the rest
of us with them,'' he said. ``Everyone else rides along on their
coattails when it's good, and we really suffer when it's bad.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: When she heard about the Dow hitting 10,000, Elizabeth
Getteau's reaction was, ``OK, next.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of her savings are in her 401(k), 75 percent of which is
invested in stocks. Ms. Getteau, 28, also has ``a bunch'' of shares
in Continental Airlines, where she works as an accountant in its
Houston headquarters, and stakes in IBM, Walt Disney and Merck that
she inherited.
</P>
<P>
   ``My generation has no fear,'' she said. ``It's always gone
up.'' So last week, she organized an investing club consisting of
herself, her mother and her aunts, whose caution will
counterbalance her enthusiasm for risk.
</P>
<P>
   Though she thinks the Dow will level off for a while, she said,
``All of my tax refund is going to buy stock.''
</P>
<P>
   _ By KATE MURPHY
</P>
<P>
   MASSACHUSETTS: George Herrmann, 42, a telephone company systems
analyst in Boston, was skeptical of the Dow's short-term staying
power: ``I actually think it's just a surge. Breaking 10,000
generated a lot of interest and that interest turned into impact. I
don't think it's going to stay there.''
</P>
<P>
   But he feels sure that technology stocks will lift the market to
new heights again before long, so he's leaving his 401(k) as is,
mainly in technology stocks and funds. ``As long as you're dealing
with technology, there is no limit,'' he said. ``If a company still
has fresh ideas, it's a sound investment.''
</P>

<P>
   ILLINOIS: Camilla Ashley, 56, a psychiatrist in Oak Park, Ill.,
a Chicago suburb, saw echoes of human nature in the hubbub over Dow
10,000. ``It's just a nice number,'' she said. ``People get
fascinated with the millennium and other nice numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The milestone hasn't altered her portfolio _ mainly stock mutual
funds _ but she sees other people behaving differently. ``People
definitely feel these days like the stock market is something that
they have to be a part of. We make it an obligation for ourselves
to be earning as much as possible, and not only do people have to
earn money, but their money has to earn money. I think that's too
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ashley has stopped putting new money into stocks, mainly
because she needs cash to pay a child's tuition at medical school.
``I'm investing in daughter futures,'' she joked.

   BRITISH COLUMBIA: Lorraine Moncur, 66, of Victoria, British
Columbia, has done well enough with her retirement investments, all
in stocks and mutual funds, that she can afford to travel. On a bus
tour with her sister and cousin, she stopped at the Carson Nugget
Casino in Carson City, Nev., last week. But the same bull market
that pays for a bit of recreational gambling has made her less
inclined to gamble on stocks. Instead, she is gradually selling
when she needs cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do this for fun,'' she said, gesturing toward the
surrounding slot machines. ``This is pure speculation. And I don't
speculate on the market anymore. I used to, but it can be
disastrous _ as bad as this,'' she said, with another pull on the
handle. ``And our luck here hasn't been as good as the Dow.''

   NEVADA: Henry Wong, 41, keeps the TV above the bar in his
Chinese restaurant in Carson City tuned to financial news. He is an
active online trader in stocks and is more interested in how
volatile the market is than in how high the Dow rises.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamentals of the market are basically the same whether
it's at 9,900 or 10,000,'' he said, ``but you make more money when
it's going up and down if you're trading. I don't buy stocks and
hold them; if it goes up a couple of points, I sell, and then I
wait for it to come down and buy again. I miss a lot of the growth
sometimes, but I'm not greedy. And if you're not holding a lot of
stock when the market goes down, you're usually OK''

   CALIFORNIA: Katherine Kaplan can't escape following the market,
even though her own portfolio these days is all cash. Everyone else
in the family of this Los Angeles eighth grader seems to be fixated
on the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as she got home Monday, she heard about Dow 10,000 from
her mother _ who owns big industrials like Wrigley and Archer
Daniels Midland but avoids computer stocks. When Katherine tries to
watch MTV at her grandfather's house, she said, ``he walks in and
changes the channel on me, sits there for five minutes watching the
bottom of the screen roll by, shouts `Yes!' and hands me back the
control.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``He said he never thought he'd see 10,000, so he's
really happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Why are the grown-ups all stock-mad? ``Now that this weird
Monica Lewinsky stuff is over, people have turned off the talk
radio and are doing something more productive,'' she said. No
stocks for her, though: she's banking her allowance, hoping
eventually to buy a car.

   High Income, No Tax: A More Exclusive Club
</P>
<P>
   The number of Americans who made $200,000 or more, yet managed
to pay no federal income taxes, fell to 1,820 in 1996, down about
one-third from a peak of 2,675 in 1995, new IRS data show.
</P>
<P>
   An annual IRS report to Congress also showed that 36,759
taxpayers making $200,000 or more paid less than 15 percent of
their income in federal income taxes in 1996, the last year for
which data are available.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, the first year the report was issued, 85 taxpayers _
who can be married couples filing jointly or individuals _ paid no
income taxes despite making at least $200,000, the equivalent of
about $543,000 today.
</P>

   Slightly more than 1.5 million taxpayers had income of more than
$200,000 in 1996. That group is only 1.3 percent of all taxpayers,
but together they earned $806.6 billion, 17.8 percent of all
individual income reported to the IRS, and paid $228.1 million in
federal income tax, or 34.7 percent of individual income taxes that
year.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS report, in the winter 1998 Statistics of Income
Bulletin, did not specify how each of the 1,820 taxpayers avoided
federal income taxes in 1996, including the alternative minimum
tax, which was enacted in 1969 to thwart tax avoidance by the rich.
Many of those 1,820 filers, however, received significant income
from municipal bonds, which are generally tax-exempt. Also common
in their returns were unusually large medical and dental bills,
stakes in partnerships and corporations that pass tax liabilities
to their owners, and casualty or theft losses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And all but 160 in the group also escaped paying income taxes
anywhere in the world.

   Flocking to the IRS Site
</P>
<P>
   The IRS has been reaching out to taxpayers on the Internet since
1996, and this year, taxpayers are reaching back in record numbers.
From Jan. 1 through last Sunday, the IRS Web site was visited 573.6
million times, up from 231 million during the same period a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The site, called The Digital Daily, covers topics like
regulations, deadlines and electronic filing of tax returns
(www.irs.ustreas.gov/prod/cover.html). But the centerpieces of the
site are the forms and publications to download and use, said Jerry
Conway, the senior technology adviser for the Digital Daily.
</P>
<P>
   Conway said the family of 1040 forms is the most popular part of
the site, followed by publications about new provisions like
benefits for higher education and the child tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   Among new features in The Digital Daily are a W-4 form
calculator for figuring how much tax to have withheld from
paychecks, a section for owners of small businesses and an
education section that helps teachers orient students in grades 8
to 12 to the inevitability of taxes _ something for which many are
not prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``They work for three hours at $7 per hour and expect a check
for $21,'' Conway said. ``Taxes are a culture shock for them.''

   OK, You're Famous; Now Get Back to Work
</P>
<P>
   He was the toast of the international banking community. But
not, on this occasion at least, for his financial expertise.
Kenneth Lipper, chairman of Lipper &AMP; Co., which manages $5 billion
for pension funds and wealthy individuals, shared the Oscar last
month for best documentary feature for ``The Final Days.'' Lipper
was co-producer of the film, which is about Holocaust survivors.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Lipper joined 20 other bankers _ including
Walter Shipley, chairman of Chase Manhattan Corp.; Frank Newman,
chairman of Bankers Trust; Toshio Morikawa, chairman of the
Sumitomo Bank, and David Li, chairman of the Bank of East Asia _
for a meeting of the International Advisory Board of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York. As the dinner was under way in the bank's
banquet room, New York Fed president William McDonough raised his
glass to congratulate Lipper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had prime ministers and presidents and kings in this
room,'' McDonough declared, ``but we've never had the winner of an
Academy Award.''
</P>
<P>
   Lipper was just as delighted by the comment of a tablemate: ``Oh
yes, we watched you in Hong Kong.''
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean that Lipper, basking in his colleagues'
accolades, was momentarily distracted from the market? Not a bit.
``I talk with my office at least 10 times a day,'' he said. ``The
market keeps me grounded, reminding me of how fast things, and
people, can go up, and then come down.''
</P>
<P>
   An Online Reincarnation
</P>
<P>
   Dan Dorfman's ability to move stocks has long been well known.
As a financial journalist for USA Today, CNBC and Money magazine,
Dorfman over two decades often sent stocks soaring with predictions
of takeovers or other news _ some of which actually panned out.
</P>
<P>
   That was before the Internet became the preferred medium for
spreading stock tips and before day traders were such a potent
force. Now, after a hiatus, Dorfman plans to return to his trade by
linking with an Internet tip service known as Jagnotes.com.
</P>
<P>
   Dorfman was dismissed by Money magazine in 1996 amid reports
that securities regulators were investigating his relationship with
a stock promoter who later pleaded guilty to charges of securities
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Recchia, a spokesman for Dorfman, said last week that
``neither Dan nor his lawyer has ever been contacted by the
government seeking an interview'' about those matters.
</P>
<P>
   Dorfman suffered a stroke in May 1996. His contract with CNBC
expired, and he has since been largely inactive as a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Jagnotes started in 1989 as a fax service that compiled details
on equity research by major brokerage firms, but its $2,000 annual
fee was prohibitive for most individual investors. Jagnotes
recently went public by merging with a company that had publicly
traded stock but no operations and started a Web site offering
subscriptions for $9.95 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Dorfman will post a daily report on the site, and Gary Valinoti,
the chief executive, said he believes the service will be able to
charge ``Super Bowl rates'' to advertisers. A television deal for
Dorfman is also in the works, people close to the negotiations
said.
</P>
<P>
   For signing with Jagnotes, Dorfman has received long-term stock
options, Valinoti said. Dorfman's spokesman declined to elaborate
on Dorfman's compensation package. The share price of the company
soared from less than $1 to more than $20 the last two weeks, most
recently trading at $16.50. The move came before Dorfman's
employment was reported.

at New York City's Grand Central Terminal on Monday night followed
by a party to celebrate the NCAA men's basketball championship

two big sport utility vehicles, the Chevrolet Suburban and the GMC
Yukon, then sat down in front of a wide-screen television to cheer
for his alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   Duke, however, was upset by the University of Connecticut.

WAY CLEARED FOR PHILADELPHIA TO DEVELOP SHIPYARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Agreements signed this week by the U.S. Navy and
the city of Philadelphia have cleared the way for the city to
develop the huge shipyard that was shut down four years ago in a
round of military base closings.
</P>
<P>
   The city can now begin to market the former Philadelphia Naval
Shipyard as a commercial site, an endeavor that is expected to
result in up to 3,000 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The first major business interested in the shipyard, Kvaener ASA
of Norway, the largest shipbuilding company in Europe, agreed more
than a year ago to build there but needed title to its site by
April 2000 to proceed. The agreements, in effect, pass ownership of
the shipyard to the city, allowing it to sign contracts with
individual buyers and tenants.
</P>
<P>
   Kvaener, which is planning to lease 115 acres for about $345,000
a year for 99 years, could create 1,000 jobs or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very important milestone in a difficult process,''
said Julie Van Nostern, director of Philadelphia's Office of
Defense Conversion, an arm of the city's industrial development
agency. ``For economic development, it's very significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Opened in 1801, the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard operated as one
of the country's largest shipbuilding sites until it was included
among 26 military bases recommended to be closed in the aftermath
of the Cold War. Over the years, more than 100 ships were built
there, and thousands were repaired.
</P>
<P>
   In the peak years, from World War II through the mid-1980s, as
many as 12,000 people worked at the shipyard, but when it finally
closed, in September 1995, the workforce was down to 1,600. The
aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy was the last naval craft to be
overhauled there.
</P>
<P>
   Once the shipyard closed, city and state officials began
planning a development strategy, leading to a $429 million
commitment by the city, state and federal governments to upgrade
the site and offer job training programs.
</P>
<P>
   City officials negotiated with the Navy to obtain the rights to
the property, and on Wednesday officials signed three contracts
that passed control of 1,100 acres to the city for $2 million. The
Navy is retaining 130 acres for its own use.
</P>
<P>
   The agreements allow the city to sign long-term deals with
prospective tenants, some of whom will require major construction
projects to accommodate their businesses. Ms. Van Nostern said that
before the city's deal with the Navy was finalized, some
prospective tenants had been reluctant to sign leases with no
guarantees that the Navy would allow them to remain beyond a few
years.
</P>
<P>
   The site has two major components, the former shipbuilding yard,
which Kvaener will occupy, and a former naval station, which
officials hope to market as a gated, mixed-use site for commercial
and light industrial businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Major selling points, they said, are the property's location, a
suburban setting about halfway between downtown and Philadelphia
International Airport, and a light-rail line that runs onto the
site.
</P>
<P>
   Dee Kaplan, director of Mayor Edward Rendell's business action
team, said the city's agreement with the Navy ``gives us more
freedom and flexibility to deal with companies who want to buy or
lease'' at the former naval yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of companies have expressed interest,'' she said. ``We
also have a lot of existing companies in the area who love the
ambience of the place.''

KEY NATIONS IN MIDDLE EAST BACK NATO EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Although there have been vocal protests around
the world against the US-led NATO bombing campaign in Yugoslavia,
there has been a notable silence in the Arab world, which usually
opposes US military engagements.
</P>
<P>
   The support reflects Islamic solidarity with a fellow Muslim
people under siege in the Balkans. But it is tempered by the fact
that the three other recent American military operations have
targeted Muslim states: Iraq, Sudan, and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans are bombing under the banner of protecting
Muslims,'' said Abdel-Barri Atwan, editor of the London-based Arab
language newspaper Al Quds. ``It would not look very nice if the
Arab world was opposing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan made The most vocal expression of support for NATO. On
Wednesday, the new leader, King Abdullah, recalled his ambassador
to Belgrade in protest and joined other Arab nations in pledging
humanitarian assistance to the Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Gulf region, state-controlled newspapers appealed
to the United States and its NATO allies to commit ground troops to
stop Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the only way to save the Kosovo Albanians,'' according
to an editorial in the Saudi newspaper al-Madina. ``NATO cannot
back away.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in Afghanistan, where US cruise missiles rained down last
year in an attempt to disrupt the operations of Osama bin Laden,
the Saudi businessman believed to be behind the bombings of two US
embassies in Africa, the ruling Taliban party said the use of armed
force is justified in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But the Taliban chief representative in the United States, Abdul
Hakeem Mujahid, said in an interview that the NATO air campaign was
not enough to stop the Serb onslaught, and said Afghanistan would
support the use of Western ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the NATO powers to prevent Serb brutality and provide
protection to the Muslims,'' he said. But ``we are afraid they are
failing in their mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Muslim countries themselves have been sending food but little
military support to the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The United States put pressure on the Kosovo Liberation Army to
refuse help from Islamic ``freedom fighters,'' and Washington has
pressed the Kosovars' allies, including Albania, to deport Islamic
militants from as far away as Afghanistan who are offering aid to
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   But support for NATO action was far from universal in the Arab
world. President Mohammed Khatami of Iran criticized the NATO
airstrikes, voicing concern that it would spark even more violent
reaction by the Serbs. Still, he voiced little sympathy with
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Observers say the public reaction of Muslim governments masks
deep misgivings about the use of Western military force.
Abdel-Barri said many in the Arab world wonder whether the United
States will target Iraq or Libya next, or encourage Christian
secessionists in southern Sudan to establish their own state.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great deal of reservation but no outright
condemnation,'' said Clovis Maksoud, a professor of Middle East
Studies at American University. ``The pattern of Milosevic's
behavior shields NATO from condemnation.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Iraq and Libya, the Arab world's most bitter adversaries of
the United States, have sided with Milsoevic, but won little
backing.
</P>
<P>
   Moammar Khadafy of Libya appealed unsuccessfully to a number of
Muslim and African organizations, including the Arab League and the
Organization of African Unity, to condemn the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, British officials accused Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein of supplying Yugoslavia with air defense systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen some of these Iraqi tactics already put into
practice over Serbia,'' said Britain's military chief of state,
General Charles Guthrie.

RUSSIAN HACKERS INVADE NATO COMPUTERS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beavis and Butthead, the cackling cartoon characters, stare out
from a NASA Web page, their fists raised in a sort of virtual
protest. These familiar figures from American popular culture are
hardly the new image of the space agency: The site was hacked late
Friday by a group of Russian computer experts who also posted the
same message on a government Web site in Egypt. The hacked sites,
signed ``From Russia With Love,'' are scrawled with a profane
message denouncing NATO as well as a demand for allied troops to
``Go away from Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   While the real war in the Balkans wages on the ground and in the
air, another virtual war is being fought in cyberspace. In the past
few days, hackers on both sides of the conflict have been defacing
Web sites with electronic graffiti and launching programs designed
to slow down or crash their opponents' servers.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the NATO server in Belgium was bombarded with
thousands of e-mails coming from Yugoslav hackers that overloaded
its Web site. Another group called ``Russian Hackers Union''
defaced a US Navy site.
</P>
<P>
   Hacking groups in the United States and Europe are retaliating
with their own graffiti. A coalition that calls itself Team Spl0it,
which includes an 18-year old American hacker, broke into several
Web sites and posted such anti-war slogans as, ``Tell your
governments to stop the war.'' Hackers on the West Coast are trying
to crack the Serb government site, although the server is said be
extremely secure and based in London. And the Kosovo Hackers Group,
a coalition of European and Albanian hackers, has erased at least
five sites and replaced them with black and red ``Free Kosovo''
banners.
</P>
<P>
   In what is being called the first Internet war, hackers are
emerging as electronic vigilantes. At the same time that
governments are inundating the Internet with propaganda and
individuals are using the medium to communicate, hackers have
actually taken the battle into their own hands, performing military
exercises with the click of a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   It's called ``hacktivism,'' the marriage of computer hacking and
political activism. This form of protest has been around since
1995, when hackers became politicized to support convicted hacker
Kevin Mitnick. Most electronic civil disobedience is illegal in the
US, but this is the first time it has been employed during an
international conflict and there is no precedent that governs such
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Vatis, chief of the FBI's National Infrastructure
Protection Center, said through a spokesperson Friday that he had
no comment on the recent rage of hacktivism.
</P>
<P>
   In past international conflicts, governments have successfully
disrupted the telecommunications systems of their opponents. But in
the age of the Internet, this is the first time that private
citizens have been able to jump into the fray.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the harbinger of things to come,'' said Barry
Steinhardt, former president of the Electronic Frontier Foundation
and associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union.
``It's a free and open network. Parts of it are sealed off, but
it's a porous network. It's inevitable that you're going to get
vigilantes acting in an extralegal way.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackers have traditionally objected to attempts to curtail free
speech, and American hackers are outraged by Serb government
censorship. One member of Team Spl0it, an 18-year old resident of
the East Coast who goes by the handle f0bic said in an e-mail
message that he and others decided to take action a few weeks ago.
``I, along with the rest of my team, decided to get the message out
of the Internet,'' he wrote. ``Our message was bright and clear:
Stop the war before we go to World War III.'' The Globe has
confirmed his existence, but he asked that his real name not be
used.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not consider our actions as `war-like,' '' he continued.
``We are not destroying information on sites. We are just trying to
educate people on the real stories, and this seems to be the only
way you can get attention.'' The group hacked the site of the
Cambridge City Council in England as well as other sites.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the respected Electronic Frontier Foundation, a
leader in Internet policy, has contended that hacktivism is illegal
and can be neither encouraged nor condoned. But that may change in
an international conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may want to reevaluate that in light of the historical
importance that civil disobedience has played as a means of
protest,'' said Alex Foster, the foundation's director of public
affairs. ``Does hacktivism change in a crisis situation? I don't
have an answer on that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster warned that ordinary citizens who are using the Internet
to communicate their own political opinions legally should be
careful, though. ``People in Serbia who are using the the Internet
for normal things like sending e-mail may be putting themselves at
great risk,'' he said. In China, for instance, the government has
cracked down on dissidents simply for sending e-mail that
criticizes the regime.
</P>
<P>
   Hacktivists in Kosovo could be in danger, Foster said. But US
and Russian hacktivists continue their cyberwar unabated and
unconcerned about repercussions. ``We are activists because we see
there are wrongs that need to be corrected,'' f0bic wrote. ``It
seems hackers are the only ones out there actually trying to change
the situation.''

NUMBERS OF YOUNG ALBANIAN MEN LEAVING KOSOVO ON UPSWING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO issued perhaps its most panicked public
request Friday, with spokesman Jamie Shea demanding: ``Will the
authorities in Belgrade please tell us what has happened to the
Kosovo Albanian men between the ages of 16 and 60?''
</P>
<P>
   But by late afternoon, the mystery was not simply where the men
had gone. It was why, after days of reports about missing Albanian
men, they suddenly appeared to be streaming across the border from
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday night, in fact, the UN High Commissioner for Human
Rights was reporting a sudden influx of young male Kosovars into
Macedonia and Albania. Officials believe the men may either be
soldiers from the Kosovo Liberation Army fleeing Serb troops, or
young civilians who had been hiding in the mountains for the last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen, in the last 24 hours, a lot of young men coming
out. This does not account for all of them,'' said UNHCR spokesman
Panos Moumpzis. ``But it is large groups of men.''

   Reports about the whereabouts of fighting-age males had been
unsettling _ and dubious _ since NATO airstrikes began, and the
reappearance Friday of so many of the presumed dead raised broader
questions about the quality of the information NATO officials
receive and distribute to the world. Despite the confusion that
traditionally clouds accuracy in combat situations, several recent
incidents of conflicting accounts have reminded outsiders that even
NATO officials don't always know what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, NATO reported five ethnic Albanian leaders
had been executed by Serb forces, but days later other Western
sources indicated the two most prominent of the men were alive.
Reports that a soccer stadium in the Kosovo capital of Pristina had
been transformed into a concentration camp by Serb officials were
also called into question by numerous refugees. Even the tallies of
refugees has varied from agency to agency at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any time there's a military conflict, there's always a
`fog of war,' '' said David Leavy, a spokesman at the National
Security Council. ``You never get a full accounting until it's
over. But you can base a lot of judgments on anecdotal and
eyewitness accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   While no one is dismissing reports of scattered killings, the
stories of missing Albanians primarily have come from villagers who
described seeing their young sons separated by Serb troops _ and
could not be independently verified.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been seeing more families altogether coming out,'' said
James Foley, a spokesman for the State Department. ``That seems to
be a pattern. That's not necessarily a contradiction with earlier
reports.''

   When it comes to picking among the thousands of mutual funds out
there, investors want a rating system that separates the wheat from
the chaff. Unfortunately, the most popular rating services get only
half of the equation. They do a good job of pinpointing the chaff
of the investing arena, but are not much help in identifying the
wheat.
</P>
<P>
   Consider  &UR; Morningstar &LR; , the Chicago financial publisher that
provides the most widely used fund rating system. Morningstar ranks
funds on a scale of one to five stars, according to their
historical, risk-adjusted performance. While the ratings thus look
backward at performance, Morningstar advises that they be used as a
first tool _ though not the only one _ in selecting a fund. And
individual investors overwhelmingly choose four- or five-star funds
when investing.
</P>
<P>
   Funds in the bottom 10 percent of their universe receive one
star, while those in the top 10 percent receive five. When
calculating the stars, Morningstar ranks on the same curve all
funds in a particular universe, say domestic equity funds,
regardless of their investing style, their objective or their
holdings' market capitalizations.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while one-star funds significantly underperform the market,
five-star funds, on average, do not outperform it, according to a
recent study.
</P>
<P>
   Let's look first at the one-star funds. The study, by
Christopher R. Blake, associate professor of finance at Fordham
University's Graduate School of Business, and Matthew Morey,
assistant professor of economics at Fordham, found that those
funds, on average, trailed the market by a large margin. The
average fund that had a one-star rating on Jan. 1, 1993, lagged
behind the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index by 8.4 percentage
points a year for the five years ending Dec. 31, 1997. (That
five-year period was one of many studied, but the results are
representative of the professors' findings.)
</P>
<P>
   That performance difference is substantial, and Morningstar can
be proud that its one-star rating was so effective at identifying
such likely underperformers.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive as that may be from an academic viewpoint, it is of
limited real-world value in helping you outperform the market: All
you can do with Morningstar's list of one-star funds is avoid them.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, at the other end of the spectrum, Morningstar's
five-star funds, as a group, do not beat the market, even if they
clearly do better than the average one-star fund. For example, the
average fund with a five-star rating on Jan. 1, 1993,
underperformed the market by 3.8 percentage points for the five
years through Dec. 31, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not the only difficulty in the rankings. According
to Professors Blake and Morey, the differences between the
performances of the average five- , four- , and three-star funds
are so small as to have very little statistical significance.
</P>
<P>
   One of the other rating services monitored by the Hulbert
Financial Digest have done any better than Morningstar in
identifying funds that will outperform. For example, the  &UR; Value
Line Mutual Fund Survey &LR; , created several years ago to compete with
Morningstar, also bases its ranking on historical risk-adjusted
performance, though it looks at performance over different periods
than Morningstar does and defines risk differently. Yet, on
average, its group of highest-ranked equity funds have performed
more than one percentage point a year worse than Morningstar's.
</P>
<P>
   One of the fund-picking approaches that most profitably uses
past performance data is remarkably simple, involving no
complicated risk-adjustment or long-term historical comparisons.
This system calls for the purchase each Jan. 1 of the
best-performing diversified no-load equity fund of the previous
year. According to Sheldon Jacobs, editor of the  &UR; No-Load Fund
Investor &LR;  in Irvington, N.Y., such an approach would have produced
a 20.2 percent return, annualized, since the beginning of 1975,
beating the Wilshire 5000 by an average of 3.2 percentage points a
year and far outpacing any competing fund selection method I know.
</P>
<P>
   But there may be less here than meets the eye. For starters,
investing in last year's winners is risky. When the approach works,
it is because the stock market exhibits short-term momentum; one
year's wave often continues into the next year. But when that wave
crashes, sooner rather than later, the funds at its crest can
sometimes be the biggest casualties.
</P>
<P>
   One measure of the heightened risk comes from Mark Carhart,
formerly an assistant professor of finance and business economics
at the University of Southern California. Carhart, now co-head of
quantitative research at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, has
studied fund performance year to year back to 1962. If fund
performance were all a matter of luck, one would expect that just
10 percent of all funds in the top performing decile one year would
repeat that performance the next year. But Carhart has found that a
greater percentage of those top performers manage to do so. Here's
the catch: He has also found that the top decile performers in any
one year are more likely to end up the next year in the  &UR; bottom &LR;  10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, investing in last year's top performers is a
crap shoot. You might be lucky. But there also a significant chance
that you'll invest in a real clunker.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs began using the strategy in late 1991 and, though it is
not his only strategy, has been recommending it to subscribers ever
since. Over the next seven years, his portfolio that uses the
strategy lagged behind the broad market by an average of 2.2
percentage points a year. Worse yet, it was also 31 percent more
volatile.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the popular rating systems is that they do a
poor job of distinguishing between adviser skill and mere luck. And
so it is no surprise that the top-rated funds do not meet
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Consider how funds have performed over the last five years, a
period dominated by large-capitalization stocks and by growth
investing instead of a value approach. A fund manager whose focus
over these years was small-cap value would probably look awful,
even if he outperformed the average small-cap value stock. By the
same token, the manager of a large-cap growth fund could still look
good, even if his fund has trailed the average large-cap growth
stock. The real measure of an adviser's skill is outperforming a
benchmark constructed to match all relevant aspects of his
approach.
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar is aware of this criticism and has taken some steps
toward addressing it. For example, it no longer compares
international equity funds with domestic equity funds when awarding
stars. But it still puts all domestic equity funds into the same
pot, regardless of whether they are large- or small-cap, value or
growth.
</P>
<P>
   How can investors identify which funds have truly outperformed
their peers, taking into consideration the different market caps or
investing styles? I know of no service that regularly provides such
rankings, even though several, including Morningstar and Value
Line, provide much of the data necessary to do so. In the meantime,
unless they're willing to just go with the roll of the dice,
investors should judge a fund's performance only by comparing it to
others that focus on the same kinds of securities and pursue a
similar investing style.

OPPOSITION TO ZEDILLO'S PRIVATIZATION PLAN WORRIES INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also MEXICO-UNREST, which in moving in the ``i'' category
code.) (DW) 
 By RICK WILLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ At a recent hearing on President Ernesto Zedillo's
proposal to privatize Mexico's electric power industry, government
workers who oppose the plan broke out singing Mexico's national
anthem.
</P>
<P>
   The music was off key, but the political grandstanding was
effective, embarrassing the initiative's supporters by cloaking
government ownership of Mexico's power plants and transmission
lines in patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   The incident underlined the struggle that Zedillo faces in
raising support for the privatization plan, which he says is
urgently needed to attract $25 billion in investments to modernize
and expand the country's power generation and distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Since the president announced the initiative in February,
powerful unions and opposition party legislators have expressed
disapproval as have some members of his own Institutional
Revolutionary Party.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the two main opposition parties, who together control
the lower house of Congress, announced on March 26 that they would
delay a vote on Zedillo's plan until September. The president had
been urging legislators to vote before the current congressional
session ends on May 1; the constitutional amendments allowing the
initiative to go forward require a two-thirds vote.
</P>
<P>
   The political brawl that the president's proposal has stirred up
is starting to worry foreign investors, especially since it follows
a series of botched privatizations and scandals surrounding
government auctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one believes privatization will take place in Mexico
without a dirty deal,'' said George Baker, an energy consultant
based in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The changes Zedillo has proposed are radical only in the context
of Mexico's long protectionism involving its energy resources. In
fact, the country's electric-industry modernization lags behind
that in other Latin American countries. Brazil and Argentina, as
examples, have allowed private investment in electricity for most
of a decade.
</P>
<P>
   When he announced the initiative in a broadcast on Feb. 3,
Zedillo argued that without the investment of vast new amounts of
money, far surpassing government financial resources, Mexico's
power industry is unlikely to satisfy surging demand, and power
shortages could soon result. Demand for electricity in Mexico is
expected to grow 7 percent annually for the next six years.
</P>
<P>
   The president used his weekly radio address last Saturday to
promote his plan. ``We need private investment to take away the
brakes now on the electric industry, which brakes all
development,'' he said, adding that the government would continue
subsidies and rural-electrification programs under a private
system.
</P>
<P>
   Most industry analysts agree with the expectations of a sharp
increase in demand for electric power and say that the economic
consequences of doing nothing could be devastating. ``Repeated
power outages are costly,'' said Rafael Quijano, a Washington-based
energy consultant. ``If electric reform is not passed, the
government will have to spend more on electricity at the expense of
hospitals and public education.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed changes, the Federal Electricity Commission
would grant 30-year concessions to private companies to operate
power plants and regional transmission grids. The commission, one
of Mexico's largest employers, would become little more than a
small government agency.
</P>
<P>
   Energy in Mexico, where the anniversary of the 1938
nationalization of the country's oilfields is an annual holiday, is
a sensitive matter.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of privatization say that the government has
exaggerated Mexico's developing electrical shortage and minimized
the number of jobs likely to be eliminated by the plan. They warn
that a proposal to sell state-owned power plants today is likely to
be followed tomorrow by efforts to break up the state oil company,
Petroleos Mexicanos, or PEMEX, an icon in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents have put forward no clear alternative plan to
finance the expansion of the country's electricity industry.
</P>
<P>
   When electricity was nationalized in 1960, only 44 percent of
Mexicans had access to electric power. State-owned utilities have
over the decades since brought electricity to 95 percent of
households. But in recent years, state investment has been unable
to keep up with the industry's needs.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, changes in the law have allowed private companies to
build power plants, including the Merida 3 electric plant in the
Yucatan peninsula, one of the nation's largest.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo's tenure ends in December 2000, and the presidential
campaign is heating up, complicating the political context for the
power initiative. Mexico has two electricians' unions that are
involved in the argument. One is firmly opposed to the plan. The
country's largest electricians' union is closely tied to Zedillo's
party and has taken no stand.
</P>
<P>
   The Party of the Democratic Revolution, the main leftist party,
almost immediately declared its opposition to the initiative. More
recently, Carlos Medina Plascencia, congressional leader of the
conservative National Action Party, which has supported most
privatization initiatives, criticized the power proposal as vague
and faulted the government for not detailing how it would regulate
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   More worrisome for Zedillo is that he appears unable to count on
solid support from his own party. Joel Estudillo, an analyst at the
Mexican Institute of Political Studies, said some party members,
``maybe many, will refuse to support electric privatization.''
</P>
<P>
   Public support for the sale of government assets in general is
eroding after a series of scandals, including accusations of
cronyism and fraud in the sale of state-owned banks and a
subsequent $65 billion bailout. The government also paid billions
to rescue a series of ill-planned private toll roads. In February,
after zigzags in the government's effort to sell the petrochemical
industry, an auction for one important plant failed to attract a
single bidder.

ARRIVAL OF RUSSIAN SHIP WILL HEIGHTEN TENSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Liman, the Russian frigate that set sail for the
Balkans Friday, is an unassuming reconnaisance vessel with a
100-member crew and no weapons. As warships go, this one will
hardly pose a military threat to the NATO force massed in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   But Liman's very presence, once it arrives in the Adriatic
sometime early next week, will raise the risk of an unintentional
confrontation between NATO and Russia. And the ship's political and
strategic effect on the fighting in Yugoslavia could be formidable.
</P>
<P>
   What worries US and NATO leaders the most is Liman's array of
electronic intelligence gathering gear, instruments that will allow
the Russian ship to carefully monitor the American-led alliance's
airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   How this information will be used concerns the allies, who claim
the damage done to Yugoslav lines of communication as one palpable
success of two weeks of bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow, which has harshly condemned NATO's airstrikes but
avoided getting drawn into the conflict thus far, says the ship
will gather information for the Russian military only. Moscow says
it needs the information because the NATO attack in the Balkan
region is a matter of Russia's national security.
</P>
<P>
   But as Liman sailed Friday from the Black Sea Fleet's base in
the Crimean port of Sevastopol, Ukraine, questions remained about
what the ship will do after it passes Turkey's Bosphorous Strait
Saturday and heads into the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   Will the Russian vessel pass on information it gathers to help
Yugoslav air defenses better target NATO aircraft? Could the
information Liman gathers be used by Russia's traditional allies
and fellow Orthodox Christian Slavs, the Serbs, to thwart a
possible NATO ground assault? One veteran Russian military analyst
says ``da.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This changes the strategic situation in the region,'' said
Pavel Felgenhauer, defense analyst for the Moscow daily Segodnya.
``At the moment, the Serbs are like blind mice. But the Russian
ships will work 24 hours a day, listening to NATO pilots, ground
control, conversations at the airbases in Italy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are going to give this information to the Serbs,
especially in real time, the Serbs are going to know more about the
NATO operation than some NATO commanders do,'' Felgenhauer said.
``The Russians could know when a NATO pilot goes to pee. NATO will
never know what the Russians are picking up, what they are sharing
with the Serbs and what they are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most likely, they'll be sharing.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington is taking this possibilty seriously enough that
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has already contacted Russian
Foreign Minster Igor Ivanov about the ship. Friday, Ivanov angrily
denied that any information would be passed on to the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a totally absurd attempt to justify NATO failures,''
Ivanov said at a Moscow briefing. ``This ship will act only in the
interests of Russia's national security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that we had put behind us the Cold War times when we
blamed the United States for everything and the United States
blamed Russia for everything,'' Ivanov added. ``You know, the times
of the `Evil Empire' and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   But the conflict over Kosovo has already flamed Cold War-style
passions in Russia. Military officials here last week said one way
Russia could help Yugoslavia would be by supplying the Serbs with
information from Russian satellites. And Russia's ambassador to the
United Nations, Sergei Lavrov, asked by a British TV station
whether such information was being exchanged, answered: ``I'm sure
that this is taking place and this is not something which is beyond
international law.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials say the decision to send Liman, taken after
NATO rejected proposals made by Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic after talks Wednesday with Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov, is part of Moscow's effort to pressure NATO into stopping
its bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has frozen relations with NATO, but the government has
also resisted the calls of some politicians to extend direct
military aid to the Serbs, saying Russia has no interest in being
involved in a Balkan war. Meanwhile, a convoy of six more warships
_ armed warships _ is getting ready to sail from Sevastopol,
according to the Russian military.
</P>
<P>
   Russian ships in the region will cause tensions to rise just by
their presence, according to John Reppert of Harvard's Kennedy
School of Government, a former US military attache here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more psychological than anything else, that you become
aware that there is a ship operating in the area'' that is not part
of the operation, Reppert said. ``For ship drivers it makes things
much more complex when you are operating.''
</P>
<P>
   Reppert said Russian intelligence had the capability to help the
Serbs, but ``you've got a difference between their capabilities and
their ability to use them.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing if the Russian ship passes on information directly
to the Serbs, NATO reconnaisance equipment is bound to pick it up.
That could put Russia, already walking a tightrope in its relations
with the West, in a tricky situation. And NATO also has the ability
to block transmissions, or otherwise convince the ship to leave the
area.
</P>
<P>
   But that also raises the possibility of a confrontation,
something some analysts believe will ensure that Liman's
intelligence goes to Moscow only.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in Russia's interest that NATO fails,'' said Dmitry
Trenin, a retired Russian army colonel and an analyst on Russian
military affairs for the Carnegie Moscow Center. ``It is in
Russia's interest to stay on the side and gather information, but
it is in Russia's interest not to get involved.''

CLINTON ORDERS BOOST IN AID FOR KOSOVAR ALBANIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Calling the humanitarian crisis in the Balkans
``grave,'' President Clinton Friday agreed to step up US efforts to
aid hundreds of thousands of Kosovar Albanians fleeing their homes.
</P>
<P>
   As relief workers braced themselves for more waves of refugees,
Washington pledged to fly 500,000 meals to the Balkans starting
Saturday, increase its $50 million donation made this week to the
United Nations and private aid groups, and help aid groups deliver
supplies to refugee centers.
</P>
<P>
   The announcements followed Clinton's meeting with private relief
organizations to assess the crisis and the US response.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be increasingly concerned about the plight of the
displaced people who are actually trapped inside Kosovo and are
under attack or certainly vulnerable to attack by Serbian forces,''
Clinton said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Relief groups made clear they are extremely concerned about the
estimated 345,000 people displaced from their homes but remaining
inside Kosovo. Since the airstrikes began, relief workers were
forced to abandon major stockpiles of food, medicine and other
supplies they were funneling to these internal refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration has been very mindful of and responsive to
the humanitarian crisis,'' said Raymond C. Offenheiser, president
of Boston-based OXFAM America who attended the White House meeting.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea also announced a decision to deploy
allied forces in Montenegro to assist the ``refugee calamity''
engulfing the region.
</P>
<P>
   Albania, Macedonia, and the Yugoslav province of Montenegro are
already staggering under a refugee inflow of 220,000 since the
airstrikes began 10 days ago. And with tens of thousands more
massing along Kosovo's border, the Clinton administration and the
United Nations are scrambling to recruit other nations in the
region to take them in.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations formally issued such a request Friday, and
countries that may be asked for help include Italy, Greece, Turkey
and Bulgaria. ``The main concern right now is finding somewhere
else to move these people,'' said a State Department official.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers are facing a challenge in Albania, where the roads
are ``horrendous,'' the people are poor, and the land is full of
``banditry,'' according to reports filed to Hugh Parma, who is
overseeing the US Agency for International Development's disaster
assistance in the region.
</P>
<P>
   In Montenegro, where NATO has bombed Serbian police and military
targets, relief workers are jeopardized by an increasingly volitile
political situation, Parma said.
</P>
<P>
   And in Macedonia, government authorities periodically halt
processing refugees, reluctant to add to their already swollen
refugee population of 86,000.
</P>
<P>
   Chaos erupted on the Kosovo-Macedonian border Friday as aid
workers threw blankets and food to the estimated 30,000 refugees
herded by Serbian forces into a field smaller than the Boston
Common. NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said people are dying as they
wait in the cold and rain without shelter, medicine, or proper
food.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt helpless,'' said Shelley Beirouk, an aid worker with
Catholic Relief Service, in an interview from Tirana, Albania's
capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Parma's disaster team said aid workers were trying to hold a
meeting between Macedonian officials and private relief groups to
move the refugees into a controlled area within Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is enough food and money to cope with the crisis,
aid workers said they needed Washington to help them transport aid
and supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about all the materials you need to build a brand new
city from the ground up,'' said Marge Tsitouris, director of CARE
International's emergency group. ``You need to build shelter, water
supplies, sanitation facilities, and then there are the simple
things you need like soap. It's an incredible task.''

DOCTOR RECALLS `DISASTER' OF WIFE'S BONE-MARROW TRANSPLANT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON -- Gail Reines was a fighter.
</P>
<P>
   At 34, when she got worried she might have a breast lump, she
insisted on a mammogram. It showed a ``teeny'' lump, says her
husband, Dr. H. David Reines, now chief of surgery at
Newton-Wellesley Hospital. ``They told her not to worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gail insisted on a mastectomy. She thought she was cured.
</P>
<P>
   A year or so after she married David, who was then head of
trauma at the Medical College of Virginia, Gail felt a pain in her
chest. The cancer had spread to her spine and neck.
</P>
<P>
   She had a bone marrow transplant in Richmond, at age 39.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, the cancer was back. By now living in suburban
Dover, Gail opted for a second transplant in Boston. It was ``a
disaster,'' says David. She died last year, at 44.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going through hell because you think it is your only hope is
not the way we should be doing things which can kill people,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   On April 15, researchers are expected to post on the World Wide
Web preliminary results of two American and three foreign studies
on the efficacy, or lack of it, of bone marrow transplantation for
women with spreading breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The data are still being analyzed and the studies are too small
and too short-term to be decisive. But there is widespread
speculation that the results will be disappointing or equivocal,
although longer studies may still show benefits for some women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have enough data or enough follow-up to be certain
about this procedure. It may be that it will be proven quite
helpful for some types of patient,'' cautions Dr. Steven Come,
director of the hematology-oncology units at Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center. ``We do have patients who are well. There is no
question there is some long-term survival'' with the treatment, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the mixed results, 5,000 women a year now undergo
transplants and in some states have legally forced insurers to pay
for it.
</P>
<P>
   In a bone marrow or stem cell transplant, immune cells are
``harvested'' and stored before the patient has high dose
chemotherapy and radiation, which destroy the bone marrow while
attacking the tumor. Then, the stem cells are reinfused to rebuild
the marrow and immune system.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years so many women like Gail Reines declined to enter
clinical trials because they feared being randomized into a control
group that would not get a transplant that it has been hard to get
the data that could better inform such decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gail refused a randomized trial because the press and her
doctors made it look like a bone marrow transplant was the only
hope,'' David says.
</P>
<P>
   Gail's first transplant, at least in retrospect, was ``a piece
of cake,'' he recalls, though paying for it was not. ``She had a
policy with the city (for which she worked as an attorney), I had
one with the state and both policies specifically excluded bone
marrow transplant. So we had the city attorney, the mayor and
people in the governor's office trying to fix it for us, but they
couldn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luckily, I worked in the hospital and they gave it to me at
cost. The doctors waived their fees,'' he says. The Reines paid
cash, $80,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gail was in the hospital, ``sicker than hell,'' for 19 days, he
says. Despite his medical training, David says he ``had to leave
the room. I was getting ill watching her. She was throwing up and
having diarrhea simultaneously. Everything was really nasty. I have
never been through anything quite like that.''
</P>
<P>
   When it came time to re-infuse her with the stem cells, David
was so upset he had to leave the hospital. ``The only thing I could
worry about was if someone spilled her cells, she would die. . . .
I had terrible nightmares.''
</P>
<P>
   Gail finally went home, ``bald and weak as a kitten,'' but over
the next few months, regained her strength. The Reines began riding
horses again. Soon after the transplant, in late 1992, they moved
to Dover.
</P>
<P>
   But the next four years would become a roller-coaster of
chemotherapy and radiation, as well as some good times and travel.
Her bones were so full of spreading tumors that it looked like her
``whole spine would collapse,'' David recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they acquired three Briards, French sheep dogs that Gail
loved, and began exhibiting in shows. ``We knew her life was
limited. We said, `Screw it. She had a dog she wanted to show in
France, so we went to France to show the dog.' '' The dog
eventually became the first American-born French champion.
</P>
<P>
   But in November 1996 a CT scan showed Gail's cancer was in her
liver. ``We knew that was a finisher,'' he says. They went to
France anyway for a dog show, but Gail got so sick she had to be
evacuated to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we had three choices _ do nothing, intensive
chemotherapy or another transplant. We talked it over and knew the
odds were terrible for anything,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Gail's team at New England Medical Center was ``incredible,''
willing to do, though not pushing, a second transplant, he says.
Gail was willing to ``do anything to stay alive, to stay with the
horses, the dogs and me.'' (Her doctor declined to comment for this
story.)
</P>
<P>
   The second transplant was like ``six weeks of being in
Auschwitz,'' says David. ``She damn near died on multiple
occasions.'' But she survived, and ``$280,000 and six weeks
later,'' went home in May.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Blue Cross Blue Shield paid because the treatment was
given according to a strict protocol, though not a controlled
study. She lived for another year in failing health, and died last
July.
</P>
<P>
   David Reines is ``not bitter, but I am sad. Women need to know
there are worse things than dying. We can't keep giving transplants
as a promise without data _ the emotion that must have pushed the
legislation to require the payment for transplants must be tempered
with reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all want the `best' for our loved ones and ourselves, but
sometimes we are wrong about what's best.''

<P>
   GUADALAJARA, Mexico _ Mexicans in the temperate plains of
midland Mexico are rising up to throw off what they see as an
intolerable abuse and usurpation by the national authorities in
Mexico City: the start of daylight savings time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 President Ernesto Zedillo used his executive powers to
order Mexico to set its clocks forward one hour in summer. This was
to save on the country's overtaxed energy supply and keep the
country in sync with the United States and Europe _ especially
their financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   To Zedillo it was an innocuous modernizing measure, but for many
Mexicans it was a major disruption. While the late sunset of summer
has virtually become a fact of nature to most Americans, in Mexico
it is an unsettling imposition that has stirred deep suspicions
against both the United States and the Mexican government.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the public's reasons for rejecting the time change are
practical. Millions of public elementary school students start
classes at 7 a.m. During the six months of daylight savings time
they have to travel to school without benefit of street lights,
which can be dangerous in a country suffering a crime epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   But many Mexicans are convinced that daylight savings time
undermines their health and sanity. A national poll by the
University of Guadalajara showed 53 percent believing that the time
change caused ``some type of biological alteration,'' including
drowsiness, headaches and ``more stress.''
</P>
<P>
   This year the approach of daylight savings time, which will go
into effect on Sunday, prompted local legislatures in Mexico City,
Guadalajara and Monterrey _ the country's three most important
cities _ to demand that the measure be abandoned. Three states _
Aguascalientes, Durango and Chiapas _ accepted the change but
immediately advanced the schedules for all schools and public
agencies, thereby defeating the basic energy-saving purpose.
</P>
<P>
   So far the only state to free itself from the national yoke is
Sonora. Officials there said they refused to be forced out of step
with their main trading partner, Arizona, which is just across the
northern border and does not observe daylight savings time. Federal
officials assented.
</P>
<P>
   The rebellion had its beginnings here in central Mexico, a
region long known for separatist tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just couldn't get used to it,'' said Ricardo Enciso Aguilar,
a lawyer who started the movement against the time change in
Guadalajara. He recalled the funk that came over him during the
first season of daylight savings time two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began having strange depressions,'' Enciso said. ``I felt
disoriented and went around half-asleep all the time. Mexicans are
not accustomed to such drastic change.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year in Guadalajara, Enciso's group collected 80,000
signatures against the change. In March he persuaded the Jalisco
state congress to call on Gov. Alberto Cardenas to defy the federal
government and stay with one year-round schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``The astronomical and mathematical data indicate that there is
a real imbalance in our body clocks as a result of the time
change,'' warns the state legislature's declaration, adding that
people would be ``more attuned to the position of the sun'' if the
time change was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   But Cardenas, after conferring for hours with a top energy
official in Zedillo's government, backed down. Enciso said, ``We
are indignant that the governor assumed such a subservient attitude
before the central powers.''
</P>
<P>
   Mateo Trevino, the director of a federal agency set up to
conserve energy, said that in two years, daylight savings time had
saved Mexico what it would take to burn 11 million light bulbs for
a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are saving nonrenewable resources with longer days,''
Trevino said. ``Unfortunately, not everyone perceives this.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans are especially resentful because of a widespread belief
that the time change was adopted under pressure from the United
States. Some believe that Mexico agreed to the measure in a secret
clause in the North American Free Trade Agreement whose terms have
remained hidden from the Mexican people.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition is rising to the point of anarchy. In the state of
Michoacan, besieged authorities decided to let people choose
whatever schedule they wanted. Some schools and offices will open
at one hour, others an hour later.
</P>
<P>
   But Victoria Gutierrez, a mother who called in to a radio talk
show about the time change, said she preferred chaos to tyranny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the government is telling us what time to eat, when to go
to sleep and when to get up,'' she said. ``And you think that is
not going to affect our well-being?''

CATHOLIC BISHOPS SEEK END TO DEATH PENALTY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Texas, Mo.)  (js) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In their first statement in 19 years focusing exclusively on
opposing the death penalty, the nation's Roman Catholic bishops
issued a call Friday to ``all people of good will, and especially
Catholics,'' to work to end capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The statement _ timed to coincide with Good Friday observances
and also calling for compassion for crime victims _ reflects a
growing concern about capital punishment among the bishops, as well
as the continuing impact of Pope John Paul II's denunciation of the
death penalty during his pastoral visit to St. Louis in January.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Roger Mahony, archbishop of Los Angeles, said in a
telephone interview that the pope's words helped prompt the
statement, written by the bishops' 55-member Administrative Board,
which represents the National Conference of Catholic Bishops
between the group's twice-yearly meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we're trying to do is expose the myth that
we as a society gain something through the death penalty,'' said
the cardinal, who is chairman of the bishops' Committee on Domestic
Policy.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show a clear majority of Americans, and a majority of
Catholics among them, support the death penalty. But twice in the
last 14 months, calls by prominent religious figures to spare a
convict from execution have touched off wide debates over the uses
of capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1998, the conservative religious broadcaster Pat
Robertson, along with others, unsuccessfully urged Texas officials
to spare the life of Karla Faye Tucker, a murderer who had become a
born-again Christian in prison. But more dramatic was Pope John
Paul's successful appeal to Gov. Mel Carnahan of Missouri to show
mercy to Darrell J. Meese, a murderer who was to have been executed
two weeks after the pope's visit.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 28, the morning after the pope spoke to the governor at
an interfaith service in St. Louis, Carnahan, a Democrat who had
approved 26 previous executions, commuted Meese's sentence to life
without parole. The governor said the decision meant no change in
his support for capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   But the pope's actions inspired the bishops.
</P>
<P>
   In March, as Massachusetts legislators considered a bill to
allow capital punishment, Cardinal Bernard Law, the archbishop of
Boston, and the bishops of the state's three other dioceses issued
a toughly worded response that although murder must be punished,
the death penalty ``must be rejected as unworthy of us as a
civilized people.''
</P>
<P>
   As a national body, the bishops have opposed the death penalty
for three decades. In 1980 they said that while it would be
``morally unsatisfactory and socially destructive'' for criminals
not to be punished, the death penalty was unjustified.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's statement, the bishops said they were concerned
about the size of the nation's death row population and the
increasing pace of executions as condemned prisoners exhaust their
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout the states, more than 3,500 prisoners await their
deaths,'' the bishops wrote. ``These numbers are deeply troubling.
The pace of executions is numbing. The discovery of people on death
row who are innocent is frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   The bishops said they also hoped to persuade people that capital
punishment ``is often applied unfairly and in racially biased
ways.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mahony said the statement represented a long-term recognition in
Catholic moral theology that society's ability to protect itself
from crime had become so effective, with modern prisons and life
sentences without parole, that capital punishment was unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   That view, he said, was made clear in Pope John Paul's
encyclical ``Evangelium Vitae'' in 1995, in which the Pontiff said
cases in which a government would need to apply the death penalty
were ``practically nonexistent.'' In St. Louis, the pope preached
that modern society ``has the means of protecting itself'' without
denying prison inmates a chance to reform.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the bishops, Mahony said, ``As disciples of Christ
and the Gospel, we have always said we have never overcome violence
by inflicting violence,'' adding, ``If you want any example, just
look at Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal said the bishops remained concerned about the
victims of crime. The statement urged Catholics to support the
families of crime victims ``as they struggle to overcome their
terrible loss and find some sense of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The bishops' statement drew praise from Jim Wallis, an
evangelical Protestant who is a central figure in Call to Renewal,
an antipoverty movement among urban evangelicals and Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Wallis, editor in chief of the religious magazine Sojourners,
said the statement would have an impact among moderate
evangelicals, some of whom, he added, have been re-thinking a broad
support for the death penalty since Ms. Tucker's execution.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Friday that despite the
continued campaign of repression by Slobodan Milosevic and the mass
exodus of refugees from Kosovo, the military and political
objectives of the Western allies were still attainable with an air
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we have quite a good chance of achieving our
objectives of the return of the Kosovars to live in security with a
measure of self-government,'' Clinton told reporters Friday as he
made a hastily announced appearance in the White House briefing
room.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke before the announcement Friday night that NATO missiles
had hit downtown Belgrade, but he asserted that Milosevic, the
president of Yugoslavia, would pay ``a heavy price'' for his
repressive policies. And he added a plea for patience, saying that
the allies ``have a good possibility of achieving our mission with
the means that we have deployed.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, speaking early Friday evening to
reporters after a lengthy military briefing, said without giving
details that the air campaign was being ``escalated,'' adding:
``Milosevic has barely begun to incur the damage he will feel to
his military and police and the security apparatus by which he
keeps his dictatorship in power.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton suggested that the framework of the failed peace talks
in France would still serve as the basis for any political
settlement, and that NATO _ and the United States _ would help the
refugees return to Kosovo and provide for their protection. For the
Kosovars to live with some degree of autonomy, he said, ``will
require, clearly, for some period of time, some sort of
international force that will be able to protect their security.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I think there will have to be some sort of security
arrangement in order for them to live safely. And then there will
have to be some sort of agreement that entails the autonomy to
which they are entitled.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, nine days into the NATO bombing campaign, Clinton
still seemed frustrated by the difficulty of explaining the
mission, its objectives and its ramifications. ``Everyone is trying
to get their hands around a very complex problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton aides said the president showed up in the briefing room
Friday partly in response to requests by television networks for
fresh footage of him before he heads to Camp David for the weekend.
They also said they wanted to show him engaged in the Kosovo
conflict, which is occupying more than 50 percent of his time each
day, but at the same time they did not want to suggest he is in a
crisis or under seige.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the president is measuring his responses to the
Balkan war and also publicly engaging in other matters. He talked
at Friday's briefing about the new unemployment figures _ the
lowest since 1970. He is planning a trip to Philadelphia next week
to discuss health care. And he will be welcoming the Chinese
premier to Washington next week as critical talks continue on
China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls taken before the missile strikes Friday
showed that a bare majority of the American public supported the
airstrikes but most believed that NATO would not achieve its
objectives.
</P>
<P>
   A CBS News poll taken Wednesday after three American soldiers
were taken prisoner by the Yugoslavs showed that 51 percent
supported the bombing and 34 percent opposed it. But a recent
survey by CNN, USA Today and Gallup found that only 41 percent
thought NATO would accomplish its objectives while 47 percent said
it would not.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton insisted Friday that Kosovo was not lost, but he also
focused on the humanitarian relief efforts that have been under way
there for a year. With images on television of refugees streaming
across the Yugoslav border, Clinton continued to try to dispel the
notion that the NATO bombing had escalated Milosevic's violence
against ethnic Albanians and prompted the exodus.
</P>
<P>
   He said that relief workers, whom he met with Friday, had told
him that the refugees supported the bombing and ``clearly
understand that that action did not provoke the attempt to remove
them from their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Asking other countries to help with the relief effort, Clinton
sought to use the plight of the displaced people to dramatize the
need for the continued airstrikes. ``There's no doubt that what
Milosevic wants to do is to keep the land of Kosovo and rid it of
its people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He brought with him to the briefing several government officials
to reinforce the idea that the exodus from Kosovo had been going on
for some time. Hattie Babbitt, deputy administrator of the U.S.
Agency for International Development, said of the exodus: ``It's
not a new phenomenon. There's a new urgency to it, there's a new
scale to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Julia Taft, assistant secretary of state for population,
refugees and migration, called Milosevic's ethnic cleansing a
``pogrom'' and said that the government had been working with
relief agencies for more than a year to respond to the uprooting.
The United States has sent $91 million to the region since last
year, and Clinton authorized $50 million more on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's White House meeting, Peter Bell, the president of
CARE, said of Clinton: ``He is sensitive to the humanitarian
dimension of this crisis. We all know that this is just beginning
to unfold.''

PROGRAMMER IN NEW JERSEY CHARGED WITH MELISSA VIRUS SCHEME 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   On Monday, Richard Smith, president of Phar Lap Software Inc. in
Cambridge, Mass., made a phone call to the FBI. Smith thought he'd
figured out the identity of an electronic criminal _ the malevolent
hacker who'd created the notorious Melissa computer virus.
</P>
<P>
   Smith wasn't absolutely certain of the virus writer's identity,
but after long hours of investigation he'd come up with two names.
One of them was that of a man he'd never met and certainly wasn't
related to _ David L. Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday night, the FBI reached the same conclusion,
arresting 30-year-old computer programmer David L. Smith of
Aberdeen, N.J., and alleging that he distributed the Melissa virus.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents and New Jersey State Police tracked David Smith
to his brother's house in Eatontown, New Jersey, and charged him
Friday with interruption of public communications, conspiracy, and
third-degree theft of computer service. After his arrest, David
Smith was released on $100,000 bond. He is scheduled for
arraignment on Monday. If convicted, Smith could receive up to 40
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he is tried and successfully convicted, he will do hard
time,'' said New Jersey Attorney General Peter Verniero. That
should sit well with computer network administrators across the
country who've spend the past week scrambling to stave off the
effects of Melissa.
</P>
<P>
   Disguised as a list of pornographic Internet sites and allegedly
named after a stripper David Smith once knew, Melissa is a ``macro
virus,'' a document with a malignant computer program built in.
People who read the document using Microsoft Word, the popular
word-processing program made by Microsoft Corp., could infect their
computers. If the infected machine had a copy of Microsoft's
Outlook e-mail program, Melissa would send a copy of itself to the
first 50 people in the Outlook address book.
</P>
<P>
   Since both Word and Outlook are so widely used, the Melissa
virus spread with shocking speed. It first appeared on a
sex-related Internet bulletin board last Friday. By Saturday, major
corporations such as Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp. were shutting
down their Internet access to cope with torrents of unwanted mail,
or simply to ensure their machines didn't get infected.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by sheer curiosity, Richard Smith has spent the last week
in the hunt for Melissa's author. But the FBI apparently didn't
need his help. The agency tracked down David Smith with the aid of
America Online, the nation's largest Internet service provider,
computer network, and with old-fashioned police procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Smith had hoped to use a more radical approach. Last
month, Smith shocked privacy advocates by finding a secret serial
number, called a GUID, embedded in documents created by Microsoft
Word. Since the Melissa virus lurks inside a Microsoft Word
document, Smith hoped he could identify its author by reading
Melissa's serial number.
</P>
<P>
   A tip from a Swedish computer expert sent Richard Smith to a Web
site run by a virus writer who identified himself with the screen
name of VicodenES. Smith downloaded copies of the viruses posted on
the site. Then he used a ``hex editor,'' a piece of software that
lets programmers read the raw data hidden inside a computer file.
Smith planned to use the ``hex dumps'' of the VicodenES files to
check for the file's GUID. Sure enough, he found that some of these
files had the same serial number as Melissa. But along the way, he
also checked a feature of Microsoft Word that stores the names of
people who create or modify files.
</P>
<P>
   A number of names appeared again and again. Some were plainly
phony ones, like Ben Dover. But others seemed more believable. And
in three separate files, he found the name David Smith, or the
initials DLS.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the New Jersey attorney general's office said
Friday that David Smith was ``definitely not'' VicodenES.
Investigators believe he took one virus from VicodinES and combined
it with another virus to create Melissa. Richard Smith's
examination of the Microsoft GUID serial number led him to the same
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Smith got an e-mail Wednesday from Rishi Khan, a
19-year-old senior in computer engineering at the University of
Delaware. Khan told him that the contents of the Melissa file were
nearly identical to a virus called Shiver that was released
sometime last year by someone calling himself Alt-F11. Smith and
Khan found that Shiver and Melissa had the same Microsoft serial
number, and even the same list of pornographic Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The implication was obvious to Smith. Melissa's creator started
out with Shiver, then modified it _ a common practice among virus
writers. ``He wrote the Melissa virus in a separate file,'' said
Richard Smith. ``When it was all written, he needed some bait to
catch people with.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Smith believes that the virus writer merely removed the
polluted code in Shiver and replaced it with his own. Richard Smith
has no idea whether Alt-F11 and the creator of Melissa worked
together, or if they're only connected by their love of
virus-writing. But he hopes the FBI will try to find out. ``There's
someone else running around who may be material to this case,''
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith says he neglected his successful software business and
stayed up into the wee hours in an effort to track down the author
of Melissa. The FBI had it somewhat easier _ it had more manpower
and the cooperation of America Online. The Melissa virus had been
posted onto the Internet using an AOL account belonging to Scott
Steinmetz, a civil engineer in Lynnwood, Wash. Steinmetz proclaimed
his innocence and AOL concluded that someone had stolen access to
his account. Together AOL, the FBI, and New Jersey law enforcement
officials traced the identity theft back to David Smith. FBI and
AOL officials won't say how they did it, but Richard Smith suspects
that AOL uses a Caller ID system that tracks the source of all
incoming calls.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Smith wasn't quite able to nail down the identity of
Melissa's creator, but he got pretty close. Now Smith hopes the
information he's gathered will enable the government to build an
airtight case against David Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Richard Smith's company is trying to get some new
industrial control software out the door, and he plans to focus on
that for awhile. ``I've got a real day job, which has been sadly
neglected this week,'' he said.

CLINTON WARNS SERB LEADERS NOT TO PUT U.S. SOLDIERS ON TRIAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Photo available on NYT database) 
 
By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Frustrated by lack of information, Clinton
administration officials Friday warned Serb leaders against putting
three captured American soldiers on trial, and NATO missiles for
the first time struck government buildings in the heart of
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Although hampered by poor weather, NATO launched eight cruise
missiles from British and U.S. ships, targeting interior ministry
buildings in the center of the Yugoslav capital and setting them on
fire.
</P>
<P>
   As the NATO bombing continued through a 10th day, the refugee
crisis worsened in nations adjacent to Yugoslavia, indicating no
letup in the campaign by Serb troops to drive ethnic Albanians from
the Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia is made up of the republics of Serbia and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from Yugoslavia on Friday indicated Serb leaders were
gathering evidence to try three U.S. soldiers captured on the
Macedonian border. According to the Serb state-run news agency,
Tanjug, the investigating judge said court proceedings in Pristina
had begun and that ``more detailed information'' will be known
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the three soldiers _ Spc. Steven Gonzales
of Huntsville, Texas, Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez of Los Angeles and
Staff Sgt. Christopher Stone of Smiths Creek, Mich. _ must be
treated as prisoners of war, which accords them certain rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no justification for putting them on trial
or displaying them in public in violation of the Geneva
Convention,'' Clinton said. ``As long as they are detained, they
have the status of POWs and are entitled to all the protections
that come with that status.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said that he held Serb President Slobodan
Milosevic and his government ``responsible for their safety and
well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   But having severed ties to Belgrade, the White House was
powerless to do much to help the captured soldiers. The State
Department asked the Swedish government, which has maintained
diplomatic ties to Yugoslavia, to relay the U.S. request that the
soldiers be released.
</P>
<P>
   But State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin said that the Swedes
``have not been able to obtain that access, and that is troubling
to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House was also struggling to deal with the pressing
problem of the growing number of refugees from Kosovo that have
taxed the resources of surrounding countries, particularly Albania
and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that, in total, between 600,000
and 700,000 refugees have either been forced to flee Kosovo or have
been displaced within the country. They estimate that 36,000
refugees poured across the border on Thursday alone.
</P>
<P>
   This week Clinton authorized an additional $50 million in
emergency aid to relief organizations who are engaged in aiding the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton also stressed that other countries must help the
United States in the humanitarian effort.
</P>
<P>
   He said ``we must be increasingly concerned about the plight of
displaced people who are actually trapped inside Kosovo and are
under attack or certainly vulnerable to attack by Serbian forces.
That is why our air strikes are now increasingly focused on
military targets there.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Clinton and his advisers met with representatives
from humanitarian groups to endorse their efforts. He also said
that NATO will support their effort by providing transportation,
shelter and logistical support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the process of airlifting humanitarian daily
rations,'' said Lt. Gen. John McDuffee, lead officer at the Joint
Chiefs of Staff for humanitarian missions.
</P>
<P>
   McDuffee said that planes will begin airlifting 500,000 food
packets to Albania. The packets include biscuits, fruit bars,
peanut butter and pasta.
</P>
<P>
   Even as humanitarian concerns grow, Clinton has vowed to
continue the air campaign against Yugoslavia, but warned it will
not be a ``week or two operation.''
</P>
<P>
   While a number of lawmakers and military experts have said that
NATO will have to send ground troops into Kosovo to stop the Serbs,
Clinton said he was not ready to entertain that option.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe that we have a good possibility of achieving
our mission with the means that we have deployed,'' the president
said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials intensified their attacks Friday evening,
striking downtown Belgrade for the first time in the air campaign.
Pentagon officials confirmed that NATO officials had hit the center
of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``This operation is ongoing and there is no sanctuary,'' the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks, which took place around 1 a.m. Saturday Belgrade
time, hit the Serbian and Yugoslavian interior ministry buildings
and sparked huge fires.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium,
acknowledged that cloudy weather in the region has hampered the air
activity in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, NATO air commander David Wilby said that pilots
were able to hit ``the full spectrum of targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilby said most of the activity was concentrated in Kosovo, in
an effort to slow the Serb's campaign to remove ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Numerous infrastructure targets, including bridges, were
struck to limit the ability of the army and the special police to
resupply their forces,'' he said.``We also attacked several staging
areas and headquarters facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilby showed a video of the destruction of a Serb army facility
that also was the base for a special police unit.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said that the bombing has not only
damaged the Serb military machine but also the average citizen of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   He said that in the last few days there have been shortages of
fuel and bread.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diesel has disappeared because its all going to the military
effort,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shea also conceded the NATO military effort had not stopped the
refugee problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are facing a crisis that reaches out,'' into the region,
said Shea. Showing up at the borders, he said , were ``families
with very little luggage, ladies in slippers, children with no
shoes and socks.''
</P>
<P>
   But Shea suggested that while Serbs had pushed women, old people
and children out of the country, they were rounding up men to be
used as human shields in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said that NATO will continue its bombing over the Easter
weekend despite pleas for a holiday moratorium by the Pope. Senior
U.S. defense officials told The Associated Press that the aircraft
carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt was moving into the region and could
join the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will only stop when President Milosevic stops,'' Shea said.

JOBLESS RATE FALLS, BUT COMPANIES ADDING FEWER NEW WORKERS

<P>
   The nation's jobless rate dropped in March to its lowest level
in 29 years, the Labor Department reported Friday, falling from 4.4
percent in February to 4.2 percent in the latest of many signs that
the labor market in the United States remains remarkably robust.
</P>
<P>
   But in a break from the feverish hiring of the last three years,
American companies added far fewer new workers to their payrolls
last month than had been typical lately.
</P>
<P>
   After creating nearly 300,000 additional jobs in February,
employers expanded payrolls by a mere 46,000 in March when a burst
of cold weather held down the usual seasonal upswing in hiring in
industries from construction and landscaping to fast food. Still,
hiring was nearly as strong as ever in most of the vast service
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for workers, particularly those at the bottom of the
ladder, the recent experience with sustained low unemployment _
joblessness has been at or below 4.5 percent for nearly a year _
has clearly started to deliver solid benefits. The 30-year trend
that has depressed pay and job opportunities the most for the least
educated and the least skilled seems to have stopped dead in its
tracks, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's really exciting about this report is that our policies
are working well for the people who need it the most,'' said Labor
Secretary Alexis Herman. ``We haven't just touched them, we've
literally propelled them into the new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   In a striking turnaround, the jobless rate among high school
dropouts fell to 6.1 percent in March, down from 7.5 percent in
February. A one-month change is not necessarily reliable, but that
is now half the jobless rate dropouts faced in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate for those with only a high school degree _
3.4 percent _ now resembles what used to be typical for college
graduates.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people who used to be hiring college grads are
setting their sights lower,'' said David Wyss, chief economist at
DRI McGraw Hill in Lexington, Mass. ``Or if they were hiring high
school grads, they're saying, `I can get by with a high-school
dropout.'''
</P>
<P>
   Minorities are benefiting enormously from the heavy demand for
workers. Last month, for example, joblessness among Hispanics fell
to 5.8 percent, the lowest level since the Labor Department began
compiling statistics separately on the group in the early 1970s.
``The fastest growing population is taking real advantage of this
fast growing economy,'' Ms. Herman said.
</P>
<P>
   The rate for blacks was 8.1 percent, close to the historic lows
reached a couple of months ago. By comparison, the jobless rate for
whites was 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the unemployment rate fell in March largely because
of a sharp contraction in the labor force. (The unemployment rate
is calculated from data gathered from a survey of households,
different from the payroll statistics collected from employers.)
But the labor force had been growing about 50 percent faster than
its long-term trend of about 1 percent a year and seems simply to
have fallen back in line with the long-term pattern in March.
</P>
<P>
   For investors, the pause in job creation came as a reassuring
hint that economic growth was cooling from the super hot 6 percent
rate at the end of last year to a more sustainable pace.
</P>
<P>
   That makes it less likely that inflation might speed up or that
the Federal Reserve would be tempted to raise interest rates. The
stock market was closed for the Good Friday holiday, but the bond
market, in abbreviated trading, registered its relief by pushing
the rate on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond down to 5.59
percent from 5.67 percent on Thursday.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, signs that the labor market remains extraordinarily tight
abound. New jobless claims are running at unusually low levels,
help wanted advertising remains near its highs and a record
fraction of consumers are reporting that jobs are plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   One telling detail in Friday's jobs report: the number of people
who quit their jobs voluntarily jumped to 13.5 percent, the highest
rate in a year and a half and evidence that American workers are
feeling confident about their prospects of finding good jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, job opportunities varied widely from industry to
industry. A spring cold snap following unusually mild weather this
winter accounted for a drop of 47,000 jobs in the booming
construction business.
</P>
<P>
   The weather may also have been responsible for the failure of
fast-food chains to hire as many workers as they usually do at this
time of the year; that trimmed 48,000 jobs from eating and drinking
industry. Landscaping and other agricultural services were down
8,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But Tom Nardone, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
said that the seasonal quirks should not be allowed to obscure the
broader picture. ``Outside the sectors that were affected by the
weather,'' he said, ``you had the same pattern of hiring that
you've been seeing for months.''
</P>
<P>
   As hundreds of layoff announcements over the last few months
foreshadowed, manufacturers are still tightening their belts. In
March, they trimmed another 35,000 workers from their payrolls,
bringing the total number of jobs lost to 391,000 over the last
year. That weakness seems, on the face of it, to contradict recent
reports from purchasing managers suggesting a broad recovery in
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, however, the dichotomy reflects ferocious price
competition, which is forcing manufacturers to clamp down on costs
in order to sustain reasonable production.
</P>
<P>
   Service companies, on the other hand, added 95,000 new
positions, close to the average of 112,000 a month over the last
year. Management consultants and engineers were in as much demand
as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Banks, brokerages, insurers and other financial services firms
added workers by the thousands. Health care companies, schools and
universities and movie chains, amusement parks and other
entertainment businesses did lots of hiring, too.
</P>
<P>
   For those wondering whether the good times can continue, one of
the most reassuring bits of news in the report was the absence of
any speed up in wage gains. ``The wage gains are surprisingly
tame,'' said Paul Kasriel, chief U.S. economist at Northern Trust
Bank in Chicago. ``If anything we've seen a slight deceleration.''
</P>
<P>
   The hourly pay of nonsupervisory workers _ admittedly a smaller
and smaller slice of the work force _ rose by 3 cents to $13.09 in
March, 3.6 percent higher than a year ago. Back in April 1998,
hourly pay had risen 4.4 percent over the previous 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with the measured change in the consumer price index
running at around 1.6 percent a year and other gauges showing even
lower levels of inflation, that's a solid gain in the standard of
living of average workers.

GALAXY PRESIDENT CANCELS PLANS TO BUILD ROSE BOWL PRACTICE
FACILITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Los Angeles Galaxy President Tim Leiweke
canceled plans to build a practice facility at the Rose Bowl
because of the stadium's lack of movement in construction and its
added cost to build the new field in parking lot area H.
</P>
<P>
   Leiweke withdrew his proposal at a Rose Bowl Operating Committee
meeting Thursday night. He was not available for comment Friday.
Galaxy general manager Sergio Del Prado said Rose Bowl officials
wanted the Galaxy to pay the cost of replacing parking stalls, in
addition to picking up the bill for the practice site.
</P>
<P>
   There was also no word on when the practice site would be built.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, we are very disappointed this didn't work out,''
Del Prado said. ``It is most disappointing to our players because
of all the promises we made to them and the coaching staff that we
would get this done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortuantely, this is something they have heard before and we
are back to square one and looking for alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   For a temporary training facility, Del Prado confirmed that the
Galaxy is looking at a vacant school in Altadena on Monday. Earlier
this year, the Galaxy toured facilities at Azusa Pacific University
and Mount San Antonio College. Prior to agreeing with the Rose Bowl
to build a practice facility, the Galaxy was leaning toward Mt. SAC
as a possible site.
</P>
<P>
   Since purchasing the team for $26 million last October,
billionaire Philip F. Anschutz has already provided the Galaxy with
a new weight room, office space and re-constructed locker room at
the Rose Bowl -- at an estimated cost of $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The cost to build the new practice facility was estimated to be
in the $250,000 range. However, the Galaxy learned the Rose Bowl
Bowl wanted Los Angeles to pay an additional $200,000 to $250,000
to replace parking spaces that would be lost for UCLA football.
</P>
<P>
   Uncertain how long the team's tenure would last at the Rose
Bowl, Leiweke decided not to spend a half million on the project
when the Galaxy could conceivably leave and build its own stadium
in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they (ROBC) could guarantee the price was a half million,
we may have been able to keep talking,'' Del Prado said. ``But
there was no idea where it would stop. It started at $250,000 and
kept getting higher and higher.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent developments have slowed negotiations between the
Galaxy and the Rose Bowl on a contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, Rose Bowl general manager Dave Jacobs and Del
Prado said the Galaxy's plans are to remain at the Rose Bowl and
look for a new training facility. As for the future, anything's
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going forward with the contract renewal with the Rose
Bowl,'' Jacobs said. ``The length of our deal with the Rose Bowl
hasn't been finalized, but there are no plans for them to leave at
this point.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Galaxy signed a two-year contract, with three
option years to play in the Rose Bowl. The Galaxy and RBOC reached
agreement on a new contract earlier this year to complete the final
two option years and add a third, which the Galaxy could buy their
way out of for $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   That new deal is yet to be signed, however, meaning the Galaxy
is in the second option year of the original three-year-option.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a new deal ready to sign but it included the practice
facility,'' Del Prado said. ``Now that that deal is off the table,
we have to start over all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiweke threatened March 20 that if the practice facility deal
fell through, he would ask out of the contract and take the team
elsewhere. That means the Galaxy could leave at the end of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're committed to making this work (at the Rose Bowl),''
Leiweke said at the time. ``But if this takes much longer and if
they make us do more than we were supposed to, then guess what? We
have an out in our contract and we'll go build our own stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiweke will discuss the Galaxy's future Monday when the team
returns from San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   He has said all along that building a new stadium is a strong
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we move, we're building our own stadium,'' Leiweke said
last week. ``We're in a unique situation. We happen to have the
resources and expertise to build our own facility. For us to spend
$30 or $40 million dollars is nothing because we know we can make
it back. We're good at that. That is what we do for a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Prado said Thursday's developments are a step in that
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a possiblity,'' Del Prado said. ``But it's
very premature at this point. I will say this, though. The Rose
Bowl has made good efforts to try and please us, it was more a
matter of city politics that binded them with the facility issue. I
still think they are good to work with and we'll explore
possibilities with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is a big difference between owning your own stadium
and going through the city. Those are the types of questions we
have to ask ourselves in the coming weeks.''

BILL BAVASI HAS BASEBALL IN HIS BLOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ One might say Bill Bavasi was born to be a major
league baseball general manager, but one would get an argument --
from Bavasi.
</P>
<P>
   Buzzie Bavasi was the general manager of the Brooklyn and Los
Angeles Dodgers and the Angels and he was president of the Padres.
So Bill, the youngest of Buzzie's four sons, has baseball in his
blood.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Bavasi is quick to point out that it takes more than
blood to stick around in the game. It's all about being successful,
and if you aren't, you'll be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi admits, however, that being the son of a general manager
had its advantages. There were the times when he and his brothers
would sneak into the Dodger clubhouse and talk to coaches like Don
Zimmer and Joe Amalfitano.
</P>
<P>
   They had to sneak because Buzzie didn't allow the boys to run
wild at the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't allowed in the clubhouse,'' said Bavasi, 41, who is
beginning his sixth season as the Angels' general manager. ``I
allow my kids (Kyle, 11, and Katie, 9) in the clubhouse only in
selected times. He had his reasons, but I never asked him. But he'd
get angry if we were in the clubhouse. Mostly we went to see the
equipment manager or the trainers and coaches. They were good
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the players' clubhouse, that was their domain,'' Buzzie
explained. ``If I let my kids in the clubhouse, what about Duke
Snider's kids, or Carl Furillo's? In my day, we let the players
make the rules. At least I did. And they said no kids.''
</P>
<P>
   At home, however, the rules were like any ``normal'' household.
Bavasi grew up in La Jolla and played some basketball in high
school and at the University of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to play in the NBA but a lack of talent nixed
that. I probably peaked in the sixth grade,'' Bavasi joked.
</P>
<P>
   It was baseball that was always there for him. And he took
advantage of the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in and around the game because of my parents,'' he
said. ``To get in the game, my family helped. To say it's anything
other than who you know is a lie. For me it was more my dad's
relationship with (then-Padres vice president) Red Patterson. Red
pushed to hire me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who I knew got me in, but the same relationships get you out
if you do a poor job.''
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi started working in the operations department for the
Padres in 1974 at age 16 and was promoted to the grounds crew in
1975. In 1980 he joined the Angels as a minor league administrator,
became director of minor league operations in 1984 and held that
position for nine years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Bavasi was named GM Whitey Herzog's assistant, a
position he held until Jan. 12, 1994, when he was named GM.
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi, though, said it was never his goal to become a general
manager. He admits that he never imagined any line of work other
than one in baseball, but it has always been a matter of dealing
with the job at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain aspects of running an organization that are
appealing,'' Bavasi said. ``But as a farm director, I didn't aspire
to be a GM. I aspired to be the best farm director I could be.
Right now, my goal is to be the best GM I can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see farm directors operate solely to become a GM and I find
it disgusting. I can't stand guys like that. They're not going to
respond in a way that is best for the organization; these guys
respond in a way that's best for them. It damages the
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi's brothers -- Peter, Chris and Bob -- are all involved in
the business of sports or politics. But Bavasi said the household
wasn't one that demanded perfection from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thankful and lucky to have grown up in a household where I
could just be a kid,'' Bavasi said. ``A lot of kids aren't that
lucky. There wasn't pressure to accomplish or succeed or make a
mark.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the goal of Buzzie and his wife of 58 years, Evit, to
make things as normal as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we never thought of it as anything else,'' Evit Bavasi
said. ``We have four wonderful sons. We were both raised in normal
households, so we knew no other way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We never really pushed (baseball),'' Buzzie said. ``We let
them do whatever they wanted to do, and they were interested in
other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one we thought might be interested was Chris. He was the
athlete. But he never got involved in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi is like no other general manager in baseball today in
that he can go to his father for advice on being a general manager.
However, both Bill and Buzzie admit that times have changed so much
that Buzzie won't always have the answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game hasn't changed, people have changed,'' Buzzie said.
``I don't think I could operate a club today. I enjoyed the
association with the players. But today, association with the
players means you like 'em, and then you'll have to pay them more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy has the perfect personality to do it today. I like the
fact that he doesn't tell you people (reporters) what he's going to
do before he does it. That youngster Kevin Malone (the Dodgers' GM)
talks all the time. It's going to backfire on him. Billy has the
personality to get along with the present-day ballplayer. He knows
the score.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Buzzie is enjoying being a fan these days. If Bill has
a question, Buzzie will be happy to try to answer it. If not,
Buzzie will just watch on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched 247 games last year on the (satellite) dish,''
Buzzie said. ``Mostly Angels games. Once a Dodger, always a Dodger,
but my heart is with the Angels. You know, blood is thicker than
water.''

   A rising tide does not necessarily lift all boats; when seas are
turbulent, some founder. And that is an apt metaphor for the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Dow Jones industrial average crested at 10,006.78 on
Monday, 87 of the nearly 3,800 issues listed on the New York Stock
Exchange sank to new 52-week lows, more than twice the number that
hit new highs.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons are many and varied: shareholder lawsuits, ailing
chief executives, questionable acquisitions, tax rulings, takeover
battles or even just doing business in an out-of-favor industry
like mining or natural gas. Interest-sensitive issues like
utilities and real estate investment trusts figured prominently on
the list. Still, analysts see long-term promise and an opportunity
to buy low in some of these battered stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of Monday's depth-plumbing stocks are highlighted in the
charts, which compare each stock's performance with that of the Dow
industrials since Oct. 14, the day before the current market rally
began in earnest and the last time the Dow index closed below
8,000. The rest, excluding preferred stocks, derivative securities
and shares of closed-end funds (29 of the 87), are listed in the
table at right. &QL;

INJURED EDWARDS TO GET FULL PAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is finally some good news on Robert Edwards. NFL
commissioner Paul Tagliabue and Players Association executive
director Gene Upshaw have reached an agreement by which the
seriously injured Patriots running back will be paid his contract
in full.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul and I have talked, and we've agreed to treat this injury
like it occurred in the Pro Bowl, even though he did not get hurt
playing in that game,'' said Upshaw. ``But he did get hurt playing
in an event connected to the game, and we're going to use that
theory to make sure this kid gets paid his money.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards blew his knee apart playing in a beach flag football
game in Hawaii two days before the Pro Bowl. He has had surgery,
and it is doubtful he will ever play again. Edwards had played only
one year on a five-year contract. Because his injury did not occur
in an NFL game, the league did not have to pay off Edwards's
contract. The Patriots, however, have already agreed to pay his $3
million bonus in full, and now the league will cover the rest of
his deal, which is approximately another $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to set up a special fund,'' said Upshaw. ``We did
the same thing when Reggie Brown from Detroit got hurt. Right now
we are going to take this (Edwards) thing year to year, because all
of us are hoping that he is going to be able to play again. But if
he can't, we will take it year to year, and when his contract is
over, we will see what we can do for him in terms of disability
(pay).''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a linebacker, was paralyzed from an injury suffered in a
regular-season game against the Jets two years ago. Edwards, thanks
to his lawyer, also has $2 million in insurance coverage, which he
will collect if he cannot play again.

<P>
   The story about the Red Sox having the highest average ticket
price _ $24.05 _ is accurate but misleading.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox have the smallest, and oldest, ballpark in the major
leagues, with 33,000 seats. The park does not contain an upper-deck
or the ``nose-bleed'' seats that cost less than $10 on average in
most parks, such as Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Factor in another 20,000 seats at Fenway Park for less than $10
and the Sox' average ticket price would be in the middle among the
30 major league teams. Only four teams in major league baseball _
the Red Sox, the Cubs, the Dodgers, and the Marlins _ own their own
stadium, which means the team is responsible for taxes, paying the
maintenance, and capital improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1981, the Red Sox have spent $80 million on capital
improvements at Fenway Park, which is like putting a tuxedo on a
pig. In other cities, the parks are owned by the city or county,
meaning no taxes are paid (Red Sox pay in full); and all
maintenance and improvements are paid by the public. Smallest,
oldest, private, taxes _ these are all major reasons why the Red
Sox are seeking a new stadium, plans for which are expected to be
announced before June 1.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Red Sox will not wear any advertising on their
shirtsleeves this year and haven't had an offer from anyone yet to
make them change their mind.

   Boston-based agent Brian Cook, who was in the news a lot here
two years ago when former Bruin Adam Oates was getting himself
traded to Washington, has been suspended by the National Hockey
League Players' Association.
</P>
<P>
   The memo sent to all hockey agents by the union claims that ``on
or about Sept. 2, 1997, Cook converted funds belonging to Adam
Oates/Center Ice Promotions, Inc., for his personal use.
Thereafter, he concealed his actions and falsely misrepresented
what had transpired to his clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``On or about April 9, 1998, and continuously thereafter, Cook
has acted to limit or thwart the NHLPA's inquiry into these
matters. Cook provided the NHLPA with false and misleading
information, documents, and materials, and failed to fully
cooperate with its investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   On or after Oct. 27, 2001, Cook may reapply for certification.
Efforts to reach Cook were unsuccessful. The phone company reports
that his phone has been disconnected.

   This is why schools want to get into the Division 1-A football
mix.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's basketball team, which just won the national
championship, gets virtually nothing in reward. The Huskies take
home $360,000, plus some expenses.
</P>
<P>
   But realistically, after their expenses, they will have hardly
anything left.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Syracuse, another Big East school, collected $5
million when its football team lost to Florida in the Orange Bowl
New Years Eve.
</P>
<P>
   As a conference, the Big East will take in $5.85 million, to be
divided among 13 teams the next six years, from the participation
of UConn, St. John's, Miami, and Syracuse in the NCAA men's
basketball tournament this year. The problem is that there are more
than 300 schools splitting the money in college basketball, and
fewer than 100 getting a piece of the action in football. Beyond
the money, the NCAA also gives participating schools scholarship
grants in aid, but like many other things involving the NCAA, the
basketball payoff system is convoluted.

   Keep your fingers crossed for Malden's Kevin McGlinchey. He'll
find out this weekend if he is going to be with the Atlanta Braves
this season.
</P>
<P>
   McGlinchey is a great story. He was drafted three years ago out
of Malden High School, but the Braves' original offer was not that
much. So his agents from Woolf Associates, Greg Clifton and Jack
Coffey, took a gamble. They played him in a junior college in
Florida, where he pitched more than he had in high school, and
before the year was over, the Braves came up with a big bonus and
signed him before he could reenter the draft.
</P>
<P>
   McGlinchey sparkled in winter ball in Puerto Rico and in
exhibition games and figures to make the Braves' terrific staff.

   The Providence Bruins have enjoyed a remarkable turnaround this
season. They already have 50 wins and, with 107 points entering
Friday night's game with Fredericton, are well on their way to the
best record in the American Hockey League. A year ago they won 19
games, and now they have staged the greatest reversal in the
league's 63-year history . . . Not true: Doug Flutie does not get
$6 million, as reported, from a made-for-television movie on his
life. The entire budget for the film will be $6 million . . .
Speaking of millions, John Calipari is in no rush to return to
coaching basketball. The former Nets coach will collect more than
$7 million on his contract with New Jersey . . . Jim Rice will
throw out the first pitch at the Red Sox' opening game in Fenway
Park. Rice will represent all of the team's all-star players over
the years, as Opening Day will kick off the All-Star celebration in
Boston this year . . . Bobby Orr will be the Grand Marshall for
this year's Hot Dog Safari, which raises more than $200,000 a year
for charity. The event will be held May 23 at Suffolk Downs, and
will attract more than 20,000 . . . One very smart West Coast
baseball man says that Mo Vaughn is in the best shape of his life
and, although he has not hit for power in the spring, will have a
big year.

   We're happy to read that Terry Glenn says he is ready to grow
up. It's about time. When Glenn broke his ankle last year, the
Patriots had to literally beg him to get surgery, which is why it
took him eight days to get to a hospital. They tried to cover it up
by saying he went to Columbus, Ohio, for a second opinion, when in
fact he was in his house here, refusing to come out. The team had
to send two employees to his house to tell him that if he didn't
get to the hospital for surgery, he was going to be fined $10,000 a
day. Those seemed to be the magic words, and suddenly surgery
seemed to be the right thing to do . . . If all of the people who
admired him as a player are on hand, the May 26 tribute to Bill
Russell, the greatest Celtic, will fill the building. If all of the
people he treated well while he played here attend, they could hold
it in a phone booth. This is why the people behind the gala
fund-raising event know they have to hit Boston businesses big to
make this work. It would be mighty embarrassing, with the
tremendous guest list headed by Bill Cosby, to have a couple of
thousand people sitting in a 20,000-seat arena . . . Quiz: Free
agency in baseball started in 1976. Since that time, the Yankees
have the best record in the major leagues, at 1,993-1,604. Who has
the second best?

   It was a good yarn Fox Sports turned out the other night that
Michael Jordan was going to buy and play for Charlotte. Only one
thing wrong with that scenario: There's a league rule that says a
player cannot own any part of a team; he has to divest himself of
any ownership before he's allowed to play. Jordan has talked twice
with Hornets owner George Shinn, who is not popular in Charlotte at
the moment. He is willing to sell half of his stake in the team to
Jordan because he wants to get a new arena built, and he feels they
will do it for Jordan but not him. If Jordan buys a piece of the
Hornets, he will run the team. But don't look for Phil Jackson to
join him, either. Word in the league is that Jackson next year will
end up with either the Knicks or the Lakers, where he can make big
bucks. There aren't big bucks for coaches in Charlotte. Dave Cowens
just got out of coaching there because he was the lowest-paid coach
in the league . . . The NFL has sent a letter to all teams to get
ready for Y2K possibilities at the turn of the century. The league
schedule has final regular-season games being played Jan. 2. The
visiting teams, which usually arrive 24 hours before the game, are
being told to travel two days before the game, to avoid any
possible problems with airline travel. Also, teams are being told
to make sure they have backup systems ready at the stadiums for any
emergency situation. The Patriots are at home against Baltimore
that weekend . . . Quiz answer: The Boston Red Sox, with a record
of 1,911 and 1,691.

 &HT;    Cox acquires newsletters business
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cox Newspapers announced Friday it had bought a
leading producer of customized newsletters for businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The company, CustomMedia, is based in Greenville, S.C., and was
founded by brothers Todd and Shane Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. The Taylor
brothers will continue to run the business out of Greenville, said
company officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``CustomMedia fits right into our strategy of growing our
company through businesses that fit with our tradition of gathering
and publishing information,'' said Jay Smith, Cox Newspapers'
president.
</P>
<P>
   CustomMedia produces more than 4,600 different newsletters
monthly. Its customers are largely the owners of apartment
buildings, including 50 of the largest. Apartment building owners
circulate CustomMedia's newsletters to their tenants. In total, the
newsletters have a readership of more than 3 million, according to
the company.
</P>
<P>
   While remaining independent, CustomMedia will be studied by Cox
Newspapers to see how its business can be improved and expanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to look at things we could do better,'' says
Brian Cooper, a senior vice president at Cox Newspapers. He said
that, for example, perhaps advertising could be added to
CustomMedia's newsletters.
</P>
<P>
   ``CustomMedia serves a market desirable to both newspapers and
cable operators,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Newspapers is a unit of Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises Inc.,
which also owns The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

 &HT;    Good samaritan calls 5-year-old's rescue `a miracle'
 &HT;    By Jim Dyer and Will Anderson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As the 5-year-old girl tottered down the wooded bluff
toward Malecio Heredia, the stranded trucker stepped away from his
rig and strained his eyes in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   Everything was slowly coming into focus as the sun dipped in the
western sky on the late afternoon of March 19. Heredia walked
closer to the rutted, red clay road near the Cobb County landfill
and started to feel queasy.
</P>
<P>
   The girl descended the hill _ gingerly placing her bare feet on
the rocks _ and Heredia noticed that the white and red warm-up suit
he thought she had on was really her thin, pale, naked body spotted
with blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dios mio,'' the 25-year-old Hispanic man muttered to himself.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny, blonde haired girl _ barely older than his own
daughter _ nervously looked over her shoulders, as if whatever she
was fleeing was still up on the bluff.
</P>
<P>
   Her curly locks were matted and disheveled and hung down over
her bloodshot eyes. Her body was covered with small cuts as if she
had just run through thorn bushes. She was bleeding heavily between
her legs.
</P>
<P>
   Her lips were so frothy and bluish-black from having been choked
unconscious that she had difficulty articulating her words. Yet for
Heredia, there was no need for her to say anything. He knew what
happened.
</P>
<P>
   The few English words that the native El Salvadoran picked up
from her mumbling corroborated his suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A man ... a gun ... my bicycle,'' she said, again looking up
the bluff as if her assailant were right behind her.
</P>
<P>
   Heredia looked up the bluff, too, and then began to fear for his
own life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK,'' he said, struggling to find English words to
comfort her. ``Nothing can happen now.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he grabbed his jacket from the truck to cover her, he
kept checking the surrounding woods.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the roads to get stuck on, he thought to himself. It
wasn't fair. He was a simple man hauling pipe to a construction
site and now he was going to get killed by some armed child
molester.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, Cobb County police would say that Heredia was
definitely in the wrong place at the wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   How he and the young girl met on a lonely dirt road near Jim R.
Miller Park is a story of bizarre coincidences and a heinous act
from a man whom experts believe is local and may strike again.
Moreover, it's a tale of a simple trucker's faith in God and his
steadfast belief in divine intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Before that Friday, children played freely in the Wynforest
Apartments, a cluster of nine brick buildings just south of
Marietta, a suburb of Atlanta. Young boys and girls grabbed their
toys and played on the grass or rode their bicycles up and down the
sidewalks and through the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're close. You may not know everyone's name, but you know
them by sight,'' said Steve Bracken, a 39-year-old single man who's
been living in the complex for the past year. ``Nobody thought
something like this would happen to that little girl.''
</P>
<P>
   The girl, who neighbors described as intelligent, friendly and
energetic, was pedaling her bicycle around the parking lot in front
of her apartment about 4 p.m. when a young white man in his late
teens or early twenties pulled up in a sports utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's mother had been outside with her and her younger
sister, but took the younger girl inside for just a moment,
neighbors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you help me find a man?'' the stranger asked the girl on
the bike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know a man,'' the girl remembered answering.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next is sketchy, police say. Somehow, the man
coaxed the girl into his car and quickly drove off. Her mother
returned to find her daughter's bicycle on the ground less than 40
feet from the family's door.
</P>
<P>
   ``It only took a couple of seconds,'' Bracken said. ``It's
amazing no one saw it happen. That guy really had (guts) to come in
here in broad daylight when any one could have seen him.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the car, the girl noticed a dark handgun beside the man's
leg and became nervous. As he drove west toward Jim R. Miller Park
and the landfill, he told her to take off her clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The girl remembered getting out of the vehicle in a remote
location near a trash can and being led into some woods. There,
police said, the man choked her unconscious and sexually assaulted
her.
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon, she regained consciousness and found herself
buried underneath logs, branches and leaves. After pushing the
debris off of herself, she headed south down a lonely dirt road on
a bluff that ran underneath a series of massive steel power lines.
</P>
<P>
   She walked south along the road, trying to escape from the man
who attacked her. Down below the bluff, a man stood next to a truck
stuck in the mud.
</P>
<P>
   Malesio Heredia's vanilla-colored jacket looked gray against the
girl's pale naked body, but he could sense it made her feel safer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK,'' he kept repeating to her while he helped her into
the front seat of his truck. ``Nothing happen now.''
</P>
<P>
   But his feigned bravado was coupled with real anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   The girl kept looking back up the hill and making him nervous.
Somewhere out in the woods, deep inside the cluster of dirt roads
and rocky gulches that crisscross the landfill, Heredia was sure
the girl's assailant was lurking. The Hispanic trucker had to get
help and reached for his business radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have problem. Hurry. Come here right away,'' he called in to
his supervisor. ``Lost girl. Something happen to her.''
</P>
<P>
   He knew he wasn't conveying the seriousness of what had
occurred, nor the danger he felt. He tried to slow down, but he was
too nervous. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't think of the
English equivalent of violar: to rape.
</P>
<P>
   He cast a reassuring look at the girl and then nervously peered
out into the woods for any sign of her attacker. He wondered if the
man was the same person who entered his rig an hour earlier while
he walked a mile to a restaurant to call for help. He returned to
find his duffel bag gone and fresh tire tracks running alongside
his rig.
</P>
<P>
   He wondered if the man had unsuccessfully tried to kill the girl
and asked himself, ``Is he watching us now?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Please,'' Heredia yelled back into the microphone, ``come
right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few minutes, the waiting became too much to bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on,'' he told the girl and gently helped her out of his
rig.
</P>
<P>
   The short walk south to Callaway Road seemed to last an
eternity. Heredia thought about his wife and his 3-year-old girl at
home. Then he looked at the girl at his side and envisioned how
much emotional pain she would have to endure for the rest of her
life.
</P>
<P>
   The two reached the road just as police arrived. Heredia smiled
in relief. He felt like a life-saver, a quasi-hero who could relish
that both he and the girl had survived.
</P>
<P>
   But his jubilation was short lived. There was a great deal of
commotion and he was immediately separated from the girl. Within a
few seconds he went from being a hero to being the main suspect in
the girl's assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a white man,'' the girl told police seconds after
Heredia delivered her to them.
</P>
<P>
   But the strange circumstances, the almost freak coincidences
that brought the Hispanic trucker to that lonely dirt road and kept
him there for eight hours were too bizarre to believe. Police
impounded his truck and interrogated him until late that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to make sure he wasn't connected someway in the
crime,'' Officer Dana Pierce later said. ``He was in the wrong
place at the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Heredia sees the events leading up to his meeting with the
girl differently.
</P>
<P>
   The gates to the landfill were meant to be closed, he suggests.
He was supposed to look for a back entrance and find that dirt
road. His truck was supposed to get stuck in that exact location
and he was supposed to wait for eight hours for a tow truck that
would never come.
</P>
<P>
   ``God sent me there,'' the deeply religious man said. ``There's
no other reason I'd be stuck back there that long. It's really a
miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   After the girl's assault, Cobb County police were in full
throttle, scouring through the woods surrounding the landfill
searching for evidence. They interviewed friends, family and
neighbors of the 5-year-old victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police really made their presence known,'' said Bracken,
who is close friends with her parents. ``You could tell they really
hated what happened to her and wanted to catch this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   With the girl's assistance, an artist made a composite drawing
of the suspect, but because of her age, investigators are not
convinced the sketch is accurate. Detectives checked out similar
crimes in metro Atlanta and Georgia, but found none that appear to
be connected.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives have also used information from the statewide sex
offender registry in their search for a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Although Interstate 75 is less than five miles away from the
girl's home _ a fact that may point to a transient criminal from
another area _ police believe the man is familiar with the area and
may live in the county.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's somebody local,'' said Cmdr. Robert Hulsey, who
heads Cobb County's crimes against persons unit.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is because the man drove his young victim to a
remote, wooded area near the landfill, where ruts in the road make
driving difficult for most cars, except four-wheel-drive trucks and
sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Because violent stranger-on-stranger crimes against children are
so rare _ there's typically less than 200 a year nationwide _
police have contacted the FBI to help them profile the man.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in behavioral sciences and criminology disagree over the
suspect's motives and on whether his ultimate goal was homicide.
</P>
<P>
   Emilio Viano, a professor of criminology at American University
in Washington D.C., doesn't believe the man's goal was to kill the
girl.
</P>
<P>
   The elements of the crime point to a man whose fantasy is to
asphyxiate his victims while sexually assaulting them, Viano
contended. Such deviant sexual behavior _ often portrayed in
pornographic ``snuff films'' _ is not as rare as the general public
thinks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had intended to kill the child he may have used a tool,
a belt, cord, to strangle her permanently,'' he said. ``To me, that
she survived and only passed out, he wasn't paying close attention
to whether she was alive or not.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Patricia Kirby, a former FBI profiler and current
professor of sociology/criminology in Maryland, disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   That the man covered the girl's body up shows he was convinced
she was dead and was disposing of the body, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other elements of the crime point toward a more seasoned serial
rapist/murderer who knew the area and carefully planned out his
actions, she said. The fact that he abducted the girl in broad
daylight from a relatively crowded apartment complex and used a
sports utility vehicle to reach the remote area suggests a well
thought-out plan, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not his first or last crime. It simply went too
smoothly to be his first time,'' she said. Kirby agreed with Cobb
County investigators that the man is probably local, but said he
may have left the area if he felt in danger of being apprehended.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man is very dangerous,'' she warned. ``It's not going to
stop with this child.''
</P>
<P>
   All throughout Marietta and especially at the Wynforest
apartments, communities are making sure to watch out for suspicious
strangers and warning their children about the dangers of
approaching unknown people and cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is really looking out for each other,'' said Sandra
Griffin, who lives at Wynforest. ``When somebody comes in here who
doesn't belong, we get rid of them now.''
</P>
<P>
   The abducted girl has been released from the hospital and is
back at school.
</P>
<P>
   ``She still has spunk,'' Bracken said. ``At first, even though
she smiled, there was a sadness behind her eyes. But that's gone
now. She's doing all right. Her family has really pulled together
to make sure she comes out of this OK.''

 &HT;    Interest in concrete product building
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The residential market for synthetic stucco washed out
like a broken dam two years ago after consumers complained about
moisture intrusion.
</P>
<P>
   But before you could say ``plug the hole,'' a spate of
alternative products began filling it up. Their manufacturers have
been trying hard to sell metro Atlanta builders on other ways to
have the look and insulation qualities of stucco.
</P>
<P>
   None of the alternative products is new. Most have been staples
outside the United States for years, and all claim to offer
homeowners more for their money.
</P>
<P>
   These newcomers are willing to spend money _ lots of it _ to
grab a foothold in metro Atlanta, one of the nation's most
lucrative housing markets. Guess ``millions,'' and you won't be far
off the mark, says Richard Martin, who teaches construction systems
at Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very unclear, because none of them is really willing to
release cost information,'' he said, explaining that besides
manufacturing and marketing costs, money is spent to get the
product to conform to Georgia building codes.
</P>
<P>
   Hebel AG, a German firm whose concrete-based product has been
used since the 1950s in residential and commercial projects
worldwide, is one of them. The self-insulating material is
fireproof, impervious to insects and all but soundproof. It will
not warp or rot. Lightweight and able to be nailed or cut with a
saw, the blocks and panels are used to frame a house. An exterior
finish _ such as synthetic stucco, stone or other veneer _ is then
applied.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company had to face two issues when it entered the
American market. One was the tremendous cost _ $30 million by some
estimates _ of building its facility in Adel to manufacture the
product, a system of autoclaved, aerated concrete blocks and
panels. Then, getting the product code-approved nationally involved
a three-year process costing more than $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The other factor was builder resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came into this market with tremendous common sense,''
said Martin. ``You give them your drawings, they engineer the
system for you, and you go build it. But (in the United States) you
run up against our contractor process. ... The contractor is stuck
with the risk, and he is not about to try anything new.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hebel system replaces many of the materials, such as
insulation and wood framing, used in a typical house. It is also
more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   West Cobb County builder Glenn Miller paid about 8 percent more
than traditional framing for his own 2,700-square-foot house in
Macland Forest. At the same time, he was able to use less
insulation, drop the size of his heating/air conditioning system,
improve his fire insurance rating and cut maintenance costs.
</P>
<P>
   Hebel offers other benefits to owners with different concerns.
</P>
<P>
   One house, being built deep in the mountains to withstand a
feared Y2K Armageddon, was even tested to see if it was
bulletproof. It was, said Holli Clark, vice president of CLF
Contractors, which installs Hebel.
</P>
<P>
   Any consumer using these new products ultimately gets more for
the money, said Bill Olsen, president of Elite Cement Products,
which makes cementitious exterior coatings as well as tile grouts
and various mortars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hebel is far superior to any kind of wood or EIFS system,'' he
said. ``You have an 8-inch-thick wall as opposed to a 3 1/2-inch
wall. You have a more durable product, and no one in the industry
would question that. They would question the speed of erection and
the cost. If it were cheaper than wood, it would have the market,
no question about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another company seeking market share is Sider-Oxydro, a
30-year-old French firm whose only American plant is in
Hawkinsville, Ga. It makes an exterior finish product that is hosed
or troweled onto a house. The patented mixture of portland cement,
crystallized cellulose fibers and chemical additives is a one-coat
finish.
</P>
<P>
   According to marketing director Ivan Burgand, it is 3 percent
cheaper than brick. Local distributor Chris Lee added that is $1.50
to $2 per square foot less than the new EIFS, which costs about $7
per square foot. It is being positioned as an environmentally
friendly, next-generation product. This company, too, has had to
think out of the box to bring its product to the public's
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have spent our money on trying to get builders to think
differently,'' said Chris Boyett, marketing manager for
Sider-Oxydro. ``We have probably spent $250,000 for advertising, a
Web site and brochures. We sat down with manufacturers ... and with
various installation groups, specifiers and architects.''
</P>
<P>
   But why is it so hard to court builders?
</P>
<P>
   ``Go look at the aqueducts in Italy. Think how little
construction has changed (since Roman times). It is a conservative
industry, driven by trying to control risks. . . . You have a
built-in propensity to resist change,'' observed Herman Oellerich,
chief operating officer of Hebel. ``You have an inordinate amount
of marketing overhead before you get accepted in the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   To increase the number of Hebel houses in the Southeast from 600
estimated now to 60,000, the company is spending $450,000 for
advertising alone this year. It is holding frequent get-acquainted
workshops for consumers and contractors, hiring and training field
installation supervisors, and calling on custom builders like David
Chatham.
</P>
<P>
   Chatham, president of Chatham Holdings, one of Atlanta's oldest
and best-known builders, used Hebel to construct the 1995 Southern
Living Home Show model home.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie and Connie Saunders, owners of Custom Design Builders,
built a Hebel house in Bradshaw Farm in Cherokee County in 1997.
They have since used the product twice on high-end homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like it, our subcontractors adapted to it well, and we know
that the more we use it, the more price-effective it will be,''
said Connie Saunders.
</P>
<P>
   But even with parts of the industry becoming attentive to Hebel,
it will take awhile to break even. Oellerich guesses a decade.
</P>
<P>
   He cites manufacturing costs and sophisticated equipment, the
money and time related to having the product tested for compliance
with the building codes, efforts to market it to consumers but _
most of all _ achieving builder acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we want,'' said Hebel Marketing Manager Mike Sweeney,
``is for Mr. and Mrs. Smith to walk into Chatham's model or
Wieland's model and say, `We love the layout of this house. Can we
build it with an Hebel system?

COURIER OUTLASTS BRITISH OPPONENT HENMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, England _ Jim Courier is off the floor and rising,
arms flapping, as though he's trying to fly to the moon, or at
least chin himself on a girder far above the slate blue hard court.
However, gravity wins _ as he has just done _ and Jim comes back to
earth. Not mentally, though. He's still way up high, riding the
kind of victory that has been mostly out of reach in the years of
tumbling from global No. 1 to his present proletarian 54.
</P>
<P>
   This brilliant long-distance, greasy-grinder triumph over No. 7,
homeboy Tim Henman, had slithered through Courier's greedy fingers
four times. It appeared to be gone for good as their gripping Davis
Cup battle edged toward a fifth hour _ but Courier, with shots that
flamed like his hair, refused to let it go: 7-6 (7-2), 2-6, 7-6
(7-3), 6-7 (10-12), 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   Five suspenseful, extremely high-quality sets, twisting and
turning like a Sherlock Holmes mystery by onetime Birmingham
resident Arthur Conan Doyle. Finally Courier got his man, although
it was anything but elementary.
</P>
<P>
   Enspirited by Courier's refusal, Todd Martin came on as cleanup
man for the United States Friday to mop Greg Rusedski even more
roughly, 6-4, 6-4, 6-2. Considered used-up goods until Pete Sampras
and Andre Agassi gave the team a pass, Courier and Martin posted an
astounding 2-0 US lead over Great Britain in the best-of-five
series, 1 point from the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not over,'' cautioned US captain Tom Gullikson, recalling
1994 and a 2-0 lead blown at Sweden, Martin losing the decisive
fifth match to Magnus Larsson. Doubles Saturday (Henman-Rusedski
against Courier-Alex O'Brien) is followed by Sunday's reverse
singles.
</P>
<P>
   Condition bonkers. That was the atmosphere within The National
Indoor Arena, stuffed with 9,320 ravers (virtually all of them
British loyalists), awash in Union Jacks, Crosses of St. George,
and patriotic trumpeting and stomping as Courier hung on the
fifth-set ropes, 3-3, 0-30. His last, best opportunity seemed
dissipated when Henman muscled up and served out of two break
points (15-40) in the previous game.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 0-30, Courier needed a point badly. He got it with one
of his patented backside-boogie forehands, sliding to his left to
deliver an inside-out ripper diagonally past Henman.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a must,'' he remembers the shot that turned the match
and the day the way of the US. Three more points were his quickly.
Though Henman, the nifty, free-flowing 24-year-old shotmaker who
has lifted Great Britain from the tennis junkyard, would keep
serving tough to 5-5, Courier was feeling ``reassured'' by his
seventh game escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was serving big myself, and getting really pumped,'' he
said. ``I was thinking how much I was enjoying this, relishing
being part of such a great match _ win or lose.''
</P>
<P>
   And suddenly it was over _ in a blink and a blitz of the last 8
points. Courier banged an ace, a service winner and swiftly was at
5-4. He swatted a forehand passer, and Henman double faulted for a
16th time, 0-30.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses of th 4-hour-12-minute extravaganza would agree with
Courier: ``A match I'll remember for 50 years _ the kind of match
that keeps an old guy (28) like me playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Henman feels similarly, ``But the memory will be greater for
him. I learned something about Davis Cup that I never understood
before. It's a new level, new intensity. This loss hurts worse than
my Wimbledon semifinal (to Pete Sampras) last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Courier reached back to his No. 1 year to sip some vintage '92,
and toast himself with a balanced blend of shotmaking. ``I've
screwed up some matches like this, but I've been here before.
That's important. I know how to stick in _ and today I had the
shots to go with it'' _ and fewer errors, 40-66.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, ranked No. 8 but a team man to the core, had skipped the
Lipton to rest himself and strained abdominal muscles for this
test. ``This is more important to me than any tournament. I had to
wait a long time for Jim to finish, but that was good. The more
anxious I get the better I play.''
</P>
<P>
   Theirs was largely serve-and-volley stuff, brief points, Martin
jumping on the No. 11 lefty immediately to break, and keeping
fierce-serving Rusedski down and distraught with consistent,
unnerving returns.
</P>
<P>
   He had seen that closing forehand of Courier's on the dressing
room TV _ ``It gave me a boost.''
</P>
<P>
   It made Courier airborne.

(ATTN: N.Y.) 
N.J. SOFTWARE PROGRAMMER ARRESTED, CHARGED WITH LAUNCHING MELISSA
VIRUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ After a global search for the author of the
fastest-spreading computer virus in history, investigators in New
Jersey arrested a 30-year-old software programmer Thursday night
and charged him with writing and launching the now-famous Melissa
virus.
</P>
<P>
   The programmer, David L. Smith, 30, was taken into custody after
FBI agents and officials from America Online helped investigators
from the New Jersey attorney general's office hone in on the
Internet access provider that was apparently first used to send the
virus, which has now infected more than 100,000 computers
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators then spent three days sorting through thousands of
customers' files and electronic transmissions from the provider,
Monmouth Internet Corp. of Red Bank, N.J., and determined that the
telephone line used to send the first copy of the Melissa virus was
wired into Smith's apartment in Aberdeen Township, according to
Attorney General Peter J. Verniero.
</P>
<P>
   Since March 26, when the virus was first uploaded to the
Internet newsgroup alt.sex from a stolen America Online account,
the Melissa virus spread like a malignant chain letter, invading
computer users' e-mail programs and sending itself to as many as 50
correspondents in each user's e-mail address book.
</P>
<P>
   Although Melissa was not as destructive as other viruses that
can destroy files or corrupt hard drives, technology experts say it
is an ominous threat to Internet commerce because it used a new,
and particularly efficient, method of transmission to replicate at
an extraordinarily rapid rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible that in the near future, viruses could spread
around the globe in a matter of an hour or two, and if it's a
destructive virus, do incredible amounts of damage,'' said Steve R.
White, senior manager of anti-virus research at IBM's Watson
Research Center in Hawthorne, N.Y. ``It's going to demand an entire
new way of combating them, new approaches and new technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Smith, who apparently named the virus after a
topless dancer in Florida, was a programmer for a software company
that writes code for AT&AMP;T, but they would not identify the company.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors and acquaintances described him as a prototypical
computer zealot, a man who lived with his two cats and whose social
life seemed to revolve around the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Trautmann, who lives one floor below Smith in the Ken Garden
apartment complex in Aberdeen, said he rarely ventured out of his
apartment or spoke to neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very solitary person; he was a quiet neighbor,'' said
Ms. Trautmann, a quality assurance specialist at a software
company. ``I'd hear his modem go off once in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   The only person at the Ken Garden apartment complex Friday who
could recall conversing with Smith was a technician from the
Cablevision company, who three weeks ago asked him if he'd like
cable television installed in his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fellow said, `No, I'm always on my computer,''' said the
technician, who identified himself only as John.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who was arrested at his brother's apartment in Eatontown,
N.J., was charged with interruption of public communication, theft
of computer services and wrongful access to computer systems. He
was released on $100,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Distributing a computer virus is also a federal crime, but
Verniero said he doubted federal charges would be necessary because
the New Jersey statutes provided for a possible $480,000 fine and a
maximum prison sentence of 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's convicted, he will do hard time, ''Verniero said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Smith was also charged with conspiracy to interrupt
public communication, Verniero would not say whether officials were
looking for other suspects. Some private anti-virus experts said
the so-called ``digital fingerprints'' on the code embedded in the
virus indicated there were at least two programmers involved.
</P>
<P>
   The Melissa virus was embedded into an e-mail attachment, and
designed to exploit a feature of the Microsoft Outlook e-mail
program, so that each time the infected document was opened, it
automatically sent itself out to as many as 50 other people.
Technology experts fear that other high tech saboteurs may use
similar techniques, known as worm programs, to transmit more
harmful viruses in the future, at speeds which far outpace the
current ability to prevent, detect or disable them.

IN THE STAMPEDE TO BIG STOCKS, SOME MANAGERS ARE LEFT BEHIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, April 4)  
 (bl)  
 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite some sharp ups and downs, the bull market in
large-capitalization stocks plowed forward through the first
quarter, confounding some money managers and rewarding others.
</P>
<P>
   The story was no different for the five managers who have built
hypothetical retirement portfolios for The New York Times: None of
their portfolios lost money in the quarter, but only three beat the
average return of 0.96 percent for diversified domestic equity
funds, as tracked by Lipper Inc. In comparison, the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index of large companies gained 4.65 percent in
the period.
</P>
<P>
   The winner for the quarter, with a return of 4.56 percent, was
Sheldon Jacobs, editor of the No-Load Fund Investor in Irvington,
N.Y. Jacobs' portfolio was helped by hefty stakes in
large-capitalization stocks, and he expects more strong market
gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I anticipate that the bull market will continue through the
second quarter,'' Jacobs said, because the factors propelling it _
low inflation, low interest rates and a strong economy _ are still
in place. ``I don't think that we have seen the highs for the Dow
this year,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Half of Jacobs' portfolio is invested in two funds: the Vanguard
500 Index, which mimics the performance of the S&AMP;P 500, and
Vanguard Total Stock Market Index, which has much broader holdings.
The portfolio also includes Vanguard Windsor II, a large-cap value
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs plans no changes to the portfolio, despite relatively
poor showings by some of his international stock funds. ``It's a
long-term commitment, so for a minor drawdown it's not worth doing
anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The market bias toward large-cap stocks continues to hold back
managers with more diversified portfolios, including Harold
Evensky, a financial adviser in Coral Gables, Fla. Evensky took
fourth place in the quarter, with a portfolio gain of 0.50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   He remains a firm believer in asset allocation, although he said
that during the quarter, a sobering market adage from John Maynard
Keynes came to mind: Markets can remain irrational longer than you
can remain solvent.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Evensky also plans no changes to his portfolio.
``While value and small-cap stocks continue to buck history and
significantly underperform the handful of lottery winners driving
the S&AMP;P 500, I continue to believe in long-term investing,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The performance of the hypothetical portfolios is tracked each
quarter by Lipper, which is based in Summit, N.J. It excludes sales
charges, transaction costs and taxes, because most retirement money
is held in tax-deferred accounts. The five managers can choose any
funds open to new investors and can shift money quarterly. At the
outset of the competition, in July 1993, they were asked to pick
portfolios intended to grow for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs remains the overall leader, with a gain of 140.15 percent
since the contest began. In that time, the five portfolios have
risen an average 111.99 percent, compared with a 227.71 percent
return for the Vanguard 500 Index fund.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Kobren, president of Kobren Insight Group and editor of
Fidelity Insight in Wellesley, Mass., took second place in the
quarter, with a gain of 3.11 percent. He was hurt by a 15 percent
position in Fidelity Small Cap Stock as well as a 25 percent
position in Fidelity Spartan government Income, which fell as the
stock market rose to record levels.
</P>
<P>
   Kobren, whose portfolio is made up entirely of Fidelity funds,
said that he felt uncomfortable investing only in equities with the
market at such high valuations. But given the portfolio's long-term
objective, combined with the economy's surprisingly strong showing,
an all-stock portfolio seems in order, he said. So he is selling
his bond position and buying a 20 percent stake in Fidelity Value,
which he said could be a big winner if the market broadens,
reflecting a modestly stronger-than-expected economy, better
prospects among industrial companies and the recovery of
beaten-down value stocks.
</P>
<P>
   He is also adding 5 percent to his position in Fidelity
Contrafund II; he said a quarter of that growth fund was invested
in technology, a modest level compared with some of its most
aggressive peers.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Brill, a San Diego investment adviser who advocates
``socially responsible'' investing, took third place for the first
quarter, with a gain of 2.64 percent. The return was bolstered by
big holdings in large-cap stock funds, including Domini Social
Equity, an index fund that is considered a socially responsible
proxy for the S.&AMP; P. 500.
</P>
<P>
   This quarter, he is replacing Calvert Capital Accumulation, a
mid-cap growth fund, with IPS Millennium, a growth-and-income fund.
He described the IPS Millennium fund manager, Robert Loest, as a
``New Age economist'' who uses a model called ``evolutionary
ecosystems mechanics'' to evaluate how changes in technology and
society affect the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Brill said the fund was not as widely screened for socially
responsible investments as others in his portfolio; its major focus
is on animal rights. IPS does not invest in poultry or fertilizer
companies, for example, because of environmental concerns, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In last place for the quarter was Susan Dziubinski, who edits
the Morningstar Fund Investor. Her portfolio gained just 0.35
percent, hurt by its very limited exposure to large-cap stocks.
TIAA-CREF Growth and Income, her sole large-cap fund, which she
added in the last quarter, beat the S.&AMP; P. 500 by gaining 6.18
percent. But that was more than offset by holdings in small-cap
stock funds like Skyline Special Equities, which fell 11.83
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dziubinski, however, plans no changes to her portfolio,
which remains mostly entrenched in funds that buy small- and
mid-cap stocks. She expects the high valuation of the large caps to
take its toll eventually. ``I just can't justify putting money into
big stocks when the S&AMP;P 500's trailing price-earnings ratio stands
near 35,'' she said.

NATO STRIKES BELGRADE FOR FIRST TIME: INTERIOR MINISTRIES IN
FLAMES
</HEADLINE>
  (ac)  
  
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Cruise missile explosions shook downtown
Belgrade early Saturday morning, devastating both the Yugoslav and
Serbian Interior Ministry buildings and sending flames at least 12
stories high.
</P>
<P>
   A series of enormous blasts wrenched a rainy Belgrade awake at
about 1 a.m. Saturday, the first time in 10 days of NATO airstrikes
that the heavily populated center of the Yugoslav capital was hit.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters and emergency workers rushed to the area but seemed
unable to control the fires, which swept through the concrete and
glass buildings. Instead they struggled to keep the fires from
spreading to other buildings in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The two buildings face one another across Kneza Milosa and are
only a few hundred yards from a large university medical complex
that contains 4,000 of Belgrade's 5,000 hospital beds, according to
the city's deputy mayor, Milan Bozic.
</P>
<P>
   As the flames burned through the buildings, the street lights
along Kneza Milosa continued to function.
</P>
<P>
   The missile strikes made good on NATO's vow to bring the war in
Kosovo home to the Serbian and Yugoslav power structure of
President Slobodan Milosevic, but it was unclear whether they would
hasten an end to his war in the southern Serb province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It is the troops and police of the Interior Ministry who have
been most responsible for the war against the Kosovo Liberation
Army and for driving ethnic Albanian civilians from their homes in
Kosovo province. While NATO has been attacking police and army
units in Kosovo, this is the first attack on the central
headquarters of the security forces that are an important pillar of
Milosevic's regime.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear if there were any people in the
buildings, after all of NATO's warnings over the past few days that
government buildings would be hit in downtown Belgrade. If there
were people inside, it was hard to imagine that they could survive
the conflagrations.
</P>
<P>
   It was a rainy night in Belgrade, with cloud cover, but the
cruise missiles are unaffected by clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian state television immediately began broadcasting pictures
of the destruction and the flames, video that was immediately
picked up and broadcasted around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said that at least eight cruise missiles were
launched.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO's attacks against air-defense systems and units in
Kosovo have so far failed to stop the Serbian offensive against the
ethnic Albanians, NATO officials have warned that its targets would
be expanded.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes marked a sharp escalation _ to Phase 3, as NATO
calls it _ in the campaign to force Milosevic to accept a
Western-drafted peace plan for nearly complete autonomy for Kosovo
that would include the introduction of nearly 30,000 NATO
peacekeeping troops.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, NATO forces blasted bridges, army barracks and other
targets, while Yugoslavia responded with television reports about
the three servicemen who were captured. To bolster Yugoslavia's
argument that the men were captured inside Kosovo, and not in
Macedonia, television showed interviews with villagers in
Slavujedac, on the Kosovo side, saying that the men's Humvee had
traveled through the town and did not stop when ordered to do so by
Yugoslav officers.
</P>
<P>
   The official Tanjug news agency quoted a Pristina official,
Jovica Jovanovic, saying that a military court has opened an
investigation into the case of the three soldiers, collecting
evidence to see if they should be brought to trial.
</P>
<P>
   There was no response to President Clinton's demands that they
be released, and no indication of where they were being held.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Friday, Milosevic moved to control one of the few remaining
sources of independent journalism here, Radio B-92. B-92, which had
its transmitter disabled just before the bombs fell but which was
broadcasting on satellite and the internet, was silenced early
Friday morning. Police arrived and the general manager was fired
and replaced by a Milosevic loyalist, putting the station
effectively under government control. The staff was instructed to
go home and return on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the mandatory work rules in effect during this state of
war, the staff may be prosecuted if they do not work to the beat of
the new drummer. But the station's editor-in-chief, Veran Matic,
vowed at a press conference not to ``collaborate'' and said the
regime wanted to destroy one of the last symbols of a free press
here.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, a number of other independent newspapers and
radio stations were closed throughout Kosovo, as well as Radio 021
in Novi Sad, Serbia's second-largest city.

MCDOUGAL WITNESS DESCRIBES PRESSURE FROM PROSECUTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark.)  (js) 
 By STEVE BARNES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ Two parts of the wide-ranging investigation
of President Clinton converged here Friday, when a woman testified
in behalf of a former business partner of the president and Hillary
Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Hiatt Steele of Richmond, Va., who says she was indicted
on charges of obstruction of justice and making false statements
after refusing to lie to a grand jury, was the final defense
witness for Susan McDougal, the former business partner of the
Clintons who says she was pressured to lie to another grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McDougal's repeated refusal to cooperate with Kenneth
Starr's inquiry into the Clintons' personal and political finances
has resulted in her trial here for contempt of court and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steele testified Friday that she believed she could have
avoided legal difficulty had she falsely corroborated the
accusations of Kathleen Willey, a former White House volunteer who
has said she was sexually harassed by Clinton in the Oval Office in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steele said she had no knowledge of any such encounter but
initially supported Ms. Willey's account, at her request, in a
magazine interview. Subsequently summoned before a grand jury,
however, she disavowed her earlier statements despite what she
described as coaxing by Starr's prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said to me, `Couldn't it be this? Couldn't it be that?'''
Ms. Steele recalled, testifying that she was convinced she could
have avoided indictment by tailoring her grand jury testimony to
the prosecutors' liking. ``But it wouldn't have been the truth,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Willey's accusations were taken up by Starr in his
investigation of alleged efforts by Clinton to interfere with
attorneys for Paula Jones, the former Arkansas state employee whose
sexual harassment case against the president was settled last
November.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steele's testimony was the latest twist in a trial that has
veered from the simple facts of Ms. McDougal's admitted, repeated
refusal to cooperate with a Virginia grand jury to a lengthy
examination of her motives for doing so. The defendant has insisted
that she feared a perjury indictment by Starr had she testified
before the grand jury without accusing the president or Mrs.
Clinton. In return, Ms. McDougal testified, the prosecutors
promised lenient treatment for her 1996 fraud conviction in the
Whitewater trial.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have sought to convince the jury not only that Ms.
McDougal's anxieties were contrived, but that she had information
relevant to the investigation unobtainable by any means other than
her cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. has allowed Ms.
McDougal's attorney, Mark J. Geragos, to attempt to develop
``prosecutorial misconduct'' as a defense.
</P>
<P>
   That approach revealed, at one point in the trial, that a senior
aide to Starr had drafted an indictment naming Hillary Clinton even
without Ms. McDougal's testimony. And an FBI accountant assigned to
Starr conceded that no physical evidence could be found to tie the
president to improper transactions that are the core of the
Whitewater investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steele was the latest in a series of defense witnesses to
complain that Starr's staff relied on heavy-handed tactics. She
testified Friday that federal agents assigned to Starr questioned
her adoption of a Romanian orphan, interviewed many of her friends
and relatives, including her daughter, and subpoenaed documents
from her accountant.
</P>
<P>
   Under vigorous cross-examination by Associate Independent
Counsel Julie L. Myers, Ms. Steele acknowledged receiving $12,000
for selling a photograph of Clinton, Ms. Willey and a third person
to three publications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were you proud of selling the picture,'' Ms. Myers asked
pointedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. I was ashamed,'' Ms. Steele replied.
</P>
<P>
   With equal firmness, Ms. Steele denied having expressed fears of
reprisal from the White House had she not changed her story before
the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not afraid of the White House or anyone connected with
them,'' she said.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A winter storm warning was in effect Thursday night for the
mountains of Arizona as a potent Pacific disturbance approached
from the southwest. On Friday, the disturbance will move over the
central Plains, where the risk of powerful thunderstorms will rise.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of showers and thunderstorms will develop across parts
of Nebraska and Kansas as the arriving disturbance lifts
increasingly moist air streaming north from the Gulf of Mexico. A
few of these storms could approach severe levels, with hail and
high winds possible. Storms will then move eastward into parts of
Iowa and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, isolated, powerful thunderstorms will erupt
across the high plains of western Oklahoma and western Texas as a
dry line, which will mark the boundary between very humid air from
the Gulf of Mexico and dry air from the Rockies, arrives Friday
afternoon. Farther east, a second ribbon of moisture-laden air from
the Gulf of Mexico will fuel showers and thunderstorms from eastern
Texas and Louisiana to the middle Mississippi and lower Ohio
Valleys.
</P>
<P>
   Snow will intensify across parts of the northern Plains Friday
night as the disturbance arrives from the central Plains.
Moderately heavy snow is possible in parts of the western Dakotas,
southeast Montana and northeast Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean winds blowing over cold Atlantic waters will chill parts
of southeast New England. Meanwhile, in the wake of a front
stalling across the northern Middle Atlantic states, stubborn low
clouds and patchy drizzle will dampen parts of Pennsylvania and New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Sandstorm
</P>
<P>
   Fierce winds gusted as high as 100 mph across parts of northeast
Arizona on Wednesday, kicking up dust and sand while dramatically
and dangerously lowering visibility. Related auto accidents claimed
two lives. The raging sandstorm developed as a sharp cold front
swept across the Southwest states. Behind the front, momentum from
strong winds several thousand feet aloft mixed toward the ground.
These sandstorms are sometimes called haboobs, deriving from the
Arabic word habb, which means wind. Haboobs sometimes have a wall
of swirling dust and sand that is 3,000 feet high.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senior Clinton administration officials say the
United States will have to consider accepting some of the hundreds
of thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees who have fled Kosovo in
recent days, if only to encourage reluctant European nations to do
the same.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most conservative figures released by relief
organizations describe nothing short of a disaster along Kosovo's
borders, with the U.N. High Commission for Refugees estimating that
more than 79,000 refugees poured into Macedonia, Albania and
Montenegro on Thursday alone.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said Friday that it had received ``chilling
reports'' that an additional 200,000 people were being held in the
vicinity of the train station in Pristina, the provincial capital
of Kosovo, in preparation for a forced evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has demanded that the refugees be allowed to
return to their homes immediately and that President Slobodan
Milosevic abandon his brutal policy of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that what Milosevic wants to do is to keep
the land of Kosovo and rid it of its people,'' President Clinton
said Friday. ``We cannot let that happen with impunity.''
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials say they must plan for the
likelihood that most of the Kosovo Albanians will not be able to
return home anytime soon, and that they may remain wards of the
United States and its European allies indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Relief organizations in the United States said Friday that they
were pressuring the White House to make a public statement soon
raising the possibility that some of the refugees now crowding
along Kosovo's borders would be accepted into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The statement is needed, they said, to blunt the possibility
that other European nations would follow the lead of Germany, which
suggested Thursday that it was unwilling to offer asylum to any of
the Kosovo Albanians. The German deputy foreign minister said the
refugees should remain in the Balkans and not resettle in any part
of ``Western or Northern'' Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. has traditionally offered refuge, and we have the
resources to offer refuge,'' said Robert Carey, vice president of
resettlement for the International Rescue Committee in New York.
``We have to say that this is at least being considered by the U.S.
Whether we like it or not, the United States sets an example that
is followed by other nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials say an announcement that the
United States was willing to accept some of the refugees streaming
out of Kosovo would be premature and that the administration does
not want to undermine its central message to Milosevic: that the
refugees must be allowed to return home immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they said a plan to resettle at least some of the
refugees in the United States _ and much larger numbers in Western
Europe _ would have to be considered seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question we're going to be asked, and it would be very
difficult for the United States to say you do this _ you take these
people in _ but we're not going to,'' said a State Department
official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Congress has imposed a ceiling of 78,000 on the number of
refugees who can be admitted to the United States from all nations
this year. A spokeswoman for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service said that 25,000 of those slots, or about a third of the
total, had been set aside for refugees from the Balkans. Of that,
9,300 had been set aside for refugees from Yugoslavia and its
former republics.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Friday that while it would be
difficult to persuade Congress to raise the overall ceiling for
refugees, the administration could admit several thousand Kosovo
Albanians to the United States by cutting the number of refugees
admitted from other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department announced Friday that Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott would travel to the Balkans this weekend to
urge nations in the region to accept refugees arriving from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not trying to resettle these people but hold them
temporarily in the region,'' said James Rubin, the department
spokesman. ``We are obviously working in a variety of ways with all
the front-line states.'' Talbott, he said, would ``try to encourage
everybody to do their part.''
</P>
<P>
   The department said it was also urging the Justice Department to
allow Kosovars already in the United States to remain here for at
least another year under a program in which they are granted
so-called temporary protective status and allowed to work. They
have been eligible for asylum under the program since last June.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department said Friday that it was preparing to step
up humanitarian aid to Kosovo refugees, with an immediate shipment
of 500,000 prepackaged meals to Albanians, and with tents, blankets
and medicine to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced earlier this week that he had approved an
additional $50 million in emergency aid to the refugees, raising
the total humanitarian aid package for Kosovo this year to $150
million. More than 400,000 Kosovars had been displaced from their
homes even before the exodus that began late last month.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Schwartz, the director of humanitarian affairs for the
National Security Council, reminded reporters at the White House
Friday that ``while the pictures of the suffering in Kosovo have
dominated the media over the past nine days, the suffering _ and in
particular, the terrible and large-scale population displacements
due to the horrors perpetrated by the Serb forces _ have been under
way for over a year.''

NATO SLAMS GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS IN BELGRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO launched the first, dramatic assault Friday on
downtown Belgrade, as American missiles rocked key government
headquarters, including the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of
Interior Affairs, the Serb police agency that has masterminded and
carried out much of the murderous rampage against ethnic Albanian
civilians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Huge fires engulfed the sprawling buildings after nighttime
blasts shook the Yugolsav capital, which has become a symbol of
contempt for the NATO siege against President Slobodan Milosevic's
campaign of ``ethnic cleansing'' _ forced expulsions of ethnic
Albanians from the separatist Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
   The missile attacks, aimed at ratcheting up pressure against the
defiant Milosevic by ripping apart the heart of his hometown, came
amid new reports by NATO and American intelligence sources of the
alliance's failure to thwart the continuing murders and evictions
of Kosavar civilians by marauding Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   The reports indicate Milosevic is close to achieving his goal of
ridding Kosovo of ethnic Albanians, who account for 90 percent of
the province's 1.8 million population. When his objectives are
accomplished, Milosevic is expected to call for a new coalition
government in the province, forcing NATO to reconsider the bombing
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, facing increasing public criticism
over the deepening crisis in Kosovo, recently won approval for the
pinpoint strikes in central Belgrade over the objections of several
NATO members, notably Greece and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite-guided missiles, which can be launched by B-52
bombers or Navy vessels, struck not far from Milosevic's
presidential palace. NATO officials indicated more attacks are
expected during the weekend, as calls by the Vatican for an Easter
ceasefire were rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're striking at targets he uses to control the forces
responsible for ethnic cleansing in Kosovo,'' said Pentagon
spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours before the missile strike, the Kosovo crisis
deteriorated on several critical fronts, as heavy clouds continued
to stymie much of NATO's attack plan, the Serb purge of Kosavar
civilians heightened desperation throughout the Balkans, and the
fate of three captive American soliders grew disturbingly
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a massive, 10-day aerial assault, frustrated NATO
officials said the Serbs remain undeterred in their violent
crackdown on Kosovo, which has driven an estimated 634,000 ethnic
Albanian civilians from their homes. Communities throughout the
province have turned into ``ghost towns,'' said NATO spokesman
Jamie Shea.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 200,000 refugees have fled Kosovo since the NATO
campaign began March 24, and there were reports Friday that Serb
troops have herded an additional 20,000 civilians to a train
station in Pristina to be forcibly exiled.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, for the first time since the
airstrikes began, acknowledged it was not fully prepared for the
crisis. ``I don't think anyone could have foreseen the breadth of
this brutality,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   Women, children and elderly men account for the overwhelming
majority of the refugees. NATO officials said they suspect that
military-aged ethnic Albanian men who have not been executed are
being imprisoned in stadiums or dressed in Serb uniforms and used
as human shields at military bases.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pledged an aggressive response to the burgeoning
humanitarian disaster in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   But several other developments raised concern about the possible
need for NATO ground troops, including reports that Milosevic is
planning a military coup in the Yugolsav republic of Montenegro.
State Department spokesman James Rubin also said the Serb military
has largely dismantled the Kosovo Liberation Army, the only force
that had provided any ground resistance to Milosevic's alleged
campaign of ethnic cleansing and genocide.
</P>
<P>
   The news came amid growing criticism in Congress of the NATO
campaign and a new declaration by Clinton that the United States
remains fully committed to the current strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognized when we started that this air campaign would not
be a week-or-two operation,'' Clinton said at the White House. ``We
must be determined, we must be persistent, we must be patient if we
expect to see this mission through.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the possible use of ground troops, Clinton said, ``I
still believe that we have a good possibility of achieving our
mission with the means that we have deployed.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's assessment left open the door to a possible
ground war in Kosovo, even as administration officials coped with
the unsettling task of conceding they remain in the dark about
three Army soldiers who were captured by Serb troops near the
border between Kosovo and Macedonia. ``We know precious little,''
Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   A Yugoslav judge ordered the first phase of a criminal inquiry
involving the prisoners, amid reports that the soldiers could be
charged with ``waging aggression,'' which carries a 15-year prison
term.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration assailed the proceeding as a
``kangaroo court,'' and relayed a demand through Swedish diplomats
that Milosevic permit the Red Cross to visit the captives: Staff
Sgt. Andrew Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles; Staff Sgt. Christopher
Stone, 25 of Smiths Creek, Mich., and Specialist Steven Gonzales,
21, of Huntsville, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic gave no response. And despite reports that the Serbs
would allow the soldiers to call their families, no calls were
received.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said the Pentagon has yet to formally determine whether
the soldiers, part of a reconnaissance team, were abducted during a
peacekeeping mission in Macedonia and were patrolling in the Kosovo
war zone.

UMILE, UNH A PERFECT FIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Dick Umile, traveling salesman. Traveling
apparel salesman, to be precise.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, just doesn't fit.
</P>
<P>
   Not even close. No offense to the profession, but it's not Dick
Umile. No way.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Umile knew it. His family knew it. Undoubtedly the late Bob
Kullen, then the hockey coach at the University of New Hampshire,
knew it when he invited Umile to join his staff in Durham prior to
the 1988 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me, `What do you think I should do?' '' said Rose,
his wife since after their sophomore years at UNH. ``I said, `What
are you, nuts? This has been your dream forever, to go back to
coach at UNH. If you say no, you may never get the chance again.'
''
</P>
<P>
   He said yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I got back for real cheap money, let me tell you,'' Umile
was saying Friday after a ceremony to honor Hobey Baker Award
winner Jason Krog. ``But it was at UNH. The only way I would have
come back (to college hockey) was to UNH.''
</P>
<P>
   Umile, 50, played at Melrose (Mass.) High School and then at UNH
and was the head coach at Watertown High for 10 years before
joining Mike McShane as an assistant at Providence College. He left
Providence to take the job selling clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of my family, marriage, stuff like that,'' Umile said.
</P>
<P>
   To be home more. To have a more regular schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't seem like it was him, to not be doing hockey,'' said
Kristin Haggerty, 28 and the oldest of three Umile daughters.
``Hockey is just a part of him.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday night, Katie Umile, 22, was in a bind. She was in
California and the UNH hockey team was in Worcester playing
Michigan for a spot in the NCAA Final Four in Anaheim. And Katie
couldn't find the game on television. Couldn't get a score. Didn't
know if her father and his team were headed west, or were done for
the year.
</P>
<P>
   So she called her grandmother, Gloria Umile, who was home in
Melrose watching on TV while the rest of the family was at the
game. Called from a restaurant. Collect.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was crying,'' Katie said. ``She could barely tell me what
had happened. Then she said they won and that everyone was
standing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Umile grandparents, Gloria, 76, and Jim, 80, are back East
now and Dick talked with them after UNH's win over Michigan State
Thursday night. Friday, Gloria Umile called.
</P>
<P>
   ``She called at 5:30 this morning,'' Kristin Umile said. ``She
just couldn't wait to talk to us. She's his biggest fan. She was
crying. She's always crying. And my grandfather is like the mayor
of UNH. He goes to all the games there. He knows everyone there. He
loves it.''
</P>
<P>
   Proud parents. Passionate parents.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise there.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Umile is nothing if not passionate. Passionate about
family. Friends. His teams. The sport. UNH.
</P>
<P>
   And tough. He can be more bite-your-head-off than sound bite.
He's tough and competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Gordie Clark, a teammate at UNH and now the director of player
personnel with the New York Islanders, recalls Umile popping his
shoulder back in on the Wildcat bench.
</P>
<P>
   Watch him on the bench, said Ralph Cox, the leading scorer in
UNH history and a part-time scout for the Pittsburgh Penguins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick Umile is absolutely one of the best coaches in hockey,''
he said. ``I think what he does that a lot of coaches miss is that
during the game he has a strong emotional commitment. As a player,
you recognize that. On the bench, you see him walk down and talk to
players before they go on or after they come off. A lot of coaches
do the Xs and Os during the week and then get emotionally attached
to the referee or something during the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Time was, when Umile was maybe too emotional on the bench and in
the locker room. Too wound up; his players too much on edge.
</P>
<P>
   The same was true of Shawn Walsh, Umile's most fierce rival and
the coach of the Maine team that UNH faces for a national
championship Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shawn used to be the same way,'' said Bruce Crowder, once an
assistant under Walsh at Maine and now the coach at Northeastern.
``I can remember going down on the bench to Shawn and saying,
`Shawn, you're starting to make me nervous and I've been in a few
games. How do you think these kids are feeling.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was the heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, UNH beat the Massachusetts one night at the
Whittemore Center in the first round of the Hockey East playoffs.
Late that night, when he sat down to watch the game on tape, Umile
suffered a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   He gave up smoking and a family tradition _ fried meatballs
_changed his other dietary habits, and took up the exercise bike.
And adjusted his approach a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's mellowed in the right ways,'' said Brian McCloskey, one
of Umile's assistants. ``He's learned that if the edge is off, it's
OK. He doesn't feel like he emotionally needs to drive the kids. He
lets the kids provide the emotion. I think the kids have picked up
on that. If you're unsettled on the bench, your kids will become
unsettled.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as anything, Umile feels, he has changed as he becomes
more experienced.
</P>
<P>
   Back when he returned to UNH, he and Kullen were going to try
and turn the program around. But Kullen, who had had a heart
transplant, was ill and died early in the 1990 season. Umile took
over as head coach. UNH, which had closed out the 1980s with five
straight losing seasons, has now been to the NCAA tournament five
times in the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, UNH made it to the Final Four for the first time
since 1982. Saturday the Wildcats play in their first championship
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little bit more under control,'' Umile said. ``I let the
guys play. When I first got in there I probably put a little bit
more heat on the guys. You're more demanding. Now, I try to let
them play.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One thing that hasn't changed much is Umile's ability to fire up
the troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``He starts talking about UNH and UNH hockey and the pride of
wearing the shirt,'' McCloskey said. ``He's a competitor, no
question about it. You see it and you wouldn't want to get in his
way. And I'm telling you the guys pick right up on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, a sophomore when Umile was captain, remembers well
watching him get the boys going.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the type of person who knew exactly what to say at the
right time,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   UNH defenseman and assistant captain Steve O'Brien plays his
last game for Umile and UNH Saturday. He, too, says Umile has
changed and grown as a coach in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   And he figures the coach will have some words of wisdom, maybe
some new ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``He bleeds blue,'' O'Brien said Friday. ``He'll do anything for
us. He'll be ready to go. . . . You get chills because he's so into
it. You think you're up for the game and he's way up for the game.
It's unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Umile, hockey coach. That's better.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There has been fog and rain over Yugoslavia for
most of NATO's 10-day air campaign, but politicians and their
assessment of public sensitivities have grounded just as many
bombing runs as has the weather.
</P>
<P>
   The allies' initial stated goal of stopping Serb forces that are
attacking ethnic Albanians, could have been approached in three
ways, whether the targets are tanks or supply depots:
</P>
<P>
   _ NATO can launch satellite-steered missiles from ships or
planes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fighter bombers, including F-15Es and F-117s, can attack from
high altitudes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Or tank-killing A-10s can barrel in low and shoot up armor
columns with fearsome cannons and rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Foul weather, while not hampering cruise missile strikes, has
put a serious crimp in the high-flying jets, which need to see
their targets clearly to guide the bombs precisely.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to warplanes going in low, slow and hard,
American political leaders from President Clinton on down have
reined in commanders, fearing downed planes and casualties.
</P>
<P>
   On several occasions, military officials said, field commanders
thought the military risk of low-flying attacks was acceptable,
only to be overruled by their civilian bosses who were driven by
what they perceive to be the political risks of losing an aircraft
and its pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO military commander, has tried to
work around the elements _ and the politics _ by asking Washington
and other NATO nations for Apache helicopter gunships and batteries
of field artillery and long-range rockets. But for other political
reasons, the request is snarled here and in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect military commanders are somewhat frustrated over the
limitations that are being put on them,'' said Gen. Charles Horner,
a retired Air Force officer who directed the 1991 Persian Gulf air
war. ``Quite frankly, it's gradualism versus overwhelming force.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the air campaign began, NATO's political leaders had
taken steps to crimp its scope. They established strict limits on
what risks pilots could take and how narrowly the targets had to be
defined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any military action involves balancing the need to strike
targets quickly with the need to do it in a way that is safe as
possible to the pilots,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said
Friday. ``We want to keep the risk as acceptable as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The intersection of those restrictions with the weather has
forced commanders to cancel about 20 percent of their ground-attack
missions, the Pentagon said Friday, although other officials that
ratio is closer to half of all the combat flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous,'' said one Air Force officer involved in the
Balkans policy. ``This whole mindset of losing pilots is hurting
our ability to roll them back and use the full capability of air
power.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the technological advances of American stealthy
fighters, laser-guided bombs and satellite-steered missiles, all of
them intended to inflict maximum damage on an adversary with
minimal risk to pilots, the elements can upset that balance
relatively easily.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it should surprise military commanders. Virtually every
prolonged aerial campaign in Europe in World War II was hampered by
fog and rain, said Michael S. Sherry, a military historian at
Northwestern University. High-altitude B-29 bombing runs over Japan
were buffeted by the jet stream, forcing the warplanes to adopt
low-altitude, night raids, Sherry said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Balkans, clouds have blocked pilots from beaming their
lasers to targets on the ground to guide bombs to their targets.
Pilots can drop unguided bombs, as B-1 bombers did on Thursday,
hitting a staging area for troops, but that poses greater risks to
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   On only one day in the past 10 have pilots had optimal
conditions for bombing _ a cloud ceiling of at least 25,000 feet
and visibility of more than five miles. ``The weather has been
lousy, and that has had a big impact on the number of strikes we've
been able to carry out,'' Bacon said.

 (Eds: SUBS 7th graf to change bombing to airstrikes.)  (rk) 
 By   ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ U.S. policy toward the terrorism of Slobodan
Milosevic has been constrained in the past by our public's wariness
of military involvement abroad. We remember Vietnam and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   But that political-psychological calculus may have changed, I
believe, under the impact of the Serbian atrocities in Kosovo. Most
Americans do not want to temporize with Milosevic. We want to
finish the job.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in his CBS interview with Dan Rather the
other night, said he ``would urge the American people ... to have a
little more resolve here.'' But the people are looking to the
president for resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Those terrified women and children stumbling out of Kosovo are
on our conscience now. When Rather observed in the interview that
Milosevic was winning in Kosovo, Clinton replied, ``We knew that
that would happen in the first few days.'' If he knew, why weren't
he and NATO prepared to act much more decisively?
</P>
<P>
   Decisiveness and commitment are crucial now. If we let Milosevic
complete his ethnic cleansing and genocide in Kosovo, it will be
the greatest human catastrophe in Europe since World War II. And it
will be the end of belief in NATO, a belief that has kept the peace
in Europe for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   These are among the steps that the United States and its allies
must take:
</P>
<P>
   1. Commit ourselves to the total destruction of Milosevic's
armed forces, no matter how long it takes. NATO bombers in the
first week carried out daily only a fraction of the sorties
undertaken in the Persian Gulf War. The intensity should be at
least as high as in the gulf, and this time the equivalent of
Saddam Hussein's Republican Guard must not escape. The airstrikes
in Belgrade must mean the targeting of command and control centers.
We should also quickly hit Yugoslav broadcasting facilities, a key
factor in Milosevic's power.
</P>
<P>
   2. Prepare to send NATO ground troops into Kosovo as a
protection force for the ethnic Albanians who have not yet been
murdered or expelled. Ten thousand troops can be there within days.
Others must follow as needed, perhaps 20,000 to 40,000.
</P>
<P>
   3. Begin supplying weapons to the Kosovo Liberation Army. This
cannot be a short-run answer to the Milosevic policemen and
paramilitaries who are terrorizing civilians; even getting guns to
the KLA will be difficult. But we have to start enabling the
victims to protect themselves.
</P>
<P>
   4. Announce that the United States and its allies are abandoning
the plan for Kosovo ``autonomy'' that was on the table in the
failed negotiations in Rambouillet, France. Milosevic's cruelties
have ended any possibility of Kosovars being ruled by Serbia. For
the next several years Kosovo should be policed and controlled
internationally.
</P>
<P>
   5. Commit the alliance to the return of all refugees to Kosovo.
The international community will have to feed and house them until
their homes and villages are rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   6. Call on the International War Crimes Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia to indict Milosevic and all others involved in his
crimes against humanity in Kosovo. The tribunal's prosecutors have
been remiss in not building a case against him long before now, for
the crimes he directed in Bosnia; and the U.S. government has
failed to give the tribunal the large amount of evidence it has
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Those commitments must be believed _ by Milosevic and by the
people of the United States and the other NATO countries. That
means that there can be no bombing pauses to let Milosevic reflect,
no return to fruitless diplomacy. Our terms must be clear and
unchanging.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has bet again and again that the United States does
not have the backbone to stand up against his viciousness and
guile. So far he has won. If he wins again, the price to this
country and the Western alliance will be devastating.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton is the man who has to prove that Milosevic is
wrong. If he speaks firmly and consistently, if he acts decisively,
he will have the support of the American people _ and of Congress.
Senate Republicans who matter, from John McCain to Richard Lugar,
are urging him to be tough.
</P>
<P>
   If Americans had the illusion that peace and human decency can
be defended in this world without pain and casualties, the illusion
is fading. What we need now is leadership.

MARKET WATCH: EVEN WAR CAN'T SHAKE `WHAT-ME-WORRY?' WALL STREET 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, April 4) 
(bl) 
By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was the subject of considerable head-scratching
among investors last week that even as the Dow Jones industrial
average was closing above 10,000 for the first time, an already
grim situation in Kosovo was getting worse. While the euro tumbled
on bulletins from the front, the Dow ended the week up 10 points,
at 9,832.51. Its relative ebullience in the face of horrors
overseas seemed oddly disconnected, at best.
</P>
<P>
   Investors seem happy to shrug off the Kosovo conflict as one
that will be contained, both geographically and economically. That
may be so, but this wishful thinking is but one example of how
cavalier investors are today. Only when trouble hits them in the
face do they react and dump stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the data on Wednesday from the Commerce Department,
which showed a growing economy producing smaller corporate profits.
While the economy grew almost 4 percent last year, profits fell 2.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   One might think that with the overall market trading at a rich
34 times earnings, plunging profits would frighten investors. But
the Dow only hiccuped, falling 1.3 percent on the day of the news,
then recovering a bit the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Unfailing optimism is a splendid and very American trait. It is
also a result of a long bull market. If stocks rise inexorably,
many believe, there's no need to sweat the details.
</P>
<P>
   But what many investors have forgotten is that attention to
detail can sometimes signal a timely exit, before pie hits face.
</P>
<P>
   An example? Dell Computer, until recently a member of the
stocks-that-only-go-up club. Now, after two disappointing quarters,
investors are starting to question Dell's prospects; the shares are
down almost 25 percent from their highs.
</P>
<P>
   What's been plaguing Dell's shares recently does not qualify as
news. Watchful investors have known for months that Dell's
dominance in the mail-order personal computer business is under
attack from Compaq and IBM, which have begun selling their products
directly to customers as well. And it is no mystery that the only
real growth in PC sales today is among computers that sell for
$1,000 or less. Dell's products carry much higher prices _ on
average more than $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Another case of investors with their heads in the sand involved
Coca-Cola, a former highflier that is 19 percent off its recent
peak. The company shocked Wall Street when it warned on Monday that
first-quarter global sales would drop 1 percent to 2 percent. In
the days following the news, Coca-Cola's shares fell 6.7 percent.
With most of the world's economies contracting, why a sales decline
surprised investors is a conundrum indeed.
</P>
<P>
   What would it take to make investors pay closer heed to the
various straws in the wind? A series of scandals, said Richard
Sylla, professor of financial and economic history at New York
University's Stern School of Business. ``If you get several
Sunbeams and Cendants, then people may begin to say, `This is not
real,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, investors who have kept buying stocks in the
face of troubling fundamentals are likely to do some damage to the
overall market when they finally head for the exits. As the handful
of popular companies that are still moving up gets smaller, it
grows less likely that these stocks can hold up the market
averages. And unless the former favorites are replaced by other
stocks with fabulous prospects, the indexes could be in for a
tumble.

WHEN AN ANNUAL REPORT IS HAZARDOUS TO YOUR HEALTH

<P>
   Another day, another new mutual fund. The number of fund
offerings has exploded in recent years, and the excuses that fund
companies give for starting them grow flimsier each day. More and
more portfolios are tied to eccentric stock indexes, obscure
industry subsectors and ever more esoteric investing styles. The
logical end? Following are excerpts from an imaginary annual
report:
</P>
<P>
   We at the Dysgenic Family of Funds share your disappointment
with our 1998 performance _ even as we remain confident that the
stellar returns of our index funds, which came close to matching
their appropriate benchmarks if sales loads, 12b-1 fees and
management expenses are ignored, amply illustrate the rewards of
patience.
</P>
<P>
   The growing interest in index investing, in fact, has prompted
Dysgenic to re-examine its offerings in this arena. After all,
investment professionals rightly caution that a single index fund
does not a balanced portfolio make.
</P>
<P>
   To help investors round out their holdings, we have developed a
variety of new index funds that nicely complement the old standbys.
They include these:
</P>
<P>
   THE BYPASS FUND invests 95 percent of its assets in a basket of
stocks that passively seeks to mimic returns of the little-known
Cholesterol Index, as developed by the Poughkeepsie Mercantile
Board. The fund's top 10 holdings for the most recent quarter
included perennial favorites like Outback Steakhouse, McDonald's
and RJR Nabisco, as well as firms engaged in the business of
providing cholesterol-control drugs, surgical devices and mortuary
services. The fund recently won approval from shareholders to
establish selected short positions, the biggest of which involves
the Roughage Company, a Midwestern chain of salad bars. The fund
believes Roughage is poised for hard times as freedom-loving
Americans throw off the stigma recently associated with charred
meat.
</P>
<P>
   THE MENCKEN FUND invests in the so-called Las Vegas 40 Index,
comprised of companies that subscribe to the theories of the late
investment guru H.L. Mencken (``Nobody ever went broke
underestimating the taste of the American public.'') The LV40
includes Bantam Rising Inc., a fast-growing maker of elevator
shoes; Foment + Mendacity Syndications, one of Hollywood's leading
distributors of daytime television, and the Veblenesque Tchotchke
Company, the world's leading maker and marketer of fine
collectibles.
</P>
<P>
   THE HOMEWORK FUND, which invests in a worldwide index of
companies weighted according to the performance of each country's
secondary school students on annual examinations of reading and
mathematics literacy. This is an enhanced index fund; it exercises
discretion in allocating a portion of its assets. Thus the fund's
management, in an effort to anticipate future market movements,
closely analyzes the results of similar tests administered to
elementary school children. (A special note: because of the
consistently poor performance of American students, the fund is a
good way to diversify overseas without abandoning the discipline of
indexing.) N addition to our index offerings, the Dysgenic Family
includes a number of new, actively managed investment vehicles, as
well as some proven funds with records dating back even before
1996:
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most noteworthy is the IMBROGLIO FUND, whose board
announced recently that it had reopened to new investors. Aimed at
those whose tolerance for risk is much greater than their interest
in profits, the fund seeks out investments that the fund's
management considers likely to be affected by class action and
other lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   In the last several years, the fund has established short
positions in tobacco, breast implants, lids for takeout coffee cups
and, more recently, gun manufacturers. To help it discover new
opportunities, the fund retains a contingent of lawyers who provide
pro bono assistance to litigants wronged, or allegedly wronged, by
publicly traded companies. (The fund anticipates working closely
with management of the new Bypass Fund.)
</P>
<P>
   Under its manager, Taylor Imbroglio, the fund has performed in
the top 75 percent of nondiversified, litigation-oriented funds for
the period from April 23, 1996, to Sept. 7, 1998, not counting the
cost of judgments against the fund's assets arising from the
day-to-day course of its activities.
</P>
<P>
   Imbroglio is confident that the largest of these judgments will
be reversed on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Also of interest to investors in pursuit of high returns is the
new PETRI-BUNSEN.COM VALUE FUND, which seeks to harness two of the
day's most powerful investment trends: biotechnology stocks and the
Internet. Although the universe of companies simultaneously in both
businesses is fairly small as this report goes to press, the fund's
management believes that its exponential growth is likely to reward
patient investors who seek opportunity before the thundering herd
tramples in after them.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the fund's most promising holding is Virulax, which
makes and markets viruses for sale over the Internet, and the
American depository receipts of Anthrax.net, a Cayman Islands
concern in a similar business. It should be noted that Anthrax.net
exemplifies the power of the Internet when combined with biological
technologies, in that it does a growing global business with just a
handful of employees, using the new medium to leverage its scant
assets into worldwide sales.
</P>
<P>
   The Dysgenic Family also wishes to elaborate on its reasons for
closing its most popular offering, the THONG FUND, to new investors
as of March 1.
</P>
<P>
   The family's leading performer the last two years, the Thong
Fund invests in companies that stand to benefit from Presidential
philandering, partisan politics and governmental gridlock. Top
holdings include firms specializing in DNA testing, as well as
publishers of tabloid newspapers and providers of temporary
staffing services to the offices of independent counsels.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the fund has led to a ballooning of assets, which
management believes could be detrimental to the interests of
existing shareholders. Management wishes to emphasize that past
performance is no guarantee of future results, as there can be no
assurance that Presidential behavior, the legal and regulatory
climates and other factors will continue to provide favorable
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the performance of the fund for the most recent
quarter will be adversely impacted by the purchase of key-man
insurance coverage on the lives of Monica Lewinsky, Kenneth Starr
and Barbara Walters.
</P>
<P>
   Investors should also note that the venerable BUTKUS FUND, named
in honor of the defensive great of the Chicago Bears, is being
dissolved in the wake of a successful proxy campaign on the part of
dissident shareholders to change the fund's name.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bearish, defensive portfolio strategy of the fund
has been unfashionable for most of its 15 years of existence
(leading to its negative returns in that period), management of the
fund said in a statement that it ``regretted'' the new name, the
CUSTER FUND.
</P>
<P>
   The statement also lamented that ``the prevailing quick-buck
mentality of the stock market has made our remaining investors
insufficiently patient to stay with us even as events have begun to
prove our outlook correct in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We remain confident, however, that when the history of mutual
funds is written, the Butkus philosophy will be vindicated.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO attacked the center of Yugoslavia's capital
Friday night, destroying two government buildings in Belgrade in
what senior officials here described as the start of an intensified
campaign to wreck President Slobodan Milosevic's military
hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   A barrage of eight cruise missiles _ fired from American
warships and a British submarine in the Adriatic _ struck after
midnight in Belgrade, or 6 p.m. ET, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon refused to disclose the targets hit Friday night,
but flames raged from two buildings near the Sava River in
Belgrade's core, the federal Ministry for Internal Affairs and the
Ministry of Interior. The buildings house the headquarters of the
paramilitary police forces that have orchestrated Milosevic's
yearlong crackdown against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in 10 days of attacks that NATO had struck
the center of Belgrade, a once-thriving capital that has slowly
withered under years of economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation
caused by Milosevic's policies.
</P>
<P>
   Although previous attacks battered military targets on
Belgrade's edges, the missiles Friday night struck with a
thunderous clap that shook the entire capital. Within minutes of
the first explosion, an enormous arc of flames soared hundreds of
feet into the air.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of casualties from Friday night's strikes was not
immediately clear, but the attack occurred in the middle of the
night, at a time when the buildings would presumably have few
people in them.
</P>
<P>
   The two buildings are close to other government buildings,
including a hospital. But it appeared that the cruise missiles _
each with a 1,000-pound warhead _ struck their targets with
pinpoint precision, leaving other buildings nearby still standing.
But Yugoslavia's deputy prime minister, Vuk Draskovic, said there
were ``many, many victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Militarily and psychologically, the strikes represented a
serious escalation of NATO's attack on Yugoslavia, making good on
the warning by NATO's commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, that there
would be ``no sanctuary'' for Yugoslavia's political and military
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week NATO gave Clark the authority to expand the
raids beyond strictly military targets in or near Kosovo. On
Thursday American F-15s destroyed a bridge over the Danube River in
the city of Novi Sad, and Pentagon and NATO officials have vowed
that more bridges and other targets in cities would be pounded as
long as Milosevic continued his repression in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's strikes came after nine previous days of bombing
had made only measured progress in slowing Milosevic's onslaught
against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Refugees continued to pour from
Kosovo into Albania and Macedonia, telling stories of atrocities
and forced expulsions from villages, towns and cities throughout
the province.
</P>
<P>
   The mushrooming humanitarian crisis along Kosovo's border _
where thousands of refugees have gathered, short of food and
shelter _ has put new pressure on the United States and NATO to
intensify its campaign, even if that meant considering the use of
ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, facing sharp questions at the White House,
appealed for patience and expressed confidence that an air campaign
alone would be able to achieve NATO's military and political
objectives in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have strong allied unity,'' Clinton said. ``We have real
firm determination today in Europe that these objectives will be
achieved and we intend to stay after them until they are.''

SHELDON KOPP, 70, PSYCHOLOGIST WHO WROTE ABOUT SELF-ESTEEM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Md., Calif., N.J.)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sheldon Bernard Kopp, a clinical psychologist and author of
books designed to bolster the reader's self-esteem, died Monday,
his 70th birthday, at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington.
He lived in nearby Silver Spring, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cardiac arrhythmia and pneumonia, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Kopp, who practiced in Washington for 35 years, wrote 17 books.
Much of his writing was meant to guide readers in finding
importance in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   A book that got much attention was ``If You Meet the Buddha on
the Road, Kill Him,'' published in 1972. Like many of the others,
it was issued by Science and Behavior Books. In the book, Kopp
analyzed the ways in which people sought to recognize significance
and value in themselves, rather than rely on gurus. The book
remains available from Bantam's New Age imprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back to One: A Practical Guide for Psychotherapists'' (1977),
``Even a Stone Can Be a Teacher'' (1985) and ``Blues Ain't Nothing
but a Good Soul Feeling Bad: Daily Steps to Spiritual Growth''
(1992) are also in print. His other titles include ``The Naked
Therapist'' (1976) and ``An End to Innocence'' (1978).
</P>
<P>
   Kopp was born in the Bronx, N.Y., and graduated from Brooklyn
College in 1951. He received a master's in 1953 and a doctorate in
1960 from the New School for Social Research, then interned and
worked in New Jersey institutions and agencies.
</P>
<P>
   He was a clinical psychologist and acting department head at
Trenton State Hospital before going to Washington in 1961. He was
the chief clinical psychologist in the District of Columbia Adult
Mental Health Clinic before going into private practice.
</P>
<P>
   Kopp is survived by his wife of 46 years, Marjorie Ice Kopp;
three sons, Jonathan, of Novato, Calif., David, of Atlantic City,
N.J., and Nicholas, of Germantown, Md., and four grandchildren.

   NEW YORK _ The previews are over and the glittering cast has
settled in for a nine-day run. It's not exactly the Great White
Way, but it's just a few long blocks from Broadway. And where else
in New York can one see so many cars that aren't yellow? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite New Yorkers' reputed preference for subway cars over
sports cars, the New York International Auto Show draws the biggest
crowds of the nation's four leading car shows. And since it is the
last of these, its displays include most of the future models and
design studies, known as concept cars, that were previously
unveiled in Detroit, Chicago and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The new-car news at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, where
the last New York auto show of the century runs through Sunday,
April 11, has been about bread-and-butter cars like a restyled Ford
Taurus and the first midsize Saturn. Still, there are plenty of
sexier models that made their debuts earlier but have not been seen
by New Yorkers, like the future Ford Thunderbird, the
Bauhaus-inspired Audi TT, the '30s-style Chrysler PT Cruiser and
the Cadillac Evoq, which heralds a new direction for General
Motors' luxury division. Among the other vehicles new to New York
are these:
</P>
<P>
   ASTON MARTIN DB7 VANTAGE
</P>
<P>
   This car's stats could have James Bond rethinking his defection
to BMW: 420 horsepower from a 6-liter V12 derived from Formula One
race cars, a top speed of 180 m.p.h. and 0-to-60 acceleration in
less than 5 seconds. Both a coupe and Volante convertible go on
sale next year; prices have not been announced.
</P>
<P>
   BMW 3-SERIES COUPES
</P>
<P>
   Following the introduction last year of all-new 3-Series sedans,
BMW has updated its 323Ci and 328Ci, which go on sale in July as
2000 models. Though the styling is similar, the two- and four-door
models share virtually no parts. BMW is also displaying a new M5,
which it calls the world's fastest production sedan, and modestly
restyled Z3 roadsters.
</P>
<P>
   CHEVROLET SUBURBAN/GMC YUKON
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, General Motors introduced completely redesigned
full-size pickups. Now it is showing prototypes of full-size sport
utilities based on that solid new truck platform. The Yukon and its
Chevy counterpart, the Tahoe, get a third-row seat _ to compete
better with the Ford Expedition _ and side air bags. Styling of the
bigger Suburban, like that of the Tahoe/Yukon, is a bit more
rounded.
</P>
<P>
   INFINITI I30
</P>
<P>
   Nissan's premium division has restyled its midsize luxury car,
based on a redesigned Nissan Maxima, for 2000. The interior is more
roomy and horsepower from the V6 is up by 37, to 227. The I30 now
offers a navigation system connected to a 24-hour response center
for emergency assistance. Other new options include Xenon headlamps
and a rear sunshade.
</P>
<P>
   KIA KMS-4
</P>
<P>
   In a demonstration that economy cars need not be dull, the South
Korean automaker showed a sharp-edged design study in the vein of
the Mercury Cougar. The KMS-4 features a glass roof and a solar
cell to power accessories. The four-passenger concept coupe has a
four-cylinder engine, transmission-shifting paddles behind the
steering wheel and a sporty suspension. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MAZDA MPV
</P>
<P>
   This minivan gets some much-needed improvements: front-wheel
drive, sharper styling, various family-friendly features. Sliding
rear doors _ with power windows, an exclusive touch _ replace
hinged doors. The second-row captain's chairs slide together to
form a bench; they also fold and can be removed. The third-row
seat, like that of the Honda Odyssey, flips into the floor. Mazda
may later add all-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   MERCEDES-BENZ CL
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz is showing its next high-end coupe for the first
time. Arriving in showrooms early next year, it will be offered as
the CL500, with a 5-liter V8; a V12 model will probably come later.
Mercedes is also displaying its flagship S-Class sedan, which is
about to go on sale. Lighter and less expensive than the previous
S-Class, the car is a technological wonder: There is a standard
navigation system, voice-recognition features and a ``smart''
cruise control that maintains a set distance behind another
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   MITSUBISHI ECLIPSE
</P>
<P>
   A new version of this sporty coupe has a low-slung front end and
prominent ribs along its sides. In keeping with the
``geo-mechanical'' design of Mitsubishi's concept cars, the Eclipse
has a machined look; the fuel filler cap, for instance, has a
riveted metallic appearance. The Eclipse goes on sale this summer.
</P>
<P>
   NISSAN Z
</P>
<P>
   Though it made its worldwide debut in Detroit in January, the Z
concept car got a big lift in New York, where Nissan announced that
it would indeed produce a new version of the classic Z sports car
within three years. Nissan insists that the next rear-drive Z will
not be retro, but will have the ``design DNA'' and reasonable price
of the original 1970 Datsun 240Z. The powertrain has not been
selected; the show car has a 200-horsepower four-cylinder engine.
</P>
<P>
   OLDSMOBILE AURORA
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since its 1994 introduction, the car that set
a new import-fighting course for Olds is being revamped. The 2001
model is styled less dramatically, in line with the less expensive
Intrigue. Smaller and 300 pounds lighter, the front-drive Aurora
will offer a V6 along with its highly regarded 250-horsepower V8.
It will go on sale in about a year.
</P>
<P>
   SAAB 9-3 VIGGEN
</P>
<P>
   This new offshoot of the 9-3 series derives its name and badge
from an aircraft, the Saab 37 Viggen jet fighter. Its 2.3-liter
four-cylinder engine has been modified to produce 225 horsepower,
and the car has a new sports suspension and performance wheels. The
coupe goes on sale in limited numbers in May; convertible and
five-door models arrive in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   SATURN L-SERIES
</P>
<P>
   Having survived its first decade with a single set of small
cars, Saturn at last adds some new models. Based on the Opel Vectra
from Germany, the midsize L-Series (for large) is available as an
LS sedan, which goes head-to-head with the Toyota Camry and Honda
Accord, or a LW station wagon. Resembling the smaller S-Series and
bearing plastic body panels like all Saturns, the L-Series offers
four-cylinder or V6 engines. The new models go on sale this summer;
prices were not announced. &QL;

 &HT;    Pope bears burden of Good Friday into Colosseum
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Pope John Paul II will drag his ailing
78-year-old body into the Roman Colosseum tonight to bring a
message of hope to the world.
</P>
<P>
   Flooded by candlelight, in solemn procession, the pontiff will
make the exhausting pilgrimage to remember the crucifixion of Jesus
_ and proclaim its promise.
</P>
<P>
   Today is the anniversary of Jesus' death, the Friday Christians
call good. The faithful believe that tragic event triggered God's
offer of salvation for all.
</P>
<P>
   In a ritual laden with symbolism, the pope will mark the last
Good Friday of the second millennium amid the ruins of a stadium
built at the dawn of the first.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:15 p.m., he will walk to the Stations of the Cross,
stopping at each of 14 small shrines in the stadium built in A.D.
72.
</P>
<P>
   The devotion recalls events in the death of Jesus. The arena is
symbolic of the empire Christianity conquered and the persecution
the faithful endured.
</P>
<P>
   At each stop, the pope will mourn Jesus' suffering 2,000 years
ago and pray for those who suffer today.
</P>
<P>
   There is a profound spiritual link between the two, according to
Bishop Anthony O'Connell of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Palm
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think that this might be the Good Friday _ with
Kosovo going on _ that there might be something to move us to be
closer to the spirit of Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Christians will seek to be near that spirit today by
walking the Stations of the Cross at services in their churches.
</P>
<P>
   Some will join processions that trace the way of the cross
through villages and towns in outdoor journeys.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous of those is the Via Dolorosa in the Old City of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Stations of the Cross is a reminder, not only of what our
Lord did, but of our willingness to walk with him and share his
victory over death,'' said the Rev. William Hamilton, rector of St.
Andrew's Episcopal Church in Lake Worth. ``It strengthens me for my
own personal journey.''
</P>
<P>
   Pilgrims to Jerusalem began to commemorate the way of the cross
as early as the fourth century. No one knew the precise path Jesus
took to the place of his crucifixion.
</P>
<P>
   But popular piety would not be denied. Pilgrims worked out
patterns to follow with stations along the way. The number varied
among different groups.
</P>
<P>
   The faithful brought the practice home to Europe by the fifth
century, according to Gary Poe, assistant professor of religion and
church historian at Palm Beach Atlantic College in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   European churches set up a devotional walk with stations for
those who could not travel to the Holy Land. By the 16th century,
the Franciscan order _ responsible for Holy Land shrines _
established what is now the traditional 14 stops.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the events recalled in the devotion are mentioned in the
Bible, but several come from pious tradition. There is no evidence
Jesus fell or that a woman, traditionally known as Veronica, wiped
his brow.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the solemn ritual has long honored these characters and
events: His trial and conviction, the three times Jesus fell under
the weight of the cross, the people, Simon, Veronica and Mary, whom
he met along the way, his crucifixion and burial.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II, with his flair for the dramatic, was the
first pope to pray the Stations of the Cross on Good Friday at the
Colosseum.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium was built at the dawn of the Christian era and is
associated with the persecution of the early church. But there is
no evidence Christians were martyred there.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the persecutions in Rome occurred before the Colosseum
was built, Poe said. Martyrs in Rome, including St. Peter, probably
died in Nero's Circus, which was once near what is today Vatican
City. Others were killed in an arena called the Circus Maximus in
Rome.
</P>
<P>
   But the Colosseum had public shows, naval battles, gladiators
fighting and is clearly associated with the martyrdom of the early
church. And that's a powerful link to Good Friday, Poe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Colosseum could have connections with martyrdom, which is
considered to be akin to the persecution of Christ,'' Poe said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Colosseum was neglected during the Middle Ages, no
doubt because there was little evidence of Christian activity
there, according to Bruce Miller, head of the religious studies
philosophy library at Catholic University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were careful to preserve martyrs' sites all over the
place,'' he said. ``They did nothing with the Colosseum.''
</P>
<P>
   By the 18th century, popular piety brought renewed attention to
the crumbling structure as a possible place of martyrdom.
</P>
<P>
   In 1750, Pope Benedict XIV ordered 14 Stations of the Cross set
up in the ruins of the Colosseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christ is the king of martyrs,'' Miller said. ``If you think
martyrdom took place there, then stations of his passion are
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence any one used them. They were torn down in
1874 by Italian troops who took Rome during the unification of
Italy, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II began what is now an annual tradition of
walking the Stations of the Cross at the ancient stadium. And, on
this day of shame and suffering, the pope shines the glare of his
fame on the shame and suffering of the world.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, he has prayed for _ and brought attention to _
the crisis in Bosnia, Chechnya, Rwanda and Somalia. Kosovo will be
on his list tonight, O'Connell said.
</P>
<P>
   Separate meditations are written each year for each station.
Orthodox Catholics, Protestants, women and people of many races and
many countries join the pope on the annual pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
   The faithful carry candles. The pope carries a small cross for
part of the journey in imitation of Jesus. He would do that longer,
but his crippled body will not cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a tough time walking,'' O'Connell said. ``But he's
going to continue as long as he can. He figures the Lord will give
him strength.''

 &HT;    Misguided groups claim Risen Lord as their tailor-made pitchman
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Poor Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Risen from the dead, he still can't escape the clutches of those
who misuse him. And they pervert the Easter proclamation that he is
Lord.
</P>
<P>
   One bizarre group insists that Jesus was a vegetarian and
argues, therefore, that everyone should be one _ as if Good Friday
and Easter Sunday existed to serve the meatless lobby.
</P>
<P>
   That's nonsense, of course, but it illustrates a dangerous,
popular _ and blasphemous _ way of treating the Risen Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Too many Christians make Jesus a pitchman for their pet slogan
and duck his clarion call to live from another reality.
</P>
<P>
   Today's astounding news is the glad shout that a servant is
Lord. A crucified Jewish carpenter _ noted for embracing the
outcast _ is raised to the right hand of God.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian New Testament insists that Jesus' unquestioned
loyalty to God is alone rewarded with eternal life. And that book
of faith invites the faithful to live as he does, not merely on
behalf of others, but specifically on behalf of others who are
unloved and powerless.
</P>
<P>
   But too often, one interest group or another demands that Jesus
be loyal to their prejudices, push their product or advocate their
narrow understanding of God's will.
</P>
<P>
   The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) are a
caricature of that dangerous tendency. They peddle their
questionable gospel of vegetarian truth by depicting Jesus, with
the halo of an orange peel, calling for a meatless kingdom. The
T-shirt is $16.50.
</P>
<P>
   The PETA Web page (www. jesus-online.com) brags that the group
is ``enlisting Jesus as it newest spokeperson ... ''
</P>
<P>
   PETA is a joke. The pattern is scary.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, good Christian folk have used the name of Jesus
to support slavery, discriminate against Jews, Protestants,
Catholics, blacks, women and, most recently, homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   They have done so in absolute contradiction of the clear will of
Jesus or in the face of his silence. And they have inflicted
enormous pain.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. J. Brabban, who teaches religion and philosophy at Palm
Beach Atlantic College in West Palm Beach, equates such behavior
with that of Judas, the apostle who betrayed Jesus with a kiss.
</P>
<P>
   Judas apparently wanted Jesus to support the zealots who were
planning armed rebellion. He tried to manipulate Jesus into being
what he, Judas, wanted him to be. Sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we try to do that, we become Judas,'' Brabban said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, nations frequently and pompously claim that the Prince of
Peace is their champion in war.
</P>
<P>
   The mess in the Balkans pits both Orthodox and Roman Catholic
Christians and a community of Muslims _ all people of the same God
_ against each other. Each believes that God is on their side,
when, no doubt, he weeps for all.
</P>
<P>
   If Jesus is misused, God is often maligned.
</P>
<P>
   Some religious separatists in Israel so twist God's word that
only the faithful who believe and behave as they do are genuinely
Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Muslims in Afghanistan make the bizarre claim that God wants
women to be uneducated, unemployed, house-bound vassals who are to
come and go in silence.
</P>
<P>
   People of good will seeking the mind of God can disagree on
tough issues such as cloning human beings, when life begins and how
it should end.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the divine will is obvious, and the model for
authentic human life is clear.
</P>
<P>
   The Muslim Koran, the Hebrew Bible and Christian Scripture
insist on the holiness of God and the dignity of the person.
</P>
<P>
   And, today, as Christians shout, ``The Lord is Risen,'' they
acknowledge a servant who died for those with little or no dignity
_ the poor and outcast.
</P>
<P>
   And they rejoice in the God who has given new and enduring life
to affirm that ministry.

AIRLINES ARE MAKING MORE MONEY AND EARNING LESS PRAISE

(DW) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   These are truly boom times for the nation's airlines: Their
earnings are stronger than ever, and they flew a record 611 million
passengers last year without a single fatality. They did so while
maintaining their on-time performance and without a significant
increase in officially registered complaints.
</P>
<P>
   So successful, and yet, by many accounts, they have never been
so unloved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you fly, the more aware you are that there's a
pattern of indifferent service,'' said Carl Hughes, the president
of Fahey Bank in Marion, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has experienced exemplary service on flights, the
bad has lately outnumbered the good, he said. For example, it took
him 23 hours to fly from Columbus, Ohio, to Belfast, Northern
Ireland, last spring, rather than the usual nine hours, because of
a series of delays, cancellations and what he said was a lack of
concern from most of the six airlines he dealt with on the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Many other travelers have tales of woe. The complaints, of
course, are not new: poor service, scant leg room, lost or
mishandled baggage, incomplete or misleading information about
delayed flights, overbooking and frustration with frequent-flier
miles that are easy to accumulate but next to impossible to use.
But recent air-travel fiascos _ the January snowstorm in Detroit
that trapped people on Northwest Airlines planes for hours and the
sick-out by pilots in February that at times caused more than half
of AMR's American Airlines' flights to be canceled _ have swung a
spotlight on passenger complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Congress and Vice President Al Gore have seized on the
issue. They have proposed doubling the maximum compensation for
being bumped from a flight, requiring that all tickets be
refundable within 48 hours of purchase and that airlines disclose
their cancellation and flight delay policies and tell how many
seats on flights are available for frequent fliers.
</P>
<P>
   They are pushing for changes even though few want a return to
full-blown airline regulation, abolished in 1978, and even though
Transportation Department statistics show that the number of
consumer complaints filed has remained steady in recent years and
was just 9,606 last year. (Critics, especially travel agents, say
few travelers bother to file complaints with the agency, which does
little more than categorize the complaints.)
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at all the numbers, I have to conclude the system
is working pretty well, considering its complexity,'' said Dean
Headley, an assistant professor of marketing at Wichita State
University in Kansas, who has analyzed the complaints filed last
year with the Transportation Department. ``The airlines do what
they promised, getting people from A to B. But passengers seem to
be saying, `We like what you do, we just don't like the way you're
doing it.'''
</P>
<P>
   In a University of Michigan nationwide survey of 2,000 adults
released &UR;  &LR; in February, airlines were ranked 31st (tied with network
broadcasters) among 34 industries in terms of customer
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, airlines are victims of their own success. More
people flying more places has taxed the air traffic control system
and jammed airports, causing bad tempers and frayed nerves.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Hallet, president of the Air Transport Association, the
trade group for 23 U.S. airlines, contends that about two-thirds of
all delays are the fault of weather and inefficiencies in the
government's air-traffic control system, which handles, on average,
21,000 flights a day. The system, she said, is inadequate to handle
the existing traffic, much less the air traffic in the next decade,
when the number of passengers is expected to rise to a billion from
611 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the industry's image continues to take a battering. At
congressional hearings last month, passengers caught by the
snowstorm in Detroit told of being forced to endure more than seven
hours trapped in a plane without food, water or usable lavatories.
Travel agents at the hearings criticized airlines for selling
tickets for flights that were already overbooked.
</P>
<P>
   Some influential lawmakers are sympathetic. Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., who is chairman of the Commerce Committee, has sponsored,
along with Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the Airline Passenger Fairness
Act, which would enable air travelers to find out whether the
flights they are booked on have been oversold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every American traveler has the right to the same kinds of
basic protections when they buy an airline ticket that they do at
the corner grocery store,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   The airline industry contends that overbooking is a response to
no-show passengers. The number of extra seats sold is not
determined arbitrarily, industry officials say, but by tracking
historical data to determine how many passengers are expected to
show up for the flight. The number of passengers bumped from
flights has declined over the last five years, according to the
Transportation Department _ to 44,797 passengers last year (or 0.87
for every 10,000 passengers) from 60,636 in 1994 (1.27 per 10,000).
</P>
<P>
   There is similar legislation being pushed in the House by
Representative Bud Shuster, R-Pa., chairman of the House
Transportation Committee. Gore has also proposed ``passenger
rights'' legislation. Among other things, the proposals would
require airlines to tell passengers when and why flights are
delayed, canceled or diverted to another airport and to provide
information about all fares, including fares offered through e-mail
and on Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington-based research
group, estimated that the proposed measure could cost airlines $6
billion in lost revenues and would result in higher fares, lower
industry efficiency and customer service. The industry earned $5.1
billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, airlines executives contend that the measures are in
large part a product of political posturing, as officials seek to
gain exposure and win votes from disgruntled air travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the airlines' trade group, the Air Transport
Association, acknowledges that the industry needs to burnish its
image. It recently pledged to make efforts to see that passengers
get timely and accurate information about flight delays and
cancellations, and that travelers be quoted the lowest fare
available for which they qualify.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely responding,'' said David Fuscus, a spokesman
for the trade group, ``as you tend to do when you have the vice
president and the head of the Senate and House committees that
oversee your industry making suggestions.''

</P>
<P>
   Pledges and statistics, however, may not be enough to assuage
some passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of what airlines or what time I fly between New
York and Los Angeles,'' said Leslie Goldman, a book editor in
Manhattan who flies regularly, ``there's always a long, long wait
to get to the terminal after we land.''
</P>
<P>
   Ihor Chyzowycg, a soccer coach in Cincinnati, was with other
coaches on a plane set to fly to Florida when the flight was
canceled. ``People at the gate told us the weather there was too
bad to land, but didn't say why we were boarded and taxied out to
the runway in the first place,'' he said. ``And after we sat in the
airport an hour, they reboarded us on another plane, and off we
went without any more talk about the weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Those kinds of experiences have fueled suspicion that the
weather and mechanical trouble are often excuses to cancel lightly
filled flights, or to double up on later flights. Airlines
vehemently deny they do that, saying even a single cancellation
ripples throughout the system and is therefore more costly than
flying a nearly empty plane.
</P>
<P>
   Such suspicions are likely to linger, as long as airports are
crowded and airplanes are cramped, some experts say. ``There seems
to be a new level of expectations,'' noted Headley of Wichita
State, ``and it isn't sinking in to the airline industry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For as good as air service is, the airlines have to understand
that perception is reality.''

 &HT;    The musical man: Stanley Donen
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Fred Astaire joyously dancing on the
walls and ceiling in ``Royal Wedding.'' Gene Kelly deliriously
splashing in the street puddles in ``Singin' in the Rain.'' Audrey
Hepburn gracefully spreading her wings and descending the stairs of
the Louvre in ``Funny Face.'' Cary Grant playfully soaping up his
wash-and-wear suit in ``Charade.'' Dudley Moore uncomfortably
jumping on a trampoline as a nun in ``Bedazzled.''
</P>
<P>
   What these indelible movie images have in common, besides the
ability to conjure vivid memories, is their creator _ Stanley
Donen. The chorus boy turned choreographer turned master movie
director will be honored April 10, three days before he turns 75,
for his lifetime achievements at the Palm Beach International Film
Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Collecting career citations has been Donen's prime activity
lately, typified by his special award at last year's Oscars.
Upstaging King-of-the-World James Cameron, Donen expressed his
gratitude by nuzzling the gold statuette, crooning ``Cheek to
Cheek'' and breaking into a surprisingly spry tap step.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to show that I thought it was a lovely thing to
have,'' he says by phone from his high-rise apartment/office near
New York's Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the Academy had ever recognized his skills
and innovations as a filmmaker. ``I'd never won an Oscar, if that's
what you mean,'' he says sternly. Incredibly, Donen was not
nominated as director for any of his 27 feature films, including
some of the best musicals ever captured on celluloid.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he can still respect the Academy, he answers
puckishly, ``When people speak of an academy, I think of a group of
French men in robes, about six guys, sitting around a table. The
Academy is 6,000 people in the movie business. I don't mean to
demean them, but it's becoming a popularity contest.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he's not giving up his Oscar and says he's looking
forward to collecting the film festival's tribute, too. Will we get
a tap dance out of Donen? ``It doesn't just happen,'' he
admonishes. ``When I did it, it wasn't improvised. If I do it, I
have to know what's there and is there music and what's the place.
It's a whole big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The festival's artistic director, Mark Diamond, was taken aback
that Donen doesn't sing and tap each for acceptance speech. ``We
just assume he does that wherever he goes. Hopefully, he'll be
having such a wonderful time that he'll want to do a tap dance for
everybody. Because I'm sure that's what everybody will be
expecting.''
</P>
<P>
   Donen collects awards the same way he makes movies _
methodically and carefully, but with a twinkle and a verve that
make both processes seem spontaneous.
</P>
<P>
   Ask him, as everyone invariably does, about the giddy title song
sequence in ``Singin' in the Rain'' _ perhaps the most buoyant two
minutes in movie history _ and Donen will talk about the
painstaking effort involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is carefully thought out. You work on it for a
minimum of a year, if not two years,'' he says. ``By the time
you're shooting it, it's worked out down to the tiniest detail.''
</P>
<P>
   Donen and his star, Gene Kelly, who served as co-director and
co-choreographer, experimented on the sound stage of a New York
streetscape, planning out the dance steps as well as the
choreography of the camera. Far more than others filmmakers of the
day, Donen understood that camera movement could be an integral
part of a musical number's flow. And the result of that meticulous
trial-and-error is what became the Donen touch, an underappreciated
quality called ``effortlessness.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't ask him about the Donen touch. ``Other people tell me
there's such a thing. I don't know what it is,'' he says.
``Sometimes I get upset that they see similarities in what I do.
While I don't want to complain, I like to be thought of as gifted.
I just don't want to be thought of as limited.''
</P>
<P>
   The other adjective that makes him even more aggravated is
``inactive.'' Gathering awards and doing a little dance is
gratifying, but it can't compare with getting back into the
director's chair. It has been 15 years since Donen's last feature,
``Blame It On Rio,'' a subpar dirty old man sitcom starring Michael
Caine and Demi Moore.
</P>
<P>
   But he's stayed busy. ``I wasn't willing to say `yes' ... to
what was proposed. But I never stopped pushing the snowball up the
mountain. In that period you call `inactivity,' there was very much
activity on my part.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 12, the Donen drought ends when his film of A.R.
Gurney's WASP chronicle ``Love Letters,'' featuring Steven Weber
and Laura Linney, is broadcast on ABC. On stage, it was a
recitation of correspondence between the characters, from
kindergarten to old age. On screen, Donen has turned it into a
fluid journey, with a dash of his martini-dry sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the projects he has been shepherding since the
mid-'80s, ``Love Letters'' almost didn't happen. ``I was working on
it forever as a movie for theaters and then Universal was bought by
Seagrams and they canceled the picture. No other studio wanted to
make it either, so it lay dormant until it was possible to do it on
television.''
</P>
<P>
   After nearly 60 years in show business, since he made his
Broadway debut in the chorus of Pal Joey at the age of 16, he's
never worked in television.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really conceived for television, in order to do it in
the very modest amount of time allotted and to do it for a very
modest amount of money,'' he says. ``We made it horrendously
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   It has not helped Donen's career that the movies have turned
their backs on making musicals, that singularly American art form
at which he excelled, from 1949's ``On the Town'' to 1978's faux
double feature, ``Movie Movie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not being made because there's no group of people who
are making them, so there's no people to draw on to make them,'' he
notes. ``Another reason is they don't translate easily into foreign
languages. You can't dub Barbra Streisand's voice singing Spanish,
and those foreign markets have become very important. So everything
is conspiring against it, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood is a vastly different place than the one young Stanley
Donen found in 1943, three years after leaving his hometown of
Columbia, S.C. Having worked as assistant choreographer to Kelly on
Broadway's ``Best Foot Forward,'' he followed his star westward at
a time when the movie musical was flourishing. Donen's first film
job was hoofing in the chorus of that same show, followed by
choreographing numbers alongside Kelly in ``Cover Girl'' and ``Take
Me Out to the Ball Game.'' By 1949, Kelly and Donen were
co-directing ``On the Town.''
</P>
<P>
   Donen scoffs at the prevailing view that Kelly would deal with
the staging of scenes and he would be in charge of the camera.
``Nothing is ever strictly divided. Everybody is mucking in to do
everything, or at least that's the way we did it.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked to explain how the directorial collaboration worked,
Donen used to say, jokingly, ``If you substitute the word `fight'
for `co-direct,' then you have it. It wasn't always like that with
Gene, but it gradually came to be that, and eventually it came to
be impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Donen began directing on his own (and if you compare his work
with Kelly's solo direction, it's clear who was more talented.)
Donen produced such stellar work as ``Royal Wedding,'' ``Seven
Brides for Seven Brothers'' and ``Funny Face.'' After a two-picture
teaming with George Abbott on the movie versions of ``The Pajama
Game'' and ``Damn Yankees,'' Donen moved to London and began making
effervescent, European-flavored romantic comedies, such as
``Indiscreet,'' ``Charade'' and ``Two For the Road.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not return to the United States until 1975, when he made
a few lesser films, including the empty-headed ``Saturn 3'' and the
expensive failure ``Lucky Lady,'' with Gene Hackman, Liza Minnelli
and Burt Reynolds. Of local boy Reynolds, Donen says, ``He was
difficult. We didn't get along very well, but since then, we've
sort of made up and become friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Eternal romantic Donen has been married five times, including
actresses Marion Marshall and Yvette Mimieux, and divorced five
times _ most recently in 1994. Just as he remained optimistic about
marriage, so has he continued to pursue work.
</P>
<P>
   Donen says he looks forward to coming to Palm Beach and basking
in the warm sun and the adulation, but he's looking forward more to
reactions about his new film. For him, it is a calling card,
reminding the industry of his ability and availability.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I hope,'' Donen says softly. ``All we want is a
chance to do good work, that's what we're all looking for.''

 &HT;    Attending church on time may require a bit of pre-Easter clock
tweeking
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service ATLANTA _ For all those churchgoers who
<TEXT>
plan to rise before dawn for Easter sunrise services, you may want
to get to bed an hour earlier.
<P>
   Daylight-saving time coincides with Easter for the first time
since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   While some church leaders expressed confidence the faithful will
move their clocks an hour forward and make it to services on time,
others forewarned their flock.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Scott Hearn, whose 550-member Creekside United
Methodist Church is having a 7 a.m. sunrise service, reminded
members of the time change at Palm Sunday, Maundy Thursday and Good
Friday services. He published a reminder in the church bulletin and
put it on the church's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   As a bit of insurance, the minister said, he will e-mail
everyone over the weekend. ``Ninety-eight percent of our members
have e-mail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Atlanta's First Presbyterian Church, volunteers will have to
make sure they wake up in time to cook the grits and have the
coffee ready for about 400 homeless people who eat there at 6:30
each Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prayer breakfast will go on as usual,'' vowed the Rev.
Charles Black, associate pastor for community ministries.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Eddie Long and the staff of New Birth Missionary Baptist
Church in south DeKalb County have faith that their faithful will
make it to the city's largest service. New Birth, which claims
22,000 members, usually has Sunday worship services at 6:30 a.m., 9
a.m. and 12:30 p.m., but has reserved the Georgia Dome for a single
Easter service at 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kinda', sorta' forgot the time change,'' confessed Gregory
Mitchell, the church's director of media. But, he said, ``most of
our congregation is used to being up early for services. I don't
anticipate that much trouble.''

FBI AGENTS DIG ON TEXAS RANCHLAND; MAY BE SEEKING BONES OF MISSING
ATHEIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By BOB MAHLBURG 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FBI agents armed with a federal search warrant hauled digging
equipment onto a ranch in a remote area of South Texas on Friday,
apparently looking for the bodies of missing atheist leader Madalyn
Murray O'Hair and two relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Ranch owner Joanne Friend said she was startled when FBI agents
knocked on her door about noon on Friday and announced they had a
warrant to search for the three bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they were looking for bodies,'' Friend said. ``They
said they suspected they were there.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokesman Mike Appleby in San Antonio confirmed that a
search warrant was executed and that the owners of the ranch were
not implicated. But he told The Associated Press, ``We're not
acknowledging that there was any digging or whether it's related to
the O'Hair investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Department of Public Safety spokesman Tom Vinger in
Austin told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram: ``We are assisting the
FBI, searching for evidence related to Madalyn Murray O'Hair at an
undisclosed location.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair, her son, Jon Garth Murray, and daughter, Robin Murray
O'Hair, vanished from San Antonio in September 1995 along with
$500,000 in gold.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair gained prominence in the 1960s by successfully
challenging organized use of prayer in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Alma Short, clerk at Quality Supply Co. in Camp Wood near the
ranch about 100 miles west of San Antonio, said that yesterday's
search was the talk of the town of 746.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows about it,'' said Short, who added that she had
seen digging equipment brought past the store and helicopters
flying overhead.
</P>
<P>
   The hunt could have resulted from information gathered by
federal agents who spent more than 10 hours interviewing an
ex-convict jailed in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Gary P. Karr was arrested last week and charged with a federal
weapons violation. FBI agents testified at his detention hearing
that they interviewed Karr at his home, said Karr's lawyer, federal
public defender Richard Helfrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their characterization of those interviews was that Mr. Karr
was cooperative with regards to matters relating to Texas involving
homicides,'' Helfrick told the San Antonio Express-News in a
telephone interview from Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Helfrick, however, declined to say if Karr admitted a role in
any slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Karr, 50, and David R. Waters, 52, were arrested last week after
teams of local and federal agents searched their apartments. Agents
are reported to have found two loaded pistols in Karr's apartment
in a Detroit suburb and 119 rounds of ammunition in Waters'
apartment in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are ex-convicts and were charged with being felons in
possession of firearms or ammunition and were being held without
bond Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Waters was the O'Hairs' office manager at their American Atheist
headquarters in 1994. In 1995, he pleaded guilty to stealing
$54,000 from them.
</P>
<P>
   Waters has denied involvement in the O'Hairs' disappearance or
the death of Danny Fry, a friend of his whose nude, headless and
handless body was found near Dallas soon after the O'Hairs
vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Friend said she has no idea why officials think the O'Hairs'
bodies are there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just said they wanted us to know they were looking over
the property and we have nothing to do with it,'' Friend said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she knows of no connections between the ranch and
O'Hair or her followers.
</P>
<P>
   The family ranch is leased out most of the time, Friend said.
She is one of three daughters who each inherited a chunk of the
ranch from their father, John Wesley Cooksey. The mostly flat ranch
dotted with oak trees is on the east side of Texas 55 just south of
Camp Wood and about 35 miles from Uvalde.
</P>
<P>
   By noon, the ranch was swarming with FBI agents, U.S. Marshals
and DPS troopers, area residents said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was FBI at the gate and about 100 yards down the road
and it said FBI on the jackets,'' said David Falcon, manager of
Casa Falcon Restaurant in Camp Wood, who said he used to shear
goats on the ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all just flat land,'' Falcon said. ``There's little
mountains, but you got to go way back there.''
</P>
<P>
   Friend said authorities did not give her any indication how long
they thought the search would last.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't know, but they said they'd let us know when they're
through,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said the FBI has got a search warrant for the property
and they do not want us on it while they're searching.''
</P>

<P>
   MORINI, Albania _ Hounded from their homes and herded by police
cars and tanks into columns that snake through the valleys of
southern Kosovo, the flood of refugees leaving the Serbian province
surged by nearly 54,000 people Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 1.8 million ethnic Albanians who lived in Kosovo, more
than 310,000 of them have made the journey in the last 10 days to
neighboring countries like Macedonia and Albania. NATO officials
estimated Friday that some 600,000 refugees still inside Kosovo are
slowly making their way out, and many are destined for Albania,
which has already received more refugees than any other nation.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the new refugees are expected to arrive over the next
several days at the tiny border crossing in this small mountain
town. Friday night, when the authorities closed the crossing here
at 9 p.m., long lines of refugees who were waiting to enter Albania
were forced to bed down in open, hostile Serb territory. As they
waited, the line grew constantly as Serb forces continued pushing
groups of refugees toward the border.
</P>
<P>
   But refugees from Kosovo are stepping from one nightmare into
another. Many have not had food or water for three or four days.
They have waited hours, even days, to get here, seeking safety,
shelter and food.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is precious little here. Food supplies are running
out. Water has been off and on during the day and electricity is
flickering.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is out of control. It is catastrophic,'' the
Albanian information minister, Musa Ulqini, said Friday as the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees declared ``a major humanitarian
emergency in northern Albania. Even as officials from the UNHCR
held a two-hour emergency meeting Friday night, some 5,000 more
refugees crossed the border here.
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Macedonia, 121,000 ethnic Albanian refugees have
streamed into the country, nearly 30 percent of them in the last 24
hours, increasing already-strained relations between ethnic groups
there. And, since last week, some 60,000 have made their way into
Montenegro, still a part of Yugoslavia but increasingly estranged
from its leader, Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are witnessing up there is something we have not seen
in Europe since World War II,'' said Andrea Angeli, a spokesman for
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is
helping coordinate the relief effort.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The small, ramshackle Albanian border town of Kukes, population
20,000, is being quickly overwhelmed by the flood of refugees
despite frantic efforts by Albanian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In an even tinier place, Kouma , with a normal population of
3,500, has swollen to 20,000 by taking in refugees from the Hass
Region, which straddles the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is only the tip of the iceberg,'' warned Eugene
O'Sullivan, head of the OSCE observer team as he struggled to find
more sanitation facilities, medical care and food for the even
larger number of refugees that is expected. ``We are reaching a
crisis and it is going to get worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Desperately needed here are more transport to ferry the
refugees, many of whom are on foot; food; a field kitchen, and
medical facilities to supplant the poorly equipped local hospital
where eight people have already died after the journey.
</P>
<P>
   The refugee problem is made even more difficult, O'Sullivan and
other aid workers said, because of the isolation of Kukes and the
surrounding area, which is reachable only by a single, crumbling
road that twists and turns dizzily over the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   It is about a six-hour trip from the capital, Tirana, in the
best of times, but now the narrow road itself is clogged with
refugees moving south, most of them in slow-moving farm tractors
pulling carts full of women and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Kukes District, the situation has become absolutely
critical,'' Ulqini, the information minister, said. ``During the
night and up to this morning the influx of Albanians in need of
help coming from Kosovo has been extraordinary. The situation is
rapidly getting worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every household in town has taken in refugees,
sometimes by the dozens, with people sleeping on floors. Others are
packed along the cold concrete floor of a school, gathered in front
of a mosque or in a truck repair lot. Many of those arriving in the
past few nights have been sleeping in open fields, raising fears
among relief workers of cholera unless latrines are dug.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an emergency within an emergency,'' said Angeli the
OSCE spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the difficulty getting supplies here, the first
concern of the relief effort has been to move the refugees out of
the mountains and into tent camps or existing refugee shelters near
Tirana or the Adriatic Sea port of Durres.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian government mobilized buses in the first few days
and successfully brought many of the first wave of refugees out of
the mountains, but the effort has lagged in the past few days even
as the refugee flow has mounted.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, the Albanian government ordered all of its idle
trucks into the mountains to transport people. But even mercenary
cabdrivers from Tirana who hoped to make money carrying refugees
were dismayed by the broken and pot-holed road. ``If I had known
the roads were like this, I never would have come,'' one cabdriver
told a friend. ``Any money I make will go to fix the car.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been little advance planning among relief agencies for
the refugee crisis, apparently because, relief workers said
privately, when this year's budgets were being planned, the
agencies were lulled into the belief that talks between Milosevic
and the West would be successful. Such talks have rarely led to
progress in the past.

STORM KILLS 7 AS THEY TREK FROM MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>

   LOS ANGELES _ A freak spring snowstorm trapped several dozen
illegal immigrants in wilderness mountain terrain east of San Diego
overnight, leaving at least seven people dead. Some were still
reported missing, and more than 50 were rescued in a sprawling
search effort over slushy hillsides north of the Mexican border,
immigration officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   South of the border, in the area of La Rumorosa near Tecate,
Mexican authorities rescued more than 80 other people and recovered
at least two bodies, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   American authorities first learned of the immigrants' plight
when a woman, suffering in 30-degree temperatures, sought help from
a rancher near Alpine, about 40 miles east of San Diego, late
Thursday night. The woman said her husband and a female friend were
lost in the storm that dumped nearly a foot and a half of snow in
higher reaches of the Cleveland National Forest along Interstate 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was literally freezing and just looking for help,'' said
Bill Strassberger, a spokesman for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. Both the woman's husband and her friend
were later found dead, along with five others by midday Friday.
Rescue workers using helicopters, dogs and foot searches through
steep ravines found the survivors, many of whom were treated for
hypothermia and exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Eight people remained hospitalized early Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very mountainous, treacherous area that they come
through, with a lot of peaks and valleys,'' Strassberger said,
adding that more than one group of immigrants was involved and that
all appeared to have been abandoned by their smugglers in the bad
weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these people are dressed very lightly,'' he added,
wearing ``possibly a light jacket and sometimes just short-sleeved
shirts and jeans.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said would-be immigrants had increasingly sought entry
routes in more remote and dangerous areas of eastern San Diego
County and neighboring Imperial County, as stepped-up enforcement
efforts have dramatically slowed the flow across the border at more
traditional crossings near San Diego. Last year, more than 140
illegal immigrants died trying to cross into the two counties.
</P>
<P>
   One Border Patrol agent who was on his way to join in the rescue
effort, which officials called the largest such undertaking in that
region in memory, crashed his car on a slippery road.
</P>
<P>
   Even Friday afternoon, wet snow and occasional fog hampered
search efforts conducted from a mobile interagency command post on
Japatul Road near the Viejas Indian Reservation east of Alpine.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's deputies and firefighters in Alpine said most of the
victims had been found at elevations of about 3,500 feet above sea
level.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard helicopters, Border Patrol and Forest Service
agents, and California Highway Patrol officers joined forces to
comb the area some 15 miles north of the Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain areas of it is rough terrain,'' said Lt. Linda Fulton
of the San Diego County sheriff's substation at Alpine, whose
deputies assisted in search and rescue efforts. ``It is mountainous
and it is definitely covered with snow. Our helicopter units did
airlift some victims and some bodies, just doing a grid search in
certain areas where the victims had related their last location.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service reported that up to 16 inches of
snow fell in area mountains over the last two days, with
temperatures falling to the low 30s overnight.
</P>
<P>
   An El Nino storm last April left three migrants dead, and a
similar surprise snowstorm in February 1997 killed seven people.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Ridgeway, a spokeswoman for Grossmont Hospital in La
Mesa, said four people had been treated for exposure, one suffering
from advanced hypothermia.
</P>
<P>
   Two were released in the custody of the INS, Ms. Ridgeway said,
and two remained hospitalized in stable condition, treated with
warm fluids and bed rest.
</P>
<P>
   Strassberger of the INS said the survivors who were not
hospitalized ``should be returned to Mexico fairly quickly, some
quite possibly today, most by tomorrow.''

MARINE SENTENCED TO DISMISSAL FOR DESTROYING VIDEOTAPE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif, N.C., N.Y.)   (rk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A military jury Friday sentenced the navigator of a
jet that severed ski lift cables in the Italian Alps last year,
killing 20 people, to dismissal from the Marine Corps for
obstructing justice by destroying a personal videotape he shot
during the flight.
</P>
<P>
   The jury at Camp Lejeune, N.C., imposed no prison sentence for
the officer, Capt. Joseph P. Schweitzer.
</P>
<P>
   The dismissal is the equivalent of a dishonorable discharge for
an enlisted service member. The charges against Schweitzer,
obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice, carried
maximum sentences of five years.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence, which could be appealed and eventually set aside,
makes it unlikely that anyone will go to jail in the accident,
which caused the ski lift's gondola to fall about 400 feet. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The pilot of the plane, which was on a low-level training
mission, faces court-martial on the same charges. But he is not
accused of destroying the tape, only removing it from his video
camera, taking it off the plane after an emergency landing in
Aviano and giving it to Schweitzer.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Marine Corps, Lt. Col. Ellen K. Haddock,
said it would be wrong to view the sentence pronounced Friday as
lenient.
</P>
<P>
   ``While that word `dismissal' doesn't sound like much, that is a
punitive discharge,'' she said. ``It's more than losing your job.
This is a felony offense, and it's a record.''
</P>
<P>
   Haddock added, ``This will stay with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Military officers and veterans said the dismissal would probably
bar Schweitzer from getting a job based on his 10 years of
experience with the Marines and as a graduate of the Naval Academy.
Schweitzer was an electronic counter-measures officer, and his role
on the four-seat EA-6B Prowler jet that crashed was mission
planning, navigation and communications with the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Under the sentencing, he will not be eligible for ordinary
veterans' benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y., pleaded guilty on Monday, the
day before his court-martial was supposed to begin. A jury was
empaneled anyway, because under the military justice system, the
defendant can choose whether to be sentenced by a judge or a jury.
</P>
<P>
   A secret part of the plea bargain assured that Schweitzer would
not be sent to jail. But the jury of nine officers did not know
that until after it completed its deliberations, which took a
little more than three hours Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The dismissal could be reduced or set aside by the officer who
ordered the court-martial, Lt. Gen. Peter Pace, commander of Marine
Corps Forces Atlantic. Schweitzer could also appeal to the
Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals, which sometimes
reduces sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer had faced manslaughter and homicide charges after the
flight, but those were dropped after a different jury acquitted the
pilot, Capt. Richard J. Ashby, 32, of Mission Viejo, Calif., of
those charges. Ashby's court martial on the obstruction charges is
scheduled to begin in three weeks, and his lawyers have not
indicated that he will plead guilty.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Schweitzer, tearful and remorseful, had testified on Thursday
night that he had never viewed the videotape, not having a camera
capable of playing it back. But he said he feared that the Italian
news media would use a shot of him smiling into the camera, which
he believed he recorded, with footage of the twisted gondola lying
on bloody snow. He also said he feared that Italian authorities
would misconstrue textbook low-altitude maneuvers as reckless
flying.
</P>
<P>
   He testified that he eventually tossed the tape on a bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer had bought the tape at a PX on the base and borrowed
Ashby's camera to make a recording on what was supposed to be one
of their last flights before rotating home from Bosnia duty to
Cherry Point, N.C. Ashby had testified that he never saw the
videotape again after giving it to Schweitzer.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by his lawyers and his parents and looking weary this
afternoon, Schweitzer told reporters, ``I was here to accept
responsibility for my actions and I respect the decision that was
made by my peers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My immediate plans,'' he said, ``are basically to wake up
tomorrow morning and not have to deal with this for the first time
in 14 months.''

DIG IN TEXAS FAILS TO FIND ATHEIST FIGURE OR HER FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Mich.)  (js) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal agents searched two remote sites in Texas
Friday, stepping up the search for the body of Madalyn Murray
O'Hair, the atheist leader who disappeared in 1995 with her son,
her granddaughter and $500,000 in gold coins, government officials
here said.
</P>
<P>
   After digging throughout the day, searchers had failed to find
any trace of Mrs. O'Hair, whose Supreme Court case in 1963 led to a
ban on organized prayer in the public schools. But the officials
said agents of the FBI and local authorities in Texas were hopeful
that they were finally close to a solution for the perplexing
four-year-old case.
</P>
<P>
   The officials would state no grounds for that hope, or explain
what had happened that led to the digging Friday. But the growing
activity in the case appears to have sprung from the arrest last
week of two men, one of them a former employee of Mrs. O'Hair's
organization, American Atheists Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The officials here said only that the digging had occurred at
two sites somewhere outside San Antonio. But The Associated Press
reported from San Antonio that the search was being undertaken on a
ranch about 100 miles west of the city, near the town of Camp Wood.
</P>
<P>
   The two men arrested last week are David R. Waters, the former
employee of American Atheists, who was seized when agents found a
large quantity of ammunition in a search of his apartment in
Austin, Texas, and Gary P. Karr, arrested when two loaded handguns
were found in his apartment in Novi, Mich. Waters and Karr served
sentences at the same minimum-security penitentiary in Vienna,
Ill., for an eight-month period in the 1980s and have been charged
under a federal law barring felons from possessing ammunition or
firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Waters, who once managed an office for Mrs. O'Hair in Austin,
pleaded guilty in 1994 to charges of stealing $54,000 from her
organization. The $500,000 that disappeared along with Mrs. O'Hair
was withdrawn from an account belonging to the atheist group.
</P>
<P>
   Karr spent more than two decades in prison after a series of
crimes in 1974. He left prison in May 1995, four months before Mrs.
O'Hair, her son Jon Garth Murray and her granddaughter, Robin
Murray-O'Hair, disappeared in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Waters and Karr have not been charged in connection with the
O'Hair case. But last week Waters' court-appointed lawyer said a
federal prosecutor had advised him that Waters was suspected of
being part of a plot to rob and murder Mrs. O'Hair.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There has been fog and rain over Yugoslavia for
most of NATO's 10-day air campaign, but politicians and their
assessment of public sensitivities have grounded just as many
bombing runs as has the weather.
</P>
<P>
   The allies' initial stated goal of stopping Serb forces that are
attacking ethnic Albanians, could have been approached in three
ways, whether the targets are tanks or supply depots:
</P>
<P>
   _ NATO can launch satellite-steered missiles from ships or
planes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fighter bombers, including F-15Es and F-117s, can attack from
high altitudes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Or tank-killing A-10s can barrel in low and shoot up armor
columns with fearsome cannons and rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Foul weather, while not hampering cruise missile strikes, has
put a serious crimp in the high-flying jets, which need to see
their targets clearly to guide the bombs precisely.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to warplanes going in low, slow and hard,
American political leaders from President Clinton on down have
reined in commanders, fearing downed planes and casualties.
</P>
<P>
   On several occasions, military officials said, field commanders
thought the military risk of low-flying attacks was acceptable,
only to be overruled by their civilian bosses who were driven by
what they perceive to be the political risks of losing an aircraft
and its pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO military commander, has tried to
work around the elements _ and the politics _ by asking Washington
and other NATO nations for Apache helicopter gunships and batteries
of field artillery and long-range rockets. But for other political
reasons, the request is snarled here and in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect military commanders are somewhat frustrated over the
limitations that are being put on them,'' said Gen. Charles Horner,
a retired Air Force officer who directed the 1991 Persian Gulf air
war. ``Quite frankly, it's gradualism versus overwhelming force.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the air campaign began, NATO's political leaders had
taken steps to crimp its scope. They established strict rules on
what risks pilots could take and how narrowly the targets had to be
defined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any military action involves balancing the need to strike
targets quickly with the need to do it in a way that is safe as
possible to the pilots,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said
Friday. ``We want to keep the risk as acceptable as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The intersection of those restrictions with the weather has
forced commanders to cancel about 20 percent of their ground-attack
missions, the Pentagon said Friday, although other officials that
ratio is closer to half of all the combat flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous,'' said one Air Force officer involved in the
Balkans policy. ``This whole mindset of losing pilots is hurting
our ability to roll them back and use the full capability of air
power.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the technological advances of American stealthy
fighters, laser-guided bombs and satellite-steered missiles, all of
them intended to inflict maximum damage on an adversary with
minimal risk to pilots, the elements can upset that balance
relatively easily.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it should surprise military commanders. Virtually every
prolonged aerial campaign in Europe in World War II was hampered by
fog and rain, said Michael S. Sherry, a military historian at
Northwestern University. High-altitude B-29 bombing runs over Japan
were buffeted by the jet stream, forcing the warplanes to adopt
low-altitude, night raids, Sherry said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Balkans, clouds have blocked pilots from beaming their
lasers to targets on the ground to guide bombs to their targets.
Pilots can drop unguided bombs, as B-1 bombers did on Thursday,
hitting a staging area for troops, but that poses greater risks to
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   On only one day in the past 10 have pilots had optimal
conditions for bombing _ a cloud ceiling of at least 25,000 feet
and visibility of more than five miles. ``The weather has been
lousy, and that has had a big impact on the number of strikes we've
been able to carry out,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the Pentagon wheeled out red, yellow and
green stop-light charts to show weather's effect on the operation.
Only one day in the first six was green, for optimal weather. The
rest of the chart was checkered with yellow lights (cloud ceiling
between 10,000 and 25,000 feet) and red lights (ceiling below
10,000 feet).
</P>
<P>
   In theory, fighter-bombers could dip in under the clouds, but
the best altitude for these warplanes is about 25,000 feet _ close
enough to identify and lock on targets, but out of range of most of
Yugoslavia's formidable surface-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Commanders prefer laser-guided bombs because of their accuracy _
and the reduced risk of causing unintended casualties on the
ground. Italy and Greece have been particularly worried about
attacks on targets in populated areas, causing strains in the
19-member alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Another handicap for the higher flying planes is that there are
no commandos on the ground, as there were in the Gulf War, acting
as spotters.
</P>
<P>
   The few times the clouds have cleared this week, military
planners scrambled to take advantage of the opportunity. On
Thursday, fighter-bombers attacked a motorized brigade that was
waiting to fill up with fuel. Bridges were struck to limit the
ability of the Yugoslav army and the special police to resupply
their forces.
</P>
<P>
   But the allies' main weapon of choice against ground troops has
done little but fly reconnaissance.
</P>
<P>
   These planes, the U.S. A-10 Warthogs, which can fire Maverick
missiles and 30-millimeter cannons from over a mile from their
target, have not been ordered to fly under low clouds to avoid
Serbia's menacing surface-to-air fire.
</P>
<P>
   Commanders say their pilots are willing to take greater risks,
but politicians fear that an American public conditioned to
low-casualty conflicts will not accept a steep death toll from the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president and Congress are gun-shy about this very
sensitive issue,'' said Brent Scowcroft, a retired Air Force
general who was President Bush's national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The climate _ political and meteorological _ has forced NATO to
rely more heavily on missiles launched from ships and planes, as
well as bombs dropped from B-2 bombers, all of which satellites
guide to pre-programmed targets.
</P>
<P>
   But cruise missiles are effective only against fixed targets and
are expensive, costing between $600,000 and $1 million apiece.
Moreover, the Air Force is running low on air-launched missiles,
and industry officials say it will take weeks to convert
nuclear-tipped cruise missiles in stock to ones armed with
conventional explosives.
</P>
<P>
   To work around these weather obstacles, NATO is using unmanned
drones to reconnoiter the battlefield. An airborne
ground-surveillance plane, called JStars, can monitor large troop
movements. But Serb tanks and armor have dispersed in the hilly,
wooded terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Clark wants Apache helicopters because the region's mountainous
terrain is ideal for hunting tanks. Apaches can hover just behind
the crest of a hill, exposing only their radar to identify a
target. They rise quickly to fire off missiles from three miles
from the target, and pop back down to safety.
</P>
<P>
   The rocketry requested, the Multiple Launch Rocket System with a
range of about 18 miles and the ATACMS, a rocket system, with a
range of about 180 miles, attack air defenses.
</P>
<P>
   But Clark's request has been hung up on several political snags,
alliance officials said. These systems suggest a ground war more
than an air war, and would require approval from NATO, as well as
either Albania or Macedonia, where the weaponry would be based.

<P>
   WASHINGTON -- U.S. cruise missiles struck a pair of government
buildings in downtown Belgrade Friday night, setting them ablaze
and taking NATO's ten-day-old bombing campaign to the heart of
Yugoslavia's capital for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade's state-run TV showed Serb police headquarters and the
nearby interior ministry in flames shortly after explosions rocked
the capital around 1 a.m. (6 p.m. EST).
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said U.S. naval ships launched
seven cruise missiles at the buildings, nerve centers for the
campaign of terror Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic is waging against
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are striking at targets in downtown Belgrade that are at
the core of his ability to command and control the troops that have
been used for ethnic cleansing in Kosovo,'' said Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   State-run media in Belgrade reported NATOforces also struck an
army barracks in southeast Serbia and a major highway junction west
of the Kosovo provincial capital of Pristina. NATO has stepped up
its efforts
</P>
<P>
   in recent days to cut off key supply routes used to deliver fuel
and ammunition to Serb forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, Serb prosecutors began building their case
against three American soldiers captured Wednesday near Kosovo's
border with Macedonia. Reports on the proceedings were sketchy, and
there was no word as to whether the soldiers appeared before
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials insisted the capture had not affected the
alliance's ongoing air campaign. More than 2,000 sorties in ten
days have failed to halt Yugoslavia's brutal campaign to rid Kosovo
of ethnic Albanians. That mission appeared well on its way toward
completion by Friday, with an estimated one out of every three
Kosovars having been forced from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina, an estimated 200,000 Kosovar Albanians were jammed
around a railroad station awaiting forced deportation at the hands
of Yugoslav troops and local police.
</P>
<P>
   At least five trainloads of people _ all forced from their homes
under threat of execution _ were deported Friday from Pristina to
neighboring Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of others streamed by foot, car or tractor
across Kosovo's border into Albania, many braving a heavily-mined
field to make their way out of Serbia, Yugoslavia's main state.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 225,000 Kosovar Albanians have taken refuge in
Albania and Macedonia since NATO air strikes began March 24. They
fled Serb troops, local police and paramilitary thugs who have
shelled civilians, torched villages and executed people at will.
</P>
<P>
   Another 31,000 refugees have fled to Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned by the enormity of the humanitarian catastrophe, the
United States and its NATO allies announced a massive air lift,
starting this weekend, to get food, medicine and tents to refugee
sites the size of cities that have sprung up overnight along
Kosovo's mountainous border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are no longer facing an internal Yugoslav crisis,'' NATO
spokesman Jamie Shea said at alliance headquarters in Brussels.
``We are facing a crisis of the entire region, with far-reaching
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton reiterated his concern for the
treatment of the captured Americans, stressing that Milosevic would
be held accountable for their welfare.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials were still trying to learn where the men were
being held, and the State Department said Red Cross representatives
had been denied access to the men.
</P>
<P>
   The United States rejects Serb plans to put the men on trial for
unspecified charges of ``aggression,'' contenting such action is a
violation of the Geneva Conventions on the treatment of prisoners
of war.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reiterated that there were no plans to send ground
troops into Kosovo, saying he intends to press forward with air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe that we have a good possibility of achieving
our mission with the means that we have deployed,'' Clinton said.
``We must be determined, we must be persistent, we must be patient
if we expect to see this mission through. And I am absolutely
determined to do that.''

   As he has in the past, Clinton stressed that the flood of
refugees from Kosovo were caused by an orchestrated campaign
conducted by troops under the authority of Milosevic, president of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that what Mr. Milosevic wants to do is to
keep the land of Kosovo and rid it of its people,'' Clinton said at
a brief White House news conference. ``We have to make sure that
Mr. Milosevic pays a heavy price for this policy of repression.''

<P>
   Hours later, cruise missiles fired from two U.S. naval vessels
struck the Yugoslav Interior Ministry and the Serbian police
headquarters in downtown Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   In other action, the supersonic B-1 bomber was used for the
first time in the conflict, striking Serb tanks and troops at
several staging areas in central Kosovo, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   Among the forces targeted were units of the 243rd mechanized
brigade, a mobile infantry group that has spent much of the week
shelling civilians pinned down in a valley in southwest Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim ends)
</P>
<P>
   Other NATO attacks reported Friday were on Serb fuel and
ammunition depots and two military airfields.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said bombing runs continue to be impeded by poor
weather. But they insisted the air campaign was gaining traction
and that the cumulative impact of ten days of attacks was beginning
to hamper the Serbs' ability to continue their rampage across
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   There have been signs, for example, that NATO attacks on fuel
and ammunition dumps and on bridges and roads have disrupted
efforts to resupply Serb forces in the field.
</P>
<P>
   At least one Serb battle group was sidelined early Thursday when
its vehicles ran out of fuel outside of Dakovica, a city near the
Albanian border.
</P>
<P>
   Amidst NATO promises to continue escalating the campaign,
Pentagon planners were reviewing a NATO request to add 75
carrier-based warplanes to the effort.
</P>
<P>
   While no formal approval had been granted, the USS Roosevelt, a
nuclear-powered aircraft carrier with roughly 50 attack jets and
two dozen reconnaissance and support aircraft, was steaming toward
the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   The Roosevelt, expected to arrive in the region as early as
Monday, is scheduled to relieve the USS Enterprise, on duty in the
Persian Gulf. NATO commander Gen. Wesley Clark has asked that the
carrier instead be assigned to the NATO mission against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't surprise me if the Theodore Roosevelt is vectored
into the Mediterranean in support of Allied Force for a while, but
there's been no final decision,'' Bacon told reporters, using the
name given to the NATO air campaign. ``It would give us additional
planes to help do the job that we're doing, which is to continue
with our systematic day and night attacks designed to choke off the
Serb military.''
</P>
<P>
   There are about 220 American warplanes in the region now, part
of a NATO armada of more than 400 planes.

<P>
   WASHINGTON -- U.S. cruise missiles struck a pair of government
buildings in downtown Belgrade Friday night, setting them ablaze
and taking NATO's ten-day-old bombing campaign to the heart of
Yugoslavia's capital for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade's state-run TV showed Serb police headquarters and the
nearby interior ministry in flames shortly after explosions rocked
the capital around 1 a.m. (6 p.m. EST).
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said U.S. naval ships launched
seven cruise missiles at the buildings, nerve centers for the
campaign of terror Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic is waging against
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are striking at targets in downtown Belgrade that are at
the core of his ability to command and control the troops that have
been used for ethnic cleansing in Kosovo,'' said Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   State-run media in Belgrade reported NATOforces also struck an
army barracks in southeast Serbia and a major highway junction west
of the Kosovo provincial capital of Pristina. NATO has stepped up
its efforts
</P>
<P>
   in recent days to cut off key supply routes used to deliver fuel
and ammunition to Serb forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, Serb prosecutors began building their case
against three American soldiers captured Wednesday near Kosovo's
border with Macedonia. Reports on the proceedings were sketchy, and
there was no word as to whether the soldiers appeared before
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials insisted the capture had not affected the
alliance's ongoing air campaign. More than 2,000 sorties in ten
days have failed to halt Yugoslavia's brutal campaign to rid Kosovo
of ethnic Albanians. That mission appeared well on its way toward
completion by Friday, with an estimated one out of every three
Kosovars having been forced from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina, an estimated 200,000 Kosovar Albanians were jammed
around a railroad station awaiting forced deportation at the hands
of Yugoslav troops and local police.
</P>
<P>
   At least five trainloads of people _ all forced from their homes
under threat of execution _ were deported Friday from Pristina to
neighboring Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of others streamed by foot, car or tractor
across Kosovo's border into Albania, many braving a heavily-mined
field to make their way out of Serbia, Yugoslavia's main state.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 225,000 Kosovar Albanians have taken refuge in
Albania and Macedonia since NATO air strikes began March 24. They
fled Serb troops, local police and paramilitary thugs who have
shelled civilians, torched villages and executed people at will.
</P>
<P>
   Another 31,000 refugees have fled to Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned by the enormity of the humanitarian catastrophe, the
United States and its NATO allies announced a massive air lift,
starting this weekend, to get food, medicine and tents to refugee
sites the size of cities that have sprung up overnight along
Kosovo's mountainous border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are no longer facing an internal Yugoslav crisis,'' NATO
spokesman Jamie Shea said at alliance headquarters in Brussels.
``We are facing a crisis of the entire region, with far-reaching
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton reiterated his concern for the
treatment of the captured Americans, stressing that Milosevic would
be held accountable for their welfare.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials were still trying to learn where the men were
being held, and the State Department said Red Cross representatives
had been denied access to the men.
</P>
<P>
   The United States rejects Serb plans to put the men on trial for
unspecified charges of ``aggression,'' contenting such action is a
violation of the Geneva Conventions on the treatment of prisoners
of war.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reiterated that there were no plans to send ground
troops into Kosovo, saying he intends to press forward with air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe that we have a good possibility of achieving
our mission with the means that we have deployed,'' Clinton said.
``We must be determined, we must be persistent, we must be patient
if we expect to see this mission through. And I am absolutely
determined to do that.''
</P>
<P>

   COMBAT
</P>
<P>
   NATO airstrikes hit the center of Yugoslavia's capital,
Belgrade, early Saturday, for the first time since the bombing
began on March 24. The Defense and Interior Ministries and the
Serbian republic's police headquarters were severely damaged. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The strikes came hours after a NATO spokesman said 10 days of
missile and bombing raids had not prevented a terror campaign
against Kosovo's ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   A Navy aircraft carrier was heading for the Mediterranean Sea
and was likely to join the fight against Yugoslavia, Pentagon
officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian reconnaissance frigate sailed from the Black Sea to
the Mediterranean to monitor NATO forces involved in raids against
Yugoslavia. Moscow said it would stay out of the conflict and not
share the intelligence data with Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said that he still believed NATO could achieve
its goals in Kosovo without ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force B-1 bomber flew its first mission against
Yugoslavia on Thursday night, making the Yugoslav conflict the
first in which the Air Force has used all three types of
intercontinental-range bombers: the B-1, the B-52 and the B-2
stealth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   REFUGEES
</P>
<P>
   The continuing exodus of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo was
overwhelming the province's neighbors. The U.N. High Commission for
Refugees estimated that 298,400 refugees had entered Albania,
Macedonia and Montenegro since March 24. Another 12,485 had gone to
Croatia, Bosnia and Turkey, bringing the total to 310,885, or
one-sixth of Kosovo's preconflict population of 1.8 million.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PRISONERS
</P>
<P>
   Serbian officials began gathering evidence for possible criminal
proceedings against three American soldiers who were captured along
the Macedonian-Yugoslav border on Wednesday and are being held in
Kosovo, the state-run Tanjug news agency reported. Sweden's
Ambassador to Yugoslavia forwarded a U.S. demand that the soldiers
be visited by the Red Cross and that they be released. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   YUGOSLAV POLITICS
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav police shut down B-92, Belgrade's most popular
independent radio station. Although the station's transmitter was
shut down late last month, B-92 still broadcast over satellite and
Internet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The government of Montenegro, which opposes President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia, called for calm as rumors spread that army
units in the republic were preparing a coup. On Thursday Milosevic
replaced several generals in Montenegro with men loyal to himself.
</P>
<P>
   A leading Kosovo Albanian politician, Hashim Thaqi, announced
the formation of a ``government'' for the province headed by
himself and excluding followers of Ibrahim Rugova, Albanian
television said. The report came a day after Rugova was shown on
Yugoslav television in talks with Milosevic. Rugova was president
of the unofficial parallel government that Kosovo Albanians
established after the province was stripped of its autonomy in
1989.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OTHER DEVELOPMENTS
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II, speaking during Good Friday rites in Rome,
compared the victims of the Kosovo conflict to the crucified
Christ. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The main cinema in the Siberian city in Irkutsk said it was
pulling American movies and showing instead Yugoslav features to
protest the NATO airstrikes. &QL;

   The New York Times News Service has sent the following Money and

</P>
<P>
   (This final budget subs MARKET-WATCH summary and byline, expands
summary for EXECUTIVE-PAY, eliminates MUTFUND-INSURANCE,
MUTFUND-INTERNET and BIZ-EMERGE-MARKETS and adds photo notes to
several stories.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ON THE SECTION FRONT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   EXECUTIVE-PAY (Undated) _ Silicon Valley's obsession with
executive stock options _ an obsession increasingly shared by the
rest of Corporate America _ is approaching an unhealthy extreme,
according to some pay consultants, recruiters and even investors.
Too many executives, these critics say, are focused on stock
performance and stock performance alone. By Reed Abelson. WITH

   FLA-FISHER-ISLAND (Fisher Island, Fla.) _ It's the have's vs.

Wall Street. By Gretchen Morgenson. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MUTFUND Quarterly &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-VALUE (Undated) _ Value managers have long shunned what
they view as overvalued growth stocks. Instead, they favor stocks
with lower price-to-earnings or other valuation ratios. But that
has lately brought grief for their shareholders, as stocks
relatively cheap by traditional measures continue to be clobbered
by the big growth companies. By Richard A. Oppel Jr. WITH GRAPHICS
and PHOTO.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-PERFORMANCE (Undated) _ Although it's fun to see who's
hot and who's not among mutual fund managers each quarter, the real
value in the performance figures lies in the stock market
intelligence they can provide. Looking behind the numbers can help
reveal the overall market's strength or weakness. And a closer look
can help gauge the current mood and vulnerabilities of investors.
By Gretchen Morgenson. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-BOGUS-REPORT (Undated) _ The number of fund offerings
has exploded in recent years, and the excuses that fund companies
give for starting them grow flimsier each day. More and more
portfolios are tied to idiosyncratic stock indexes, obscure
industry subsectors and ever more esoteric investing styles. The
logical end? Following are excerpts from an imaginary annual
report. By Daniel Akst.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-PICKS (Undated) _ When it comes to picking among the
thousands of mutual funds out there, investors want a rating system
that separates the wheat from the chaff. Unfortunately, the most
popular rating services get only half of the equation. They do a
good job of pinpointing the chaff of the investing arena, but are
not much help in identifying the wheat. By Mark Hulbert. WITH
GRAPHIC and PHOTO.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-CLOSED-END (Undated) _ Investors looking to ride the
resurgent, although risky, emerging markets may want to consider
closed-end funds. Emerging-markets closed-end funds are up 6.4
percent, on average, so far this year. By Virginia Munger Kahn.
WITH GRAPHIC and PHOTO.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-RETIRE (Undated) _ Despite some sharp ups and downs, the
bull market in large-capitalization stocks plowed forward through
the first quarter, confounding some money managers and rewarding
others. The story was no different for the five managers who have
built hypothetical retirement portfolios for The New York Times:
None of their portfolios lost money in the quarter, but only three
beat the average for diversified domestic equity funds, as tracked
by Lipper Inc. By Carole Gould.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-4MANAGERS (Undated) _ The managers of four of the
highest-ranked funds talked about what drove their performance and
looked ahead to the rest of the year. By Carole Gould. WITH PHOTO.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-INTERNATIONAL (Undated) _ Among portfolio managers who
specialize in buying shares of foreign companies, the most
successful in the first quarter were those who had researched and
cherry-picked their way through lesser-known equities, especially
the stocks hurt by the persistence of the Asian economic crisis and
Japan's deep recession. While international funds as a group rose
less than 1 percent in the quarter, many small-cap international
funds had double-digit gains. By Rick Gladstone. WITH PHOTO.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-TAX (Undated) _ Tax-managed mutual funds _ those that
seek to maximize after-tax gains rather than gross returns _ are
among the latest trends in the fund industry. More than half the 50
such funds were introduced after 1996, and combined assets in them
have grown from $3.19 billion to $15.36 billion over that period.
By Abby Schultz. WITH GRAPHIC.

 &HT;    Exploring a baby's learning curve
 &HT;    By Julie Bonnin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Baby and I face a television screen in a small
featureless room. We are sitting, she propped in my lap and me in a
straight-backed wooden chair.
</P>
<P>
   Nap?
</P>
<P>
   Check.
</P>
<P>
   Belly full?
</P>
<P>
   Check.
</P>
<P>
   Sweetie Girl _ I mean, my daughter, Katie _ is ready to go to
work.
</P>
<P>
   Like the thousands of others who've participated in studies at
the Children's Research Laboratory at the University of Texas, this
little trooper's sacrificing a ride in the stroller, a game of
peek-a-boo _ all in the name of science.
</P>
<P>
   Think astounding baby feats: when and what infants first see,
how their first words float to the surface of a bubbling, babbling
alphabet soup.
</P>
<P>
   These are the kinds of things being painstakingly measured at
CRL, perhaps the foremost lab of its kind for taking the stuff of
baby book entries and turning it into scientific data. That data
are important for a couple of reasons, says CRL director and
psychologist Leslie Cohen, who helped pioneer the techniques most
researchers now use to study babies.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing what infants are capable of at any given age helps
parents be better parents, giving them ideas about what game, song
or toy their child might enjoy and benefit from. And such research
helps parents and pediatricians identify problems early on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's essential that you know what your baby's supposed to do
at different ages,'' Cohen says, ``so you can really enjoy your
baby's development or begin to recognize if there's some kind of
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   A study of teen-age moms found babies whose mothers were taught
about infant development were healthier and more advanced. ``Their
mothers seemed to enjoy them more,'' Cohen says.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, public policy-makers are also interested in how
and when babies learn. Studies showing that early experiences have
a profound impact on the brain form the foundation for a statewide
initiative promoted by Texas first lady Laura Bush and by Texas
legislators lobbying for more money for programs for children from
newborn to age 3.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion of findings about early childhood development in
the past decade has come about partly in response to medical
advances that brought more babies into the world with special
needs, Cohen says. But the research also dovetailed with the
emergence of the superbaby/superparent phenomenon in the 1980s.
Anyone who thinks flash-card parenting is a thing of the past ought
to talk to the people at CRL, who find themselves turning down
countless parents who want to submit their babies to infant IQ
tests. (CRL refers them elsewhere).
</P>
<P>
   Today's moms and dads can immerse themselves in parenting
information if they choose to, and many of them do. While knowing
little about how babies and children grow and develop isn't a good
thing, knowing too much, Cohen says, also has its pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can lead parents to feel that unless they're absolutely
perfect, their kids are not going to reach their potential,'' he
says. ``No parent is going to be perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditto for baby, no matter how precocious. Indeed, after a decade
or so of magazine covers proclaiming the braininess of babies,
there's been a bit of a backlash.
</P>
<P>
   ``People went a little too far in asserting that infants were
little Einsteins,'' Cohen says. ``Hold on a minute, babies really
do develop. They're not geniuses out of the womb. I give a talk
called, 'Babies may be dumber than you think.' I like to tell
parents, `Your baby is developing slowly for important reasons.
Enjoy that development.'''
</P>
<P>
   And that's what we're doing, Katie and I _ enjoying her
development while a graduate assistant records her reaction to
changing faces on a video screen.
</P>
<P>
   Ding. Ding. Ding. When the bell sounds, a flashing green dot
grows bigger and bigger. Then a pleasing female face framed by long
blonde hair appears.
</P>
<P>
   The bell rings again, followed by another face, this time a girl
with curly brown hair.
</P>
<P>
   Katie, herself a brunette, clearly prefers the second face,
proclaiming, ``Dah, dah,'' and clapping her hands when the young
woman reappears.
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen, who is conducting this study, isn't interested in
facial preferences. He's trying to track when babies begin to
perceive faces in their entirety. As newborns, they don't see the
internal features of a face, only its outline.
</P>
<P>
   So Katie sees the first two faces over and over again, until her
interest starts to wane. Toward the end, instead of cooing with
delight, she's rubbing chubby little fingers in her eyes, thrusting
her head dangerously close to the floor to escape the interminable
ennui.
</P>
<P>
   But when the bell dings, Katie knows to take a look. And when a
face combining the internal features of one face with the outline
of the other appears, she perks up, looks longer. And there you
have it. If she couldn't see the eyes, nose and mouth, the melded
faces wouldn't mean much, would they?
</P>
<P>
   That's a conclusion I'm drawing. One of the caveats of
participating is that the researchers won't talk about how a child
(or the occasional adult drafted for studies about parenting) does.
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen's study, which should be completed by summer, already
has shown that by 7 months, most babies gaze longer at composite
faces, the way adults do.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted with 64 4- and 7-month-olds and dozens more
infants whose results were thrown out because of fussiness or other
complications, is scheduled to be replicated with infants who have
spina bifida and with babies with brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Katie and I stand ready to do duty again. Our
participation took all of 20 minutes; the lab even provides sitters
for siblings. Informal, at-home observations about what she can and
can't do continue, of course. (Lately, she does a little dancing
baby routine when her daddy whistles a tune, and she's most
enamored with a large yellow and green plastic cup.) How much is
too much when it comes to stimulating a baby's brain? Cohen says
most parents know instinctively.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important guideline is use your baby as a guide,'' he
says. ``If they're enjoying what you're doing, you're probably
doing the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Babies have this natural tendency to want to learn, but they
have to build their knowledge step by step.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Dan Scheinman joined Cisco Systems in 1992, he was a
neophyte in the ways of Silicon Valley. Leaving a job as an
associate at a law firm, he was offered his choice at Cisco of a
signing bonus or stock options in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Scheinman chose the sure thing _ the bonus. And as Cisco's stock
price, yoked to the growth of the Internet, soared over the years,
this ``goof,'' as he calls it, cost him roughly $700,000.
</P>
<P>
   So Scheinman, now the company's general counsel, has become a
true believer in the power of the stock options to create wealth.
``The bigger risk is not getting options,'' he said. ``Here, nobody
thinks about salary any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder, given the huge windfalls that many technology
stocks are providing employees _ and especially to certain top
technology executives. Though their salaries tend to be modest by
corporate standards, options are moving the leaders of companies
like Cisco and Yahoo rapidly up the ranks of the country's most
highly compensated chief executives, according to an analysis of
executive pay conducted for The New York Times' Money &AMP; Business
section.
</P>
<P>
   Big grants of options _ which give the holder the right to buy
shares at a set price for a specified time _ have long allowed
technology companies to lure and retain employees without diverting
cash from their own growth or damaging their often tenuous
profitability. And by doing so, they have done what shareholders
have demanded for a generation: linked management's interests to
investors'.
</P>
<P>
   But Silicon Valley's obsession with options _ an obsession
increasingly shared by the rest of Corporate America _ is
approaching an unhealthy extreme, according to some pay
consultants, recruiters and even investors. Like Internet bubble
babies, too many executives, these critics say, are focused on
stock performance and stock performance alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that concerns me the most is the trend toward
building market capitalization rather than building companies,''
said Roger McNamee, the founder of Integral Capital Partners, a
Menlo Park, Calif., investment company that has backed such
fast-growing companies as Rambus Inc. and Inktomi Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of option-rich pay packages and an overheated
market _ one where the performance of certain Internet highfliers
seems to have little to do with fundamental performance _ is
creating an employment environment that resembles a lottery,
according to pay experts.
</P>
<P>
   Critics warn that these packages, many of which let executives
quickly convert their options into stock, are not creating a loyal
work force focused on the long term. Instead, they may be
encouraging a short-term mindset by employees hoping to strike it
rich by joining companies whose stocks seem ready to soar.
</P>
<P>
   Companies have responded by offering even more options to keep
key workers, ratcheting the stakes higher and higher. ``It's upped
the ante for both executive talent and key engineering talent,''
said Steve Patchel, a senior consultant for Watson Wyatt Worldwide,
a pay and benefits consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   That route is being taken by many technology companies,
according to Graef Crystal, the editor of the crystalreport.com, an
Internet newsletter on executive pay, who conducted the study of
last year's executive compensation for The Times' Money &AMP; Business
section. When he looked at amounts being ladled out at a sampling
of technology companies with ties to the Internet, he found that
the average executive made more than twice as much as his
counterpart in the rest of Corporate America _ entirely because
many packages were stuffed with options.
</P>
<P>
   But Crystal's calculations take into account only the size of
the options grants themselves, not the rise in the companies'
stocks. ``Obviously, if you combine huge grant size with huge price
performance, you get the fourth movement of Beethoven's Ninth,
complete with a 350-voice chorus,'' Crystal said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the increase in the value of options in just the
last year put Timothy Koogle, chief executive of Yahoo, in nearly
the same pay league as John Welch of General Electric, even though
GE's $100 billion in sales is 500 times more than Yahoo's $200
million. Koogle, with total compensation of $22.7 million, ranks
among the 20 highest-paid executives in Crystal's study _ and that
does not count the one-year jump of nearly a half-billion dollars
in the value of his options. Not bad for someone who was brought in
to run the company less than four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As Koogle's case shows, it is no longer just the Bill Gateses of
the world who become enormously wealthy as technology booms.
Executives who played no role in starting a company are being given
stakes that provide them with wealth akin to that of founders who
had to stake everything on their dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are rewarding professional executives with entrepreneurial
rewards,'' said Pearl Meyer, the president of Pearl Meyer &AMP;
Partners, a New York consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo says Koogle was brought in very early to the company and
is largely responsible for its success. ``He put the first business
model in place,'' said Diane Hunt, a company spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The danger for businesses driven by high-spiraling stocks comes
in a market reversal _ a development that, for all technology's
power, many observers consider inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   The technology sector, of course, has always had its ups and
downs. But now many more people _ not just founders and top
executives, but workers on the corporate front lines _ hold options
and shares. That ties them for better and worse to the current
cycle. And many have never experienced the worse.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, many of the fresher faces in Silicon Valley ``have
begun to believe that they are worth the number'' they are now
earning, said Barry Obrand, who heads Silicon Area activities for
Russell Reynolds Associates, an executive search firm. If stocks
drop, he worries that many employees and executives will vanish as
quickly as the paper profits on their holdings. Companies could
have a hard time rebounding if key people depart.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, the issue is what will happen to employees who
have changed their life styles based on visions of a future
bonanza. Anyone buying an expensive house or car, and expecting to
cash in options to make the payments, could be in for a rude
awakening.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, stock options are viewed as an important way to
motivate employees and management. ``You work differently; you work
smarter,'' said Matt Ward, chief executive of WestWard Pay
Strategies, a consulting concern in San Francisco. ``Everybody's
there to get the mission accomplished'' _ that is, to bolster
shareholder returns.
</P>
<P>
   This mind-set is increasingly prevalent as companies across the
country embrace a similar philosophy. ``Options have become a
bigger and bigger part of the pay package,'' said Crystal, who said
options accounted for about half the total compensation paid to
executives in his survey of 428 large companies.
</P>
<P>
   But as large investors have begun to complain about how the
corporate printing presses ``keep running,'' as Crystal puts it,
there are signs that the huge increases in pay may be moderating.
While Crystal found that the median increase in compensation was
nearly 25 percent in 1997 for chief executives of the biggest
companies, it climbed only 10 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   The faithful in Silicon Valley are quick to assure cynics,
especially those from the other coast, that the ``money culture''
is not pervasive. ``We are building something that we want to be
around in 10 years,'' said Scheinman of Cisco, which makes Internet
networking equipment.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the executives running these companies are
representative of what some describe as Old Silicon Valley _
sharing an overarching belief in the ability of technology to
change the world _ executives will still work 100 hours a week to
try to get their latest products out on time, say defenders of the
industry's ways. And programmers will still devote hours to
perfecting a piece of code.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason you don't have to worry about this is that the
day-to-day environment is not about the stock price,'' said David
Peterschmidt, chief executive of Inktomi, an Internet software
company that has been among the hot upstarts of late. Since going
public in June, the stock has more than quadrupled.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, veterans say, it is well understood in Silicon
Valley that many of even the most promising companies fail. ``A lot
of people have a lot of worthless options as wallpaper in their
garage,'' said Ward of WestWard Pay. At Cisco, employees joke about
former colleagues who sought their fortunes at some of these
failures, Scheinman said, noting that ``plenty of e-commerce
companies have folded their tent.''
</P>
<P>
   But, oh the rewards _ if mostly only on paper _ for workers
whose companies are embraced by investors. Given the recent success
of Internet-related initial public offerings, companies that are
planning to go public can use options to give employees potential
for vast riches. ``Most of these Internet companies can get anyone
they want by dangling stock options,'' said Rick Gostyla, the head
of the North American high-technology practice of Spencer Stuart,
an executive search firm.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, an executive recruited by a start-up might get $20
million in options, according to David Kixmiller, a partner at
Heidrick &AMP; Struggles, another search firm. Today, the package is
likely to be worth $100 million. ``All the valuations are pushed up
higher in every stage of the deal,'' Kixmiller said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many pay packages no longer lock employees into
long-term relationships in order to collect the jackpots. Many
companies are granting options that can be converted into stock
relatively quickly, said Judith Fischer, the managing director of
Executive Compensation Advisory Services in Springfield, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Westly, a vice president at Ebay, the online auction
company whose stock has shot up 778 percent since its public
offering in September, was given options on roughly 2.4 million
shares at just 7 cents each when he joined the company in August
1997, according to company filings. Westly, who was free to
exercise the options immediately, has done so, according to the
filings. If he still holds the shares, he has a paper profit of
more than $330 million. Ebay had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Even when companies offer more traditional options, which vest
over several years, many allow a substantial fraction to be
exercised in short order. At Silicon Graphics and Inktomi, for
example, additional shares vest monthly.
</P>
<P>
   That is why few consultants still argue that options are a tool
to retain executives in Silicon Valleys. Companies lose as much as
a fifth of their work force each year, according to the Radford
division of Aon Consulting, which conducts an annual survey of
high-technology companies. If a competitor wants to hire someone
badly enough, it will simply offer enough new options to make up
for any money left behind, pay experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using a long-term incentive for short-term gains creates a
problem,'' said David Leach, a consultant with Compensation
Resource Group in New York. ``It certainly sends a message of short
term.''
</P>
<P>
   The siren call of options also penalizes companies whose stock
has already been very successful, like America Online or the
two-year-old Amazon.com or even corporate toddlers like Ebay. While
companies point to past stock performance in recruiting prospects,
a stock that has been TOO hot can make recruiting difficult. In
such cases, executives and other candidates turn pessimistic,
because ``their stock has only one way to go,'' explained Gostyla
of Spencer Stuart.
</P>
<P>
   And woe to any company whose stock starts to struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Graphics, which makes computer systems, has experienced
an exodus since its stock started performing poorly a few years
ago. To attract its new chief executive, Richard Belluzzo, from
Hewlett-Packard, the company offered him a yearly salary of just
under $1 million and 3 million stock options _ a fifth of which
vest after just 10 months on the job. So he could exercise his
Hewlett-Packard options, Silicon Graphics also gave Belluzo a
short-term loan, which he has repaid, according to the proxy
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``To attract the best talent, you have to be competitive with
the market,'' said John Cristofano, a spokesman for Silicon
Graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Like other technology companies with tumbling shares, Silicon
Graphics has reduced its options' prices twice in the last two
years. While many investors frown upon the practice, compensation
experts say such companies have little choice if they hope to keep
or attract key people.
</P>
<P>
   Companies ``feel that they cannot wait a year'' for the stock to
recover, Ms. Meyer said. ``If they wait more than a quarter, they
will have an outflow'' of essential workers.
</P>
<P>
   But the act of repricing options is being threatened by a change
in the rules governing how companies account for options. The
Financial Accounting Standards Board, the nation's accounting rule
maker, has proposed that repricing options result in a charge to
earnings if the stock price moves up. Many experts say this would
all but end the practice, because companies would be very reluctant
to incur the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Within technology companies, few people seem to resent the
enormous wealth being created in the Valley _ because that wealth
is being at least partly shared.
</P>
<P>
   That may be because many companies make a point of including all
their employees in option plans. A survey of Internet service
companies by WestWard Pay showed that half of workers making less
than $30,000 were eligible for options.
</P>
<P>
   While the proliferation of options is helping to keep the peace,
it also means that a much larger group of people will suffer in any
downturn.
</P>
<P>
   When Hewlett-Packard lost significant market value more than a
decade ago, employees did not head for the hills. ``They didn't
have stock options,'' said Kixmiller, the executive recruiter from
Heidrick &AMP; Struggles. ``Stock options were not as big a part of the
landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   So what will happen when today's landscape is bombarded by what
could be dozens of crashing stocks?
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know the answer,'' said Kixmiller. ``The valuation
placed on the Internet IPOs is unprecedented.''

HURRICANE FORECASTER PREDICTS ACTIVE STORM SEASON FOR '99 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Colo.)  (js) 
 By JIM CARRIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ This year's hurricane season in the Atlantic is
likely be ``very active'' with a chance of damaging storms striking
Florida and the East Coast, a leading hurricane forecaster said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   William Gray, an atmospheric scientist and hurricane expert at
Colorado State University, predicted that in the hurricane year
beginning June 1 there would be 14 tropical storms, with nine of
them hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the hurricanes could be major, Category 3 or higher,
meaning winds of at least 111 miles per hour on a scale of 1 to 5.
Hurricanes have winds of at least 74 mph, and tropical storm
warning are issued when winds reach 55 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Gray discussed his forecast at the annual meeting of the
National Hurricane Conference, an organization of hurricane
experts.
</P>
<P>
   Based on ``climate signals'' from stratospheric winds and warmer
currents in the north Atlantic, Gray said the ``odds are'' that the
1999 hurricane season could look like that of last year, when there
were 14 storms, 10 of them hurricanes, with three of them
classified as major.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said his hurricane-forecast record had been slightly better
than a simple projection of climatological records since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   From 1995 to 1998, there were 33 hurricanes, a record for a
four-year period. That could signal a return to a cycle of high
hurricane activity that lasts two or three decades, scientists at
the meeting said. The last such cycle was seen in the 1940s and
1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Gray also announced a new effort to estimate the sites where
hurricanes would strike. His preliminary calculations show that
Florida and the East Coast are 4.5 times more likely to get a major
storm this year than in the 1970-1994 period. The odds of a major
storm on the Gulf Coast are about the same as during that period,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Landsea, a research meteorologist at the federal
government's hurricane research division laboratory in Miami, said
the 1970s and 1980s appeared to have been one of the periodic
lulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been lucky,'' Landsea said. No major storm struck
Florida from 1965 to 1992 when Hurricane Andrew caused $33 billion
in damage. Since the 1960s, millions of people have moved to the
Eastern coastline and built expensive homes, which will make storm
damage much more costly, Landsea said.
</P>
<P>
   In Southeast Florida, for example, the population of Dade and
Broward counties has increased 600 percent between major storms.
``So it shouldn't come as a huge surprise that we have incredible
damages now,'' Landsea said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of more major storms striking the built-up coast
``scares me to death,'' said James Lee Witt, director of the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, who has been pushing pilot
programs to hurricane-proof homes and remove as many as 500 homes
from flood-prone areas. Hurricane damage in the United States last
year totaled $7.3 billion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The coastal situation is a ``time bomb,'' said Rade Musulin, a
vice president of Farm Bureau insurance concern in Florida. Musulin
said that many of the modern coastal houses were particularly
vulnerable, built with large windows, vaulted ceilings and pools.
</P>
<P>
   As the 1999 hurricane season approaches, experts are taking a
number of initiatives to improve warnings to coastlines. The
National Hurricane Center announced that it would issue gale
warnings up to six hours earlier, or 24 hours, rather than the
current 18.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jarrell, the director of the center, also urged Florida to
do something about ``the Key West problem,'' including the
construction of a four-lane highway all the way from Key West. When
Hurricane Georges, a Category II storm, struck last October, 30,000
people elected to stay on the Florida Keys. Computer models show
that in a Category IV storm, Key West would be under water, Jarrell
said. ``We would have massive casualties,'' he said.

 &HT;    A new life for old things
 &HT;    By Nicole Villalpando
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Wrought iron gates with rust around the edges.
Pine doors with scratches from a dog. Fireplace mantels with
peeling layers of blue, yellow and white paint. Stained glass
windows with rippling rich-colored panes.
</P>
<P>
   These objects, once destined for the junk yard, are being
transformed into trendy garden accents, wall hangings and
furniture. Homeowners are rummaging through antique stores, used
building supply stores and flea markets to find the perfect piece
of history _ one that will give their homes a flavor different from
the high-tech, high-gloss, modern world they inhabit.
</P>
<P>
   Buying old houses and fixing them up has become the trendy thing
to do, but with the cost of renovation rising and not as many old
homes on the market, some are putting old pieces into new homes to
capture the warmth of an older home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole generation of baby boomers that want to live
in an old house,'' said Brad Kittel of Discovery's ``From the
Past,'' (CQ) a used building supply store in Gonzales. ``They want
nostalgia. They're bored with cookie-cutter homes.''
</P>
<P>
   With old materials, homeowners can fashion several different
looks. They can go funky by hanging old windows, doors and wrought
iron on the wall instead of paintings. Or they can go traditional
by fitting a new home with stained glass windows, long leaf pine
doors and an iron fence.
</P>
<P>
   Some people strip, sand and refinish old pieces to bring them to
their original state. Others, like D'Ette Cole, enjoy the look of
aged materials, complete with scratches, chipped paint and rust.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really embrace the texture and patina of old pieces,'' said
Cole, owner of Uncommon Objects.
</P>
<P>
   She points to a a bookcase with paint that is ``alligatoring,''
a process that happens when paint crackles as it is exposed to
heat. ``That's hard to duplicate. To strip it would be a crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think they are beautiful as they are. The history a piece
implies _ it's kind of like someone's lost treasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding the right architectural antique can be like looking for
buried treasure, said Sebastian Simon, owner of L'Elysee Antiques.
``Part of the satisfaction is the hunt,'' Simon said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first places to start is local antique stores. Some,
such as Architects &AMP; Heroes and Pieces of the Past, specialize in
architectural antiques. Other antique stores may have a good
selection of one thing such as stained glass, but they may not have
a variety of other things. Shop around to become familiar with each
store's specialty.
</P>
<P>
   Attend events like flea markets, large garage sales and estate
sales. One large event, the Round Top Antique Fair, fills fields
with traditional and architectural antiques twice a year. The next
fair will be April 8-11. Call (409) 249-4042 for more information.
</P>
<P>
   Look for large warehouses for used building supplies. In Austin,
Habitat for Humanity runs its Re-Store, which carries new and used
building supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The quest for other used building supply warehouses may take you
out of town. Discovery's ``From the Past'' (CQ) offers 60,000
square feet of architectural antiques. Also look to bigger and
older cities such as Houston and San Antonio for such warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   Look around old neighborhoods and get to know demolition
companies. Most architectural antique dealers find merchandise
through these companies.
</P>
<P>
   But locating architectural antiques in Texas can be more of a
challenge than in other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas is not an old state,'' Kittel of Discovery's said.
``There's not a lot of cool old stuff here.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas' supply also has shrunk as more people renovate old houses
instead of selling them for parts, Kittel said. Most local stores
look for merchandise along the East Coast and in the Midwest. These
regions have buildings that predated the Industrial Revolution and
provided havens for immigrant craftsmen from Europe
</P>
<P>
   Knowing where to look is one thing; understanding what you're
buying is another. Some antique stores stock both old things and
replicas. The first thing to establish is that the object is old.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should really examine it,'' said Marc Elson of Architects
&AMP; Heroes. ``Turn it upside down. It's going to have some type of
flaw.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, the quality of a reproduction won't be as good as
the original, Elson said.
</P>
<P>
   The weight of an object can be a giveaway. Today's doors are
made of thin veneer. Old doors are solid wood. Old iron also will
be solid.
</P>
<P>
   Old wood will show its age by the number of growth rings in an
inch. Old wood has 16 to 30 lines in an inch; new wood will have
four to five lines per inch. The lines also may have darkened with
age, and the wood will have a patina. Expect old wood to be much
harder than new wood.
</P>
<P>
   The type of wood also shows its age. Long leaf pine, a popular
choice among old wood enthusiasts, hasn't been used commercially
since the 1930s. Pitch pine, used in old European doors, was cut
down in Europe by the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you see, the more you develop a kind of sixth
sense,'' said Charles Durham of Durham Trading &AMP; Design Co. ``You
look at the patina in the wood and start to get a feel of how it
was built a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's the way a piece was put together that gives away
its age. Wrought iron fences that have welding marks can't be more
than 60 to 70 years old because that was when welding was first
used. Older iron will have rivets or the pieces will slide together
in slots. ``You see much more detail in older pieces,'' said Kathy
Johnson of Pieces of the Past. ``You also know that that design
can't be duplicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Old stained glass features unsoldered lead joints instead of
soldered aluminum joints. The glass itself will be rippled and come
in more vibrant colors than the new clear glass.
</P>
<P>
   As unique as each old piece is, so is the price. Shop around to
find reputable dealers and to become educated on what's a good
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Even among well-known dealers, prices can vary. Stained glass
sells in Austin for between $45 and $1,000. Doors can be as little
as $35 for a plain, interior door to as much as $5,500 for a pair
of Italian walnut-and-iron exterior doors. Iron gates go for as
little as $60 to as much as $2,500. ``It all depends on the
source,'' said Elson of Architects and Heroes. ``Have they spent a
lot of time back-roading to out-of-the-way places? Did they find it
here in Austin or was it shipped in from somewhere else? Did they
take a plane or did they drive a truck?''
</P>
<P>
   Dealers often look at what the item would cost today if it could
be replicated. Durham points to a set of walnut doors priced at
$5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I could get these for less than $5,000 new,''
Durham said. ``I base it on a comparable set of new doors. And if
there's historical significance, that adds to the price.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost of making the piece usable should be considered.
Refinishing a claw foot tub with rust spots may cost $350, the same
amount spent on finding one in better shape. Stripping an old door
may add $50 to $75 to the cost of the door. Some dealers will allow
clients to take a piece home to live with it for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to visualize pieces until you get them there,''
Elson said. ``It's a good thing to let people try it and give them
options.''
</P>
<P>
   Choosing the right piece becomes personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people have a passion for what they buy,'' Elson said.
``Follow your instinct.''

   MORINI, Albania _ Hounded from their homes and herded by police
cars and tanks into columns that snake through the valleys of
southern Kosovo, the flood of refugees leaving the Serbian province
surged by more than 78,000 people Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 1.8 million ethnic Albanians who lived in Kosovo, more
than 310,000 of them have made the journey in the last 10 days to
Montenegro and to neighboring countries like Macedonia and Albania.
NATO officials estimated Friday that some 600,000 refugees still
inside Kosovo are slowly making their way out, and many are
destined for Albania, which has already received more refugees than
any other country.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the new refugees are expected to arrive over the next
several days at the tiny border crossing in this small mountain
town. Friday night, when the authorities closed the crossing here
at 9 p.m., long lines of refugees who were waiting to enter Albania
were forced to bed down in open, hostile Serb territory. As they
waited, the line grew constantly as Serb forces continued pushing
groups of refugees toward the border.
</P>
<P>
   But refugees from Kosovo are stepping from one nightmare into
another. Many have not had food or water for three or four days.
They have waited hours, even days, to get here, seeking safety,
shelter and food.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is precious little here. Food supplies are running
out. Water has been off and on during the day and electricity is
flickering.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is out of control. It is catastrophic,'' the
Albanian information minister, Musa Ulqini, said Friday as the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees declared ``a major humanitarian
emergency in northern Albania. Even as officials from the UNHCR
held a two-hour emergency meeting Friday night, some 5,000 more
refugees crossed the border here.
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Macedonia, 121,000 ethnic Albanian refugees have
streamed into the country, nearly 30 percent of them in the last 24
hours, increasing already-strained relations between ethnic groups
there. And, since last week, some 60,000 have made their way into
Montenegro, still a part of Yugoslavia but increasingly estranged
from its leader, Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are witnessing up there is something we have not seen
in Europe since World War II,'' said Andrea Angeli, a spokesman for
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is
helping coordinate the relief effort.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The small, ramshackle Albanian border town of Kukes, population
20,000, is being quickly overwhelmed by the flood of refugees
despite frantic efforts by Albanian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In an even tinier place, Kouma, with a normal population of
3,500, has swollen to 20,000 by taking in refugees from the Hass
Region, which straddles the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is only the tip of the iceberg,'' warned Eugene
O'Sullivan, head of the OSCE observer team as he struggled to find
more sanitation facilities, medical care and food for the even
larger number of refugees that is expected. ``We are reaching a
crisis and it is going to get worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Desperately needed here are more transport to ferry the
refugees, many of whom are on foot; food; a field kitchen, and
medical facilities to supplant the poorly equipped local hospital
where eight people have already died after the journey.
</P>
<P>
   The refugee problem is made even more difficult, O'Sullivan and
other aid workers said, because of the isolation of Kukes and the
surrounding area, which is reachable only by a single, crumbling
road that twists and turns dizzily over the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   It is about a six-hour trip from the capital, Tirana, in the
best of times, but now the narrow road itself is clogged with
refugees moving south, most of them in slow-moving farm tractors
pulling carts full of women and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Kukes District, the situation has become absolutely
critical,'' Ulqini, the information minister, said. ``During the
night and up to this morning the influx of Albanians in need of
help coming from Kosovo has been extraordinary. The situation is
rapidly getting worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every household in town has taken in refugees,
sometimes by the dozens, with people sleeping on floors. Others are
packed along the cold concrete floor of a school, gathered in front
of a mosque or in a truck repair lot. Many of those arriving in the
past few nights have been sleeping in open fields, raising fears
among relief workers of cholera unless latrines are dug.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an emergency within an emergency,'' said Angeli the
OSCE spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the difficulty getting supplies here, the first
concern of the relief effort has been to move the refugees out of
the mountains and into tent camps or existing refugee shelters near
Tirana or the Adriatic Sea port of Durres.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian government mobilized buses in the first few days
and successfully brought many of the first wave of refugees out of
the mountains, but the effort has lagged in the past few days even
as the refugee flow has mounted.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, the Albanian government ordered all of its idle
trucks into the mountains to transport people. But even mercenary
cabdrivers from Tirana who hoped to make money carrying refugees
were dismayed by the broken and pot-holed road. ``If I had known
the roads were like this, I never would have come,'' one cabdriver
told a friend. ``Any money I make will go to fix the car.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been little advance planning among relief agencies for
the refugee crisis, apparently because, relief workers said
privately, when this year's budgets were being planned, the
agencies were lulled into the belief that talks between Milosevic
and the West would be successful. Such talks have rarely led to
progress in the past.

BAFFERT AN IDEAL AMBASSADOR FOR HORSE RACING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The torch is still in Bob Baffert's hand --
burning like a junkyard blaze for thoroughbred racing's hottest
Triple Crown trainer.
</P>
<P>
   It may all turn to mere glowing embers before this summer is
through -- but for the past two years Baffert has been a wonderful
ambassador for a sport in need of a recognizable figure.
</P>
<P>
   He's charismatic, handsome, quote-worthy, and just happens to be
in position to become the first trainer in history to saddle three
straight Kentucky Derby champions.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure you say. What pressure?
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go for four in a row, that's when the pressure
starts,'' Baffert joked recently.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Baffert sends out two of his Kentucky hopefuls as Prime
Timber and General Challenge meet a field of eight in the $750,000
Santa Anita Derby -- the same prep race that produced Baffert's
past two Kentucky Derby Champions, Silver Charm and Real Quiet,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Both Silver Charm and Real Quiet went on to win the Preakness,
giving Baffert a chance at racing's most coveted prize, the Triple
Crown. Both, however, came up short at Belmont. Silver Charm by a
half-length; Real Quiet by a nose.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on Baffert to win an unprecedented third straight
Kentucky Derby is not what one might think, however. The most
pressure he felt came when he took Silver Charm to Churchill Downs.
A year earlier he saddled Cavonnier to a second-place finish in the
1996 Kentucky Derby, losing a photo-finish to Grindstone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of pressure on myself with Silver Charm
because I had just got beaten by a dirty nose (to Grindstone) right
on the wire,'' Baffert said. ``It was the most devastating loss of
my career.
</P>
<P>
   ``But once you win a Derby, especially two, it's different the
next time. If I was coming in here with three seconds in a row,
then I would feel heavy duty pressure. Guys would be asking `can
you get it done.' It's like the Broncos going to the Super Bowl all
those years. But now that I've got it, I can have fun now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what has to be done. You need a lot of luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert insists all his recent success hasn't changed him, only
the people around him have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't really changed,'' he said. ``They (the media) want
me to be (ready to talk) all the time. I'm trying to promote
racing, but I cannot be (available) all the time. And when I'm not,
they say `what's wrong with this guy.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like when I drive up to the barn and I see all these
camera's and I say `oh my God, here we go again.' I feel like that
movie Analyze This. Maybe I need a (shrink).''
</P>
<P>
   It has almost come to the point where Baffert is expected to
saddle a Kentucky Derby champion every first week in May. He has
raised the bar on himself by competing for the Triple Crown the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (the fans) expect me to be there (Kentucky) and be
competitive,'' said Baffert. ``I have my little following and my
fans, but a lot of people don't think like the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the media puts that (pressure to win) out more than
anybody else. They expect me to win it (Kentucky Derby), but not
the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Silver Charm and Real Quiet finished second in the past two
Santa Anita Derbies before winning at Kentucky. Last year's Santa
Anita Derby winner, Indian Charlie, was another from the Baffert
barn.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert started this season with a handful of hopefuls for this
year's Derby -- but his realistic chances of sending a bonafide
contender to Kentucky may stem from today's race.
</P>
<P>
   He has two three-year-old fillies, Excellent Meeting and
Silverbulletday running at other tracks this weekend, but he says
both will likely skip Churchill Downs in favor of the Kentucky
Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   Another promising three-year-old, Straight Man, suffered his
first loss recently and this year's winter-book favorite from the
Baffert barn, Exploit, was injured and retired following the Grade
II San Felipe Stakes with a chipped knee.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Baffert with General Challenge and Prime Timber,
whom he said could finish one-two in today's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, they're at home at Santa Anita and that's why they're
running together,'' he said. ``It's possible they could finish
first and second, but Desert Hero might be a good horse and Bobby's
(Frankel) really high on Honest Lady. Overall, this is one of the
toughest years I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge will wear blinkers for the first time in his
first start since finishing fifth in the 1 1/16-mile Louisiana
Derby March 14 at the Fair Grounds for his only loss in four
starts.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert has dubbed General Challenge, ``The Rodman'' of his
barn.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how (Dennis) Rodman runs across the court, with all
legs, that's kind of how General Challenge moves,'' Baffert said.
``He didn't show up last time (finishing second) so that's when he
got the nickname.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know he's (General Challenge) a gelding. He's got a
feminine side to him that Rodman can relate to.''
</P>
<P>
   His other hopeful, Prime Timber, has never been worse than
second in six career starts. In Prime Timber's last start, he beat
the previously unbeaten Exploit in the San Felipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Prime Timber would be the favorite (today) after his
last race,'' said Baffert. ``He ran an incredible race. He runs
that race back again he's a galloping winner (today).''

SCHOOL CRISIS CHIPS AWAY AT NEW HAMPSHIRE'S ANTI-TAX STANCE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Does this sound like the New Hampshire known for its ferocious
aversion to taxes?
</P>
<P>
   Polls have found that when New Hampshire residents are asked how
the state should respond to a court decision requiring it to end
its heavy reliance on local property taxes to pay for schools,
hefty proportions favor an income tax.
</P>
<P>
   The school financial crisis is now in overtime. Despite marathon
sessions, lawmakers missed their court-imposed April 1 deadline to
come up with a new system, and no one here is predicting
confidently when or how it will end.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled state House of Representatives passed
a bill three weeks ago that would have established a 3.5 percent
income tax. The state Senate, which turned majority-Democrat last
November for the first time since 1912, passed its own version late
last month, but the House backtracked last Tuesday and rejected the
Senate version.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic governor, Jeanne Shaheen, true to her pledge to
resist sweeping new taxes, has vowed to veto any income tax _ a
veto that is not likely to be overridden. And teachers are
beginning to receive warning slips that their jobs may be in
question next fall.
</P>
<P>
   But one fact has emerged clearly from the muddle: New Hampshire
no longer seems such a granite monolith of anti-tax sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of only two states without an income or sales tax.
(The other is Alaska, which is entertaining an income tax proposal
of its own.) But the school-financing issue has brought out signs
that the ``Live Free or Die'' sentiment that is emblazoned on New
Hampshire's license plates, and that has long influenced the
state's first-in-the-nation presidential primary, may be mellowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to exaggerate the changes,'' said John Camobreco,
an assistant professor of political science at the University of
New Hampshire who specializes in state politics. ``But there are
significantly more people, I think, who sort of see that whole
`pledge' and the whole anti-income tax thing as sort of
antiquated.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``pledge'' embodies the essence of New Hampshire's anti-tax
sentiment. For state politicians, it is the pledge to oppose any
sales or income tax, and most candidates have taken the pledge
since the state's largest newspaper, the conservative Manchester
Union Leader, began insisting on it in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential contenders here are prodded to make a parallel
federal commitment to low taxes, and New Hampshire's tax phobia
thus translates into a national advantage for anti-tax candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But the pledge has come under such a heavy attack as the
Statehouse strives to solve its school-financing conundrum that
even a Republican state senator, James Squires, was quoted in The
Union Leader as saying that the pledge ``stifles our thinking and
diminishes our capacity for logic.''
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic state senator, Katherine Wells Wheeler, said New
Hampshire's tax structure ``for a long time was set by one
newspaper,'' referring to The Union Leader. ``All evidence
indicates that newspaper is losing its influence,'' she added, and
that ``is helping to allow people to think more independently.''
</P>
<P>
   The tax question has also brought to the fore the voices of
income tax supporters who normally kept quiet, said Fran Chapman,
chairman of the Granite State Taxpayers Inc., a taxpayers'
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happened is some people were scared to talk about it,
and now they're saying, `Let's get out there and do it,''' Chapman
said.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to spur this debate was a decision by the New
Hampshire Supreme Court in 1997 that the state's system of paying
for its schools almost entirely locally, with spending-per-pupil
varying significantly from town to town, was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The decision threw this state of 1.2 million people into the
kind of dilemma that about 30 other states have faced. New
Hampshire is very much like the rest of the country, said Clark
Hubbard, a political science professor at the University of New
Hampshire, in that ``everybody wants good services and nobody wants
to pay for them.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a way, everything matters a bit more here, because this
is the staging ground for future presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard said that in next year's primaries, ``I wouldn't predict
a major backing away from the tax pledge just because it's almost a
cultural part of the primary now and so it has kind of a
traditional ring to it.'' But he added, ``It may be, over the next
couple of election cycles, that New Hampshire will no longer be
able to claim that special tax-exempt status, and will begin to put
less emphasis on taxes as a presidential issue.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The national candidates who are now starting to campaign here
will be stepping into the school-financing crisis at their own
risk.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Shaheen, the state chairman for Vice President Al Gore's
campaign, said that Gore ``basically asked me what he should say,
and I said, `What do you think you should say?' And his response
was absolutely correct, that this was a local issue and should be
decided by the local people of New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   A yet unanswered question, however, is whether the candidates
will conclude that New Hampshire is perhaps not as
libertarian-leaning as they had thought, and will tailor their
campaigns accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   The basis for such a conclusion is the idea that the income tax
sentiment is a sign of demographic change. For a generation, New
Hampshire has been the fastest-growing state in New England; its
population nearly doubled in the last 30 years as it transformed
itself from a farm-and-mill backwater to a high-tech powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Well over half the state's residents came from elsewhere, many
from places where they had become used to much heavier and
broader-based taxes. So the prospect of an income tax, the theory
goes, holds little terror for them.
</P>
<P>
   But a countertheory holds that the newer residents sought to
escape high taxes elsewhere, and so they are more likely to oppose
an income tax. State Sen. Beverly Hollingworth, a Democrat, said,
``When you talk to the native New Hampshire people, they are the
ones in general who support making change and providing for
education.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Wells Wheeler puts it this way: ``We're maturing. We're
realizing our social obligations. We're realizing we can't live
independently with just a barn-raising to help our neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Also influencing the discussion, some say, is the growing
emphasis on education, as demonstrated in polls showing it is the
No. 1 issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature has been examining dozens of plans for raising
the $1 billion or so to pay for public schools. Some have included
a statewide property tax; others have involved gambling taxes,
business taxes and entertainment taxes. New Hampshire already has
one of the highest property tax burdens in the nation, and much of
the discussion has focused on how best to shift that load.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts expect the Legislature to pass some kind of
solution in the next two weeks or so _ even if only a provisional
plan for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Though the court decision carried no explicit penalty for
missing the deadline, as of Thursday, the start of the new
financial year, it became illegal for towns to collect local
property taxes for schools. That means all kinds of possible
complications for the next school year, from hiring teachers to
sending out tax bills. School administrators look with dread toward
July 1, when money will run out unless the Legislature comes up
with a workable plan.
</P>
<P>
   The state's consideration of tax plans has frazzled lawmakers
but has provided a fabulous civics lesson at meetings and debates
throughout New Hampshire, said Chapman of the Granite State
Taxpayers. One forum was so lively it reminded him of a revival
meeting, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Camobreco, at the University of New Hampshire, said that in the
end, new light may be cast on the nature of New Hampshire, but it
is important to be wary of ascribing major change to the state's
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there are people who voted for an income tax,'' he said.
``But they never would've gotten a chance to cast that vote without
the Supreme Court _ never in a million years.''

DIFFERENCES CAN ALSO BRING FAITHS CLOSER TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year after a much-criticized Vatican document on the
Holocaust, Jewish and Christian scholars find even its weaknesses a
tool of reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, on the brink of a week when Jews and Christians
were to remember and re-enact core moments of their faiths, it was
appropriate that Jewish and Christian scholars should gather to
discuss a document called ``We Remember.''
</P>
<P>
   That document's full title, of course, was ``We Remember: A
Reflection on the Shoah.'' When it was issued, a little more than a
year ago, by the Vatican's Commission for Religious Relations With
the Jews, the disappointment among many was palpable.
</P>
<P>
   True, the document was introduced by a moving letter from Pope
John Paul II, who called the Holocaust ``an indelible stain on the
history of the century'' and urged Catholics to ``purify their
hearts, through repentance,'' and to ``examine themselves on the
responsibility which they too have for the evils of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   The document itself called on Catholics to repent of Christian
contributions to the Holocaust, asking them to replace all traces
of Christian anti-Judaism with an awareness of their own faith's
Hebrew roots and with a new, mutually respectful relationship with
the Jewish people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spoiled seeds of anti-Judaism and anti-Semitism,'' the
document concluded, ``must never again be allowed to take root in
any human heart.''
</P>
<P>
   For many readers, though, both Catholic and Jewish, those
powerful appeals were undercut by passages that seemed worded more
to exonerate the church than to take responsibility or inspire
repentance.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if a heartfelt appeal had fallen into the hands of
legal experts whose job it was to protect Catholicism from the
theological equivalent of civil suits.
</P>
<P>
   That is probably not the way that Cardinal Edward Cassidy, the
Vatican official who signed ``We Remember'' as president of the
Commission for Religious Relations With the Jews, would express it.
</P>
<P>
   But at this week's consultation of scholars, which took place
from Sunday through Tuesday in Chicago and was co-sponsored by the
Cardinal Joseph Bernardin Center for Theology and Ministry and the
Tanenbaum Center for Interreligious Understanding, Cassidy gave
more than one indication of the Vatican gantlet his document had to
run.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest difficulty was the fear that if you say the
church has been wrong in the past, then it can be wrong today and
tomorrow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy offered that comment during a discussion of an aspect of
``We Remember'' that had stirred criticism: its distinction between
the church itself and its sinful members.
</P>
<P>
   In previous talks as well as in a public address during the
Chicago meeting, he maintained that this distinction was not meant
to shield the highest church authorities while pointing a finger at
the failings of ordinary Christians.
</P>
<P>
   The ``sinful sons and daughters'' of the church, he made clear,
could include not only laity but also popes, cardinals, bishops and
``even renowned teachers of faith'' _ whoever had fostered mistrust
and hostility toward Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was this distinction meant to avoid a kind of collective
responsibility, he explained, for just as Catholics understand that
they are linked to the merits of their saints, they are similarly
linked to the sins of their wrongdoers.
</P>
<P>
   That did not end the consultation's pursuit of the question,
however. The Catholic scholars recognized the weight of
longstanding images of the church _ mystical body, bride of Christ,
spotless lamb _ all pointing to a sinless, divine dimension beyond
the human weaknesses of its members.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish scholars acknowledged that there were analogous
mystical, transcendent understandings of the covenanted people. But
both groups remained troubled by the way such conceptions might
float above history and humanity _ and responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Did the distinction between the sinless church and its
potentially sinful members, one participant asked, not dissolve
corporate responsibility into individual biography? Did the
distinction, others asked, not leave unattended the harmful
influences no longer associated with any individual church members
but institutionalized and embedded in art, liturgies, popular
devotions, widespread teachings and church decrees?
</P>
<P>
   The group was just as unrelenting in its pursuit of other
aspects of ``We Remember'' that had raised objections: first, its
sharp distinction between Christian anti-Judaism and modern
anti-Semitism, especially Nazi anti-Semitism, with ``its roots
outside of Christianity''; and second, its unqualified defense of
Pope Pius XII, whose policies in regard to the Holocaust are still
contested.
</P>
<P>
   The very vigor of the discussion revealed a deep confidence that
Catholic-Jewish relations had taken a decisive turn and now stood
on a new footing. Opinions never broke down along religious lines.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the question was theological or historical, whether the
topic was anti-Jewish statements of the church fathers or Vatican
diplomacy in 1942, there was more convergence than divergence, more
search for precise, nuanced positions than for contrasting
extremes.
</P>
<P>
   And encouraged by Cassidy's obvious willingness to listen and by
the knowledge that Catholic-Jewish dialogue was now implanted in
many local centers, participants concluded that even the
shortcomings of ``We Remember,'' no less than its strengths, might
be turned to the good purposes of further probing conversations.
</P>
<P>
   There is, after all, a calm determination as well as an
acknowledgment of human limitation to be found in a phrase that
Rabbi Irving Greenberg, president of the Jewish Life Network,
offered to the consultation: ``After Auschwitz, there can be no
final solutions, even theological ones.''

NEW CLEVELAND BROWNS RUSHING INTO EXISTENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEREA, Ohio _ Al Lerner recently watched his first indoor
practice and nearly got trampled. Lerner, the billionaire owner of
the expansion Cleveland Browns, lingered on a sideline, his hands
in his pants pockets, when halfback Malcolm Thomas raced full speed
toward him.
</P>
<P>
   Carmen Policy, the team's president and part owner, pushed
Lerner to safety. ``Al was reluctant to go,'' Policy said later,
``and I dragged him there. I said it would be fun. All I could
think of was visiting him at the Cleveland Clinic, his leg up in
traction, and he says, `For this, I paid $530 million?'''
</P>
<P>
   What Lerner saw of his huge investment were 73 men _ expansion
draftees, free agents and trade acquisitions _ in brown, white and
orange, scrimmaging with unusual ardor as cameras above one end
zone and at midfield recorded every movement of the
team-in-progress.
</P>
<P>
   In his first NFL head coaching job, Chris Palmer prowled the
artificial turf, windmilling his right arm, urging the players to
move faster, then faster. Running back Terry Kirby wondered about
the raw intensity of this first practice, in shorts and no pads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was shocking,'' said Kirby, a free-agent acquisition.
``This is March. Isn't March Madness supposed to be about
basketball? No, obviously this March Madness is football madness.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what Lerner, a 65-year-old banker, got for his $530
million on the first day of minicamp. ``Being involved in football,
sitting at the edge of my seat waiting for the first game, is all
good stuff,'' he said. Lerner is poker-faced; Policy, garrulous.
Lerner needed Policy's football acumen. Policy is enamored of
Lerner's desire to spend lavishly. They frequently set up each
other's sentences and thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are learning very quickly,'' Policy said, ``that you
have to know what you're talking about with him, and there's no
shame in saying, `I don't know.'''
</P>
<P>
   Once Lerner entered the Browns sweepstakes, he became the
prohibitive favorite. The wealthiest of the bidders, Lerner is a
friend of Commissioner Paul Tagliabue of the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   As a limited partner in the old Browns, he counseled Art Modell
to take them to Baltimore as the Ravens in 1996. After a period of
public reproval for aiding Modell, he is adapting to the type of
public role he has never led as the chairman of the MBNA
Corporation, the nation's third-largest credit card lender.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to walk in and out of restaurants or go to public
places,'' he said at a conference room table in Policy's office.
``Would I like to go back to my life of quiet desperation? I'd like
to, but it's OK''
</P>
<P>
   ``He isn't comfortable with it,'' Policy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I do the drill,'' Lerner said.
</P>
<P>
   For a city that mourned and raged when Modell fled to Baltimore,
this team-in-formation will do quite fine. And Lou Groza likes what
he sees. Groza, the legendary kicker for the original Browns who is
now 75, watched the practice from a chair far from the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a relative coming home,'' Groza said.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, the new Browns and the Browns-turned-Ravens are
division rivals and will play each other twice a year. Their first
meeting is Sept. 26 in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The return of the Browns is an NFL success story in the modern
era of stadium-driven sports economics.
</P>
<P>
   It began with Modell's secret talks with Maryland officials,
escalated into angry protests that forced Modell's permanent exile
from Cleveland and provoked Capitol Hill hearings about franchise
relocation and concern that the NFL could do nothing to prevent
carpetbagging by teams.
</P>
<P>
   The saga ended with an agreement to reseed the Browns as an
expansion team, build a publicly financed stadium for $283 million
(with nearly all revenue going to the team) and orchestrate a
high-profile auction, which led to Lerner's buying the team for
what was then a record sum. (The $800 million sale of the
Washington Redskins to a group led by the New York real estate
magnate Howard Milstein is pending.)
</P>
<P>
   ``If you gave me a team for free in any other city, I wouldn't
take it,'' Lerner said. ``This is the only team I have any
intention to own.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a game played, every seat, luxury box and club seat in
the stadium is sold out. Combine the stadium cash with $58.1
million in network television money this year (and steadily more in
each year thereafter), and profitability looks imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll make a profit,'' Lerner said. ``But do you produce a
return as good as a government bond? Not for a long time. But you
can't watch your T-bills play. This is a business, but it's not a
business. You have to win. It wouldn't be a success if it only made
money.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The rebirth of the Browns introduces high expectations, which
Lerner is underwriting with his desire to spend what is necessary
for talent; to rebuild five outdoor practice fields and redo the
Berea headquarters for $2 million, and to restock a weight room
left empty when Modell left.
</P>
<P>
   But the hopes are fueled by the near-instant prosperity of the
previous expansion teams, the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Carolina
Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   After coming to life in 1994, they played in their conferences'
championship games the next season. Never mind that Jacksonville
and Carolina had nearly two years to prepare for their first
college draft and the Browns barely six months.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the Browns are not guaranteed top draft picks in
their second season, as their expansion predecessors did. And never
mind that Lerner, Policy and Dwight Clark, the vice president for
football operations, have never built an expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more difficult than I thought,'' said Policy, the
former San Francisco 49ers president, who has a 10 percent stake in
the team. ``Managing the 49ers during the '90s is entirely
different from what we're experiencing now. We had a structure in
place. We had to maintain, fine-tune and improve it. But it's
daunting to start from nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Browns, the future is virtually now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be competitive in Year 2 or 3,'' said Clark, whom
Policy brought from San Francisco and who has imported 12 former
49ers. ``We have higher expectations than the people outside this
building.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1999 win-loss record is of low priority, at least to the
architects,'' Policy said. ``We want to compete for the AFC Central
championship in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Lerner: ``They have to be realistic. I don't. I want to win
every game.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, 49, who was hired for his teaching skills, started his
quest to become a head coach a year ago. He was a head coach at
Boston University and the University of New Haven, but an assistant
since then with the Houston Oilers, the New England Patriots and
Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're close to 50, your options start to dry up,'' he
said, sitting in a rented black chair in his office. His work with
the Patriots and Jaguars, especially with young quarterbacks, was
known to other teams, but he was not on the top rung of Cleveland's
coaching candidates. Still, his ``token'' interview with Policy and
Lerner went unexpectedly well, and he was hired for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville coach Tom Coughlin, Palmer's boss from 1997 to
1998, advised him, ``Get going, you're already behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer knows about high expectations. He is reminded of them
when he sees how little time he has to invest the team with
chemistry and discipline and satisfy fans who have waited three
years to see their Browns. He knows it from the task of dealing
with his assistant coaches, most of whom he has never worked with.
He knows it from the bus driver who shouted at him, ``Take the
quarterback, it's what you know,'' regarding the April 17 college
draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the real world,'' Palmer said. ``I go to lunch in
a place near here and you see a sign that says, `154 days until
Browns football,' and I can't enjoy lunch very much. We have two
years to win.''
</P>
<P>
   How quickly the Browns win may depend on whom they choose with
the expected No. 1 pick in the draft. It could be a quarterback,
like Tim Couch of Kentucky or Akili Smith of Oregon, or it could be
the Heisman Trophy-winning running back Ricky Williams of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   That top choice _ and others _ would add to to the core built
through the expansion draft (with onetime Browns cornerback Antonio
Langham the main pickup), free agency (Kirby, free safety Marquez
Pope, offensive tackle Lomas Brown and defensive tackle John
Jurkovic) and trades (quarterback Ty Detmer, defensive lineman Roy
Barker and tight end Irv Smith, all from the 49ers, who were
clearing salary-cap room, center Dave Wohlabaugh and linebacker
Chris Spielman).
</P>
<P>
   ``If one of those quarterbacks can take us all the way, we have
to take him,'' said Clark, ``even if he goes through what Peyton
Manning did.'' But Clark remembers how Joe Montana broke in with
the 49ers under coach Bill Walsh: ``Bill had Joe watch until he
started for the first time in the middle of the second season.''
</P>
<P>
   Couch seemed like the Browns' certain choice until Smith's
workout with the team raised his profile. The Browns could deal
their top pick; New Orleans Saints coach Mike Ditka has offered all
his draft picks to leap into the first or second slot and take
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision on the first pick will affect me more than anyone
else,'' Palmer said. ``If it's a good pick, I get to stay a while.
If it's not, I don't. I just want to be the first Browns coach to
get a contract extension.''
</P>
<P>
   All he need do is mold Couch (or Smith) into a Lake Erie version
of Montana, take the Browns to the AFC championship game in 2001,
and turn Al Lerner's $530 million gamble into a sure thing.

EDITORIAL: THE SECOND FRONT IN THE BALKANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, April 3:
</P>
<P>
   The torrent of refugees surging out of Kosovo has overwhelmed
the international effort to help them. If more assistance is not
rushed to the region by the United States and its European allies,
thousands of lives will be imperiled. President Clinton's pledge of
more financial aid for humanitarian organizations is welcome, but
the scale of the exodus requires the immediate mobilization of U.S.
and European governmental resources to transport water, food,
clothing, medicine and temporary shelter to the regions that border
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the upheavals of the Second World War has Europe
witnessed such a mammoth and sudden flood of refugees. In the last
week, more than three-quarters of a million ethnic Albanians have
been driven from their homes and villages in Kosovo by marauding
Serbian forces, and some 250,000 of them have already streamed
across the border into neighboring Albania, Macedonia and
Montenegro, another province of Yugoslavia. Tens of thousands are
backed up waiting to cross the frontier, huddled in the hills and
pastures without water and food in lines that extend 10 miles or
more back into Kosovo. The scenes in Albania of crying,
malnourished children, exhausted women clutching their infants and
old men reaching weakly for a slice of bread testify powerfully to
the urgent need for assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The exodus has put an unbearable burden on Albania, Macedonia
and Montenegro, three of the poorest lands in Europe. All three are
threatening to close their borders. As the number of refugees has
mounted in recent days, supplies of water and food have run short
in some places, and thousands of displaced people were left
yesterday without any help. Disease and death will soon stalk these
refugee encampments if aid is not available.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met with relief organizations on Frirday, promising more
money and logistical support from NATO troops in Macedonia, but
this is not enough. Clinton must order the Pentagon to organize a
U.S. airlift of supplies to the region and send troops to the
border region to help distribute the aid and to construct temporary
shelters.
</P>
<P>
   European nations, for their part, must send assistance and
provide temporary sanctuary for some of the refugees. Britain,
France, Germany, Greece, Turkey and other nations cannot duck this
responsibility. Conditions in Kosovo will eventually improve and
the ethnic Albanians will be able to return home, but it may take
months to create the security and political arrangements for
repatriation. Until then, the governments of Albania, Macedonia and
Montenegro will need large infusions of financial assistance.
Montenegro is especially vulnerable because it is a relatively
independent and democratic republic within Slobodan Milosevic's
domain. He is already moving to assert greater control, and Serbian
forces may soon be headed there.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the brutality of Milosevic's troops, the conflict in
Kosovo has created a refugee crisis in the Balkans that threatens
to destabilize the region. Dealing with it, and preserving the
lives of hundreds of thousands of desperate people, are no less
important than crippling the Serbian military in Kosovo.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, As allied forces prepared their attack on downtown
Belgrade Friday, the White House warned President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia that he had ``barely begun'' to feel NATO's
bombers and cruise missiles attack.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to halt any public doubts after 10 days of on-again,
off-again bombing of Yugoslavia, President Clinton sought to assure
Americans that the campaign against Milosevic would succeed. The
bombing has so far done nothing to halt the Serbian advance through
Kosovo province and the flood of refugees into neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
   And the White House sent a clear signal that it was turning the
attack more directly on the Yugoslav leader and his high command.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic has barely begun to incur the damage he will feel to
his military and police and the security apparatus by which he
keeps his dictatorship in power,'' Vice President Al Gore told
reporters after a lengthy late-afternoon national security
briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, President Clinton, too, warned that
Milosevic would pay a heavy price for continuing his policy of
``ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said that despite the exodus of refugees from
Kosovo, the military and political objectives of the Western allies
were still attainable with an air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we have quite a good chance of achieving our
objectives of the return of the Kosovars to live in security with a
measure of self-government,'' Clinton told reporters Friday as he
made a hastily announced appearance in the White House briefing
room.
</P>
<P>
   Gore described Milosevic's activity as so ``morally
unacceptable'' that the bombing would be so extensive, that a
political settlement might be moot. ``Whether or not a negotiation
with Milosevic is ever again possible,'' he said, ``that's an open
question, frankly, because he has perpetrated these horrible crimes
against humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Expressing confidence that the bombing would succeed, Gore added
of Milosevic: ``He has forced many of those people from their homes
before, and they have returned. These, too, will return.''
</P>
<P>
   The president spoke before the announcement Friday night that
NATO missiles had hit downtown Belgrade. Earlier this week he had
approved a target list for the NATO strikes that included
ministerial buildings and headquarters in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday afternoon Clinton suggested that the framework of the
failed peace talks in France would still serve as the basis for any
settlement, and that NATO _ and the United States _ would help the
refugees return to Kosovo and provide for their protection. For the
Kosovars to live with some degree of autonomy, he said, ``will
require, clearly, for some period of time, some sort of
international force that will be able to protect their security.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I think there will have to be some sort of security
arrangement in order for them to live safely. And then there will
have to be some sort of agreement that entails the autonomy to
which they are entitled.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the administration has been privately considering
a plan under which NATO troops would escort ethnic Albanians back
into Kosovo after Serbian forces there had been routed by bombing,
and would set up a self-governing enclave under allied protection,
NATO officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday Clinton still seemed frustrated by the difficulty in
explaining the mission, its objectives and its ramifications.
``Everyone is trying to get their hands around a very complex
problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president is measuring his responses to the Balkan war and
also publicly engaging in other matters. He talked at the briefing
Friday about the new unemployment figures, the lowest since 1970.
He is planning a trip to Philadelphia next week to discuss health
care. And he will be welcoming the Chinese prime minister to
Washington next week as critical talks continue on China's entry
into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls taken before the missile strikes Friday
show that a bare majority of the American public supported the air
strikes but that most believed NATO would not achieve its
objectives.
</P>
<P>
   A CBS News poll taken Wednesday after three American soldiers
were taken prisoner by the Serbs showed that 51 percent supported
the bombing and 34 percent opposed it. But a recent survey by CNN,
USA Today and Gallup found that only 41 percent thought NATO would
accomplish its objectives while 47 percent said it would not.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton insisted Friday that Kosovo was not lost, but he also
focused on the humanitarian relief efforts that have been under way
there for a year. With television images of Kosovo refugees
streaming across the border with Albania and Macedonia, Clinton
continued to try to dispel the notion that the NATO bombing had
escalated Milosevic's violence against ethnic Albanians and
prompted the exodus.
</P>
<P>
   He said relief worker she met with Friday had told him that the
refugees supported the bombing and clearly understood ``that that
action did not provoke the attempt to remove them from their
homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Asking other countries to help with the relief effort, Clinton
sought to use the plight of the displaced people to dramatize the
need for the continued air strikes. ``There's no doubt that what
Milosevic wants to do is to keep the land of Kosovo and rid it of
its people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He brought with him to the briefing several government officials
to reinforce the idea that the exodus from Kosovo had been going on
for some time. Hattie Babbitt, deputy administrator of the U.S.
Agency for International Development, said of the exodus: ``It's
not a new phenomenon. There's a new urgency to it, there's a new
scale to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Julia Taft, assistant secretary of state for population,
refugees and migration, called Milosevic's attacks on Kosovars a
``pogrom'' and said that the government had been working with
relief agencies for more than a year to respond to the uprooting.
The United States has sent $91 million to the region since last
year, and Clinton authorized $50 million more on Wednesday,
officials said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Even after a 30 percent jump in crude oil prices last month,
Terry Smith, the general manager of the Tidelands Oil
Production &UR;  &LR; Co., is not sure it is time to begin reopening oil
wells.
</P>
<P>
   Tidelands has 834 wells off the coast of Long Beach, Calif., but
it shut down 327 of them the last year as oil prices plunged.
</P>
<P>
   Prices had been so low for so long that Smith is reluctant to
spend the $30,000 it takes to bring a well back and rehire workers,
even though he says he makes a profit when prices are $10 a barrel.
West Texas intermediate crude oil traded at above $17 a barrel this
week for the first time in more than a year, largely on the
strength of cutbacks announced by big oil producers last month.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith's cash has been depleted, he has laid off a third of
his workers and, as with thousands of other small, independent
producers, he is worried that prices might collapse again. ``I want
to see if this thing is going to stabilize,'' he said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Independent oil companies like Tidelands account for 40 percent
of the oil produced in the United States. Many are facing the same
kinds of hard choices that Smith confronts. While they have seen
many downturns, the last year has hit them particularly hard, with
crude prices at a low of $10.35 a barrel in December. Their
problems make it unlikely that domestic production, which hit a
50-year low of about six million barrels a day last month, will
recover soon.
</P>
<P>
   Those that have suffered most and will have the hardest time
recovering are the very small producers. They typically own about
10 so-called stripper wells. Many motorists glimpse wells of this
type from the highways in states like California, Texas, Oklahoma,
and Kansas, the pumps slowly bobbing up and down, extracting about
2.2 barrels a day at each unit from old and often declining fields.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they produce very small amounts individually,
together they account for 1.3 million barrels a day. That is about
20 percent of domestic output and roughly the amount the United
States imports daily from Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   While lower crude oil prices have enabled consumers to enjoy
some of the lowest gasoline prices in decades, and cheap oil has
contributed to low inflation, those working in the domestic oil
industry have paid a heavy price for these benefits.
</P>
<P>
   About 52,000 jobs have been lost since October 1997 in oil and
natural gas production, according to the Bureau of Labor
Statistics. Many of these will not be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   There are 574,000 oil wells in the nation capable of producing
an average total of 6.4 million barrels a day, but about 136,000 of
them have been shut temporarily. Of those wells, which are capable
of producing about 550,000 barrels a day, some oil economists and
industry experts predict that up to half could be abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of production could turn out to be as high as 400,000
barrels a day. Some experts say many wells that will be restarted
are likely to produce at lower rates because of equipment and
technical problems.
</P>
<P>
   Such a large loss of output means that domestic oil production
is expected to continue to decline even if prices maintain their
current levels. Last month, imported oil made up more than 55
percent of the United States supply, one of the highest levels
ever, and increasing dependence on imported oil is likely to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It not just like turning the tap back on and we recover the
production that has been lost,'' said Scott Espenshade, the senior
economist at the Independent Petroleum Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular concern is the loss of the skills and knowledge of
experienced workers who have been laid off and moved on to other
fields. The losses range from crews that can handle the tough job
of drilling and keeping wells producing to the extensive web of
thousands of small and large companies that provide services and
equipment that enable many small producers to operate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Smith of Tidelands, for example, said most of the 65 workers he
had laid off had found other jobs in the strong California economy
and would not return to the volatile oil industry. Thus, he will
face the expense and strain of training new people. Once he decides
to bring the wells back he will have problems finding contractors
to help with the work because some have gone out of business or cut
back severely themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Many among those who have been laid off have been struggling,
especially in places where the local economy is not strong, like
the area around Great Bend, Kan., a city of about 15,500 in the
central part of the state some 90 miles northwest of Wichita.
</P>
<P>
   After spending 32 years in the oil industry, Dan Murta, who
lives in Great Bend, lost his job as vice president with
Tomkat &UR;  &LR; Ltd. a small independent oil company based in Wichita. From
a salary of $45,000 a year, he said, he was now reduced to earning
little more than minimum wage as a telemarketer.
</P>
<P>
   In past downturns, Murta recalled, he was able to fall back on
being a consultant to the industry for $200 to $300 a day. But so
many producers have shut down that even that has dried up.
</P>
<P>
   Murta recalled that the Halliburton Co., the Dallas-based
company that is one of the world's biggest providers of oilfield
services, once had seven centers in Kansas where those in the
business could get equipment and workers to maintain and drill
wells. But because of cutbacks by the company, which merged with
Dresser Industries, &UR;  &LR; the only office left is in Liberty, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   When he began working for Texaco in 1973, Murta recalled, eight
big oil companies had operations in Great Bend. ``They've all
gone,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Biggs is the general field superintendent of the Pickrell
Drilling Co. of Great Bend, which has about 300 wells in the area,
of which 50 are shut. He is worried that even if prices are high,
he may have trouble gearing up again. As wells sit idle, all kinds
of problems can develop, including water seeping into fields and
cracking in pipes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like letting a car sit around for six months,'' Biggs
said. ``You don't know what might go wrong.'' His company, however,
has the financial strength to recover because the wells that have
kept pumping have provided cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   Others are not as fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Banks Lazenby , the chairwoman of the Bretagne &UR;  &LR;  Corp.,
a 600-well independent based in Nashville, Tenn., said that while
her company was able to conserve enough cash to rebuild, many
people did not have the capital. ``It's going to be an extended
time before they can begin reinvesting,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the smaller producers might have to invest $10,000 to
$15,000 to get a well pumping again. That is a substantial sum
when, in a good year, with crude oil prices in the range of $17 to
$18 a barrel, a producer with 10 wells might net about $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be harder for the small producer to find the
capital,'' Ms. Lazenby said. ``That's why not everyone is going to
get back in.''
</P>
<P>
   She was also pessimistic about the long-term future for small
operators. ``There are few young people coming in,'' she said.
``They're just tired of fighting it.''

 &HT;    Dooley had final say in hiring Harrick
 &HT;    By Plott Brice
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Georgia athletics director Vince Dooley made the
decision on hiring Jim Harrick as Georgia's basketball coach,
according to all parties involved in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Dooley had the support of Georgia president Michael Adams. But a
flurry of media reports, relying on unidentified sources, described
a situation in which Adams made the decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could be further from the truth, Dooley and Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said he could see why some people might misconstrue his
involvement in the athletics department. For one thing, he's
interested in sports. ``And I also think that we have just had two
very high-profile situations,'' Adams said Friday. ``The possible
departure of (football) Jim Donnan (to North Carolina last year)
and the situation with the basketball coach _ both of which I hope
we don't have to deal with for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spend less than 15 percent of my time on athletics,'' Adams
said. ``And the fact is, if you are the president of the University
of Georgia, you will spend some time on athletics, because some
situations have institutional implications as well as athletic
implications.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports that Adams had been heavily involved in the search and
in the job offer seemed to be reinforced Thursday night when Adams
and senior associate athletics director Dick Bestwick met reporters
to explain Harrick's stunning reversals.
</P>
<P>
   Dooley, however, was in Virginia on a long-planned trip with his
grandson. And it had been Dooley who decided late Thursday
afternoon that Harrick would become the Georgia coach, despite the
coach's change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   It has been reported that Adams and Harrick and their wives had
a friendship when both men worked at Pepperdine University.
</P>
<P>
   By telephone from Virginia, Dooley said, ``Dr. Adams played a
significant role in that he knew Harrick the man. I only knew about
Harrick as a coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams was kept advised of developments from the beginning of the
search, shortly after Ron Jirsa was fired March 11, Dooley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He treated this like any other search,'' Dooley said.
``Certainly, as president he had a final veto, as he would with any
dean. He said he would like to interview the final two. I welcomed
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dooley declined to comment on reports that the job was offered
to another candidate before Harrick, but no one at Georgia has
denied it. Harrick made reference to it in his initial news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Dooley and Adams interviewed Harrick at the Final Four in
Florida. ``In St. Petersburg, we had interviews, and I wanted him
there,'' Dooley said. ``That was my choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrick said Friday that he saw nothing unusual about Adams
being present at the interview in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I interviewed at UCLA, and the chancellor was in the room
during the whole interview,'' Harrick said. ``I interviewed with
the president at Pepperdine. I interviewed with the president at
Rhode Island. So Im not surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrick also said that Adams said little during the interviewing
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the only involvement Mike Adams had was getting my
name on the list,'' Harrick said. ``From then on, and in the
interview, he didn't say much at all. It was mostly Coach Dooley.
And I never had a phone call from Michael Adams; I had them all
with Coach Dooley. He was the point guy on it, and, as far as I
know, he made the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrick called Adams late Thursday and said he had changed his
mind again, that he wanted the Georgia job if it was still his, the
university president said. But Adams said he told Harrick that he
would not make that decision, that Dooley would have to make it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that were not the case, I would not be athletic director,''
Dooley said Friday. ``And people who know me know that.''

 &HT;    Harrick got `emotional about family'
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ One day after his flip-flop-flip on whether to
become Georgia's men's basketball coach, Jim Harrick was able to
stand Friday before a firing line of television cameras and
newspaper reporters at Stegeman Coliseum and make light of a
situation that wasn't very funny 24 hours before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I didn't make everybody in two states mad,'' cracked
Harrick, knowing full well he had. ``I'm sure some people have
called and asked, `Do you need psychological help?'''
</P>
<P>
   But Harrick turned serious when the questions turned to why he
accepted the Georgia position amid much pomp and circumstance, only
to back out less than a day later and bolt for Rhode Island. And
why, then, come back?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got emotional about (my family), and that's all it
was,'' Harrick said. ``I went back home. But when I got off the
plane, my family was waiting for me, and I talked to all three of
my sons and they said, `(Georgia) is the best place for you. Now
get on that plane and go back.' (Georgia was) gracious enough to
let me do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just an emotional thing. If you have family, if you
have kids, you understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrick returned to Athens late Friday morning and hit the
ground running. After a brief meeting with the coaching staff that
has been in place, Harrick spent much of the day on the telephone.
He said he called the Bulldogs' five signees for next season,
called four or five recruits and spoke to Jumaine Jones'
high-school
</P>
<P>
   coach, Rufus McDuffie.
</P>
<P>
   After a 25-minute news conference early in the afternoon,
Harrick was whisked to the airport by Georgia assistant coach
Michael Hunt. Harrick said he was bound for Michigan where he was
to attend the Magic Johnson High School All-Star Game Friday night.
He will return for the Naismith Awards banquet tonight in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Harrick conceded that, even without his moment of indecision,
rebuilding Georgia's basketball program is going to be a monumental
task. From this season's 15-15 team, the Bulldogs lose five
seniors, and possibly sophomore Jones to the NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a big job to do,'' he said. ``You always hope you
can do it in one year, but I don't know if we can do it that fast.
There's some freshmen point guards that are going to have to play,
and that's always tough in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrick bristled when asked if his actions might have crippled
recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing this a long time, and I can handle whatever
recruiting is required,'' Harrick said. ``I recruited at UCLA for
eight years and Pepperdine for nine and Rhode Island for two, so
I'm well equipped for things like that. Anybody that wants to use
this negatively, that's fine. But we don't ever talk about other
schools or other coaches. It's always seemed to work out for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrick also has a recruiting job to do among the Bulldogs'
returning players. After initially embracing Harrick's hiring, some
players seemed more wary on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disgusted,'' freshman D.A. Layne said of hearing the
news Harrick was returning to Rhode Island. ``I couldn't believe
it. My first reaction was hurt and disappointment. I'm confused,
but you just have to move on and think about it in a positive way.
I'm glad he's back now.''
</P>
<P>
   However, center Robb Dryden said, ``I don't think there will be
any doubts in any of the players' minds. We pretty much understand
what he was going through from his standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrick said he thinks everyone will get over his inauspicious
start as soon as the season starts and the Bulldogs start out to
win games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first dunk we get,'' he said, ``people will come.''

LILA LUCE TYNG, 100, FIRST WIFE OF HENRY R. LUCE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Conn., Ill., Colo., S.C.)   By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lila Hotz Luce Tyng, the first wife of Henry R. Luce,
founder of Time Inc., died on Wednesday at her home in Gladstone,
N.J., five days after her 100th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tyng, the mother of Luce's children, was a leading figure
in New York's social and philanthropic circles for several decades.
</P>
<P>
   Though overshadowed in history by the editor's famous second
wife, the author Clare Boothe Luce, Mrs. Tyng played an important
role in the life of Luce, who sought her advice even after they
were divorced, said Robert E. Herzstein, a professor of history at
the University of South Carolina and the author of ``Henry R.
Luce'' (Scribner, 1994).
</P>
<P>
   Lila Hotz was born in Chicago in 1899, the daughter of Robert
Schuttler Hotz, an inventor and financier, and Lila Ross Hotz. On
New Year's Eve 1919, she met the young Luce through one of his Yale
classmates, Thornton Wilder; they were married in 1923.
</P>
<P>
   The young wife hoped that Time's growing success would
eventually allow her workaholic husband to join her in the kind of
social whirl she loved. But they divorced in 1935, not long after
Luce met Clare Boothe, whose literary and journalistic drives and
interests better matched his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lila was devastated when Luce confronted her with his
intention to divorce her,'' Herzstein said. ``But they maintained a
closeness and were in constant contact, often discussing their
children's education and careers, among other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tyng and Luce, who died in 1967, had two sons: Henry Luce
III, chairman and chief executive of the Henry Luce Foundation in
New York City, and Peter Paul Luce of Englewood, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, she married Sewell Tappan Tyng, a lawyer, author, head
of a mining company and assistant to the New York City district
attorney, Thomas E. Dewey. She became a fixture in New York
society, serving on the boards of several institutions, including
the Henry Street Settlement, the Berkshire Farm School, the
Spence-Chapin Adoption Service and the Grosvenor Neighborhood
House. She once reported attending 36 balls in 36 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Besides her two sons, Mrs. Tyng is survived by six grandchildren
and five great-grandchildren.

   JOBLESS RATE FALLS TO 4.2 PERCENT, ITS LOWEST LEVEL IN 29 YEARS
</P>
<P>
   The nation's jobless rate dropped to 4.2 percent in March, its
lowest level in 29 years, in the latest of many signs that the
nation's labor market remains remarkably robust.
</P>
<P>
   But in a break from the feverish hiring of the last three years,
American companies added far fewer new workers to their payrolls
last month than had been typical lately.

   AN ARREST IN THE MELISSA VIRUS CASE
</P>

   MEXICAN PRIVATIZATION PLAN OPPOSED
</P>
<P>
   At a recent hearing on President Ernesto Zedillo's proposal to
privatize Mexico's electric power industry, government workers who
oppose the plan broke out singing Mexico's national anthem. The
patriotic incident underlined the struggle that Zedillo faces in
raising support for the privatization plan, which he says is
urgently needed to attract $25 billion in investments to modernize
and expand the country's power generation and distribution.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA IS INVESTING IN PUBLIC WORKS

<P>
   Beijing spent nearly $200 billion on public construction
projects last year, and plans to do the same this year.

<P>
   NISSAN MAY END LIGHT-TRUCK VENTURE
</P>
<P>
   Nissan Motors, Japan's second-largest automaker, said that it
might end its light-truck venture with DaimlerChrysler. Renault
bought a 37 percent stake in Nissan after DaimlerChrysler abandoned
plans to acquire a stake in Nissan.
</P>
<P>
   PUNITIVE TARIFFS MAY BE CONSIDERED
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. International Trade Commission found that a surge in
imports of low-priced carbon steel plate from Japan, South Korea
and four other countries may have injured American steelmakers
enough to warrant consideration of punitive tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   STOCK PRICES WERE MIXED IN JAPAN
</P>
<P>
   Japanese stock prices closed mixed, with the shares of
export-dependent companies benefiting from the dollar's gains
against the yen. The Nikkei average of 225 stocks fell 37.37
points, to 16,290.19.

   A DEADLINE FOR CREDIT LYONNAIS BIDS

VERA TOLSTOY, GRANDDAUGHTER OF THE NOVELIST, DIES AT 96  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Washington, Czechoslovakia, France, Russia, Sweden)   By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vera Tolstoy, a Russian refugee who became a teen-age bride in
Czechoslovakia, worked as a hairdresser in Prague, sang Gypsy songs
in Paris, sold perfume in New York and spent 25 years with the
Voice of America in Washington, died on Monday at her retirement
home in New Smyrna Beach, Fla. She was 96 and the last living link
to her grandfather Leo Tolstoy.
</P>
<P>
   To the world of the early 1900s, Leo Tolstoy was a literary
giant who had become the ``hermit of Yasnaya Polyana,'' the
luxurious family estate 150 miles south of Moscow where he lived
for 48 years and wrote ``Anna Karenina'' and ``War and Peace.''
</P>
<P>
   To his granddaughter, who grew up on a nearby estate with her
mother, Sophia, and father, Ilya, the author's second son, he was
simply her beloved bushy-faced dedushka, the jolly man in a peasant
shirt who bounced her on his knee and tickled her cheek with his
whiskers.
</P>
<P>
   A small, lively woman who could affect a magisterial air, Miss
Tolstoy dropped her hereditary title, countess, after she came to
the United States in 1949, but as an aristocratic exercise of
noblesse oblige saw no reason to correct friends who continued to
address her that way.
</P>
<P>
   Although she sometimes found the name Tolstoy a burden, and even
called herself Vera Mansoureva (after her mother's family estate)
during her years as a Russian-language broadcaster, she was proud
enough of her family connections to regale friends with tales of
the old days at Yasnaya Polyana and to give lectures on her family
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   As a second-generation descendant of a man who had 13 children
(and now has some 200 living descendants) Miss Tolstoy, the
youngest of seven surviving siblings, liked to call herself
Tolstoy's last granddaughter and never mind that a cousin from the
Swedish branch of the family might still be alive.
</P>
<P>
   As she made clear to relatives, the Swedish branch, descended
from Tolstoy's son Leo didn't count since they didn't speak
Russian.
</P>
<P>
   For Miss Tolstoy, who was 7 when her grandfather died in 1910
and 10 when the outbreak of World War I gave her father an excuse
to desert his family (he eventually settled in the United States
and remarried), the aristocratic life was short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   After the Russian Revolution she and her mother made a harrowing
escape, eventually landing in Czechoslovakia, where Miss Tolstoy
got a job as translator for a wealthy lumber merchant, Odo
Bakovsky, and then married him in an Islamic ceremony, giving birth
to a son, Serge, in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, after her husband had lost his money and, she
said, become unfaithful and quarrelsome, she sought to have the
marriage declared illegal, explaining that she would rather have an
annulment than a divorce because as a prospective single mother she
preferred to have an illegitimate Tolstoy than a legitimate
Bakovsky.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Tolstoy, whose son had been kidnapped by his father then
rekidnapped by her, had to settle for a divorce, but her son, her
only immediate survivor, who now lives in Washington, is known as
Serge Tolstoy.
</P>
<P>
   After supporting her mother and son by working as a hairdresser
in Prague, Miss Tolstoy moved to Paris after her mother's death in
the 1930s and worked as a nightclub singer.
</P>
<P>
   It was her aunt Alexandra Tolstoy, founder of the Tolstoy
Foundation in Valley Cottage, N.Y., who sponsored her immigration
to the United States in 1949. After a brief stay at the
foundation's farm and a stint selling perfume for Elizabeth Arden
in New York, she moved to Washington in 1954 and Florida in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 she went back to Russia for a family reunion that drew
dozens of Tolstoys, including many who had remained in the Soviet
Union, to Yasnaya Polyana, a museum that is virtually a shrine.
</P>
<P>
   Finding the house much as she remembered it, including the
formal dining room table with its elegant china and fine silver
covered by a glass dome and her grandfather's signature wide-brim
hat and peasant shirt hanging next to his washstand, Miss Tolstoy
was in her element, spotting a photograph taken with her
grandfather when she was 3, but not finding every detail to her
liking.
</P>
<P>
   When she saw an alabaster monument to Lenin, a distinct
incongruity in a museum devoted to a member of the Russian
nobility, Miss Tolstoy responded first by using an American
barnyard epithet, then reverted to aristocratic type.
</P>
<P>
   ``That statue,'' she said, poking her walking stick at the
offensive item, and using her most imperious voice, ``should be
taken away.''

LUCIEN AIGNER, PIONEER NEWS PHOTOGRAPHER, DIES AT 97  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Calif., Conn., Hungary, France)   By MARGARETT LOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lucien Aigner, a pioneer in candid news photography in the 1930s
whose best-known photographs include one of a rumpled Albert
Einstein in front of a blackboard, died on Monday in a nursing home
in Waltham, Mass. He was 97.
</P>
<P>
   In the '30s, photographers like Aigner, Erich Salomon, Alfred
Eisenstaedt and Robert Capa used the unobtrusive 35mm Leica to take
off-the-cuff pictures that were revolutionary at the time and that
hold a owerful immediacy more than half a century later. A reporter
and photojournalist for Az Est, a Budapest newspaper, Aigner left
for Paris in 1925.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 10 years he established a name for himself as an
enterprising photojournalist whose pictures appeared in
publications in Paris and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the small Leica, Aigner had the advantage of his height
(an unobtrusive five feet), enabling him to photograph where others
might have been too noticeable. He took striking pictures of
smoke-filled strategy sessions during the 1931 French presidential
election, for example, and caught Mussolini pinching his nose
during an international conference in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   A selection of his photographs was reproduced in a 1979 book,
``Lucien Aigner,'' published by the International Center for
Photography in New York as part of its Library of Photographers
series.
</P>
<P>
   A 1934 picture of ballet practice at the Paris Grand Opera will
probably remind the viewer of a Degas painting. But while the four
dancers strike beautifully casual poses, the expressions on their
faces vary from doubt to glee to faraway dreaming.
</P>
<P>
   Among Aigner's photographs of world leaders, his picture of
Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia at the train station in Geneva
in 1935 is probably the most haunting. Selassie was to appear
before a League of Nations session to ask for help as his country
was being overrun by Mussolini's troops, and his face seems to bear
witness to all the sorrows of his country.
</P>
<P>
   Aigner's portraits are among his best images. There is a
delightfully unexpected profile of the pianist Paderewski, taken in
New York in 1941. He is sitting on a low chair reading a newspaper,
his figure in shadow, the sun shining on the back of his newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Aigner was born in Hungary, on Sept. 14, 1901. While working as
reporter for a Budapest newspaper, he was assigned to escort James
Abbe, an American photographer, on a photographic assignment. Abbe
offered his young tour guide a job in his Paris office. The job
didn't last but Aigner stayed on. In 1939 he moved to the United
States, where his work soon began appearing in such publications as
The New York Times, The Christian Science Monitor, Look, Coronet
and Pageant.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1940s, he became an announcer and eventually a
producer and director at the Voice of America. In the early '50s,
during the McCarthy era, he was forced to leave his job, and for
the next 20 years or so operated a portrait studio in Great
Barrington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, Aigner gave up his portrait studio to concentrate on
cataloguing and indexing his 100,000 or so negatives. Half of them,
mostly taken in the '30s, were accidentally rediscovered in 1970
when he opened an old suitcase that his brother, the designer
Etienne Aigner, had taken from Paris during World War II. The
suitcase, abandoned in a Paris apartment that was taken over by the
Germans during their occupation of France, was rescued by the
concierge.
</P>
<P>
   Aigner is survived by four children, John Peter of Brooklyn,
Steven Andrew of Trumbull, Conn., Anne-Marie of Belmont, Mass., and
Katherine Veronice Collins of San Francisco; his brother of New
York, Paris and Cannes; a sister, Elizabeth Zentall of Laguna
Hills, Calif.; 10 grandchildren; and 3 great-grandchildren.

   FISHER ISLAND, Fla. _ When he sold Hebrew National, the family
cold-cuts business, for more than $100 million six years ago,
Isadore Pines did not imagine that he would spend his retirement
stirring up his neighbors on this idyllic redoubt a short ferry
ride south of Miami Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Pines _ whose friends call him Skippy _ seems a most unlikely
rebel. He owns a $4.5 million apartment that overlooks the ocean,
and he has rickety legs that undermine his tennis game. But like
dozens of others here, he believes that plans by the developers who
recently bought much of Fisher Island to build 315 lavish
condominiums amid the royal palms and banyan trees can only
diminish the current residents' quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   And so Pines has become a captain in a war between the haves and
the haves that has raged for two years across this 216-acre island,
which Oprah Winfrey, Mel Brooks, retired corporate moguls and
various South American jet-setters call home _ at least during the
high season.
</P>
<P>
   An incident last month illustrates just how tense, and sometimes
comic, the conflict has become.
</P>
<P>
   According to Pines, he was nearly mowed down at dusk on March 11
by a golf cart driven by one of the island's developers. Pines
acknowledges that he was distributing fliers despite a warning from
security guards, but he contends that the developer, Daniel McLean,
veered away to avoid hitting him only at the last possible moment.
</P>
<P>
   Although McLean said that the near sideswipe was unintentional
and that he simply did not see Pines ``in the dark,'' Pines called
the police, his lawyer and his publicist.
</P>
<P>
   And a passer-by, seeing Pines talking with a Miami police
officer, used a cell phone to alert fellow rebels at a nearby
cocktail party. Twenty men jumped into their own golf carts and
converged on the scene. No riot ensued, but the incident moved
quickly from the gossip pages of the local newspapers into the lore
of the island.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute on Fisher Island, which has spawned at least a dozen
lawsuits, is not unlike those that touch off the kind of Florida
condominium wars caricatured in ``Seinfeld'' episodes _ or
Manhattan development battles like the current effort by
well-heeled East Side residents to stop Donald Trump from building
a residential tower near the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to think of a turf war involving as many captains
of industry, millionaire entrepreneurs and celebrities as the one
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fisher Island is a beautiful, glamorous development that's
captured a lot of people's attention,'' said Lewis Goodkin, a
longtime Miami real estate consultant. ``There's nothing more
difficult than a developer going into a community populated largely
by wealthy people, all of whom have influence that could work
against you.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher Island, which advertisements depict as ``unrivaled in
luxury, seclusion and grace,'' sits in the aquamarine waters of
Biscayne Bay, accessible only by private ferries that make the
seven-minute run from Miami Beach every quarter-hour. Security
guards check each visitor, insuring privacy. A narrow tree- and
shrub-lined road circles the island. In the center is a nine-hole
golf course; strung along the perimeter are red-roofed
condominiums, an exquisite clubhouse, a marina, six restaurants and
17 tennis courts.
</P>
<P>
   McLean, a major Chicago developer, and his partner John Melk, a
Chicago financier, bought their chunk of the island for about $50
million last July after a lengthy, fractious and unsuccessful
attempt by the residents to buy it themselves. The two men acquired
33 unsold apartments, boat slips, unsold memberships in the Fisher
Island Club and 40 acres of land, with the right to add 637 new
units of housing to the island's existing 563.
</P>
<P>
   Melk, a bearish, gray-haired man, bought his own
5,800-square-foot apartment on the island in 1990, for $2.3
million. He said he was surprised by the opposition to last year's
development deal, especially since he planned to reduce the total
number of club memberships and build only 315 new units, just half
the number for which he had permits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd be the white knight,'' said Melk, who together
with his friend H. Wayne Huizenga made a fortune from investments
in Waste Management Inc. and the Blockbuster video chain. ``We're
downsizing, so there should be cheers and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pines and others, including Murray Norkin, a retired
residential builder from New York, say that the new units, though
fewer than had been planned, would be larger, and that the total
amount of residential space on the island would jump by 70 percent.
That, they say, would overwhelm the island's services, causing long
lines at the restaurants and unconscionable delays at the ferry and
the golf club.
</P>
<P>
   The battle, fought largely among fewer than half the island's
residents _ those who spend more than several weeks a year here _
has grown mean-spirited. ``They're not held back by honesty or
ethics,'' Melk said of his opponents, who return the compliment in
their characterizations of him.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On a recent weekday, there was ample parking available and
little competition for tables at the island's six restaurants,
although everyone agrees the island is more crowded on the weekends
and virtually empty during the summer. Aside from tennis pro Pete
Sampras, who was warming up on Court 6 for the Lipton Championships
on Key Biscayne, the tennis courts were empty. There was a traffic
jam at the ferry, though, when activists on both sides of the
dispute headed to Miami for a public hearing on the development
project.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels concede that they bought their property on the island
knowing that plans called for the total number of apartments here
to reach as many as 1,200, although they now find that
unacceptable. Pines favors banning more growth altogether, but many
other residents say they would accept an additional 100 or even 200
apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Melk is not selling _ and we did not buy _ traffic fumes and
overcrowding,'' said Gerri LeBow, who has opposed the developers'
efforts along with her husband, maverick financier Bennett LeBow,
best known for his Brooke Group's break with other tobacco
companies when it turned over documents in the states' historic
anti-smoking lawsuits. The LeBows live year-round on the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bought privacy, beauty, and most of all, safety, which will
disappear with 315 more condominiums,'' Mrs. LeBow said. ``The
island has one road only to serve residents, visitors and staff of
all kinds, not to mention hotel guests and their guests.''
</P>
<P>
   Each side contends that it represents the majority view, and
each says that property values will plummet if the other prevails.
</P>
<P>
   `` Melk stands to make more than $100 million,'' Pines said.
``He expects us to watch the value of our apartments go down, our
expenses go up and our beautiful island be paved over with
concrete.''
</P>
<P>
   Monette Klein-O'Grady, a longtime resident who had been involved
in residents' negotiations to buy the island, now supports Melk.
She said that Pines, whom she labels an ``extremist,'' and the
others opposing the developers are part of a cabal that has
intimidated residents in a ``radical'' attempt to take control of
the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have not come to terms with not owning the island,'' said
Ms. Klein-O'Grady, a real estate consultant, as she and the
developers' publicist sat on her apartment veranda, just 15 yards
from the ocean. ``They're making life miserable for the majority of
people on the island. Today we have a respected developer who has a
passion for the island. I believe we as a group should move
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The competing factions have showered residents with enough
leaflets, position papers and open letters to constitute the
island's first snowfall. Sadly, some one-time friends no longer
talk to one another. And some people are unable to find golf or
tennis partners.
</P>
<P>
   In what many residents viewed as a referendum on the development
issue, David Bianchi, a Miami lawyer backed by the rebels, recently
won election as a director of the Fisher Island Club, which
oversees the golf club, restaurants and recreational facilities. He
received about 60 percent of the vote, defeating Ira Kaufman, the
former chairman of the Exchange National Bank in Chicago, who
supports the developers. The rebels also gathered more than 200
signatures on a petition demanding a moratorium on development and
submitted it to the Miami-Dade County Commission.
</P>
<P>
   It was a hearing on the petition in Miami, on March 18, that
caused the traffic jam on the way to the ferry. In the hearing
room, the bitterness of the division was apparent. Knots of
residents turned their backs on one another.
</P>
<P>
   One side contended that a physician living on the island had
strong-armed a patient into signing a petition; the other countered
that a resident had switched sides because the developer promised
him a piece of the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's heartbreaking,'' said a visibly dismayed Sharon Gless,
who played Cagney in the television crime drama ``Cagney and
Lacey'' and is neutral in the development dispute. ``Friendships
have been severed, it seems like for life. All the affection people
had seems to be gone now.''
</P>
<P>
   The rhetorical salvos continued during the six-hour hearing.
``This is a block war, a unit-by-unit war by some people who don't
want to wait 15 minutes for a ferryboat,'' testified Clifford
Shulman, a lawyer for the developers. ``They've had this little
island paradise to themselves, and they want to keep it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The 13-member commission rejected the moratorium. Pines said he
had not expected to win, though he took solace in the commission's
decision to conduct a traffic study and to examine whether island
development had violated covenants with Miami. The rebels vowed to
keep fighting.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes that the residents, with 450 employees to
maintain the amenities they share, lead a pampered existence. But
many residents feel that they have paid for the pampering. The
average cost of their apartments was about $1.8 million, and it
costs an additional $80,000 to join the island club. The owner of a
large apartment can also expect to pay about $130,000 a year in
club dues, taxes and condominium and community fees.
</P>
<P>
   Bianchi, like Melk and residents on the other side of the
barricade, becomes almost poetic in describing life on the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the crown jewel of real estate, surrounded by turquoise
water, a stone's throw from South Beach, 15 minutes from an
international airport,'' he said. ``You can get up early, walk past
the royal palms when no one's around and see the macaws flying in
the trees. You're in paradise.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Created in 1905 when the federal government sliced off the
southern tip of Miami Beach to make a shipping channel from Miami
to the Atlantic Ocean, Fisher Island has long been both a bauble
for the rich and a financial black hole for anyone who struggled to
develop its sandy, sun-drenched surface.
</P>
<P>
   The island got its name from Carl Fisher, the flamboyant
entrepreneur who converted an alligator-infested mangrove swamp
into Miami Beach. He bought the island in 1919 from Dana Dorsey, a
prominent black businessman in Miami who had given up on an effort
to build a resort for blacks who were barred from Miami's beaches.
Fisher spent nearly $5 million developing plans for a seaport and
squabbling with the City of Miami before he swapped the island in
1927 for a 250-foot yacht owned by William K. Vanderbilt II, the
railroad heir.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt built an estate on the island with marble fireplaces,
oak and mahogany paneling, servants' quarters, swimming pools and a
nine-hole golf course.
</P>
<P>
   After he died in 1944, Fisher Island passed through the hands of
several other millionaires before a development group that included
Charles (Bebe) Rebozo and his friend Richard M. Nixon bought it in
1963. The group wanted to build 5,000 apartments and a 1,200-room
hotel but got bogged down in a zoning battle with the city, which
wanted the island for a public park.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Co., based in Newark,
N.J., bought the island and formed a partnership with William
Rebozo, Charles' nephew, to develop a more modest 1,200
condominiums for the upper middle class. Expenses mounted while
nothing was built, and Mutual Benefit ousted Rebozo in 1985 and
redesigned the plans for a wealthier market. By 1993, two years
after Mutual Benefit had fallen into receivership, the insurance
company had poured $317 million into building apartments, a health
spa, tennis courts, restaurants and a new golf course.
</P>
<P>
   Despite rave reviews for the development, 225 of 563
condominiums remained unsold. It would take another six years to
sell them.
</P>
<P>
   The current battle for Fisher Island began in 1997, when Mutual
Benefit announced that it would sell the development as a prelude
to the sale of the insurance company itself, which was completed
early this year. Various groups on the island formed a negotiating
team to buy the island for the residents, but just as a $10 million
deal was taking shape in December 1997, the unity of the residents
exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Klein-O'Grady, who had appointed some members of the
negotiating team, sent a letter to the chairman of the insurance
company, Alan Bowers, stating that his representatives were meeting
with ``a narrow group of residents'' and urging him to meet instead
with a ``responsible developer.'' Many of the activists on both
sides blame her for the failure of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Klein-O'Grady said she disagreed with the terms, fearing
that they would drive up the average resident's costs by $30,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits flew between the residents and the insurance company
and among residents themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual Benefit, which was suffering $6 million to $10 million a
year in operating losses, then turned to Boca Developers, a
residential developer in Florida. But Boca, too, failed to conclude
a deal, and it filed yet another lawsuit, this one contending that
14 island residents had scared off lenders.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Pines, who had not yet been involved in the
disputes, joined with others in another unsuccessful effort to buy
the island for the residents. The group included Richard Voell, the
former president of the Rockefeller Group, a private real estate,
entertainment and telecommunications company, and David Paresky,
who had sold his company, Thomas Cook Travel, to American Express
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Melk said, he and McLean received a call from a
real estate broker asking them to consider bidding for Fisher
Island. In a matter of weeks, the developers signed a deal with the
desperate insurance company. However, Melk, like the residents'
team and Boca Developers, had been bound by a confidentiality
agreement that prevented him from talking about the deal during
negotiations, a condition that bred distrust among residents.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there was any common ground with the developer, Ms.
LeBow gave an answer born of the boardroom. ``All of life is a
negotiation,'' she said, suggesting that there was room to talk
about the number of new apartments that the rebels could accept.
``It's time to sit around the negotiating table.''
</P>
<P>
   McLean, however, does not sound like someone ready to make
peace. ``They can harass us to death,'' he said, ``but there's no
way they can prevent us from building.''
</P>
<P>
   The developer may not have taken the full measure of Pines. He
spent decades, he said, worrying about someone finding a piece of
glass in one of his Hebrew National kosher hot dogs; after all, his
company described itself as answering ``to a higher authority.''
But after selling the company to Conagra in 1993, he looked forward
to a stress-free life.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he has become a man with a mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so not my life style,'' Pines said, sounding a bit
sheepish as he explained the tactics of his protest, including his
new habit of parking his Lexus, with a rear-window sign emblazoned
``Stop the Destruction of Fisher Island,'' in front of the island's
sales office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a loner,'' he said. ``But I've spoken to more people in
the last year than in my lifetime. I'm at a stage in life where I
don't want to be taken advantage of.''

 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After nine days of hesitation, NATO attacked the
center of Yugoslavia's capital, destroying the command centers of
the security forces carrying out President Slobodan Milosevic's
offensive against the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A barrage of seven cruise missiles _ fired from American
warships and a British submarine in the Adriatic _ struck just
before 1 a.m. Saturday in Belgrade, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon refused Friday night to disclose the targets hit,
but flames raged from two buildings near the Sava River in
Belgrade's core, the federal Ministry for Internal Affairs and the
Ministry of the Interior. The buildings house the headquarters of
the paramilitary police forces that have carried out Milosevic's
yearlong crackdown against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in 10 days of attacks that NATO had struck
the center of Belgrade, a once-thriving capital that has slowly
withered under years of economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation
caused by Milosevic's policies.
</P>
<P>
   Although previous attacks battered military targets on
Belgrade's edges, the missiles Friday night struck with a
thunderous clap that shook the entire capital. Within minutes of
the first explosion, an enormous arc of flames soared hundreds of
feet into the air.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of casualties from the strikes was not immediately
clear, but the attack occurred in the middle of the night, at a
time when the buildings would presumably have few people in them.
</P>
<P>
   The two buildings are close to other government buildings,
including a hospital. But it appeared that the cruise missiles _
each with a 1,000-pound warhead _ struck their targets with
pinpoint precision, leaving other buildings nearby still standing.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Yugoslavia's deputy prime minister, Vuk Draskovic,
said there were ``many, many victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Militarily and psychologically, the strikes were the first firm
evidence that NATO was carrying out the warning by its commander,
Gen. Wesley Clark, that there would be ``no sanctuary'' for
Yugoslavia's political and military leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week NATO gave Clark the authority to expand the
raids beyond strictly military targets in or near Kosovo. On
Thursday American F-15s destroyed a bridge over the Danube River in
the city of Novi Sad, and Pentagon and NATO officials have vowed
that more bridges and other targets in cities would be pounded as
long as Milosevic continued his repression in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's strikes came after nine days of bombing had made
little progress in slowing Milosevic's onslaught against ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo. Refugees continued to pour from Kosovo into
Albania and Macedonia, telling of killings and forced expulsions
from villages, towns and cities throughout the province.
</P>
<P>
   The mushrooming refugee crisis along Kosovo's border _ where
hundreds of thousands of refugees have gathered, short of food and
shelter _ has put new pressure on the United States and NATO to
intensify its campaign, even if that meant considering the use of
ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, facing sharp questions at a White House news
briefing, appealed for patience and expressed confidence that an
air campaign alone would be able to achieve NATO's military and
political objectives in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be determined,'' Clinton said. ``We must be
persistent. We must be patient if we expect to see this mission
through. And I am absolutely determined to do that. We have to make
sure that Milosevic pays a heavy price for this policy of
repression. We have to seriously diminish his capacity to maintain
that policy.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The NATO air campaign has been severely hampered by the Balkan
weather, with rain, low clouds and fog forcing many warplanes to
abandon their targets. Through the first nine nights, alliance
aircraft flew some 2,700 missions over or near Yugoslavia, 405 of
them combat strikes. The Pentagon estimated that 20 percent of the
missions had been scrubbed because of foul weather, but other
officials have said the number was much higher.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, a number of NATO warplanes _ including F-16s and
F-15s _ took advantage of a brief break in the rainy weather to
launch the first daylight air raids against Yugoslav forces. The
jets attacked ground forces operating near the center of Kosovo,
NATO and Pentagon officials said, declining to identify what was
struck.
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, however, clouds and rain once again blanketed the
region, forcing frustrated NATO commanders to limit their attacks
to weapons unaffected by weather, including the Tomahawk cruise
missiles that struck Belgrade Friday night. Forecasts predict that
the weather will clear over the weekend, and when it does,
officials at NATO and the Pentagon said, the raids will increase in
scope and intensity.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO's headquarters in Brussels, officials said the brunt of
the raids occurring now are falling on ground forces directly
involved in the campaign against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. A
military spokesman, Air Commodore David Wilby of Britain, described
a series of strikes against military targets on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   One strike hit what he described as a support base for
Yugoslavia's 243rd Mechanized Brigade, which is now operating in
the Pagarusa Valley, where thousands of Albanians have reportedly
been surrounded by Yugoslav forces and repeatedly shelled. The
Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said American B-1 bombers,
joining the attacks for the first time, had also bombed a staging
area for armored forces in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those attacks, the Yugoslav forces have continued to
press their offensive in the Pagarusa Valley and near Malisevo, a
city west of Kosovo's capital, Pristina, that is the last
stronghold of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence reports collected here in Washington suggest that
Milosevic's forces have largely routed the rebels of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, but Wilby said Friday that the rebels remained a
viable force.
</P>
<P>
   He and other officials also reported that the Yugoslav forces
were being slowed, if not stopped, by the cumulative effects of
NATO's raids, particularly the destruction of fuel and ammunition
depots. Wilby said one Yugoslav unit, the 549th motorized brigade,
had been ``immobilized'' near Djakovica while waiting for more
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   He said that ``therefore, NATO air-to-ground operations against
fielded forces in Kosovo are already degrading and disrupting'' the
Yugoslav military's ability to use tanks.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, Bacon said the attacks were taking a toll on
Yugoslav morale, too, though he offered little evidence to back
that up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly are having some impact on command and control,'' he
said. ``We're seeing some morale problems in the army. The forces
are clearly more wary of being hit. They've had to disperse more
and are having a harder time operating in large, coherent units.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also acknowledged the limits of the success. ``We have
not seen tanks stopped in their tracks, if that's what you mean,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite signs of some progress, officials have pressed for new
weapons that would allow NATO to intensify the attacks on the
ground forces. Clark has asked Secretary of Defense William Cohen
to approve the use of Apache helicopter gunships _ used to attack
tanks _ and long-range rocket batteries to support them.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said Cohen had not yet made a decision on the request. The
helicopters would require large numbers of Army troops to move into
the region _ 300 soldiers for a battalion of 18 helicopters _ and
that has raised fears that it would amount to an introduction of
American ground forces into the Balkans. The Clinton administration
has repeatedly ruled that out.
</P>
<P>
   The sensitivity of bombing Belgrade was so great that Clinton
himself approved the target list earlier this week and authorized
the attack itself within the last 24 hours, an aide said. Because
of the possibility of substantial civilian loss of life, aides had
sought Clinton's specific approval for the attack on the two
ministry buildings Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The targets of this phase of NATO's campaign _ first the bridge,
then the two ministry buildings _ are being deliberately chosen and
timed to maximize their psychological impact and to leave the
Yugoslav authorities uncertain of when and where the next strike
will be, a senior administration official said. The official said
other buildings _ like the Ministry of Defense _ are among the
targets.

INTRIGUING SUBPLOTS HIGHLIGHT SANTA ANITA DERBY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ The West's Kentucky Derby candidates meet
today in a race so contentious, top-ranked U.S. 3-year-old Prime
Timber is rated the third choice on the Santa Anita morning line.
</P>
<P>
   That's the plot for the 62nd Santa Anita Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the subplots that make this one of the more
intriguing editions of the $750,000 race _ the personalities, the
dirty dealing and the matter of sex (gender, anyway).
</P>
<P>
   _Honest Lady tries to be the fifth filly _ the first since
Winning Colors in 1988 _ to win the Santa Anita Derby. She's one of
four fillies around the country to be considered Kentucky Derby
prospects this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fillies are a cut above the usual,'' trainer Bobby
Frankel said. ``I think she can run with these (colts).''
</P>
<P>
   Frankel said Honest Lady and jockey Kent Desormeaux will have to
win ``or have a big excuse'' to go on to the Kentucky Derby. She
fought for the lead and finished a close fifth in the San Rafael
Stakes behind Desert Hero, Prime Timber and Capsized, all in
today's 1[-mile race.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel, a Hall of Famer for his success with older horses, has
run only two horses in Kentucky Derbies. He admitted a case of
Derby Fever is the reason he ``might be pushing'' Honest Lady.
</P>
<P>
   _Desert Hero tries to stay unbeaten in his first start for
trainer Richard Mandella, who took over when Saudi Prince Ahmed bin
Salman's Thoroughbred Corp. abruptly fired Wally Dollase in
mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday, Mandella hadn't even seen videotape of his new
horse in action, though he liked what he'd read about Desert Hero's
resourceful victory in the San Rafael.
</P>
<P>
   Desert Hero is 2 for 2 in his brief career. Twelve horses have
taken undefeated records into the Santa Anita Derby and six have
won _ including Indian Charlie last year.
</P>
<P>
   As for Dollase, he's out of business at least temporarily and
the object of sympathy on the Santa Anita backstretch. Dollase is
declining public comment on his firing while haggling continues
over his Thoroughbred Corp. contract.
</P>
<P>
   Desert Hero is ridden by Corey Nakatani _ Dollase's son-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   _Chris McCarron has a little extra incentive when he rides
likely pacesetter High Wire Act after being bounced from General
Challenge by trainer Bob Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Stevens, Baffert's No.1 rider, replaces McCarron, who would
have taken his breach-of-contract complaint to the state stewards
if the trainer hadn't promised him attractive future mounts.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy resulted in a public argument Tuesday between
Baffert and McCarron agent Scotty McClellan, during which the
normally affable Baffert shoved the typically low-key McClellan in
the back.
</P>
<P>
   All parties say the dispute is behind them _ but it'll be the
story if High Wire Act pulls an upset. The gelding's wire-to-wire
allowance victory in February earned a 106 Beyer speed figure to
match Prime Timber for the career- high in this field.
</P>
<P>
   _The trainers span a range of personalities from proud D. Wayne
Lukas, the soon-to-be Hall of Famer who has a Santa Anita Derby
entrant for the 21st straight year in Charismatic, to unassuming
Lisa Lewis, the 29-year-old California newcomer who has built a
good reputation since opening a stable in Minnesota nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had only three 2-year-olds last year,'' said Lewis, whose
Capsized can improve. ``You compare that to a guy like Baffert, and
it's pretty amazing to think we've got a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert is the race's largest personality. He hopes to shoot for
a record third-straight Kentucky Derby victory May 1 after winning
with Silver Charm and Real Quiet _ each a Santa Anita Derby
runner-up.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert's General Challenge is 3-1 and Prime Timber is 7-2, both
behind 5-2 Desert Hero on the track's morning line, which raised
eyebrows when it was announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't worry about stuff like that (the odds). But I
thought Prime Timber would be favored off his last race,'' Baffert
said, referring to the colt's victory over since-injured barnmate
Exploit in the San Felipe Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Timber's owner Aaron Jones said a representative of
Dubai's Sheikh Mohammed offered $6 million for the colt on Thursday
but ``I'm not about to sell him, not even for $20 million.''
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge has recorded fast workouts since being fitted
with blinkers following a fifth-place finish in the Louisiana
Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the blinkers will help him focus,'' Baffert said.
</P>
<P>
   So many distracting side issues surround today's race, maybe the
rest of us should wear blinkers too.

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, April 3:
</P>
<P>
   In the years since Mario Puzo and Marlon Brando lifted their
imaginary mafia to the realm of myth, the gene pool of the real
five families has gotten pretty shallow. John J. Gotti proved that
making wise-guy talk as if federal wiretaps did not exist is really
not the smartest thing for a don to do.
</P>
<P>
   Now it looks like his son and accused heir, 35-year-old John A.
Gotti, is having trouble making ends meet despite the booming
economy. He has, in fact, done something that his alleged
predecessors in La Cosa Nostra would have found unthinkable. Gotti
the younger said to a federal judge, put me in jail, please.
Surprised prosecutors regarded it as an offer they couldn't refuse.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that Gotti, who is charged with acting as the head of
the Gambino crime family since his father went to prison in 1992,
cannot afford the $24,000 a month he had to pay for security guards
in order to stay out on bail. This development may say something
about the sociology as well as the economics of families associated
with organized crime. It is said that fear of prosecution and
competition from legitimate businesses have made it harder for the
old families to find smart help.
</P>
<P>
   John J. Gotti, now serving life without parole, was reported to
have been proud that his son chose to go into the family business.
Starting Tuesday, the son will have plenty of cell time to think
about whether that was an offer he should have refused.

HULL'S ATTITUDE, EFFORT MIGHT SURPRISE BLUES FANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Earlier in the season, coach Ken Hitchcock said a trip to St.
Louis would help Brett Hull become an even bigger part of the
Stars.
</P>
<P>
   After all, a rousing game against his former team in an arena he
helped build could aid Hull in severing his ties to St. Louis _ a
city he owned long before Mark McGwire came along.
</P>
<P>
   But Hull _ who signed as a free agent with the Stars over the
summer, ending an 11-year relationship with the Blues _ missed that
Nov. 21 game because of a bruised kidney. And with all of his
success this season, the return to the Gateway City for today's 2
p.m. game could be anticlimactic.
</P>
<P>
   But Hull doesn't need any gimmicks to separate himself from the
Blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play for the Dallas Stars,'' said Hull, defiantly.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates support him, too. In fact, they say fans in St.
Louis might not recognize the new Brett Hull. He's no longer the
brash, ``floating,'' pure goal-scorer they toasted to the tune of
527 goals. Now, he's a hard-working, time-clock-punching, two-way
forward, who happens to score goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen him work harder this year than I'd seen him work in
10 years playing against him,'' Stars defenseman Craig Ludwig said.
``Honestly, he's jumped right in, he's worked hard defensively,
he's really fit in. He might not be scoring 50 goals, but what he's
contributed defensively has been well worth missing 10 or 15
goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Hitchcock: ``From a technical standpoint, he's a much more
responsible player than when we coached against him. He hasn't
wavered from the challenge that line faces every night. He hasn't
taken away from the focus of that line, he's actually added to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull, the man who once said he was able to score 86 goals in a
season by ``floating and disappearing'' on the ice, has become much
more visible. Along with Mike Modano and Jere Lehtinen, Hull plays
on the Stars' top checking line. Hitchcock matches that line
against the other team's top offensive players, believing that with
the defensive ability of Lehtinen and Modano, they will outscore
the other team's top scorers.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days with the Blues, Hull would try to outscore
opponents, for example 3-2, by throwing defensive caution to the
wind. And that would backfire in the games where he didn't score
three goals. Now, he understands that by simply outscoring an
opponent's line, 1-0, he is helping the Stars win.
</P>
<P>
   You want proof? With 987 points in 801 career games entering
this season, Hull had a minus-20 rating for his career _ he had
been on the ice for 20 more even-strength goals than his team had
scored. Hull is a plus-18 so far this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost a completely different game,'' Hull said. ``It was
difficult to adjust.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hull, a right winger, has pulled it off. Not only has he
been defensively responsible, he has added 28 goals among 52 points
_ second-best on the Stars. What's more, he has done that in only
53 games (a pace for 43 goals in an 82-game season) and he has done
it while trying to adjust to a new team and playing the first 15
games as a left winger.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made it work, he's shown he can score goals here,''
Ludwig said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Hull isn't satisfied with his offensive output. But
then again, he never is. He said he measures his performance on
goals and points and would like to push the Stars _ who are in an
offensive slump _ to score more.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can score in this system, but there's no emphasis on it.
You don't feel pressure, which I think is bad sometimes,'' Hull
said. ``You can't get lulled into `I don't have to score.' You have
to put pressure on yourself to produce.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the fans in St. Louis are going to see a Hull that's not
so different after all. While he has adapted to the Stars'
defense-first system and has been a quiet force in the dressing
room, the goal-scoring, big-mouthed Brett Hull of old still bubbles
under the surface.
</P>
<P>
   And, believe it or not, nobody wants to take that away from
Hull.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, emotion is a good thing in sports,'' Hull said wistfully.
``And a lack of it is terrible.''

EDITORIAL: TIME TO UNLOCK CITY FILES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, April 3: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After two years of trying to wheedle ordinary data out of Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani's City Hall, state Comptroller Carl McCall and his
auditors won an important victory this week in New York state's
highest court. The State Court of Appeals ruled that the
comptroller's office has the right to audit how the city has been
delivering its services in such areas as welfare, street cleaning,
parks and police.
</P>
<P>
   As a Republican running for re-election in 1997, Giuliani had
balked at the demand for performance audits by McCall, a Democrat.
The mayor labeled the requests for extra data as ``partisan'' and
gave McCall access only to financial records of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the hand of the courts ever more firmly on Giuliani's
shoulder after this latest in a series of losses on information
issues, City Hall is finally agreeing to open its files to the
comptroller's auditors. The delay might have served the mayor
politically, but it undoubtedly cost city taxpayers in unnecessary
legal bills. These are data that clearly should have been available
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Information has not come easily out of the Giuliani
administration except from a high-profile mayor who meets press and
public daily. That means a mountain of data must be funneled ever
upward to the mayor's office before it can spill into the public
domain. Thus, the comptroller is only the latest in a long line of
supplicants who eventually use a court order to pry open the city's
filing cabinets. Public advocates, citizens and media organizations
including The New York Times have been forced to file Freedom of
Information requests for the most routine city documents.
</P>
<P>
   A state Supreme Court judge ruled this week that the city's
Independent Budget Office can get information directly from city
agencies, rather than through the mayor's budget office. Public
Advocate Mark Green began over two years ago trying to review how
complaints against police were treated within the Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   After repeated stalls and two court orders, Green's lawyers are
expected to begin Monday looking at more than 700 cases. No
politician likes to pass out information that might be used by the
opposition, but too often at New York's City Hall the free flow of
information comes with an unhealthy delay and a costly legal bill.
The courts have affirmed that it is unacceptable for citizens and
the press to have to beg for information that clearly belongs to
everyone.

BASEBALL'S UPPER CRUST NEEDS TO SPLIT TV PIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sport's version of ``Les Miserables'', otherwise known as Major
League Baseball, opens Monday, the first act in a compelling
theatrical spectacle wherein the have-nots attempt to launch a
full-scale economic revolution against the haves.
</P>
<P>
   Expect a lot of bloodshed but very little romance come curtain
drop, probably sometime around the end of the 2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   The first scene is already being played out. The game's
competitive imbalance is the focus of a little study group
featuring the likes of George Mitchell and George Will.
</P>
<P>
   They'll talk about ways to give Expos, Twins and Pirates fans
hope that their boys of summer have a chance come September. Enough
hope, at least, to keep them buying tickets. Like as not, that will
mean suggesting some sort of restraint on player salaries coupled
with a modified form of franchise revenue sharing.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect too much from this committee _ it doesn't even
include representation from the players' union, which we know gets
hives at the very thought of a salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   But know that something must be done and soon. Either that or
there will be a strike/lockout to make us forget 1994 when the next
collective-bargaining agreement expires, probably after the 2001
season option year. Should that happen, baseball itself might
expire.
</P>
<P>
   When all parties get serious, though, television revenue,
specifically local TV money, ought to be at the crux of the debate,
for there lies the economic disparity that mocks the game. Anything
else is just a denial of reality, a treating of symptoms instead of
causes.
</P>
<P>
   Take the new stadiums opening or planned from Seattle to
Cincinnati, from San Francisco to Pittsburgh. A new ballpark
guarantees a franchise increased revenue from ticket sales, club
seats and suites, concessions and parking. That's swell. But soon
every club will have a new stadium and the relative benefits a
small market wannabe might earn from the latest pleasure palace
will be minimized.
</P>
<P>
   The economic impact of local TV rights means $55 million-plus a
year to George Steinbrenner's Yankees, but only $2 million or so
annually to a Montreal or Milwaukee. That disparity won't go away
without a major structural overhaul that takes more from the haves
and gives more to the have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball owners and executives look longingly at the NFL's
set-up, where franchises share equally in national TV contract
booty, the league's cash cow and the equivalent of baseball's local
TV rights deals.
</P>
<P>
   That creates a financial parity allowing even a tiny city in
northern Wisconsin to compete successfully on the field against the
largest metropolises in America.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Rangers president Tom Schieffer even
called NFL elders ``wise'' for agreeing to split up network TV
revenue way back when. And smart they were, for recognizing that
the value of the New York football Giants is ultimately diminished
if teams in markets the size of Green Bay are forced by finances to
take on the role of Washington Generals _ patsies for the big
markets' Harlem Globetrotters act.
</P>
<P>
   Well, here's news: It's never too late to wise up.
</P>
<P>
   Split up that local TV money. The current revenue-sharing
formula reallocates some local TV cash among the poor, but not
nearly enough to address the yawning competitive gap. The Yankees,
for example, keep about 80 percent of their local media dollars and
only a few million of their $55 million annual haul goes
specifically for low revenue teams.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, local media revenue should be redistributed more evenly
among all 30 teams. If everyone got the same amount, each team
would earn nearly $13 million per year and the existing disparity
among franchises would be reduced if not eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Big-market clubs would, of course, resist such a plan. They
would argue that they paid higher franchise fees for the right to
profit from the lucrative media markets in which they operate.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, they would look at the big picture. They would realize
that a Yankees game on TV doesn't have much value unless there is a
Pittsburgh or a Milwaukee to provide the opposition. Or, they would
remember the NFL model and consider the situation of a Jerry Jones.
The Cowboys owner could make a pretty good case that his club
generates more network TV revenue than the Cincinnati Bengals or
the San Diego Chargers. But he's willing to take one for the game.
</P>
<P>
   If that appeal fails, perhaps a simple buyout would work.
Baseball could collectively take out a multibillion-dollar loan and
buy the local TV rights of each of its 30 teams at fair-market
value. From the Yankees down to the Expos, each franchise would be
paid a one-time fee for those rights, whether that meant $500
million or $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   That done, Major League Baseball would own all local media
rights. All revenue from future local broadcasting contracts would
be split equally among the 30 teams. Then, the only income
disparity would come from differences in stadium revenues. At last,
even the have-nots would have hope.

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, April 3:
</P>
<P>
   Religious groups that want to engage in partisan politics have
every right to do so, but they must play by the same rules as
everyone else. A U.S. District Court judge defended this principle
this week when he ruled that a church engaging in blatantly
partisan activities can be stripped of its tax-exempt status and
its right to receive tax-deductible contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The case involved the Church at Pierce Creek in upstate New
York, which a few days before the 1992 presidential election took
out full-page ads in USA Today and The Washington Times. The ads
warned, ``Christian Beware,'' and asserted that Bill Clinton
supported ``policies that are in rebellion to God's laws.''
</P>
<P>
   They also asked ``How then can we vote for Bill Clinton?'' At
the bottom of the page was a notice that the ad had been sponsored
by the church and its pastor, and that ``Tax-deductible donations
for this advertisement gladly accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   The tax code states that tax-exempt status is available to
religious and charitable groups that do not participate in any
political campaign for or against any candidate. The New York
church brazenly violated that prohibition. Judge Paul Friedman
ruled that the IRS, in revoking the tax-exempt status, did not
violate the church's free exercise of religion or free speech. The
church can engage in partisan campaign activities, but it cannot
ask taxpayers to subsidize those activities.
</P>
<P>
   This case may also cause other churches to re-examine campaign
advocacy. A potential hazard are the millions of voter guides the
Christian Coalition distributes during election season. Some
churches have refused to pass out the guides for fear that they are
too partisan and could jeopardize their tax-exempt status. They are
right to be worried.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Election Commission has sued the coalition on
grounds that the voter guides were illegal campaign contributions
because they were coordinated with particular campaigns. The
coalition's own application for tax-exempt status is being reviewed
by the IRS, and the FEC suit that is pending could affect that
determination.
</P>
<P>
   The point of federal enforcement in both these cases is not to
silence religious organizations. The point is to make sure they
abide by federal tax and election spending and disclosure laws that
apply to others in the political arena.
</P>

N.J. SOFTWARE PROGRAMMER ARRESTED, CHARGED WITH LAUNCHING MELISSA
VIRUS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS throughout with updates and additional reporting.) (rk) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ After a global search for the author of the
fastest-spreading computer virus in history, investigators in New
Jersey arrested a 30-year-old software programmer Thursday night
and charged him with writing and launching the now-famous Melissa
virus.
</P>
<P>
   The programmer, David L. Smith, 30, was taken into custody after
FBI agents and officials from America Online helped investigators
from the New Jersey attorney general's office hone in on the
Internet access provider that was apparently first used to send the
virus, which has now infected more than 100,000 computers
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from the attorney general's Computer Analysis and
Technology Unit then spent three days sorting through records of
thousands of customers' files and electronic transmissions from the
provider, Monmouth Internet Corp. of Red Bank, N.J., and determined
that the telephone line used to send the first copy of the Melissa
virus was wired into Smith's apartment in Aberdeen Township,
according to Attorney General Peter J. Verniero.
</P>
<P>
   A law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of
anonymity said that the authorities had seized Smith's computer and
other records.
</P>
<P>
   Since March 26, when the virus was first uploaded to the
Internet newsgroup alt.sex from a stolen America Online account,
the Melissa virus spread like a malignant chain letter, invading
computer users' e-mail programs and sending itself to as many as 50
correspondents in each user's e-mail address book.
</P>
<P>
   By replicating and sending itself so rapidly, the virus clogged
and in some cases incapacitated computer networks at about 300
corporations, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Melissa was not as destructive as other viruses that
can destroy files or corrupt hard drives, technology experts say it
is an ominous threat to Internet commerce because it used a new,
and particularly efficient, method of transmission to replicate at
an extraordinarily rapid rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible that in the near future, viruses could spread
around the globe in a matter of an hour or two, and if it's a
destructive virus, do incredible amounts of damage,'' said Steve R.
White, senior manager of anti-virus research at IBM's Watson
Research Center in Hawthorne, N.Y. ``It's going to demand an entire
new way of combating them, new approaches and new technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said Smith, who apparently named the
virus after a topless dancer in Florida, was a programmer for a
software company that writes code for AT&AMP;T, but they would not
identify the company.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors and acquaintances described him as a prototypical
computer zealot.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Trautmann, who lives one floor below Smith in the Ken Garden
apartment complex in Aberdeen, said he rarely ventured out of his
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very solitary person; he was a quiet neighbor,'' said
Ms. Trautmann, a quality assurance specialist at a software
company. ``I'd hear his modem go off once in a while.''

   Smith, who was arrested at his brother's apartment in Eatontown,
N.J., was charged with interruption of public communication, theft
of computer services and wrongful access to computer systems. He
was released on $100,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Distributing a computer virus is also a federal crime, but
Verniero said he doubted federal charges would be necessary because
the New Jersey statutes provided for a possible $480,000 fine and a
maximum prison sentence of 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Although Smith was also charged with conspiracy to interrupt
public communication, Verniero would not say whether officials were
looking for other suspects. Some private anti-virus experts said
the so-called ``digital fingerprints'' on the code embedded in the
virus indicated there were at least two programmers involved.
</P>
<P>
   The Melissa virus was embedded into an e-mail attachment, and
designed to exploit a feature of the Microsoft Outlook e-mail
program, so that each time the infected document was opened, it
automatically sent itself out to as many as 50 other people.
Technology experts fear that other high tech saboteurs may use
similar techniques, known as worm programs, to transmit more
harmful viruses in the future, at speeds which far outpace the
current ability to prevent, detect or disable them.

<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The investigation was one of a growing number of criminal
inquiries which raised uncomfortable issues about the privacy
rights of Internet users and the lengths to which Internet
providers may go to prevent the authorities from gaining access to
records of their customers' transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, which was exploring whether one of its own
accounts had been used to launch the virus, tipped off New Jersey
officials that the virus may have originated from a specific
Internet protocol address, which is a number that identifies a
given computer's Internet address, at a New Jersey Internet
provider, said Verniero.
</P>
<P>
   Mark R. Stevens, operations manager for Monmouth Internet, said
the company provided New Jersey investigators with a list of names
of 12 of its customers who on March 26 used that specific address
to send and receive information to the Internet. Among the
customers was David L. Smith, whose e-mail address was
Dlsmith(AT)monmouth.com, and who later canceled his account,
Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   The state police then tracked down the possible suspects by
using ``good old-fashioned detective work,'' said Verniero, who was
joined at the news conference by Gov. Christie Whitman. Both
Verniero and Whitman seemed to go to great lengths to praise the
work of the state police. The department has been the target of
widespread criticism in recent months over allegations of racial
bias.
</P>
<P>
   There was still widespread confusion yesterday about whether
Smith was actually the shadowy virus author known as VicodinES, who
has maintained a Web site on a Florida computer.
</P>
<P>
   At Verniero's news conference Friday, New Jersey law enforcement
officials said they believed that Smith had combined several
viruses including one created by VicodinES.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not Vicodin,'' said Paul M. Loriquet, a spokesman for
Verniero. ``He is not the Vicodin guy.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Richard Smith, an independent Cambridge, Mass.,
software developer who on Monday alerted FBI officials to the fact
that David Smith's name appeared in documents found on a
Florida-based Web site, said Friday that he still believed that
David Smith and VicodinES were the same person. He noted that in
early postings VicodinES said he was in Florida, and that
authorities said David Smith had moved to New Jersey from Florida.
In addition, he said he had found David Smith's name in the
documents posted to the Vicodin web site as far back as July of
1998.
</P>
<P>
   One document written about viruses by VicodinES and signed
``peace, VIC'' on July 5, 1998, contained a notation that listed
David Smith as the most recent author, said Richard Smith.

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR HARRICK, AN HONOR THAT STINGS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the spirit of rewarding deeds at the appropriate level, I
have come up with an annual post-season collegiate athletic award
of my own: the Great Barracuda Award.
</P>
<P>
   This award acknowledges the college coach who exemplifies the
most mercenary attitude toward athletes and a particular university
over the course of a season. The award takes its name from that
ferocious tropical fish that lashes out and attacks anything that
gleams.
</P>
<P>
   The inaugural Barracuda winner is Jim Harrick, the former Rhode
Island head coach and a hands-down selection. Harrick secured the
award this week with a last-minute maneuver that left one
university looking foolish and left another to burn in the ashes of
its own ambition. I've watched Harrick for 15 years; this, by far,
is his best lowest moment.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Harrick, 60, ended a two-year stint at the
University of Rhode Island when he accepted the head coaching job
at Georgia. Or so it seemed. On Thursday morning, he called Michael
F. Adams, the University of Georgia president, and told him that he
had had a change of heart and was returning to Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Elated officials at Rhode Island subsequently arranged a spate
of happy welcome back meetings: Harrick would meet with Rhode
Island players at 5:30 p.m., with boosters at 6 p.m. and finally
the news media at 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Harrick stood up his players, and then at 6:10 called Rhode
Island officials to tell them he had changed his mind again and
decided to take the job at Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the span of 24 hours,'' one school official said Friday,
``we went from disappointment that he was leaving, being stunned
that he was coming back, to disbelief.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrick's explanation was that he got ``all wrapped up in my
family.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is innocent in this deal. Rhode Island entered into a
shaky covenant with Harrick in May 1997. Harrick needed a job,
Rhode Island wanted to go big and big time, and Harrick was
available at a bargain price.
</P>
<P>
   Harrick had guided UCLA to the 1995 national championship but
was fired the next year on charges that he falsified an expense
report in order to cover up a potential NCAA recruiting violation.
</P>
<P>
   But there were misgivings from the moment his name was mentioned
at Rhode Island. Segments of the university's faculty were not
pleased. They felt that hiring Harrick would send out the wrong
message by a school that had already suffered from the exposure of
a 1992 gambling ring that involved athletes and an incident in 1996
in which members of the football team attacked a fraternity house.
</P>
<P>
   I was on campus when Robert Carothers, the Rhode Island
president, introduced Harrick that May afternoon. Carothers
prefaced his remarks by describing the coach as a hero who reaches
the pinnacle and then falls. ``There is a moment of recognition and
realization in which the fallen hero realizes his flaw and
expresses contrition,'' Carothers said.
</P>
<P>
   Like the preacher tuned into an unsuspecting flock, Harrick gave
Rhode Island his word that he would never leave for another college
job. In November 1997, two games into his first season with Rhode
Island, he said: ``I don't want another college job. Now you never
know what happens in the future. There might be somebody that comes
in and gives you something you absolutely no way can refuse. But
that's not going to happen to me in college. This is not a stepping
stone for me. I'm not in that era. This is a fresh start for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrick took the Rams to the big time. They made the NCAA
tournament both seasons, and the first season he came within a
minute of reaching the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   After this season, Adams, the Georgia president, of all people,
told Harrick that staying at Rhode Island would be a mistake. Then
in the ultimate contradiction of this entire charade, Adams told
Harrick that Georgia wanted ``a coach who was committed to this
institution.''
</P>
<P>
   Are you kidding me?
</P>
<P>
   Harrick never had that moment of recognition. Though Friday in
Athens, Ga., a contrite Harrick swore this was it. ``I can say this
has been an experience I don't want to go through again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harrick earned about $350,000 last season at Rhode Island. He
will make a reported $550,000 a year at Georgia _ plus $100,000 a
year if he completes his four-year contract. For Georgia fans, that
is a tremendous if. Just let the NBA come calling with one of those
multimillion-dollar contracts.
</P>
<P>
   This is the essence of the Barracuda: a ferocious fish that
strikes at anything that gleams _ or in this case, anything that
glitters.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow I get the feeling Jim Harrick will be my first two-time
recipient. &QL;

MAYOR HEARS A PERSONAL STORY OF POLICE HARASSMENT FROM HIS OWN
DEPUTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also DIALLO-KILLING) 
(DW) 
 By DAN BARRY   and KEVIN FLYNN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At the height of the public furor over the police
shooting of Amadou Diallo, Deputy Mayor Rudy Washington _ the
highest-ranking black member of the Giuliani administration _ told
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani that he had been harassed more than once
by police officers for what he considered to be racial reasons,
according to people close to the administration.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting last week that was attended by other top-level
aides, Washington gave examples of how he had been hassled, even
bullied, by the police. They included an episode in which the
deputy mayor's car was pulled over by the police in Queens, the
people close to the administration said. The confrontation that
followed was so traumatic, he told the mayor, that his wife began
to cry.
</P>
<P>
   Washington declined Friday to talk about what he told the mayor
or to share his reflections as the man who often accompanies
Giuliani on visits to Harlem and other black neighborhoods in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said Friday night that he would abide by the deputy
mayor's wishes to keep their discussion private. `` ``But I can
tell you that it will be very useful in the analysis of this
situation,'' he said. ``He's exceptionally insightful.''
</P>
<P>
   Many black and Hispanic residents have long complained that some
officers are overly aggressive and even abusive in policing
minority neighborhoods. Since the Diallo shooting, those complaints
have intensified, with even businessmen, ministers and other
prominent black New Yorkers saying they have sometimes been stopped
or searched by the police without explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's testimony was only one of dozens of personal
accounts that the mayor has heard since Feb. 4, when four white
police officers killed Diallo, a West African immigrant, in a hail
of bullets in the Bronx. Without referring to Washington, the mayor
said that these discussions _ with adolescent children and civic
leaders alike _ will be ``very valuable'' in his plan to improve
relations between the police and city residents.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the recounting of these incidents has been
upsetting, Giuliani answered: ``Of course they are. What you would
want the police to do is to always treat them respectfully. We have
tried very hard to teach them that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Giuliani said, he has asked those he has met
with to go back to those who ``try to create an exaggerated, false
impression of the police and to get them to deal with the police in
a more respectful way.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting at which Washington spoke out came during the week
when, in the face of growing criticism of his response to the
Diallo shooting, the mayor launched a major effort to reach out to
black and Hispanic leaders. It could not be determined Friday
night, however, whether the mayor heard Washington's account before
or after setting up those sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting death of Diallo has led to the indictments of the
four officers, ignited demonstrations and brought drastic changes
to the elite Street Crime Unit, to which the four officers belong.
It has also presented Giuliani with one of the most trying
challenges of his five-year tenure as mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has struggled _ not always successfully, some say _ to
defend the Police Department while expressing empathy for black and
Hispanic residents who say that the police frequently harass them,
sometimes to the point of using excessive force. His aides say that
he wants to strike a balanced response that signals ``zero
tolerance'' for police misbehavior yet provides encouragement to
the majority of the city's 40,000 officers who do their job well.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Mode, a spokeswoman for Police Commissioner Howard
Safir, said Friday night that police officials were not aware of
any incident involving Washington.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   OPTIONAL CUT. STORY CAN END HERE.
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Washington, 44, is a former general contractor who has waged
several unsuccessful runs for public office in Queens. Although he
is the most prominent black member of the administration,
Washington is not usually counted among the mayor's closest
advisers. Several of the city's black leaders said that while he is
generally well-liked, he has been an ineffective liaison to black
and Hispanic neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Details of his encounter with the police in Queens remained
sketchy Friday night, but people close to the administration said
that Washington told the mayor he felt bullied by the officer who
pulled him over, and he indicated that the treatment was related to
his race. It was not clear why the deputy mayor was pulled over.
</P>
<P>
   As Washington described it, the incident might have escalated
further, but a police official passed by, recognized him as a
deputy mayor and intervened. The people who described Washington's
account said he also mentioned other experiences, but further
details could not be learned Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said that he has heard other disturbing accounts of
harassment over the last several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Rev. Floyd Flake, a prominent Queens clergyman
and former congressman who is one of Giuliani's leading black
supporters, said recently that he too had been insulted by police
because of his race. He recalled that a few years ago, when he was
still a member of Congress, a police officer in Queens used a
racial slur to address him.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said Friday night that Flake had mentioned the
incident to him. ``He shared with me his own incident,'' Giuliani
said. ``And he shared with me, in a generic way, descriptions from
his congregants that involved police officers stopping people and
not acting in a respectful way.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani cited one story in particular, told to him by the
mother of a child who had come with a youth group to discuss
experiences with the police. The woman told him that the police
stopped her, frisked her and then left, leaving her feeling
humiliated and angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``But after it was over, the female officer who was involved
came back to explain why she had done it and apologized,'' he said.
``That made a great deal of difference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the things that's missing,'' the mayor said.
``They don't often enough do that.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, he has heard of cases in which the police
stop and search innocent people during a crime investigation, but
then leave without an explanation or apology. ``So the person would
leave without any understanding of why this had happened,'' he
said.

 &HT;    Woman trapped by seat belt as passenger train bore down
 &HT;    By Bill Douthat and A. Scharnhorst
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ As the Amtrak Silver Meteor charged
toward them, Michelle Fuente and Caroline Taveras had just enough
time to throw open the doors of the black Oldsmobile and race out
of the train's path. In the back seat, 19-year-old Jennifer Fuente
was trapped, struggling with her seat belt.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Fuente died Thursday night in the back of her parents'
Oldsmobile, as the force of the passenger train shoved the car
1,200 feet down the track, twisting it into the shape of a sickle.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Fuente _ Jennifer's 22-year-old sister _ had stopped
the Oldsmobile just before 8 p.m. in a westbound lane of Summit
Boulevard as the warning lights began flashing at the CSX railroad
crossing, investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   Behind them, Pablo Valle, trying to beat the train, sped his
Ford Mustang toward the tracks as the crossing gates started to
come down, witnesses said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Valle's passengers tried to warn him: ``We said `Stop! Stop!' ''
said Julio Cordero, 12, who was in the Mustang's back seat, ``and
the boy in the front seat yelled, `Watch out!' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Valle misjudged the distance between the cars and the right
front of the Mustang clipped the left rear of the Oldsmobile,
spinning both cars into the train crossing, investigators said. The
Fuentes' car turned 180 degrees and came to rest on the tracks
facing east. Valle's car stopped about 50 feet west of the tracks,
facing northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer ``had time to get out, but she couldn't take the seat
belt off,'' Julio said.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Highway Patrol investigators said it appeared Valle was
not paying attention, but they have not decided whether to file
charges, said Lt. Pembrook Burrows. It will take about a month to
complete toxicology tests and present a case to the state
attorney's office, Burrows said.
</P>
<P>
   Valle wasn't supposed to be on the road: His driver license has
been suspended since late last year after he failed to pay a
traffic ticket, records show. He has had several tickets since
then. He could not be reached for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Fuente, of Lake Clarke Shores, had minor injuries.
Valle, 33, of West Palm Beach and two of his four teen-age
passengers also were hurt, the FHP said. They were treated at St.
Mary's Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Taveras, 19, of suburban West Palm Beach, was more seriously
injured and was hospitalized at St. Mary's. She was in fair
condition Friday.

USC'S THOMAS WON'T RECEIVE RELEASE UNTIL NEXT WEEK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC freshman quarterback Jason Thomas still
intends to transfer, but he will not receive his official release
before next week.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' parents met with USC athletic director Mike Garrett,
coach Paul Hackett, offensive coordinator Hue Jackson and
quarterbacks coach Ken O'Brien on Friday. Jason Thomas did not
attend the meeting because he had a class.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Hackett was hopeful that Thomas could remain
at USC, but his father said nothing had changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told them Jason wants to leave. We're coming to a meeting
of the minds that they won't hold him back,'' Charles Thomas said.
``I got the impression they are grudgingly resigning themselves to
the fact Jason is going to leave but they want Jason to tell
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Thomas and his family are scheduled to meet with Garrett
and Hackett on Tuesday, and Thomas is expected to ask for his
formal release.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going to change anything,'' Charles Thomas
said. ``Jason isn't returning to spring practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what it would take for his son to stay at USC, Charles
Thomas said, ``Unless Hackett calls a press conference to say Jason
is going to be given a 50-50 shot to start at USC.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Thomas has said his son was unhappy after being told by
Hackett he would compete with Mike Van Raaphorst for the No. 2
quarterback spot. Thomas wants a chance to challenge starter Carson
Palmer in USC's spring practice.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett was still optimistic Friday about Thomas' situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very, very positive meeting,'' Hackett said. ``It was
about the state of affairs here how USC and Jason Thomas can be a
successful match. There's a digesting process going on here.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Thomas said his son has not decided where he will
transfer. He did say that former USC coach John Robinson, currently
at Nevada-Las Vegas, has spoken to Jackson, and said the Rebels
were prepared to build their offense around Thomas if he
transferred to UNLV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say Vegas would have as good a shot as anyone else,''
Charles Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   USC has informed Charles Thomas that it will not allow Jason to
transfer to a Pacific-10 Conference school.

BRAND WINS WOODEN AWARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If they had voted Tuesday, after Connecticut's
Richard Hamilton scored 27 points in the national title game, it
might have been different.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Wooden Award ballots were due March 22 _ before the
Final Four _ and Duke's Elton Brand was the the easy winner Friday
with 4,312 votes. Hamilton finished fifth (2,865 votes), behind
Utah point guard Andre Miller, Miami (Ohio) forward Wally
Szczerbiak, and Michigan State point guard Mateen Cleaves.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was no surprise. Brand, a 6-foot-8 sophomore
forward, has dominated the postseason awards as Duke dominated the
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all mean a lot,'' he said, ``but some mean a little more
than others _ like this one, because of the players that have won
it before me and (having) John Wooden's name on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The finalists seemingly spanned the spectrum of college
commitment. Miller and Szczerbiak stayed through their senior
seasons, while Brand, Hamilton and Cleaves are considering early
departures for the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gone through school the conventional way,'' said
Szczerbiak, who with 23.7 points and 8.9 rebounds this season is
expected to be a top-five pick. ``I didn't start as a freshman and
... I broke out as a senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only this year was I vaulted into the spotlight and looked at
like a real NBA prospect. I had to stay, no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not the case with Brand, also a likely top-five pick,
and Hamilton, whose draft value soared with his Final Four
performance. Both said they will discuss their options in the
coming weeks. Brand would be the first Duke player to leave early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in any rush, but it seems everyone else is,'' Brand
said.
</P>
<P>
   Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski will undergo hip replacement surgery
Monday and did not attend the award ceremony at the L.A. Athletic
Club.
</P>
<P>
   New award: Former North Carolina coach Dean Smith received the
inaugural Legends of Coaching Award for lifetime contributions. In
addition to winning two NCAA titles and coaching Michael Jordan,
James Worthy, Mitch Kupchak and Phil Ford, Smith was one of the
game's great innovators. He popularized multiple substitutions,
changing defense and the four-corners offense.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about reports that Jordan will play for the Charlotte
Hornets and Smith will become an executive with the team, Smith
said, ``I have no interest in moving from Chapel Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Quote of the Day: Miller, asked about the possibility of being
drafted by the Clippers: ``That's the last team I'd want to play
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Quote of the Day II: Wooden, asked about UCLA coach Steve
Lavin's new $578,000 contract: ``I've always said I don't think
coaches should receive more than heads of departments in college.
But if they'd given me more than $32,500 my last year, I'd have
taken it.''

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Cruise missile explosions shook downtown
Belgrade early Saturday morning, devastating both the Yugoslav and
Serbian Interior Ministry buildings and sending flames at least 12
stories high.
</P>
<P>
   A series of enormous blasts wrenched a rainy Belgrade awake at
about 1 a.m. Saturday, the first time in 10 days of NATO airstrikes
that the heavily populated center of the Yugoslav capital was hit.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters and emergency workers rushed to the area but seemed
unable to control the fires, which swept through the concrete and
glass buildings. Instead they struggled to keep the fires from
spreading to other buildings in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The two buildings face one another across Kneza Milosa and are
only a few hundred yards from a large university medical complex
that contains 4,000 of Belgrade's 5,000 hospital beds, according to
the city's deputy mayor, Milan Bozic.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav Defense Ministry and Army general headquarters are
farther up the street from the interior ministries.
</P>
<P>
   As the flames burned through the buildings, the street lights
along Kneza Milosa continued to function.
</P>
<P>
   The missile strikes made good on NATO's vow to bring the war in
Kosovo home to the Serbian and Yugoslav power structure of
President Slobodan Milosevic, but it was unclear whether they would
hasten an end to his war in the southern Serb province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It is the troops and police of the Interior Ministry who have
been most responsible for the war against the Kosovo Liberation
Army and for driving ethnic Albanian civilians from their homes in
Kosovo province. While NATO has been attacking police and army
units in Kosovo, this is the first attack on the central
headquarters of the security forces that are an important pillar of
Milosevic's government.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear if there were any people in the
buildings, after all of NATO's warnings over the past few days that
government buildings would be hit in downtown Belgrade. If there
were people inside, it was hard to imagine that they could survive
the conflagrations.
</P>
<P>
   It was a rainy night in Belgrade, with cloud cover, but the
cruise missiles are unaffected by clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian state television immediately began broadcasting pictures
of the destruction and the flames, video that was immediately
picked up and broadcasted around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said seven cruise missiles had been launched
from American ships and an eighth was launched from a British
submarine at an undisclosed target.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO's attacks against air-defense systems and units in
Kosovo have so far failed to stop the Serbian offensive against the
ethnic Albanians, NATO officials have warned that its targets would
be expanded.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes marked a sharp escalation _ to Phase 3, as NATO
calls it _ in the campaign to force Milosevic to accept a
Western-drafted peace plan for nearly complete autonomy for Kosovo
that would include the introduction of nearly 30,000 NATO
peacekeeping troops.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, NATO forces blasted bridges, army barracks and other
targets, while Yugoslavia responded with television reports about
the three servicemen who were captured. To bolster Yugoslavia's
argument that the men were captured inside Kosovo, and not in
Macedonia, television showed interviews with villagers in
Slavujedac, on the Kosovo side, saying that the men's Humvee had
traveled through the town and did not stop when ordered to do so by
Yugoslav officers.
</P>
<P>
   The official Tanjug news agency quoted a Pristina official,
Jovica Jovanovic, saying that a military court has opened an
investigation into the case of the three soldiers, collecting
evidence to see if they should be brought to trial.
</P>
<P>
   There was no response to President Clinton's demands that they
be released, and no indication of where they were being held.
</P>

<P>
   To gear up for hard times, the Yugoslav government said it would
start rationing gasoline and diesel fuel. Vehicle owners would be
able to get fuel coupons from the police.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Milosevic moved to control one of the few remaining
sources of independent journalism here, Radio B-92. B-92, which had
its transmitter disabled just before the bombs fell but which was
broadcasting on satellite and the internet, was silenced early
Friday morning. Police arrived and the general manager was fired
and replaced by a Milosevic loyalist, putting the station
effectively under government control. The staff was instructed to
go home and return on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the mandatory work rules in effect during this state of
war, the staff may be prosecuted if they do not work to the beat of
the new drummer. But the station's editor-in-chief, Veran Matic,
vowed at a press conference not to ``collaborate'' and said the
regime wanted to destroy one of the last symbols of a free press
here.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, a number of other independent newspapers and
radio stations were closed throughout Kosovo, as well as Radio 021
in Novi Sad, Serbia's second-largest city.
