MICROSOFT OFFERS TO CHANGE SOME BUSINESS PRACTICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
 and CHARLES POPE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft on Wednesday said it would change some
business practices to avoid what it called the government's
``draconian'' proposal to split the company in two.
</P>
<P>
   The Redmond, Wash., software giant rejected the breakup proposed
by the Department of Justice and 17 of the 19 plaintiff states,
consenting instead to ease controls it had imposed on computer
makers, share more technical information, and stop trying to
control whether customer companies can also sell non-Microsoft
software.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's proposal contained few surprises, largely conforming
to media predictions over the past 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also laid out a range of timetable options for future
proceedings that could postpone into 2001 a judge's order on how
Microsoft should be curbed from continuing to break federal
antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs quickly dismissed Microsoft's proposal as
inadequate, while Washington state politicians jumped to defend a
company that is vital to their region's economic well-being. One
legal expert said it reflects ``a number of wise choices'' and is
``well thought-out.''
</P>
<P>
   In an eight-page document filed with Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson after the close of the stock markets Wednesday, Microsoft
agreed to refrain from some of the conduct that the judge on April
3 ruled violated the Sherman Antitrust Act.
</P>
<P>
   It agreed to let computer vendors display icons for
non-Microsoft software, offer their own Internet sign-up process,
delete the Internet Explorer icon from pre-installed copies of
Windows, and permit buyers to choose any browser as their default
and to remove the IE icon if that's not their choice. IE will
remain part of the operating system, however.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said it won't promote any product to induce
another party to limit how much non-Microsoft software it
distributes. And it said it will share with any commercial software
vendor some technical information _ not the source code the
plaintiffs' proposal demands, but only ``information already made
available to the development community at large'' on how to write
applications that run under Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Even that disclosure, Microsoft said, must protect the company's
intellectual property, and may be subject to fees. Microsoft says
the plaintiffs' proposal ``confiscates'' Microsoft's intellectual
property, which chairman Bill Gates has long maintained is
essential to competition in the software industry.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's proposal is far less drastic than that of the
Justice Department and 17 plaintiffs, which seeks to split
Microsoft into two companies, one dealing with the Windows
operating system and the other with applications such as Office.
The two companies would be limited in their interactions.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the 19 states joining in the suit, Ohio and Illinois,
advocate steps short of a breakup.
</P>
<P>
   Under the governments' proposal, Microsoft would also be
required to widely disclose source code and other information about
how applications connect to Windows. And the plaintiffs impose more
stringent restrictions than Microsoft on how it can deal with
computer makers.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate 16-page filing, Microsoft on Wednesday also set
out five timing scenarios, keyed to which pieces of whose proposal
Jackson is considering.
</P>
<P>
   The quickest resolution would be reached if Jackson accepts
Microsoft's proposal, either as a final decree or as an interim
measure that would be put in place while Microsoft appeals
Jackson's ruling that it broke the law.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme, if Jackson rejects Microsoft's proposal
and fully accepts that of the plaintiffs, Microsoft said it will
need until December to prepare its case.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Jackson accepted the least extreme remedy in the
antitrust case, Microsoft would appeal his conclusions that it's a
lawbreaker, chief counsel Bill Neukom said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever it begins, the remedy hearing will likely resemble a
full-blown trial, with witnesses called and cross-examined,
documents admitted into evidence, and its own set of deadlines,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs are scheduled to respond to Microsoft's proposal
by May 17, and a hearing on each side's proposals _ not the remedy
hearing _ is still scheduled for May 24.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs lambasted Wednesday's filing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's proposal is ineffective and filled with
loopholes,'' the Justice Department said in a prepared statement.
``It would not have prevented Microsoft from engaging in many of
the illegal acts found by the District Court, nor would it prevent
the company from using its monopoly power in the future to engage
in the same kind of illegal behavior to crush new innovations.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials defended their effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has invited the court to destroy or hobble an
American company that is a model of success in the high technology
arena and to do so explicitly to reshape the single most productive
and envied industry in the United States. In contrast, Microsoft
has filed with the Court (a proposal) that fully addresses the
antitrust violations found by the Court in a manner consistent with
the law,'' Microsoft said in its legal papers.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Kovacic, an antitrust expert who teaches at George
Washington University in Washington, D.C., praised Microsoft's
filings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they made a number of wise choices Wednesday: making
an alternative proposal instead of saying `Nothing will do; all
this is nonsense'; writing a strong memo in support of their
proposal, and setting out their timetable in an appropriately
cautionary way.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the sliding-scale timetable ``is one way of saying `A
rush job won't do; breaking up the world's most significant
business enterprise is not something to approach casually,' and
that's an important point to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Kovacic predicted Jackson won't rule out any possible remedy and
will set the hearing to begin in September.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Washington state's most prominent political figures,
including Sens. Slade Gorton and Patty Murray, remain firmly behind
a company that is important to the state's economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's objections to the proposed break-up and
restrictions on their business practices are justified,'' Murray,
D-Wash., said. ``I remain confident that Microsoft is right on the
facts and ... am hopeful that a reasonable outcome will be found
without breaking up Microsoft.``
</P>
<P>
   Gorton, who has long complained about the Justice Department's
handing of the case, was even more blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call on the Department of Justice and Judge Jackson to
listen to reason and leave the high tech industry alone,'' the
Republican senator said. ``The job growth fueled by Microsoft has
been phenomenal. Microsoft's hard-working employees have changed
the face of technology and positively impacted the daily lives of
millions of Americans who reap the benefits of their innovative
products. Why do we want to crush that success?''
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., also came to the
company's defense, saying that public opinion remains behind
Microsoft and complaining that advancement in the fast moving
software world would suffer if the government prevails.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government should not do anything to hamper
innovation and the government would do that'' if it broke the
company apart, he said.

 &HT;    South Carolina to move rebel flag
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Columbia, S.C. _ On South Carolina's Confederate Memorial Day, a
day the battle flag of the Confederacy burned literally and
figuratively, the state House voted to remove the controversial
banner from the capitol dome.
</P>
<P>
   As the votes were tabulated at 10:11 p.m. _ more than 12 hours
after the day's session convened _ legislators looked up anxiously
at the two large voting boards on either side of the chamber, like
nervous bettors watching the tote board at the track. The bill
passed 63-56.
</P>
<P>
   Just minutes before the vote, House Speaker David Wilkins
(R-Greenville) sighed and said to one of his colleagues, ``We're
right on top of it. It's tied.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins had taken the well to personally encourage support for a
compromise the Senate approved last month. The House slightly
modified the bill during two full days of debate.
</P>
<P>
   The principal remaining difference between the House and Senate
versions is how high the flag will fly and whether it will be
illuminated. The House bill approved Wednesday calls for a 30-foot
flag pole and lights at night. The Senate version says 20 feet for
the flag pole and no illumination.
</P>
<P>
   In the lobby between the House and Senate chambers, almost
directly below the capitol dome, Wilkins said he was proud of the
way his 123 members conducted themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a defining moment for our state,'' Wilkins said. ``I
think it's a giant step forward. This is a very decisive and
dignified action on the part of the South Carolina House. There
will be those that criticize this action, this compromise, some
that say we went too far, some saying we didn't go far enough. The
bottom line is we got the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would remove the battle flag from the capitol dome and
move it to a prominent soldiers' memorial on the grounds July 1.
</P>
<P>
   It's expected South Carolina's decision will heat up a similar
debate in Georgia, which incorporates the Confederate battle emblem
into the state flag. Civil rights groups have threatened economic
boycotts of the Peach State if legislators don't change Georgia's
flag next year.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, House Democrats struggled throughout the day
to find a compromise that black House members would support. But
their last-ditch efforts failed Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   That left many in the black legislative caucus in the ironic
position of having to vote to leave the Confederate battle flag _
co-opted as a symbol by some white supremacists groups _ over the
dome, where it has flown since 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the Republican-controlled House passed a bill that
removes the battle flag from the dome and both chambers of the
General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Only three of 26 black House members voted for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The plan's great failing, according to many black legislators,
is that the battle flag would move to an even more prominent place
on the capitol grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That, at best, sends a mixed message and, I think, even a bad
message,'' said House Speaker Pro Tempore Terry Haskins
(R-Greenville). ``If the black members didn't vote for a plan that
takes the flag off the dome, that's hard to explain.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan includes flying a square battle flag at the 38-foot
granite Confederate Soldiers Monument on the north mall of the
capitol, a highly visible intersection of Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does not heal. This does not come close to healing,''
said House Minority leader Gilda Cobb-Hunter (D-Orangeburg), a key
black legislator. She voted against the bill. ``I'm tired of
sacrificing and giving all the time,'' Rep. Leon Howard, a black
Democrat from Columbia, said during a party caucus meeting before
the formal House debate. ``I'm not willing to sacrifice anymore. We
need to stop sacrificing principles.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
launched a tourism boycott of South Carolina on Jan. 1 and vowed to
keep it in place until the battle flag comes down. Officials from
the state NAACP monitored House debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is that not much there excites us,'' Dwight
James, South Carolina NAACP executive director, said outside the
House chamber.
</P>
<P>
   During a lunch recess, a Columbia activist _ Kevin Gray _ burned
a Nazi banner and a Confederate flag outside the capitol. The Nazi
flag burned quickly; the Confederate banner wouldn't ignite at
first. A group waving Rebel flags began signing ``Dixie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sign _ a sign the flag shouldn't come down,'' said
56-year-old mailman Marion Hutson, who stood at the Confederate
memorial all day, dressed in the gray, woolen Civil War uniform of
a Charleston infantryman.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, vandals spray-painted in red a message on
the Confederate Soldiers Monument: ``Take it down. Don't put it
here.'' In tempered disagreement, legislators argued about
heritage, honor, respect and racism.
</P>
<P>
   Most black legislators rejected the Democratic war memorial
compromise because it would fly the Rebel flag over the dome once a
year, on Confederate Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Joe Neal (D-Hopkins), head of the black
legislative caucus, said the battle flag over the dome perpetuates
an insult against people of color in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want the flag to fly,'' Neal said from the House
floor, ``even for a day, even for a minute, even for an hour
because we think it's inappropriate,''

COMMENTARY: GIULIANI'S DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Adds that Hazelton is Nathan's hometown in 13th graf begin: ``Just
days later...''; SUBS 16th graf to express stronger opinion)  
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You could tell from the headlines, especially in the
tabloids, that something had to happen _ that, as Donna Hanover
said last week in an emotional appearance outside St. Patrick's
Cathedral, ``decisions'' had to be made.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, his own voice halting and at times trembling, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani told reporters that he and Hanover were
considering a formal separation.
</P>
<P>
   That's one decision. Soon, I think, will come the decision to
abandon the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   In disclosing his plans to separate from Hanover, the mayor
said, ``I'm motivated by all the tremendous invasion of privacy
that's taken place in everyone's life _ my family, Judith Nathan's
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathan has been described by Giuliani as his ``very good
friend,'' and Wednesday he said, ``I'm going to need her more now
than maybe I did before.''
</P>
<P>
   I rooted for the longest time for a Senate race between Rudolph
Giuliani and Hillary Rodham Clinton. This was purely out of
self-interest. I make my living running around with a pocketful of
paper and a Bic pen, chasing stories. And I couldn't imagine a
story that would be more fun than all-out warfare between these two
huge, aggressive and controversial personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Way back in November 1998 I wrote: ``I have found nothing to
substantiate the rumors that Hillary Rodham Clinton is interested
in running for Moynihan's seat. But the idea of a Senate race
between Clinton and Rudolph Giuliani is such a splendid one that it
must be kept alive at all costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the story has certainly been incredible. The real events
have trumped anything I might have imagined.
</P>
<P>
   But it has not been fun.
</P>
<P>
   You have to be very twisted indeed to get a kick out of public
figures coming down with cancer and the very public disintegration
of a marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The combat I imagined was of the political variety, Hillary
against Rudy, Democrat against Republican, one narcissist against
another.
</P>
<P>
   The dynamics changed radically two weeks ago when Giuliani
announced that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Just days later came stories in the tabloids about the mayor's
relationship with Nathan. The mayor acknowledged they were friends,
and that has been the hot topic ever since. The tabloids went into
overdrive. There were daily stories, with photos, about Nathan. The
history of the relationship was chronicled. Her wardrobe was
analyzed and re-analyzed. A media encampment was set up outside her
East Side high-rise. Other reporters and photographers were
dispatched to Hazleton, Pa., her hometown, to get reactions from
Nathan's relatives.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday it was clear that the frenzy wasn't about to abate,
and top Republican officials were openly concerned about the effect
it was having on the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's response was to announce that he and Hanover would
pursue a formal separation. And Hanover called reporters to Gracie
Mansion where she spoke tearfully about problems that went back
several years.
</P>
<P>
   That tearful appearance was the crusher. The mayor's candidacy
will not survive it. And I would expect his exit to come sooner
rather than later. Like most other observers, I doubt that he ever
really wanted to go to the Senate. He's a guy who likes to command.
</P>
<P>
   And while he has tried mightily to seem otherwise, he's also
human. And that means he is laboring beneath an almost unimaginable
load of physical and emotional stress. He is the mayor of the
nation's largest city. He is fighting the disease that killed his
father. His marriage has unraveled. The person he seems closest to
is being hounded day and night by the media, and that will only
grow worse. The prognosis he has received from his doctors is very
good, but the treatment is rough nevertheless, and it is likely, at
least to some extent, to be debilitating. And after going through
that, his immediate task would be to engage in a titanic, historic
battle for the Senate against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   I expect Giuliani to bow out of this race, regain his health,
settle the difficulties in his personal life and then come back,
renewed, to run in some future campaign.

HENDERSON WILL BE STAYING WITH METS, AT LEAST FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Twenty-nine teams had a chance to get a Hall of
Fame leadoff hitter over the past two days, and every one passed.
So the Mets held on to Rickey Henderson, and he started in left
field and led off against the Pittsburgh Pirates on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have no intention of releasing Henderson now, and
because no other team was willing to pay the $20,000 waiver price
to claim him and pay him the remainder of his $2 million salary
this year, the Mets are essentially stuck with the contract. The
Mets had placed Henderson on outright waivers, as it turns out,
meaning that if another team claimed him, the Mets would have had
to let him go. Henderson cleared waivers at 1 p.m. Wednesday when
no team made a claim.
</P>
<P>
   That the Mets risked losing him in such a manner is an
indication that the club no longer believes the slumping Henderson
is worth having at the salary he makes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they've been trying to move him for some time, and
they probably just weren't able to,'' an official from another team
said. ``A lot of times clubs will run even superstars through
outright waivers to see if someone will claim him for $20,000.
Basically you're saying: `I'm giving this guy to you for $20,000. I
get $20,000 and get rid of his contract.'''
</P>
<P>
   With no team agreeing to do that, the Mets plan to hold on to
Henderson in hopes that he will start producing. Baseball's career
stolen-base king, Henderson entered Wednesday night's game with
only two stolen bases and a .207 batting average.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception that anything's been done to release Rickey is
not accurate,'' said Mets General Manager Steve Phillips, who is
prohibited by baseball rules from acknowledging if he has put a
player on waivers. ``If we wanted to release Rickey, we would
release Rickey. If you want to release a player, you release a
player. You don't have to wait for anything else to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The 41-year-old Henderson is struggling, but the Mets have no
players on their major league roster who are proven leadoff
hitters. They do have a prototype leadoff man at Class AAA Norfolk,
23-year-old Jason Tyner, a former No. 1 draft pick, but he is not
considered ready for the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not too many true speed guys out there,'' a
different official from another team said. ``The Mets have two of
them, but one's too young and one's too old.''
</P>
<P>
   There is always the possibility that Henderson will rediscover
the form he showed last year, when he hit .315, his highest batting
average in nine years, and had a .423 on-base percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson has been working on limiting the movement in his head
when he hits, and he said he is feeling better at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he has anything to prove,'' Manager Bobby
Valentine said. ``He has a lot to improve, and I think that's what
we're dealing with. He's working and that's what we're hoping
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson said he did not know exactly what happened with the
waiver situation, but said that nothing about it would bother him.
</P>
<P>
   But Henderson bristled when asked if the Mets may have been
trying to send him a message, setting off a lengthy monologue on
what he perceives to be the negative news-media coverage of him. He
said he has been hurt by stories suggesting he does not play hard
and is a bad influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's negative always,'' he told reporters. ``Y'all want me out
of New York? I'll go play somewhere else. I've been playing 21
years. I've done more than most anybody in this ballpark has done.
But the only thing is negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get in the paper and put some headlines positive about Rickey.
Because this is ridiculous. This is a joke to me. I don't play this
game with my dignity and my heart for it to be a joke.''

HARRAH'S POPS BACK INTO LEAD AMONG KC AREA CASINOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Kansas City's white-hot casino market cooled
slightly in April to a merely red-hot $44.7 million _ the
second-richest month in riverboat gambling history.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime market-share leader Harrah's North Kansas City Casino &AMP;
Hotel seized back the lead from Station Casino Kansas City, which
had been out front four of the previous six months.
</P>
<P>
   And the Flamingo Hilton Casino, which could be operating under
new ownership as soon as June 1, posted its biggest market share
ever while grabbing a piece of the monthly ``loosest slots'' title.
</P>
<P>
   Harrah's executives were in Atlantic City, N.J., for corporate
meetings this week and could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to give up the market-share lead,'' said John V.
Finamore, Station's Midwest president. ``But it was a good month
for us. We had a great first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that's encouraging is we grew year over year,
and Harrah's didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite grabbing the monthly market-share honors, Harrah's was
the lone casino operation in Kansas City that failed to outperform
itself from April 1999.
</P>
<P>
   While Harrah's turnstile admissions were up 7 percent from a
year ago, revenue was down 2 percent, to $15 million from $15.4
million. Rival Station saw attendance blossom 21 percent while
revenue grew a modest 2 percent, to $14.7 million from $14.4
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got spoiled a little bit,'' Finamore said, after Station
posted $16.3 million in revenue in March, a record for the Kansas
City market.
</P>
<P>
   Finamore and others had predicted some market shrinkage after
local boats' $48.2 million performance in March, which shattered
all records for revenue and admissions. March and July
traditionally are Kansas City casinos' strongest months.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue figures represent gamblers' combined net losses after
all winners have been paid.
</P>
<P>
   The Flamingo finished the month with a 16 percent market share,
the largest slice of the pie it has claimed since January 1997,
when Station Casino opened and filled out the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   The Flamingo's $7.2 million April and 435,000 admissions were
both second best in the boat's history. The Flamingo's house
records were set a month earlier, when 471,000 patrons left $7.4
million behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working really hard on customer service issues and
marketing,'' said acting General Manager David Miller. ``Hopefully
it will continue to pay off.''
</P>
<P>
   Open boarding, which began in Kansas City last winter and
eliminated restrictive casino entry times, has benefited one-boat
operations such as the Flamingo far more than twin-vessel
facilities such as Station and Harrah's, which had staggered
boarding hours and shorter waits.
</P>
<P>
   But the Flamingo also has heavily promoted its ``loosest quarter
slots'' status since briefly capturing The Star's six-month-average
award for 25-cent machines in November while posting the best
payback rates for players three of the past six months.
</P>
<P>
   Each month the Missouri Gaming Commission reports revenue and
admission figures for the prior month, but slot-machine and
table-game payback rates are not reported until 40 days after the
end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   For March, Flamingo and the Argosy Riverside Casino finished in
a dead heat for the best quarter-slots average over the past six
months _ 94.253 percent of all 25-cent tokens wagered were paid
back to players in the form of small and large jackpots.
</P>
<P>
   Quarter-denomination slots are the most popular and plentiful
machines and typically generate around 45 percent of all gambling
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Mississippi-based Isle of Capri Casinos Inc. will go
before the Kansas City Port Authority seeking approval of its
proposed $33.5 million purchase of the Flamingo and assignment of
the city's riverfront land lease.
</P>
<P>
   If the Port Authority agrees, the Missouri Gaming Commission
could grant a state gambling license before the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Isle executives have said they expect to spend around $15
million redecorating the casino in the company's trademark
Caribbean themes.

WELFARE CONSULTANT WITH NO CONTRACT SAYS NYC RENEGED ON DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Va.)   By ERIC LIPTON and CHRISTOPHER DREW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A top city welfare official agreed to pay a Wisconsin
company $1.1 million for consulting services it provided last year
even though no written contract existed and no competitive bidding
for the work had taken place, an arrangement the city comptroller
says violated standard contracting procedures.
</P>
<P>
   From April 1999 until last week, city welfare officials asked
Kaiser Group, of Waukesha, Wis., to provide advice on placing
welfare recipients in jobs, gave the company an office and promised
to find a way to pay it retroactively, said Peter E. Kaiser, the
company's president.
</P>
<P>
   But Kaiser said that the city had ultimately never paid his
company for the work, and that last week, after a review of the
arrangement by the mayor's office, his staff was ordered to vacate
its city office.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser said he could not explain why the city had reneged on the
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told to continue on, and it would be worked out,''
Kaiser said this week.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said Wednesday that they had intended to pay
Kaiser for its work but that the mayor's office reversed that plan
in December.
</P>
<P>
   City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, who has not formally reviewed
the city's dealings with Kaiser, said that no company should be
providing services to the city unless it has a contract to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The latest contracting problems come as City Hall lawyers and
contracting officers are scrambling to review a series of
multimillion-dollar welfare-to-work contracts awarded by the Human
Resources Administration that are now the subject of investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan in the last week has
subpoenaed bid documents, e-mail messages and other city
correspondences involving other welfare contracts, a city official
said. The city has until Friday morning to turn over its records
related to $104 million worth of these contracts it intended to
give to Maximus, a McLean, Va., company, the city official said.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin officials said this week that they were also auditing
records about Maximus. The company also is major welfare-to-work
contractor there, and it recently acknowledged that it mistakenly
charged Wisconsin's welfare-to-work program for an unspecified
amount of bills associated with pursuing the New York City
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Maximus and Kaiser Group are among the handful of consultants
hired by the New York City Human Resources Administration after
Jason A. Turner, a former Wisconsin state official, was appointed
commissioner by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, who built himself a national reputation in Wisconsin
while helping lead that state's welfare-to-work effort in the
mid-1990s, was hired by Giuliani to figure out a way to encourage
thousands of able-bodied adults on welfare to leave city assistance
programs by finding jobs in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   The city has long hired outside consultants to help it provide
services to the poor and disadvantaged. What differed after Turner
arrived, several former and current city officials said, is that
the new commissioner felt that he needed to retain several outside
experts quickly to provide him advice on how to reorganize the
agency's operations.
</P>
<P>
   A New York University political science professor, Lawrence
Mead, was brought in one day a week to provide advice for about
$1,000 a day, city officials said. An executive at a conservative
social-services research organization, the Hudson Institute of
Indianapolis, was retained. That executive, Andrew Bush, ultimately
was selected for a permanent high-level job as an agency
administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser Group began providing advice to the Human Resources
Administration in October 1998, when the company was hired under a
contract with the State University at Albany. The university had
access to state and federal financing aimed at helping local
governments tackle the challenge of welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene J. Monaco, special assistant to the provost at the Nelson
A. Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy at the State
University at Albany, said that the state hired Kaiser Group after
the company was highly recommended for the job by Mark Hoover, the
city's first deputy welfare commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser, his staff and two subcontractors were assigned to assist
a city effort to convert its welfare enrollment centers into
so-called job centers, which put more of an emphasis on finding
employment than simply distributing benefits for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   But after the company completed $541,300 worth of work, the
arrangement with the State University expired at the end of March
1999. The city officials asked the state to extend the deal, but
the state said that any further work would have to be paid for by
the city through its own contracting process, Monaco said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser said his company was advised by city officials to not
worry about the financing issues. And he said his project manager,
Grant Collins, continued to work out of an office at the city
agency's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   But by late 1999, Kaiser said, he became concerned about delays
in payment and how much the city owed him, and he said he asked
Hoover for assurances that he would be paid.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser said he received a letter from Hoover last Dec. 8,
notifying him that the company would be paid $1.1 million for its
work from April through the end of the year. Kaiser said the letter
promised that the payment would be made as part of more than $3
million in business the agency was expecting to give Kaiser's
company over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Sproles, a spokeswoman for the Human Resources
Administration, did not dispute this account in her statement,
noting that the agency had initially ``intended to reimburse Kaiser
for services performed in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   But she added that under advice of the Mayor's Office of
Contracting, city officials, in mid-December 1999, changed their
minds, deciding that the proposed new contract with Kaiser Group
should cover only services starting this year. Kaiser said he was
not informed about the reversal until last week.
</P>
<P>
   Hevesi said the entire episode with Kaiser reflected a
widespread laxity in the contracting procedures at the city's
welfare agency. In recent months, the Giuliani administration has
dismissed Hevesi's criticisms of the agency's contracting
procedures as politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is improper to have vendor work without a contract,''
Hevesi said. ``Such work would be unauthorized.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It means that an agency is spending taxpayer money
without going through the legal procedures that insure that money
is spent properly.''

METS SUFFER A BAD CASE OF THE SHOULD'VE-BEENS 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ There were so many positives that could have come
from the Mets' game against the Pittsburgh Pirates on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, they were getting the best of Rickey Henderson. The
middle of their order produced a big inning that gave one of their
most reliable starters, Rick Reed, a five-run lead. They knocked
out one of the National League's most effective starters and got
into the Pirates' bullpen in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, the Mets lost, 13-9, and in the process allowed
20 hits in a game for the first time since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The five-run lead was the largest the Mets have blown this year.
Reed wound up allowing six runs. The bullpen was even worse. And
when things unraveled in a gruesome seventh inning, Henderson was
at the center.
</P>
<P>
   Six hours before game time, the Mets learned they still had the
41-year-old left fielder because every other team had passed on him
in the two days after the Mets put him on outright waivers. It
would be the Mets' responsibility to pay Henderson's $2 million
salary, which he earns to do such things as he did in the first
inning against the Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson singled, stole second _ it was just his third steal
this year _ went to third on a ground out and scored on another
grounder. It was a manufactured run, vintage Henderson. He later
drew two walks and singled again.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Mets trailing by 8-7 in the seventh, John Vander
Wal of the Pirates sliced a high fly down the left field line.
Henderson gave chase as if he could make the catch, then stopped as
the ball landed a few feet in front of him and bounced over his
head, into the Mets bullpen. Two runs scored and the Pirates
widened their lead to 10-7.
</P>
<P>
   That was the fourth hitter the reliever Pat Mahomes faced, and
the fourth hit he surrendered. The fifth came one batter later,
when Luis Sojo drove in another run with a single. Mahomes had
relieved Dennis Cook, who allowed a single and hit a batter to
start the seventh. In all, seven Pirates reached base and five
scored before Rich Rodriguez came in and got three outs in a row.
</P>
<P>
   That inning wiped out a rally in the top of the inning that had
given the Mets a 7-6 lead. Mike Piazza and Robin Ventura singled
with one out _ the two had hit consecutive home runs earlier _ and
Todd Zeile stroked a run-scoring double to left, his first hit in
19 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   But with runners at second and third, Manager Bobby Valentine
called for a suicide squeeze, and Melvin Mora missed on the bunt
attempt against Jose Silva's first-pitch curveball. Ventura was
trapped and thrown out at third, and after Mora was walked
intentionally, the light-hitting Rey Ordonez struck out to end the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   That rally was cut short, but in the third inning the Mets had
sustained their rally, off the Pirates' starter, Todd Ritchie.
Ritchie, a right-hander, had been solid this year, going at least
six innings while allowing three earned runs or fewer in each of
his six starts. But he was not sharp, hitting Reed in the third and
then walking Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   With two out, Edgardo Alfonzo doubled to right-center, scoring
two runs, and Piazza followed with a two-run homer deep into the
seats in left-center. With a 2-0 count, the next hitter, Ventura,
pounded a homer to right, giving the Mets consecutive homers for
the second game in a row, and a 6-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, a five-run lead is safe with Reed, who went 3-0 in
April. But he lost a one-run lead against the Giants in San
Francisco in his last start, and the Pirates pulled to within 6-3
through five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Young, who had four hits including a homer, opened the
sixth with a single. Reed then fell behind Wil Cordero, 2 and 0,
and Cordero crushed the next pitch into the upper deck in left
field, the third of his five hits. That brought Pittsburgh within
6-5, and Turk Wendell relieved Reed after Pat Meares singled.
</P>
<P>
   Wendell had allowed only one inherited runner to score this
year, and he got two quick outs. But Adrian Brown lofted a fly to
center that sent Mora racing back _ then, suddenly, shifting
directions to move sideways and in. On the misplay, Mora trapped
the ball off the AstroTurf, Meares scored the tying run, and Brown
had a double.
</P>
<P>
   Cook came in and struck out Warren Morris to end the inning.

<P>
   Public safety officials ordered everyone out of Los Alamos,
N.M., Wednesday as intensifying winds sent a week-old fire into the
town of 11,000. But officials at the Los Alamos National Laboratory
said they were confident that the nuclear material and chemical
explosives were protected, even if the laboratory itself started
burning.
</P>
<P>
   Police, sheriff's and fire department officials went door to
door urging people to pack up and get out as quickly as possible.
No injuries were reported, but about 200 homes were near the fire
or already burning early Wednesday evening. The fire command post
itself was forced to leave.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton declared Los Alamos a disaster area.
</P>
<P>
   A plume of smoke 17,000 to 20,000 feet high was covering all of
northern New Mexico and moving east into Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be in Houston by tomorrow,'' said Jim Paxon, a fire
spokesman with the U.S. Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fire blew up, basically,'' Paxon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not safe and there are constant winds,'' he said, `` so
all air operations have been grounded and all hand crews have
pulled back into safe zones.'' He said crews could not fight the
blaze at the line of fire, but will continue to work on its
periphery.
</P>
<P>
   The fire is ``pretty close to the lab, and it may be on it right
now,'' Paxon said Wednesday afternoon, but the fire remained
several miles from the laboratory's main buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Wind gusts up to 41 miles per hour pushed the fire to the east
and southeast, toward the town of the laboratory. Winds were
expected to die down somewhat overnight, then kick up to 50 miles
per hour Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bad fire,'' said Jim Danneskiold, a Los Alamos
laboratory spokesman. ``The wind situation is not good.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire, called the Cerro Grande fire after the mountain where
it started, was set a week ago by the National Park Service in the
northwest corner of Bandelier National Monument to clear brush, but
flared out of control over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Fire is always a worry in the dry pine forests that surround the
town of Los Alamos and Los Alamos National Laboratory, whose
thousands of buildings _ most modern, but a few wooden structures
that date to the Manhattan Project of the 1940s _ occupy 43 square
miles of canyons and mesas. In 1977, the La Mesa fire burned part
of the laboratory grounds, and a 1996 fire, accidentally ignited by
campers, devastated some 15,000 acres of nearby forest.
</P>
<P>
   A main area of public concern was Technical Area 55, where the
laboratory keeps most of its nuclear materials. The surrounding
area was virtually free of trees and other burnable fuel,
Danneskiold said, and was about five or six miles from the nearest
firefighting line, and even further from any blaze.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also a building built to nuclear standards, virtually
bomb proof,'' he said. ``It supposedly can survive earthquakes,
huge fires, airplane crashes and disasters in general.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there have been no intact nuclear weapons at the
laboratory for 15 years. Non-nuclear explosives are stored in
concrete bunkers buried under a couple feet of earth. ``We're
pretty confident in those bunkers,'' Danneskiold said. ``The La
Mesa fire burned over the same bunkers and nothing happened.''
</P>
<P>
   But the outlook was critical for the town itself, where
residents continued to stream out Wednesday night. The western end
of town, evacuated initially Sunday, included 500 homes. A northern
section evacuated Wednesday moments before the blowup also
contained 500 homes, firefighters said.
</P>
<P>
   In Santa Fe, upscale hotels where rooms often cost $300 a night,
were offering evacuees rooms for $25.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Siegfried Hecker, a former director at the Los Alamos
Laboratory who now leads Russian cooperative studies there, was
packing his car late Wednesday to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it's serious for the town,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about the people, but I think we have everything
else in good shape. At this point, the lab looks in good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Concerned Citizens for Nuclear Safety, an
environmental group in Santa Fe, worried that toxic and radioactive
fumes could be released into the air if the fire spread to drums of
waste stored at the laboratory. ``We are concerned the lab is not
fully knowledgeable of what is in each drum,'' said Suzanne
Westerly, the group's acting executive director.
</P>
<P>
   She also said that plants around the laboratory have absorbed
radioctive contaminants over the years, which are now being
released into the air as the plants burn.
</P>
<P>
   But Danneskiold said that the laboratory continually monitored
the air around it and ``there was no evidence of airborne
contamination'' after the last major fire, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The laboratory's radioactive-contaminated waste is stored on a
barren area eight to nine miles from the from the fire, Danneskiold
said. ``There's no vegetation in the area to burn.''
</P>
<P>
   Danneskiold said that while the laboratory has been closed
because of the fire since Monday, power was on at the labs, and
guards and emergency personnel remained on duty. Security in
top-secret areas was being maintained, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that there was an old lab dump site known as
Acid Canyon near a part of town that was evacuated on Sunday, but
said he had no idea of conditions there. He said environmental
restorations had removed from the canyon old wastes dating from the
1940s and 1950s.

ITS NOT ALL DAZZLE: MTV HAS A CONSCIENCE, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., May 14)

 By JOSEPH HOOPER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since its founding in 1981, MTV has gotten plenty of mileage out
of young people's fantasies about sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. But
if the staple of the channel's programming, the music video, often
conveys an unbridled hedonism, the channel's documentary programs
can be regarded as the proverbial dropping of the other shoe.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, MTV's ``True Life'' documentary series takes its
audience to some pretty rugged places, including two public
restrooms. On ``I'm on Crystal Meth,'' which was first broadcast in
February, the MTV reporter Serena Altschul keeps up a concerned
patter as Amber, 19, shoots methamphetamine into a vein. Two years
ago, on ``Fatal Dose,'' about a heroin epidemic in Plano, Tex.,
Altschul shared the facilities with two affluent addicts, Allen,
19, and Eric, 22, who was painfully struggling to find an
injectable vein. ``If anybody still has any doubts,'' said Allen,
taking over the narration of this cautionary tale about heroin,
``Eric is proof as to whether it's really glamorous.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, producers working mostly out of MTV's corporate
offices in Times Square will make from 50 to 75 television
documentaries. Many will be about music or the music business _
subjects that account for most of the channel's programming. But
roughly a third of the documentaries tackle social problems that
affect younger people: drug addiction, school violence, sexually
transmitted disease. (Next on the schedule, on May 22, is ``Gun
Fight,'' on the politics of gun control, part of the network's
``Choose or Lose'' documentary series about young people and
political involvement.) But unless you happen to fall within the
channel's 18-to-24 ``core demographic,'' this is probably news to
you. In the minds of older television viewers, MTV's involvement in
documentary filmmaking about nonmusicians begins and ends with
``Real World.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past eight years, that MTV series has offered its
audience what amounts to a hugely popular lab experiment in which
successive sets of seven college-age kids live together for a
television season under the constant surveillance of a resident
film crew. ``Every year we ask, `When are we replacing it?''' said
Judy McGrath, president of the MTV network. ``But you can't beat it
to death.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Real World'' bills itself as ``a real-life soap opera'' and
producers at MTV's News and Docs division are quick to point out
that they have nothing to do with it. ``Even in the documentary
film world,'' said Lauren Lazin, the vice president for news and
documentaries, ``I've had people discount our department because
they think it's just `Real World.' That's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   At MTV, reality is a concept that's parsed very fine. ``Real
World'' and ``True Life'' both make their differing claims on it.
Then there is Tom Green, of the outrageous ``Tom Green Show.'' A
one-man lab experiment who regularly leaves the television studio
to assault real-life bystanders with his own twisted Andy
Kaufmanesque persona, Green won't be interviewing teen-age drug
addicts for a ``True Life'' documentary anytime soon. But he is
currently working on an episode of his own show about his recent
experiences with testicular cancer. ``It will definitely have a lot
of the elements of `True Life,''' Lazin allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The average adult might lose his balance in such a slippery
world. But according to Lazin, the younger generation, the most
media-saturated in history, doesn't have a problem. ``They get the
difference clearly,'' she said. For instance, the ``True Life''
episode first shown in August, ``I'm a Pro Wrestler,'' never
bothers to state the obvious, that professional wrestling is a
choreographed spectacle, not a competitive sport. Dave Sirulnick,
35, MTV's executive vice president of news and production, which
oversees News and Docs, said: ``For our audience, it would be like
saying, `Well, you know, an episode of ``Felicity'' is not true.'
It gets at the way young people watch it.'' McGrath, alluding to
the mix-and-match aesthetic of hip-hop music, sums up her network's
nonmusic programming this way: ``I look at it as the world remixed
by MTV.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last 14 years, Lazin has had the job of figuring out the
documentary portion of the mix. She came to the network with a
Stanford master's in film and her own well-received documentary
about young women in the 1920s, ``The Flapper Story,'' to her
credit; and her film peers were more than a little puzzled. ``The
attitude,'' Lazin said, ``was, `If you want to be a documentarian,
why aren't you at PBS?''' And even she admits that when she first
arrived at MTV, ``the word `documentary' probably sounded like
homework.''
</P>
<P>
   Her seemingly odd career choice paid off. In the intervening
years, Lazin noted, relatively cheap-to-produce documentaries on
cable channels like Discovery and Lifetime rushed in to fill the
programming needs of the cable universe. ``That created an audience
for reality filmmaking that I don't think was nearly there 20 years
ago,'' she said. In the meantime, MTV was growing from a fairly
small independent player in the television world into a crucial
member of the Viacom corporate family. ``Sometimes I feel like I
have my own independent film production company at this big
multinational entertainment conglomerate,'' she said, though her
personal style is more bohemian than corporate.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE)  &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Lazin does not completely disown the influence of ``Real World''
on her documentary division. ``On the pro side,'' she said, ``it
has really groomed an audience to appreciate real-life drama. I
think viewers get that real life can be as engrossing and engaging
and challenging, as entertaining as actors and actresses and sets
and make-up and costumes and all the artifices of narrative
storytelling.''

   After the third season of ``Real World,'' in 1994, the
HIV-positive Pedro Zamora died, occasioning an outpouring of grief
from the small televised circle of his San Francisco housemates and
from the larger circle of 1.3 million young viewers. ``That to me
was a wake-up call that our audience cared deeply about this
disease,'' Lazin said.
</P>
<P>
   If the robust documentary culture at MTV has drawn a measure of
inspiration from ``Real World,'' it is also attuned to the real
real world. Sirulnick's news department aggressively covers stories
that involve youth culture or the music industry or both. Coverage
of the 1990 Florida obscenity trial of 2 Live Crew grew into the
1994 documentary ``Gangsta Rap,'' exploring censorship and rap.
Coverage of the 1998 case of Matthew Shepard, murdered in Wyoming
for being gay, led to the Emmy-nominated ``True Life: Matthew's
Murder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The great moments have come back and forth,'' Sirulnick said,
``between the daily news organization covering something right now
and the longer documentary analysis.'' In the case of the Columbine
school shootings, MTV was, sadly, ahead of the curve, having just
completed work on a documentary that addressed earlier high-profile
school shootings. After the body count came in from Colorado,
``Warning Signs'' was rushed to air.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were amazed,'' Lazin said. `` `How did you know? How
did you get this?' It was like, `That's what we do.' We're in the
business of taking that pulse.'' Last year, MTV's ``Fight For Your
Rights'' campaign, which included ``Warning Signs,'' won a special
Emmy.
</P>
<P>
   Lazin is pushing the channel to explore quieter, artier avenues
in the documentary film world. This kind of film is represented by
``The Travelers,'' which was shown for the first time on April 19
(the channel regularly rebroadcasts its documentaries), concluding
the current season of ``True Life.'' Shot in black-and-white with a
cinema-verite sensibility, ``The Travelers'' tells the story of
teen-age hobos entirely in their own words. Only gradually, in
accordance with the languid, folk rhythm of the film, does the
desperate nature of the traveling enterprise become apparent. On
the evidence presented, hard-core travelers either quit the life
or, in travelers lingo, wind up as ``dead frogs.'' ``A lot of
`Travelers' is very traditional storytelling,'' Lazin said.
``Filmmakers don't have to come in with this bag of tricks of what
they think MTV wants.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oscar-nominated filmmaker Liz Garbus made ``The Travelers.''
And if Lazin has her way, Garbus will be only one of many
established artists to take advantage of MTV's documentarian safe
haven. ``I would love to do a documentary with D.A. Pennebaker or
Barbara Kopple,'' Lazin said, referring to two stars of nonfiction
film. ``I don't think you have to be 24 to make a film about
24-year-olds.'' Lazin herself harbors ambitions of taking
documentary films (including her own) into theaters, to be
distributed by the MTV Films division responsible for ``Election''
and ``Varsity Blues.''
</P>
<P>
   If ``The Travelers'' represents one future for documentaries at
MTV, the present seems to belong to Serena Altschul, the
29-year-old ``True Life'' reporter-producer who wades through the
carnage of youth culture with the swagger of a seasoned war
correspondent. On a recent ``True Life'' episode, ``I'm a Hacker,''
when Altschul is told that a particular teen-age computer hacker
has an attitude problem, she replies in her best Lauren Bacall
voice: ``That's OK I have an attitude problem too.'' Sirulnick
said, ``When you see our show, you know it's not the way ABC would
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Altschul's aggressively hip persona and MTV's relentless
focus on young people's stories can add up to unusual television.
``People are like, `Come to our party, we're all going to be
sniffing heroin here,''' Lazin said. For the ``Fatal Dose''
documentary, Altschul left a teen-age heroin party to get in a car
driven by one of her obviously addled teen-age subjects. ``Serena's
up with every bit of it,'' Sirulnick said, ``whereas with Stone
Phillips or whoever, it would be, `How's school, junior?'''
</P>
<P>
   For those not of the MTV generation, the whole notion of
fearless MTV documentaries takes some getting used to. In the
middle of ``I'm on Crystal Meth,'' Altschul asks Sheriff Joe Arpao
for the lowdown on crystal meth use in Maricopa County, Arizona. He
takes a close look at her and her punkishly short blond hair and
wonders aloud: ``MTV, what is that, a music station? You want me to
sing?''

WOMAN WHO KILLED HER BABY RETURNS HOME FROM PRISON  
 BY ROBERT HANLEY  
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WYCKOFF, N.J. _ Asking for privacy, a young woman returned to
her parents' suburban home Wednesday after serving 22 months in
prison for manslaughter in the widely publicized death of her
newborn son.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike her former boyfriend, who publicly expressed his sorrow
after he was freed from prison in January, the woman, Amy
Grossberg, referred only obliquely to the death of her child in a
Delaware motel in November 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, I am still reflecting on the past, but I am also
looking forward to the obligations and opportunities that lie
ahead,'' she said in a hand-written statement that a family lawyer,
Robert Gottlieb, read to reporters. She also said she was thankful
to be reunited with family and friends and was grateful for the
support she had received.
</P>
<P>
   Grossberg and her parents had planned to speak at an afternoon
news conference near their condominium, the Wyckoff police said
Wednesday morning. But the family changed their minds shortly after
arriving about noon from Delaware and did not appear.
</P>
<P>
   After reading the two-sentence statement, Gottlieb added only
that Grossberg hoped to continue her college education.
</P>
<P>
   After her former high school sweetheart and the infant's father,
Brian Peterson, 21, returned to his mother's home here four months
ago, he spoke at a news conference and said he was sorry for his
role in what he called the tragic events of November 1996.
</P>
<P>
   After Grossberg gave birth Nov. 12 in a motel near the
University of Delaware, Peterson put the infant in a plastic bag
and left him in a trash bin. Grossberg collapsed hours later in her
dorm. Shortly afterward, the police found the baby's body, and an
autopsy determined that he had died of a fractured skull.
</P>
<P>
   The case attracted national attention, partly because of
Peterson's and Grossberg's affluent suburban upbringing and partly
because Delaware prosecutors initially talked of seeking the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   During pretrial hearings in early 1998, Grossberg's lawyers
argued that Peterson acted alone in discarding the baby. His
lawyers responded that she had told him to ``get rid of'' the
infant. Then, in a plea deal, Peterson gave the authorities a
statement about the birth, agreed to testify against Grossberg, and
was allowed to plead guilty to manslaughter. Soon afterward,
Grossberg also pleaded guilty to manslaughter. Both said they
thought the baby was born dead.
</P>
<P>
   Grossberg's 30-month prison sentence was reduced to 22 months.
She must now serve two years on parole and do 300 hours of
community service counseling young, unmarried women who are
pregnant. Peterson is also on two years parole and is working in
his family's video business and counseling troubled teen-age boys
to tell their parents and outside experts about personal problems,
said his lawyer, Russell M. Gioiella.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced on Wednesday that he
was separating from his wife, Donna Hanover. He said that as he
battles prostate cancer he will need Judith Nathan, the woman he
describes as a ``very good'' friend, ``more now than maybe I did
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani did not say whether he would continue his race for the
U.S. Senate against Hillary Rodham Clinton, but he did say that his
political career was not at the moment his first concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really care about politics right now,'' Giuliani said.
``I'm thinking about my family, the people that I love and what can
be done that's honest and truthful and that protects them the best.
I'm not thinking about politics. Politics comes at least second,
maybe third, maybe fourth, somewhere else. It'll all work itself
out some way politically.''
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinary news conference in Bryant Park, Giuliani
spoke at length to reporters about his relationships with his wife
and Nathan. He spoke in a soft voice with downcast eyes as he
tightly gripped both sides of the lectern. The mayor described his
emotional state as ``sad'' and then added, ``I feel terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Three hours later, Hanover appeared outside the gates of Gracie
Mansion and, with a wavering voice and tears in her eyes, said:
``Today's turn of events brings me great sadness. I had hoped to
keep this marriage together. For several years, it was difficult to
participate in Rudy's public life because of his relationship with
one staff member.''
</P>
<P>
   Joannie Danielides, Hanover's press secretary, said that Hanover
was referring to Cristyne F. Lategano, Giuliani's former
communications director who is now president of NYC &AMP; Company, the
city's tourism bureau. Friends of Hanover said on Wednesday that
she had described the relationship between her husband and Lategano
as ``intimate'' while Lategano worked at City Hall. The mayor has
denied having had a romantic relationship with Lategano, who left
City Hall last May and married Nicholas Nicholas, a sports writer,
in February.
</P>
<P>
   Hanover also said that ``beginning last May, I made a major
effort to bring us back together. Rudy and I re-established some of
our personal intimacy through the fall. At that point, he chose
another path. Rudy and I will now discuss the possibility of a
legal separation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanover added that she and the couple's children, Andrew, 14,
and Caroline, 10, will continue to live at Gracie Mansion, the
mayor's official residence, ``for at least the next few months''
because of security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Lategano issued this statement on Wednesday: ``I have no desire
to speculate why Donna Hanover decided to issue the statement that
she did. Understandably, this is a difficult time. I wish both the
mayor and Donna Hanover a successful resolution.'' Lategano added
that she was ``proud'' to have worked for Giuliani, and that he
``is and will continue to be one of the greatest mayors in our
city's history.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After attending a fund-raiser at a private home in the
Westchester County town of Pelham Wednesday night, the mayor smiled
and showed off a blue and orange baseball jacket with the word
Pelham written on the front. But he had no reaction to the
statements of his wife. ``I am not going to react to it,'' he said.
``I said all I am going to say on that earlier today, this is all
very painful.''
</P>
<P>
   He also brushed aside questions about whether he was close to
withdrawing from the race, reiterating that he would make a
decision based on his medical treatments. He added that he had been
buoyed again by sympathetic New Yorkers. ``I have lots of people
supporting me, lots of people who help me and I hope to give some
of that back.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Hanover said that although she and her husband had
talked in recent days about ending their 16-year marriage, Hanover
did not know that Giuliani was going to announce their planned
separation at his news conference. Friends said she learned of her
husband's remarks immediately after the conclusion of the news
conference, which was held on the outdoor balcony of The Bryant
Park Grill in midtown Manhattan. The friends described Hanover as
``distraught.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Giuliani's senior advisers said on Wednesday that the
mayor's announcement caught them by surprise, too, even though
Giuliani had made no secret of his estrangement from his wife over
the past few years and had announced last week that Nathan, 45, a
divorced mother and registered nurse who works for a pharmaceutical
company, was a ``very good friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Pictures of Giuliani and Nathan leaving a restaurant together
were first published on May 3 by The New York Post. Giuliani
announced that he had prostate cancer in an early, treatable form
on April 27.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether Giuliani had planned beforehand to
announce the possible separation at the news conference, or whether
he wandered into the remarks as reporters questioned him. Since the
mayor learned he has prostate cancer, he has become increasingly
personal and introspective in his news briefings.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday Giuliani had no official statement, and only began
to talk about his marriage after a reporter asked him for a
reaction to comments made on Tuesday by Joseph Bruno, the state
Senate majority leader. In a radio interview in Albany, Bruno urged
Giuliani to resolve his differences with Hanover.
</P>
<P>
   She first publicly addressed the issue in a hastily arranged
news conference outside St. Patrick's Cathedral last weekend,
saying that her husband and her marriage ``have been very precious
to me.'' Bruno added that he was concerned that Giuliani's personal
life would distract him from the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   In responding to the question about Bruno, Giuliani never did
say what he thought of the majority leader's remarks. Instead, he
said: ``This is very, very painful. For quite some time it's
probably been apparent that Donna and I lead in many ways
independent and separate lives. It's been a very painful road and
I'm hopeful that we'll be able to formalize that in an agreement
that protects our children, gives them all the security and all the
protection they deserve, and protects Donna.''
</P>
<P>
   When pressed by reporters about whether he meant a legal
separation, the mayor at first said he did not want to give
details. But when asked if his wife would move out of Gracie
Mansion, Giuliani at last used the word ``separation'' by
responding haltingly: ``Nobody, nobody, nobody is moving anywhere.
Everybody is secure and safe. What I said is that we should try to
work out a separation agreement. That's different.''
</P>
<P>
   The marriage is Giuliani's second. His first marriage ended in
divorce and was annulled.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There were only a small group of reporters and television
cameras present in a small space, and many were only a few feet
from the mayor. As Giuliani continued to talk at length about his
relationships with the two women, the briefing became an unusually
intimate confessional for a man who has until recently guarded most
aspects of his private life. At one point, Giuliani was asked if
the media had caused the damage in his public life.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' responded Giuliani, who has often blamed the media in
the past. ``The media makes the damage worse, it didn't cause the
damage. I take responsibility for everything that I've done. And
you have a right to ask me and then I have a right to answer or not
answer. And that's the way I think we can have a respectful
relationship with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani also spoke warmly of both Nathan and Hanover. ``Judith
_ Judith Nathan is a very, very fine person,'' the mayor said.
``She's been a very good friend to me, before I had to deal with
the decisions that I have to make about my illness and what to do
about it, and I rely on her, and she helps me a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he turned his comments to his wife. ``Donna Hanover is a
wonderful woman,'' Giuliani said. ``And she's a wonderful mother.
She's someone that I respect tremendously. The fact that we've
grown independent, we've grown more separate over the years, who
knows why those things happen? But she is a very, very fine,
wonderful person, and she's an extraordinary mother and I have
tremendous respect for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what his emotional state was at that moment, Giuliani
responded: ``My emotional state is I'm very sad. And I feel
terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Physically, Giuliani, 55, has said he feels healthy, and has
kept a vigorous schedule with appearances around the city and three
trips upstate over the past two weeks. But he has also spent much
of his time meeting with doctors to determine his cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
   His acknowledgment of Nathan as a good friend came as his
illness was generating much public sympathy. Even so, recent polls
show that Clinton is still running ahead of Giuliani statewide, and
that the mayor did not get what pollsters call a ``bump'' in
support after his announcement of his illness.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani concluded his comments about his turbulent personal
life by saying that it had not affected the job he was doing as
mayor. ``It's a job that I love,'' Giuliani said. ``I love the
people of the city of New York. Some of them love me and some of
them hate me, but I think they all have a reaction to me.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The job is not affected at all by this, and never
will be.''

WILLIAM BOYLE, 88, CREDIT CARD PIONEER 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL SWEENEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   William J. Boyle, a banker who played a major role in devising
the first bank-issued credit card _ a forerunner of Visa and
Mastercard _ died April 30. He was 88 and lived in Garden City,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle developed the Franklin Charge Account Plan, which charged
interest and let customers make partial payments each month, in
1951 at the Franklin National Bank in Rockville Centre, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   It was a novel plan for a bank. At the time, charge plans were
limited largely to big New York department stores with suburban
branches. Moreover, as Boyle once noted, ``banks did not lend money
to the average fellow.'' Banks typically required borrowers to file
an application with two co-signatures for loans of less than $500.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, Diners Club introduced the first charge card _ meaning
that balances had to be paid in full. But Franklin's plan, which
used the marketing slogan ``Just charge it,'' was the first credit
card.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bank credit card is probably the most important and
enduring legacy of Franklin National Bank, which was one of the key
institutions in creating the culture of postwar consumerism,'' said
Stephan Salisbury, a cultural affairs reporter at The Philadelphia
Inquirer who has studied the role of Franklin National Bank in
bankrolling the rise of the Long Island suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Franklin Charge Card began in 1951 as a method of handling
fuel oil dealers' credit and collections.
</P>
<P>
   By October the following year, however, the program had expanded
to 750 merchants serving 28,000 customers, with annual charges
growing to $2.5 million annually. The First National Bank of
Kalamazoo in Michigan was the second bank to offer the service,
licensing the charge account plan from Franklin in 1952 and signing
up 30 merchants and 18,000 customers in its first three weeks of
operation. Banks in Rochester and Plainfield, N.J., soon followed
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Franklin credit card plan, the bank took over the
duties that were once the preserve of a department store's back
office. It approved the creditworthiness of borrowers while
handling the accounting, bookkeeping, billing and other paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   In return, participating merchants paid the bank a small fee for
the service and agreed to abide by a fair practices code that
required the merchant to take back all returns and offer a full
refund of the purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   The card was immediately popular with hardware dealers,
clothiers and specialty stores in Nassau County, N.Y., who began
directing their customers to apply for the credit cards at the
bank. The American Banker, the industry trade newspaper, said in
October 1952 that the Franklin Charge Account Plan was allying the
merchant and banker in the same way that car dealers and finance
companies became allies in the 1920s and 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Brooklyn in 1911, Boyle left St. John's University to
support his family by selling, among other things, hair tonic door
to door. In 1941, he enlisted in the Army, where he served as an
intelligence officer and rose to the rank of captain.
</P>
<P>
   By 1953, Boyle was in demand by the country's bankers who wanted
to copy the Franklin Charge Card. He left Franklin National and
began his own credit card consulting firm, but ran into legal
battles with his former employer and gave up the effort. (Franklin
was later acquired by European American Bank, which is now owned by
ABN Amro of the Netherlands.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1956 Boyle founded Eastern National Bank in Smithtown, N.Y.,
the first national bank in Suffolk County, and served as chairman
and president for 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   At Eastern National, Boyle inaugurated the ``golden passbook,''
a program in which the bank issued higher-yielding certificates of
deposit, paying 6 percent interest in the 1950s, when banks
typically paid 1 to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   After the bank's sale to Chemical Bank in 1972, Boyle worked as
a stockbroker for a short time before retiring.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle is survived by his wife, Sheila; five sons, William Jr.,
Arthur and John, all of Garden City; Joseph of North Massapequa,
N.Y., and Timothy of Coram, N.Y.; three daughters, Virginia
Satkowski, of Katonah, N.Y.; Therese Coughlin, of Basking Ridge,
N.J.; and Patricia Antonelle, of White Plains; and 13
grandchildren.

HILL IN NO MOOD TO TALK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Pitcher Ken Hill had not yet gone to the doctor for
an MRI, but he was in no mood to talk about his latest injury,
waving off a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Results of Wednesday night's MRI won't be available until today,
but Hill initially has been diagnosed with a strained intercostal
muscle, which is located in the upper ribcage below his right
armpit. Hill (3-4, 7.41 ERA) fell to his knees in pain after making
a pitch in the third inning Tuesday night, was taken out of the
game and placed on the 15-day disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems 15 days won't be enough to heal the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it's a great concern of ours,'' manager Mike
Scioscia said. ``When you're talking about a torso injury with a
pitcher, it's as devastating as an arm injury. It's safe to say
it's going to be a while, more than two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have been careful with Hill all season because of an
arthritic right elbow, but his elbow is fine.
</P>
<P>
   Losing Hill from the rotation isn't the only pitching change for
the club. Ramon Ortiz, struggling at 2-2 with a 6.90 ERA, was
optioned to Triple-A Edmonton and replaced by left-hander Jarrod
Washburn.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Washburn had an injury similar to Hill's both last
season and in spring training this year, though Washburn's strain
was below the ribcage. Washburn missed seven weeks last season, but
just three weeks this year before reporting to Edmonton, where he
went 3-0 with a 3.52 ERA in five starts.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn will start Saturday's game against the Rangers in
Ortiz's spot. Hill's spot in the rotation comes up Sunday, when the
Angels are expected to activate Jason Dickson (strained hip) from
the DL to start that game against the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   As for the highly-touted Ortiz, the move could be seen coming
weeks ago because of his inconsistency, and not because of the
small tear in the cartilage of his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ramon has the potential to be a premier pitcher in this
league,'' Scioscia said. ``We wracked out brains and talked about
it, but we think this is the best course to take.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nobody in the world who would feel good about going
back to the minor leagues. But Ramon absolutely understands what he
has to work on to reach his potential. He's the first guy to say he
has not been pitching well. ... Here's a guy trying to throw 98 mph
when he throws 92-94 mph. He gets out of whack and loses command.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I don't feel good but I understand what I need to
do,'' Ortiz said through Preston Gomez, the Angels' assistant to
the GM. ``I'm not surprised. I understand it's part of the
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Gary DiSarcina had an MRI on his ailing right shoulder
Tuesday night, but results were not released by the Angels. In past
instances regarding a delayed announcement, the results many times

PEREZ TO RETAIN ROTATION SPOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Two weeks ago, left-handed pitcher Carlos Perez was
destined for the minors, but an agreement between him and the
Dodgers bought him more time. Now, he is arguably pitching better
than anyone else in the rotation, other than Kevin Brown, and won't
be the starter bumped because of offdays on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, rookie right-hander Eric Gagne will miss a turn in the
rotation while Perez pitches against the St. Louis Cardinals. It's
a move manager Davey Johnson thought about after watching Perez
pitch so well lately.
</P>
<P>
   If not for the bullpen blowing a three-run lead in the eighth
inning Tuesday, Perez would lead the Dodgers with four wins and be
sixth in the National League. Perez is the only Dodgers starter
other than Kevin Brown to go at least seven innings in more than
one start, throwing that many innings in back-to-back starts.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long way from where Perez was during a 2-10 record with a
7.43 ERA in 1999, not to mention where he was earlier this season.
After getting pounded in an April 7 start in Montreal, Perez was
sent to Triple-A Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   Perez allowed eight runs (five earned) and a pair of three-run
homers in 4 innings, and it seemed like nothing more than an
extension of last season.
</P>
<P>
   But then Brown broke his pinkie and the Dodgers were in a tough
spot, so they recalled Perez. He responded by going 3-0 with a 4.06
ERA in his next five starts and now has pushed Gagne to the back.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Dreifort will open the series Friday, Chan Ho Park
pitches Saturday and Perez ends the series Sunday. Perez is also
scheduled to start May 19 in the series opener in Florida, and
Gagne should return to the rotation May 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carlos has pitched better each time out,'' pitching coach
Claude Osteen said. ``You can see he has more confidence and he's
pitching better.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the decision to go with Perez against St. Louis is the
Cardinals' lineup, which can have a decided left-handed look. The
Cardinals are hitting .297 against right-handers and .268 against
left-handers.
</P>
<P>
   In typical rookie fashion, Gagne's been hit or miss. He's 0-2
with a 4.14 ERA. But he's failed to last five innings in two of his
five starts, and the Dodgers want Gagne to be more pitch efficient.
</P>
<P>
   Park and Kreuter: Apparently, Dodgers manager Davey Johnson saw
enough meltdowns with Todd Hundley catching Chan Ho Park, so now it
will be Chad Kreuter catching the right-hander almost exclusively.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson doesn't like to go with personal catchers, but the
statistics speak toward Park having success with Kreuter. In the
four starts Kreuter's made, Park's 2-2 with a 4.63 ERA. In the
three starts Hundley's made, Park is 1-1 with a 7.31 ERA, including
Monday's bombardment in which Park allowed eight runs in 3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Tests conducted on right-hander Gregg Olson's
right forearm didn't detect anything new, but he'll remain in Los
Angeles and have an MRI today in an attempt to figure out why he's
experiencing discomfort in his right forearm. Olson's been on the
15-day disabled list since April 11 (retroactive to April 9) with a
pinched nerve in his right forearm.... Lefty Jeff Williams, on the
disabled list with weakness in his pitching hand, was examined by
hand specialist Dr. Norman Zemel in Los Angeles and tests were
negative. Williams is slated to begin a throwing program soon....
Arizona lefty Randy Johnson's fourth-inning strikeout of Adrian
Beltre pushed him past Frank Tanana and into 15th all-time with
2,774.... Dodgers third baseman Adrian Beltre's throwing error in
the second inning was his team-leading 10th error. It snapped a
string of errorless innings for the Dodgers at 43, their longest of
the season.... Dodgers right fielder Shawn Green had hits in his
first two at-bats against Johnson, equaling the number of hits
Johnson allowed this season against lefties. They were 2 for 25
entering the game, with Colorado's Todd Helton and Chicago's Mark
Grace getting the hits.

UC, GRAD STUDENTS REACH LABOR DEAL
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MEREDITH MAY 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly 10,000 University of California graduate teaching
assistants are set to ratify their first contract, ending a 16-year
campaign for labor representation and a threat to strike during
this semester's finals.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year agreement, announced Wednesday, covers pay,
workload and sexual harassment policies for the assistant teachers
and tutors, who conduct an estimated 60 percent of the teaching on
the UC system's eight campuses with undergraduate programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ecstatic,'' said Christian Sweeney, a UC Berkeley
graduate student and president of the Association of Graduate
Student Employees, which is an affiliate of the United Auto Workers
union.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long, hard road, but we're finally there,'' said
Sweeney, adding that the contract should be ratified by teaching
assistants at all eight campuses within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   If the contract gets the green light, graduate teaching
assistants will notice immediate bumps in their salaries, which
average $13,800 for a nine-month, half-time gig.  &LR; job.
</P>
<P>
   Over three years, salaries will rise 7.5 percent. Teaching
assistants will receive an immediate 1.5 percent salary increase
and a proposed 2 percent raise this October and the following two
Octobers.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, their salaries were increased 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the cost of attending the University of California
will be waived for graduate student teachers by 2002. Teaching
assistants now are allowed to waive $2,175, or 60 percent of the
cost of attending the UC system. The rebate will increase to 75
percent this fall, 85 percent next fall and 100 percent by fall of
2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great contract, and we're happy to offer it,'' said
Brad Hayward, spokesman for the UC system.
</P>
<P>
   For 16 years, teaching assistants fought to unionize, facing
opposition from UC officials. They struck systemwide in December
1998, walking out for four days. Eventually, the state Public
Employment Relations Board ruled that students are entitled to
collective bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Association of Graduate Student Employees affiliated with
the UAW in the spring of 1999 to represent approximately 9,400
academic student employees at UC campuses.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted union negotiations with the UC system to hammer
out a contract. One of the final sticking points was how to handle
workload and sexual harassment policies between professor and
student.
</P>
<P>
   The graduate students wanted guarantees to keep workloads close
to the 20-hour-per-week standard, but the university wanted to keep
hours more flexible to allow professors to tailor their classes as
they see fit.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides agreed to bring in a neutral arbitrator if
disputes over workload or sexual harassment arise.
</P>
<P>
   On April 25, the two sides met with state Senate President Pro
Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, and Marty Morgenstern, a mediator
appointed by Gov. Gray Davis. They reached agreement on several
issues that had been holding up a contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``This campaign was really important, because while 20 other
universities in the country have union representation for teaching
assistants, UC becomes the largest,'' Sweeney said. ``It's a
bellwether for union organizing, and a lot of other campuses were
watching us to see what would happen before trying it themselves.''

C.A. SCOTT, 92, VOICE OF BLACKS AS PUBLISHER OF ATLANTA WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Ala., Miss.)   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cornelius Adolphus Scott, editor and publisher of The Atlanta
Daily World from 1934 until 1997 and a strong voice for the
interests of its black readers, died on Sunday at an Atlanta
hospital. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Widely known as C.A. Scott, he became head of The World, a
family business, on the death of his brother William Alexander
Scott II, who had founded The World in 1928 as a monthly.
</P>
<P>
   C.A. Scott was succeeded by M. Alexis Scott, granddaughter of
W.A. Scott II, as he was known.
</P>
<P>
   Among the newspaper's goals, as Scott recalled in 1978, was ``to
give constructive and inspiring news'' to blacks. Under him, The
World spoke in favor of voting rights for blacks and racial
integration of schools and businesses. His daughter Portia A.
Scott, a former editor of The World, recalled in an interview
Wednesday that her father's outspoken pro-civil-rights views did
not lead to any violence against him, although she said there might
have been threats in letters.
</P>
<P>
   Scott was chairman of the Public Affairs Committee of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People for a
time.
</P>
<P>
   A chain of Scott-owned papers included about 50 papers around
the country in the mid-1930s. But by 1970 all had closed except The
World and one in Birmingham, Ala., which the family later sold.
</P>
<P>
   After the victories of the civil rights movement in the 1960s,
many older black newspapers suffered sharp declines in circulation.
The World's circulation fell to 16,500 by the mid-1980s from 22,000
in the early 1960s. The World, which became a daily in 1932, is now
published twice a week, on Sunday and Thursday. Its circulation is
10,000, about the same as when Scott retired.
</P>
<P>
   Cornelius Adolphus Scott was born in Edwards, Miss., and studied
at Morehouse College in Atlanta and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, Scott, said that in 1952 her father switched from
supporting the Democratic Party to backing the Republican Party. He
saw the necessity of having both parties running candidates in the
South, she said, and he resented that the history of the Democratic
Party in the South had been anti-black.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Ruth, died in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his daughter, who lives in Atlanta, survivors
include a sister, Ruth Scott Simmons of Atlanta; four
grandchildren, and a great-grandson.

CALIFORNIA YOUTH AUTHORITY CHARGED WITH TREATING INMATES
AT  UNLICENSED MEDICAL FACILITIES
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By GREG LUCAS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Already under investigation for brutality against
inmates, the California Youth Authority is facing new charges that
its 7,300 inmates are being treated in unlicensed medical
facilities that do not meet state standards.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, expected to be filed Thursday in San Francisco,
seeks an order that the department get licenses for its medical and
mental health treatment centers which it has failed do since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't gotten licensed because they really can't,'' said
Susan Burrell, a lawyer with the Youth Law Center in San Francisco,
which prepared the lawsuit. ``They don't meet these standards in
any way, shape or form.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Ludeman, a spokeswoman for the Youth Authority,
acknowledged that none of the medical or mental health treatment
facilities are licensed by the state but said the authority has
``been working for some time to bring our sites into compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is the latest in a series of problems for the
authority.
</P>
<P>
   A probe last year that uncovered abuse and brutality by
correctional officers at one of the authority's 11 facilities led
to the resignation in December of Gov. Gray Davis' first appointee
to head the agency, Gregorio S. Zermeno, 10 months after being
named to the post.
</P>
<P>
   Two other top deputies also left the authority.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Davis named Jerry Harper, a 37-year veteran of the Los
Angeles Sheriff's Department, to head the authority. Next week he
will appear at a hearing of the Senate Public Safety Committee on
the authority. Committee chairman, Sen. John Vasconcellos, D-Santa
Clara, has been one of the authority's sharpest critics.
</P>
<P>
   After the investigation last year into prison guard brutality,
Davis called for an overhaul of department policies.
</P>
<P>
   The state Board of Corrections is conducting an audit and
investigation of the Youth Authority including visits to its
largest facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Among the things investigators are examining are the medical
care of inmates in general and the care for mentally ill inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Since January 1, 1996, medical facilities in prisons, jails and
the Youth Authority have been required to be licensed by the state
Department of Health Services.
</P>
<P>
   The department maintains a 40-page list of the minimum standards
for what are known as `'correctional treatment centers.''
</P>
<P>
   Those include the required staffing levels for doctors and
nurses, the proper use of clinical restraint and the giving of
drugs to inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The Youth Authority was been  &LR; told by Health Services that its
facilities needed to be licensed in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Youth Authority has sought more money to improve
its medical services but has yet to secure licenses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Youth Authority was told by Health Services that,
among other things, its Stockton facility's pharmacy services
failed to meet state standards and that there appeared to be not
enough nurses on duty nights and weekends.
</P>
<P>
   The authority was reminded again in December 1998 that its
treatment centers needed to be licensed.
</P>
<P>
   The authority has acknowledged some of its own treatment
problems.
</P>
<P>
   In a request for $1 million for the state's current fiscal year
to create a mental health treatment center at one of its
facilities, the authority said there were more wards needing mental
health care than available beds.
</P>
<P>
   ``While waiting for an available bed, the severely disabled
wards must be managed in general population units by staff who have
little or no training in delivering mental health treatment
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result, eligible offenders (for mental health treatment)
are often assigned to lock-up or high control housing units based
on their bizarre behaviors, poor reality contact and tendency to be
unreasonable,'' the authority wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The request for money said there were five suicides of authority
inmates in 1996. Of those, four ``were in serious need of mental
health treatment'' but not in a program.
</P>
<P>
   Its unclear whether the $1 million request was approved by Davis
although his budget for last year and this one make no mention of
it.
</P>
<P>
   A previous year's budget request sought eight pharmacists and
seven assistants because at those facilities which contract with
outside pharmacists, prescriptions are not available at night or
over weekends, making it impossible to get needed drugs in an
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Adding the pharmacists would help bring the Youyh Authority into
state licensing compliance, the request concluded.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1998 budget, Davis' predecessor, GOP Gov. Pete Wilson,
included the new pharmacists.

EDITORIAL: A WEAK BUT CRAFTY MICROSOFT RESPONSE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, May 11:
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft proposed a tactically shrewd but substantively shallow
remedy Wednesday for the antitrust violations that a federal court
found it had committed. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled last
month that Microsoft had violated the antitrust laws by using its
monopoly over Windows, the operating system that runs personal
computers, to block potential rivals. The government proposed two
weeks ago that the judge break Microsoft in two _ creating a
company that sells an operating system and a separate company to
sell word processors, browsers and other application programs.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's filing, Microsoft rebutted the judge's findings
that it did anything wrong and, in any case, rejected the
government's plan as disproportionate to the alleged violations.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft instead proposed constraints on its business
practices. It would, for example, let computer manufacturers delete
the icon for Microsoft's browser on the Windows screen that users
see the first time they turn their machines on, giving Netscape's
browser a better chance to attract customers. This proposal
addresses the judge's finding that Microsoft had illegally blocked
out the Netscape browser, which had the potential to develop into a
threat to Windows' control over the software industry.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also agreed to give computer manufacturers more
control over the software they make easily available to computer
users. The company is also willing to forgo some of the ways it
punishes manufacturers and Internet companies that side with
Microsoft's rivals.
</P>
<P>
   These conduct remedies are welcome, but they are so porous they
would still allow Microsoft to retaliate against companies that do
business with its rivals and to block those that try to sell
software that could challenge the Windows monopoly. Besides, the
conduct remedies would be difficult to enforce, requiring constant
government monitoring of the American software industry for years
to come.
</P>
<P>
   The remedies could, at best, prevent Microsoft from repeating
sins of the past. But they could not redress the fundamental harm
found by Jackson _ that Microsoft used its Windows monopoly to
thwart other operating systems from challenging Windows, thereby
dulling innovation throughout the software industry.
</P>
<P>
   The only remedy for that problem is to inject competition into
the software markets. The government plan would do that by putting
the new applications company into position to develop its own
operating system or to rewrite popular applications programs like
Word for non-Windows operating systems, giving them a shot at
attracting customers.
</P>
<P>
   However weak in substance, the Microsoft response is legally
crafty. Jackson may be wary of embracing the government's remedy
because the conservative judges on the appeals court might overturn
such a drastic solution. Microsoft gave the judge added incentive
to reject the government's structural remedy by threatening to tie
the case up for months, pushing it beyond the elections, when the
Democrats might no longer control the Justice Department. On the
other hand, Microsoft offered to wrap up the trial quickly if the
judge limited the penalty to conduct remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson need not put speed above substance. Microsoft committed
serious violations. Its half-hearted conduct remedies solve no
important problem. Breakup is the right solution, and the judge can
take all the time the parties need to come to the proper
resolution.

BROCKOVICH, BOSS TALKED OF MONEY FIRST, LAWYER SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID GREENBERG 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENTURA, Calif. _ The lawyer for Erin Brockovich's ex-husband on
Wednesday accused the recent movie subject and her lawyer-boss of
initiating the money talks that led to the arrest of his client and
two others on extortion charges.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn William Brown was simply discussing the negative portrayal
of him in the Julia Roberts blockbuster ``Erin Brockovich'' when
the real-life legal researcher and her boss, Ed Masry, brought
money into the discussion, the attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offers and conversations of what to say and not to say
started from the Brockovich-Masry camp,'' said defense attorney
Joel Isaacson, who stopped short of calling the April 26 arrest a
set-up.
</P>
<P>
   Brown ``felt like he wanted to respond to (the movie.) We feel
he has the right to do that. He wanted to tell the truth _ the way
he saw it occur,'' Isaacson said.
</P>
<P>
   Isaacson's remarks outside the Ventura County courthouse came
after lawyers for the three defendants delayed until June 19 their
arraignments on felony charges of conspiracy to commit blackmail
and attempted blackmail.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say Brown, 38, of Simi Valley, Jorg Lawrence Halaby,
46, of Costa Mesa and Century City attorney John Jeffrey Reiner,
53, threatened to portray the legal duo in an unflattering light if
the two did not pay them $310,000.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, they were going to tell the tabloid media that
Brockovich and Masry _ both married to others _ had an affair and
that Brockovich was a poor mother to her three children,
authorities said. Brown is the father of Brockovich's two older
children.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was to receive $280,000 while Halaby, an ex-boyfriend of
Brockovich's who is portrayed by actor Aaron Eckhart in the movie,
was to receive $30,000, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   But Isaacson said the April 26 meeting _ where money exchanged
hands under police surveillance _ took place on the advice of
Reiner.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Extortion) did not happen,'' Isaacson said. ``We think the
whole picture's got to be looked at.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Bob Calvert would not comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Brockovich, the 39-year-old director of research at Masry &AMP;
Vititoe, a Westlake Village law firm, was in New Orleans, and
through her assistant refused to comment on Isaacson's allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Masry, however, laughed off the claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would I initiate a talk to give Shawn money?'' he said.
``My mother may have raised an ugly child but she didn't raise a
stupid one. That's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   In the critically acclaimed movie, Roberts portrays Brockovich
as a down-on-her-luck, twice-divorced single mother of three, who
is hired as a file clerk by Masry (played by Albert Finney). She
becomes interested in a case in which residents of Hinkley, Calif.,
are suffering devastating illnesses because of a contaminated water
supply, and helps Masry's law firm win a record $333 million
judgment from the powerful utility Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is not depicted in the movie, although the title character
implies that he is a deadbeat father who was never around. But in
an interview following his arrest, Brown maintained that he has
always been a caring father to his son and daughter, who are now 16
and 15.

EDITORIAL: MOMS MARCHING FOR GUN CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, May 11:
</P>
<P>
   The Million Mom March taking place this Sunday in Washington and
some 60 other cities across the nation has the potential to achieve
something that a seemingly endless sequence of school shootings and
other gun tragedies somehow has not. That critical something is to
seize control of America's gun control debate from the National
Rifle Association and its political mouthpieces. The spectacle of
huge numbers of mothers organizing to protect their children is
something even the NRA will find hard to attack.
</P>
<P>
   By demonstrating that there is a large, identifiable grass-roots
constituency that supports sensible steps like full background
checks before all gun sales and a new national system of gun
licensing and registration, Sunday's event could help transform the
gun control argument _ tilting it away from an archaic fixation on
the rights of hunters and toward a recognition of the serious
public health threat the nation's porous gun laws represent. For
those frustrated by the failure of the political system to deliver
meaningful gun control legislation, it is hard to think of a better
way to spend Mother's Day.
</P>
<P>
   The march comes at a critical moment. The nation is in the midst
of a presidential election year in which gun control will surely be
an issue. On Capitol Hill, a worthwhile if modest package of gun
control measures remains bottled up in a House-Senate conference
committee _ providing grist for this fall's battle between the
Democrats and Republicans for control of Congress. Gun makers,
facing lawsuits brought by localities harmed by the irresponsible
design, marketing and distribution of their products, are under
pressure to join Smith &AMP; Wesson in agreeing to change the way they
do business _ a move they are still strongly resisting. Meanwhile
more than 80 Americans, including about a dozen children, continue
to die every day from gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   The march will focus on child safety and will involve hundreds
of thousands of mothers who also happen to be swing voters. It is
therefore certain to get politicians' attention. But whether it
will succeed in breaking through the ideological and partisan
barriers that stand in the way of gun control remains to be seen.
Obviously a lot depends on maintaining the event's nonpartisan
tenor and, afterward, its momentum. The women and men who
participate cannot abandon the battle after the day's protest is
over.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the march originated with Donna Dees-Thomases, a
New Jersey mother who says she was energized by the televised
images of terrified children being led from their day camp to
escape a gunman's shooting rampage in Granada Hills, Calif., last
August.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic of invoking the moral authority of mothers to gain
progress on a pressing social issue is not new. It worked
remarkably well for Mothers Against Drunk Driving, for example,
which played a big role in shifting attitudes on drinking and
driving. We suspect, and strongly hope, that mom power can work
similar magic for the gun control movement.

 PREDATORY BUG FOUND NEAR LODI HAS VINEYARDS ON ALERT  &HT;     By GLEN MARTIN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A voracious sap-sucking bug that infects grapevines with a
deadly bacterium has been found near Lodi, raising fears that the
pest could be homing in on the vineyards of Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of a glassy-winged sharpshooter in a trap on
Monday was the second find in San Joaquin County in less than a
year, and it made no one happy.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly inch-long insects have already hammered vineyards in
Riverside County, and they could do the same if they get into the
vineyards of San Joaquin County and the premium grapes of Napa and
Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   Glassy-winged sharpshooters first showed up in the state in
1989, probably imported on nursery stock from the American
Southeast or Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   They have since spread throughout most of the southern part of
the state and into the southern San Joaquin Valley. Although the
Monday discovery may be an isolated incident, agriculture experts
consider any sign of the insects in the northern San Joaquin Valley
ominous because it could mean that they are implacably expanding
their range.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have had a devastating impact on the wine industry in
Temecula,'' said Matthew Blua, a research associate in the
entomology department at the University of California at Riverside,
``and in all likelihood, they will probably establish themselves at
some time at some population level in the North Coast (counties of
Napa, Sonoma and Mendocino).''
</P>
<P>
   The sharpshooters are part of an invasion of ``exotic'' insect
pests that have bedeviled California during the past 25 years. Such
species include Mediterranean fruit flies, fire ants and killer
bees.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all of agricultural California has the two main things
the sharpshooters need to spread, said Blua _ host plants and
enough heat to allow two generations of bugs a year.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the sharpshooters that kill the vines. But by doing
what they do naturally _ feeding placidly on sap _ they transmit a
bacterium, Xyella fastidiosa, to their host plants.
</P>
<P>
   The bacterium causes Pierce's disease, which interferes with the
flow of nutrients throughout plant vascular tissue.
</P>
<P>
   There is no cure for Pierce's disease _ once a vine is infected,
its demise is certain.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce's disease was already a problem for the state's $33
billion wine industry before the glassy-winged sharpshooter first
showed up in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But at that time, the disease was primarily spread by the
blue-green sharpshooter, an arthropod decidedly smaller and less
robust than its glassy-winged cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Blue-green sharpshooters can only fly a few feet and subsist on
a limited number of plant species.
</P>
<P>
   Glassy-winged sharpshooters, on the other hand, can fly as far
as one-half mile and will suck sap from practically anything.
</P>
<P>
   The Davis administration is so concerned about the threat that
it recently committed $14 million over a two-year period to
fighting the bug.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Cooper, a spokesman for the California Department of Food
and Agriculture, said the sharpshooter found Monday probably
hitchhiked up from Southern California on nursery stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're investigating now and trying to trace it back to its
origin,'' said Cooper. ``It's probably an isolated individual _ we
don't think we're dealing with a (sizable) population, though we're
increasing our trapping in the area to be sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Northern California growers and vineyard managers are closely
monitoring the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned, but this (the San Joaquin Valley discovery)
isn't a total surprise,'' said Martin Mochizuki, the vice president
and director of viticulture for Walsh Vineyard Management in Napa
County, a firm that farms about 2,000 acres of vines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're watching the importation of nursery stock very closely
up here,'' said Mochizuki. ``And we don't think we have as much of
a problem as people do in the San Joaquin Valley, primarily because
we have very little citrus up here. Citrus appears to be an
important host plant for glassy-wings.''
</P>
<P>
   If the sharpshooters do get established in Northern California,
growers will probably increase pesticide spraying _ at least in the
short run. But that is not a desirable long-term solution, say
experts, because of both the economic and environmental expense.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the money cut loose by the state to fight sharpshooters
is going into research for long-term solutions, including vine
stock that is resistant to X. fastidiosa, micro-nutrients that may
inhibit the bacteria once they are in the plant, and insects that
prey on glassy-wings or their eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Mochizuki, who serves as chairman on a regional task force on
Pierce's disease, says the development of resistant vines looks
particularly promising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're also supporting a genome project for X. fastidiosa,'' he
said. ``By sequencing its entire genetic structure, we hope to find
some points where it's vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   The basic strategy, said Mochizuki, is to fight an effective
holding battle with the sharpshooter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can keep it out of here for 10 years or so, we're pretty
optimistic we'll have some effective tools for dealing with it,''
he said.  &LR;

 STATE HIGH COURT DENIES HEARING ON PROP. 21 CHALLENGE  &HT;     By STACY FINZ 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The state Supreme Court refused Wednesday to
hear a claim by the League of Women Voters and two children's
advocacy groups that challenged Proposition 21, a new law that
imposes stiffer penalties on juveniles who commit crimes.
</P>
<P>
   As is customary, the high court gave no reason for its decision
to deny review. The court also turned down the groups' request to
block the law, which went into effect April 9.
</P>
<P>
   The League of Women Voters, Children's Advocacy Institute and
Coleman Advocates for Children and Youth wanted the court to deem
the law unconstitutional because, they claimed, the proposition
illegally covered more than one subject and confused voters.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kim, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union who
is representing the three organizations, has said Proposition 21
improperly overhauled the juvenile and criminal justice system and
in the process amended two other laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a miscarriage of the electorate system that we would
like to stop,'' said Dorothy Ehrlich, the executive director of the
ACLU's Northern California office. ``We thought it was a case of
such state importance that we should start with the highest
court.''
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlich said Wednesday's decision does not bar them from filing
the challenge in a lower court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have to figure out what our next step is,'' she said.
``But this probably isn't the end.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposition known as the Gang Violence and Juvenile Crime
Prevention Act imposes tough new penalties on juvenile criminals
and increases penalties for gang-related crimes. It passed with 62
percent of the vote last November.
</P>
<P>
   The law was championed by former Gov. Pete Wilson and is part of
a longtime effort to reform the juvenile justice system. For years,
law enforcement and political leaders, victims' and children's
advocacy groups have debated over how to best deal with juvenile
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Critics call the measure draconian.
</P>
<P>
   The new law requires that anyone 14 years or older who commits a
violent sex crime or a special circumstance murder, including
killing multiple victims or slaying someone during a robbery, must
be tried and punished as an adult. California law, however,
precludes anyone younger than 18 from getting the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Proposition 21 gives prosecutors discretion to try
as adults minors who have committed other serious and violent
felonies. Previously, Juvenile Court judges made that decision
after conducting in-depth hearings into whether the child could be
rehabilitated in the juvenile system.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Keane, dean of Golden Gate University Law School and the
former second-in-command at San Francisco's public defenders
office, says it's unwise to take such sensitive decisions out of
the hands of judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``If prosecutors have discretion to be harsh or less harsh,
they're going to use the extreme measure allowed to them,'' Keane
said. ``That's just the nature of being a prosecutor. And no matter
how much judges are looking over their shoulders to the next
election, they'll want to follow their oath to mete out justice in
a fair and even manner.''
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Gaffey, a gang prosecutor in the Santa Clara County
District Attorney's office, the first to use the new law in the Bay
Area, said some juvenile criminals are more dangerous than others
and deserve to be treated accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are a number of kids who grow up very fast,'' he
said. ``If they're sophisticated enough to get their hands on guns
and kill someone, they should be treated severely.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaffey says that Proposition 21 puts several new laws on the
book that will help his office and other prosecutors around the
state combat a growing youth gang problem.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the measure now makes any gang-related murder a
capital crime. And it's now a felony to use or threaten violence to
coerce someone into joining or staying in a gang. Sentences range
from 16 months to five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The law also enables prosecutors to seek felony sentences in
gang-related graffiti cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us new tools that we didn't have before,'' Gaffey
said. ``We're hoping that it will have a detering effect.''

 LESS RELEVANT THAN A CEREAL BOX  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Love letters straight from your heart, keep us
so near while apart...
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Thanks for a column that is usually entertaining, though &LR; 
 &UR; sometimes tedious. (Ken Buhagiar) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This one is tedious already.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Why does this guy have a column? What an idiotic series &LR; 
 &UR; of meaningless crap. I've read cereal boxes that had more &LR; 
 &UR; relevance to my life. It sounds like a stupid man's cocktail &LR; 
 &UR; party conversation. Even when it seems he's onto an actual idea &LR; 
 &UR; or worthwhile commentary he doesn't follow through. Lose him. &LR; 
 &UR; (Dean Hughes) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Hi! What's your sign?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Please, someone write back to me because I am dying to &LR; 
 &UR; know. Did you go to a California Public School? I read your &LR; 
 &UR; column daily, and that is probably the average amount of times I &LR; 
 &UR; see an error. Daily. Grammatical, historical, political ... you &LR; 
 &UR; name it, you've done it. (Jenny Maher) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I make the mistakes other columnists are afraid to make. And for
the record, I did attend public school _ Mick Jagger High School in
Chowchilla.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; I am sorry to hear of your complete and total ignorance of the &LR; 
 &UR; laws of the United States. If you hate guns so much, why do you &LR; 
 &UR; live in a country that protects the right to keep and bear arms &LR; 
 &UR; for its citizens? Perhaps you should go elsewhere if you will &LR; 
 &UR; not support the Constitutional rights of Americans. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; With as little respect as possible, (Thane Bellomo) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly I see how wrong I've been. Your letter is so convincing
that I'm defecting immediately to Cuba or Russia, whichever one has
the most defects. Maybe Russia, where the bread is so good that
people stand in line for days to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, Thane, and good luck on your crusade to make nuclear
arms available to every street gang. God bless Charlton Heston, and
vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; May I suggest that if you are going to write about concrete &LR; 
 &UR; stairs or other concrete structures you learn the difference &LR; 
 &UR; between concrete and cement. Thank you, (Bob Poer) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; So teaching kids gun safety is bad, huh? Perhaps we should &LR; 
 &UR; eliminate driver ed., too. When will people like you ... (Matt &LR; 
 &UR; Bear) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Sorry to interrupt, Smokey, but there  &UR; are  &LR; no people like me.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BIG fan of yours. However the ol' column has been running a &LR; 
 &UR; leeeeetle flat lately in my humble opine. (Mark in Moraga) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   You think my column is flat, you should see my EKG. Falafel
City.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; I take nine prescription medicines a day, and they cause me to &LR; 
 &UR; read Carl Hiasson and yourself. (Kevin Enright Oatman) &LR;

<P>
   Read two George Wills and call me in the morning.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; Quite frequently, if you look too long at one of the ``full &LR;

 &UR; system of color reproduction. (Warren Dodge) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   What, you didn't get the 3-D glasses?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; I enjoyed your sports columns but it seems to me most of your &LR; 
 &UR; current columns are just mailed in so to speak. Plus I really &LR; 
 &UR; can't stand the smart-alecky expression on your face in the &LR; 
 &UR; picture. Other than that you're great. (Walt Denton) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It's a common misconception, Walt, that the photo with my column
is not a photo of me. For religious reasons I cannot allow myself
to be photographed. That photo is of a smart-alecky stunt double.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; You OK, Scott? (Howard Statham) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   No, but I'd rather look good than feel good.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The most important thing about your column is, you're not &LR; 
 &UR; funny. Have a beautiful day. (Anon.) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So you admit there's something important about my column!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Your snide remarks indicate to me that you are having some &LR; 
 &UR; difficulty in creating a newsworthy column. The (British &LR; 
 &UR; aircraft carrier) ``Invincible'' will probably outlive your &LR; 
 &UR; ``talents.'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   So will a ``scone.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; How about for your epitaph: ``For a good time, check out my &LR;

</P>
<P>
   Not bad, Susan, but I think I'm going to go with something
simple, maybe just the symbol for ``Recycle.'' Or, ``Born to be
wild, but got sidetracked.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; I've read my first and last Scott Ostler column and have come
to &LR; 
 &UR; the conclusion you are nothing more than a pseudo-intellectual &LR; 
 &UR; left-coast pinhead with limited talent and even less grace. &LR; 
 &UR; (Joseph Sneed) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   That's  &UR; Doctor  &LR; Ostler to you, pal.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; I have had it with this Scott Ostler. He is just not a good &LR; 
 &UR; writer. I am sorry to be so blunt but you need to find someone &LR; 
 &UR; with talent if you are going to feature a column like this on &LR; 
 &UR; the second page. It's just pathetic to keep this guy on life &LR; 
 &UR; support. Please, I respectfully request a mercy killing. Spare &LR; 
 &UR; us all and pull the plug! (Rosemary Garvey) &LR;

 CLINTON CLEARS WAY FOR LESS EXPENSIVE AIDS MEDICATION IN AFRICA  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton issued an executive order
Wednesday to make inexpensive drugs more available in AIDS-ravaged
Africa, rejecting a plea from pharmaceutical companies to protect
their profitable patents.
</P>
<P>
   The order would allow countries to produce or import generic
AIDS drugs, without fear of trade retaliation, in a region that
accounts for one-tenth of the world's population and more than 70
percent of its AIDS cases.
</P>
<P>
   The action came after an amendment containing nearly identical
language was stripped from a larger Africa trade bill that is
likely to pass Congress this week. California Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, author of the amendment, threatened to filibuster the
bill unless steps were taken to make affordable medication more
available.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein applauded the president's action during an emotional
speech on the Senate floor, in which she detailed the toll of AIDS
on Africa, where more people have been infected with HIV than
reside in the state of California.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we provide economic growth and opportunity to
sub-Saharan Africa if we ignore the fact that the region is facing
its worst catastrophe of this century?'' Feinstein said, tears
welling up.
</P>
<P>
   Pausing periodically to compose herself during a 90-minute
address, Feinstein recalled San Francisco's tribulations with AIDS
from her days as mayor and excoriated the drug companies for trying
``to squeeze every last drop of profit from the suffering of
millions of HIV/AIDS victims in sub-Saharan Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why, given that it represented a commonsense approach ... did
my amendment meet such stiff opposition?'' Feinstein wonderered
aloud, before placing the blame on drug company lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   ``After long and hard consideration, I have concluded that there
can be only one possible answer to that question _ profits and
corporate greed.''
</P>
<P>
   The high-stakes debate pits the need of poverty-stricken
Africans for drugs against the entrepreneurial rights of the
drugmakers who have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to
develop them.
</P>
<P>
   The president's order, which mirrors Feinstein's legislation,
states that the United States will not seek to overturn ``any
intellectual property law or policy'' imposed by a sub-Saharan
African government that promotes access to HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals
and medical technologies. In other words, a country that seeks to
produce or import a generic version of a patented AIDS drug will
not face trade sanctions from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the devastating impact of AIDS, the United States will
not require or negotiate restrictive rules in the intellectual
property rights area,'' said U.S. Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``This executive order is intended to help stop the spread of
HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa by making AIDS-related drugs and
medical technologies more accessible and affordable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Holmer, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America, criticized the executive order for
adopting a ``discriminatory approach to intellectual property
laws'' and focusing exclusively on pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that AIDS is a major problem,'' Holmer said in
comments quoted by the Associated Press. ``But weakening
intellectual property rights is not the solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein noted that the $1,000-a-month cost of AIDS treatment
in the United States is many times higher than the annual income of
many African victims, a problem she said is exacerbated by an
industry blindly driven by profits.
</P>
<P>
   She used the example of one drug, fluconazole, used to treat a
common fungal infection in HIV-positive people, which is available
as a generic drug in Thailand for $1.20 a day but sold in March for
$17.84 a day in Kenya and South Africa, where the only supplier is
Pfizer. (Pfizer however, she noted, has recently agreed to provide
free fluconazole to South Africa).
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply put, the pharmaceutical companies which manufacture HIV
/AIDS drugs would prefer to be able to sell drugs for $18 a dose
rather than $1 per dose, with the additional $17 going straight to
fattening the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from the pharmaceutical industry did not return
phone calls to respond to Feinstein's criticisms. But they have
previously insisted that their intellectual property rights must be
protected to provide the incentives necessary to encourage costly
research and development of AIDS-fighting drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Some drug manufacturers have also maintained that the free
distribution of drugs will lead to misuse and might spur the growth
of a drug-resistant strain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how they sleep at night, I really don't,''
Feinstein said of the drug company lobbyists who blocked her
amendment. ``I'm sorry for my show of emotion, but I've seen people
die of AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember, as mayor of San Francisco, trying to manage this
disease in its early days, when cause, let alone treatment, was
unclear,'' she said. ``When HIV/AIDS was devastating our community,
and many, many promising young people _ many of them my friends _
were struck down in the prime of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``So in some small way, I think I understand what policy makers
in any sub-Suharan African countries are going through now.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's order was cheered by several AIDS organizations,
including the national network AIDS Action as well as ACT UP
Philadelphia, which had persistently heckled Vice President Gore
during campaign appearances last year over the issue.

FORMER PRESIDENT OF EL PASO COMMUNITY NAMED TO HEAD MISSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MONROE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Adriana Barrera, a former president of El Paso
Community College in Texas, was named president of Mission College
on Wednesday, a decision hailed by community activists disappointed
when a previous attempt failed to hire a leader for the northeast
San Fernando Valley campus.
</P>
<P>
   Barrera, 49, impressed Los Angeles Community College District
trustees with her vision for Mission's future and her
``toughness,'' board President Kelly Candaele said. She also was
the top pick of a coalition of Northeast Valley residents that had
formed nearly a year ago, following the earlier controversial
president search.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased to join the Mission College family,'' Barrera
said, following a brief announcement ceremony during a board
meeting at Trade-Tech College in downtown Los Angeles. ``Hopefully,
I'm a quick enough learner.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Benavides, Texas, a hamlet of 1,800 residents about
90 miles west of Corpus Christi, Barrera will succeed interim
President Tom Oliver on July 1. She will earn $121,264 a year
administering a college campus that often sees itself as the most
neglected in the city's nine-campus system.
</P>
<P>
   With 7,000 students, Mission is bursting at the seams but has
botched previous expansion attempts. There has been infighting
among faculty and administrators, stemming from myriad issues such
as campus overcrowding and unpopular personnel changes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the problems, many consider the college an anchor of the
northeast San Fernando Valley. Members of the selection committee
said Barrera has the potential to transform Mission into a
first-class campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``She seems like she is going to take over a college, which is
on the verge of greatness, and just run with it,'' said Fern
Reisner, a Mission College American Federation of Teachers staff
guild representative who was on the committee that selected Barrera
and three other finalists for the post.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce College President Darroch ``Rocky'' Young headed the
search committee that had pared down the initial list of 30
contenders. Of the four finalists, he said, Barrera was the only
one with experience as a college president who had grappled with
issues similar to those she could face at Mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had been president in a very challenging political
environment,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   After earning a doctorate in psychology from Texas Tech
University, Barrera began her community college career as a
part-time instructor at Austin Community College in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later she was named president of El Paso Community
College, becoming the highest-paid female community college
administrator in Texas. She left in 1998 to become a grant writer
and consultant, after a majority of the El Paso Community College
District board of trustees refused to renew her contract.
</P>
<P>
   Barrera described her departure from El Paso as a tough
experience rooted in a difference of opinion over power-sharing
between her and some board members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board and I weren't working together,'' she said,
declining further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Olga Mapula, a former board chairwoman who left her post the
same year Barrera resigned, said she disagreed with the majority of
her colleagues at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``As times change, people on the board sometimes want somebody
different,'' said Mapula, who declined to provide further detail.
``It was just a difference of opinion on some issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Current board chairman Chuck Silva said the board and Barrera
``just parted ways.'' But he praised Barrera as an effective
administrator and predicted she would do well at Mission.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Fernando Valley, the naming of Barrera was met with
relief from residents observing the selection process. Some
expressed hope for the campus, saying it would receive greater
attention under a permanent president.
</P>
<P>
   ``A permanent president will get all of the attention and all of
the support they need to advance our issues effectively,'' said
Xavier Flores, a member of the original selection committee that
produced three candidates, all of whom the district's board of
trustees rejected last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Barrera's appointment ends a troubled yearlong selection process
that incensed some participants to such a degree they forced a
state audit of the district's selection policies. Others suggested
splitting up the nine-campus district.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley Coalition for a Responsible Community College
District was formed in July after the district's board of trustees
rejected the three candidates. Several coalition members, including
Flores, had been part of the first search committee and they
complained the board was ignoring them and, by extension, the
Northeast Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest search, Flores said the coalition recommended
Barrera as its first choice after seeing all four finalists at a
series of community forums two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had all the experience we deemed necessary,'' Flores said.
``She had worked with very similar communities in the past (and)
she had experience seeking resources, which we think was a critical
aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrera said she will spend her time between now and July 1
making frequent visits to the campus to get to know administrators,
the faculty and students at Mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream was to come back to a community college,'' Barrera
said. ``Not to be egotistical, but I was a good president.''

HOUSE OKS LONGER BAN ON INTERNET TAXATION AS PART OF
REPUBLICANS'  `ECONTRACT'
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Driving to seize the high ground on high tech
Wednesday, House Republicans pushed through a five-year extension
of the popular but controversial moratorium on new Internet taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed by a resounding 352-to-75 vote, despite
opposition by the White House and 39 of the nation's governors.
</P>
<P>
   It also marked the opening round of the House GOP's new
``eContract 2000,'' an agenda that all but mirrors Silicon Valley's
legislative wish list _ from opening trade with China to increasing
the number of H-1B work visas for skilled immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We assert that freedom is the answer, not government
intervention,'' declares the ``eContract,'' which includes a list
of proposals from tax and litigation relief to protection of
intellectual property and employee stock options.
</P>
<P>
   Modeled on the 1994 Contract With America that helped usher in
the House GOP majority, the manifesto is designed to freshen the
Republicans' election-year agenda and flatten opposition from
Democrats loath to cross the wildly popular high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   The initial success of the GOP initiative was apparent Wednesday
as many Democrats voted for the moratorium despite their
misgivings. The White House issued a statement opposing the bill,
but backed off a veto threat.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said the extension would ``in effect enact a
five-year hold on any further consideration of Internet tax issues,
creating uncertainty in a vital and rapidly growing industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The moratorium bans new taxes on Internet access, or  &LR; as well as
taxes that single out the Internet for discriminatory or multiple
taxes. The extension also would ban some existing Internet taxes in
a handful of cities and states.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chris Cox, R-Newport Beach, who sponsored both the original
moratorium and its extension with Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., predicted
the ``landslide'' bipartisan vote would melt White House
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no question in this election year where the supposed
father of the Internet will wind up,'' Cox said, referring to Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, has said
he supports the current moratorium, but thinks state and local
governments face a ``fiscal catastrophe'' if they are denied sales
taxes on online commerce. Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who has been
reluctant to endorse a permanent Internet tax ban out of fear of
lost state tax revenue, applauded Wednesday's House action.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's probable GOP opponent said the moratorium ``will provide
time to analyze the full impact of e-commerce and ensure that the
rapid growth of the Internet is not slowed by new taxes.'' Bush
said his position is ``consistent,'' because it refers to Internet
access taxes.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; States Fear Losses
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its political implications, the tax moratorium extension
also serves a strategic aim in the huge battle between state and
local governments and online retailers over sales taxes on Internet
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   States contend that they stand to lose billions of dollars in
sales tax revenue from online commerce and say that extending the
moratorium _ set to expire next year _ could delay attempts to
address the issue. They are backed by traditional ``brick and
mortar'' retailers such as Kmart Corp. and Home Depot Inc. that
must charge sales taxes and argue they face a disadvantage against
online retailers.
</P>
<P>
   The Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce, established
under the original moratorium to study the sales tax issue, failed
to agree on a recommendation despite a year and a half of work.
</P>
<P>
   Cox argued that state sales tax revenues have been booming,
despite dire predictions. ``What we now find,'' Cox said, ``is that
we have nothing to fear from good policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the current moratorium nor its proposed extension
actually bans sales taxes on Internet purchases, a point of much
confusion even among House members. Online purchases already fall
under a 1992 Supreme Court ruling on catalog sales, which require a
retailer to have a physical presence in a state before a sales tax
can be charged.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are supposed to report out-of-state purchases and pay
a ``use tax,'' but this is widely ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argued that extending the moratorium would create a
disincentive for states to simplify their admittedly byzantine tax
laws in order to ease collection of taxes on Internet and catalog
sales.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Conservative Opposition
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ernest Istook, R-Okla., a conservative renegade, denounced
Cox's bill. By 2006, he said, ``it may be too late to do anything''
about online sales taxes, and he accused supporters of ``scrambling
to show who can be `friendliest' to the Internet community, even if
it means turning a deaf ear to other businesses and ignoring common
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox scoffed at the argument, calling it ``a disconnect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The best that can be said is that it's the same subject _
they're both about the Internet,'' Cox said, accusing opponents of
trying to ``take this perfectly good bill hostage for an extraneous
issue which is admittedly important.''
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee has scheduled hearings on Internet
sales taxes for May 17.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans turned back Democrat-led attempts to shorten the
extension to two years. Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Atherton, voted for the
five-year extension, but said it avoids ``the very heavy,
complicated lifting work'' that is needed to resolve the sales tax
issue for states and localities.
</P>
<P>
   Cox insisted that states are awash in money, with California tax
revenues rising 20 percent last month alone, partly as a result of
the Internet tax moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The growth in the new economy is fueling the rest of the
economy,'' Cox said. ``By adopting a policy of not killing the
goose laying the golden eggs, we have had some great successes.''
</P>
<P>
   Governors and mayors, along with large traditional retailers,
are lobbying hard to stop the bill in the Senate. Senate Commerce
Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Arizona, recently postponed his
permanent Internet tax ban _ an issue he campaigned on in his fight
for the GOP presidential nomination _ after confronting stiff
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, the House GOP will continue its ``eContract 2000''
with a bill to repeal the 3 percent federal telephone excise tax,
originally imposed in 1898 to finance the Spanish-American War. The
tax is widely ridiculed as a tax on Internet use that falls
especially hard on low-income households. Repeal has strong
bipartisan support, including sponsorship by Rep. Robert Matsui,
D-Sacramento, who sits on the House tax-writing committee.
</P>
<P>
   The House also will consider a bill to increase the number of
H-1B temporary visas for skilled immigrants from the current
ceiling of 115,000 a year to 200,000.

STERN SHRUGS OFF COMPLAINTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The arrival of the NBA postseason has seen a
return of low-scoring games, new complaints over elongated playoff
series and the usual gripes over television dictating the schedule.
But commissioner David Stern, attending Wednesday night's game at
Staples Center, was typically unmoved by any concerns raised over
the status of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA this season installed a few refinements to the rules and
ordered officials to crack down on some physical defensive play.
The league got the desired result - seven of 29 teams averaged 100
points per game (only one team did last season), the league average
was 97.5 and no team averaged below 90 per game.
</P>
<P>
   But of the 16 playoff teams, only the Lakers (104.4) are
averaging triple digits, the league average is 90.9 and seven teams
are under 90 per game. And then there's the Miami-New York series,
which produced a decidedly ugly 82-76 Knicks win on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A cause for worry?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' Stern said. ``You know, what would be nice
is for us to allow personalities in either teams or series or
games. There was a time when you knew that Washington, they were
the bruise brothers and they would be slow, and San Antonio would
run, and if there was a series between two slowdown teams, it would
be something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have time to study the other team, and the playoffs
give you the time, our teams know other teams' moves better than
the other team does.... There's always a huge drop in the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   On other issues:
</P>
<P>
   -Stern said the league would not bend the salary cap rules to
grandfather in massive contracts like Shaquille O'Neal's $121
million deal. Lakers owner Jerry Buss and others have asked for an
exception to avoid the league's luxury tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a possibility,'' Stern said. ``Actually, if he'd (Buss)
like to, there are other teams that would be happy to relieve him
of those contracts, if they're causing a burden.''
</P>
<P>
   -Stern said the drawn-out first round, which featured five games
over 13 days, would probably be repeated in future years. The
schedule drew criticism from coaches and players but provided the
league additional revenue from its TV partners. NBC gained five
additional weekend games, and TNT and TBS were able to televise
games without overlapping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game on NBC instead of a cable network gets two and a
half times the number of viewers,'' Stern said, ``so more people
saw it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratings were up 9 percent, Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   -On the seemingly endless string of timeouts during playoffs,
Stern said, ``We're working on that one ... so that the last two
minutes (of a game) doesn't have to take 25.''
</P>
<P>
   One more time: Stern presented O'Neal with the MVP trophy before
the game and O'Neal got a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to thank Phil Jackson, the real coach of the year, my
teammates and most of all the Staples Center fans,'' O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson finished second to Orlando's Doc Rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Derek Fisher, suffering from a viral infection, was
sent home before the game, leaving the Lakers with just three
guards in uniform.

HOMEWORK PAYS AS SEGUI HOMER IN NINTH SINKS MARINERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The grapevine got to Kazuhiro Sasaki
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   David Segui had never seen Sasaki throw, not one pitch. But
Segui seemed to know all about the Mariners closer, who spent the
past 10 seasons in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Segui is plugged into the baseball network. Players talk all the
time, swapping notes. Have cell phone, will travel. Segui converted
all of that knowledge into a game-winning two-run homer, taking
Sasaki deep with one out and one on in the ninth for a 7-6 Texas
victory over Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows Sasaki has a great forkball and an average
fastball,'' Segui said, spilling no secrets as he gave the
five-second scouting report on the Mariners closer. Sasaki hasn't
faced many major leaguers yet but confirmed Wednesday that those he
has faced have gotten the word out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I wasn't going to hit the forkball,'' Segui said. ``I
wanted to get in a situation where he had to throw me a fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   That he did. Sasaki faced Segui after making his first defensive
gaffe of the season, allowing the limping Rafael Palmeiro to beat
out an infield hit to set up the game-winner. Segui came to the
plate with Seattle holding a one-run lead and Tom Evans
pinch-running for Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   Sasaki threw a forkball. Ball one. He threw another forkball.
Ball two. He threw a fastball. The rockets' red glare blanketed The
Ballpark In Arlington just seconds after Segui lit the fuse on his
second homer of the season. The vapor trail ended in the right
field bleachers as the Rangers stormed home plate, waiting for
Segui, the conquering hero. Sasaki hung his head briefly, then
walked off the mound with his first blown save and his first loss
in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think he could pull the ball like that,'' Sasaki said
through an interpreter, although the way he ran his hands through
his hair and the way he rubbed at his chin needed no interpretation
_ he was perplexed. ``The location of the ball was good, outside.
At the most, I thought he might get the ball in the gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised he was able to pull the ball like he did.''
</P>
<P>
   The grapevine has also gotten around about Segui, who was with
the Mariners at this time last year. He has the look of a Q-Tip
with the dyed blond tuft of hair on his scalp, but he has the swing
of a tornado _ he's crushing everything in his path and is leading
the AL in batting. He owns a glistening .387 average after a
5-for-12 series against the Mariners, helping the Rangers take two
of three.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's hot, no question about it,'' Seattle manager Lou Piniella
said of Segui. ``He's hitting everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella then took the time to scold Sasaki, ever so gently.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't cover first base,'' Piniella said, shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   The play in question was a liner hit toward right field by
Palmeiro with Segui in the on-deck circle. The Mariners had taken
the lead in the top of the ninth on a two-out Royce Clayton
throwing error, and Sasaki was two outs away from his fifth save
and a 6-5 Seattle win.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Mark McLemore broke quickly on the Palmeiro
liner, but Sasaki didn't. When McLemore knocked the ball down and
popped up, ready to fire a throw to first base, there was no one
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't think I could get to the ball,'' McLemore said. ``I
didn't think I could get to it, either.''
</P>
<P>
   If McLemore was willing to let Sasaki off the hook easily,
pitching coach Bryan Price wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never assume anything on a ball hit to the right side of
the infield,'' Price said. ``You go until you see that the first
baseman has the base. If he doesn't, you keep going. Particularly
with Palmeiro right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro is playing with a bad hamstring and gets down the first
base line about as quickly as the Mariners' designated limper,
quad-stressed DH Edgar Martinez. Even though McLemore tracked the
ball down on the outfield grass, the Mariners would have had an out
had Sasaki covered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake,'' Sasaki said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the mistake, Segui faced Sasaki with a chance to win
the game, not just tie it. And the Rangers, for all their troubles
in a 15-18 start to the 2000 season, have been good at winning
games in crunch time. They did it to Oakland Friday and Saturday,
and Wednesday the defending AL West champs made it three
last-at-bat wins in six days.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of leaving the Rangers stewing five games out of the
lead, the Mariners gave Texas a little boost of confidence. And
because of the two-game swing when teams face each other in the
division, Texas is just three games out. Last place seldom looks so
good. And first place could look better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that most people tend to forget is that this isn't
football,'' McLemore said. ``We don't play just 16 games. We play
162 game. So you can't get too wrapped up in a game like this. And
you can't get too wrapped up in it when you win like we did
(Tuesday, a 13-3 Seattle victory).
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing matters except tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow'' is now today. And the Mariners open a four-game set
in Oakland Thursday night against the team many picked to win the
West this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed with what happened here today,'' catcher
Dan Wilson said. ``You don't want to rally to take the lead into
the bottom of the ninth and lose it. But we play again tomorrow. We
can't carry this game with us tomorrow.''

BAKER'S GAME SHAPE WON'T CUT IT SYDNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Come September, Vin Baker will enter the Olympic
Stadium in Sydney, Australia. The mind pauses to wonder who he'll
most resemble:
</P>
<P>
   Will the Sonics' big man be transformed by then into a sleek and
steely eyed gold-medal hunter, like the cyclists, track runners and
fencers?
</P>
<P>
   Or might it be best for Baker to slink to the back of U.S.
contingent during Opening Ceremonies and parade with the guys from
table tennis, shooting and Greco-Roman wrestling?
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, Baker runs the risk of sticking out in that
crowd, too.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, nearly every single Olympian who will represent the
U.S. in the 2000 Summer Games has a chance to be better fit and
more professional than the formerly fabulous Mr. Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Just the other day, a United States Olympic Committee dispatch
brought forth news of the feats of one U.S. swimmer named Neil
Walker.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old Wisconsin native won five gold and two silver in
the World Swimming Championships and has set himself up for a
monster run in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   A picture of Walker showed the oxygen-rich holder of five world
records with his bevy of medals _ all splayed across the smoothly
muscled chest of a world-class athlete.
</P>
<P>
   That subject _ world-class athletes with hard bodies who deserve
to be rewarded for their hard work _ is what brings us to the
question du jour:
</P>
<P>
   What should Baker do this summer?
</P>
<P>
   Should he hit the pool with Walker and do sprint laps until he
swears off late-night excursions to Wild Ginger for jazz and good
times?
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe Baker could work out with two-sport wonder Chris Witty.
</P>
<P>
   Witty, you may remember, is the gold-medal winning speed skater
who is now attempting to make the U.S. Olympic cycling squad again
(she was an alternate in Atlanta.)
</P>
<P>
   Witty has thighs the size of Hoh Rain Forest Douglas fir.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a guarantee: If Baker worked out with Witty this summer,
he would never, ever cheat and run foul line-to-foul line during an
NBA playoff game again.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Tommy Lasorda. The Dodger Blue hall of famer was
just named manager of the U.S. Olympic baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we all know about Lasorda's love of pasta. But maybe Baker
could get a few tips from Lasorda on the Slim Fast or whatever it
was diet on which Lasorda shed layers of his carbo-loaded gut.
</P>
<P>
   If Lasorda can't get through to Baker, there's always a chance
Mary Lee Tracy could be the answer.
</P>
<P>
   At her gym in Cincinnati, Tracy is whipping 80-pounders like
Dominique Moceanu into shape for the U.S. Olympic gymnastic trials,
set for August in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy is no Bela Karolyi. She won't be locking Baker in his
bedroom with a slice of apple, calling him ``my little piglet.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the U.S. gymnasts can call 4 ounces of broiled chicken
dinner, hey, it's an option for the Sonics' big man.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, Baker needs to do something. As a card-carrying
member of the U.S. Olympic basketball team, Baker was chosen to win
a gold medal this summer in Sydney. That was way before his long
and stunning slide into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the end of a horrific second half of the season
that Sonics coach Paul Westphal finally benched Baker. It took two
other Sonics starters to go down with Baker to soften the blow.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics are certain that Baker and his handlers are
soft-peddling the criticism. If Baker has some issues with
Westphal, they still cannot be egregious enough to warrant such a
display of unprofessionalism. Depression is indeed a serious
whirlpool, but Baker has the talent and support to work out of it.
</P>
<P>
   But it is clear that for much of the second half of this past
season, Baker could hardly be taken seriously as an NBA player.
</P>
<P>
   Now, this 28-year-old whose ability to handle eating, partying
and constructive criticism seems non-existent is going to be an
Olympian?
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics have no official reason to wish for Baker to withdraw
from the U.S. Olympic squad. Perhaps they believe that performing
on a world stage with the NBA's elite will be the impetus for Baker
to get it together.
</P>
<P>
   That theory could backfire, however.
</P>
<P>
   In case anyone missed it, the real point of a Dream Team
excursion to the Olympics is for the NBA's elite to have themselves
a party on the way to winning their gold.
</P>
<P>
   Baker doesn't need a party. He doesn't need to roll into
training camp next October like he threw too many shrimps on the
barbie.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't his summer of love. By September, he should go to
Sydney only as a reward for getting back to being the old Vin
Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, while Gary Payton and Co. are quaffing some good
times Down Under, Baker should be getting his priorities and his
game in order _ for the real season.

IT'S NOT ONLY FUN AND GAMES FOR SONY'S NEW PLAYSTATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON Z. COHEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ With music blasting and demonstrations
projected on two giant screens, Sony Computer Entertainment America
Inc. gave North America its first peek at the PlayStation 2 game
console during a media preview Wednesday in a downtown Los Angeles
studio.
</P>
<P>
   The second in a new generation of game systems driven by 128-bit
processors, PlayStation 2's North American version will be slightly
different from its Japanese counterpart on sale since March. Sega's
Dreamcast _ which also uses a high-performance 128-bit processor _
hit the market last September.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's console goes on sale Oct. 27 for $299, in time for the
holiday shopping season. It carries the same price tag as the
original PlayStation introduced in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it will be the biggest consumer electronic
launch in history, with 1 million units initially being shipped
into North America. An additional 2 million units will ship by
March 2001.
</P>
<P>
   PlayStation 2 is expected to command the attention of
professionals attending the Electronic Entertainment Expo, which
begins Thursday at the Los Angeles Convention Center and features
400 exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   It is expected to attract 55,000 interactive entertainment
professionals and an estimated 1,900 software titles will be on
display at the show, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   Sony estimates 50 game titles for PlayStation 2 alone will be
introduced at the show.
</P>
<P>
   With its improved graphics, Internet connectability and the
ability to play digital video discs, PlayStation 2 is being billed
as the hub of the wired entertainment center.
</P>
<P>
   ``PlayStation 2 is not the future of video game entertainment,
it is the future of entertainment, period,'' said Kazuo Hirai,
president and chief operating officer of Sony Computer
Entertainment America. ``It's an entirely different platform that
will serve as the catalyst for the broadband revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Japanese version, the PlayStation sold in the United
States will have a port for a 3.5-inch hard disk drive. The
American version also is able to play DVD video without the need
for additional memory.
</P>
<P>
   Sony officials denied the addition of the port was a reaction to
Microsoft's proposed game console, X-Box, which will have a
built-in hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, there is a PlayStation in one of every four U.S.
households, said Andrew House, the company's vice president of
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The target audience for PlayStation 2 is broader than that for
the original system, House said.
</P>
<P>
   PlayStation 2's audio and video capabilities will appeal to
music and film buffs, and its Internet connectability will bring in
people interested in the cutting edge of technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the system's compatibility with existing PlayStation games
will encourage users to graduate to the new system, House said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're able to bridge the gap between hardware that has dogged
our industry in the past. It's absolutely crucial that we validate
the platform with content,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sony has encouraged outside game publishers such as THQ Inc. of
Calabasas to develop titles for the new system. THQ enlisted the
help of game developer Volition Inc., which normally builds games
for the more powerful personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   But the more powerful processor in the new generation of game
consoles is making it possible to develop higher quality games,
said Jim Boone, senior producer for the role-playing game Summoner,
the first game THQ plans to release for PlayStation 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have to compromise on any of our technology. It's
been a lot of fun to develop the console game,'' Boone said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Summoner will lend itself well to multiplayer online
play, making it a good match for the PlayStation 2, which in the
future will connect to the Internet via a broadband connection.
</P>
<P>
   The type of broadband connection by which players can connect
has not been determined.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced on Wednesday that he
was separating from his wife, Donna Hanover. He said that as he
battles prostate cancer he will need Judith Nathan, the woman he
describes as a ``very good'' friend, ``more now than maybe I did
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani did not say whether he would continue his race for the
U.S. Senate against Hillary Rodham Clinton, but he did say that his
political career was not at the moment his first concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really care about politics right now,'' Giuliani said.
``I'm thinking about my family, the people that I love and what can
be done that's honest and truthful and that protects them the best.
I'm not thinking about politics. Politics comes at least second,
maybe third, maybe fourth, somewhere else. It'll all work itself
out some way politically.''
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinary news conference in Bryant Park, Giuliani
spoke at length to reporters about his relationships with his wife
and Nathan. He spoke in a soft voice with downcast eyes as he
tightly gripped both sides of the lectern. The mayor described his
emotional state as ``sad'' and then added, ``I feel terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Three hours later, Hanover appeared outside the gates of Gracie
Mansion and, with a wavering voice and tears in her eyes, said:
``Today's turn of events brings me great sadness. I had hoped to
keep this marriage together. For several years, it was difficult to
participate in Rudy's public life because of his relationship with
one staff member.''
</P>
<P>
   Joannie Danielides, Hanover's press secretary, said that Hanover
was referring to Cristyne Lategano-Nicholas, Giuliani's former
communications director who is now president of NYC &AMP; Company, the
city's tourism bureau. Friends of Hanover said on Wednesday that
she had described the relationship between her husband and
Lategano-Nicholas as ``intimate'' while Lategano-Nicholas worked at
City Hall. The mayor has denied having had a romantic relationship
with Lategano-Nicholas, who left City Hall last May and married
Nicholas Nicholas, a sports writer, in February.
</P>
<P>
   Hanover also said that ``beginning last May, I made a major
effort to bring us back together. Rudy and I re-established some of
our personal intimacy through the fall. At that point, he chose
another path. Rudy and I will now discuss the possibility of a
legal separation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanover added that she and the couple's children, Andrew, 14,
and Caroline, 10, will continue to live at Gracie Mansion, the
mayor's official residence, ``for at least the next few months''
because of security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Lategano-Nicholas issued this statement on Wednesday: ``I have
no desire to speculate why Donna Hanover decided to issue the
statement that she did. Understandably, this is a difficult time. I
wish both the mayor and Donna Hanover a successful resolution.''
Lategano-Nicholas added that she was ``proud'' to have worked for
Giuliani, and that he ``is and will continue to be one of the
greatest mayors in our city's history.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After attending a fund-raiser at a private home in the
Westchester County town of Pelham Wednesday night, the mayor smiled
and showed off a blue and orange baseball jacket with the word
Pelham written on the front. But he had no reaction to the
statements of his wife. ``I am not going to react to it,'' he said.
``I said all I am going to say on that earlier today, this is all
very painful.''
</P>
<P>
   He also brushed aside questions about whether he was close to
withdrawing from the race, reiterating that he would make a
decision based on his medical treatments. He added that he had been
buoyed again by sympathetic New Yorkers. ``I have lots of people
supporting me, lots of people who help me and I hope to give some
of that back.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Hanover said that although she and her husband had
talked in recent days about ending their 16-year marriage, Hanover
did not know that Giuliani was going to announce their planned
separation at his news conference. Friends said she learned of her
husband's remarks immediately after the conclusion of the news
conference, which was held on the outdoor balcony of The Bryant
Park Grill in midtown Manhattan. The friends described Hanover as
``distraught.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Giuliani's senior advisers said on Wednesday that the
mayor's announcement caught them by surprise, too, even though
Giuliani had made no secret of his estrangement from his wife over
the past few years and had announced last week that Nathan, 45, a
divorced mother and registered nurse who works for a pharmaceutical
company, was a ``very good friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Pictures of Giuliani and Nathan leaving a restaurant together
were first published on May 3 by The New York Post. Giuliani
announced that he had prostate cancer in an early, treatable form
on April 27.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether Giuliani had planned beforehand to
announce the possible separation at the news conference, or whether
he wandered into the remarks as reporters questioned him. Since the
mayor learned he has prostate cancer, he has become increasingly
personal and introspective in his news briefings.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday Giuliani had no official statement, and only began
to talk about his marriage after a reporter asked him for a
reaction to comments made on Tuesday by Joseph Bruno, the state
Senate majority leader. In a radio interview in Albany, Bruno urged
Giuliani to resolve his differences with Hanover.
</P>
<P>
   She first publicly addressed the issue in a hastily arranged
news conference outside St. Patrick's Cathedral last weekend,
saying that her husband and her marriage ``have been very precious
to me.'' Bruno added that he was concerned that Giuliani's personal
life would distract him from the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   In responding to the question about Bruno, Giuliani never did
say what he thought of the majority leader's remarks. Instead, he
said: ``This is very, very painful. For quite some time it's
probably been apparent that Donna and I lead in many ways
independent and separate lives. It's been a very painful road and
I'm hopeful that we'll be able to formalize that in an agreement
that protects our children, gives them all the security and all the
protection they deserve, and protects Donna.''
</P>
<P>
   When pressed by reporters about whether he meant a legal
separation, the mayor at first said he did not want to give
details. But when asked if his wife would move out of Gracie
Mansion, Giuliani at last used the word ``separation'' by
responding haltingly: ``Nobody, nobody, nobody is moving anywhere.
Everybody is secure and safe. What I said is that we should try to
work out a separation agreement. That's different.''
</P>
<P>
   The marriage is Giuliani's second. His first marriage ended in
divorce and was annulled.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There were only a small group of reporters and television
cameras present in a small space, and many were only a few feet
from the mayor. As Giuliani continued to talk at length about his
relationships with the two women, the briefing became an unusually
intimate confessional for a man who has until recently guarded most
aspects of his private life. At one point, Giuliani was asked if
the media had caused the damage in his public life.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' responded Giuliani, who has often blamed the media in
the past. ``The media makes the damage worse, it didn't cause the
damage. I take responsibility for everything that I've done. And
you have a right to ask me and then I have a right to answer or not
answer. And that's the way I think we can have a respectful
relationship with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani also spoke warmly of both Nathan and Hanover. ``Judith
_ Judith Nathan is a very, very fine person,'' the mayor said.
``She's been a very good friend to me, before I had to deal with
the decisions that I have to make about my illness and what to do
about it, and I rely on her, and she helps me a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he turned his comments to his wife. ``Donna Hanover is a
wonderful woman,'' Giuliani said. ``And she's a wonderful mother.
She's someone that I respect tremendously. The fact that we've
grown independent, we've grown more separate over the years, who
knows why those things happen? But she is a very, very fine,
wonderful person, and she's an extraordinary mother and I have
tremendous respect for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what his emotional state was at that moment, Giuliani
responded: ``My emotional state is I'm very sad. And I feel
terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Physically, Giuliani, 55, has said he feels healthy, and has
kept a vigorous schedule with appearances around the city and three
trips upstate over the past two weeks. But he has also spent much
of his time meeting with doctors to determine his cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
   His acknowledgment of Nathan as a good friend came as his
illness was generating much public sympathy. Even so, recent polls
show that Clinton is still running ahead of Giuliani statewide, and
that the mayor did not get what pollsters call a ``bump'' in
support after his announcement of his illness.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani concluded his comments about his turbulent personal
life by saying that it had not affected the job he was doing as
mayor. ``It's a job that I love,'' Giuliani said. ``I love the
people of the city of New York. Some of them love me and some of
them hate me, but I think they all have a reaction to me.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The job is not affected at all by this, and never
will be.''

INQUIRY TARGETS L.A.'S TRANSIT AUTHORITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY ANDERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Opening a second civil rights front in Los
Angeles, federal officials said Wednesday they have launched an
investigation into L.A.'s transit authority and a company that
gives rides to disabled people, following allegations that
thousands of complaints have been ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Transit Administration's civil rights division is
investigating a complaint filed by 24 people who claim Access
Services drivers are abusive, miss pickups and run chronically
late. Some advocates for the disabled claim riders who complain
risk retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   The FTA probe comes as the U.S. Justice Department threatens to
sue the city of Los Angeles, alleging systematic civil rights
abuses by the Los Angeles Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint filed by the Western Law Center for Disability
Rights contends the Metropolitan Transportation Authority knew as
early as 1997 about Access Services' poor performance but gave it
more money.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, just last week the MTA board was set to renew the
company's $159million, five-year business plan when wheelchair user
Joey Schine of Van Nuys appeared and lodged a complaint against the
service, which provides 1.6million rides annually. The board
delayed its vote a month, and MTA officials conceded they knew
Access Services was the target of thousands of complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``The MTA has largely ignored its para-transit responsibilities
and hasn't taken the need seriously enough,'' said Eve Hill,
executive director of the Western Law Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without transportation, they can't have jobs, social lives or
all the things we take for granted. When the service doesn't work,
it's a major blow to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's executive director, Richard DeRock, dismissed the
Western Law Center complaint as ``very vague.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see the issues they are raising,'' he said. ``We have
been 91percent on time, on average. It's good, if not better than
anywhere else in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The FTA could withhold funding from Access Services and refer
the case to the U.S. Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Glendale resident Fernando Roldan, 28, said he was stranded at a
Northridge shopping center for two hours March 3 after the computer
system at Access Services failed. ``I've been stranded a couple of
times,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bellflower resident Betty Dangerfield, 50, said she joined the
complaint after an Access Services driver slammed the door on her
leg Dec. 29, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a real nasty attitude. They should screen the drivers
better because some of them are real humdingers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The FTA is investigating 15 additional cases and has examined
dozens of other complaints against the company since 1994. The
details and outcomes of those cases were not available.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found, for the most part, that transit agencies do not
deliberately refuse to comply with the regulations,'' said an FTA
spokeswoman, Karen Clarke.
</P>
<P>
   An independent survey of passengers in March found 52 percent
rated the service as excellent, 19 percent as good, 13 percent as
fair and 16 percent as poor, DeRock said. Still, he said his
company supported independent audits to identify problems in
service.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government pays 70 percent of Access Services'
annual budget of $50.8 million, and the MTA pays the rest. The
budget includes $40 million for taxicab and van contractors and
$2.4 million in salaries for Access Service's 51 employees. DeRock,
the highest-paid employee, makes $109,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Riders pay $1.50 to $4 a ride depending on the distance.
</P>
<P>
   Jim McLaughlin, MTA director of transit planning, said the MTA
is working to find solutions. ``The worst thing that can happen is
if you strand someone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schine said a van driver threatened to strand him April 24
outside a karaoke bar shortly after midnight and then insulted him.
</P>
<P>
   He said he went to the board meeting because the MTA had ignored
complaints he made nearly every week for the past four years.
``Nothing had been done because no one gave a damn,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schine's complaints are among 300 to 400 complaints a month
Access Services receives. In August, a record 1,583 people made
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   MTA officials defend the number, however, by citing a 1998
consultant's report that showed Access Services had 2.2 complaints
per 1,000 riders in 1997, compared with a high of 18 per 1,000 in
Miami and a low of 0.7 in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates believe more must be done.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Wilson, assistant executive of the Los Angeles Department
on Disability, said her office has complained in writing and in
person to the board, without receiving a reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The MTA took the information and said they were going to look
into it,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Norma Jean Vescovo, executive director of the Van Nuys-based
Independent Living Center of Southern California, said riders who
complain risk retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The MTA has lawyers set up to prevent people from doing
anything,'' she said. ``If an individual has a complaint, Access
Services won't accept it without a name. Then the person gets
retaliated against. Either they don't get picked up or have their
rides cut off.''

<P>
   Public safety officials ordered everyone out of Los Alamos,
N.M., Wednesday as intensifying winds sent a week-old fire into the
town of 11,000. But officials at the Los Alamos National Laboratory
said they were confident that the nuclear material and chemical
explosives were protected, even if the laboratory itself started
burning.
</P>
<P>
   Police, sheriff's and fire department officials went
door-to-door urging people to pack up and get out as quickly as
possible. No injuries were reported, but about 200 homes were near
the fire or already burning early Wednesday evening, and more were
destroyed as the flames advanced through the evening. The fire
command post itself was forced to leave.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton declared Los Alamos a disaster area.
</P>
<P>
   A plume of smoke 17,000 to 20,000 feet high was covering all of
northern New Mexico and moving east into Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be in Houston by tomorrow,'' said Jim Paxon, a fire
spokesman with the U.S. Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fire blew up, basically,'' Paxon said.
</P>
<P>
   Crews could not fight the blaze at the line of fire, he said,
but would continue to work on its periphery.
</P>
<P>
   Brush fires reached some of the laboratory's far-flung property
on Wednesday, setting ablaze a structure at the Weapons Engineering
Tritium Facility, but the flames were quickly put out, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   A power failure caused by fires in the northwest suburbs knocked
out pumps supplying some of the firefighters with water. Emergency
generators were being rushed in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole town is burning,'' Pauline Stone, 73, who has lived
in Los Alamos since 1949, said at a Red Cross shelter in White
Rock. ``It's all going to disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Wind gusts up to 41 miles per hour pushed the fire to the east
and southeast, toward the town of the laboratory. Winds were
expected to die down somewhat overnight, then kick up to 50 miles
per hour Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bad fire,'' said Jim Danneskiold, a Los Alamos
laboratory spokesman. ``The wind situation is not good.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire, called the Cerro Grande fire after the mountain where
it started, was set a week ago by the National Park Service in the
northwest corner of Bandelier National Monument to clear brush, but
flared out of control over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Fire is always a worry in the dry pine forests that surround the
town of Los Alamos and Los Alamos National Laboratory, whose
thousands of buildings _ most modern, but a few wooden structures
that date to the Manhattan Project of the 1940s _ occupy 43 square
miles of canyons and mesas. In 1977, the La Mesa fire burned part
of the laboratory grounds, and a 1996 fire, accidentally ignited by
campers, devastated some 15,000 acres of nearby forest.
</P>
<P>
   A main area of public concern was Technical Area 55, where the
laboratory keeps most of its nuclear materials. The surrounding
area was virtually free of trees and other burnable fuel,
Danneskiold said, and was about five or six miles from the nearest
firefighting line, and even further from any blaze.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also a building built to nuclear standards, virtually
bomb proof,'' he said. ``It supposedly can survive earthquakes,
huge fires, airplane crashes and disasters in general.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there have been no intact nuclear weapons at the
laboratory for 15 years. Non-nuclear explosives are stored in
concrete bunkers buried under a couple feet of earth. ``We're
pretty confident in those bunkers,'' Danneskiold said. ``The La
Mesa fire burned over the same bunkers and nothing happened.''
</P>
<P>
   But the outlook was critical for the town itself, where
residents continued to stream out Wednesday night. The western end
of town, evacuated initially Sunday, included 500 homes. A northern
section evacuated Wednesday moments before the blowup also
contained 500 homes, firefighters said.
</P>
<P>
   In Santa Fe, upscale hotels where rooms often cost $300 a night,
were offering evacuees rooms for $25.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Siegfried Hecker, a former director at the Los Alamos
Laboratory who now leads Russian cooperative studies there, was
packing his car late Wednesday to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it's serious for the town,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about the people, but I think we have everything
else in good shape. At this point, the lab looks in good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Concerned Citizens for Nuclear Safety, an
environmental group in Santa Fe, worried that toxic and radioactive
fumes could be released into the air if the fire spread to drums of
waste stored at the laboratory. ``We are concerned the lab is not
fully knowledgeable of what is in each drum,'' said Suzanne
Westerly, the group's acting executive director.
</P>
<P>
   She also said that plants around the laboratory have absorbed
radioactive contaminants over the years, which are now being
released into the air as the plants burn.
</P>
<P>
   But Danneskiold said that the laboratory continually monitored
the air around it and ``there was no evidence of airborne
contamination'' after the last major fire, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The laboratory's radioactive-contaminated waste is stored on a
barren area eight to nine miles from the from the fire, Danneskiold
said. ``There's no vegetation in the area to burn.''
</P>
<P>
   Danneskiold said that while the laboratory has been closed
because of the fire since Monday, power was on at the labs, and
guards and emergency personnel remained on duty. Security in
top-secret areas was being maintained, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that there was an old lab dump site known as
Acid Canyon near a part of town that was evacuated on Sunday, but
said he had no idea of conditions there. He said environmental
restorations had removed from the canyon old wastes dating from the
1940s and 1950s.

DODGERS LOSE PITCHERS' DUEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - In the era of power and offense and bandbox ballparks,
a classic pitching matchup remains possible. The ingredients needed
are a couple of quality pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson and Kevin Brown fit neatly into the mix.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time the highly anticipated matchup between the two
staff aces concluded, neither were part of it. Both lasted eight
innings, but it was Tony Womack's single off reliever Terry Adams
with none out in the ninth that gave Arizona a 2-1 win over the
Dodgers at Bank One Ballpark on Wednesday to sweep the three-game
series.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have tied their season-high with four straight
losses. Arizona's won seven straight.
</P>
<P>
   Adams (2-3) allowed leadoff singles to Andy Fox and Travis Lee
to put runners on the corners in the ninth, and Womack singled to
deep right.
</P>
<P>
   Byung-Hyun Kim (1-1) struck out pinch hitters Dave Hansen and
Todd Hollandsworth with two runners on in the ninth for the win.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who entered the game 7-0 with a 0.93 ERA in seven
starts, tied a season high with 13 strikeouts in eight innings.
It's the seventh time in eight starts he's hit double digits in
strikeouts. He's done it 132 times in his career, second to Nolan
Ryan's 215.
</P>
<P>
   But for the first time this season Johnson didn't win his start.
He had a no-decision, allowing a season-high eight hits and one
run. His ERA rose to 0.95.
</P>
<P>
   Brown yielded one run on six hits in eight innings. He struck
out six and walked three as his mastery continued, though he
doesn't have the record to show it. In the four starts since
returning from the disabled list,Brown's allowed just one run per
outing. But he's 1-1 with a 1.20 Todd Hundley delivered the
Dodgers' lone run, a second-inning homer. It was the switch
hitter's eighth homer of the season, but m resurgence as a
right-handed batter continued with his third homer from that side
this season. Before this year, Hundley hadn't hit a homer
right-handed since 1997. His career high for right-handed homers in
a season came in 1996 when he hit six. The only other year he's hit
more than three is 1992, when he had four.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Hundley made his Dodgers debut last season against
Johnson and struck out three times, albeit under very different
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be nice to be able to see the ball this time,'' Hundley
said before the game.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona had a few chances to tie it with a base hit, and the
Diamondbacks finally broke through with two outs in the seventh.
Brown issued a two-out walk to Jay Bell, and Luis Gonzalez followed
with a line-drive double to tie it 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   While Hundley's homer provided the run, it was truly a night of
pitching.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had opportunities in nearly every inning, getting a
runner into scoring position in four of the innings. But the
Dodgers never got the hit to provide the cushion.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had runners on first and second with one out in the
first, but Johnson struck out Gary Sheffield and Eric Karros. After
Hundley's one-out 408-foot homer to deep left-center field, Jose
Vizcaino ( d to third. F.P. Santangelo hit a sharp grounder just
inside the bag at third, and Andy Fox was able to get a glove on it
and prevent Vizcaino from scoring. Mark Grudzielanek lined out to
right to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   A two-out double by Vizcaino in the fourth went to waste when
Brown popped out to center, but the Dodgers had another chance when
Karros doubled with one out in the sixth. Again, Johnson toughened
and struck for the third time and Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Brown was battling through a few jams of his own. His
first perfect inning didn't come until the fourth. Arizona had
second and third with one out in the second, thanks in part to
another throwing error by Beltre at third base, but Brown struck
out Fox and Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   An inning later, back-to-back one-out singles by Jay Bell and
Luis Gonzalez put Brown in another fix. He retired Erubiel Durazo
on a groundout, walked Steve Finley but struck out Bernard Gilkey,
who's homered four times off Brown.

ANGELS LOSE IN NINTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- The Oakland A's scored four runs in the ninth inning
to break a 3-3 tie and beat the Angels, 7-4, Wednesday night before
15,300 at Edison Field, but it was more than that.
</P>
<P>
   By winning two of the three in the series, the A's (17-17) moved
ahead of the Angels (17-18) in the A.L. West standings, both teams
still trailing the first-place Mariners (17-14). It may be early,
but the A.L. West teams are in a cycle of playing each other for
the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have now lost two of three to both Seattle and
Oakland, with Texas in town for a four-game series beginning
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The A's won the game in the ninth against Angels reliever Mark
Petkovsek, who gave up all four runs in the ninth after pitching a
scoreless eighth. Ben Grieve had an RBI single, Jeremy Giambi drove
in two with a single and Eric Chavez scored the fourth run with a
single as the A's batted around.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels scored once in the ninth on Darin Erstad's third hit
of the night, an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Kent Bottenfield did not have his normal good
command, walking four to match a season-high. But he managed to
work his way through 6 2/3 innings, giving up three runs and
keeping the game close.
</P>
<P>
   A's starter Mark Mulder, making only his fifth major league
start, stifled the Angels before leaving the game with a 3-1 lead,
two out and Darin Erstad on first base in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Mulder allowed only six hits in 7 2/3 innings and retired nine
in a row at one point, but he was helpless when the bullpen entered
the game and blew the lead. First, T.J. Mathews gave up an RBI
double to Tim Salmon, then closer Jason Isringhausen yielded an RBI
double to Garret Anderson, tying the game at 3.
</P>
<P>
   Mulder was good, but he also got some help from an unexpected
source -- third-base ump Mike VanVleet.
</P>
<P>
   What started out as a promising fourth inning for the Angels
turned to frustration and anger, most of it coming from Angels
hitting coach Mickey Hatcher.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson led off the inning with a single to center, then scored
on a double to left by Glaus. Anderson, though, was ordered back to
third base after VanVleet ruled Glaus' double was touched by a fan.
</P>
<P>
   Replays showed clearly the ball short-hopped the short fence in
left and stayed in the park without fan interference, and the bad
call cost the Angels at least one run. And Anderson compounded the
ump's bad call with a baserunning mistake of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Edgard Clemente hit a sharp grounder to Eric Chavez at third,
but Anderson was caught between third and home and was tagged out
by catcher Ramon Hernandez. Matt Walbeck followed with a single to
load the bases, but Durrington grounded into a double play to end
the inning.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Hatcher drew the ire of crew chief Al Clark, who was
the second-base ump. Hatcher yelled from the dugout and Clark,
moving toward the Angels' dugout, tossed Hatcher out of the game.
Manager Mike Scioscia came out to argue, but he soon found himself
trying to keep Hatcher away from Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Angels first baseman Mo Vaughn tried to restrain Hatcher and the
two fell to the ground on the infield dirt at the shortstop's
position. Hatcher eventually left the field as Scioscia considered
his argument, albeit more controlled, with Clark.
</P>
<P>
   The A's opened the scoring in the second inning when Miguel
Tejada singled home Matt Stairs and Jeremy Giambi for a 2-0 A's
lead. Ben Grieve's homer in the third made it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels made it 3-1 in the bottom of the third on Darin
Erstad's homer, his fifth of the season. But after the Angels
threatened and failed in the fourth, A's starter Mark Mulder
retired the next nine hitters in row before Erstad broke the string
with a leadoff single in the eighth.

KOBE'S SHOT SAVES LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shaquille O'Neal rocked and rolled, but the
Phoenix Suns did not roll over. The MVP filled up his shiny new
trophy with all the points and rebounds his team could possibly
need, but the Lakers proved they could not thrive on Shaq alone.
</P>
<P>
   Even Superman needs an occasional assist from Wonderboy.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal celebrated his MVP award with 38 points and 20 rebounds,
but it was Kobe Bryant's breathtaking jumper from the top corner of
the key with 2.6 seconds left that carried the Lakers to a dramatic
97-96 victory over the Suns on Wednesday in Game 2 of the
conference semifinals at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers took a 2-0 lead in the series, but they very nearly
let the homecourt advantage slip away.
</P>
<P>
   After leading for most of the game, the Lakers let the Suns pull
within 93-92 with just over 2 minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal missed a pair of free throws, Ron Harper made only 1 of
2, Bryant coughed up a turnover and suddenly the Suns had seized
the lead, 96-94. Bryant made 1 of 2 free throws to pull within a
point, but it took one more defensive stand from the MVP to set up
the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal blocked Penny Hardaway to get the Lakers one last
possession. Bryant made the most of it, crossing up Jason Kidd near
the top of the key, dribbling to his left, then sinking the jumper
over Kidd and Rodney Rogers for the 97-96 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns got an opportunity for a go-ahead basket, but Hardaway
missed a running jumper at the buzzer, with Harper hanging on him.
No foul was called.
</P>
<P>
   After a 28-point rout in Game 1, the Lakers expected a different
look or two from the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a game that takes a great deal of concentration for a
basketball club to come back and play, be prepared for a team
that's going to make changes,'' coach Phil Jackson said before the
game. ``We can't expect it to be the same type of game at all. I
anticipate that Phoenix will have some remedies for Shaq in the
hole. And when the ball goes in, they'll probably try to get it out
of his hands. And we'll have to wait an decision as to how we're
going to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the other end of the floor, I thought just some miscues,
obviously timing-wise, probably led to (the Suns') high turnover ra
game. I think that will be remedied too. Obviously, their 3-point
big guys, (Clifford) Robinson and (Rodney) Rogers, we have to be
prepared for them to make some shots tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was partially correct. The Suns did start putting guards
in O'Neal's lap with some regularity, Phoenix cut way down on its
turnovers, and Rogers and Robinson started to contribute a bit.
</P>
<P>
   It was evident from the first possession that the Suns would
throw every available body at O'Neal. But the occasional
double-teams had little effect, and the league's new MVP made 9 of
17 shots in the first half, scoring 21 points to stake the Lakers
to a 50-46 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   And the Lakers needed everything O'Neal gave them. After a fast
start,Bryant was slowed by foul trouble, picking up his first two
fouls in a 36-second span midway through the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   With Bryant on the bench, the Suns outscored the Lakers down the
stretch, took a brief 4-point lead and settled for a 26-24 edge at
the end of the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Plagued by 23 turnovers in their Game 1 loss, the Suns started
to unravel a bit in the second quarter. Their five turnovers led to
6 points by the Lakers, who rode the momentum, and 13 points from
O'Neal, to the halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant played just 11 minutes in the half, scoring 6 points, but
he made an impact on defense, with two blocks and a steal.
</P>
<P>
   With Glen Rice also starting slowly (4 points in the first
half), the bench picked up the slack _ Robert Horry scored 7
points, and Brian Shaw added 6.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson and Hardaway scored 11 points each for the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   With Bryant in foul trouble and Derek Fisher home with a viral
infection, the Lakers were thin at guard.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was hopeful that the Lakers' first-round experience with
the Sacramento Kings _ who fought back from a 2-0 deficit to tie
the series _ would be ``a process that hopefully we can learn
from.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this day-to-day, game-to-game type thing is really
what a series is all about,'' he said. ``Stay focused from game to
game and not worry about what's going on anywhere else in the
league, not worry about Shaq's MVP and just concentrating on what's
really important today now, and the next play as it goes along
makes teams have the ability to win championships.''

RAIDERS' TURNER SERIOUSLY ILL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Oakland Raiders safety Eric Turner, a former
All-American at UCLA, is suffering from a serious stomach illness
that is believed to be career-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible, terrible situation,'' said a high-ranking
Raiders official. ``We're going to respect the family's wishes on
this, but people should really be concerned for this kid.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if Turner's illness is life-threatening, Raiders
officials declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started out as an ulcer and it's developed into something
worse,'' the Raiders official said.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, a nine-year pro who lives in Westlake Village, did not
attend the Raiders' minicamp last week for personal reasons. It was
the second team gathering Turner missed over the last two months.
He has not been treated by team doctors since the end of last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to contact the 31-year-old Turner, his family and agent
were unsuccessful over the last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I saw him at the end of last year, he told me he
was having trouble keeping food down,'' said Willie Shaw, Kansas
City Chiefs assistant head coach/defensive-back coach who was
Oakland's defensive coordinator last year. ``He told me he was
going to get it checked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner is believed to be under a doctor's care at a Ventura
County hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, who attended Ventura High, was an All-American safety at
UCLA and the second overall pick by the Cleveland Browns in the
1991 NFL draft. It was the highest draft position for a defensive
back in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   He spent six years with the Browns/Baltimore Ravens, earning Pro
Bowl honors in 1994 after tying for the NFL lead in interceptions
with nine. He also returned an interception for a 93-yard
touchdown, second longest in team history.
</P>
<P>
   Turner signed with the Raiders in 1997, leading the team in
tackles his first year with 111 and returning a fumble 65 yards for
a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, Turner played in just six games before a
foot injury sidelined him the remainder of the season. Over the
last two years, Turner has missed 16 games because of various ankle
and leg injuries. He also missed most of 1995 with the Browns after
suffering a back injury.
</P>
<P>
   Turner finished his UCLA career fourth on the all-time tackles
list with 369.

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
LOS ANGELES _ The comparisons to Michael Jordan just keep piling
up.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant, who has often been compared to the former Chicago
Bulls star, provided more material for such talk by nailing a
14-foot jumper with 2.6 seconds remaining to give the Lakers a
97-96 victory over the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday in Game 2 of the
Western Conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   The game, played before 18,997 at the Staples Center, gave the
Lakers a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series, which resumes Friday
at America West Arena in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't feel like I was in a Laker uniform or even at the
Staples Center,'' said Bryant of his Jordanesque game-winner. ``It
felt like I was on the playground. That's how it felt.''
</P>
<P>
   Just don't ask the Suns how it felt.
</P>
<P>
   It's bad enough that the Lakers have everything under the, well,
sun.
</P>
<P>
   They have Shaquille O'Neal, the newly crowned Most Valuable
Player who once again proved he is the game's most dominating
presence by piling up 38 points and 20 rebounds in Wednesday's
game.
</P>
<P>
   They have Phil Jackson, generally considered to be the NBA's
best coach. And it seems they have all the talent in the world with
guys like Bryant and Glen Rice suiting up with O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   But do they have to have all the luck, too?
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's jumper, a pull-up from 14 feet over Jason Kidd and
Rodney Rogers for his only basket of the fourth quarter, squeezed
the last breath out of a Suns team that refused to die.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix had rallied from a 12-point third-quarter deficit,
taking a two-point lead on a layup by Penny Hardaway, the last of
his 27 points, with 47 seconds to play. And when he knocked down
only one of two free throws three seconds later, the Suns had to
feel good about their chances.
</P>
<P>
   But Hardaway's next shot was blocked by O'Neal, giving the
Lakers one last possession with 23 seconds remaining. Bryant
dribbled the clock down before pulling up for the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal then blocked a desperation shot by Hardaway to preserve
the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed,'' said O'Neal, who added five blocks to his
night's work. ``We didn't play very well. We didn't bring our `A'
game tonight. But Kobe saved us with a fabulous shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed he did. Just like Jordan would have done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking that I just had to make it,'' said Bryant, who
finished with 15 points. ``I tried to read the defense and see
where everybody was. I just felt like I was in the back yard. I had
a flashback to when I was a kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to go right, but Jason cut me off. I cut left and went
up for the jump shot. I had to pull the shot back a little bit
(because of the defense), and thank God it fell.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns have to be wondering what they did to insult the
basketball gods, letting this one slip away.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give credit to a great player,'' said Hardaway,
who finished with eight assists. ``He made a tough shot _ a
double-clutch shot on the way down with two seconds left on the
clock. That's something you want him to take.''
</P>
<P>
   But making it?
</P>
<P>
   Entering the game, you would have thought the Suns didn't have a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the Lakers enter with a 15-2 record in games played
on Wednesday, they had a 5-0 record against the Suns this year,
including a sweep of four regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the fact that O'Neal was psyched up after NBA
commissioner David Stern handed him the Maurice Podoloff Trophy,
signifying the MVP, in a brief pre-game ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   But there were signs this might not be the Lakers' night after
all.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant was limited to 11 first-half minutes because of foul
problems, and O'Neal was forced to pick up the offensive slack,
scoring 21 points to stake the Lakers to a 50-44 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the Suns just couldn't capitalize, though Rice had another
mediocre game (13 points) and Bryant had those foul problems (34
minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Robinson (30 points, 13 in the fourth quarter) and
Hardaway did all they could, but there was precious little help for
them. Kidd (13 points, six assists) still isn't 100 percent after
coming back from a broken ankle suffered six weeks ago, and Sixth
Man of the Year Rogers had his second straight poor game (eight
points on 3-of-11 shooting).
</P>
<P>
   And the Suns still have no answer for O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, O'Neal recently dubbed himself ``The Big Aristotle,''
but it's the Suns who have to be doing all the deep thinking: How
to stop O'Neal?
</P>
<P>
   So far, Phoenix coach Scott Skiles has yet to find a plan to
even slow O'Neal, who entered the game averaging 30.7 points and
16.8 rebounds in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns have tried single coverage, double teams and going
small in an effort to force O'Neal to come out on defense, but
nothing has worked, as evidenced by O'Neal's two-game averages of
37.5 points and 17 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   So, how do you stop a 7-1, 335-pound center who has the moves of
a much smaller player?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an (unanswerable) question,'' O'Neal said. ``An X-Files
question.''

  c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
The sensation of winning a series at home had become such a distant
memory, the Astros almost didn't recognize it.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Is that what that was?'' Astros second baseman Craig Biggio
wisecracked.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it was. The Astros, led by the precision pitching of
Shane Reynolds, bumped off the Colorado Rockies 5-1 Wednesday night
at Enron Field. They took two of three from the Rockies to win
their first home series since they took two of three from the
Dodgers in the final series in Astrodome history.
</P>
<P>
   Considering they've managed only a 5-10 record at their new
ballpark, some Astros no doubt long for the Astrodome, but don't
count Reynolds among them. He has mastered the art of pitching at
Enron, compiling a 2-0 record with a 3.15 ERA at the
hitter-friendly yard.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more impressive is the fact he has allowed only one home
run in 20 innings at the ballpark often referred to as Home-ron
Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made good pitches, kept the ball down, worked in and out and
got key outs,'' said Reynolds, who allowed four hits and a run in
seven innings. ``We scored some runs early, and that always gives
you some confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   If Reynolds, whose five-game winning streak matches his career
best, could pitch every day, the Ar~stros would be )z?~9yH3irst &LR; 1

KOBE'S SHOT SAVES LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shaquille O'Neal rocked and rolled, but the
Phoenix Suns did not roll over. He filled up his shiny new trophy
with all the points and rebounds a team could possibly want, but
the Lakers for once needed more than just an MVP performance.
</P>
<P>
   Even Superman needs an occasional assist from Wonderboy.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal celebrated his MVP award with 38 points, but it was Kobe
Bryant's jumper from the top corner of the key with 2.6 seconds
left that carried the Lakers to a heart-stopping 97-96 victory over
the Suns on Wednesday, in Game 2 of the conference semifinals at
Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers took a 2-0 lead in the series, but they nearly let
the homecourt advantage slip away. Bryant wouldn't let that happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't bring our `A' game today. Kobe saved us,'' O'Neal
said.
</P>
<P>
   He did it with flair. O'Neal blocked a Penny Hardaway jumper
with 22.9 seconds left to set up the final play. Coach Phil Jackson
did not call timeout, leaving the show to the Lakers' 21-year-old
playmaker. Bryant crossed up Jason Kidd at the top of the key,
dribbled to his left and pulled up for a 14-foot jumper over Kidd
and Rodney Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Pandemonium erupted among the 18,997 in attendance as the ball
swished cleanly through. In Bryant's mind, however, all was calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt like I was in the backyard, I honestly did,'' he
said. ``Just kind of flashed back to when I was a kid and I just
tried to go right, (Kidd) cut it off, so I came back to the left. I
was going up for the jump shot. I think I saw his hand out of the
periphery, so I had to kind of pull the shot back a little bit,
then guide it through.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant had won games at the foul line before, but this was his
first game-winner from the field, and he didn't hesitate to say it
was the biggest shot of his four-year career. How did it feel?
</P>
<P>
   ``Feels like doing it again,'' Bryant said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kobe is known to make shots like that,'' said teammate Glen
Rice. ``Thank God it went in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers outshot the Suns 53.4 percent to 43.5 percent, but it
took one last defensive stand to secure the win an O'Neal block of
Hardaway, with Ron Harper also in his face, at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knew who was going to have the ball,'' Harper said.
``He was playing good all game long, so our main thing was to slow
him down some.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite getting shut down in the final seconds, Hardaway
finished with 27 points and eight assists. Clifford Robinson
carried the rest of the load, scoring 30 points for the Suns, who
also outrebounded the Lakers 43-37.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hardaway and Robinson who sparked a 31-23 fourth quarter
for Phoenix, erasing what was once a 13-point Laker lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little disappointed in the players today,'' Jackson
said. ``We had a real good third quarter, we had a 15-point chance
opportunity, to extend the lead when we were up by 12, with seconds
to go and we gave up a 3-point shot (by Robinson) at the end of the
quarter, and started the fourth quarter in a daze.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they came out with a lot of energy and put the game in
jeopardy. And we were lucky to pull it out, actually probably
didn't deserve that win, other than the fact we were able to play
some defense down the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Several offensive miscues nearly doomed them. O'Neal badly
missed a pair of free throws, Harper made only 1 of 2, and Bryant
coughed up a turnover in traffic as the Lakers watched a 1-point
lead turn into a 2-point deficit in the final minutes. Bryant also
uncharacteristically missed 1 of 2 from the line.
</P>
<P>
   Until the end, it had been an off-night for Bryant. He got in
early foul trouble and finished with just 15 points. The Lakers
bench made the difference, with Brian Shaw and Robert Horry scoring
12 points each.
</P>
<P>
   So the Lakers head to Phoenix having preserved homecourt
advantage but having given the Suns reason for hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gained a ton of confidence,'' Hardaway said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was not concerned about that possibility, saying,
``There is no such thing in this kind of a situation. You play for
what it's worth, and every game is different, has it's different
personality.... (The Suns' comeback) in itself might give them a
hope, but who cares? They're going back home, they've got to have
that kind of ability or else they're in jeopardy anyway.''

   PHOENIX - In the era of power and offense and bandbox ballparks,
a classic pitching matchup remains possible. The ingredients needed
are a couple of quality pitchers, and Randy Johnson and Kevin Brown
fit neatly into the mix.
</P>
<P>
   They dueled for eight intensity-filled innings in their highly
anticipated matchup, before pitch-count and circumstance got them
both.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was Tony Womack's RBI single off reliever Terry
Adams with none out in the ninth that gave Arizona a 2-1 win over
the Dodgers at Bank One Ballpark on Wednesday to sweep the
three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers tied their season-high with four straight losses,
three of which have come in the opposition's last at-bat. Arizona
tied a club record with its seventh consecutive win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating any time you lose,'' said Brown, who is 1-1
with a 1.20 ERA in four starts since returning from the disabled
list. ``It all boils down to the fact we lost the game. We had a
lead and didn't hold it.''
</P>
<P>
   After Brown allowed six hits in eight innings, Adams (2-3) was
brought into a situation that became too familiar for the Dodgers
in this series. Onan Masaoka joined the club before the game,
making him the lone lefty in the bullpen, but a 1-1 game in Arizona
two days after throwing 74 pitches in a minor-league start isn't
the ideal situation. So Adams got the call.
</P>
<P>
   He then faced three left-handers, each of which singled. Andy
Fox began the rally with a single to right, Travis Lee moved him to
third with a single to right and Womack hit a ball to deep right-
center to score Fox for the win. Lefties were hitting 9 for 39
(.231) against Adams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a difference,'' said catcher Todd Hundley, whose
second-inning homer accounted for the Dodgers' only run. ``It's a
big difference when (manager) Davey (Johnson) has some other
options.''
</P>
<P>
   Byung-Hyun Kim (1-1) struck pinch hitters Dave Hansen and Todd
Hollandsworth out with two runners on in the ninth for the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I haven't seen him, I have to be a professional
hitter and be prepared,'' Hansen said. ``I got some good hacks on
him, but didn't get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who entered the game 7-0 with a 0.93 ERA in seven
starts, tied a season high with 13 strikeouts in eight innings.
It's the seventh time in eight starts he's hit double digits in
strikeouts. He's done it 132 times in his career, second to Nolan
Ryan's 215.
</P>
<P>
   But for the first time this season Johnson didn't win his start.
He had a no-decision, allowing a season-high eight hits and one
run. His ERA rose to 0.95.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Green had three hits off Johnson and Jose Vizcaino had a
three-hit night, including two off Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at it now, I guess it was what everybody was hoping it
would be,'' Johnson said. ``Going up against someone of Kevin
Brown's caliber, you don't have a whole lot of room to make
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley's third right-handed homer (eight overall) gave the
Dodgers an early lead, but they couldn't come up with the big hit
that could create a rally.
</P>
<P>
   In the first they had two on and one out and Gary Sheffield and
Eric Karros struck out. In the sixth, Karros doubled with one out
but Adrian Beltre and Hundley struck out, and then there was the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   In total, the Dodgers were 1 for 10 with seven strikeouts with
runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the guy on the ropes a couple of times and couldn't get
him,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``Brownie pitched a
great game and we couldn't get him any runs. It was a tough
series.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown yielded one run, struck out six and walked three. But it's
the two-out walk in the seventh inning to Jay Bell that he'd like
to have back. Luis Gonzalez followed with a double to the
left-center field gap to tie it 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so sure it was a that bad of a pitch (to Gonzalez),
the walk ahead of that is what set it up,'' Brown said. ``I slipped
on one pitch and the last pitch was pretty darn close. I thought it
was pretty darn close.''

   BSALIM, LEBANON _ Did the American ambassador to Israel decide
the target of Israel's bombing of Lebanon last Friday? Incredible
as it seems, Martin Indyck's intervention appears to have done just
that. The leak of Indyck's intervention, via impeccable diplomatic
sources, is remarkable. That a U.S. ambassador can, in effect,
decide the target site of Israel's bombs is one thing. But Indyck
also happens to be the former head of AIPAC, the most powerful
Jewish-Israeli lobby group in the United States....By Robert Fisk,

ANGELS LOSE IN NINTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- The Oakland A's scored four runs in the ninth inning
to break a 3-3 tie and beat the Angels, 7-4, Wednesday night before
15,300 at Edison Field, but it was a play as early in the fourth
inning that had at least one Angel steaming mad.
</P>
<P>
   The A's won the game against Angels reliever Mark Petkovsek, who
gave up all four runs in the ninth after pitching a scoreless
eighth. Ben Grieve had an RBI single, Jeremy Giambi drove in two
with a single and Eric Chavez scored the fourth run with a single
as the A's batted around.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels scored once in the ninth on Darin Erstad's third hit
of the night, an RBI single. However, they wasted opportunities
early in the game, and had one potential rally thwarted by a
third-base ump Mike VanVleet.
</P>
<P>
   What started out as a promising fourth inning for the Angels
turned to frustration and anger, most of it coming from Angels
hitting coach Mickey Hatcher.
</P>
<P>
   Garret Anderson led off the inning with a single to center, then
scored on a double to left by Troy Glaus. Anderson, though, was
ordered back to third base after VanVleet ruled Glaus' double was
touched by a fan.
</P>
<P>
   Replays showed clearly the ball short-hopped the short fence in
left and stayed in the park without fan interference, and the bad
call cost the Angels at least one run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't need to see a replay,'' manager Mike Scioscia said.
``I wouldn't have argued if I wasn't positive. But that call didn't
win or lose the ballgame. We can't hang the loss on an umpire.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson compounded the ump's bad call with a baserunning
mistake of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Edgard Clemente hit a sharp grounder to Eric Chavez at third,
but Anderson was caught between third and home and was tagged out
by catcher Ramon Hernandez. Matt Walbeck followed with a single to
load the bases, but Trent Durrington grounded into a double play to
end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Hatcher drew the ire of crew chief Al Clark, who was
the second-base ump. Clark began moving toward the Angels' dugout,
then tossed Hatcher out of the game. Scioscia came out to argue,
but he soon found himself trying to keep Hatcher away from Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Angels first baseman Mo Vaughn tried to restrain Hatcher and the
two fell to the ground on the infield dirt at the shortstop's
position. Hatcher eventually left the field as Scioscia continued
his argument, albeit more controlled, with Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher was still upset after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get thrown out because I was arguing that play,''
Hatcher said. ``Our guy hits into a double play and they get out of
it, and I say 'That lucky SOB,' talking about their pitcher.
(Clark) starts hollering at me. I wasn't talking to him, it had
nothing to do with him. That's terrible.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying to tell me I can't talk to my players. What's he
looking in our dugout for in the first place? ... I'm doing my job
as a hitting coach, hollering at my guys to get 'em going and he's
going to tell me I can't do that? That's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Kent Bottenfield did not have his normal good
command, walking four to match a season-high. But he managed to
work his way through 6 2/3 innings, giving up three runs and
keeping the game close.
</P>
<P>
   A's starter Mark Mulder, making only his fifth major league
start, stifled the Angels before leaving the game with a 3-1 lead,
two out and Erstad on first base in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Mulder allowed only six hits in 7 2/3 innings and retired nine
in a row at one point, but he was helpless when the bullpen entered
the game and blew the lead. First, T.J. Mathews gave up an RBI
double to Tim Salmon, then closer Jason Isringhausen yielded an RBI
double to Anderson, tying the game at 3.
</P>
<P>
   By winning two of the three in the series, the A's (17-17) moved
ahead of the Angels (17-18) in the A.L. West standings, both teams
still trailing the first-place Mariners (17-14). It may be early,
but the A.L. West teams are in a cycle of playing each other for
the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have now lost two of three to both Seattle and
Oakland, with Texas in town for a four-game series beginning
tonight.

HILL IN NO MOOD TO TALK
</HEADLINE>
 MRI RESULTS-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Pitcher Ken Hill had not yet gone to the doctor for
an MRI, but he was in no mood to talk about his latest injury,
waving off a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Results of Wednesday night's MRI confirmed the initial
diagnosis, a torn intercostal muscle, which is located in the upper
ribcage below his right armpit. Hill (3-4, 7.41 ERA) fell to his
knees in pain after making a pitch in the third inning Tuesday
night, was taken out of the game and placed on the 15-day disabled
list.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems 15 days won't be enough to heal the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it's a great concern of ours,'' manager Mike
Scioscia said. ``When you're talking about a torso injury with a
pitcher, it's as devastating as an arm injury. It's safe to say
it's going to be a while, more than two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have been careful with Hill all season because of an
arthritic right elbow, but his elbow is fine.
</P>
<P>
   Losing Hill from the rotation isn't the only pitching change for
the club. Ramon Ortiz, struggling at 2-2 with a 6.90 ERA, was
optioned to Triple-A Edmonton and replaced by left-hander Jarrod
Washburn.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Washburn had an injury similar to Hill's both last
season and in spring training this year, though Washburn's strain
was below the ribcage. Washburn missed seven weeks last season, but
just three weeks this year before reporting to Edmonton, where he
went 3-0 with a 3.52 ERA in five starts.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn will start Saturday's game against the Rangers in
Ortiz's spot. Hill's spot in the rotation comes up Sunday, when the
Angels are expected to activate Jason Dickson (strained hip) from
the DL to start that game against the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   As for the highly-touted Ortiz, the move could be seen coming
weeks ago because of his inconsistency, and not because of the
small tear in the cartilage of his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ramon has the potential to be a premier pitcher in this
league,'' Scioscia said. ``We wracked out brains and talked about
it, but we think this is the best course to take.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nobody in the world who would feel good about going
back to the minor leagues. But Ramon absolutely understands what he
has to work on to reach his potential. He's the first guy to say he
has not been pitching well. ... Here's a guy trying to throw 98 mph
when he throws 92-94 mph. He gets out of whack and loses command.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I don't feel good but I understand what I need to
do,'' Ortiz said through Preston Gomez, the Angels' assistant to
the GM. ``I'm not surprised. I understand it's part of the
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Gary DiSarcina had an MRI on his ailing right shoulder
Tuesday night, and the results revealed normal wear and tear on his
right shoulder. Doctors still cannot determine the cause or the
source of the injury. More tests are expected to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Adam Kennedy was not in the starting lineup
Wednesday for the first time this season. Kennedy simply needed a
day off. Trent Durrington, called up Tuesday to replace DiSarcina
on the roster, got the start at second. ... A's center fielder
Terrence Long was scratched from the lineup Wednesday after getting
hit in the mouth by a ball during batting practice.

KOBE GAINS TEAMMATES' CONFIDENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the opening moments of the fourth quarter of
Wednesday night's playoff game at Staples Center, with the Lakers'
lead down to three points thanks to back-to-back turnovers and the
unexpectedly hot shooting of the Phoenix Suns' Clifford Robinson,
Kobe Bryant dribbled the ball near the right baseline.
</P>
<P>
   He began a drive to the basket, hesitated when Jason Kidd joined
Penny Hardaway in a double team, then jumped and heaved an
off-balance shot that crashed into the edge of the backboard and
caromed into a Sun's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Out-of-control moments like these are still part of the life of
young Kobe. In years - or months - past they might have resulted in
a scolding from the coach, eye-rolls by the veterans and a few
minutes on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, Phil Jackson and the Lakers veterans have
another way of dealing with the 21-year-old Bryant's tendency to
shoot wildly. They tell him to keep shooting. That approach paid
off again.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment that counted most Wednesday, with the Lakers down
by a point and seconds left in the game, Bryant dribbled, dribbled,
dribbled, crossed over from right to left, then pulled up in front
of defenders Kidd and Rodney Rogers and nailed an 18-footer.
</P>
<P>
   The difficult shot with 2.6 seconds on the clock gave the Lakers
a 97-96 victory and a 2-0 lead in their second-round series.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a kid who makes some mistakes but comes out and just
plays hard. That last shot was definitely a hell of a shot,'' said
the Lakers' Ron Harper. ``Kobe Bryant is one of them guys, you just
sit back and see what he's going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   That clutch jumper will be replayed over and over on television
until the Lakers and Suns meet again Friday night in Arizona. But
it won't tell you as much about Bryant's improvement as some of his
misses.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant came into this game having turned in back-to-back-to-back
sub-.500 shooting performances: 13 for 30 in the Game 4 loss to the
Sacramento Kings, 7 for 16 in the Game 5 victory over the Kings,
and 8 for 17 in the Game 1 victory over the Suns. Not disastrous
but not sharp.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 4, a drive and errant pass in the closing minutes had
sealed the Lakers defeat.
</P>
<P>
   But those mistakes are more easily shrugged off now, by coaches,
teammates and fans. The fact Bryant is allowed to keep misfiring,
to keep testing the defense, until he finds the range, is a
positive sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think guys on the team have more confidence in me than in
the past. They have more confidence I'll come through,'' Bryant had
said before the game. ``I think it just clicked all of a sudden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it happened after that long East Coast trip.''
</P>
<P>
   That trip was in February. The Lakers went 6-0 and Bryant was
their leading scorer twice. He had a Lakers season-high five steals
one night in Chicago, and a 26-point, seven-rebound, six-assist
game at Charlotte the next night.
</P>
<P>
   It was around that time that Bryant's defense began to get
notice. His all-around excellence and more responsible handling of
the ball changed everything.
</P>
<P>
   If it wasn't a case of Bryant maturing, it was the Lakers taking
a more mature view of his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Now) I might turn the ball over or make a mistake, and he
(Jackson) might whistle to let me know,'' Bryant said, contrasting
that with the abrupt benchings of years past. ``I'll (look over
and) say, `Yeah, I know.'''
</P>
<P>
   The best part is, he does know.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the season's first 15 games on the injured list with a
broken right hand. The Lakers won 11 of them. That might have been
the best thing to happen to Bryant and the team.
</P>
<P>
   They learned they could win without Kobe. More important, he
learned they could win without Kobe. When he returned, early in a
stretch in which the Lakers went 23-1, he seemed intent on fitting
in with a winning program.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wednesday's game, Bryant seemed surprised to hear he'd
received a fourth-place vote for the NBA Most Valuable Player award
that went to Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What?'' Bryant said. ``I didn't expect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson spoke of the possibility Bryant will be the Lakers' -
and the league's - MVP some day.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Shaq matures and grows older, whatever his limitations will
bring to him, he may take the roll that Kareem (Abdul-Jabbar) took
in the later part of his career,'' the coach said. ``Play part of
the game, concentrate on one area, loaf down court like Kareem did
... and let Kobe take the prime (role). I don't see that happening
for a number of years, though.''
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't an MVP-type night for Bryant. His minutes limited
after he picked up his third foul midway through the second
quarter, he finished with 15 points, on 6-for-11 shooting, and six
assists. The scoring total was his lowest since March.
</P>
<P>
   But on the night O'Neal became the first Laker since Magic
Johnson in 1990 to receive the MVP trophy, Bryant showed again why
he'll be the next. &QL;

WORDS FROM THE WISE FOR LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ We now know Shaquille O'Neal, er, (begin ital)Big
Aristotle(end ital), does not live by Nietzsche alone, that his
other book is ``Bartlett's Familiar Quotations.''
</P>
<P>
   So we're pretty sure he already knows what the world's deepest
thinkers would have said if conjured up for a few comments after
the Lakers' 97-96 victory Wednesday over Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The great philosophers wouldn't have wasted much breath noting
how the Lakers didn't merely defeat the Suns in the first two games
of their best-of-seven Western Conference semifinal series, they
toyed with them.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix has to be fit to be fried, losing Game 1 by 28 points
and coming within three seconds of taking Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   For the Lakers, now is no time to step back and admire the
carnage. As John Dryden said, ``Fortune befriends the bold.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' mandate this weekend is clear: Don't let the recent
past be a prologue.
</P>
<P>
   It's all very quaint that O'Neal celebrated his first MVP crown
by carving up his counterpart. That would be the commoner, Luc
Longley, whom O'Neal outscored 38-4.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal skewered the Suns for 37 points in Game 1, so it would
appear he is intent on practicing what Aristotle preached about
excellence not being a singluar act but a habit.
</P>
<P>
   As the Lakers head to Phoenix for Friday's Game 3, they should
remember what Henry Wadsworth Longfellow said: ``The greatest
firmness is the greatest mercy.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't look good if the Lakers let the Suns back into the
series as they did Sacramento in the first round. It is better for
all involved that the Lakers put Phoenix away posthaste.
</P>
<P>
   Suns guard Jason Kidd covered the Staples Center court better
than he did in Game 1, but it's obvious his gimpy left ankle is far
from completely healed. At this point, he doesn't need Kobe Bryant
harrassing him, he needs rest. The least the Lakers can do is lend
an assist to the Suns' assist man.
</P>
<P>
   In the name of being humane, the Lakers ought to put Longley out
of his agony. After trying unsuccessfully to slow O'Neal, Longley
likely has a few choice quotes for CNN broadcaster Fred Hickman,
the only voter not to see the 7-foot-1 as the clear MVP.
</P>
<P>
   Longley might start with Alexander Pope's observation that
``fools rush in where angels fear to tread.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority of Longley's nine misses were short, a sure symptom
of chronic tightness of the muscles and an anemic morale. Rest
would be the best medicine. The Lakers ought to see that he gets it
pronto.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the flu-addled Derek Fisher, the Lakers are fairly
hale. If anything is beaten up, it's their collective aura. They
looked bulletproof in forging the league's best regular-season
record (67-15). Then they lost twice at Sacramento and chinks
appeared in their armor where there had been spikes.
</P>
<P>
   Portland will be watching closely to see if it should cower in
the Lakers' presence. O'Neal and Co. shouldn't give the Trail
Blazers or any other possible playoff opponent any reason to feel
optimistic. The Lakers would be prudent to remember the Chinese
proverb, ``The greatest conquerer is he who overcomes the enemy
without a blow.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, who shut Kidd down and stepped up for 25 points in Game
1,took his licks Wednesday. Midway through the second quarter,
Bryant found himself with more fouls (three) than assists (two). He
had six points in 11 minutes in the first half and finished with
15.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after being hailed for playing with controlled
abandon, Bryant looked a little reckless. With the score tied at 94
with a little over a minute left, Bryant drove into traffic and
lost the ball. Penny Hardaway's putback at the other end put the
Suns, who never led in Game 1, ahead 96-94.
</P>
<P>
   Sent to the foul line with under a minute to play and a chance
to tie it, Bryant made his first attempt and missed his second.
However, with the game on the line Bryant clearly remembered the
words of Elbert Hubbard, who said, ``Don't make excuses, make
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's last shot was his best: a fearless lean-away jumper
with 2.6 seconds to play that found nothing but net and sank the
Suns. It figures. As Edward Gibbon said, ``The wind and the wave
are always on the side of the ablest navigators.''

 &HT;    Fight over Elian arrives in Atlanta
 &HT;    EDS: PHOTOS FOR THIS STORY AVAILABLE BY 10:35 AM EDT
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The doors of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals swung
open today to let in 100 people _ most of whom spent the night on
Forsyth Street _ eager to see lawyers argue the fate of 6-year-old
Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think Elian should go back to a Communist country,''
said Hazel Nunn Gaines, 78, who had been waiting in her wheelchair
since 11 p.m. Virtually all of those in line to get into the
stately old one-time Post Office were fiercely opposed to the
government's effort to return the child to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Television remote trucks lined the east side of Forsyth Street
from Walton to Luckie. Atlanta police in black battle dress guarded
the other side, where those hoping to get into the courthouse lined
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing Fidel could do for his country is to drop
dead,'' said Gaines, who told reporters she spent the night
outdoors because she thinks it's important for Americans to express
their opinions on major issues.
</P>
<P>
   Grace Vazquez, 54, of Tampa came to the United States from Cuba
14 years ago and never went back. She's been going back and forth
to Miami to join the protests there, and came to Atlanta with her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian should stay. His dad could stay, too,'' she suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about retaliation against the Cuban family of Elian's
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, she said, ``Everybody on the island
is under repression because Fidel is a devil.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she and her husband, a trustee of the Cuban-American
National Foundation, spent the night on lawn chairs ``because I
don't really want to miss this show.''
</P>
<P>
   Griselle Alejandre flew in from Miami late Wednesday to assure
she would get a seat in the courthouse today. ``I came here to
support the Gonzalez family for justice and liberty for Elian,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only interest is that the child live in liberty, not
necessarily in Miami, but somewhere else in the United States ...''
</P>
<P>
   Alejandre spent the night in front of the courthouse equipped
with a Cuban flag and a blanket.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Calderon, 38, of Miami, who said he came to Atlanta two
days ago, carried a hand-written sign that said `` God sent him
here, let's not send him back to the devil.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those in line were reporters, or stand-ins for reporters
who did not win one of the media seats in the small courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Two University of Georgia seniors were first in line. Michael
Phelan, an English major, said his father, who works at CNN, hired
him and a buddy to spend the night on a downtown Atlanta street
corner.
</P>
<P>
   Phelan said he passed the hours ``sitting around watching the
bums on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox writers Jingle Davis, Lyda Longa, Rhonda Cook and Mark
Bixler contributed to this article.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: STAR WARS IN CYBERSPACE
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (f) financial categories for
release
 &HT;    Sunday, May 14.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ You don't have to be a Star Wars fan to sense how a
struggle between good and evil pervades the cosmos of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   A plethora of technologies enables open networks, like the
Internet, to supplant closed systems, like cable outlets and TV
shows. As these new links become ever faster and cheaper, today's
commercial gatekeepers and government regulators are at risk of
being pushed aside in a world in which virtual communities
distribute a wide range of useful content.
</P>
<P>
   But the unifying force of an open Internet that empowers
billions of people remains under continual threat from the powers
of the Dark Side. They were on display anew when the ``Love Bug''
e-mail virus went on a worldwide wrecking mission, only to morph
into an invidious ``Mother's Day'' message from a Darth Vader
clone.
</P>
<P>
   Today's carefree Internet users no longer need to fathom the
plumbing that runs underneath their mouse clicks, just as
movie-goers need not know that the final battle sequence in which
the Death Star is destroyed was based on a 10-minute montage of
films from the two World Wars.
</P>
<P>
   There's a price to be paid, however, for ignorance among
customers and arrogance among vendors.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Love Bug'' was written in Microsoft's Virtual Basic, a
programming language that underpins the Windows operating system.
Its aim, at which it largely succeeds, is to enhance ease of use.
Hackers write Windows code for the same reason criminals rob banks:
that's where the money is.
</P>
<P>
   It's quite possible to defend yourself against cyber-attacks.
Just ask the folks at the National Security Agency, the computing
colossus that sits astride the global high-tech communications
frontier.
</P>
<P>
   The agency volunteers that were it to be viewed as an
enterprise, in terms of dollars spent, floor space used, and people
employed, it would rank in the top 10 percent of the Fortune 500
companies.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no public tours. There's no e-mail address book.
There are no classified computers hooked to the Internet. And so,
lo and behold, no viruses choke agency traffic or erase its
databases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we work with highly sensitive information, we are
frequently the subject of speculation _ and highly imaginative and
creative fictitious pieces in the media,'' the super-secret agency
allows on its modest unlinked Web site.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not put off by such movie lore and still yearn to work
there, then don't try to apply online to one of the world's
foremost wireless-tapping ventures. In fact, you must send an
ordinary letter to a post office box.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, we could also achieve a full measure of protection
from the Dark Side by emulating the intelligence agency and cutting
our Internet cords. And, even if we decide to dabble a bit, we
could still refrain from becoming ``interactive'' and always back
up our fresh data before it turns sour.
</P>
<P>
   But such strategies also rob us of the true promise of the
digital future _ an open society where millions of content
providers toil in a peaceable kingdom. Maybe in his next Star Wars
adventure, George Lucas can figure out how to make it all work.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Pawns in Iran's game
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   By landslide margins in preliminary and now in runoff elections,
Iranians have voted themselves a moderate government, but it is
very much an open question whether powerful Islamic conservatives
still in control of key institutions will let them have it.
</P>
<P>
   The early signs are not encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have shut down 16 reform newspapers in recent weeks.
Reform figures have been arrested on disloyalty charges. And now
the reactionary clerics are charging fraud at 10 percent or more of
Tehran's polling places, a potential precursor to annulling the
election.
</P>
<P>
   And, in one of the crueler barometers of Iran's political
atmosphere, the courts have tightened the screws on 13 Iranian Jews
charged with spying for Israel, displaying three who are said to
have confessed.
</P>
<P>
   To say the charges are implausible is to put the matter mildly.
Dozens of capitals have protested the arrests, many in strong terms
rare to diplomatic lingo. French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
called the charges ``totally fabricated.''
</P>
<P>
   By any common understanding of the word ``justice,'' it is
impossible to take the Iranian claims of a spy ring seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers, store clerks, students and merchants don't appear
to have been in espionage-worthy positions or locations. They have
been imprisoned for 15 months. They are being tried in secret in a
Revolutionary Court where the judge is also the prosecutor and sole
juror, the ultimate legal stacked deck.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the 13 are hostages in Iran's political struggle,
tokens of the conservative ayatollahs' credentials as keepers of
the Islamic faith, and burdens _ as evidence they are supposedly
soft on Israel _ to reformers who disavow the trial.
</P>
<P>
   There is the potential for unconscionable tragedy here. One
hard-line Shiite cleric has said the 13 should be ``sentenced to
death _ not once but several times.''
</P>
<P>
   The source of such hysteria among the conservative clergy is not
the defendants but the Iranian people themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Reform candidates allied with President Mohammad Khatami swept
the preliminary elections and then, despite seeing 12 provincial
victories annulled by the Council of Guardians, went on to dominate
the recent runoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic Iran Participation Front won 79 percent of the vote,
52 of the contested 66 legislative seats.
</P>
<P>
   That is an overwhelming mandate in any republic, as Iran claims
to be despite its ``Islamic'' modifier. The legitimacy of that
claim hangs in the balance as the hard-line ayatollahs decide
whether they want to take the risks that would go with voiding a
hugely popular democratic outcome or cede some level of power
through a peaceful, electoral transition.
</P>
<P>
   The rattled clerics are deciding, too, whether they want to take
Iran out of the world community. Its place there already tenuous,
Iran would become even more widely anathematized and more deeply
isolated as a theocracy that suppresses manifest popular will and
toys with judicial murder.

 &HT;    OSHA WEIGHING PLAN TO RESHAPE THE AMERICAN WORKPLACE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, May 14.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Workers at the 911 center in Rochester, N.Y., used
to respond to emergency calls while seated in stiff chairs at
neck-straining work stations where lights glared down on their
computer screens. Almost 50 of the 119 employees reported serious
muscular problems. Nine required surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Then the city built a new facility. Planners consulted employees
and installed chairs with special back supports and consoles with
adjustable lifts for monitors and keyboards. Each worker was given
controls for light, heat and air conditioning, not to mention a
switch to supply soothing ``white noise.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years after the center opened, claims for work-related
injuries have plummeted. Only one worker injury was reported in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Such success stories are at the heart of a long-simmering
national debate over whether employers should be required to follow
federal mandates on ``ergonomics,'' which means making workplaces
fit the workers. The goal is to prevent common on-the-job injuries
from repetitive action or over-exertion.
</P>
<P>
   A move by the Clinton administration to set ergonomics standards
reached its final phase last week as the Labor Department's
Occupational Safety and Health Administration wrapped up public
hearings on a rule that would cover 27 million working Americans.
</P>
<P>
   As of early May, OSHA had heard from 1,000 witnesses in hearings
held in Portland, Ore.; Chicago and Washington, and the agency had
a stack of more than 25,000 pages of public comments.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the nation's businesses would be affected, including
poultry plants, hospitals, package delivery services, mom and pop
grocery stores and funeral homes _ every sector except agriculture,
construction and maritime. Not surprisingly, hundreds of employers
are battling the new regulation, even as unions are urge its
adoption.
</P>
<P>
   Employers and their backers on Capitol Hill are offering three
chief objections:
</P>
<P>
   _ Mandating ergonomics programs and standards would cost
billions more than the government estimates, they say. Although
OSHA has pegged the cost to industry at $4.2 billion a year,
business coalitions have put the cost as high as $100 billion
annually.
</P>
<P>
   A detailed analysis for the Food Distributors International,
which represents warehouses, concluded that the rule would cost its
members $26 billion a year. Even the U.S. Small Business
Administration reports that business expenses will be several times
as much as OSHA is predicting.
</P>
<P>
   _ Government regulation is unnecessary, the foes say, since
repetitive stress injuries have sharply declined since 1994 without
new rules. For example, carpal tunnel syndrome cases, traced to
repetitive movements, have dropped by 31 percent over five years,
according to the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scientific evidence is too unsettled to justify a rule now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a one-size-fits-all regulation that would deal equally
with a baker in Sacramento as it would with Dell Computers in
Austin or a bottling company in Peoria as well as a dance studio in
Miami,'' said Rep. Henry Bonilla, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla sponsored legislation to forbid OSHA from finalizing the
rule until the National Academy of Sciences has completed a
congressionally ordered study on ergonomics. His bill, which has
passed the House and now awaits Senate action, would delay
implementation until next year at the soonest.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmaker said he sees a ``race to the finish'' as the
administration tries to complete the rule before President Clinton
leaves office in January.
</P>
<P>
   Ergonomic regulation has long been a top priority for labor
unions, who say the benefits will outweigh the expenses. Among
their arguments:
</P>
<P>
   _ Ergonomics works, the proponents say, as evidenced by a 1997
study of five private companies by the U.S. General Accounting
Office, the investigative arm of Congress. The report concluded
that these employers reduced injuries and illnesses at modest cost
by applying the standards of ergonomics.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ergonomics programs can prevent many work-related
musculoskeletal disorders that currently cost employers as much as
$20 billion a year in compensation costs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Many workers have been seriously hurt while performing routine
duties that would be redesigned under the federal regulation.
</P>
<P>
   At the OSHA hearing last week, Rebekah Rice, a slightly built
registered nurse from Washington, hobbled into the Labor Department
room leaning on a cane. She was unable to sit because of pain.
</P>
<P>
   Tearfully she told how she had sustained a career-ending injury
when she tried with only one helper to move a 350-pound patient in
the intensive care ward. She said she could have been spared her
ordeal if the hospital had been required to have specialized ``lift
teams'' or mechanical lifting devices.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla acknowledged the power of such testimony, but countered
that ``we have to look at the big picture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the rules were implemented and they put a hardship on
hospitals, there's a real possibility that patients would go
unattended because they'd have to check with OSHA before they lift
a patient off a bed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The contrasting viewpoints are illustrated even by the case of
the Rochester 911 center. The American Federation of State, County
and Municipal Employees touts it as evidence that ergonomics
programs are effective and should be required by federal
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became a textbook case on how to do things right,'' said
Jim August, the union's assistant director of research.
</P>
<P>
   But the center's director, John Merklinger, is less certain
about a federal rule telling employers what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm cautious to say there should be a mandate,'' Merklinger
said. ``However, I clearly see the benefit since we've done it
here, and the money savings'' for reduced injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps they would be better spending the money on educating
business leaders about the benefits of an ergonomics program,'' he
said.

 &HT;    OSHA WEIGHING PLAN TO RESHAPE THE AMERICAN WORKPLACE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, May 14.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Workers at the 911 center in Rochester, N.Y., used
to respond to emergency calls while seated in stiff chairs at
neck-straining work stations where lights glared down on their
computer screens. Almost 50 of the 119 employees reported serious
muscular problems. Nine required surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Then the city built a new facility. Planners consulted employees
and installed chairs with special back supports and consoles with
adjustable lifts for monitors and keyboards. Each worker was given
controls for light, heat and air conditioning, not to mention a
switch to supply soothing ``white noise.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years after the center opened, claims for work-related
injuries have plummeted. Only one worker injury was reported in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Such success stories are at the heart of a long-simmering
national debate over whether employers should be required to follow
federal mandates on ``ergonomics,'' which means making workplaces
fit the workers. The goal is to prevent common on-the-job injuries
from repetitive action or over-exertion.
</P>
<P>
   A move by the Clinton administration to set ergonomics standards
reached its final phase last week as the Labor Department's
Occupational Safety and Health Administration wrapped up public
hearings on a rule that would cover 27 million working Americans.
</P>
<P>
   As of early May, OSHA had heard from 1,000 witnesses in hearings
held in Portland, Ore.; Chicago and Washington, and the agency had
a stack of more than 25,000 pages of public comments.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the nation's businesses would be affected, including
poultry plants, hospitals, package delivery services, mom and pop
grocery stores and funeral homes _ every sector except agriculture,
construction and maritime. Not surprisingly, hundreds of employers
are battling the new regulation, even as unions are urge its
adoption.
</P>
<P>
   Employers and their backers on Capitol Hill are offering three
chief objections:
</P>
<P>
   _ Mandating ergonomics programs and standards would cost
billions more than the government estimates, they say. Although
OSHA has pegged the cost to industry at $4.2 billion a year,

   PRACTICAL-MAN _ This week, the practical man has a promise to
keep. Be happy. It happened during a conversation with a reader.
This woman, peeved by his proclamation that males befriend only
attractive females, lingered at length over three pungent points:
The practical man is a) an insensitive idiot, b) an arrogant idiot
and c) merely an idiot. (Palm Beach Post). 40.

   METHODISTS _ CLEVELAND _ Daily coverage, as merits, of United
Methodist General Conference in Cleveland. Issues coming up this
week are same-sex blessing, a new TV ad campaign to rival the
Mormons, legislation apologizing for the denomination's past racism
and trying to raise a huge amount of money for historically black
Methodist colleges that include Clark Atlanta U., some
denominational reorganization, and possible resolutions on Elian
and gun control, to name a few. (GWhite, Atlanta

   GETAWAY _ LIVE OAK, Fla. _ It all started with bluegrass. Opened
in 1985, the Spirit of the Suwannee Music Park was founded by
lifelong bluegrass lovers Bill and Jean Cornett of Kentucky as a
place for Southern pickers and fiddlers to gather. Since then, it
has blossomed into a multi-use campground that hosts events of all
stripes, from traditional bluegrass festivals to hot-air balloon
races, gospel jubilees, auto shows and hippie-rock weekends.
Beginning with a huge Memorial Day blowout (coinciding with the
nearby Florida Folk Festival), this summer promises to be the
park's busiest yet. (Hamilton, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 35.

   COXNET TRAVEL 0509 -- There is a lot more than horses, whiskey
and baseball bats to the venerable river town of Louisville, Ky.
Although those ageless items make for a pretty good visit right off
the, um, bat. But just when you think you have Louisville pegged as
an old-timey, tradition-bound burg, it throws you a curve.
(Hulbert, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) Art includes a 4-column
color photo of tourists walking along the Ohio River and a 18-pica
color photo of a historic district.

Louisville.

<P>
   WITH: BOURBON DISTILLERY -- Jim Beam, the largest bourbon
distillery in the world, features a promotional film laced with
company propaganda and several good displays about the history and
process of the drink. More than anything you'll see there, it's
nice to smell the charred oak housed in huge warehouses. (Bierman,
Palm Beach Post) Art includes a 2-column color photo of tourists
visiting the distillery.

   FASHION-FRANCE _ PARIS _ What Switzerland is to timekeeping and
Great Britain is to ceremony, France is to fashion. The French
didn't simply write the book on style, they built the Library de la
Mode. Hermes, Chanel and Dior donated their design services. The
French language contributed entire sections to the global fashion
dictionary (see chamois, chapeau, chenille, chic, chiffon, chignon
...). (Sturrock, Palm Beach Post). 60. WITH PHOTOS.

<P>
   FASHION-ROWAN _ PARIS _ Lisa Rowan loves the convenience of Palm
Beach _ the always good-to-go weather, the discount retailers
stocked to the ceiling with everything a home needs, the beach just
down the street from her Chilian Avenue home. And she loves the
culture of Paris _ the art museums, the fragrant flower stalls, the
world-famous gardens and the flea markets practically at her back
door. So why choose between them? Rowan splits her time between the
two cities, jetting back and forth according to the school schedule
of her 6-year-old son, Krystofer Kimmel. Her career in the fashion
industry _ she calls herself a ``creative consultant'' _ has taken
Rowan around the globe. A Pennsylvania native, Rowan became
public-relations and advertising director for the late designer
Willi Smith shortly after college graduation. (Sturrock, Palm Beach
Post). 160. WITH PHOTOS.
</P>
<P>
   WITH ROWAN-SIDE _ PALM BEACH, Fla. _ What does it take to score
the perfect headboard or a dinette to die for? ``There's something
that clicks, and it's just destiny,'' says fashion consultant Lisa
Rowan, who has decorated her Palm Beach and Paris homes with
purchases from flea markets and thrift stores both here and abroad.
``I don't find anything. It finds me.'' (Sturrock, Palm Beach
Post). 25. WITH PHOTOS.

<P>
   FASHION-GIRLZONE _ There aren't any perfume samples to spritz at
the cosmetics counter, greasy slices of pizza to munch in the food
court, or cute boys to scam on at Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch. (Sturrock,
Palm Beach Post). 18.
</P>
<P>
   SWIMSUITS-ONEPIECE _ Designers have poured as much imagination
and innovation into one-piece styles this year as they have devoted
to bikinis and tankini looks in the past. (Walton, Atlanta

   COXNET LIFESTYLES 0510 -- The summer box-office battle started a

weeks ahead of the Memorial Day holiday. It's survival of the
fittest, funniest or most exciting, with billions of dollars at
stake. Here's a look at this summer's wide-release films. (Larson,

``Gladiator,'' a 1-column color photo from ``Battlefield Earth,'' a

   HAMILTON-JORDAN _ Twenty years ago, Hamilton Jordan was the
gatekeeper who controlled access to the most powerful man in the
country, a brash newcomer to Washington who moonlighted as
Georgetown's most notorious pubcrawler. Today, former President
Carter's chief-of-staff has no power than any other Little League
assistant coach. Between one life and another, he went through a
divorce, has survived cancer three times, run for the U.S. Senate
and lost, and gone from a thirtyish Beltway climber to a sedate
middle-aged father of three young children. In his book ``No Such
Thing As a Bad Day,'' Jordan reflects on the bumps in the road and
what he's learned in a life out of the public eye. We profile
Jordan at 55, a political has-been who believes he's never been
more alive. (Skube, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 45.

   BOOKS-SKUBE _ ``At the end, a nurse stripped the neck brace,
pressed her fingers against the carotid artery, and felt for the
faintest sign of a pulse. The Velcro made a sound like stitches
ripping.'' Rodger Kamenetz's remembrance of his mother in ``Terra
Infirma: A Memoir of My Mother's Life in Mine,'' originally
published by the University of Arkansas Press and reissued by
Shocken Books, is both tender and bittersweet, with none of the
false sentimentality of a Mother's Day card. In both its lyricism
and its emotional subtlety, it recalls Russell Baker's opening
sentence in ``Growing Up'': ``At the age of 80 my mother had her
last bad fall, and after that her mind wandered free through
time.'' Sons more often than daughters seem to hear a parent's
admonitory voice from beyond the grave, and seek redemption through
words that went unspoken when there was still time. But settling
accounts can be painful. Oscar Wilde's unsparing observation is
true in more instances than we like to acknowledge: ``Children
begin by loving their parents. After a time they judge them.
Rarely, if ever, do they forgive them.'' (Skube, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 23.

   COXNET BOOKS 0509 -- Until the collapse of the Soviet Union,
foreigners could visit only five towns along the Trans-Siberian
Railway, and then only under supervision. ``Siberia itself,''
Author Colin Thubron says, ``receded into rumor.'' In the late
summer of 1997, Thubron strapped on a 20-pound rucksack and set out
to experience ``a place where white cranes dance on the permafrost,
where a great city floats lost among the ice floes, where mammoths
sleep under glaciers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In Siberia'' (HarperCollins, $26) completes a trilogy that
Thubron began in 1983. (Skube, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) Art
includes a 3-column color photo of author Colin Thubron.

<P>
   WITH: REVIEW EXPLORERS -- Author David Roberts rates Kit Carson
ahead of John C. Fremont as both pathfinder and human being. Anyone
caring about Carson and Fremont may seem to have too much time to

names were known to every American. (Blackburn, Palm Beach Post)

   WITH: PUBLISHING NOTES -- I had hoped that Arthur Lennig's

   PRACTICAL-MAN _ This week, the practical man has a promise to
keep. Be happy. It happened during a conversation with a reader.
This woman, peeved by his proclamation that males befriend only
attractive females, lingered at length over three pungent points:
The practical man is a) an insensitive idiot, b) an arrogant idiot
and c) merely an idiot. (Palm Beach Post). 40.

   METHODISTS _ CLEVELAND _ Daily coverage, as merits, of United
Methodist General Conference in Cleveland. Issues coming up this
week are same-sex blessing, a new TV ad campaign to rival the
Mormons, legislation apologizing for the denomination's past racism
and trying to raise a huge amount of money for historically black
Methodist colleges that include Clark Atlanta U., some
denominational reorganization, and possible resolutions on Elian
and gun control, to name a few. (GWhite, Atlanta

   GETAWAY _ LIVE OAK, Fla. _ It all started with bluegrass. Opened
in 1985, the Spirit of the Suwannee Music Park was founded by
lifelong bluegrass lovers Bill and Jean Cornett of Kentucky as a
place for Southern pickers and fiddlers to gather. Since then, it
has blossomed into a multi-use campground that hosts events of all
stripes, from traditional bluegrass festivals to hot-air balloon
races, gospel jubilees, auto shows and hippie-rock weekends.
Beginning with a huge Memorial Day blowout (coinciding with the
nearby Florida Folk Festival), this summer promises to be the
park's busiest yet. (Hamilton, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 35.

   COXNET TRAVEL 0509 -- There is a lot more than horses, whiskey
and baseball bats to the venerable river town of Louisville, Ky.
Although those ageless items make for a pretty good visit right off
the, um, bat. But just when you think you have Louisville pegged as
an old-timey, tradition-bound burg, it throws you a curve.

   FASHION-FRANCE _ PARIS _ What Switzerland is to timekeeping and
Great Britain is to ceremony, France is to fashion. The French
didn't simply write the book on style, they built the Library de la
Mode. Hermes, Chanel and Dior donated their design services. The
French language contributed entire sections to the global fashion
dictionary (see chamois, chapeau, chenille, chic, chiffon, chignon
...). (Sturrock, Palm Beach Post). 60. WITH PHOTOS.

   FASHION-ROWAN _ PARIS _ Lisa Rowan loves the convenience of Palm
Beach _ the always good-to-go weather, the discount retailers
stocked to the ceiling with everything a home needs, the beach just
down the street from her Chilian Avenue home. And she loves the
culture of Paris _ the art museums, the fragrant flower stalls, the
world-famous gardens and the flea markets practically at her back
door. So why choose between them? Rowan splits her time between the
two cities, jetting back and forth according to the school schedule
of her 6-year-old son, Krystofer Kimmel. Her career in the fashion
industry _ she calls herself a ``creative consultant'' _ has taken
Rowan around the globe. A Pennsylvania native, Rowan became
public-relations and advertising director for the late designer
Willi Smith shortly after college graduation. (Sturrock, Palm Beach
Post). 160. WITH PHOTOS.

   WITH ROWAN-SIDE _ PALM BEACH, Fla. _ What does it take to score
the perfect headboard or a dinette to die for? ``There's something
that clicks, and it's just destiny,'' says fashion consultant Lisa
Rowan, who has decorated her Palm Beach and Paris homes with
purchases from flea markets and thrift stores both here and abroad.
``I don't find anything. It finds me.'' (Sturrock, Palm Beach

 BELFAST, Northern Ireland: ... ``Costa Del Provo.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But while some like Hughes say republicans have forgotten their
roots, Shane O'Doherty, who joined the IRA at 15 and served 15
years in prison for sending mail bombs that maimed people, thinks
it is time for the IRA to ``grow up'' and put behind them the
history that inspired them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just a problem for the IRA. A lot of armies have
had the same problem. Once at war, to reason is treason,'' said
O'Doherty, who renounced violence, got a degree from Trinity
College in Dublin, married an American, and is now a computer
consultant based in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   ``But times have changed. The IRA has to change with them,''
said O'Doherty. ``This talk of being mass-attacked and burned out
by loyalists is bull. The real issue is that a very small bunch of
totally unrepresentative people won't decommission their own sense
of self-importance. While people are whining about IRA pride and
IRA surrender and unionist stalling, real people somewhat removed
from the argument have died at the end of the bombs and guns.''
</P>
<P>
   The republicans have made a seismic shift in tactics. By
accepting the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, the movement, in the
name of Sinn Fein, has accepted the principle of consent, that
Northern Ireland will remain part of Britain until a majority
living here decide otherwise. They have, as IRA leader Michael
Collins did in 1922, accepted partition as a political reality that
they will have to reverse by the force of argument, not the
argument of force.
</P>
<P>
   Some say that Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, or Martin
McGuinness, the former IRA chief of staff who was the minister for
education in the short-lived power-sharing government, could become
the next Michael Collins, the last IRA leader to compromise with
the British. Collins was shot by IRA dissidents in 1922. There has
been graffitti in Belfast warning Adams to ``Remember Michael
Collins.''
</P>
<P>
   Over dinner at one of the posh restaurants that have sprung up
in Belfast since the 1994 cease-fire, a senior official of the
Royal Ulster Constabulary, admitted that, from a security
standpoint, the IRA's turning in some weapons, or sealing its
hidden arms dumps, is meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get the IRA to decommission their engineering
capabilities,'' said the officer, speaking on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   That officer and others say that besides being able to rearm as
quickly as it disarms, even if the IRA turned in its Semtex
explosives, it could still make bombs out of fertilizer, which it
has used to devastating effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't decommission all the cow shite in Ireland,'' said
one senior officer of the Garda Siochana.
</P>
<P>
   But those who say that disarming means little for security also
acknowledge it is essential as a confidence building measure in a
political culture that remains a study in mistrust.
</P>
<P>
   While Sinn Fein can influence the IRA, it cannot get the IRA to
do anything it does not want to, said O'Doherty and other former
and current IRA members.
</P>
<P>
   Most seasoned observers here believe that, despite their public
protestations to the contrary, if it was within their power to make
a token gesture of turning in some guns, Adams and McGuinness would
do it, not because they have gone soft, but because they have
already compromised on much more fundamental republican principles:
recognizing the legitimacy of Northern Ireland by entering the
assembly and, after the Omagh bombing, condemning the use of
violence by republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who say politics will produce a united Ireland
sooner than armed struggle have always been marginalized, derided
as sellouts who have gone soft. But the proponents of physical
force are undeniably in decline, and those who agree with Adams and
McGuinness are in the ascendancy.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of this is about human nature and insecurity, O'Doherty
says. The IRA is effectively being asked to put itself out of
business. Few organizations do that willingly. O'Doherty says
people who are willing to kill, die and go to prison for their
beliefs tend to be even less rational and pragmatic when asked to
compromise, let alone dissolve their organization.
</P>
<P>
   When Joe Doc, IRA legend, first broached the subject of a
cease-fire to let politics take precedence, the other IRA men on
his cellblock at Long Kesh prison hooted. Gradually, he and other
IRA leaders like Danny Morrison won them over. Now he, Morrison,
and others who believe the days of armed insurrection are
counterproductive are trying to hold the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear the (dissident) argument, but I say what is your
alternative? I don't like the process either,'' O'Doherty said. ``I
say we'll go back to war if you could tell me we'll move forward.
But I don't believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, in Ireland there is always someone who does.

IRA FIGHTS INTERNAL RIFTS OVER WEAPONS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST _ Dermot Finucane is an unlikely peacekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, the IRA man was a prison escapee, one of the most
wanted men in Ireland. After a Dublin court refused to extradite
him to Northern Ireland, he allegedly became chief of the Irish
Republican Army's ``southern command'' in the Irish Republic, where
most of the organization's weapons are stashed.
</P>
<P>
   These days, police on both sides of the border say, Finucane is
traveling regularly to southwest Ireland, where much of the IRA's
estimated arsenal of 50 machine guns, 600 assault rifles, 500
handguns, and nearly three tons of Semtex explosives is hidden in
underground caches that meld seamlessly into the lush countryside.
Police grudgingly give Finucane credit for keeping the IRA's arms
out of the hands of dissident hotheads.
</P>
<P>
   Since the IRA offered on Saturday to allow international
inspectors to check its arms dumps, part of a process it said was
aimed at putting the weapons ``beyond use,'' most attention in
London, Dublin, Washington, and other capitals has focused on
whether unionists will accept the IRA proposal. But a more
important long-term question is whether the IRA can sell the idea
to a large enough segment of its own members to avoid a split that
could wreck the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with IRA members, supporters, and security officials
on both sides of the Irish border suggest that the IRA offer, which
falls short of Protestant unionist demands for a handover of
weapons, was carefully calibrated to prevent a major split while
nudging the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Finucane's vigilance against potential
dissidents is necessary. ``We don't know whether he threatened
them, cajoled them or both, but whatever he's done has worked,''
said a detective with the antiterrorist branch of the Garda
Siochana, Ireland's national police force.
</P>
<P>
   According to British and Irish security sources, at least two of
the seven-member ruling IRA Army Council are so opposed to turning
in weapons that they have warned a bloody split would follow any
attempt to meet Protestant demands of guns up front before they
will rejoin a government with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over weapons has led not only to the suspension of
the local power-sharing government that was supposed to steer
Northern Ireland into a new, peaceful era. It has also bitterly
divided the IRA and raised the specter of mass defections to the
burgeoning splinter groups that have set off several explosions
recently. One of those groups planted the bomb that killed 29
people in Omagh in 1998, the biggest loss of life in Ireland's 30
years of Troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with a dozen current and former members of the IRA
suggest that behind the preoccupation with weapons is a fundamental
power struggle between the IRA, traditionally the dominant force in
the republican movement that seeks to wrest Northern Ireland away
from Britain, and Sinn Fein, which has traditionally been
subservient to the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-four years after the Easter Rising that they claim as
their mandate, and six years after they said they were prepared to
let their political representatives in Sinn Fein seek a united
Ireland through democratic politics, the IRA is at a crossroads. As
democracy begins to take root in Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein is on
the cusp of replacing the IRA as leaders of the republican
movement. That transfer in the balance of power, however, is not
proving to be a smooth one, and it has been made that much harder
because of the IRA's refusal to disarm and the unionist insistence
that it happen.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the IRA believe the effort to disarm them is really an
attempt to humiliate them and prove that they were terrorists all
along, not the freedom fighters they consider themselves to be.
While most in the IRA are sticking to their cease-fire, reluctantly
accepting the leadership's pleas to be patient, a growing number of
IRA volunteers are sliding over to the dissidents who argue that
the peace process is a trap that will leave Northern Ireland firmly
and permanently entrenched as part of the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Many are frustrated by what they consider the slow pace of
change in reforming the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Northern
Ireland's mostly Protestant police force, and in withdrawing the
14,000 British troops remaining in Northern Ireland. Several IRA
operatives claimed the growing international chorus demanding that
they at least say their war is over, if not actually turn in
weapons, makes that prospect less, not more, likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you push the IRA, the IRA pushes back ten times harder,''
said one IRA volunteer from South Armagh, the area controlled by
former IRA chief of staff Tom ``Slab'' Murphy, who security sources
and even some republican sources say is the leading skeptic on the
IRA's Army Council.
</P>
<P>
   But Murphy's skepticism, sources say, has been offset by Brian
Keenan, the IRA's Belfast commander who is widely regarded as the
most influential member of the Army Council. Keenan remains a firm
backer of Sinn Fein's strategy, according to security and
republican sources. It is Keenan, they say, who has pushed hardest
for keeping the IRA's weapons locked up and under international
scrutiny rather than turning them in or destroying them, which most
IRA members would view as an act of surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Some IRA men cannot fathom life without the IRA. And if they
give up their guns, then there is no IRA. Some of them have accused
others of ``going soft,'' a volatile charge in a movement where
macho defiance is admired and the disloyal are beaten or summarily
executed.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Doherty is one who has felt the sting of that charge.
</P>
<P>
   If there were an IRA hall of fame, Joe Doherty would be in it.
Thirty years ago, after watching the overwhelmingly Protestant
local police stand by while his Catholic New Lodge neighborhood was
overrun and torched by pro-British loyalists, he joined the IRA at
the age of 15.
</P>
<P>
   He fired the shot that killed the most senior member of the
British Army's elite SAS commando unit to die in Northern Ireland,
and made a daring escape from custody the day before he was
sentenced to life for it. He was eventually arrested in New York,
where he was posing as a bartender, and his 9-year fight against
extradition made him a cause celebre. When he was finally
extradited in 1992, Doherty arrived home to a hero's welcome and a
prison cell. There are few IRA living legends bigger than Joe Doc,
as he is known in the republican enclaves of his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   But one of his childhood friends stopped him on the street the
other day and called him a traitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ahhh,'' Doherty said, wincing and sighing heavily in the
office where he and other ex-prisoners are training to become youth
workers. As one of the leading proponents of ending the ``armed
struggle'' to allow politics to take precedence, Doherty finds it
hard when some old comrades accuse him of selling out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard times. People are upset, scared, angry, turning on
each other. No one knows where this thing is going.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing'' is the peace process, which has delivered a
remarkable degree of normalcy to Northern Ireland after 30 years of
virtual civil war.
</P>
<P>
   On the gritty streets that Joe Doc returned to upon his release
from prison 18 months ago, few say the IRA should go back to war,
but even fewer think they should give up their guns. Ordinary
people fear attacks like the ones of 1969 that inspired Doherty to
join the IRA in the first place, and remain unconvinced that the
police force that stood by 30 years ago and remains 90 percent
Protestant has fundamentally changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm constantly stopped on the street by older people who say
don't give up the guns. It's not about going back to war. It's
about protection,'' said Doherty.
</P>
<P>
   Some IRA fighters, called Provos because they belong to the
Provisional IRA, have become cynical. Brendan ``Darkie'' Hughes is,
like Doherty, an IRA legend, having shot, bombed, and escaped his
way into republican folklore. But unlike Doherty, he does not
support the peace process. He thinks some republicans have sold out
for the trappings of success, like new cars and vacation homes in
Donegal, where they can spend weekends pretending to live in a free
country. Cynics call Donegal ``Costa Del Provo.''

MOTHER'S DAY AND THE OTHER MOTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For many stepmothers, Mother's Day is something to dread, a day
full of disappointment and hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Not for Niah Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   For most mothers whose children also have a stepmother, Mother's
Day is a time to forget about the other woman in your children's
lives and revel in their exclusive attention.
</P>
<P>
   Not for Vivian Smith-Benton.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia and Smith-Benton have two things in common: Jaheem
Smith-Garcia, who is 9, and Nyiema Smith-Garcia, 13. Smith-Benton
is their mother. Garcia became their stepmother three years ago
when she married their dad, Naheem Allah-Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   On Mother's Day, Jaheem and Nyiema will have a card and gift for
their mother that their stepmother helped them buy, and a card and
gift for their stepmother that their mother helped them buy.
</P>
<P>
   This generosity of spirit is not something the two women have
ever talked about; it's evolved because both were able to see past
their own needs and make the children their priority.
</P>
<P>
   There's no better time to do it than on Mother's Day. While this
may be a day intended to honor mothers, in families reconfigured
through divorce and remarriage children can get caught in
destructive fallout.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Child's perspective
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From a child's perspective, there's no reason to honor a
stepmother on Sunday. ``This is Mother's Day, not Stepmother's
Day,'' says Perdita Kirkness Norwood, a stepmother advocate and
author of ``The Enlightened Stepmother'' (Avon, 1999). ``You may be
a mother to them but you are not the mother. It's foolish to expect
to be remembered,'' she tells stepmothers.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, a typical stepmother anticipates something. ``She
spends the day hoping for a card, waiting for a phone call, or
crying alone,'' says Norwood.
</P>
<P>
   When a stepmother isn't remembered, she tends to harbor a hurt
that indirectly affects her household. Perhaps she puts unusual
distance between herself and the kids the next time she sees them,
or she's short with them or critical. They have no idea why this is
happening and react negatively in return. Suddenly, relationships
that may have been tenuous at best are out of control.
</P>
<P>
   It's also neither uncommon nor unhealthy for a stepmother to
take her hurt to her husband, says psychologist and researcher
Patricia Papernow. Unfortunately, ``When we're unhappy, we tend not
to be very gracious,'' she says. ``Instead of, `I've been sad ever
since Mother's Day,' we say, `Your kids didn't remember me! How
could you let that happen to me?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, ``no parent can hear that without getting
defensive,'' she says. Instead of a response that makes a
stepmother feel better _ ``I appreciate everything you do for my
kids'' _ she gets one that makes her feel more isolated: `They're
just kids; you're the grown-up. It's your problem, not theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a father and children whose stepmother criticized
them last year for ignoring her won't necessarily have learned the
lesson she expects, says Norwood. ``Instead of doing something for
her, they'll just think that whatever they plan for Mom needs to be
done furtively,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that stepchildren are cruel. ``They're in a loyalty
bind,'' says Papernow, who specializes in remarried families.
</P>
<P>
   She says children of all ages, especially at the beginning of a
father's remarriage but even years afterward, feel protective of
the relationship with their biological mother. ``They think, `If I
move toward my stepmother, I have betrayed my mother,' '' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they have a close and loving relationship with a
stepmother; even if they live primarily with their stepmother and
father; even if their biological mother is abusive, Mother's Day is
a huge symbolic line that's difficult to cross.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Norwood urges stepmothers not to take it personally
if you're not remembered. ``This is not about you,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Doing whatever helps
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps surprising, what helps stepmothers most is helping the
children. And what children need most is permission to deal with
the reality of their lives, says Margorie Engel, president of the
Stepfamily Association of America. In other words, she says, ``make
it easy for the kids.'' For instance:
</P>
<P>
   --Model for them. Talk about what you're doing for your mother
and ask what they have in mind for theirs.
</P>
<P>
   --Offer to be helpful: ``Do you need a ride to get a card?''
``Do you like to make gifts? I once made a great jewelry box for my
mother out of a cigar box. I could show you how.''
</P>
<P>
   --Offer to rearrange schedules. ``You're supposed to be at our
house that weekend, but I bet it'd be fun for your mom if you woke
up at her house Mother's Day morning . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only does this help kids with their reality _ `I do need
something for Mom' _ but it eliminates conflict for them and gives
them permission to like you as a person. In addition, it helps you
feel less like a victim, '' says Engel. If you don't see immediate
benefits from doing this, you will in years to come. ``They will be
grateful you gave them space to love you both rather than try to
pretend about or deny their mother's role,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Children who need the most help on Mother's Day are those whose
mother has died. ``You know kids are thinking about their mom on
this day. Get it out in the open,'' says Engel.
</P>
<P>
   If it's the first year the stepfamily is together, she
recommends saying, ``I bet Mother's Day is tough for you. Is there
something you would like to do to remember your mom?'' Some
possibilities: visiting the grave, drawing pictures, telling
stories of Mother's Days when their mom was alive.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be hurt if they want to do something with their dad,
without you, says Norwood, who wishes she had had advice like this
when she first became a stepmother to three teenage girls and one
boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pretended Mother's Day wasn't happening. We ignored it,''
she says. ``That was a mistake. I wish we had talked about their
mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, helping children deal with their reality means mom
gives them permission to thank their stepmother, says Papernow. For
instance: ``You know, Stephanie does so many nice things for you
all year long. Mother's Day might be a nice time to let her know
you appreciate it.''
</P>

   Fathers can do that too, but it's trickier. ``If you push too
hard, it can feel (like you are encouraging them to be) disloyal,''
says Papernow. Recommend a thank-you note, not a Mother's Day card,
suggest but don't insist. On the other hand, Papernow does urge
fathers to express their own gratitude on Mother's Day: ``I know
how much you do for my kids. Thank you.'' Papernow is the author of
``Becoming a Stepfamily'' (Analytic Press).

   Vivian Smith-Benton has managed not to be jealous of or angry
about the relationship her children have with their stepmother
partly because of her work as visitation project coordinator for
the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court. ``I've seen the damage
when parents aren't cooperative. That's not what I want for my
kids,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Does she ever feel things have gone too far, for instance when
Garcia makes it a threesome at parent-teacher conferences, or when
Jaheem calls Garcia ``Mami'' (Spanish for mommy)?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' she says, adding, ``I hope I'm as good a
stepmother to Tyrell,'' her husband's 13-year-old son from a
previous marriage.
</P>
<P>
   For Garcia, stepparenting comes almost naturally. ``I had two
brothers from my father's first marriage,'' she says. ``The word
`step' was never used. They were just my brothers.' '' She began
her relationship with Jaheem and Nyiema with the most positive
attitude possible: ``To me, they were the children in my life,
never a task to deal with. I'm blessed to have them.''
</P>
<P>
   She's also blessed now with a baby, 11-month-old Alenah. ``Just
before the baby was born, Jaheem asked if I would love her more
than him,'' she remembers. ``I told him, `Everyone you love, you
love in a little bit different way. You don't love your mommy the
same as you love me, do you? But you still love me, right? I'll
love her and I'm still going to love you.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to understand why he voluntarily makes her a homemade
Mother's Day card every year.

SUGGESTIONS FOR STEPMOTHERS &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Asking your stepchildren ``Did your mom have a nice Mother's
Day?'' helps them bring their two worlds together.
</P>
<P>
   --It's not unusual for one stepchild to remember you and another
not to. Don't make a big deal out of it.
</P>
<P>
   --Some children may resent it if you encourage remembering their
dead mother on Mother's Day. Say you are doing it for yourself:
``I'm going to light this candle on Mother's Day for your mother. I
want to remember her because she birthed you.''
</P>
<P>
   --If you've experienced sadness on previous Mother's Days, make
a plan for yourself or tell your husband, ``Mother's Day makes me
feel sad and lonely. Can we plan something?''
</P>
<P>
   --It's not appropriate to tell your stepchildren you were sad on
Mother's Day because they didn't remember you.
</P>
<P>
   --Even if you have been remembered by your stepchildren in the
past, don't assume it will automatically happen again. Children do
not feel the same sense of obligation to a stepmother, plus their
feelings toward you are more likely to be capricious and depend on
your last interaction.

MANAGING MOM? DON'T KID YOURSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``How To Manage Your Mother''?
</P>
<P>
   I gave up trying to manage my mother years ago when it finally
dawned on me that it's folly to think you can manage anyone else,
maybe especially your mother.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the title of this book was irresistible. Would it
reveal some arcane secret of mother management hitherto unknown to
the general public? It didn't, of course, but it's an intelligent,
accessible book about, as the subtitle states, ``Understanding the
Most Difficult, Complicated, and Fascinating Relationship in Your
Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as a dustjacket blurb from writer/actor Stephen Fry puts it,
``Does for mothers what Dian Fossey did for gorillas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The title is ironic,'' said the book's co-author, Alyce Faye
Cleese, from New York, where she was promoting the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secret of managing your mother is learning to manage
yourself in your relationship with your mother.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, it's crucial to reexamine the fundamental ways in
which you think about your mother. One example: try to think about
her as another adult, with a past that didn't always involve you,
instead of ``my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleese, a psychotherapist who is married to actor John Cleese,
interviewed celebrities and civilians about their relationships
with their mothers. She and co-author Brian Bates wove the stories
into the book's self-help format. Readers with demanding mothers
may take comfort in learning that Colin Powell had to make
Brigadier General before his mother would give him credit for
achieving anything. Those with ``martyr'' mothers might be
interested to know that Mike Nichols' famous funny line, ``Hello,
Michael. This is your mother. Remember me?'' was taken straight
from his not-so-funny relationship with his mother. Keeping a sense
of humor about your mother, or trying to, is one of the keys to
mother management, says Cleese. But you probably know that.
</P>
<P>
   She recommends talking with your mother about your shared past.
``Memory can be very tricky,'' she said. ``We lock in memories over
a lifetime and they shape our attitudes toward our mothers. But
memories are malleable. And when we reexamine them, deconstruct
them, talk about them, our feelings about our mothers may change.
And that can make an enormous difference in how we get along with
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Adult children need to remember that their mothers will not be
around forever. It's important to make the most of your time
together, Cleese said, by enjoying a good relationship with her or
trying to improve a bad one. ``Remember your mother's age,'' she
writes, ``Say the things you want to say while you have the
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   And if those things you want to say aren't positive? Cleese said
it's important to confront your mother about conflicts and try to
resolve them before she dies.
</P>
<P>
   Even after she's gone, it's possible to deepen your
understanding of your mother and improve the relationship, Cleese
said. ``In a sense, our mother never leaves us,'' she said. ``Our
mothers stay with us emotionally for the rest of our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleese was 16 when her mother died. She remembers her as a
loving woman, a memory that has made her feel secure. ``She was
lots of fun, she left me with such gifts,'' she said. Not long ago,
a friend of her mother's, a woman in her 90s, sent Cleese a long
letter about her mother. ``She wrote, `I want you to know that your
mother was really as wonderful as you remember her,'' Cleese said.
``It meant the world to me.''

ATTENTION GROWS ON INTERNET FRAUD AS ONLINE AUCTION SITE CANCELS 
PAINTING SALE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By SAUL HANSELL and JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EBay, the online auction house, Wednesday canceled the sale of
an abstract painting to a Dutch computer executive for $135,805,
contending that the seller, Kenneth A. Walton, who listed the item
under the name ``golfpoorly,'' had violated its rules in a way that
artificially inflated the sale price.
</P>
<P>
   The company also suspended three accounts that Walton used to
trade art, accusing him of ``shill bidding,'' meaning that he
entered bids on his own sales. In a phone interview, Walton, a
Sacramento lawyer, acknowledged placing bids on his own objects,
but said he had done so for friends and hadn't realized he had
violated the site's rules.
</P>
<P>
   The recent episode, in which bidding started at a quarter and
was propelled by hints that the painting was by the modern master
Richard Diebenkorn, sheds light on the exponential growth of
chicanery and fraud in Internet auctions, where tens of millions of
people spend billions of dollars a year for everything from modern
art to stuffed zebras.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet auctions remains the number one source of consumer
complaints related to their problems online and they vie with
sweepstakes for the top source of fraud overall,'' said Paul Luehr,
the supervisor of the Federal Trade Commission's Internet marketing
unit. Complaints about Internet auctions increased hundred-fold in
the last two years to 10,700 cases in 1999, outstripping even the
rapid growth of the auctions themselves.
</P>
<P>
   That represents 15 percent of all complaints the FTC has
compiled from a network of 240 law enforcement and consumer
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The open nature of auction sites like eBay, which let anyone
list an item for a fee of 25 cents to $2, has spawned a wide range
of scams. The most common involve ``sellers'' who receive payments
and never ship the promised goods. In other cases, the items sold
are damaged or otherwise not as described.
</P>
<P>
   But Luehr said a growing number of cases involve rare
collectible items, from baseball cards to photographs, that are
outright forgeries. The items most often are priced at a few
hundred dollars each, although there are dozens of cases where
sellers have defrauded dozens of buyers and made off with $10,000
to $75,000, said Robert Chesnut, eBay's associate general counsel
and a former federal prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Both Luehr and Chesnut say they have seen few formal complaints
about fine art. But many art dealers say that cases of fake art in
online auctions are multiplying, and that most of the sellers have
avoided prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``EBay is one of the greatest avenues for selling questionable
merchandise that's ever been invented,'' said Alan Bamberger, a
private dealer in books and art. ``I go on eBay from time to time
and it only takes me 20 minutes to a half hour to find a scammer.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing others who have followed the sales, he said that when
someone gets caught, ``they say, `I'm so sorry and return the
money.'' Most likely, he added, they put the item back up for sale
until they find an a buyer who doesn't check it out.''
</P>
<P>
   The auction sites say that fraud represents a tiny fraction of
their sales. EBay, the largest auction site, says that one-tenth of
1 percent of its auctions involve fraud. But in the first three
months of the year, eBay held 53.6 million auctions on which $1.15
billion worth of goods were sold. That implies that some 50,000
eBay auctions involved fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can look at it and say there were 50,000 cases of fraud,''
said Chesnut, ``but there are a lot of companies that would love to
have only one-tenth of 1 percent of their customers to have a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo and Amazon.com, which run the second and third largest
auction sites, don't release figures but they each handle millions
of auctions a month.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Blackburn, the general manager of Amazon's auctions, said
the total cases of fraud have been ``minuscule.''
</P>
<P>
   For inexpensive items, which represent the vast bulk of the
online auction sales, the buyers are only modestly at risk. EBay
offers an insurance policy covering $200 in fraud loss with a $25
deductible. Amazon offers up to $1,000 in fraud coverage with no
deductible.
</P>
<P>
   Chesnut also said that big ticket fraud was a relatively small
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see much fraud on the larger dollar items because
people are more careful,'' he said. ``You're not going to send a
check for $130,000 and wait for a painting to appear in the mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, stories of fake art for sale online are widespread
</P>
<P>
   Edan Hughes, a California dealer who buys and sells artwork on
the web, said he recently bought what was described as an oil
painting for $9,000. But he received a print instead. ``I fought
them and they gave me my money back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Valiquette, spokesman for the New York office of the FB
I, said that its art theft squad is investigating a handful of
cases involving the use of Internet auction sites as a forum to
sell items that turn out to be fake paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Such activity would violate federal statutes prohibiting mail
fraud, wire fraud and transportation of stolen property across
state lines.
</P>
<P>
   For more expensive items, auction sites take no responsibility
and buyers take the risk of fraud. One potential source of
protection for buyers is that the auction sites let their members
rate the performance of both buyers and sellers, creating a
self-policing mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   But there are flaws in this approach, art dealers say. For
example, many users say they live in a tit-for-tat culture, that
leads some Web site members who have received negative ratings to
retaliate by placing negative reviews on their detractors.
Sometimes, good reviews are posted by friends, and in any case, by
people who may not be able to spot fakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get a good rating, all a seller has to do is respond on
time, pack the goods on time and ship on time,'' Bamberger said.
``Then you get good feedback.''
</P>
<P>
   In another attempt to combat fraud for more expensive items,
several of the online auction sites have high-end sections that
guarantee the authenticity of the items sold. EBay has a service
called Great Collections it operates in conjuction with
Butterfield, the San Francisco auction house it bought. And Amazon
has a similar service in conjuction with Sotheby's and a network of
art dealers approved by Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   Blackburn of Amazon said that the majority of the high-end art
on its site is sold through the Sotheby's section.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think our users feel more comfortable buying art vetted by
a dealer,'' he said. Buyers on that portion of the site, however,
must pay a 10 percent fee in return for the guarantee. On Amazon's
regular auctions, as on eBay's, the seller pays a fee of between 1
and 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The sites say they fight fraud in other ways. EBay, for example,
keeps a list of people it has suspended and tries to keep them from
coming back onto the site using new names. A spokesman for the
company refused to say how many people have been suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Walton, a 32-year-old bachelor, attracted attention through a
provocative listing in which he falsely portrayed himself as a
married man who was offering a painting that had been damaged by
his son's plastic tricycle and that his wife banished to the
garage. While never portraying it as a Diebenkorn, the listing
provoked speculation by displaying the signature ``R.D. '52'' in a
photograph of a part of the painting, which used the same palette
that Diebenkorn employed in the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The auction was won by Rob Keereweer of the Netherlands. On
Tuesday, he and Walton agreed to void the sale if an expert
determined the painting was by someone other than Diebenkorn and
Keereweer did not want it anymore. Because of eBay's actions
Wednesday, Keereweer has no obligation to go through with the
purchase. Keereweer could not be reached for comment Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   But some eBay-watchers say eBay does not take reports of fakes
seriously enough. David Carlson, of the Carlson Gallery in Carmel.,
Calif., said he called eBay on Monday before the auction for
Walton's painting closed. ``I asked for the fraud division a half
dozen times,'' he said. ``The girl on the switchboard refused to
put me through. Instead, she went to golfpoorly's offer. She read
it and said, `I don't see any fraud here.' She made the decision
right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Purslove, an eBay spokesman, said that in general eBay
would not remove an item unless the complainant could offer solid
proof. ``Then we contact the seller and raise the question,'' he
said. ``We don't remove something on someone's word.''
</P>
<P>
   Many art dealers say such cases will continue, even if the sites
and law enforcement officials pay more attention to online art
fraud. That is because there is a growing group of art buyers who
want to use the Internet to build their collections on their own,
bypassing art dealers, just as many online day traders are avoiding
stock brokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These collectors think they can be one-up on the auction
houses and dealers and they want to buy first and not pay for the
expertise,'' said Joel Garzoli, who owns the Garzoli Gallery in San
Rafael, Calif., with his father John Garzoli. ``They are paying
substantial sums for paintings that have no value.''

HOUSE BILL WOULD PREVENT STATES FROM TAXING INTERNET USE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LIZETTE ALVAREZ    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a Republican bid to woo the high-technology
industry and please taxpayers, the House on Wednesday rushed to the
floor and then handily passed a bill to extend the current
moratorium on new Internet taxes until 2006.
</P>
<P>
   The moratorium, which is due to expire in October 2001, forbids
states from trying to find new ways of taxing Internet use, like
imposing taxes on monthly access charges for Internet service
providers.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation passed Wednesday, which faces an uncertain
future in the Senate, does not directly address the question of
sales taxes; it would not stop states from trying to collect taxes
for goods sold on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   By failing to address sales taxes, however, the measure alarmed
some state governments and traditional retailers, who say they have
found it nearly impossible to collect taxes for goods sold online.
</P>
<P>
   ``The single largest contributor to our economic prosperity has
been the growth of information technology _ the Internet,'' said
Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio. ``Why would we try to tax something, why
would we try to abuse something, why would we try to limit
something that generates unprecedented growth, wealth, opportunity
and unprecedented individual power?''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the bill say the moratorium, while seemingly benign,
ignores the thorny question of how state and local governments can
best collect taxes on the billions of dollars of merchandise sold
over the Internet each year. These taxes are expected to provide a
crucial future source of revenue for states, especially as more
consumers buy goods online.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's opponents _ a consortium of retailers, small-business
groups and governors _ say that consumers who buy merchandise over
the Internet can easily circumvent the patchwork of sales and
``use'' taxes that would be collected automatically if the same
merchandise were bought at a bricks-and-mortar retail store.
</P>
<P>
   The National Governors' Association is working on the best way
to collect electronic sales tax. Some estimates have put the loss
in sales tax revenue to the states at $8 billion a year by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers and small businesses have complained that the current
system unfairly places at a disadvantage traditional retailers that
do not sell their wares online and must charge sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to imagine how these kinds of losses can affect
state and local governments' ability to provide essential
services,'' said Rep. William Delahunt, D-Mass., citing the
concerns of many Republican governors. ``They will be compelled to
cut back local services or raise income taxes or property taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill even drew criticism from a few Republicans. Rep. Ernest
Istook of Oklahoma circulated a letter stating, ``The Internet
should not be singled out to be taxed, nor to be freed from tax.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the House voted overwhelmingly, 352 to 75, to pass the
bill. A number of Democrats approved the measure after they
received assurance that Congress would hold hearings on the
question of sales taxes and would try to come up with a solution.
</P>
<P>
   The moratorium ``has absolutely nothing to do with the sales tax
_ we will have the opportunity to have that debate,'' said Rep.
Robert Goodlatte, R-Va.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill faces a murkier future in the Senate. Sen. John
McCain, chairman of the Commerce Committee, who advocates a
permanent tax moratorium, canceled a hearing on the bill last month
after Republican senators, some of them former governors, expressed
reservations about the extension of the moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also faces opposition from the Clinton
administration, which signaled support Wednesday for a two-year
moratorium. The full House Wednesday rejected a two-year extension
in a separate vote.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, the likely Republican presidential nominee,
has said he would support an extension of the moratorium. But the
governor must tread carefully around the issue because Texas, which
does not have a state income tax, would stand to lose substantial
revenue if sales taxes are not made workable on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Al Gore said the vice president supported a
two-year extension of the moratorium ``at a minimum.'' If a
five-year moratorium is put into place, ``it should include
flexibility'' to adjust federal policies on Internet taxation ``to
take into account the fast-paced change in the Internet world.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   While American courts struggle over the recording industry's
challenge to digital music swapping, Ian Clarke, a 23-year-old
Irish programmer, is moving on to the next battleground. He is
finishing a program that he claims will make it impossible to
control the traffic in any kind of digital information _ whether it
is music, video, text or software.
</P>
<P>
   His program, known as Freenet, is intended to make it possible
to acquire or exchange such material anonymously while frustrating
any attempt to remove the information from the Internet or
determine its source.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke and his group of programmers have deliberately set
themselves on a collision course with the world's copyright laws.
They express the hope that the clash over copyright enforcement in
cyberspace will produce a world in which all information is freely
shared. In any case, the new programs could change the basic terms
of the discussion about intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   The swapping of music files over the Internet, through services
with names like Napster and MP3.com, has already raised the hackles
and mobilized the lawyers of the recording industry and some
musicians, who say the practice amounts to piracy. They hope either
to halt the services or to collect royalties on the digital works
being swapped.
</P>
<P>
   But programs now emerging make it possible to find and acquire
files without reference to a central database, and thus provide no
single target for aggrieved copyright holders. And methods being
developed to protect such works _ like scrambling the data and
requiring a key to decode it _ may wind up being trumped by similar
encryption that covers the tracks of those doing the swapping.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this whole thing catches on,'' Clarke remarked, ``I think
that people will look back in 20 to 40 years and look at the idea
that you can own information in the same way as gold or real estate
in the same way we look at witch-burning today.''
</P>
<P>
   The groups and companies pursuing the new distribution
technologies _ programs that in effect create vast digital
libraries spread across potentially hundreds of thousands of large
and small computers _ do not necessarily share Clarke's ideological
viewpoint. They range from iMesh, an Israeli-American start-up
company that aspires to become an international commercial digital
distribution system, to several small groups of free software
developers intent on building new systems for the sharing of any
kind of digital information.
</P>
<P>
   Some contend that if their software lends itself to copyright
infringement, it is the user's responsibility, not theirs. Clarke,
putting into practice a view expressed by many in the free-software
movement, takes the more extreme position that copyright protection
is simply obsolete in the Internet era.
</P>
<P>
   The test version of his Freenet program _ written in England and
now distributed free to many countries around the world _ was
posted on the World Wide Web in March.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke, who lives in London and works for a small electronic
commerce company, said last week in a telephone interview that
there had been more than 15,000 downloads of the early versions of
his product, indicating that hundreds or perhaps thousands of
network servers on the Web were already running the program.
</P>
<P>
   Any file that any user wants to offer to others can be made
available through the system. So far, that includes software
programs, video pornography and a copy of George Orwell's ``1984.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarke said he was confident that corporations trying to develop
complex technologies to encrypt information or otherwise halt the
free sharing of computer data will ultimately fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two words for these companies: give up,'' he said.
``There is no way they are going to stop these technologies. They
are trying to plug holes in a dam that is about to burst.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude, plus the fact that millions of users have come to
rely on easy access to digital information via the Internet,
suggests that the issue may quickly outstrip the current debate
over copyright infringement between the recording industry
association and a variety of Internet music distributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no shortage of gray hairs from worrying about these
programs,'' said Talal Shamoon, a Silicon Valley executive who
heads the Secure Digital Music Initiative, a technology and
entertainment industry working group.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts believe that the intellectual property laws
are being used in an effort to grapple with technologies they were
never intended to address.
</P>
<P>
   ``Copyright law is not the right tool in the case of many of the
new technologies,'' said Pamela Samuelson, a digital technology and
copyright expert at the laws school of the University of California
at Berkeley. ``The question will quickly become whether other
governments have reasons to try to regulate these new systems or
whether the U.S. government has the ability to regulate them.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials are only beginning to wrestle with the
implications of new technologies that will permit the anonymous,
instant, global distribution of information of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're obviously looking at all of these,'' said Christopher
Painter, deputy chief of the Justice Department's computer crime
and intellectual property section. ``It makes our job more
difficult and makes it harder to find the people who are
perpetrating crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Freenet, which Clarke conceived while he was an undergraduate at
the University of Edinburgh, is intended to function without any
centralized control point. ``Freenet is a near-perfect anarchy,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Internet digital distribution program, Gnutella, created
by software developers at the Nullsoft subsidiary of America
Online, has the same distributed approach employed by Freenet,
meaning that there is no central directory of what information the
system contains.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Napster, which is limited to digital music files,
Gnutella makes it possible to distribute video, software and text
documents as well.
</P>
<P>
   America Online declared Gnutella an ``unauthorized freelance
project'' in March, just hours after it was made available on the
Internet. But since its developers made its code freely available,
independent programmers have continued to refine Gnutella even
though the project was officially canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Many computer industry executives contend that if the recording
industry's suit against Napster succeeds, it will simply lead
digital-music enthusiasts to use alternatives, like Gnutella and
Freenet, which are even less open to copyright enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``So are all the musicians and record companies going to
continue their suits against Napster?'' a Gnutella user who
identified himself as Panicst8 wrote in a recent network posting.
``It seems kind of pointless, or have they just not figured out yet
that Gnutella is about 10,000 times more effective at locating what
you want?''
</P>
<P>
   Freenet goes several steps beyond Gnutella in an effort to
protect the anonymity of those who publish or copy information
electronically. It encrypts each file and scrambles the key _
actually a long number _ needed to find the file within the system.
And Freenet incorporates a digital ``immune system'' that responds
to any effort to determine the location of a piece of information
by spreading the information elsewhere in the network.
</P>
<P>
   Freenet relies on a system of volunteers who run the program on
network computers, or servers, Clarke said, and it will even be
difficult for the operators of individual parts of the network to
determine which computer holds any particular file.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, at least, copyright holders can take comfort
from the fact that Freenet is more efficient at obscuring the
source of information than at helping users find it. Clarke has not
yet built a search capability into the system, so users must find
other ways to let one another know how to retrieve files.
</P>
<P>
   And technologists like Shamoon say systems like Freenet present
a challenge, but not an insurmountable one. In addition to his
industry role with the Secure Digital Music Initiative, Shamoon is
senior vice president for media at the InterTrust Technologies
Corp., a Silicon Valley company that builds systems for protecting
intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   He cites the possibility of the transmission of viruses and
other harmful programs as being one of the obvious risks inherent
in electronic communities where no basis for trust inherently
exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a trust standpoint, the current generation of tools such
as Gnutella and Freenet are a nightmare for the same reason that
badly constructed social communities are a nightmare,'' Shamoon
said. The recording industry will survive, he argues, if it is able
to offer its users new things of value.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of dangers here,'' he said. ``But as a
society, we're very adept at adapting to compensate for these
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarke, it seems, would not disagree. Citing past innovations
from the photocopier to magnetic tape, he writes on his Web site:
``Artists and publishers all adapted to those new technologies and
learned how to use them and profit from them; they will adapt to
Freenet as well.''

HOLLYWOOD'S `QUANTUM PROJECT' HEADS FOR THE INTERNET
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DAVID BLOOM  
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's being billed as the first-ever feature film
created specifically for the Internet, and it's debuting Thursday
night, worldwide, from Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Whether some obscure film-school project beat ``The Quantum
Project'' to the Net, it's safe to say this is the first feature
ever created specifically for the Net that can boast a blue-ribbon
cast and crew.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Dorff stars as a physicist preoccupied by his studies of
the quantum universe of subatomic particles. By a series of
coincidences, he reunites with his former girlfriend, played by Fay
Masterson, then reconnects with his father, played by John Cleese.
</P>
<P>
   The $3 million project is the first of a planned four
``chapters'' of Net-only stories based around ``The Quantum
Project,'' according to Barnet Bain and Stephen Simon, the film's
producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most interesting part was designing the film for the
emotional and visual language of the Internet,'' said Simon.
</P>
<P>
   The two are best known for producing ``What Dreams May Come,''
on which ``The Quantum Project's'' director, Eugenio Zanetti, also
worked.
</P>
<P>
   Zanetti, who won an Oscar for production design on
``Restoration,'' said because the film was created for computers,
he could play with such formerly untouchable limitations as the
picture's aspect ratio, jumping it ``from IMAX to Cinemascope in a
single shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Given Zanetti's artistic chops, the film looks fabulous, and
though compressed, the story is engaging and cryptic enough to bear
repeated viewing.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it'll pack them in at the PC is another question.
</P>
<P>
   But pioneering Web site SightSound.com, which helped finance the
film and has exclusive rights to it for the next year, doesn't have
to have a big first weekend for the film to make economic sense on
the Web, officials said. Because the Net has effectively endless
shelf space, the film can continue to be available, and repeatedly
sold, for as long as the company wants.
</P>
<P>
   But for right now, only PC owners with recent versions of the
Windows Media Player will be able to play the movie (Mac users must
wait for Microsoft to update their version of the player). It'll
cost you $3.95 to buy the 37-minute movie, but once you download it
(beginning at 9:01 p.m. PST), you can watch it as often as you
want.
</P>
<P>
   Be warned, though: at nearly 90 megabytes, the download will
take four hours on a 56K modem. Cable modem or DSL connections will
take only about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Simon and Bain said they are experimenting with the business
model behind the film, including offering alternative versions
later this summer. Perhaps sometime in the future, they will even
let fans put together their own version of the movie, using an
array of scenes and soundtrack material, much as some underground
dance music enthusiasts routinely issue remixed tracks of other
artists' work.
</P>
<P>
   Simon and Bain, whose TV movie about Linda McCartney will debut
in three weeks, said they will create another four-part drama and
two comedies in coming years for the Net as they continue to
experiment with its possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This must be as near as I can imagine to the heyday of
Hollywood, where there was a process of discovery every moment of
the way,'' said Simon.

MICROSOFT MESS RUNS DEEP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week's vacation gave me leisure to contemplate the US
Justice Department's latest adventures in bloody-minded
belligerence _ the ``rescue'' of Elian Gonzales and the proposed
assassination of Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference? The doorkickers at Bill Gates's mansion
definitely have their fingers on the triggers.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps some of my readers at MIT can explain to me how I'll be
better off with two Microsoft monopolies instead of one. That's the
plan cobbled together by the US Justice Department and the
attorneys general of 19 states. Well, 17, anyway. The attorney
general of my native state of Illinois, along with his counterpart
in Ohio, refused to go along with a breakup. But Midwestern common
sense didn't stand a chance. Indeed, common sense has taken a
beating throughout this sorry affair.
</P>
<P>
   There's the astonishing refusal of Microsoft to settle this case
a couple of years ago, when it could have done so at virtually no
cost. And there's the remorseless arrogance with which the firm has
conducted itself throughout.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, there's the government's determination to
attack a prominent billionaire at the behest of some slightly less
prominent billionaires.
</P>
<P>
   Even the government's own star economic witness in the case
admitted he saw no sign that Microsoft's business practices were
hurting the public. But they sure bedeviled a lot of lesser
software moguls. It's their rage and envy that's driving this case
_ that and a tendency to full-auto ferocity that's become a
trademark of the Clinton Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   No question the Branch Davidians in Texas were lawbreakers
deserving of arrest. No question Elian belongs with his father. And
no question that Microsoft has crossed the line into monopoly abuse
from time to time. But in Waco, Miami, and now in Washington,
Attorney General Janet Reno has rejected moderate solutions and
sent in the SWAT team.
</P>
<P>
   So we're to have two Microsofts rather than one. There'll be a
Windows operating system company and another company that might be
called Everything Else Inc. Notice this remedy has little to do
with the alleged outrage that spawned the original case:
Microsoft's decision to include an Internet browser as part of
Windows. The government attorneys seem hardly interested in
righting that mythical wrong. Instead, they want to hobble
Microsoft, thereby ensuring that it sins no more.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the great divorce say it'll spawn an explosion of
software creativity. Hordes of new products will flood the market,
unhindered by the wrath of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Really? There already are plenty of Windows-alternative
operating systems. Like Macintosh, Linux, Unix, OS/2 and Be. There
are alternative office suites _ Lotus SmartSuite, Corel
WordPerfect, Sun StarOffice. But consumers overwhelmingly prefer
Windows and Microsoft Office, and will go on preferring them even
after a breakup.
</P>
<P>
   Another theory behind the breakup is that Microsoft will no
longer be able to use its hold over Windows to pressure customers
to buy other Microsoft products. But Everything Else Inc. would
still have an office suite software monopoly. Microsoft Office has
about 85 percent of the market. So the CEO of Everything Else Inc.
could offer discounts to Office users that buy other Microsoft
software, the sort of thing that got Microsoft in trouble in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent this would require limitations on the conduct of
Everything Else Inc., the very sort of remedy the government says
it wants to avoid. And yet, the government breakup proposal
includes a litany of such limitations to last until the company is
dismantled. If these restrictions can be made to work during the
years of courtroom appeals this case may spawn, why not longer? A
10-year requirement that Microsoft charge the same price to all its
customers and publish the secret codes that make Windows work ought
to level the playing field. Throw in a hefty fine to punish
Microsoft's hubris, and that's that.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not enough for the Justice Department. It would
rather spend tens of millions of taxpayer dollars on the
anti-Microsoft crusade, thereby slashing the company's stock value
and the personal wealth of millions of investors by tens of
billions of dollars. And for the grand finale, it wants to
eviscerate the company that probably did more than any other to put
personal computers in over half of all American homes.
</P>
<P>
   All for our own good, of course. Janet Reno has said so. She's
wrong, but as Lazaro Gonzales and Bill Gates have discovered, that
hardly matters.

 &HT;    Rebel flag fight moving to Georgia after S.C. vote
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ The Confederate battle flag is on its way down
in South Carolina. That means a full-fledged fight in Georgia is
not far behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's coming to Georgia sooner than later,'' said Republican
pollster Whit Ayres of Roswell, Ga..
</P>
<P>
   So far, Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes has played a passive role in the
brewing debate over the state flag, which incorporates the battle
emblem that's flown over the South Carolina Capitol dome since
1962.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes has encouraged dialogue but insists it's strictly a
matter for the Legislature _ the same stance South Carolina Gov.
Jim Hodges took until a tourism boycott by the NAACP triggered
persistent negative publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday night, on the state's Confederate Memorial Day,
the South Carolina House voted to remove the controversial banner
from its copper-clad Capitol dome. Derided by late-night comics,
South Carolina is the only state that flies the Rebel flag on top
of its Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The vote by the South Carolina House will only heat up debate in
Georgia, where Democrats _ especially Barnes _ are trying to keep a
lid on the issue through the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how he can avoid it,'' Ayres said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Georgia's black legislative caucus _ including Rep.
Tyrone Brooks (D-Atlanta) and Donzella James (D-College Park) _
have stayed in touch with their counterparts in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   For one, they've talked to South Carolina House Minority Leader
Gilda Cobb-Hunter (D-Orangeburg). She predicted South Carolina's
action is ``going to force action in those Southern states where
the Confederate flag is part of the official banner.''
</P>
<P>
   Cobb-Hunter said James visited South Carolina last week, ``and
we talked about this whole issue. She was sharing with me how
things are starting to percolate there in Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina Senate still must sign off on the House plan.
House leaders said they were optimistic the Senate would give the
bill routine concurrence.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker David Wilkins (R-Greenville) took the well to
personally to encourage support for a compromise the Senate passed
last month. The House slightly modified the bill during two full
days of debate. The bill passed 63-56.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a defining moment for our state,'' Wilkins said. ``I
think it's a giant step forward. This is a very decisive and
dignified action on the part of the South Carolina House. There
will be those that criticize this action, this compromise, some
that say we went too far, some saying we didn't go far enough. The
bottom line is we got the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would remove the battle flag from the Capitol dome and
move it to a prominent soldiers' memorial on the grounds on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Only three of 26 black House members voted for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The plan's great failing, many black legislators said, is that
the battle flag would move to an even more prominent place on the
Capitol grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That, at best, sends a mixed message and, I think, even a bad
message,'' said House Speaker Pro Tem Terry Haskins (R-Greenville).
``If the black members didn't vote for a plan that takes the flag
off the dome, that's hard to explain.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a final vote, typically a formality, remains in the House
for passage.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which originated in the Senate, goes back there for
inspection. The plan includes flying a square battle flag at the
38-foot granite Confederate Soldiers Monument. The memorial sits on
the north mall of the Capitol, a highly visible intersection of
Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does not heal. This does not come close to healing. It
only further divides,'' said Cobb-Hunter, who voted against the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   The House version would fly the battle flag on a higher flag
pole and provide illumination at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of sacrificing and giving all the time,'' Rep. Leon
Howard, a black Democrat from Columbia, said during a party caucus
meeting before the formal House debate. ``I'm not willing to
sacrifice anymore. We need to stop sacrificing principles.'' ``All
I can say is that not much there excites us,'' Dwight James, South
Carolina NAACP executive director, said outside the House chamber.

THE PRICE OF HELL? TRY $8 MILLION FOR STARTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oh, for heaven's sake. Hell is for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly the real thing, as in fire and brimstone.
We're talking virtual hell, as in the inferno known as
www.hell.com. The current owners, an artists' group, are putting
the Internet address up for sale in an auction to be handled by
HitDomains.com. Minimum bid: $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that folks tried to buy, bargain, or beg their way
into a spot a little further north on the spiritual scale, but
these are curious times. Add .com to the end of a word, and hell
becomes heaven; does anyone else remember when a yahoo was just an
ignorant brute?
</P>
<P>
   Words lack meaning, and so does money. It's not who you are or
what services you offer that matters, it's how catchy your
``brand'' is. HitDomains claims it has already had three serious
offers for the domain name. ``This is one of the most powerful
pieces of virtual real estate in the world,'' says a breathless
Eric Harrington, vice president of HitDomains. ``This is a battle
between good and evil. We hope this name falls into the hands of
someone who wants to make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   We never thought it would come to this: Forget tyrants. Forget
human rights. Forget poverty and starvation. The future of the
planet rests on the sale of a dot-com address.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no denying that whoever buys the domain name does
have the chance to change the meaning of the word in the
marketplace. Imagine hell.com as the online headquarters of an
international humanitarian organization. How about as the personal
page of, say, the Dali Lama? Talk about a media makeover.
</P>
<P>
   None of those scenarios is likely; the domain name will probably
be purchased by an entrepreneur hoping to sell stuff or offer a
useless online service. You can't beat the name recognition factor;
hell.com already gets about a million hits a month, because curious
browsers just want to see what's there. No doubt, hell.com will be
a big, gawdy commercial venture all about making money, just like
the rest of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But before we get too depressed, let's not forget the message of
Dante's ``Inferno.'' To paraphrase, hell hath many levels.
</P>
<P>
   The current hell.com owners, you see, represent the antithesis
of the commercial Internet. For five years, a mysterious crew has
been using the site to build what they describe as a ``parallel
Web.'' Founded by Los Angeles conceptual artist Kenneth Aronson,
hell.com is a consortium of 70 creative teams from 19 countries.
Some are starving artists, and others are successful Web designers.
The whole operation is enigmatic by design: When you go to the
site, it seems as if there is nothing there, just a black hole in
cyberspace. But if you are tenacious and fiddle around, you gain
``guest'' access to the site, a perplexing and intriguing labyrinth
of Web pages, ranging from beautiful art to technical brain
teasers.
</P>
<P>
   It's all very secretive and mysterious and categorically
noncommercial. So why is Aronson selling the name? ``It was
intended to be invisible, and it ended up being the Times Square of
the Internet,'' he says, and it's time to dump the popular address
and move on. He plans to use the money to support the art projects
and events staged by the group. Aronson, who rejects the word art
and describes himself as a ``conceptual strategist,'' is wary of
mixing the crass commercialism of the auction with the anarchistic
activities of his group, which will live on in a new incarnation at
www.no-such.com. You won't find much of anything there, though; you
have to click around the site for a while to gain access. That's
the point: Aronson really doesn't care if the site has an audience.
``Our guests refuse to accept boundaries,'' he says. ``If you're
tenacious enough, you can get on the guest list.''
</P>
<P>
   That won't be the case for the future proprietors of hell.com,
that's for sure. Whoever coughs up the $8 million will want to
generate as much traffic as possible. And who knows? Maybe the new
owner will merge with the search engine, GoTo.com. &QL; 
----- &QC;  Tuvalu is a tiny nation in the South Pacific that consists
of nine atolls covering 26 square kilometers. It doesn't have paved
roads. Most of its 10,000 residents do not have electricity, and
the land is barely arable. But Tuvalu does have something that
Western entrepreneurs covet: the Internet country code .tv.
</P>
<P>
   Every country gets what is called a top-level domain name; for
instance, France has .fr and Britain has .uk. Each country owns the
rights to divvy out Internet addresses within that domain, such as
croissant.fr. But given the fact that most folks don't even have a
refrigerator on Tuvalu, the nation's savvy politicians decided to
capitalize on the domain name. After a deal with a Canadian company
fell through, they sold the name to Idealab, a Pasadena Internet
company. Tuvalu got $12.5 million up front and will collect an
additional $50 million over the next 12 years. In addition, the
country gets a 20 percent stake in the new .tv business, which is
currently selling domain names like free.tv. The new company hopes
to convince television moguls that they really need to change their
Internet addresses to, say, ABC.tv.
</P>
<P>
   The citizens of Tuvalu are banking on the popularity of the
domain name as well. ``Our roads are not passable, and our wharf is
falling down,'' says Samuelu Teo, Tuvalu's minister of public
works, energy, and communication. ``We also need a decent hospital.
We have equity in the company, and we're keeping our fingers
crossed.''
</P>
<P>
   And who knows: Maybe someone out there is willing to fork out
millions for hell.tv.
</P>
<P>

----- &QC;  Ted Page is a tall guy with a deadpan expression. Fred Surr
is a shorter guy. Together, they're Ted and Fred Entertainment, and
they produce promotional movies for corporate clients. The local
producers also aspire to shoot a feature film. As part of their
efforts to raise money, they created a short called ``There Once
Was a Man From Pawtucket,'' in which a woman discovers her very
agreeable husband has been dead five years. Why didn't she notice?
He suffered from ambulatory mortosis, an imaginary condition that
enables dead people to continue to move their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Fred and Ted wanted publicity, so they posted the movie on their
site, fredandted.com, and also put up a Web site about the disease
at www.mortosis.com. Before they knew it, folks were visiting the
site, explaining that their own loved ones had suffered from the
disease for years.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Eric Perbos-Brinck gave up a promising management career
last year at Promodes, the big French retailer, to start an
Internet company called Bravonestor.com. He began in November with
two people, but already has 10 employees, with plans to hire five
more in the next few weeks. To fill the jobs, Perbos-Brinck, 31,
casts his net wide. One of his programmers is Moroccan. The
designer of search engines is Senegalese. Both were studying in
France as exchange students when Perbos-Brinck found them in a
desperate search.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult and it's an issue,'' he said. ``One of my
American investors said, `This is war, so get anyone you can,
anywhere.'''
</P>
<P>
   Perbos-Brinck's polyglot staff would not draw a second glance in
the United States, where the technology industry's ravenous demand
for skilled workers has created a multinational, multicultural work
force that includes many foreign nationals. But in Europe, his
effort to find qualified help has collided with one of Europe's
most divisive issues: immigration.
</P>
<P>
   The historic European antipathy toward immigrants has only
sharpened in recent years. But with the European economy now on the
rebound, unemployment dropping from the extremely high levels of
the mid-1990s and leaders clamoring to catch up with the United
States in high technology, business faces a serious problem.
</P>
<P>
   Although job creation is gradually lowering overall unemployment
rates, Europe finds itself in the curious situation of facing much
higher unemployment than in the United States yet simultaneously
suffering a critical shortage of skilled high-technology workers
that is expected to worsen.
</P>
<P>
   The shortfall is particularly acute in Internet and Web-related
businesses because European countries have not trained enough
workers of their own with high-technology skills, a problem they
are just beginning to address.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, even as overall opposition to immigration remains
deeply entrenched, European governments are under pressure to find
ways around these obstacles for at least some high-technology
workers.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer,
proposed in March to relax rules on hiring skilled foreign
nationals.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, the chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, set off a stormy
debate with a proposal to lift visa restrictions so that software
experts from India and elsewhere could work in Germany. Even though
the plan has not been approved, it has already attracted about
1,800 applications or requests for information.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-empting a final decision, cities like Frankfurt have begun
to make exceptions to the rule that keeps foreign computer experts
out.
</P>
<P>
   For Ernesto Schmitt, such openings in Europe's immigration net
cannot come to soon. Schmitt, 28, set up Peoplesound.com, a London
company that sells music over the Internet, and he uses all the
tricks common to start-ups in the United States to find and keep
talent, including the use of aggressive international headhunters
and the promise of equity stakes in his company. Yet recently, when
he discovered talented potential employees in South Africa, he
decided he could not hire them. ``We did not want the pain of
waiting six months for them to get visas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new economy is not waiting for governments to act on the
shortage, which is leading to brawls for talented people. Big
corporations, once the safe domain of career-oriented young
Europeans, are seeing their best talent lured away by headhunters;
other gifted young executives are leaving of their own accord,
willingly forfeiting the security of the old economy for the
rough-and-tumble risk of the new.
</P>
<P>
   Schmitt, who grew up in Belgium, the son of a Uruguayan mother
and German father, is perhaps typical of the new brand of European
Web business leader. A self-styled frustrated disc jockey, he took
the idea for his company from American models like MP3.com but
rejiggered it for the European market. After attracting investors
including Bernard Arnault, the wealthy chairman of the LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton luxury goods group, he gave up the comfort
of a secure job at the Boston Consulting Group to plunge into the
new economy.
</P>
<P>
   Olivier Gravelle, 29, operating in sparsely furnished offices in
Paris, recently set up the French unit of Wideyes.com, an online
job search company much like Monster.com in the United States.
Wideyes, founded in Sweden about a year ago, now employs 70 people
there and in Britain, France and Spain. By the end of the year,
after moving into Germany and Italy, it expects to have about 230
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a war for talent,'' said Gravelle, who is French.
Aggravating a basic shortage of skilled workers, upstart companies
are acquiring established businesses _ he cites the successful
hostile bid by the British wireless company Vodafone AirTouch for
the German phone giant Mannesmann _ and needing new-style managers
who are suited to the speed and complexity of electronic business.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who come to us looking for jobs want mobility; they
want to change jobs and to change geographically,'' Gravelle said.
Young Europeans, he added, ``understand their duty to manage their
skills and their careers.''
</P>
<P>
   Gravelle himself left a secure job at the consultants Booz Allen
&AMP; Hamilton in November to join Wideyes. He had met the Swedish
founders of Wideyes earlier, while working in Scandinavia for the
French bank Credit Lyonnais, before joining Booz Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, that kind of mobility was the preserve of a
small elite. Today it is so common that European companies are
having to learn how to hold on to talented people, often employing
means, like stock options, that not long ago were considered
symptoms of very un-European greediness. Last month, for example,
when Societe Generale in France announced the sale of shares in its
online banking unit, Fimatex, it did so not least to enable it to
retain talent by offering stock options, after the executive who
started Fimatex was lured by stock options to a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Consulting companies are among the main beneficiaries of the
growth, as demand soars from corporations that are in need of
skilled help.
</P>
<P>
   Marc A. Enjolras, a partner at Andersen Consulting in Paris,
says Andersen will hire 250 people in France this year, increasing
its staff to 2,750. To avoid losing people to Internet start-ups,
Andersen France is introducing a number of retention measures
already in use in the United States. Starting this year, Andersen's
French employees will receive ``e-units,'' or shares in a $1
billion venture capital fund that the firm established in December.
In France, as elsewhere, Andersen is also shortening the path to
full partner by eliminating the rank of associate partner.
</P>
<P>
   Hugues Bertrand, director of the Center for the Study of
Employment and Qualification in Marseille, a port city plagued by
high unemployment and urban decay, said that in large measure,
``companies that are successful are those that are creative and
active in finding people.'' Much European job growth is coming not
in technical professions, he added, but in traditional fields like
education, career training and health and fitness services.
``Preparation need not be so much technical as social _ dealing
with people, running an organization,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many business leaders argue that the shortage of technology
workers is real and that failure to address it will stunt Europe's
revived growth.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Vergnes, the 54-year-old chairman of Microsoft Europe,
points to a study commissioned by Microsoft and published in March
by International Data Corp. that suggests that European demand for
skilled professionals in telecommunications and computers will
outstrip supply by as much as 13 percent over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft recently joined a group of Europe-based technology
companies, including British Telecommunications, Nokia of Finland
and Siemens of Germany, as well as IBM Europe, to urge greater
cooperation between industry and governments in training skilled
technology workers.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest hit by the shortages, according to the International
Data study, will be Germany, which has the largest European economy
and is the heart of European Internet business. Demand for talent
in Germany is expected to exceed supply by up to 15 percent, or
more than 400,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Touring a computer fair in March, Schroeder, the German
chancellor, responded to industry's demands for help by taking a
chapter from U.S. policy and promising to offer temporary work
permits _ a kind of German green card _ to as many as 20,000
skilled foreigners, notably from India and Eastern Europe. In
return, German industry leaders promised to step up the training of
domestic computer experts.
</P>
<P>
   The plan quickly drew fire from labor unions and opposition
parties, who cited Germany's 4 million unemployed and 7.3 million
foreigners, the highest number of immigrants in any European
country. It also faced criticism from Schroeder's own labor
ministry. Gerd Andres, the ministry's No. 2 official, said the plan
would only ``bring cheap labor into the country.''
</P>
<P>
   German cities have jumped the gun on this issue. In Frankfurt,
the German financial capital and a major computer center, the local
investment promotion agency, with the approval of local immigration
officials, has persuaded six software companies from India to
establish affiliates in the city. The agency's director, Hartmut
Schwesinger, said recently that six more Indian companies were
about to follow and that he was in discussions with 30 more.
</P>
<P>
   Still, given the Continent's distaste for foreigners, not
everyone is convinced that foreign workers will come even if the
German proposal is repeated across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Milroy, who oversaw the shortages study for International
Data, recalled talking with Sri Lankan and Indian software experts
who said they would not be inclined to accept a European
invitation.
</P>
<P>
   Milroy recalled them saying, ``Europe is just not a welcoming
place to live.''

FORMER CAMBRIDGE TECHNOLOGY CEO COUNTERSUES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The former chief executive of Cambridge Technology
Partners countersued the large consulting firm Thursday, escalating
a fight over his launch of a rival start-up.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Cambridge Technology sued founder and former chief,
James K. Sims, claiming that he actively recruited its employees
for his new firm, in violation of an nonsolicitation agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also named Gen3 Partners Inc., Sims's Boston technology
consulting firm, and Arthur M. Toscanini, a former Cambridge
Technology chief financial officer who now works for Sims.
</P>
<P>
   In papers filed Thursday in Middlesex Superior Court, Gen3
Partners and the two executives said Cambridge Technology is
seeking a ``scapegoat'' for its ``own business shortcomings.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit provides a closer look at a once-powerful consulting
company that has begun to grapple with losses and a restless staff.
But the dispute also reflects the damage that start-ups in the
Boston area are beginning to inflict on older technology firms,
industry observers say.
</P>
<P>
   Similar battles have raged in Silicon Valley, where Oracle Corp.
and SAP have had little success in keeping workers from migrating
to younger Siebel Systems Inc., said Rob DeSisto, an analyst with
Gartner Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people want to leave and they're entrepreneurial, they're
going to take the risk and chance it,'' DeSisto said. ``I don't
think lawsuits would in any way scale back activity that would
happen anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The exodus from Cambridge Technology has been particularly swift
and painful. A Lehman Brothers analyst recently estimated a 48
percent turnover rate _ the highest in the information technology
services sector.
</P>
<P>
   In their countersuit, Sims and Toscanini seek an unspecified
amount of money for losses they allegedly incurred due to Cambridge
Technology's actions.
</P>
<P>
   Toscanini claims the firm refused to pay his 1999 bonus and
misreported his wages to tax authorities. Sims alleges two
directors made promises they did not keep to try to prevent him
from immediately selling his 2.5 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fairly simple dispute,'' said Tim Mead, a Cambridge
Technology senior vice president. ``At the end of the day, we're
just alleging there has been a broken promise to Cambridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Cambridge Technology also sued Semtor Inc., a Fort
Lauderdale technology company founded by Harold Gubnitsky, a former
Cambridge Technology vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, Gubnitsky said he has worked hard to
build a corporate culture that would lure talented employees,
which, it so happens, include a few from Cambridge Technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is people go to the best places to work,'' he
said. ``In this economy, that's what it's all about.''

THE INNOVATOR'S DILEMMA, AND MICROSOFT'S  
 AN E-HOLSTER TO CARRY GADGETS  
 MODEM INVENTOR WILL HEAD NEW E-BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Gates complains that everyone at Microsoft pitching a new
project seems to invoke the notion of the innovator's dilemma. The
term, Gates told Forbes magazine last year, is ``a required slide
in every funding presentation.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gates might do well to pay attention, says Clayton M.
Christensen, the Harvard Business School professor who coined the
phrase. His book, ``The Innovator's Dilemma: When New Technologies
Cause Great Firms to Fail,'' has been causing a stir at technology
companies since it was published in 1997. It describes how leading
companies are ambushed by new products.
</P>
<P>
   Technology industries, he says, go through life cycles. A large,
integrated company makes sense, in his view, when a technology is
young and it is a formidable task simply to make a product or
service that works. In the days when the national telephone network
was being built, Christensen said, ``a single company would have
dominated, even if AT&AMP;T were not created.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet as a technology matures, he noted, ``it causes the industry
to disintegrate.'' Then, speed of marketing and ease of
customization tend to matter more. That is when a technology leader
is most susceptible to a disruptive technology coming up from the
bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Today's market for personal-computer software, Christensen
insists, has the characteristics of maturity. ``For Microsoft, the
mainstream product lines _ the Windows operating system and Office
suite _ are just huge software programs,'' he said. ``Most users
don't use more than 10 percent of their features.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Java,'' Christensen said, referring to the Sun
Microsystems language for Internet programming, ``is coming up.''
Like many insurgent technologies, he noted, Java was first
developed for another market _ consumer electronics _ but it found
its early use on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   His prognosis for Microsoft? ``No matter what happens in the
antitrust case, Microsoft will go where IBM went in mainframes,''
said Christensen, whose book is being published in paperback by
HarperBusiness. ``Microsoft will still be dominant in PC operating
systems but, like mainframes, that will not be the mainstream of
computing anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft,'' he added, ``will still be around, but it will not
be the all-powerful entity it once was. This is the mechanism by
which markets destroy monopoly.''
</P>

<P>
   An E-Holster to Carry Gadgets
</P>
<P>
   As Tom Traeger's collection of portable electronic devices grew,
he saw the day approaching when he would own more gadgets than he
could comfortably carry. He imagined something that would let him
wear his cell phone, his organizer and even his pager at the same
time and give him easy, quick access to any of them. He imagined,
in fact, something like a shoulder holster.
</P>
<P>
   The result was the e-Holster, an accessory that closely
resembles a gun holster and can be worn completely concealed under
a jacket or sweater. The e-Holster was designed by Jerry Ahern of
Commerce, Ga., a firearms-concealment expert whom Traeger expected
to bring an intuitive feel to the problem. Designers of gun
holsters, he reasoned, know the ergonomics of easy access.
</P>
<P>
   Traeger's company, Personal Electronics Concealment of St.
Augustine, Fla., sells the e-Holster, along with his newest
product, the e-BeltPouch, from its Internet site
(www.eholster.com). The e-BeltPouch attaches to an ordinary belt
and holds a cell phone or an organizer in a sideways position,
permitting the wearer to sit down without fear of losing the
device.
</P>
<P>
   The basic e-Holster, in nylon, costs $99.95; a leather version
is $119.95. The e-BeltPouches range in price from $47.95 to $84.95.
</P>
<P>
   With a hand-held organizer on one side, a cell phone on the
other and a pager clipped to the harness, the e-Holster wearer can
look like a road warrior. ``There is a little macho thing to it,''
Traeger said.
</P>
<P>
   But that little macho thing might be a problem. ``I don't think
it's a very good idea,'' a San Francisco Police Department official
at the department's shooting range said. An officer frisking
someone, for instance, could think they're carrying a weapon. ``It
would certainly be a concern for any officer. They'd have to be on
the alert.''

   Modem Inventor Will Head New E-Business
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Hayes knows how to make money _ and how to lose it as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Credited with inventing the computer modem in 1978 as a
29-year-old engineer working out of his kitchen, Hayes built the
company that he had started to manufacture the devices, Hayes
Microcomputer Products, into an industry powerhouse in the 1980s.
But the company failed to adapt as lower-cost competitors eroded
its market share, and after years of struggle, it finally shut its
doors last year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after quietly serving as a consultant for Internet
companies and heading an Internet industry association, Hayes
recently re-emerged, this time as chief executive of a new
e-commerce unit of the online retailing company International
Brands.
</P>
<P>
   The company, called World Best Buy, has a Web site selling
discounted merchandise like clothing and electronics as well as
used items through an electronic garage-sale format that matches
buyers with sellers. It recently added an auction service and plans
additional services soon, though Hayes would not go into details.
</P>
<P>
   The site has $40 million in prepaid ads, Hayes said, and
interest among other advertisers, particularly in the automotive
business, is high. The site has a section dedicated to cars and car
parts.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Hayes Microcomputer, which introduced the
Hayes-compatible PC modem in 1981, remains a cautionary tale of the
computer industry. The company reached a peak of $250 million in
annual sales before seeking bankruptcy protection for the first
time in 1994, after failing to react quickly enough to competition
for its principal product and the rise of powerful new competitors
like 3Com and U.S. Robotics.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes successfully resisted takeover bids for several years, but
finally merged with Access Beyond in 1997, and ceded control.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of 1998, the company lost $17.6 million and
filed for bankruptcy again in October. In January 1999, Hayes
Corp., as it was then known, shut down for good, ending a chapter
in PC history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a disappointment,'' Hayes said, adding that he lost
$150 million in the bankruptcy. ``So I started doing what I know
best,'' he said, ``helping companies grow fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides consulting, Hayes has spent the last few years as
chairman of the U.S. Internet Industry Association, a trade group
that has focused, among other things, on promoting the Internet as
a tax-free zone.

 &HT;    Elian's fate now up to court
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Elian Gonzalez's fears of persecution if he's returned
to Cuba are real, and the 6-year-old boy should be given a hearing
on his political asylum claims, a lawyer for Elian's Miami
relatives told a federal appeals court today.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hearing is the heart and soul of justice,'' Miami attorney
Kendall Coffey told the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   If the boy returns to Cuba, Coffey said, Elian's beliefs about
the United States will be ``purged'' by the Marxist government and
he will become a ``traumatized'' child.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington attorney Gregory Craig, speaking on behalf of
Elian's father, told the court that ``common sense, common law''
dictate that Juan Miguel Gonzalez should be allowed to speak for
his son and return him to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez has the best interests of his son at heart
and is a loving parent, Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows this child better than anyone in this courtroom, or
anyone else on the face of this planet ... There is a real family
here,'' Craig said. ``It's a close-knit family....(But) it is in
jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig urged the court not to allow Elian and his father to
become ``hostage'' to a lengthy immigration appeals process. ``Lift
the cloud of doubt,'' Craig said. ``Set them free.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel _ Judges J.L. Edmondson of Atlanta, Joel
Dubina of Montgomery and Charles Wilson of Tampa _ heard arguments
lasting one hour and 15 minutes on the contentious immigration
dispute. Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, and the boy's,
cousin, Marisleysis Gonzalez, sat side by side in the second row of
the packed courtroom. Elian and Juan Miguel Gonzalez did not attend
the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Before the hearing, Edmondson walked into the courtroom and
asked everyone to remain quiet, explained the court's procedures
and said a decision on the case will not be issued today or by the
end of this week.
</P>
<P>
   Edmondson said his ``guess'' was that the court's ruling would
be released ``in a few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether the Immigration and Naturalization Service
should grant Elian a hearing on his application for asylum. U.S.
Attorney General Janet Reno has decided that Elian was not
competent to file such a claim and that his father, not the boy's
Miami relatives, was the most qualified person to make such a
decision.
</P>
<P>
   During the arguments, Wilson, an appointee of President
Clinton's, expressed skepticism that 6-year-old Elian knew what he
was doing when he filed his asylum application.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said he had reviewed Elian's asylum application and noted
that the boy appeared unable to sign his own last name. A ``third
party'' also wrote down most of the answers, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson also read aloud one question asked asylum applicants:
whether they have been associated with various organizations, such
as a political party, a student group, a paramilitary group or a
human rights group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you telling me a 6-year-old is competent enough to answer
questions like that?'' Wilson asked.
</P>
<P>
   And Wilson said that if the application's answers were written
by someone other than Elian, ``doesn't this reflect a fear of
persecution by someone other than (Elian) himself?''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, as well as the other judges, threw out hypothetical
questions, trying to get Coffey to explain what kind of precedent
the court may be setting if it overrules Reno's decision.
</P>
<P>
   What if a ``teenage babysitter'' takes a 2-year-old alien child
down to the INS office, get the child to scrawl his name on an
asylum application? Wilson asked.
</P>
<P>
   The child's parents come running down to the INS office
``screaming'' about it, the judge noted. ``Are you telling me the
INS doesn't have any discretion'' to throw out such a petition?
</P>
<P>
   Coffey noted that Elian's case is not like that example, but
asserted that if the child's asylum application is ``facially
sufficient,'' a hearing should be held.
</P>
<P>
   Coffey conceded that asylum applications are complex, and he
asserted that most of the applications are made by people who do
not completely understand them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we have lawyers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Edmondson, in his questions, noted that Lazaro Gonzalez, who
applied on behalf of Elian, was a blood relative who once had
temporary custody of the boy. Edmondson suggested that it may not
be an entirely settled matter of law that someone other than
Elian's father can speak on the boy's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Kneedler, U.S. deputy solicitor general, told the court
that the law gives great deference to findings made by the INS
commissioner and the U.S. attorney general in asylum matters.
</P>
<P>
   In Elian's case, ``careful consideration'' was taken to decide
that Juan Miguel Gonzalez should speak on behalf of his son,
Kneedler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sacred bond between a parent and child,'' Kneedler
said. ``It's the father's choice to make.''

WITH ITS E-MAIL INFECTED, HOW FORD SCRAMBLED AND CAUGHT UP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ Kevin J. Timms, the Ford Motor Co.'s
37-year-old computer security manager, arrived at work here in his
metallic blue Mercury Cougar at 6:45 on Thursday morning, a
not-uncommon hour for managers at Midwest manufacturers. He was
just walking into his office when the phone rang.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Chapman, the manager of Ford's computer center in Warley,
England, had determined that a new, malignant computer program was
spreading swiftly across Ford's global e-mail network. He suggested
that the entire network be shut down for the first time. Timms
agreed, and told his staff to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   The decision quickly reached LeRoy Boyd, a network administrator
here. He began shutting down the computer servers that he oversaw
in one of Ford's main computer labs, a high-ceiling room nearly
half the length of a football field and crammed with tall racks of
black metal laden with computer equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd usually needed just seven minutes to complete that task,
but it proved more time-consuming on Thursday morning because of
frequent interruptions. ``It took me about 20 minutes,'' he said
with a tinge of embarrassment. ``People were coming in and walking
up and saying, `I can't get on the network.'''
</P>
<P>
   Like companies and individuals around the world, Ford was caught
by surprise on Thursday by a rogue software program propagated by
e-mail messages with ``I love you'' in the subject field. People
who clicked on an attachment to the message accidentally forwarded
the message to everyone in their e-mail address book if they were
using Microsoft Outlook, a popular e-mail program. Those who opened
the attachment also risked losing some computer files.
</P>
<P>
   The rogue program was sent to as many as 45 million computers
worldwide, jamming electronic networks. Law enforcement officials
continued looking this weekend for the program's author, with the
search centering on the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Ford was hit particularly hard, with up to 1,000 computers
directly infected and 30,000 salaried employees in Europe alone
receiving 140,000 contaminated e-mail messages in the three hours
before the network was shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's difficulties with the program were exacerbated by the
sheer scale of its operations: 130,000 desktop computers in 46
countries spread across almost every time zone, and operated by
people speaking 14 languages. Not until Friday afternoon was Ford
able to turn its e-mail service back on for its North American
operations, while service did not resume in Latin America, Europe,
Asia and Africa until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even at Ford, the rogue program appears to have caused only
limited permanent damage. None of its 114 factories stopped,
according to the automaker. Computerized engineering blueprints and
other technical data were unaffected. Ford was still able to post
information for dealers and auto parts suppliers on Web sites that
it uses for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Many Ford employees temporarily lost access to their personal
electronic calendars of meeting times. But the damage appears to
have been limited mainly to the erasing of some employees' files
with images and recordings, Timms said.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his office here near the top of Ford's world
headquarters, with a view across miles of Ford office buildings and
factories, James Yost, the automaker's chief information officer,
concluded that the malignant program had in some ways resembled a
vandalism attack against the outside of an assembly plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like someone breaking windows,'' he said.
``You've got to fix the windows so it won't get cold inside, but it
doesn't stop production.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the rogue program was particularly irritating for
Ford because the company's leaders have been trying to transform
their goliath of heavy manufacturing into more of a high-technology
company. Beginning later this month, Ford will offer desktop
computers with unlimited Internet access and color printers to each
of its 350,000 employees for just $5 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Nasser, Ford's chief executive, sends an e-mail message
of company business developments to every salaried employee
worldwide each Friday, although the most recent message was not
sent until Sunday to avoid overloading the recovering mail system.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday afternoon it was not at all clear when Nasser
would be able to send his message. Timms and Boyd had called in
dozens of computer engineers, who filled Boyd's computer lab. But
when the Ford officials got the results of a quick analysis of the
virus they had commissioned from McAfee.com, an outside computer
security company, they found to their surprise that they recognized
large blocks of computer code in the rogue program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at the script and we thought, `We've used this kind
of stuff,''' said Tom Truden, Ford's team leader for computer
emergency responses.
</P>
<P>
   Sections of the maliciously designed program turned out to be
very similar to software that the company uses to distribute
software updates _ including cures for security problems _ to Ford
computers around the world. The similarities between the malicious
program and Ford's software meant that computers already infected
with the program might not be able to execute cures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 3 or 4 o'clock when we realized we were staring at a
bit of a problem,'' Timms said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's own computer engineers had designed the company's update
distribution software, but they used publicly available building
blocks, Timms continued. The rogue program uses some of the same
building blocks, though there is no sign that the rogue program was
developed from the software that Ford tailored to its own needs, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   By 6 on Thursday evening, Timms and his staff at the computer
lab had agreed on an outline of new software to distribute as an
antidote for the malignant program, using different computer codes.
They ordered pizza and spent the night working with experts from
Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft, both of which have large staffs
living in Detroit to provide technical support for the automakers,
which are among their biggest customers.
</P>
<P>
   The new software was written by 3 a.m. on Friday. The engineers
then spent nearly three hours testing the software on computers
designed to simulate Ford networks overseas. They made sure that
the software would work, for example, on Ford computers in China,
which use Chinese characters for the displays but the same
underlying programming as Ford computers elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Timms had gone home for several hours of sleep. His engineers
paged him as he drove back to the computer lab before dawn and had
him pick up a couple of boxes of bagels and doughnuts for them.
</P>
<P>
   Ford began turning the computer servers back on for North
American e-mail users early Friday afternoon, and other regions'
servers were returned to service on Saturday. The first time each
desktop computer connected to the Ford network after it was
restored, it would automatically and immediately download a remedy
to eliminate the rogue program, because of the new software written
on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   To be cautious, the network's servers were turned on a few at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's starting to get tired, and you've got to slow down
so you don't make a mistake,'' said Boyd on Friday afternoon, after
working for 34 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Timms said that e-mail sent to the company while the servers
were off had been saved for later delivery, although technicians at
Ford's computer lab said that some mail, particularly attachments,
might have been lost.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ford financial officers had no immediate estimate of the cost to
the company from the rogue program, since employees carried out
other tasks instead of exchanging e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be interesting to see the cost analysis that finance
does,'' Truden said.
</P>
<P>
   A few people even suggested facetiously that the delay or loss
of a few Powerpoint slide presentations and some e-mail might have
actually helped Ford, according to Dave Bent, the chief information
officer for the auto parts division. ``The joke is, `A day without
e-mail _ it's great,' '' he said.

 &HT;    Elian's fate now up to court
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Elian Gonzalez's fears of persecution if he's returned
to Cuba are real, and the 6-year-old boy should be given a hearing
on his political asylum claims, a lawyer for Elian's Miami
relatives told a federal appeals court today.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hearing is the heart and soul of justice,'' Miami attorney
Kendall Coffey told the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   If the boy returns to Cuba, Coffey said, Elian's beliefs about
the United States will be ``purged'' by the Marxist government and
he will become a ``traumatized'' child.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington attorney Gregory Craig, speaking on behalf of
Elian's father, told the court that ``common sense, common law''
dictate that Juan Miguel Gonzalez should be allowed to speak for
his son and return him to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez has the best interests of his son at heart
and is a loving parent, Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows this child better than anyone in this courtroom, or
anyone else on the face of this planet ... There is a real family
here,'' Craig said. ``It's a close-knit family....(But) it is in
jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig urged the court not to allow Elian and his father to
become ``hostage'' to a lengthy immigration appeals process. ``Lift
the cloud of doubt,'' Craig said. ``Set them free.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel _ Judges J.L. Edmondson of Atlanta, Joel
Dubina of Montgomery and Charles Wilson of Tampa _ heard arguments
lasting one hour and 15 minutes on the contentious immigration
dispute. Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, and the boy's,
cousin, Marisleysis Gonzalez, sat side by side in the second row of
the packed courtroom. Elian and Juan Miguel Gonzalez did not attend
the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Before the hearing, Edmondson walked into the courtroom and
asked everyone to remain quiet, explained the court's procedures
and said a decision on the case will not be issued today or by the
end of this week.
</P>
<P>
   Edmondson said his ``guess'' was that the court's ruling would
be released ``in a few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether the Immigration and Naturalization Service
should grant Elian a hearing on his application for asylum. U.S.
Attorney General Janet Reno has decided that Elian was not
competent to file such a claim and that his father, not the boy's
Miami relatives, was the most qualified person to make such a
decision.
</P>
<P>
   During the arguments, Wilson, an appointee of President
Clinton's, expressed skepticism that 6-year-old Elian knew what he
was doing when he filed his asylum application.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said he had reviewed Elian's asylum application and noted
that the boy appeared unable to sign his own last name. A ``third
party'' also wrote down most of the answers, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson also read aloud one question asked asylum applicants:
whether they have been associated with various organizations, such
as a political party, a student group, a paramilitary group or a
human rights group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you telling me a 6-year-old is competent enough to answer
questions like that?'' Wilson asked.
</P>
<P>
   And Wilson said that if the application's answers were written
by someone other than Elian, ``doesn't this reflect a fear of
persecution by someone other than (Elian) himself?''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, as well as the other judges, threw out hypothetical
questions, trying to get Coffey to explain what kind of precedent
the court may be setting if it overrules Reno's decision.
</P>
<P>
   What if a ``teenage babysitter'' takes a 2-year-old alien child
down to the INS office, get the child to scrawl his name on an
asylum application? Wilson asked.
</P>
<P>
   The child's parents come running down to the INS office
``screaming'' about it, the judge noted. ``Are you telling me the
INS doesn't have any discretion'' to throw out such a petition?
</P>
<P>
   Coffey noted that Elian's case is not like that example, but
asserted that if the child's asylum application is ``facially
sufficient,'' a hearing should be held.
</P>
<P>
   Coffey conceded that asylum applications are complex, and he
asserted that most of the applications are made by people who do
not completely understand them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we have lawyers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Edmondson, in his questions, noted that Lazaro Gonzalez, who
applied on behalf of Elian, was a blood relative who once had
temporary custody of the boy. Edmondson suggested that it may not
be an entirely settled matter of law that someone other than
Elian's father can speak on the boy's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Kneedler, U.S. deputy solicitor general, told the court
that the law gives great deference to findings made by the INS
commissioner and the U.S. attorney general in asylum matters.
</P>
<P>
   In Elian's case, ``careful consideration'' was taken to decide
that Juan Miguel Gonzalez should speak on behalf of his son,
Kneedler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sacred bond between a parent and child,'' Kneedler
said. ``It's the father's choice to make.''

ONLINE RETAILERS SET THEIR SIGHTS ON PRIVATE-LABEL MERCHANDISE

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Internet retailers spent the latter half of the 1990s trumpeting
the differences between their business models and those of
traditional retailers. Now that Wall Street is holding the
e-tailers accountable and demanding signs of future profitability,
Web merchants have shown a new respect for their bricks-and-mortar
brethren.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point: E-commerce companies have turned to an old
retailing standby, private-label manufacturing, to give them higher
profit margins and better control of inventory. Items like dog
food, cosmetics, diamonds, toys and golf clubs, to name a few, now
wear dot-com labels, and more are joining every week.
</P>
<P>
   Online retail executives say that by manufacturing their own
goods and selling them alongside well-known brands, they can hasten
the slow march toward profits.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts generally agree, but caution that several obstacles
could slow or even stall the private-label effort online. And in an
environment in which Web merchants have decreasing room for error,
they are moving as gingerly as they can _ while maintaining
Internet speed _ into this corner of the retailing realm.
</P>
<P>
   Among the latest companies to announce a private-label effort is
Ashford.com, an online seller of jewelry, apparel and other goods.
Late last month, the company rolled out the Ashford Collection, an
assortment of jewelry manufactured exclusively for Ashford, and it
will add similar lines of pens, scarves and leather goods in the
coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth E. Kurtzman, the company's chief executive, said several
factors were behind the move, but none more important than profit
margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``By purchasing directly from manufacturers, we can price 40 to
50 percent cheaper and still make 50 to 70 percent margins,'' he
said. ``If we can generate 20 percent of our sales from private
label, and have a 60 percent margin, while the other 80 percent of
sales generates a 35 percent margin, that's a definite contributor
to cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Another benefit of private-label manufacturing, Kurtzman said,
is that his company ``can react to customer trends more quickly
because the turnaround time is much shorter.'' For instance, he
said, if a certain type of earring generates buzz among consumers,
the company could have that earring in stock within six weeks,
``whereas with some of the brands, it'd take a year or more to see
changes in the product lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Such goods are also less likely to collect dust in the
warehouse, Kurtzman said. ``And with faster inventory turns, you
have less cash tied up in your inventory,'' he added. ``Again, that
helps you reach profitability more quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Van Kleeck, vice president of the National Retail
Federation, a trade group, said selling by private label ``has been
a very serious growth vehicle for many traditional
bricks-and-mortar retailers in the past seven or eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives retailers greater control of sales and marketing,''
he said, because brand manufacturers often dictate the terms of
pricing and advertising. ``And obviously, it's significantly more
profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   But Van Kleeck said dot-com companies faced a greater challenge
in introducing private labels because online shoppers generally
have a brand name in mind before they visit a specific Web site.
Consumers may be more wary of unbranded goods like private label
clothing that they have never seen, felt or tried on. ``The
consumers who've bought into e-commerce have done so because they
know the merchant or the product,'' Van Kleeck said.
</P>
<P>
   Getting consumers to try the product of a newly created company,
he said, could require considerably more marketing. ``But getting
people to turn away from traditional brands also takes time,'' Van
Kleeck said. ``And in Internet time, who knows what that means.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Chipshot.com, one of the earliest proponents of
online private-label retailing, the answer is two years. The
company, which sells golfing merchandise, began manufacturing irons
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The company's chief executive, Brian Sroub, said Chipshot
generated a substantial portion of its revenues by selling its own
brand. ``It's been the basis of our business,'' Sroub said. He
added that the private-label approach ``allows us to offer superior
quality at a lower price, and retain higher margins for
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, with Chipshot irons, Sroub said, the company buys
the grips, shafts and club heads from the same manufacturers that
supply the traditional brands, so the quality is the same. But
because Chipshot assembles the clubs when the orders are taken, it
can customize the clubs to the customer's specifications and
deliver them within a week _ a service that can take several weeks
at offline retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers of private-label merchandise must balance such
benefits against potentially sizable pitfalls. Among them is the
possibility that well-known manufacturers will refuse to sell them
their goods if they sense that the retailer is competing too
fiercely against them. Such so-called channel conflict can doom
e-tailers that use the big brands to draw customers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, not all retail categories are so dependent on brands, and
those that are not have generated some of the more aggressive
private-label efforts on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of the sales of Furniture.com, for instance, are
attributable to private-label brands. Andrew Brooks, the company's
chief executive, said the site began carrying private-label goods
in its early days partly because the brand-name manufacturers did
not want to alienate their traditional retailer partners by selling
through a Web merchant.
</P>
<P>
   But the company quickly learned that ``furniture buyers don't
shop for brand,'' but for style, Brooks said. As a result, the Web
site groups furniture into collections of similar styles, he said,
an approach that yielded $20 million in sales during the last
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The paucity of well-known furniture brands is perhaps one reason
another high-profile e-tailer, eToys, is rolling out its
private-label effort with a collection of children's furnishings.
Jane Saltzman, vice president for merchandising at eToys, said the
company would begin selling 500 different products with the eToys
brand this fall, and branch out to other categories besides
furniture. ``We'll grow beyond that 500, but not to tens of
thousands,'' she said. ``I see this as a complement to our
assortment.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Kurtzman, of Ashford.com, said: ``It's important to
understand that this is about optimizing the balance between
branded and private-label goods. It's not a panacea for an Internet
retailer. It won't completely change the business model. But it's
certainly something we all need to do to generate cash and achieve
profitability more quickly. And the companies that don't do it will
have a harder time getting to where they need to be.''

TWO STURDY COMPANIES ARE STRONG CANDIDATES TO BE THE NEXT CISCO  
 BY SETH SCHIESEL  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Right now, Cisco Systems seems as close to perfect as a
technology company can be.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest maker of Internet communications equipment, Cisco is
also the second-most valuable company in the nation, after General
Electric. It has succeeded in elevating its chief executive, John
Chambers, to near-deity status in some quarters, and has even
managed to stay in the government's good graces, in contrast to
Microsoft, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Which all means that this is probably an excellent time to think
about which companies have a legitimate shot at eating Cisco's
lunch. After all, one of the canons of the technology business the
last two decades has been that it is at a company's moment of
maximum optimism that the seeds of trouble are most likely
germinating. (Think IBM. Or for that matter, Microsoft.)
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the companies that appear best positioned to be the
next powerhouses in communications equipment do not want to eat
Cisco's lunch at all. Rather, moving in new economy time, they are
planning financial and technical smorgasbords of their own for the
next generation of digital networks.
</P>
<P>
   In an arboreal coincidence, the two leading candidates among the
many young companies vying to be the ``next Cisco'' are called
Juniper Networks and Sycamore Networks. Though they do very
different things, the two companies are remarkably similar in many
ways. They have innovative technologies, Juniper in high-capacity
Internet routers and Sycamore in optical networking. They are both
narrowly focused but forward-looking. They have the financial
resources to position themselves for growth. And perhaps most
important, each is led by an executive who has been there before.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's interesting about Juniper and Sycamore is that what you
have is that this is not just a category-killer but in many cases a
category-definer,'' said Steven D. Levy, a Lehman Bros.
communications equipment analyst. ``They're both hypergrowth
companies, and they have managements that have seen at least one or
two wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco, Juniper and Sycamore are spoiling to sell equipment to
both established and upstart communications carriers for the next
generation of high-speed networks. Those networks will be necessary
to meet the growing demand for Internet and other data
communications services.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it barely generated $100 million in revenue last
year, Juniper has already established its leadership in a sector
that Cisco wants to own: ultrahigh-capacity Internet switches. Put
simply, Juniper's systems can route more billions of digital bits
each second more reliably than anyone else's.
</P>
<P>
   With its almost ludicrously impressive financial strength, Cisco
is never to be discounted. But there are good reasons to believe
that Juniper will be able to go toe-to-toe with Cisco the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
   First, Juniper is focused on high-end Internet routers for big
communications carriers. Cisco had its start selling relatively
low-capacity routers for use in corporate networks, and analysts
say it still derives two-thirds of its revenue from corporate
customers, though it is selling more to communications carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Second, as strong as Cisco may be in developing new
technologies, the company is best known for acquiring and
integrating other companies. But there are not many companies that
Cisco could acquire to help in its battle against Juniper. Nexabit
Networks, one company in the same sector, has been acquired by
Lucent Technologies, while Avici Systems, another high-end routing
company, has not yet announced big commercial customers.
</P>
<P>
   In a bit of backhand diplomacy, Scott Kriens, Juniper's chief
executive, said: ``Our success doesn't mean that the other will go
away. Cisco is' certainly not going to go away, just like IBM did
not go away. But they are not any more likely to dominate
networking in the future than IBM dominated computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Kriens himself is well positioned to compete against Cisco.
Cisco's carrier-sales group essentially did not exist until Cisco
acquired Kriens' previous company, Stratacom, for about $4 billion
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, Kriens is quite similar to Daniel Smith,
Sycamore's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore is at the forefront of the next generation of optical
networking, which is set to allow communications carriers to route
digital information from one point to another using lightwaves.
Cisco has tried to add optical networking gear to its offerings
with its acquisitions the last year of the Cerent Corp., Monterey
Networks and a unit of Pirelli of Italy, but it remains a minor
player in that market. Sycamore's main competition in optical
networking is not Cisco but the giants of the communications
industry, including Lucent, Nortel Networks of Canada and Fujitsu
of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's previous company, Cascade Communications, was a
competitor of Stratacom for much of the 1990s and is now deep
inside Lucent (by way of its sale in 1997 to Ascend Communications,
which was subsequently acquired by Lucent).
</P>
<P>
   Like Kriens, Smith is betting that his company's focus on a
specific and potentially lucrative niche will allow it to
outmaneuver titans like Lucent and Cisco that are trying to span a
variety of communications sectors. And like any good entrepreneur,
Smith tempers his confidence with caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly do respect Cisco,'' he said. ``They're very
aggressive, in every way. But I sure don't fear them. I know that
when I'm on the field with them I better have my chinstrap buckled
and be ready to hit. And I think they know that about me.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Since the beginning of the Computer Age, microprocessors have
been transforming mankind's machines, endowing them with memory,
flexibility, precision and the ability to share information.
</P>
<P>
   Now, miniaturized machines, reduced to microchip dimensions, are
working alongside or in place of the processors.
</P>
<P>
   These tiny devices known as MEMS, for microelectromechanical
systems, include valves, levers, motors and microphones. In the
form of tiny sensors, millions of MEMS have already made their way
into products like automotive air bags, ink-jet printers and
disposable blood pressure analyzers.
</P>
<P>
   These days, though, the MEMS spotlight is on minuscule mirrors
and the central role they may soon play in communications. Various
companies are introducing MEMS-based switches to control the paths
of lightwaves through the rapidly expanding networks of optical
fiber cables that make up the Internet's backbone. By bouncing the
lightwaves off MEMS mirrors instead of running them through
electronic switches, networks could improve Internet efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be the true validation of the technology,'' said
Robert L. Bratter, president and chief executive of Cronos
Integrated Microsystems, a designer and maker of MEMS components
based in Morrisville, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   JDS Uniphase, a rapidly growing telecommunications equipment
supplier in Nepean, Ontario, near Ottawa, is certainly betting on
it. In April, the company agreed to buy Cronos for $750 million in
stock _ a rich price for a start-up with annual sales of only about
$10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Another MEMS player is Nortel Networks, one of North America's
largest and oldest makers of telecommunications gear. Nortel agreed
in March to pay $3.25 billion in stock for Xros Inc., a start-up in
Sunnyvale, Calif. Although Xros has no sales yet, it does have a
MEMS design for big network switches.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, Nortel snapped up CoreTek, a start-up in
Wilmington, Mass., that uses MEMS in the design of lasers that can
be tuned to send signals of different wavelengths through optical
networks. CoreTek investors will get up to $1.43 billion in Nortel
shares if CoreTek meets certain development milestones.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Nortel's main rival, Lucent Technologies _ North
America's largest manufacturer of telecommunications equipment _
has announced commercial availability of its first large MEMS
switch. Last month, Lucent signed Global Crossing as its first
customer.
</P>
<P>
   Success for MEMS in the optical communications market would
finally dispel the aura of failed promise that settled over MEMS a
decade ago after early missteps and a naivete about how fast the
technology would take hold.
</P>
<P>
   MEMS advocates recall a surge of interest in the 1980s, which
they say brought a flood of publicity to brilliant, but useless,
creations. For example, Nippondenso, a Japanese affiliate of
Toyota, assembled several MEMS devices into a model car the size of
a grain of rice.
</P>
<P>
   Other heralded visions that have still not yielded real products
include fuel cells on a chip; minuscule implant pumps for extremely
accurate drug delivery; and battlefield surveillance systems small
enough to drift around like dust particles.
</P>
<P>
   But if some of the most dazzling visions have yet to
materialize, many technology experts continue to foresee a
revolutionary role for MEMS. MEMS have recently shown up in devices
as diverse as movie projectors, DNA analysis kits, braking systems
and airspeed indicators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The field is diversifying very rapidly,'' said William
Trimmer, vice president of technology for Standard MEMS, a MEMS
maker in Burlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, if manufacturers of MEMS switches show they have
successfully met the telecommunications industry's demanding
standards for reliability, programs to develop other MEMS products
should encounter less skepticism, predicts David Honey, photonics
program manager for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
of the Defense Department, which has been a major financer of MEMS
research.
</P>
<P>
   One big challenge for MEMS is that while the devices are often
made with the same equipment and methods as are microprocessors,
they have to be designed and packaged differently for every new
application. As a result, most of the scores of products already on
the market have been aimed at narrow niches. And only a handful are
currently profitable, according to Roger H. Grace, a San Francisco
consultant who has tracked MEMS businesses for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The bumpy path MEMS have taken from the laboratory to commerce
might have been predictable. Lasers and robots _ two other
inventions that inspired dreams of transforming the world _ took a
similar route.
</P>
<P>
   Even though lasers are now everywhere _ used in scanners,
medical equipment and home entertainment devices like CD players _
only a handful of the companies that made lasers managed to grow
into publicly held ventures, and none of them became household
names among investors.
</P>
<P>
   Robotics is commonplace today in industrial applications like
assembly, welding, painting and packaging, but most of the major
pioneers went bankrupt, or survive as small divisions or affiliates
of companies like General Electric or ThyssenKrupp of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   MEMS manufacturers see a potential home run in switches because
fiber optics has become the backbone of modern communications
networks, with pulses of light representing the off-and-on binary
code of digital information.
</P>
<P>
   Without MEMS, directing those light pulses toward their
destination and balancing the traffic has required converting the
light to electrons at network junctions, routing the electrons
through switches, then translating them back into lightwaves to
continue down their new path. The new MEMS devices can eliminate
this double translation process by enabling the switching station
to simply bounce the light signals to their new network pathway.
</P>
<P>
   With companies talking about the need to keep up with Internet
traffic _ WorldCom says it must add the equivalent of its entire
1998 network every month by next year _ MEMS switches could become
a billion-dollar market by 2003, according to industry analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Communications companies say MEMS switches are attractive not
just for their reduced power demands and compact size but for
``scalability.'' Currently, when a fiber optic cable carrying
dozens of different wavelengths of light reaches an electronic
switch, each wavelength must take a different path through the
switch. As optical cables evolve to handle more and more
wavelengths, which is crucial in expanding capacity, electronic
switches must be reconfigured or replaced. But the newest MEMS
switches, once installed, can redirect 10 wavelengths or hundreds
without needing to be changed or expanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Holy Grail has been to put something in the network that
has a long life span,'' said Jack Wimmer, vice president for
network technology and planning at WorldCom, adding that MEMS
devices could be widely deployed next year if they prove to be
reliable in testing this year.
</P>
<P>
   The simplest MEMS switches are like gates. When the mirror is in
its open position, the signal passes through uninterrupted; when it
pivots or is pushed into the signal path, the signal is deflected.
</P>
<P>
   The limitation in such designs is that each mirror in the array
pivots on a single axis. That means everything must be switched to
destinations in a single plane. Picture a flat city grid with every
avenue having a pop-up barrier at each intersection, capable of
diverting traffic down any side streets. The traffic can be
rerouted, but only on the plane of the city's streets.
</P>
<P>
   A newer, somewhat more expensive design uses arrays of
pinhead-size mirrors that can pivot on two axes simultaneously. The
forward-backward tilt can be controlled separately from the
left-right tilt. The tilting is controlled by electrical charges,
but the principle is the same as in the children's game in which
one tries to roll a ball past holes and through a maze by using two
knobs to control the pitch of the playing surface. Instead of a
mirror at every intersection, each avenue now has a single mirror
that can direct traffic to multiple destinations in more than one
plane.
</P>
<P>
   In principle, such switches could be easily scaled up to direct
thousands of incoming signals to thousands of destinations. In
practice, since many signals at different wavelengths are traveling
simultaneously down each fiber, the MEMS package requires a device
that separates the arriving wavelengths and directs each to a
different mirror so that it can be switched to its specific
destination. The system also requires a similar device to intercept
and rebundle the switched signals so that each outgoing fiber also
carries as many different wavelengths as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The development challenges and the absence, so far, of a
successful track record mean that MEMS could once again fail to
live up to expectations. And the makers of MEMS optical switches
risk confusing customers with their competing designs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two or three will emerge as the industry standard in time, but
I expect seven or eight to be out there next year,'' said Kathleen
C. Szelag, vice president for marketing for Lucent's Optical
Networking Group.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, electronic processors continue to plummet in price
and increase in speed, which means that the electronic switching
technology that MEMS designers hope to supplant is far from
obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   MEMS will also have to compete with other optical technologies.
Agilent Technologies, a subsidiary of Hewlett-Packard, surprised a
major optical products trade show in Baltimore in March with a new
system capable of switching wavelengths of light from one fiber to
another by bouncing them off bubbles in a grid of liquid. Tiny
changes in heat cause the bubbles to form or disappear in 5
milliseconds. The grid can handle 512 wavelengths simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   MEMS advocates say the bubble technology has several drawbacks,
including a need for much more power. But investors apparently
listened to the company's case that similar technology had proved
to be reliable for years in Hewlett-Packard's bubble-jet printers
and could be easily manufactured. Agilent's stock soared 47 percent
the day after the announcement. Alcatel of France, Europe's
second-largest telecommunications equipment company, has signed an
agreement to work on developing the bubble technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very interested in MEMS, but we are also talking with
vendors of about half a dozen other optical switching
technologies,'' said Wimmer of WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   If MEMS switches take over the market the next few years, it may
be just in time for their creators to start worrying about yet
another competitor for their flexible mirrors and other chip-based
machines. In the field of nanotechnology, researchers have already
begun exploring the theoretical advantages of far smaller devices
built from handfuls of atoms and molecules. If their work pans out,
the next step could be switches and other machines invisible to the
naked eye.

 &HT;    PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS NOW FILTERED THROUGH INTERNET SCREEN
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The rise of the Internet and nonstop news cycles
has repaved the road to the White House, press secretaries for the
defunct presidential campaigns of Bill Bradley and Sen. John McCain
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the big changes brought on by online access to
campaigns, television still remains the best way to connect with
the voters, the bipartisan post-mortem by the two primary
contenders concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can talk all you want about the new media,'' said Eric
Hauser, former press secretary for Bradley's Democratic campaign.
``But the Internet is critically important because it is a way to
raise money. And you use that money to purchase television time.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Opinsky, press secretary for McCain's Republican
campaign, which the Arizona senator effectively ended in late
February, noted that ``because you can see everything on line, that
speeds up the whole pace of the echo chamber.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result,'' Opinsky said, ``I can see now what's in the
Dayton Daily News at six o'clock in the morning. And that ensures
that practically every newspaper in America to some extent has as
much reach as the traditional national news outlets.''
</P>
<P>
   The workshop itself was an Internet event, available via a live
interactive video stream on CNN's allpolitics.com Web site. It was
sponsored by the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and
Public Policy of Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of
Government, in collaboration with CNN.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, both staffers said, the two insurgent campaigns
differed in the way their candidates interacted with the press.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, Opinsky recalled, had spent many years building friendly
relations with Washington reporters _ an unusual tactic in the
post-Reagan era of presidential campaigns, where campaign
appearances and candidate accessibility is usually carefully
scripted and tightly controlled.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main job on the Straight Talk Express'' campaign bus, he
said, ``was to stay out of the way. ... It often proved hard to
talk to the senator about strategy because reporters were always
there.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's surprisingly good primary showing in New Hampshire on
Feb. 1 brought in $15 million on line in the next few days, ``which
was immediately put to good use buying more TV time,'' Opinsky
said. ``Before the Internet came of age, we could never have done
that,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Hauser's challenge was to overcome Bradley's image as an aloof
figure.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, as both the former New Jersey senator and his top
press aide see it, candidates shouldn't have friendly relationships
with reporters, but rather maintain a certain professional
distance.
</P>
<P>
   Another panelist, Jake Tapper of Salon.com, one of a new breed
of online political journalists, said that because of the immediacy
of the Internet, Bradley's stiff attitude came across to potential
voters more quickly that it might have in previous years.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaign officials voiced concern over how far the four
major TV networks had scaled back their coverage of presidential
campaigns and the coming political conventions, often relegating
their coverage to their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they said, the current spate of cable-driven political
coverage appeals largely to ``junkies'' or political insiders
rather than educating the public about vital issues.

 &HT;    If impact printer makes you happy, just keep using it
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mail from the Windows refuseniks continues rolling in,
both the sweet and the surly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your attitude is typical for the crowd with more money than
sense,'' announces a fellow defending impact printers. He may be
right, but I have so little of either it's hard to tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Panasonic dot-matrix (printer) works with Windows in about
70 percent of the things I need to do, even on graphics without
color. It's faster under DOS than Windows 98, even, and still
faster than Windows driving a HP Deskjet. Please give me a GOOD
reason for discarding it in favor of a slower, more expensive
printer for all my printing.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, there's that other 30 percent that goes unmentioned in
your diatribe. Further, I never suggested you discard anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you have a tech department to keep upgrading your
equipment and to sort out difficulties, so it costs you personally
little to play the `keep up with Joneses' game.''
</P>
<P>
   Not hardly, and I've never been able to keep up with the
Joneses. The Hatfields or the McCoys, perhaps, but not the Joneses.
And insofar as expense goes, I believe we paid about $550 for our
last dot-matrix printer. You can get an inkjet printer that does a
vastly superior job now for $150 or so.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, inkjets are a lot more expensive to run, and if you
need to do a lot of printing, then a laser is the way to go. But if
you've got an impact printer that does what you need to do, then
far be it from me to suggest you trash it.
</P>
<P>
   Another, gentler fellow reports that ``My wife and adult kids
keep after me to get a new setup rather than just upgrade my old
box and to get the latest Microsoft programs. I don't need 'em.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first computer was an Osborne which included SuperCalc,
WordStar and that big database. I now use Q&AMP;A and just keep
upgrading the spreadsheet and the word processor.''
</P>
<P>
   You mean Q&AMP;A is still around? A fine program it was (or is),
too. My first computer was a Morrow, which of course ran the same
miserable operating system as your Osborne _ CP/M. I've never felt
the same about spreadsheets since I found I couldn't get more than
about a dozen rows of eight cells each into its 64K memory.
</P>
<P>
   And you remember that wonderful Wordstar Catch-22? You'd be
typing along on the Great American Novel, tell it to save your
work, and if you had been careless about watching your floppy disk
space (no hard drives then) it would report there wasn't enough
room to save your work.
</P>
<P>
   Fine. Put in a new disk, save to that. Oh, WordStar wouldn't let
you do that. You had to use the disk you'd been working with. You,
my friend, were out of space and out of luck, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate Microsoft because Windows will not allow me to put my
DOS menu program as the first screen when starting,'' this
gentleman continues.
</P>
<P>
   Now, really. That's like hating ``Frankenstein Meets the
Wolfman'' because Bela Lugosi wasn't in it, or loathing Dvorak's
9th Symphony because it doesn't sound like Beethoven's Sixth. Of
course it doesn't allow you to put your DOS menu in place of the
desktop. It's supposed to replace your DOS menu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will use my old DOS WordStar to write most of the copy for
my Rotary Club's 144-page catalog for our upcoming Artists of
America Gala Sale and Exhibition,'' he concludes.
</P>
<P>
   You, sir, are hopeless. But I admire you, just as I have a
sneaking admiration for those hardy souls who not only still smoke,
but roll their own.
</P>
<P>
   From Denver comes a note from a fellow puzzled by the recent
report from a PFS Professional File user who said his current date
function now always produces something in the year 1900. His PFS,
he said, prefers the year '27, in an unspecified century.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Finally comes a kind gentleman offering relief to the fellow who
is using a Leading Edge word processing program and was trying to
find an old version of Word for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Vandiver says he can probably help you. Get in touch with

 &HT;    Net is revolutionary, but doesn't change life's basics
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You'd think, from reading the newspaper and listening
to the TV, that the Internet has changed everything. There are new
rules for marketers. The way we communicate with friends and
co-workers is changing. In short, the Internet has been a
combination of the hydrogen bomb, the Salk vaccine for polio and
Mother Teresa.
</P>
<P>
   The temptation with any important new technology is to stop
seeing shades of gray and to assume _ because it is new _ that
everything we knew up until then is wrong. So, depending on what
you do for a living, you may think that newspapers as we know them
will vanish, retail stores will become little more than kiosks
where you'll order things from the Internet, doctors will make
house calls by telecommunicating to your computer, and life will
become so virtual that it will be hard to tell if it's Uncle Fred
or Memorex.
</P>
<P>
   Look, the Internet is a big deal. It has changed things, but
it's shortsighted, naive and human to think it has somehow
short-circuited common sense. In fact, there's strong evidence for
the argument that _ now that the hysteria is dying some _ the old
rules haven't been suspended at all.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with e-commerce. Two years ago, you were being told
that starting any kind of a dot-com was like having a license to
print money. And the stock market and venture capitalists bore that
out. Twentysomethings started dot-coms right and left, became
millionaires, and their stunning successes indicated that commerce
was forever changed. Nowadays, you are seeing some of these
companies fall out of favor as Rule One of the marketplace begins
to reassert itself: Sooner or later you have to make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the e-commerce boom, there were serious and dark
worries that the Internet would somehow destroy society _ with
mankind crawling back into caves, this time into electronic ones.
Instead of going out to eat, we'd munch cold pizza by the computer
monitor; instead of holding conversations with each other, we'd
have computer chats; and reality itself would blur as the
difference between a real person and a virtual human narrowed.
</P>
<P>
   But the last time I went to a restaurant, I had to wait for a
table. The last time I was at a movie, I saw real people holding
hands. The Internet has become _ as it should have _ just another
way to talk, another way to set a date for the movies. Sure, there
are people who live online, but before the Internet there were
people who lived on the phone. There have always been people who
overdo things, people who don't have healthy lives. It's possible
to get lost in a virtual world, but most of us are still doing fine
living our lives out where the sun shines.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. The Internet is a big deal, is changing
business and society, but _ as during the time of the advent of the
telephone network _ those changes are mostly taking place within
the framework of the world that already existed.
</P>
<P>
   Stop for a moment and tell me one brand new thing the Internet
has delivered. Maybe you download your music from the Internet now
instead of buying a CD.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you order the Fruit-of-the-Month Club from the Web page
instead of the catalog ... but the sounds are just as enticing, the
fruit just as sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Life goes on. You can tell me how the Internet has speeded up
things; you can explain how it has offered new avenues for
commerce, new ways to talk to each other, or how it has made the
world smaller and easier to navigate.
</P>
<P>
   But unless you have a brand-new notion that I haven't heard, I
don't expect to hear of any fundamental shift in life as we know
it.
</P>
<P>
   So if you've been worrying that you'd have to reinvent your
business or yourself, stop worrying. Life is still good.

 &HT;    How to remove Explorer 5.5
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I downloaded Explorer 5.5 and tried it. I no longer wish to use
it. Besides reformatting the hard drive, how do I get rid of it?
</P>
<P>
   _Jim Huntley, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Others are asking, too. Instead of listing the steps for
uninstalling Explorer 5.5 on a PC, we'll steer you to www.help.com.
Click the Internet Explorer link. You'll find a link to uninstall
using the Add/Remove program from your Control Panel. Microsoft's
Web site (www.microsoft.com) also tells how to use Add/Remove to
delete Explorer. Type Explorer 5.5 in the search bar. At the bottom
of the next page, click on ``Next 10 Results (11-20)'' link. See
``How to Uninstall Internet Explorer 5.5.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Installing an application can put files everywhere,
making the bits and pieces hard to find. Control panels,
extensions, preferences, etc., may have names you wouldn't
associate with the app.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Look for utilities to help uninstall unwanted apps or to
keep a hard drive lean and mean. For the PC, check out Uninstaller
from CyberMedia or CleanSweep Deluxe. And for our Mac loyalists,
Tri-Cleaner 2.02 or SpringCleaning from Aladdin Systems. There are
more. Do your homework.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I'm on Windows 95 and use Internet Explorer. I set Explorer to
reject cookies, but an annoying message keeps asking if I want to
allow them. I click ``No'' repeatedly. It's tiresome. Can you turn
it off? How do you reject cookies without getting a message?
</P>
<P>
   _Marie McIntyre, Monroe, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Browsers have preference settings to let you pick between
always accepting cookies, getting a prompt before accepting
cookies, or blocking them. (Newer browsers have more cookie control
options.) Perhaps your browser is set to prompt you, and that's why
it asks permission. Be aware, some sites won't let you visit if you
disable cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: What are cookies exactly? What they are NOT is edible. No
chocolate chips or sugary sprinkles. Cookies are saved to a text
file on your hard drive and contain information a Web site gathers
from you. They help the Web site recognize you the next time you
drop by. Cookies can save you from retyping a user ID or password,
and they remember on-line purchases. They also track surfing habits
and are used for marketing research.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Making Web life easier is one thing, but some think cookies
muck with your privacy. There are steps you can take if you have
privacy concerns or want to trash cookie clutter. You can delete
your cookie file. It's called cookies.txt on Windows and
MagicCookie on a Mac. Of course, your browser creates a new, empty
one each time.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Freeware and shareware are available to manage and filter
cookies, too. We came across Internet JunkBuster Proxy, Cookie
Crusher and Cookie Pal for the PC, and Cookie Monster, Cookie
Cutter and WebFree for the Mac.

 &HT;    As download beat goes on, recording industry fights back
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The online music revolution will not be televised.
</P>
<P>
   It's being played out right now on the Web and in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   As you read this, thousands, possibly millions, of college
students and other music lovers are downloading recorded music from
the Beatles to the Backstreet Boys from digital download sites such
as MP3.com, or using file-sharing software called Napster
(www.napster.com).
</P>
<P>
   Like Amazon.com, which scored its early success because it was
able to offer a variety of books that no brick-and-mortar store
could stock, the sheer volume of recorded music available on the
Internet is staggering. Digital download fans can pick and choose
and make their own personal music collections.
</P>
<P>
   And every last track, from every last artist, is free _ for the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   One student recently told MTV she never buys music anymore, that
she and her roommate just download the songs they want from the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody really knows what to do about this. Artists don't want to
alienate their fans, but they do want to make money.
</P>
<P>
   But while music junkies are loading up on their favorite tunes
from MP3.com or Napster, they are bypassing traditional methods of
buying music. They are clogging university networks uploading and
downloading songs. And even though bands like U2 seem to be in the
music business just to fight for human rights and world peace, at
the end of the day, they still want a paycheck. With the digital
download situation as it now stands, that could be endangered.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the parties involved, the Recording Industry Association
of America is the most upset, the most vocal and the most
litigious. The RIAA filed lawsuits against both Napster and MP3.com
for copyright infringement. On April 28, it won a key victory when
a federal judge said MP3.com had violated industry copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is potentially disastrous for MP3.com. The RIAA is
asking for damages that could exceed $6 billion. The New York Post
reported last week that the RIAA is willing to settle with MP3.com
for a cool $100 million. Some reports indicate MP3.com isn't
willing to settle.
</P>
<P>
   But while MP3.com and Napster slug it out in court, users are
still downloading music in higher numbers every day. Lars Ulrich,
drummer for the heavy metal band Metallica, personally delivered a
list of 335,435 Napster users Metallica claims have illegally
obtained the band's music online.
</P>
<P>
   Artists and record companies call this pirating. Users call it
downloading.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Rosenbloum, an entertainment attorney and vice president
of business affairs for the Web site ArtistDirect (www.
artistdirect.com), says downloading even one song to play while
you're surfing the Web is a violation of fair-use laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are four factors of fair use,'' Rosenbloum says. ``The
purpose of the work, the nature of the use, the amount of the work
that was taken and whether the use undermines the market for the
original. Whether (digital downloads) undermine the market for the
original is characterized as the most important factor in these
decisions, and its easy to understand why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Napster,'' he continues. ``The ultimate goal of that
company is business. One day, there will be an advertising model.
Even though they don't post the files (Napster allows users to
share their digital files with other users who are logged on at the
same time), the creative works that are available would be worthy
of the highest degree of protection under copyright law. Most
people looking at this would say it very clearly undermines the
market potential for the original.''
</P>
<P>
   For the average, normally law-abiding computer user busy
downloading music, it's time to install that cable modem or
high-speed phone line and get moving if you want to get some free
tunes.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbloum says the major recording labels are working out their
own plans to enter the fray. And once they get online, digital
music is going to cost you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what you are going to start seeing over the next six
months is an increasing willingness on the part of the major labels
to compete with what's going on out there,'' Rosenbloum says. ``You
will see continued use of legislation and a combined effort by all
of the major labels to come up with a combined business model to
combat the illegal uses we are seeing now. ``
</P>
<P>
   Even though the RIAA is determined to take its case through the
legal system, Rosenbloum says he's not sure legislation is the
right way to attack this issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an outspoken critic of legislation,'' he says. ``Often the
best solution to a conflict is by discussion, negotiation and
mediation. But sometimes legislation is your only option if one
side or the other won't compromise _ especially in this very
complicated area.''

 &HT;    Computing in style
 &HT;    By Mary Jo DiLonardo
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Long gone are the days when it was cool to set up your
computer in a dank, musty corner of the basement on an
easy-to-assemble wobbly desk from Kmart.
</P>
<P>
   As more and more people are getting home PCs, the computer is
attaining the status of the television set in American homes.
Currently, more than half of all U.S. families has at least one
computer somewhere in the house. With that number growing at an
incredible pace, having a computer is like having a TV. The
question now is where do you put it?
</P>
<P>
   Computer owners seem to be doing one of two things. They're
either proudly displaying their desktop on fancy, gadget-filled
desks or they're hiding it deep within the bowels of elaborate
armoire-like furniture pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``As more people are splitting their time between the home and
office, it's no longer 'Let me just throw it on the kitchen
table','' says local interior designer Jerry Poole. ``People are
getting computer-related furniture.''
</P>
<P>
   Although you can still buy plenty of functional computer desks
at discount stores for less than $100, furniture designers have
jumped on the booming popularity of home PCs and home offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several of our furniture lines have specifically addressed
furniture that is strictly for computers,'' says Custer Mayor of
Mayo Wholesale Furniture in northwest Atlanta. While this furniture
may look like a simple entertainment center, chest or desk, it's
specifically designed for computers with room for a tower,
keyboard, monitor and all the wiring, says Mayo.
</P>
<P>
   According to trend guru Faith Popcorn's BrainReserve marketing
firm, the number of at-home workers has increased by 100 percent in
the last five years to 10.5 million people. That number is expected
to double by 2005. While an estimated 40 percent of all employers
now offer telecommuting, one in eight of all households already has
a full time at-home worker.
</P>
<P>
   Popcorn _ who coined the term ``cocooning'' and was dubbed the
``Nostradamus of marketing'' by Fortune magazine _ has even
ventured into the home office furniture design business herself.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that women are leaving corporate America and
starting their own businesses at twice the rate of men, Popcorn
designed a line of home office furniture designed specifically for
women. There are two collections in her inaugural line _ the
feminine and traditional La Cocoon and the hipper, clean-lines of
Satellite.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being more attractive than just a basic computer
desk, the lines include special touches designed to appeal to women
including a locking compartment for purses and other personal
items, a built-in bud vase and felt-lined jewelry trays for women
who may take off their earrings when they pick up the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Popcorn designed the desks higher than usual because, she says,
women tend to cross their legs while they're sitting. In addition,
there's a stepstool that can double as a child's desk to keep the
tykes occupied when Mom is working at home.
</P>
<P>
   Popcorn's furniture ranges from $450 for the stepstool to $4,500
for a desk/credenza. Obviously, these new computer furniture pieces
are far from cheap. Milling Road, a division of the upscale Baker
Furniture Company, for example, offers an impressive leather-top
desk that retails for an even more awe-inspiring $9,262.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customer is often the executive person _ usually between
30 and 50 _ who started his own business out of his home,'' says
Milling Road lead designer Joe McCambridge. ``He doesn't want to
work off a piece of plywood desk. He wants something that will
impress his customers.''
</P>
<P>
   This desk should do the trick. Complete with a drop front
keyboard drawer, hidden space for computer towers and printers, the
maple desk is 18th century Italian design, says McCambridge.
(Milling Road furniture is available locally at Beverly Hall
Furniture Galleries, Matthews and Flack's Interiors.) It's
obviously a step way above the basic metal job you can pick up at
an office supply story.
</P>
<P>
   How much people spend on their computer furniture seems to
depend on where they plan on putting it, designers and retailers
agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're putting it in a space in their house where they
entertain _ like the living room _ then they spend more so they can
conceal it,'' says Poole. ``If it's going in their basement or
bedroom where generally people won't see it, then they spend just
several hundred dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   For people who don't want to look at their PC when they're not
using it, a few furniture companies have designed serious
armoire-like pieces to conceal the computer when it's not in use.
</P>
<P>
   ``To look at it from three feet away you think it's just a nice
piece of furniture,'' says Mayo. ``But then doors come open and
drawers open and trays come out. It's ingenious.''
</P>
<P>
   As people spend more time at home on their computers, they want
their home office to resemble their work office in many respects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clients want more than just a writing desk. They want a desk
like they would have in their office with all the file drawers,
keyboard trays and other details but with styling that is
appropriate to their home in quality and styling,'' says
Minneapolis interior designer Sue Walling. ``They want their home
office to function just like their office outside the home would.''
</P>
<P>
   For people with beaucoup bucks to spend, designers like Walling
often design a set-up to meet their clients' needs. Some people,
for example, want televisions and stereo equipment built into their
office cabinetry.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, people now want their home offices to be
convenient, comfortable and practical too. Says Walling, ``It is
passe to think a home office only needs to look good.''

 &HT;    Portable DVD is just grand _ actually, $1,300
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   If you love your DVD collection and can't stand to be without
your movies when you travel, the Sharp DV-L70U ($1,300,
www.sharp-usa.com) is an excellent way to view them in style. With
a 7-inch LCD display that produces clear, vibrant images on an
anti-glare screen and good sound, the DV-L70U will play DVDs, Video
CDs and standard audio CDs. It has inputs and outputs for
displaying from other sources or outputting to your home system
with digital sound if you want to use it as a standard DVD player.
Boasting a battery life of about three hours on a single charge,
the portable player lives up to its main purpose: With headphones,
it's the ultimate in-flight gadget. But with the cost of standard
DVD players dipping below $200, the price just doesn't seem right.
Still, if DVDs are your game, the Sharp portable DVD player is a
phenomenal product and a great way to organize your own personal
screening.

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   You've heard it said of Pokemon that fans ``gotta catch 'em
all.'' Moving with their runaway hit _ which is also the only thing
keeping Nintendo's sales numbers high and mighty above third-rate
game developer status _ the Pokemon craze culminates with Pokemon
Stadium ($60; www. nintendo.com; for the Nintendo 64) by offering a
new way to corral the hard-earned, dutifully nurtured bubble-gum
characters. Essentially useless without the GameBoy Color companion
piece, Stadium comes bundled with a ``Transfer Pak'' and allows for
traded and trained GBC Red, Blue and/or Yellow Poke-characters to
migrate and play together in multiplayer arena games and trading
modes. But without a GBC from which to migrate, Stadium is a
lightweight romp without reward and not conducive to the ``catch,
train and trade 'em all'' phenomenon _ while Nintendo takes your
money in a whole new way. Fans rejoice while everyone else rolls
their eyes and wonders when the craze will end _ or, better said,
if the craze will end: Pokemon Stadium has already sold well over a
million copies.
</P>
<P>
   A MOUSE-HAVE FOR KIDDOS
</P>
<P>
   Kutoka's Mia: The Search for Grandma's Remedy ($40;
www.kutoka.com; for PC and Mac with QuickTime) displays
conscientiousness toward childhood education while still retaining
playfulness. Designed for kids ages 5 and up, players guide a cute
little mouse named Mia through a resplendent 3-D cartoon
environment via simple mouse/cursor control. Mia's simple quest to
fetch a few ingredients is complicated by various puzzles and
simple games encountered along the way. It is always pleasant,
slow-paced and easy to understand. Mia side-scrolls through most of
the adventure, though she also has some freedom of movement through
the foreground and background as she chases the cursor wherever it
may be and interacts with other characters or objects as they are
clicked while talking to and encouraging the game player. The one
flaw might be the lack of distinction between scenery and
interactive icons on the screen, but it's a tiny issue. Yet another
wee scholarly endeavor that makes learning fun.

 &HT;    NHL Rock the Rink is action packedBy Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   Put a bunch of beer-league WWF drop-outs from the Marty McSorley
School of Hockey up against downsized NHL teams of goons and
power-players and you've got NHL Rock the Rink ($40; www.ea.com;
for the Sony PlayStation), a gloriously over-the-top,
three-on-three version of the coolest game on Earth, where there's
as much action after the whistle as there is during play. Monster
hits and checks, stick swinging and body slams punctuate impossible
play and super moves. Graphics are notably chunky and blotchy, as
we've come to expect on the outmoded Sony console, but the
intensity of gameplay more than makes up for the base presentation.
Riddled with overly enthusiastic color-commentary, Vancouver's
local sports personality, Don Taylor (along with a Don Cherry
sound-alike) keeps the laughs coming with improbable remarks such
as ``ludicrous save!'' or, after a particularly nasty hit, ``Oh!
The athletic protector comes through when it counts!'' Lots of
long-term aggression-letting and a definite ``party game'' for two
players at a time.
</P>
<P>
   In its last incarnation, ``Nemesis'' for the Sony Playstation,
the Resident Evil videogame series was starting to look like it was
on its last, decomposing zombie legs. Leave it to the Sega
Dreamcast and Capcom to pump some new blood into the series with
Resident Evil: Code Veronica ($50, www.capcom.com), a breathtaking
survival horror game that takes the best elements of the series and
adds the horsepower of the Dreamcast. Following heroine Claire
Redfield, you explore dynamically lit environments, gunning through
zombies, rabid dogs and exquisite cinematic scenes. Other
enhancements include the ability to carry more than one weapon for
that John Woo effect, an enhanced map system and, of course, much
better graphics. The best of the Resident Evil games, Code Veronica
has been keeping us up late, itching for more.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   Coming in at roughly $1.26 per game, Hasbro Interactive's Atari
Arcade Hits ($20; www.hasbrointeractive. com) offers retro gaming
at its finest. Twelve arcade ``classics'' (some bona fide
masterpieces, some instantly forgettable) in a desktop arcade are
included _ a quick trip down memory lane when games were
simplistic, pure and downright addictive. Blockbuster games like
Asteroids and the superior sequel, Asteroids Deluxe, are emulated
faithfully _ save for the fact that a keyboard cannot, by nature,
offer the same rapid fire of the original hair-trigger buttons.
Likewise, Centipede and its follow-up, Millipede, or the stalwart
Missile Command, were originally designed for a track-ball
interface, though a frightfully fast mouse such as the Razer
Boomslang 2000 does afford speed twitch effect otherwise
unrealized. Other ``hits'' such as the original, vector-beam
Battlezone and Gravitar not only stand the test of time but also
offset the otherwise dreary drudgery of Crystal Castles, Warlords
and the woefully plain Pong.

 &HT;    Numerous sites offering legal help

<P>
   ATLANTA _ You needn't have a ski mask and a sawed-off shotgun to
come into contact with the legal system.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans have an occasional brush with the law _ whether
it comes from buying a new home, getting a divorce, settling a
small-claims court issue, making a will, incorporating a small
business or forming a business partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Most lawyers would _ understandably and logically enough _
recommend that each of these issues be handled by a legal
professional. But even if you plan to consult a lawyer, it's smart
to educate yourself beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the World Wide Web can offer an astonishing amount
of legal help.
</P>
<P>
   By far one of the best and most comphrehensive legal sites is
called Nolo.com (www.nolo.com).
</P>
<P>
   Especially worthwhile is a section called the Legal Encyclopedia
at www.nolo.com/encyclopedia/index.html. The name is a bit
misleading since, instead of essays and definitions, you'll find
well-reasoned self-help tips divided by categories, such as child
custody, purchasing a car, traffic court, small-claims court, debt
collections and bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the sort of advice you can expect, in this case about
deciding whether to file a lawsuit: ``You need to answer three
fundamental _ and fairly obvious _ questions as part of deciding
whether it's worthwhile to bring a lawsuit: 1. Do I have a good
case? 2. Can I achieve my goal in some other way _ for example, by
proposing a compromise settlement or mediation? 3. Assuming a
lawsuit is my best or only option, can I collect when I win?''
</P>
<P>
   This site takes good advantage of the interactivity possible on
the Web. For instance, if you decide to follow the compromise or
mediation route, you'll be able to read detailed information on
those options.
</P>
<P>
   Mediation is increasingly important these days as a way to
settle a legal issue outside the court system but with the aid of
impartial professionals. There is great information on that topic
at a site called Mediation Issues at adrr.com/adr1/. Among many
other topics on this page, you'll find links that will help you
learn about the ethics of mediation, its pitfalls, the sort of
credentials a mediator needs and mediation's place in family law.
</P>
<P>
   FindLaw.com at www.findlaw.com/ is an especially practical site.
There are links from there to sections that will help you find a
lawyer with the skills needed for your case, as well as sections on
constitutional, intellectual property and labor law. Lawyers can
use the site to learn more about professional development courses
and seminars and to take advantage of the case law and expert
witness sections.
</P>
<P>
   Another rich trove of legal information can be found at a site
called the 'Lectric Law Library Laypeople's Legal Lounge at
www.lectlaw.com/lay.html. While the name may be a little unwieldy,
the information is not.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find more links to topics than can be listed here, but
among them are areas on Civil Procedure Outline, Handling Your Own
Injury Claim, How to Fight Your Traffic Ticket, Lawyers' Billing
Abuses, Keeping Legal Fees Down During a Divorce and Finding a Free
or Reduced-Cost Lawyer. Finally, if you have more than a passing
interest in the law, you'll want to check out the site called
Current Events _ Law at law.about.com/newsissues/law/. You'll be
able to read news stories that examine the legal issues in the
news. For instance, last week there were stories about possibly
normalizing relations with Cuba and the legal issues surrounding
assisted suicide.

 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER 
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    George W. Bush had just nailed down the Republican Party's
presidential nomination with his Super Tuesday primary victories,
and in Texas it was a night to celebrate. Yet the winner's top
strategist, Karl Rove, moved uncomfortably through the victory bash
at the Four Seasons in Austin that evening.
 &HT;    ``The king has arrived!'' someone shouted at Rove, and the king
winced. When Michael Levy, the publisher of Texas Monthly, knelt
before him with a flourish and pretended to kiss his ring, Rove
turned around, bent over at the waist and hiked up his jacket. As
in, ``Kiss this.''
 &HT;    Rove was laughing, of course. Everyone was. But bristling, too,
not so far underneath, at even this celebratory moment. When I
asked him if he was enjoying himself, he said no. ``Boring, man,
boring,'' he yelled, raising his voice to make himself heard.
 &HT;    He didn't seem so much bored, though, as thrown by all the
attention _ particularly the positive stuff. As his wife, Darby,
later remarked, ``He knows they can turn on you at any time.''
 &HT;    It was Rove who hatched the whole concept of the Bush campaign,
starting with the parade of Republicans who showed up in Austin
begging the governor to run. But after Bush lost to Sen. John
McCain in New Hampshire and later in Michigan, there was widespread
panic among campaign contributors and plenty of grousing from Daddy
Bush's old team: what did this Rove really know about running a
national campaign?
 &HT;    The question hasn't gone away either. In his own party, he is
seen by many as both too inexperienced and too smitten by his
candidate to be of much use. Yet the story here is not ``Jethro
Runs a Presidential Campaign.''
 &HT;    In the last 20 years, Rove has run and won most every major
Republican campaign in Texas, and he has been relentless in the
service of his clients and their conservative cause. And if some of
his cutthroat, cowboy image is hype _ he is awfully eager to talk
about his old buddy Lee Atwater's profound influence on his life _
the least that can be said is that it's hype that has worked. In
Austin, his hometown, he is generally regarded as either: a) a
genius, or b) an evil genius, with a subspecialty in screaming,
over-the-top phone calls about perceived betrayals, usually of
George W.
 &HT;    When I started to ask him about the phone calls recently, he cut
me off: ``Somebody who had done the wrong thing with somebody I was
working for? You bet. Somebody out there bad-mouthing? You bet I'll
chew on them. You bet I get in their face.'' His anger is real
enough.
 &HT;    And when I brought up the talk about his experience being too
provincial, his response again was pretty macho: ``No, I haven't
run a national campaign, but who has? Jim Baker?'' This he said as
if being James Baker, who reluctantly ran President Bush's 1992
campaign, is maybe not such a good thing.
 &HT;    Rove said he would, of course, be bringing in reinforcements,
and already, a number of better-known operatives, including Haley
Barbour and Mary Matalin, have been hired to lend advice. Yet Rove
could not help adding, sneeringly: ``But do you repopulate the
campaign with people from 1908? No!''
 &HT;    There are other concerns about Rove: he cannot hope to maintain
airtight message control _ the hallmark of his earlier campaigns,
including W.'s gubernatorial runs _ in the circus atmosphere of a
presidential race. And quite possibly, Rove's arrogance and his
tendency to take politics personally are not the ideal check on
Bush's arrogance and tendency to take politics personally.
 &HT;    But Republicans can stop worrying that Karl Rove is too
down-home, laid-back, blissed out or otherwise insufficiently
aggressive for the job. At one point during that big evening at the
Four Seasons, Rove retreated to a hotel suite upstairs to crunch
numbers and monitor TV chat.
 &HT;    He phoned the Bush campaign's communications director, Karen
Hughes, to tell her what to say on the air. (Earlier, he had also
told her what to tell Bush to say.) Then he disappeared into the
bathroom with his cell phone to take a call from Bush.
 &HT;    Rove and his boss had been on the phone throughout the day, and
from his office at Bush central that afternoon, he gave Bush the
good news from the exit polls, taking special pleasure in the
McCain campaign ``meltdown,'' as he called it.
 &HT;    Just as Rove finished talking to Bush from the hotel bathroom
that evening, boisterous, good-natured Karen Hughes burst into the
suite, and Rove told her he just wanted to ``get New York over with
so we can go home.'' ``Go home?'' Hughes yelled. ``I want to
celebrate.'' Rove sighed, and she rubbed his shoulders for a
minute. ``Congratulations,'' she told him _ quietly, for her. As
in, could you try to enjoy it a little?
 &HT;    They hovered near the TV, and when Bush finally came on CNN,
Hughes marveled at how well he was performing. Rove, though, was
still frowning. And when Bernard Shaw asked the governor whether,
``if you were to win the delegates in California but lose the
popular vote,'' McCain might conceivably stay in the race, Rove
bellowed at the screen: ``Hey, what if we win both? Will you --''
Then he said something that was not ``kiss my ring.''
 &HT;    You won't be seeing any gauzy, feel-good clips from Karl Rove's
early life in a campaign video at the convention this summer. Dad _
his adoptive dad _ was gone a lot, working. Mom moved the family
around, restless. The kid missed him, fought with her. Finally Dad
left for good. On a Christmas Day, actually. Then Mom packed for
Reno. And later, when he was all grown up, she killed herself.
 &HT;    ``Nothing special about the Roves,'' Karl summed up defiantly
when asked some pap question about where he had grown up. (Answer:
Out West, Colorado mostly, though he went to high school in Salt
Lake City.) At 49, all round and successful and stressed out by the
right things now, Rove sat in his Austin office and looked back on
his younger self as a ``strange kid'' who grew into a ``big nerd,
complete with the pocket protector, briefcase, the whole deal.''
 &HT;    He loved history and books of all kinds, really, and spent most
of his free time in the library, preparing for his debating-team
competitions. His debating partner and best friend in Salt Lake
City, Mark Dangerfield, now an attorney in Phoenix, said that one
thing that really seemed to bother his friend back then was that
``he was raised in a completely nonreligious home.''
 &HT;    When I asked Rove about this, he said: ``I'm not sure I've ever
found faith. Others here'' _ others in the campaign, including
George W. _ ``I know how much their faith sustains them.'' At some
point, politics, conservative politics, became Rove's true religion
_ though his family wasn't Republican or in any way political, for
that matter.
 &HT;    And right from the beginning, he saw politics as a contact
sport: ``The little girl across the street I can remember beating
the hell out of me in 1960 because I was for Nixon and she was for
Kennedy. She had a couple of years and a few pounds on me, and I
can remember being on the pavement.'' He volunteered for one of the
campaigns of Wallace F. Bennett, the Utah senator, while still in
high school, and essentially he never came off the trail.
 &HT;    College was off and on: Rove began at the University of Utah in
1969, thinking of majoring in political science, but after his
parents split up during his freshman year, he says, ``I had to
start to fend for myself.'' To earn money for school, he worked in
a convenience store and was robbed at gunpoint. And he never did
get a degree, still a tender spot with him.
 &HT;    Darby Rove is a graphic artist who worked for her husband's
political direct-mail business before they were married, and over a
long lunch earlier this spring she was both admiring and bracingly
frank about him. She called him a creative genius and a committed
father to their 11-year-old son, Andrew, but also said he can be
fierce and quite intimidating, even when he's trying not to be.
 &HT;    It isn't only that he's always working, she said, but that
working for Republicans is the organizing principle of his life, at
the center of his world, which he tends to divide into friends and
foes. ``I told Karl the other day,'' she said, '''You see things in
black and white. I see lots of gray.'''
 &HT;    Rove does have a softer side; when I mentioned how much I had
liked his wife, who has had a long battle with breast cancer, his
eyes filled with tears. ``She is one of the most courageous people
I know,'' he said. But as she suggested, he does talk a lot about
the forces of good and evil. Even in the race he ran to head the
College Republicans in his early 20s, he and his allies were ``the
good guys'' and his opponent and his opponent's supporters were
``the bad guys.''
 &HT;    Atwater, his fellow College Republican, fixed it so that he'd
win that campaign, Rove says. Nothing too nefarious, though, just
charming some women, who even in that election turned out to be the
swing voters. Afterward, Rove hired Atwater to help him in the job,
his first real job. And they traveled the country together,
recruiting college kids. This was smack in the middle of Watergate
_ not exactly go-go years for campus Republicans.
 &HT;    But the thing that came across most plainly as Rove talked about
his work, then and now, is the sense that he is absolutely
unafraid. So is he like Atwater? ``I guess I'm more cerebral and
lack his great people skills,'' Rove said. ``And I'm more of a
nerd. Lee was a nerd in high school, but then he learned to play
the guitar and talk to girls, and I never did.'' They both met
George Bush in that job, of course, and his son George W., too. And
both Rove and Atwater ended up going to work for the elder Bush _
Rove down in Texas, where he has been ever since.
 &HT;    When I asked people who have worked with Rove in Texas what
makes a classic ``Karl campaign,'' they all used the same word:
control. He picks a few campaign themes and goes to great pains to
keep his candidates on message. A year before Bush first ran for
governor, against Ann Richards in 1994, he was invited to
participate in a little skit being put on by a Republican women's
group in Dallas, and Rob Allyn, a Republican consultant who was
working on the event, got a call from Rove.
 &HT;    ``He said Bush would make fun of himself, his mother or
whatever,'' Allyn recalled recently, ``but he would not under any
circumstances make fun of Ann Richards and would appear only on
that condition.''
 &HT;    There are also a lot of stories of Rove's bullying on behalf of
Bush. Frank Cahoon, one of the first Republicans ever elected to
the Texas House (he is now retired from politics and living in
Midland) heard from Rove after Cahoon openly disagreed with some of
the appointments Bush made upon being elected governor. He called
one Sunday night and went on for an hour, Cahoon recalled: ``Karl
was reading me the riot act as a traitor. I said, 'Who cares what
some old man out here in the desert thinks?'''
 &HT;    Rove also tries to keep the press in line. When an Austin
publication, The Lone Star Report, ran negative stories about the
governor's tax plan in 1997, Rove not only called to complain but
also yelled for 45 minutes straight. ``I was sitting 10 feet away''
from the guy who took the call, said the current managing editor,
David Guenthner, ``and I could hear every word.''
 &HT;    A friend of mine in Texas, Anne Marie Kilday, a former colleague
at The Dallas Morning News, says Rove called her at home early one
morning during Bush's race against Richards. Republicans had been
shopping a story about supposed malfeasance by a female state
official Kilday covered. According to Kilday, Rove said he was
looking over the telephone records of this official, who is a
lesbian, and said he found it interesting that there had been a
number of calls to Kilday from the official ``at your residence.''
Kilday recalled, ``He said, 'You've just got to be careful about
your reputation and what people might think.'''
 &HT;    When I asked Rove about the story without mentioning names, he
said: ``I have no recollection of that. I know exactly who it is,
though.'' The official's sexuality, he said, would have had nothing
to do with it. ``I would never have had that conversation,'' he
said.
 &HT;    Probably the weirdest story about Rove-related intrigue goes
back to 1986, when he was working for Bill Clements, a Republican
and a former governor, in his run against Gov. Mark White.
Literally hours before the two were supposed to debate for the
first and only time in that race, the big news broke that a
listening device had been discovered in Rove's office, hidden
behind a red, white and blue needlepoint of the GOP elephant.
 &HT;    An investigation came to nothing, but the incident infuriated
White's people, who accused Rove of planting the bug himself to
distract the White camp and muddy White's reputation at a crucial
moment.
 &HT;    Would Rove really have gone that far for a client? Probably not,
I had thought. But then I rented a movie he recommended, a Sidney
Lumet film, ``Power,'' about the high-flying, low-sinking life of
one really smart political consultant, played by Richard Gere.
 &HT;    ``I thought of myself as the Richard Gere character,'' Rove had
said wryly. ``You gotta rent this, it's so unbelievably stupid.
He's working for this guy who's a total schlump, and of course they
get the schlump elected governor.''
 &HT;    Rove's point, he made clear, was that Hollywood was wrong,
deliciously wrong. Because in real life, he believes, the schlumps
are generally found out. It's not such an unrealistic movie,
really, but I was surprised to watch as Gere's character discovers,
in the heat of a gubernatorial race ... that his office has been
bugged. And as it happens, the movie was released in 1986, the same
year Rove's office was said to have been bugged.
 &HT;    When I asked him about the coincidence, he laughed, then stopped
laughing and kind of cocked his head. Then he said, ``I don't have
any recollection of that.''
 &HT;    The feeling in the Bush camp seems to be that whatever Rove has
done has worked pretty well so far; he is fully in charge and
likely to remain so. Rove's friend Reggie Bashur, who has worked
for Bush in the past, probably summed it up best: ``They're
winning, so it's like that old saying, 'If it ain't broke, don't
fix it.'''

 By WARREN HOGE 
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    It was just an ordinary day in the life of Britain's most
prominent working couple when Cherie Blair dropped in unannounced
on her husband, Tony, the British prime minister, as he went about
the nation's business in his Downing Street office. Nothing
surprising about that.
 &HT;    The official residence sports a laid-back appearance these days,
with aides in shirt sleeves and loosened ties keeping up a lively
banter in the corridors of British power and the wife of the prime
minister frequently breezing past the busts of William Pitt and
Benjamin Disraeli on her way down from the family quarters
upstairs, out the famous black front door with the white numeral 10
and off to her job as one of London's top downtown lawyers.
 &HT;    But where Blair's opponents had been trying with scant success
for three years to catch the sure-footed British leader off
balance, it took his wife that September day only a few minutes.
``I was here at the desk writing my party conference speech,''
Blair recalls as a spring rain rattles against the windows. He
looks over at the simple leather-top table in his den-size space,
which is entirely free of flags and portraits or any other signs
that a world leader occupies it. ``And she came to me and said,
'I've got some news for you, and it's going to be rather shocking
about the family.' Well, I immediately thought there was something
wrong, that there was something wrong with our kids. She said there
was nothing wrong with the kids that we had.''
 &HT;    He lays emphasis on the last word with a roll of his eyes.
 &HT;    ``'But Tony, I think we're going to have another.' It was not a
moment to forget, but I do a little because I was so shocked.
Delighted, of course, but really shocked. I think I said, 'You're
joking,' and she said, 'No, I'm not.' I asked, you know, all the
usual questions. And I think I did get around to saying, 'That's
wonderful, darling.' But that was after a few minutes.''
 &HT;    This month Blair, 47, and Cherie, 45, are expecting their fourth
child and their first in 12 years, and the newcomer is presenting
Blair with a test right in his own home of his frequently voiced
notions of a new, improved, up-to-date, socially advanced, even
cool Britain. He is faced with widespread public anticipation that
he will take some of the paternity leave that his reform-minded
government has just made part of British law, and his modern-man
reputation is on the line.
 &HT;    It was his wife, who specializes in employment law, who first
raised the issue, calling the attention of a London legal forum to
the decision by Finland's prime minister, Paavo Lipponen, 59, to
spend a week at home in March with his newborn daughter. ``I, for
one, am promoting the widespread adoption of his fine example,''
she said.
 &HT;    All eyes turned to Blair, who has made family stability a
centerpiece of his mission to shed his country of its trappings of
tradition and turn it into a more contemporary society. In a
typical challenge, the National Childbirth Trust said, ``What Tony
Blair does when his baby is born will be a very powerful signal to
other men about what real men do.''
 &HT;    Real men. When I bring up the phrase Blair winces and shifts in
his chair. ``I know what people want me to say, but the truth is,
if I went away and stopped taking any calls or having any
conversations, it just wouldn't be real,'' he says. ``I'll take
more time off. I'll try to cut down on official things. You've got
to have some common sense about it. I mean, you want to spend more
time with your baby, but you don't give up the job. If people want
their politicians to be honest, they have to know I cannot stop
being prime minister. And it's usually my job to take care of
things at night anyway. Cherie has many excellent qualities, but
once she goes to sleep, it takes a minor nuclear explosion to wake
her up.''
 &HT;    The announcement itself in November was a bomb, instantly
propelling Blair free of a series of parliamentary squabbles,
cabinet disputes and gathering complaints about breakdowns in
public services that had prompted his Conservative rivals to
predict that at last his extended political honeymoon was coming to
an end. The arrival of the first baby to be born to a sitting prime
minister in 150 years is likely to give Blair's political fortunes
a fresh bounce despite some disappointing results in local
elections this month, affording him another of the repeated escapes
from real damage that have prompted the right-wing Daily Telegraph
to call him Teflon Tony.
 &HT;    Exercising his power in a personal manner more akin to an
American president than a British prime minister, Blair has become
the most closely observed and _ despite some vocal irritation these
days at his unchallenged dominance of British public life _ the
most popular prime minister in history. He is lionized by the
foreign politicians who pass through Whitehall and held up as a
model by most of continental Europe's leaders, who have
traditionally gazed across the channel with little interest in
adopting the quaint customs of the people who live there. He has
become a player on the world stage in what is very likely the first
act of a long run.
 &HT;    Opinion polls continue to show the Labor Party 20 points ahead
of the Conservatives, and the only question about the outcome of
the next election, expected a year from now, is how much Blair can
preserve of the 179-seat majority in Parliament he arrived with in
1997. He has attracted international attention as a reliable go-to
guy with some unflinching acts at moments marked by hesitation in
other Western capitals.
 &HT;    He was the first allied leader to pledge solidarity with
President Clinton after the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke, he was
the most outspoken advocate of NATO's bombing in Kosovo and he has
become the allies' point man with the new Russian president,
Vladimir Putin. When Putin looked for an introduction to the West
this spring, he rang up London. The two men exchanged summit visits
in St. Petersburg in March and in London in April, and the British
leader bestowed upon the Russian what amounts to a Blairite
benediction, the title he reserves for himself and his true
believers: ``modernizer.''
 &HT;    The transaction validated Blair's wish that modern Britain be
thought of as the pivotal nation bridging Europe, a continent he
says he wants to help lead, with the United States, a country he
says he doesn't mind following.
 &HT;    ``This is our great strength,'' he says. ``There's no doubt in
my mind that Britain has an important role with Europe and a strong
relationship with the United States, and the two complement each
other. I will wage perpetual war against the view that Britain
should choose America rather than Europe or Europe rather than
America. It is completely and utterly counterproductive for this
country.''
 &HT;    Blair freely admits taking a lot of leads from President
Clinton's politics, but he has led a distinctly different personal
life. There seem to be no embarrassments lurking in Blair's past or
imminent eruptions of shoddy conduct in his present. For people who
liked Clinton's promise but felt betrayed by his performance, Tony
Blair might just be their man.
 &HT;    Blair likes to measure his modernizing project in terms of
upgrading the country's technological prowess, stocking its skills
bank and keeping it on the front lines of global competition. But
the coming of a baby to 10 Downing Street is casting things in more
human terms. The progress of the mission may no longer be computed
in just gigabytes, new job opportunities and trade figures but in
less tangible things like the hours he devotes to his family, the
dinners he has at home, the school meetings he attends, the
postnatal duties he shares and _ for the more tangible-minded _ the
pile of diapers changed on his nighttime vigil.
 &HT;    Blair runs none of the risk that many people in temptation-laden
public life do when they posture as defenders of family values and
supporters of marriage. He has a solid and whisper-free 20-year
union with a woman who has a remarkable career of her own and a
proven dedication to balancing an oppressively busy professional
life with real time at home.
 &HT;    On arriving at 10 Downing Street, he established a routine of
working habits designed to guarantee him time for his wife and
children, Euan, now 16, Nicky, 14, and Kathryn, 12. State dinners
were to be substituted by state lunches wherever possible. The
morning hour of 7:30 to 8:30 was inviolate while he took breakfast
with his family upstairs. At the other end of the day, 7:30 marked
his departure from work for family dinner. The red box of working
papers that accompany each British cabinet member home every day
was opened in the Blair household only after the family hour.
 &HT;    ``It seems to me he has a balance between his work and family
which just makes you think, Well, this is actually somebody who's
more like the rest of us and therefore he's more likely to make the
right call,'' says a Downing Street civil servant who is a holdover
from past Conservative governments. ``That's because he's doing it
against a more normal background than, say, a politician who's all
work and no play, like Thatcher coming down to work at 4 in the
morning.''
 &HT;    The Blair kids' friends come over in the afternoon, and the
scene is said by visitors to be the merry chaos you'd expect.
``We're very close as a family, but I think you'd be surprised to
know just how completely normal our family life is,'' Blair says.
``I mean, I do the same things, more or less, as any bloke does
with his kids.''
 &HT;    Weekends are often spent at Chequers, the official country
residence in Buckinghamshire where the Blairs kick a soccer ball
around the grounds in the day and in the evening frequently
entertain, mixing old friends from outside politics with the
occasional cabinet officer and celebrities from the worlds of
entertainment and sports.
 &HT;    The Blairs go about their churchgoing faithfully but privately,
with photographers encouraged to stay away. The Blairs are fiercely
protective of the privacy of their children. They appear as a
family in public only once each year, during their summer holidays
on the continent. Otherwise, the kids are off limits, and Blair
says, ``Having to be fair, in this regard, our press has behaved
pretty well.''
 &HT;    Let that behavior lapse, however, and the Blairs strike back
swiftly. When the tabloid Mail on Sunday planned to print an
utterly benign account of their family life by a former nanny,
Cherie Blair obtained a Saturday night injunction against
publication and then threatened to sue the young woman unless she
promised to honor the confidentiality clause of her employment
contract. They were willing to withstand accusations of gagging the
press and bullying a well-intentioned young woman to make the point
that any public mention, even favorable, of their private life was
out of bounds.
 &HT;    I asked Blair if he felt he had succeeded in immunizing his
children against the effects of growing up at Britain's most
important address. ``So far, touch wood, we've been lucky,'' he
says. ``It's very important because it isn't their fault that their
dad is prime minister. They've got to live the rest of their lives,
and there are two problems here. One is that their friends at
school become too impressed by it and the other is in a sense they
get used to it and not know that I will one day stop being prime
minister. A lot of people may not then be so keen on them and all
the rest of it. We teach them to choose their friends very
carefully, choose friends who are real friends, and just to realize
that this here, it's in some ways a magic moment for them.''
 &HT;    On an afternoon I spent at No. 10 talking to Blair's associates,
Blair went through the grueling prime minister's questions time at
the House of Commons, trading barked insults with the Conservative
leader William Hague, returned to No. 10 for a sensitive meeting
with David Trimble, the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, and
then piled into a car with Cherie to attend a parents' gathering at
Kathryn's school. Anji Hunter, his special assistant and a friend
since they were teen-agers together in Scotland, says Blair has
always been that way.
 &HT;    ``Even as a backbencher, he was never someone who hung around
the tearoom or the bars,'' she says. ``At the end of the day, he
would vote and go home to his family.''
 &HT;    Tony Blair was born May 6, 1953, in Edinburgh and reared in the
northern English city of Durham, where his father was a university
law professor and rising figure in Conservative politics. Cherie
came from a working-class Labor family in Liverpool that fell apart
when she was 7. It was that year, 1961, that her mother was left by
her father, a television actor named Tony Booth, whose bent for
what the British tabloids call ``crumpeteering'' was to produce
five more children, three more marriages and a string of other
relationships. Cherie saw little of her errant father for much of
her youth, but the estrangement ended when he was severely burned
in a 1979 accident and gave up drinking. He and his fourth wife,
Stephanie, are now visitors to No. 10 and Chequers.
 &HT;    When Blair succeeded the wintry John Major as prime minister he
began promoting Britain very effectively as a place with flash. It
wasn't long before models, pop singers and movie stars began
flocking to a land they called Cool Britannia, with the shiny new
prime minister as its master of ceremonies. Charles Falconer,
another old friend and member of the House of Lords who shared
living quarters with Blair when the two were young lawyers in
London, says the image was misleading.
 &HT;    ``He vastly prefers a private life to the social life that comes
with being leader of the opposition or a head of government. His
home has always been London; his family has always been nearby. He
saw lots more of his family than many of his contemporaries did
during the '80s, and now he works in the same building where his
family lives. He's never been on great national campaigns like
yours, and he doesn't have to be away for any length of time from
his family.''
 &HT;    Blair claims his government will always take actions mindful of
their effects on family stability, and one of the five key planks
in the platform for the next electoral campaign is called helping
families. I ask Blair how something as public and unwieldy as
government could be effective in stabilizing something as private
and volatile as a family.
 &HT;    ``I've wrestled with this for 10 years really because I believe
passionately in family life,'' he says. ``It's an important part of
the stability of society. That's common sense and everyone would
agree. But on the other hand, if as politicians you end up kind of
preaching to people about their private lives, you get into trouble
very, very quickly.''
 &HT;    His list of vehicles for government attention include tax
policy, child-care support, schools, truancy, jobs for young
people, flexible working hours, parental leave, sex education and
opportunities for advancement for residents of inner-city
neighborhoods. ``You can't substitute government for parents,'' he
says, ``but you can where it is possible and sensible support
family life.''
 &HT;    Blair is more comfortable talking in family-values generalities
than he is about his own family, but the subject was hard to avoid
in the days following the announcement of Cherie's pregnancy.
Reporters busied themselves doing the math, and they computed that
the whole thing must have started sometime during the Blairs'
vacation travels last summer. When they asked if the child had been
conceived in England, France or Italy, Blair wasn't above noting
wolfishly that any of the three were possible. Later, he said he
thought England was the place. But he added, ``Not that Tuscany
wasn't romantic.''
 &HT;    With 13 highly competitive national newspapers selling a total
of more than 14 million copies a day, Britain subjects its
politicians to intense scrutiny. ``We don't have a great
constituency in the media these days,'' Blair says. ``There is a
tendency for the right to attack us because we are Labor and the
left to attack us because we are New Labor.''
 &HT;    The current general whine in Britain may be nothing more than a
necessary correction on the national tolerance-of-triumphalism
meter. ``Tony Blair has been so successful for sufficiently long,''
says Sion Simon, a political writer sympathetic to him, ``that
there is now a part of every Briton, including most of his closest
friends and allies, that would like to see him humiliated and
broken.''
 &HT;    The man I find in his study at 10 Downing Street appears in no
mood to accommodate them. ``Look, '' Blair says, ``it was
inevitable that this was going to happen. I mean, I used to think
sometimes in that first year, For goodness' sake, let's get back
into normal politics again.''
 &HT;    A lot of the incomings at the official residence are being
launched from the traditional forces in his party who believe that
New Labor ought to be more generous with state aid to the poor and
needy, that Blair is selling out the party's principles. Blair
doesn't duck.
 &HT;    ``If I went back to the old tunes of the left, I would
immediately get a whole lot of support from certain groups of
people,'' he says. ``I mean, it would be daft because it wouldn't
be what the country needed, but people could locate me. You know, I
think one of the problems is that I am totally grounded to what I
believe in, and I have complete confidence in it too. But it isn't
the same grounding as traditional right and left categories, and so
people go around saying I am not grounded.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Blair protests portrayals of him as a man feeling beaten down by
criticisms even as he moves toward the acclamation of almost
certain re-election a year from now. ``I am not dispirited, but you
do have to keep driving the argument forward,'' he says.
 &HT;    ``The fact that our opponents have to coalesce around this
notion of 'Well, they're arrogant' or 'Let's make the country
cynical about them' is because they don't have a big argument. If
they were saying, 'You're destroying the British economy' or 'Look,
you're running the country wrongly, you're taking it in the wrong
direction, and here are the reasons,' but they're not.''
 &HT;    Blair wants to be thought of as more than just a Labor leader
who has overcome the party's reputation for chaotic management or a
prime minister who used his power to become a competent custodian
of the country. He is fond of calling his government ``a project,''
implying not just a rearrangement of British politics but its
permanent restructuring.
 &HT;    ``I would say that we are winning the intellectual argument in
Britain,'' he says. ``I don't see any serious alternative. And I
think if you look around the world, most successful governments are
moving more or less in the same direction. It is that there is a
role for government and for community today, but it is an
empowering role, an equipping role. It's not old, big-style
government imposing top-down, heavy-handed intervention. And it's
making sure that it's not an exclusive but an inclusive type of
political society that you've created.''
 &HT;    The project envisions Blair himself and successors from Labor
running Britain for many years to come. I ask Blair if, three years
after starting it, he can keep the project on the rise even without
the public exuberance that helped send it aloft.
 &HT;    ``All governments in the end never satisfy everybody's
expectations,'' Blair says. ``But you've got to ask yourself: 'Are
we moving the country in the right direction? Are we modernizing
the country in the face of massive change and trying to do it so
that the benefits of change reach all the people? Are we basically
delivering on the things that we came into politics to deliver?' I
would say that I can answer those questions with a fairly
comfortable yes.''

<P>
   It was on this date in 1965 that the FBI delivered to the White
House information about me from ``an extremely sensitive source''
suggesting that it might ``be of interest'' to President Lyndon
Johnson. Even 35 years later, however, my government refuses to
tell me, or historians, what this nugget might have been or whence
it came.
</P>
<P>
   The Rorschach blobs of censorial black on the documents
reproduced here are your taxes at work, obliterating our rights.
The fact of that White House transmittal is the only comprehensible
and legibly dated news I could glean from 41 heavily excised pages
sent to me in alleged compliance with the Freedom of Information
Act.
</P>
<P>
   It was seven years ago that I invoked that act to see my FBI
file, which had long been kept secret. I expected a full dossier
covering my years as a reporter in Moscow, Havana and Washington,
with particularly rich entries for the year 1965, when I annoyed
the authorities with articles about America's covert intervention
in the Dominican Republic and about escalation of the war in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   A part of my file _ apparently the portion that focused on
efforts to track down some of my 1965 sources _ was finally
censored into incoherence and ``declassified'' on Oct. 6, 1998.
Even then, it was not mailed until 18 months later, on March 30,
2000. And the mailing suggested that there were many ``additional
references'' in the files that ``may pertain'' to me. I was told I
could request them, whereupon they would presumably be similarly
blacked out and sent to me in the year 2007.
</P>
<P>
   I offer this amusing but sad evidence of government waste and
corruption because it is emblematic of how federal and most state
and local officials have sabotaged one of the hard-won freedoms
achieved by Americans and their media a generation ago: the right,
with only sensible exceptions, to find out what our government
does, knows and records.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents and county sheriffs alike now routinely frustrate
the law by invoking phony ``security'' concerns to keep their files
secret even decades after any conceivable risk has disappeared.
When that dodge fails, they can refuse information to avoid
``unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,'' even if it is my
privacy that was obviously breached.
</P>
<P>
   And when no pretext can justify withholding information,
governments have learned to play the actuarial odds, stalling
inquiries for months and even years until all interest in, and
value of, their records have expired.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters once thought that they, as surrogates for the public,
would be the main beneficiaries of freedom-of-information laws.
With timely access to hearings and records, they hoped for more
effective monitoring of official behavior and investigations of
chronic injustice. But officialdom has learned to frustrate the
media with refusals that can be challenged with only costly
time-consuming litigation.
</P>
<P>
   It recently took a court hearing and three months for a Columbia
journalism student to gain admission to New York City's
administrative ``taxi court,'' and he had what most reporters lack:
time and legal training.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Police Department routinely deflects inquiries for
four months and dares the media to invest in full-scale litigation.
The New York Times had to go all the way to the Court of Appeals
last year to gain access to the performance records of doctors in
New York hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   As Adam Liptak, The Times' senior counsel, who handles the
paper's freedom-of-information actions, has observed, and as the
surveys of many newspapers around the country have confirmed, most
government agencies know how to work the system to frustrate
unwelcome inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one ``wonderland,'' Liptak reports, where
officials take the law seriously and usually respond positively in
24 hours: the state of Florida. The reason is that Florida law
guarantees an immediate, next-morning judicial review of rejections
and automatic payment of attorney fees if the state loses.
</P>
<P>
   Bureaucrats wanting to withhold a piece of information must seek
specific legislation, says Pat Gleason, general counsel to
Florida's attorney general. And as Congress and other states might
note, Florida has sunnily survived its nakedness.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, even the crudest censorship sometimes slips and
fails to conceal damaging evidence of official stupidity. Thus it
was that I learned from one clear line in a memo that the FBI had
to consult the Congressional Directory to discover that I worked
for The New York Times and that censored ``indices'' showed that I
often wrote about European affairs!
</P>
<P>
   And that ``sensitive'' letter to the White House concluded with
an oddly self-effacing explanation that ``all correspondents of The
New York Times are treated with circumspection by the bureau and
our relationship with The New York Times is strained.''
</P>
<P>
   Heads should roll for clearing that confession of respect.
</P>

page editor and executive editor of The New York Times. He won a

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Two years ago, Elie Samaha phoned John Travolta and told him he
was going to make his dream come true. Travolta had never heard of
him. ``I didn't know who Elie Samaha was,'' he recalls. ``And
neither did my manager.''
 &HT;    Samaha, who owns Franchise Pictures, a company that finances and
produces more than a dozen movies a year, wanted to meet with
Travolta to discuss ``Battlefield Earth,'' a script based on L. Ron
Hubbard's science-fiction novel. For more than 15 years, Travolta
had been trying to get this movie, his pet project, off the ground.
 &HT;    ``Battlefield Earth'' had bounced around three studios but had
been shelved again and again. So many years had passed that
Travolta switched from longing to play the youthful hero of the
movie to setting his sights on the nine-foot villain with the
cackling laugh _ and, yet, even after a string of $100 million
box-office hits to his credit, Travolta could not get Hollywood to
budge on ``Battlefield.''
 &HT;    ``I have a special affection for this book,'' says Travolta, who
is a follower of Scientology, the religion that Hubbard originated
when he was not turning out pulp fiction. ``Hubbard was a great
writer, and I had an idea of the movie's potential, a fantasy in my
mind that lasted for years.'' When Samaha called, Travolta agreed
to meet him for dinner at the Bel-Air Hotel.
 &HT;    Samaha was looking to up his game from the $5 million movies he
had been making at Franchise. He had read the script for
``Battlefield Earth'' and also saw potential: a big, controversial
movie with a big profile in the industry; a big star, who is also a
big star overseas; and a script that was ready to shoot. There was
only one sticking point. ``I said, 'If John wants to make this
movie, what does he want to get paid?''' Samaha recalls. ``Because
I do not pay anybody what they make. That is not my business
plan.''
 &HT;    If ``Battlefield Earth'' had not been Travolta's dream, he would
have demanded his usual $20 million. But dreams lead to compromise
in Hollywood, and Samaha knows that. It is a key part of his
business plan: scavenge and dig and find the script or project that
a star most wants to make; finance it overseas; then shoot it in
Canada to save money.
 &HT;    Travolta's pet project arrived in theaters on May 12. The actor
took a pay cut _ even investing $5 million of his own money when
the production fell short _ but he is thrilled with how things
turned out. ``Elie is primarily a financier,'' Travolta says. ``But
he understands vision.''
 &HT;    It is 10 minutes into the first quarter of the Lakers game, and
Samaha will not sit down. Franchise Pictures has six courtside
seats on the floor of the Staples Center, and on this April evening
Samaha has invited Sylvester Stallone, a producer named Mark Canton
and John Ptak, a top senior agent at Creative Artists Agency who
specializes in foreign financing, to join him at the game.
 &HT;    Samaha, who at 43 looks like a taller, lankier Stallone, is
dressed in black pants, black shirt, black tie and brown suede
shoes, and he runs from seat to seat, attending to his guests. He
gets them food, drinks, programs, tickets to the VIP bar, to the
skybox. In exchange, Samaha gets them. With the exception of
Stallone, who is a longtime friend, none of Samaha's other guests
would have recognized him five years ago.
 &HT;    Then, he was known, if he was known at all, as the slightly
shadowy guy who could get you into Roxbury, a club he owned on the
Sunset Strip that became notorious when the actress Shannen Doherty
got involved in a brawl there.
 &HT;    But the business in Hollywood has shifted. These days, Samaha's
skill at attracting foreign financing for movies with big stars has
become highly attractive to the increasingly risk-averse studios.
Whereas he used to seem vaguely sleazy, studios are now impressed
by the scale of Samaha's ambition, by his knack for fostering
favorite-orphan projects like ``Battlefield Earth'' and producing
them at a price.
 &HT;    So far, Franchise has undertaken, among others, ``The Big
Kahuna'' (for Kevin Spacey), ``The Pledge'' (for Jack Nicholson and
Sean Penn), ``Get Carter'' (for Stallone) and, most successfully,
``The Whole Nine Yards'' (for Bruce Willis). When everyone else
said no or maybe or we'll see, Samaha said yes. He served the
stars.
 &HT;    Like a latter-day Sam Goldwyn or Harry Warner, Samaha, who is
Lebanese and learned English from watching Clint Eastwood films,
views the movie business as the perfect job for an immigrant with
drive: there are no class restrictions; there is no need for a
formal education.
 &HT;    ``In Hollywood, you only need success to have more success,''
Samaha explains, fussing over Stallone. ``People laughed at me. I
didn't care. They didn't take me seriously. They didn't even return
my calls three years ago.'' He pauses, briefly considering
Shaquille O'Neal, who is passing the ball to Kobe Bryant. ``But I'm
in the business to make money, and why would I hold a grudge? I
mean, who the hell was Elie Samaha three years ago?''
 &HT;    Part of Samaha's credibility with the Hollywood community comes
from the box-office success of ``The Whole Nine Yards.'' Samaha
produced the project when Warner Brothers was not interested. It
was stuck in their library: studios commission and develop hundreds
of scripts a year and only a handful get made; the rest languish in
a movie purgatory known as ``turnaround.'' Samaha loves turnaround
_ he can buy scripts stuck there for almost nothing, and often the
scripts have been polished and tweaked (for better or for ill) at
someone else's expense.
 &HT;    ``The Whole Nine Yards'' was personally important to Bruce
Willis because it had been developed by his brother, David. To help
keep costs low, Willis and the other principals deferred their
usual salaries in lieu of a percentage of the final gross. So far,
the movie has made $60 million domestically.
 &HT;    Warner Brothers was amazed. Surprise success is a magic wand in
Hollywood. It can smooth out rough edges and inspire faith. ``The
Whole Nine Yards'' was just fluky enough to make people wonder if
Samaha knew something they didn't. This is not to say that Samaha
has arrived, exactly.
 &HT;    ``Elie's first real test will be 'Battlefield Earth,''' John
Ptak says. ``Elie listens and he's charming. But that stuff's all
Act 1. This is a three-act business. Act 1 is style and personality
and relationships. Act 2 is creating the avenues and highways to
put the cars on. And Act 3 is creating the actual cars, which are
the movies. You need all three acts to be successful. 'The Whole
Nine Yards' proved something. We'll see if 'Battlefield Earth' can
continue on that road.''
 &HT;    Samaha never had the same anxieties about ``Battlefield Earth''
that plagued the rest of Hollywood. Among executives, there was a
free-floating worry that ``Battlefield Earth'' would have the taint
of what many consider to be a cultlike religion. In fact, Hubbard
wrote fiction before he created Scientology, and ``Battlefield
Earth'' is a straightforward aliens-vs-humans kind of epic. The
book is not an allegory _ the script lacks even the mythological
overtones of ``Star Wars'' _ and is dismissed by hard-core
science-fiction writers.
 &HT;    ``Most people who know anything about science fiction think of
Hubbard as a complete fraud,'' says the novelist John Kessel.
``Hubbard writes a kind of science fiction that we call 'thud and
blunder,' stories for crackpots and juveniles.'' The movie will not
financially benefit Scientology, either. The rights to the book
were acquired in the mid-1990s from Author Services Inc., a Los
Angeles agency that handles Hubbard's fiction and is not affiliated
with the church. Yet however tenuous the Scientology connection,
Hollywood remained wary.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Travolta claims that no one ever mentioned Scientology to him.
``No executive ever brought it up,'' he maintains. ``I don't think
it would have been appropriate protocol.'' Yet there is no question
that Travolta's passion for the project stems from his belief in
Scientology. He is not a science-fiction fan (``I guess I liked
'Stranger in a Strange Land,''' is all he can muster), and this
movie has always been his homage to Hubbard.
 &HT;    During the '90s, ``Battlefield Earth'' was shuffled from one
studio to another, from MGM to Fox 2000 to Warner Brothers. The
project looked permanently stalled. But a few years ago, Travolta
saw a window on his calendar and told his manager, Jonathan Krane,
that he wanted to make his movie. Samaha was told of Travolta's
desire by Cassian Elwes, an agent at William Morris. Samaha had
badgered Elwes for access to his big projects, projects that the
studios had rejected. He saw a great opportunity to prove
something.
 &HT;    Samaha promptly secured a fluctuating credit line of up to $200
million from Imperial Bank in Los Angeles. With Travolta accepting
a pay cut, and after other concessions, like shooting in Canada,
the film's $90 million budget was slashed to $65 million. Over the
next six months, Samaha raised 70 percent of the budget for
``Battlefield Earth'' by selling off overseas rights to the film.
The international market for stars like Travolta, Willis and
Stallone is consistent and huge. Increasingly, this is how movies _
especially expensive action movies with big stars _ are financed.
 &HT;    Despite the qualms about the relationship between ``Battlefield
Earth'' and Scientology, Samaha managed to secure major financial
backing from Intertainment AG, a publicly held company in Germany,
where hostility to the religion is widespread. Samaha recalls: ``I
would yell at everyone, 'This is a science-fiction film starring
John Travolta!' again and again.'' As for Warner Brothers, which is
now distributing the movie for Franchise, its gamble is minimal _
Samaha has done all the major financing for them.
 &HT;    In fact, ``Battlefield Earth'' represents the consummation of
three distinct agendas: Samaha gains credibility by pulling off a
financing feat with a major star; Warner Brothers gets a big summer
movie with little financial investment; and Travolta gets to
realize his dream. No one, except Travolta and Krane, seems to care
whether or not the film has any artistic merit. As Samaha sees it,
creativity is up to the filmmakers.
 &HT;    Franchise's walls are lined with posters for movies that few
people have heard of: ``The White River Kid,'' ``Free Money,''
``Confession.'' These films are the foundation of the company.
Franchise has made dozens of low-budget movies. Some feature stars
_ Marlon Brando is in ``Free Money'' and phoned Samaha personally
to request Franchise's financial help. (At first, Samaha thought
the call was a prank.) The movie, like many in Franchise's library,
was never released in theaters, having gone straight to cable and
video. There is a lot of money in that secondary business _ you
shoot the film for five million and sell it for six _ but no
prestige.
 &HT;    There is a greater potential for financial failure with movies
like ``Battlefield Earth'' or ``Get Carter,'' but Samaha was not
happy staying on the fringes, however safe, of Hollywood. ``I
wanted to make bigger movies. I wanted to make movies with major
movie stars. There are only 30 stars in the world. If I have a
Stallone movie, I know I can do $42 million internationally. If
it's Meg Ryan, I can do $35. If it's Julia Roberts, I can do $45.
And besides, actors are like good wine. You put them on the shelf
and they're worth more. A movie with a star in it is good for my
library. A library is worth money. It's very easy. It's my
business.''
 &HT;    Samaha moved to Los Angeles 18 years ago. Born in Beirut, he was
4 when his father died; Elie and his brother and sister were reared
by their mother. He was athletic and joined the Lebanese Christian
Army when he was 14. Instead of attending high school, Samaha flew
off to London and Paris, where he managed the career of a
girlfriend who was a model. ``We don't like to talk about her,''
Samaha demurs. ``She is now dating one of the most powerful men in
the United States.''
 &HT;    After working for a year in New York as a bouncer at Studio 54,
Samaha migrated to Los Angeles in 1982. He read an article that
listed ``the five most successful businesses to be in'' and settled
on dry cleaning. ``I called my cleaner Celebrity Cleaners,'' Samaha
says.
 &HT;    In four years, Samaha and his brother, who remains his partner,
had 38 dry cleaners. They sold all except four businesses but kept
the real estate. He now owns property all over Los Angeles,
especially on Sunset Boulevard.
 &HT;    ``I made my first film, 'The Immortals,' in 1995 for $1.8
million,'' Samaha recalls. ``It was about the yakuza. I sold it to
October Films, to HBO and overseas. I made so much money on it, and
I thought, This is a great business.''
 &HT;    Samaha's first partners in the movie business were Amir Malin
and Avi Lerner at Millennium Films. They wanted to stay low end and
low budget. (Malin eventually left and was a founder of Artisan
Entertainment, which had enormous success with ``The Blair Witch
Project.'') Samaha wanted Millennium to shift gears from cheap
movies with B-list stars to large movies with top stars. His
partners disagreed.
 &HT;    ``They said, 'Quality doesn't pay.' I thought, Life's too short.
And I went on my own. They were laughing at me, of course.'' By
wooing agents and studio executives and talent like Stallone and
Willis, Samaha began forging powerful alliances. He sought out
projects _ like ``The Big Kahuna'' with Kevin Spacey and ``3,000
Miles to Graceland,'' a heist movie set in Las Vegas that Kevin
Costner wanted to make _ that had been languishing in one way or
another.
 &HT;    The stars Samaha has signed up impress everybody, from the
studios to Imperial Bank, which, with a consortium of other banks,
has upped Franchise's line of credit to $300 million. ``As long as
Samaha maintains his relationships with talent,'' says Jared
Underwood of Imperial Bank, ``we believe he can deliver.''
 &HT;    But what happens when one of his movies fails at the box office?
If ``Battlefield Earth'' is not a smash overseas, foreign investors
could blanch when asked to invest in future Franchise projects.
Similarly, Samaha's enthusiasm for the pet projects of big stars
may not prove to be all that wise in the long run.
 &HT;    Samaha does not seem worried, though. ``My projected numbers on
'Battlefield Earth' are really conservative,'' Samaha says. ``I'm
already covered internationally, and there's no way I'm going to
lose if the movie does $35 million domestically. And Travolta has
never had an action movie do under $35 million.''
 &HT;    Isn't he secretly hoping for a blockbuster? ``You can't be a
jerk in this business,'' Samaha says. ``I'm looking to do a $15
million weekend on 'Battlefield Earth.' Fifteen is huge for me. My
expectations are reasonable. And besides'' _ he smiles slightly _
``this is just so fun. If I was a betting man, and I am, I would
bet that this movie is going to change Franchise Pictures. On
'Battlefield Earth,' I can't lose.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   In an era when practically everyone in Hollywood seems to be the
child of a former star, a special distinction belongs to Douglas
Fairbanks Jr., the suave, sophisticated actor who was the first
second-generation movie star.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a lifetime of accomplishments onscreen and off,
Fairbanks never quite shook the ``Jr.'' from his name, always
remaining slightly in his father's shadow. But when he died
XXXDATEXXX from XXXCAUSEXXX, the entertainment world lost one of
its most popular and long-lived fixtures.
</P>
<P>
   Though there was a marked resemblance between the two, Fairbanks
never had the flamboyant exuberance which distinguished his
father's best films. Instead, he was debonair and casually
seductive, as likable onscreen as he was off, where he was one of
Hollywood's most famous raconteurs. He could carry off a
swashbuckling role in his father's style _ his most enduring film
was perhaps ``The Prisoner of Zenda'' (1937) _ but was equally
comfortable in screwball farces, romantic comedies or brawling
dramas.
</P>
<P>
   Though many later believed him to be the son of Hollywood's
first superstar couple, Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford,
Fairbanks Jr.'s mother was actually the actor's first wife, Anna
Beth Fairbanks. Born in New York on Dec. 9, 1909, he was initially
a chubby child who bore little apparent resemblance to his dashing
father, from whom he was estranged for much of his life.
</P>
<P>
   In his teen years, however, he sprouted rapidly, growing into a
lanky, muscular body and clean-cut, chiseled good looks which
tagged him as a potential star. Making his screen debut at age 14
as the star of ``Stephen Steps Out'' (1923), he quickly grew into a
silent-film regular. In such films as ``Stella Dallas'' (1925),
``Broken Hearts of Hollywood'' (1926) and ``A Woman of Affairs''
(1928), he generally played reckless prodigal sons or shiftless
lovers _ usually seeing the error of his ways by the final reel.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly effective performance as a pushy reporter in
``The Power of the Press'' (1928), directed by the young Frank
Capra, earned Fairbanks the chance to star opposite Joan Crawford
in ``Our Modern Maidens'' (1929). Shortly afterward, the two stars
married in real life.
</P>
<P>
   The coming of sound posed no obstacle to Fairbanks, whose voice
was light but resonant, and he was soon appearing in Warner Bros.
talkies, including such classics as ``The Dawn Patrol'' (1930),
``Little Caesar'' (1930) and ``Union Depot'' (1932).
</P>
<P>
   Warner's trademark tough-guy action roles weren't the best fit
with Fairbanks' dapper presence, however, and he left the studio in
1934. He spent several years making British films _ including the
historical epic ``Catherine the Great'' (1934) _ before he returned
to Hollywood for ``The Prisoner of Zenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing opposite the even-more-dapper Ronald Colman, Fairbanks
suddenly clicked as Rupert of Hentzau, a rakish, amoral but
charming swordsman with a quip ever on his lips. Cheerfully
betraying everyone in sight _ and making good his escape at the
film's end _ Fairbanks' murderous Rupert was almost the evil twin
of Douglas Fairbanks Sr.'s rakish-but-heroic Zorro.
</P>
<P>
   Energized by his success in the role, Fairbanks spent the next
few years mingling romantic comedies such as ``The Joy of Living''
(1938, opposite Irene Dunne) and ``Having Wonderful Time'' (1938,
opposite Ginger Rogers) with adventure movies such as ``Gunga Din''
(1939, as a reckless British sergeant) and ``The Sun Never Sets''
(1939, with Basil Rathbone as his brother). In 1941 he returned to
the swashbuckling genre for ``The Corsican Brothers,'' this time
playing twins.
</P>
<P>
   A staunch Anglophile, Fairbanks was an early advocate of
American involvement in World War II, serving as national vice
chairman of the Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies in
1940 and 1941. After Pearl Harbor, Fairbanks joined the Navy,
serving as a lieutenant commander until the end of the war and
earning several decorations. He would remain active in diplomatic
and military activities into the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to Hollywood after the war, Fairbanks renewed his
swashbuckling credentials with ``Sinbad the Sailor'' (1947), a
lavish, special-effects-studded epic in which his performance was
seen by some as a salute to his father, who had died in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly interested in off-camera work, the actor produced
and co-wrote his next two swashbucklers, ``The Exile'' (1948) and
``The Fighting O'Flynn'' (1949). He then returned to England to
make ``State Secret'' (1950).
</P>
<P>
   Fairbanks moved to England in the early 1950s, and his film
output diminished. He experimented in television, hosting,
producing and often acting in an anthology series, ``Douglas
Fairbanks Presents.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he was largely absent from the movies thereafter _ his
final film was ``Ghost Story'' (1981), which teamed him with fellow
silver-screen veterans Fred Astaire, Melvyn Douglas and John
Houseman _ Fairbanks remained active in other fields. He appeared
in various stage plays, including playing Henry Higgins in a
British production of ``My Fair Lady,'' and lent his warmth and
sophisticated presence to orchestra narrations and
television-series hosting duties, including the American
presentations of ``The Compleat Gilbert &AMP; Sullivan'' in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In later years, the actor also served on several corporate
boards, worked for various charitable organizations and, with his
seemingly bottomless supply of jokes and stories, was a welcome
figure in society on both sides of the Atlantic. He published three
autobiographical books, including ``The Fairbanks Album'' (1975),
``Salad Days'' (1988) and ``A Hell of a War'' (1993).
</P>
<P>
   He was married three times, most recently to Vera Shelton in
1991, three years after the death of Mary Lee Fairbanks, his wife
of 49 years. He leaves three daughters _ Daphne Fairbanks-Weston,
Victoria Van Gerbig and Melissa Morant.
</P>
<P>
   Fairbanks never achieved the superstardom of his father, but he
lived a long and rewarding life, succeeding at nearly everything he
tried his hand in. If, as critics said, his best performances all
gave the sense that he was having a lot of fun, it was probably
because he was. &QL;

<P>
   Most of Douglas Fairbanks Jr.'s best films can be found on video
cassette, and a few on laser disk or DVD. A greatest-hits sampling
might include the following six films:
</P>
<P>
   + `THE PRISONER OF ZENDA' (1937).
</P>
<P>
   Fairbanks' defining role, as Rupert of Hentzau, a
roguish-but-dashing swordsman maneuvering between villainous
Raymond Massey and heroic Ronald Colman, who plays the king of
Ruritania and his look-alike cousin. The performance works
precisely because Fairbanks never shows the slightest trace of
conscience. Watch the dialogue scenes between him and Colman, which
feature fencing as skillful as any of the sword fights.
</P>
<P>
   + `THE JOY OF LIVING' (1938).
</P>
<P>
   This neglected gem features Irene Dunne as a harried Broadway
star beset by fans, agents and a rapacious family, with Fairbanks
as the devil-may-care shipowner who captivates her in spite of
himself. As the parasitic family, Guy Kibbee, Alice Brady and a
young, surly Lucille Ball are hysterical.
</P>
<P>
   + `GUNGA DIN' (1940).
</P>
<P>
   One of the great action movies of all time, with director George
Stevens pitting Cary Grant, Fairbanks and Victor McLaglen against
vicious Indian cultists and their own propensity for getting into
trouble. A rousing epic, then and now, and only distantly related
to the Rudyard Kipling poem.
</P>
<P>
   + `THE CORSICAN BROTHERS' (1941).
</P>
<P>
   Double for your money, with Fairbanks as long-lost twin
brothers, psychically linked and caught up in bewildering
intrigues. The special effects that bring Fairbanks face to face
with himself are still first-rate.
</P>
<P>
   + `SINBAD THE SAILOR' (1947).
</P>
<P>
   A deliriously colorful Arabian Nights story, with Fairbanks as
the title character. A strong supporting cast includes Anthony
Quinn and Maureen O'Hara. Fairbanks borrows some of the flamboyant
mannerisms of his swashbuckling father's ``Thief of Baghdad'' in
this more-than-a-little-tongue-in-cheek epic.
</P>
<P>
   + `STATE SECRET' (1950).
</P>
<P>
   Many of Fairbanks' best films involved doubles, and so does this
meticulously plotted, surprisingly witty British thriller.
Fairbanks plays an American doctor who, visiting a small Middle
European country, discovers that its ruler has been assassinated
and replaced with a ringer. Itself a sort of ``Prisoner of Zenda''
evil twin, this is one of the actor's best and most intelligent
films.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Usually red wine is the star of studies and press releases.
</P>
<P>
   We're constantly bombarded with news stories about the effects
of red wine. A glass of red wine every day helps prevent heart
disease. Red wine in moderation is good for the blood. Too much red
wine will give you a headache. Red wine spilled on a white sofa can
end a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently it never matters if the red wine is a merlot or a
cabernet or something of a Mad Dog 20/20 vintage. Just has to be
red.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, though, beer is getting a lot of play from media-hungry
researchers who apparently would rather concentrate on this sort of
material than, I don't know, A CURE FOR CANCER or something.
</P>
<P>
   I collect this stuff because I can. Consider these actual
beer-related findings, theories and studies from the last couple of
months:
</P>
<P>
   _ A Dutch researcher said that consuming a reasonable amount of
beer every day could be even better for your heart than the
proverbial glass or two of red wine.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some nimrods from the animals-rights activist group PETA
touted beer as a nutritionally preferable alternative to milk with
a campaign featuring the slogan, ``Got Beer?''
</P>
<P>
   _ Harvard Medical School found that in terms of raising one's
HDL, or ``good'' cholesterol, consuming moderate amounts of beer is
the same as consuming moderate amounts of wine or liquor.
</P>
<P>
   _ A study commissioned by Guinness found that mustachioed
consumers of the creamy-topped stout lose more than 160,000 pints a
year due to ``upper-lip absorption,'' gross. That figure would be
even higher if David Crosby and that Fluff dude who used to caddy
for Tiger Woods became regular Guinness drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Another study theorized that when you've had five beers in one
sitting, you've officially reached a binge. So just have four and a
half and go home with a smile!
</P>
<P>
   _ New York University researchers found that higher beer prices
often reduce beer drinking _ and cigarette smoking. Um, sure, if a
six-pack is pricier, fewer purchases can be made and it leaves less
spare change for smokes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Meanwhile, the Public Health Institute in Berkeley, Calif.,
was finding that 10 percent of beer drinkers consume 43 percent of
beer. This means that people who drink a lot of beer drink a lot of
beer.
</P>
<P>
   I don't have a white lab coat or a research grant, but I have
done some field research of my own in this area, starting with my
first illegal beer (can of Hamm's Draft in a silver can designed to
resemble a miniature keg) and my first legal brew (Old Style in a
mason jar, from a tap at Nick's Sports Page in Dolton), both
quaffed many years ago.
</P>
<P>
   I've observed that consuming too many beers leads to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Excess midriff syndrome, aka ``a beer gut.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Long lines in the bathrooms at Comiskey Park and Soldier
Field, where guys tell the same jokes year after year while
belching loudly and randomly screaming things like ``Cubs Suck!''
and ``Da Bears!'' and the ever-popular, ``The water's cold!''
</P>
<P>
   _ A temporary cerebral condition known as ``stupidity.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most ridiculous and pointless beer study yet arrived
courtesy of the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta. They got
tremendous play in the media with their findings on teen-agers,
gonorrhea and cheap beer.
</P>
<P>
   As the Los Angeles Times put it, ``When the price of beer goes
up, teen-age gonorrhea goes down, federal health officials say.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite. What the CDC said was this: A tax increase of
20 cents per six-pack could reduce gonorrhea rates among teen-agers
but 9 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   And even that was a shaky extrapolation of the actual four-page
study.
</P>
<P>
   The basic finding of the study was that when teens drink,
they're more likely to have sex without a condom, with multiple
partners and with high-risk partners.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it could be argued that the causal relationship is
the other way around _ that teens who have more sex are more likely
to drink beer.
</P>
<P>
   The study looked at gonorrhea rates among the young and beer-tax
increases from 1981 to 1995 and came up with the conclusion that
more expensive beer leads to a lower rate of this particular STD.
</P>
<P>
   But if you look at the study itself and not just the news
stories that parroted the findings, you'll see that even the CDC
admits the study does NOT prove an actual connection between the
price of beer and the rate of gonorrhea.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the point?
</P>
<P>
   To get media attention, of course. To see your findings appear
in hundreds of newspapers and on local newscasts across the
country. And to use those clippings the next time you have to prove
your worth as a researcher.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, I'll continue with my field research. This just
in:
</P>
<P>
   Beer makes you belch. Video at 5, 6 and 10.

PRESSURE-TREATED POSTS WON'T HARM DOGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have to replace a long stockade fence to keep the dogs in
the yard. I would like to use cedar posts; the rest of the fence
can be any kind of wood, but my son says the posts must be pressure
treated. I am concerned that the dogs will rub up against the posts
and be poisoned by the copper arsenate in the pressure-treated
posts. Why can't I use cedar posts?
</P>
<P>
   C.D., Hanover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Why not indeed. Yes, you can use cedar posts, which will last
about 15 years, when set in the ground, possibly longer if there is
good drainage under each post. However, there is no good reason
against using pressure-treated posts. The copper arsenate will not
rub off on the dogs. Such posts will outlast the fence. And to
avoid the controversy, consider installing an electric fence, an
invisible boundary that will keep the dogs in and other critters
out.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am redoing my asphalt driveway with a rumble strip and
cobblestone borders. I was quoted prices for mortaring in the
stones, and for not mortaring them. Should the stones be mortared
or not?
</P>
<P>
   PAULA DAULL, Salem, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. First of all, what the driveway man calls cobblestones are
really paving stones, granite pieces cut into squares and
rectangles. Cobblestones are natural, uncut stones, very round, and
if they are put in a driveway you don't need a rumble strip. Being
so uneven, they are rumble strips all by themselves, and,
incidentally, difficult to walk on.
</P>
<P>
   That done with, the paving stones do not have to be mortared; in
fact, they should not be mortared unless they are set on concrete.
Paving stones, like bricks and patio blocks, are best set in sand
or stone dust. And, dry-set stones should be less expensive than
mortared stones.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I live on a hill, and my neighbor's house is higher than
mine. The downspouts on his house are very long with extensions
that empty out about a foot from my property. The water flows down
my land and erodes it. How can I stop that flow and erosion? No
one, including the neighbor, seems to have a solution.
</P>
<P>
   J.S.T.P., Belmont, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If you can get your neighbor to move the downspouts so they
discharge parallel to his house and harmlessly away, fine and good.
Or, he could build dry wells (holes in the ground) to accommodate
the water, if there is enough property to allow those wells to be
10 feet from the house.
</P>
<P>
   If these ideas cannot be taken to heart, then I suggest you dig
a dry well on the property line, or near it on your land, allowing
the discharge to go into the well instead of down your property. If
you cover the dry well with a wooden lid and cover that with turf,
no one will be the wiser, and you will win the good neighbor award.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I bought a house with no railings on either side of an open
stairway of 10 steps. I had new oak railings installed. It involved
taking out a wrought-iron rail on one side and installing railings
on each side, with 37 balusters and three posts of oak. There are
16 feet of railing altogether. The cost was $4,000. Is that high?
</P>
<P>
   J., Westwood, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I think it is; materials might cost $500 to $700, leaving
$3,500 to $3,300 for installation. A price of $2,000 would have
been quite reasonable, even $3,000 is acceptable, but $4,000 is
exorbitant, in my oppinion. A dealer in the staircase industry,
with whom I checked, concurred.
</P>
<P>
   This would have been a good time to call for bids. Also, if the
purchase of the house was recent, you could have insisted that the
seller fix the unsafe condition of the stairway.

IF THINGS HAD CHANGED, A NEW CAMRY WOULD BE ON ORDER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GRIFFITH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The three-year itch arrived right on schedule, about 34 monthly
payments into the four-year coupon book on my 1997 Camry.
</P>
<P>
   The itch comes for no real reason outside of boredom.
</P>
<P>
   There is no sensible explanation for trading in the '97,
especially with only 30,000 miles on the odometer. It still looks
new and is practically indistinguishable from its successors unless
you're an expert on the nuances of Toyota's minor changes for 1998,
1999, and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   It never has had a major repair, just scheduled maintenance.
That means not so much as a flat tire or trip to the body shop.
Biggest fix-its: a new set of wiper blades and regulation gas cap
to replace the oversized wrong one we inherited from a
``full-serve'' fuel stop, and replacing a broken plastic clip that
holds the hood support rod.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, the '97 is worth at least twice what I owe on it.
</P>
<P>
   So why sell it?
</P>
<P>
   As best as I can figure, I've gotten so used to a lifetime of
used cars that three years was about the maximum length of my usual
relationship with a vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   But it's going to be hard to part with this car. You know the
saying, ``Be careful what you wish for, because you might get it?''
That's one I'm wary of. But this was one time I went out to buy
something and discovered that I got everything I was hoping for . .
. and maybe a little more.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what I wanted:
</P>
<P>
   _ A four-door sedan so another couple could comfortably join us
for an evening out or a daytrip.
</P>
<P>
   _ Something totally reliable.
</P>
<P>
   _ A car that cost less than $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ A V-6 (or turbocharged 4-cylinder) with 5-speed manual
transmission.
</P>
<P>
   This Camry has met and continues to meet all four requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when the itch is there, you have to scratch it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of salve, my pals from the New England Motor Press
Association conspired to send temptation my way _ a session with a
2000 Camry V-6 LE, followed by another with a 2000 Camry Solara,
the two-door coupe version of the Camry.
</P>
<P>
   The major differences between new and old, to me, were that the
new vehicles had an automatic transmission and were equipped with
sunroofs.
</P>
<P>
   And each was new. And tempting. Driving the 2000 Camry was like
sitting in a newer version of my car.
</P>
<P>
   A walk around the two Camrys parked side-by-side revealed only
the most minor of changes. The 2000 has a chrome trim ring round
the grille opening. The taillights, straight bars on my '97, now
dip down toward the center of the car. The hood is held up by
hydraulic cylinders instead of the prop rod on my 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' says Toytota's Wade Hoyt. ``If it ain't broke, you make
the taillights bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't appear to have been kidding. The changes are that
minor.
</P>
<P>
   The driving experience is remarkably similar, too. Even though I
still prefer my manual transmission, the automatics on both 2000
models were quick and smooth and always seemed to be in the right
gear. On-ramp and merging acceleration was fine on both and each
behaved well on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   The dashboard displays haven't changed nor have the deep
cupholders in the center armrest with a couple of flimseys that pop
out for the rear-seat passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Handling was similar in all three cars. The surprise is that the
suspension and tires in my '97 still do a comparable job to the new
versions. I was thinking maybe things had softened up over time.
All three, being V-6s, have disc brakes and ABS. The Camry ABS in
my '97 has kicked in many times, and I now regard it as an old
friend coming along for a ride on wet and icy roads. The Solara
suspension was slightly tighter _ just enough to be noticeable. It
is, however, far short of being a true ports coupe. For that, you'd
have to go elsewhere in the Toyota family and try the Celica or the
coming MR2 Spyder roadster.
</P>
<P>
   The sound system in the 2000s, meanwhile, has a great optional
improvement over the AM/FM/Stereo/Cassette in my '97. Try a 6-CD,
in-dash unit. You feed the CDs in one at a time like quarters into
a parking meter. Having seen CD magazines squirreled away under
seats, in center consoles, in the glove compartment and in the
trunk, this was a slick system. Oh yes, the speakers were much
improved, too.
</P>
<P>
   An all-day Saturday outing to see our local team lose in the
championship game of the State Girls Basketball Championship game
proved the Solara is a perfectly acceptable car for four adults.
Our companions had no trouble hopping in and out of the back seat.
I tried it myself and agreed with their assessment that legroom was
fine even with the front seats all the way back.
</P>
<P>
   Reading the manuals for each of the 2000s revealed that Toyota
recommends premium fuel for optimum performance. Funny, I thought,
didn't the dealer tell me mine would run fine on regular? I know he
did, and I've been running it that way for three years with not so
much as a knock. It also regularly delivers 25-28 miles per gallon.
Still, a review of my manual reveals that Toyota recommends that I
should be running the '97 on premium, too. Now that it's drinking
the more expensive blend, I suspect performance might have crept up
a notch, but, then again, it might only be my imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Now about that itch.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the payment book is down to 10, I'm pretty sure I'm
going to keep my '97.
</P>
<P>
   About a month ago, a colleague tossed a brochure in my mailbox
that said TRD (Toyota Racing Development) would be coming out with
a supercharger this summer and that it would fit my V-6. I'm
thinking about it.
</P>
<P>
   I'm also thinking of tightening up the suspension with some
Solara struts if they fit. And a sunroof would be a nice addition.
</P>
<P>
   All it takes is scratch, scratch, scratch . . . .
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe a can of that air freshener named ``new-car smell''
might be all that's needed.

&HT;     HIGH ART DEAL GOES AWRY ON THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ZACHARY COILE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A Sacramento, Calif., lawyer was suspended from
trading on the auction house eBay after allegedly using an online
alias to drive up bids for a painting he was selling _ a piece some
believe could be a lost masterpiece by late artist Richard
Diebenkorn.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-day suspension by San Jose, Calif.-based eBay came as
questions mounted over the seller's credibility and whether the
orange and green abstract landscape is an original or a fake.
</P>
<P>
   But the suspension could wind up benefiting the seller,
32-year-old Ken Walton. The penalty cancels all his proposed sales
on eBay's site, including the deal Monday night to sell the
painting to a Dutch art collector for $135,805.
</P>
<P>
   If the piece is found to be a Diebenkorn, Walton could put it up
for bid again. Significant pieces by the painter have sold recently
at auction for $1 million and up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything is possible,'' Walton said Wednesday. ``Maybe (the
buyer) wants to back out. Who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   Walton, who offered the piece for sale under the user-name
``golfpoorly,'' was suspended by eBay for making a $4,500 bid on
the painting using a separate user-name, ``grecescu.''
</P>
<P>
   The practice is known to company officials as ``shilling,'' when
the seller artificially bids up the auction price to reap a bigger
profit from the final sale.
</P>
<P>
   Walton denied the violation of eBay rules was an effort to make
more money on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I placed this bid for an acquaintance of mine who, after
noticing the frenzy surrounding the auction, expressed an interest
in taking part in the action, but did not have an eBay account or
an active e-mail address,'' he said in a statement faxed to the
media. ``I placed a bid for him with one of my eBay accounts, not
realizing that this was against eBay policy.''
</P>
<P>
   He then praised the company for taking action against him,
saying, ``I applaud their efforts to maintain eBay as a safe
trading community.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the bid history, listed on eBay, the $4,500 bid
wasn't the major cause of the painting's inflated price. The
preceding bid came in at $4,201. The next bid was $4,811.
</P>
<P>
   But an eBay spokesman said any effort to inflate the price, even
by a small amount, is a major violation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shilling is one of the biggest concerns that our users have
because it gets to the very integrity of the bidding process,''
eBay spokesman Kevin Pursglove said. ``When we hear about it, we
move very fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Pursglove said eBay policy called for Walton to be suspended
from using the service for 30 days. A repeat offense could result
in a lifetime ban.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty comes after Walton was being criticized by
journalists and art collectors after he admitted Tuesday that he
had lied about aspects of the painting.
</P>
<P>
   In his online posting about the piece, Walton claimed the
painting has a inch-long hole caused by a child's Big Wheel. The
problem was, he has no children.
</P>
<P>
   He also claimed in the posting that his wife wouldn't let him
hang the picture in the house because she said it ``looks like it
was done by a nut case.'' The problem was, he has never been
married.
</P>
<P>
   Walton said Wednesday that he invented the tale as a funny story
to entertain bidders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought it was a cute little vignette to explain why I
was getting rid of a bunch of junk from the garage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His reputation was further tarnished by a report that he had run
into similar troubles last year, when he offered another painting
for sale on eBay.
</P>
<P>
   The piece had the signature, ``P. Gray,'' but Walton made no
claims as to the artist. Believing the piece was the work of early
20th century painter Henry Percy Gray, a Nebraska businessman
agreed to pay $7,600 for the work.
</P>
<P>
   When the businessman, Michael Luther, received the painting, he
found that the signature was a fraud, added years after the work
was completed. He threatened a lawsuit, but never filed one.
</P>
<P>
   Walton vehemently denied that he added a signature to any
painting.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone interview, Walton said he made a hobby of going to
garage sales and estate sales to find paintings. He said he had an
eye for rare finds and undervalued pieces. His profits would help
fund his fledgling law business, he said. He sold many of the
pieces on eBay under a third user-name, ``advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Walton argued that he had been mischaracterized in news stories
as devious and untrustworthy. But he admitted he brought much of
the negative coverage on himself.
</P>
<P>
   `I'm embarrassed by the whole thing. I hate the publicity,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   After the story broke this week, Walton pledged to have an
expert evaluate the painting. He said he wouldn't sell the work to
the buyer for $135,805 unless the piece was found to be a real
Diebenkorn.
</P>
<P>
   But Walton appeared to back off that pledge Wednesday. He said
it was too early to tell if he would sell the piece to the high
bidder or keep it himself.
</P>
<P>
   The high bidder, Robert Keereweer, a software executive from
Nieuwkoop, Netherlands, has said he wants to complete the sale, if
the painting is authentic.
</P>
<P>
   Keereweer said he believes the painting is a Diebenkorn after
seeing a photo online showing the signature, ``RD '52'' _ possibly
referring to the artist's initials and the year 1952. Once the hole
is fixed, the piece could be worth $500,000 to $1 million,
Keereweer said.
</P>
<P>
   Walton said he had no idea the piece could be a Diebenkorn
before he put it up for auction. He said he still doesn't know if
it's an original work.
</P>
<P>
   Diebenkorn, who died in 1993, was one of America's greatest 20th
century artists. He is associated with the rise of Abstract
Expressionism in the 1940s and 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Gretchen Grant, Diebenkorn's daughter said she doubts Walton's
painting is authentic, because there is no record of it in the
catalog of the painter's works.
</P>
<P>
   She said Walton had not contacted her about seeing the piece to
check if it matches her father's other works from the same period.
But Grant said she remains curious to find out if it's an
undiscovered piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's real ... I think that one always hopes for that,'' she
said. ``But there's another danger, that a work that isn't up to
the quality of the artist is being shown as the artist's work.''

GOLF'S GROWTH NUMBERS COULD BE MISLEADING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes 10-year growth text table.)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the National Golf Foundation released a report late last
year, the one that in essence said the much-ballyhooed golf boom
perhaps isn't much of a boom at all, there were plenty of numbers
for industry leaders to crunch with their morning tee times.
</P>
<P>
   Approaching doom, said some, shaken out of their spikeless shoes
because the number of golfers in this country (26.4 million) and
the amount of rounds played (530 million) weren't significantly
higher than they were in 1988. Factor in the finding that said for
every golfer brought into the game, one quit, and critics felt they
had evidence of cracks in the sport's foundation. Just look at the
spiraling golf stocks, the growing cost of equipment and tee times,
the abundance of upscale courses that are impossible for beginners,
and the reality that barely more than 5 million of those who play
are termed ``avid golfers,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the golf world, a universal chant percolated _ ``The
Three Toos, they called it, as in too expensive, too
time-consuming, too intimidating _ and it has grown loud enough so
that more and more industry people are challenging their colleagues
to open their eyes and ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf has burped,'' said Leigh Bader. ``For so long, people
have been so wrapped up in doing what they were doing, they forgot
why there were doing it. It's not that golf isn't healthy, it is.
OK, there are issues, but golf has always had issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only now the issues have changed and it's in our self-interest
as an industry to understand that the solution is simple.''
</P>
<P>
   From where he sits, which is in an office above a pro shop
jammed-packed with equipment at a nine-hole course he had the nerve
to think about buying 13 years ago, Bader has as meaningful a view
of the golf world as any industry CEO or blue-blazered USGA
official. Much of Bader's success is traced to a bold investment he
and partner Joe Ricci made for Pine Oaks GC in Easton, but this
innovative merchandiser said he is guided by a basic business
principal (``customer acquisition and retention'') as well as a
passionate commitment to pay off a priceless debt to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I buried frozen orange juice cans in my backyard to play
miniature golf,'' said Bader. ``My father brought me my first set
of clubs and took me to the course so he could have company. We
shared a love of this game. We need to have respect for the
institution of golf, and people in the industry need to think about
the values of the game and the quality it brings to the table. Golf
builds friendships.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he warned, the sport is not doing as much as it should to
encourage new friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``People at private country clubs will tell you, `We have 300
people on our waiting list. I don't know what the problem is,' ''
said Bader, shaking his head. ``Hello, I tell them,'' and he makes
like he is holding out a phone, ``Wake up. Where do you think your
members are coming from?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His office may be in St. Augustine, Fla., but Joe Louis Barrow
shares a view similar to Bader's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The golf industry has a wonderful opportunity to grow the
game,'' said Barrow, recently named national director of The First
Tee, a collaborative of golf organizations to build courses and
driving ranges which attract new players. When the NGF report was
issued, Barrow did not dwell on stagnant figures for
player-participation, number of rounds, or equipment sales.
Instead, he saw that ``41 million people expressed an interest in
taking up the sport or in essence wanted to re-engage their
interest'' and concluded that the game needs to capture a healthy
percentage of those people.
</P>
<P>
   To do so, said Barrow, the industry needs to reshape its
thinking and spend more time ushering players into a game that
everyone agrees is extremely difficult to learn. ``We need
non-traditional golf facilities where kids are welcomed and other
beginners, too,'' said Barrow. ``In essence, shorter, friendlier
courses with not too many bunkers, geared to encourage people to
come and have fun, to learn the game before they graduate to more
conventional golf courses.''
</P>
<P>
   Though they come from diverse backgrounds and are separated by
more than a thousand miles, Bader and Barrow are united in their
passion for the game and they can hear one another clearly. Their
fathers introduced them to golf and each man considers children
crucial to the sport's future health.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a farm league for the sport,'' said Bader. ``We've
taught over 3,000 kids over the years how to play the game, about
the business, and they go from here. But not all clubs share that
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   From his national perspective _ overseeing an organization that
is just three years old, one whose stated mission is to make golf
more affordable and accessible with a strong emphasis on
introducing kids of all races and economic backgrounds to the sport
_ Barrow understands the numbers are daunting. Minorities make up
27.6 percent of the US population, but just 5 percent of the
nation's golfers. Children 12-17 account for 14.4 percent of the US
population, but just 2 percent of them are introduced to the game
each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the brilliant opportunity for golf,'' said Barrow.
``The norm has been for parents, a sibling, perhaps an uncle to
introduce kids to the game, but we will be able to do that now and
those kids will encourage their parents to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The First Tee, said Barrow, has achieved its first goal _ to
have 100 golf facilities opened or under development by the end of
the year _ but the true measure of the initiative will not be
measured for a few years. He judges by what he has seen, and Barrow
said more minorities are coming into the game and more people are
being exposed to the sport thanks to what are termed
``non-traditional facilities,'' from three- to six- to nine-hole
courses, to driving ranges like the one in Charleston, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just came back from the dedication,'' said Barrow. ``It's
right in the heart of an urban area. It doesn't take up that much
ground, and kids can walk to it.''
</P>
<P>
   But once they walk to it, will they stay? Numbers in the NGF
report indicate there's a 50-50 chance they won't, and no one in
the golf industry likes those odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retention is a huge issue,'' said Ruffin Beckwith, senior vice
president of the World Golf Foundation. ``Attracting new golfers,
recruiting them to the sport, has not been a problem. But if 3
million people take it up, 3 million people will leave it.''
</P>
<P>
   Too expensive. Too time-consuming. Too intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When he heard that the NGF report had concluded with ``The Three
Toos,'' Bader shrugged. ``I said they had a meaningful grasp of the
obvious,'' for he had witnessed this dilemma first-hand for many
years.
</P>
<P>
   Though he appreciates the purpose of the study and concedes that
it will serve ``as a calling card for the industry to wake up,''
Bader cautions his colleagues to keep things in perspective, to
remember that golf is dwarfed in size, for instance, by
recreational fishing, which, if it were a corporation would rank
13th on the Fortune 500 list of America's largest businesses with
$108 billion contributed to the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The golf equipment industry was less than just $5 billion
world-wide,'' said Bader. ``Nike is a $9 billion company. WalMart
had $160 billion in sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me wrong. Golf is big. It's on the radar screen.
It's a pretty nice size, but I would say to those who think it's in
trouble: `How big should it be? There are 260 million people in
this country. What percentage of them should play?''
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis, said Bader, shouldn't be on quantity to quench
thirsty egos, but quality to assure the game's future. ``If we
provide good golf experiences, we will cultivate committed
golfers,'' he said. ``And committed golfers should be our goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Bader hopefully will hear other industry leaders say the same
thing in November when he attends a summit meeting in Florida,
hosted by the World Golf Foundation. The purpose of the gathering
is to figure out how to tap into those 41 million people who want
to play golf, or play more than they do.
</P>
<P>
   When he's there, Bader just may draw a bunch of circles for his
colleagues. The circles represent the many different agendas people
in the industry have _ equipment-makers, private clubs, municipal
course owners, food and beverage vendors, travel agents, PGA Tour
officials, USGA executives, golf course superintendents . . . the
list goes on and as he rattles off the names, Bader assigns each a
circle.
</P>
<P>
   The groups have various interests, so the circles are all over
the paper, but ``they overlap in one area,'' said Bader as he
shaded it in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The golfer. We're all in business because of the golfer.''

Golf participation has remained steady the past two years after a
jump in 1997 when Tiger Woods won the Masters. Participants are
defined as anyone 12 or older who played at least one round
(figures in millions): &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Toward the end of Jayne Anne Phillips's new
novel ``MotherKind,'' Kate Tateman, the book's protagonist,
momentarily slips away from the demands of caring for her newborn
baby and dying mother to think about an earlier, less encumbered
time in her life when she was footloose in India, a free spirit in
every sense of that '60s-spiked term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Success was so attainable as a Westerner tasting the exotic,''
Phillips has Kate musing, ``a temporary nun trying on spiritual
practice, a drifting, artistic traveler with no ties but aging
parents and happenstance alliances. Why not? They were all much
easier than parenthood, running a house others lived in, facing up
to the spiraling complications of intimacy with what felt to (Kate)
like a whole crowd, some of whom were blood-related to one another
but not to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``In finding her soft American life so demanding, she risked her
own contempt,'' writes Phillips, raising what some will inevitably
see as a window on the 47-year-old author's own passage into middle
age and motherhood.
</P>
<P>
   Now, drawing connections between fiction and autobiography is a
risky, often ill-informed business, as Phillips herself would be
the first to argue (and stridently so). Superficial resemblances
are sometimes that, nothing more _ and certainly not what turn
``real life'' into real art. Still, the parallels between
Phillips's own circumstances and Kate's are hard to ignore, maybe
impossible to resist.
</P>
<P>
   Like Phillips, Kate in ``MotherKind'' is a teacher and writer
who grew up in Appalachia and still locates her spiritual center
there, notwithstanding her worldy wanderings. Like Phillips, Kate,
too, has moved into a large house in the Boston area with her
future husband, a physician, and his two young sons by a previous
marriage. As with Phillips 15 years ago, the birth of Kate's first
child overlaps with the end stages of her mother's cancer, a
conjoining of intergenerational forces that throws the mundane
aspects of domesticity into cosmically sharp relief. Even Kate's
fictional neighborhood is the same one that lies just outside
Phillips's door, in the leafy hills above Brookline Village where
famous writers can pass for car-pooling moms and soccer practice
can take precedence over novel writing.
</P>
<P>
   Guarded as she usually is in answering questions about her own
family, Phillips acknowledges that her new novel closely tracks
aspects of her own not-so-long-ago life, even as she politely
discourages conversation about her children (now 15 and 11),
stepchildren, and husband, a cardiologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say that all my work, no matter how fantastic it
seems, is autobiographical at the core,'' says Phillips, seated at
her dining room table on a sun-splashed May morning. ``I certainly
drew on a sense of being enclosed in that kind of domestic feel
when you're raising young kids. And it very much comes out of my
sense of losing my mother, 15 years ago. I feel as if I have lived
two lives since then, my self in a way very separate from that
person _ at the same time informing (Kate's) life with a lot of
details I remember or invented.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the author continues, ``The real heart of the book is the
cyclical nature of time itself and how we fit into it. The
mother-daughter bond and how it's connected to the wash of
generations. That part I would say is autobiographical, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Would it not have been just as easy, though, she is asked, to
make Kate's husband, say, a tax attorney? Or the father of two
teenage daughters? To send Kate on a pilgrimage to Machu Picchu
rather than Kathmandu, one of Phillips's former haunts?
</P>
<P>
   Phillips laughs. ``I probably should have made him a tax
attorney,'' she replies. ``And I thought about making it a family
of girls, but that would have betrayed the sense of these two
women'' _ Kate and her mother, Katherine _ ``isolated in a
mother-daughter relationship. It was important that they be
surrounded by boys because it accentuated the loss of the female
line, that matriarchal aspect of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Phillips leans back in her chair. ``I remember thinking even two
to three years after my mother died that I hadn't really had time
to think about it,'' she says. ``I feel her death most keenly when
I go back home and see her friends, because they're the people who
remember her the way I remember her. So there's a funny kind of
distance about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what I myself was trying to find in the book,''
she adds quietly. ``I'll probably think about that when the
publication is completely over with. But I was involved in editing
it, in decisions about the cover, all those things that sort of
drag on. I've been thinking about this book more as an object, you
know, than what's inside the book.''
</P>
<P>
   That will change soon, for ``MotherKind,'' to be published by
Knopf this week, once again casts Phillips as among the singular
literary voices of her generation, a writer keenly attuned to the
deep themes of her time if not to the whims of the commercial
marketplace. Since bursting upon the scene in 1979 with ``Black
Tickets,'' a widely-praised short story collection, the West
Virginia native has won plaudits for her haunting tales of
isolation and obsession, of unfashioned lives and unrealized
dreams, of small-town traditions pitted against contemporary
cultural forces. Twenty years go, Nadine Gordimer called Phillips
``the best short story writer since Eudora Welty,'' and ever since
the critical bar has been set high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Machine Dreams'' (1984), Phillips's first novel, followed the
lives of four generations of a West Virginia family from the Great
Depression to the Vietnam war. Michiko Kakutani of The New York
Times lauded it as a ``seamless, magical novel,'' and it earned a
National Book Critics Circle Award nomination. Nurtured along the
way by Seymour Lawrence, the late publishing legend, who died just
before ``Shelter'' came out, Phillips became linked to a new
generation of women writers whose ranks include Lorrie Moore,
Louise Erdrich, Mona Simpson, and Bobbie Ann Mason. It did not hurt
her public image, either, that Phillips was _ and is _ strikingly
attractive, with long brown hair, soft features, and vixenish eyes.
As one British writer put it when her last novel appeared (Phillips
has a large and loyal readership overseas), she ``looks like the
original Biba babe.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But marriage and motherhood have demanded their sacrifices of
Phillips, too. ``Fast Lanes,'' her second story collection, was
published in 1987, and ``Shelter,'' her second novel, appeared 6
years ago. In the interim, Phillips has taught fiction and
literature courses _ at Harvard, Boston University, and most
recently at Brandeis _ but she has admittedly found it hard to
juggle familial duties with classroom work and writing. Her
literary output has suffered accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried to avoid teaching full time,'' she says, ``although
I did that for years, mostly while I was working, or rather not
working, on `Shelter.' I had a year's leave last year while I
finished this last novel.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips had intended to write ``MotherKind'' _ the title refers
to a nanny agency Kate employs, though it evokes a more univeral
concept of motherkind _ before she got to ``Shelter,'' she says,
``but I knew I wasn't ready to. And I still work very slowly. A lot
of the work is done in a very interior way, it's self-censored
before it reaches the page. Almost everything I write I end up
using, but I don't write quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The subject of Phillips's own mother comes up. Again, the
parallels to the fictional Katherine are obvious ones. Both are, or
were, strong, well-educated women who divorced their husbands,
taught school in their respective communities, and never strayed
from the small towns where their children had been raised, or at
least until illness forced them to rethink the meaning of home and
family. Phillips's mother, like Katherine, lived with her daughter
during the last year or so of her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``My real mother?'' Phillips repeats with a breath of surprise.
``Well, she was very different from the character in the book.
There is a flavor of the way she spoke, I guess. A flavor of the
energy between her and me.'' She pauses. ``She was just a much
bigger character than the one in the book. Any time you try to base
a character on the essence of a real person, it's like the blind
man and the elephant. You only have a tiny piece.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like Katherine, Phillips goes on, her mother evinced a ``clarity
of inner strength'' during her three-year battle with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a very vital, very organized, very accomplished person
who could do everything,'' Phillips says. ``And everything had to
be perfectly done. She was also an incredible cook, an incredible
gardener, an incredible quilter. The first time my mother ever
sewed anything, she made herself a tailored suit. She also had a
huge group of women friends, which was typical of the place I grew
up. Families there went back for generations. They weren't living
the kind of life we would now think of. When I go back now I don't
even recognize the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what maternal qualities she shares with her mother,
Phillips hesitates. ``She didn't have to carve out time to do the
thing that she did, which is my situation'' with writing, Phillips
answers. ``I have an adjacent consciousness that works in a silent,
subconscious way while I'm dealing with getting dinner or teaching
class. Which is how artists get through the day. So in a sense her
example is a bad example for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips laughs. ``For her,'' she says, ``everything had to be
done and be done perfectly. And she was able to do that. My kids
see me as overinvolved and overprotective. My mother was big on
holidays like Christmas, and I have the same compulsion. I love old
toys, old photos, old ornaments. Something about them make me
incredibly happy. Seasonal rituals are really important to me,
because we don't have many of those now. We live in isolated
fashion, surrounded by people we're not necessarily connected to.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I'd say my parenting is based on the example my mother set,
but I'm living in a completely different world,'' Phillips says.
``I'm a little bit, uh, not in synch.''
</P>
<P>
   Already embarked on her next book, Phillips says she wants to
concentrate on writing novels, not short stories, because ``all my
stories are inside my novels at this point. I want a different sort
of process now.''
</P>
<P>
   Showing a visitor her elegant backyard garden, Phillips remarks
that ``MotherKind'' is fundamentally about an idea threaded
throughout her fiction: the idea of what constitutes ``home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As Kate's father states,'' says Phillips, ``home is not where
you live but where you come from. I'm interested in the sense of
home as a spiritual thing. Something that you carry with you from
your origins, and that there's nothing wrong with that. How you
separate from home in the same way you separate from your parents,
that paradox of presence and loss and of understanding the one
through the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Details of her home life _ what one might call ``the spiraling
complications of intimacy'' _ are less important, Phillips
suggests. ``I think it would be more interesting,'' she says with a
laugh, ``if you said I was married to a roofer.''

GIVE YOUR GARDEN CONSTANT COLOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The yellow forsythia, the pink magnolias. So beautiful. So
brief. So finished for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Does beauty in the garden have to be so . . . temporary?
</P>
<P>
   Many yards look colorful in spring and then seem to take the
rest of the year off. If you install flowers that you like
willy-nilly, you'll probably get a May-June garden, because that's
when most plants bloom.
</P>
<P>
   It takes planning and know-how to get continuous garden color
July through September, the months when we actually spend a lot of
time outside, so we solicited tips from professional landscape
designers whose jobs involve keep clients happy year-round.
</P>
<P>
   Their tricks include: employing colored foliage; planting
annuals and tropicals; selecting plants that bloom later in the
season; pruning after the first flush of flowers to get plants to
bloom a second time; and using plants with multiple interest.
</P>
<P>
   So take heart. Thanks to the increasing availability of many new
kinds of annuals, tropical plants, and tender perennials, the
options for season-long color in the garden are radically
expanding.
</P>
<P>
   --Colored foliage: This is the favorite new tactic in the color
wars. After all, flowers don't last all season, but foliage does.
</P>
<P>
   Colored foliage was long considered in questionable taste.
Silver dusted stachys or gently variegated vinca was admissible,
but the eye-popping colored patterns on coleus leaves were regarded
as a surviving example of Victorian excess. But now coleus and
other hot-hued foliage are the rage. What changed?
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, people got tired of pastels. And once they
experimented with bright colors, a wave of tropical plants too
intriguing to resist hit the market. Also, breeders introduced new
versions of old standbys, like coral bells with purple leaves. Now
there are perennials, annuals, bulbs, and shrubs with colored or
variegated leaves at every garden center.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to overdo this, however, so use such lively leaves for
accents. Most are either chartreuse or purple, compatible colors,
but they don't look great mixed with the green variegated foliage
with white margins, also popular now.
</P>
<P>
   Colored shrubs have the strongest impact and add structure to
flower gardens, but most quickly outgrow their allotted space.
Landscape designer Warren Leach of Tranquil Lake Nursery in
Rehoboth, Mass. solves this by cutting shrubs severely each year.
Since you're growing them for their foliage, you don't have to
worry about cutting off the flower buds. He recommends purple smoke
bush, and ninebark, which has chartreuse foliage all summer. His
new favorite is Ogon, a bridal wreath spirea with chartreuse
leaves, which also has white flowers in April.
</P>
<P>
   The new varieties of cannas with brilliantly striped foliage
have upstaged the green-leafed variety and beg to be planted where
they can be backlit to duplicate a summer sunset. Other popular
tender bulbs (dig them up in the fall and store them in the
basement) inlude purple-leaved dahlias such as Bishop of
Llanddaff. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Annual impact &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Annuals and tropicals: Planting annuals has been the
time-honored way to get color throughout the summer if your garden
has full sun. While perennials are the ants of the garden _
blooming briefly, then saving up energy to survive another year _
annuals are the grasshoppers, blooming all summer long with no
thought of winter. They're more work, though, because they require
replanting each May and June as well as frequent watering and
deadheading, which means removing the spent blossoms before the
plants go to seed.
</P>
<P>
   But annuals are definitely the way to go if you want a big
impact from a small garden, or want to brighten up the front rows
of larger borders. For a unified effect, avoid mixes and buy annual
flats in a single color.
</P>
<P>
   White cosmos is probably the best all-around annual. It's
graceful, goes with anything, and is good for cutting. Westwood,
Mass. landscape architect Joseph Hudak's favorites are the ones the
rabbits won't eat. So he's replaced petunias with snapdragons from
the Rocket series and cleome, which self-seeds in his garden.
</P>
<P>
   Leach also likes cheerful Lemon and Tangerine Gem Marigolds,
spreading integrifolia petunias, tall skinny Verbena bonariensis,
and heliotrope. Despite its reputation, I've never found heliotrope
from garden centers to be particularly fragrant, but Leach says
that to get a good scent, they have to be grown from cuttings, not
seed.
</P>
<P>
   Many annuals are really perennials growing too far north. More
people are using tropical perennials as annuals because they put
out blooms all season long. Salvia guaranitica is prized for its
colbalt blue flowers. Deborah Howard, who runs Howard Garden
Designs Inc. in Newton, Mass. with her architect daughter Karen,
likes Salvia splendens Van Houttei, which spreads 3 feet and is
covered with ``gorgeous blood red flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   You can also grow treasured tropicals like hibiscus or bananas
as houseplants and simply move the pot onto the patio each summer. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Long-blooming perennials &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Summer bloomers: Most perennials bloom for only two to three
weeks. Long-blooming exceptions include blue Russian sage, golden
rudbeckia, and purple coneflower for summer, fall-bloom boltonia,
and various sedums, such as Autumn Joy. But it takes a giant border
to achieve all-season bloom with only perennials because you need
to include so many different kinds.
</P>
<P>
   So, many people add roses, which have the longest bloom period
of any shrub. Older types tend to be scant of bloom in high summer
unless you pick more heat-resistant varieties such as Betty Prior
and the Fairy, or the newer low-maintenance varieties such as
Carefree Beauty and Carefree Wonder. Designers also praised the
super-hardy Explorer series from Canada, particularly Henry Hudson
and Champlain and the musk single pink rose Ballerina.
</P>
<P>
   Hydrangeas are popular summer-blooming shrubs these days, but
unless you live in a warmer location like Cape Cod, pass up the
celebrated blue hortensia varieties in favor of super-hardy white
Annabell. It stays small and you can cut it down like a perennial
in the fall without sacrificing flowers.
</P>
<P>
   --Pruning: Some perennials will rebloom if they are cut back
after the first flowering. Howard cuts mauve catmint to the ground
after the stems fall open to get fresh new leaves and flowers. If
delphiniums are deadheaded, they will send up new shoots that will
flower in the fall if the old stems are cut down soon after the new
ones appear.
</P>
<P>
   Phlox is the backbone of the English summer garden, but many
people here have abandoned it because it requires a lot of water
and gets ugly mildew in our climate. However, designers are
enthusiastic about a new mildew-resistant white variety called
David. ``As with any phlox, you have to pinch back all but six
stems when it sprouts, and then pinch it as it grows to make it
bushy,'' says Howard. ``Then keep deadheading it to keep it
reblooming.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Double planting &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Multiple interest: You need a big yard for this, since most
plants that have multiple interest are trees or shrubs like crab
apples or viburnums with spring flowers and fall berries or
foliage. A few perennials actually have brilliant fall foliage,
especially the perennial geraniums.
</P>
<P>
   You can also do double planting: Put daffodil and crocus bulbs
in the same hole with day lilies during fall planting, or combine a
summer-blooming Clematis viticella vine with a lilac.
</P>
<P>
   --A word about shade: It's a test of ingenuity to get
season-long color in shade, hence the huge popularity of impatiens.
Nicotianas are among the few other annuals that will bloom without
a lot of sunlight. Look for Nicky Hybrids' Lime Green, langsdorfii,
another classy green flower, and alata, a white species with great
evening fragrance, suggests Leach.
</P>
<P>
   Perennial red-flowering astilbes such as Federsee or Blut
(that's German for blood) have reddish leaves for extra interest.
Of course, the best foliage plants for shade are hostas, which are
available in innumerable combinations of green and chartreuse, as
well as blue-green. The new lysimachia nummularia Aurea is a ground
cover with lime-green foliage (no flowers) that provides contrast
to other greens. Emerald 'N Gold is one of several colorful
evergreen euonymus for shade.
</P>
<P>
   Hudak, whose new book is ``Design for Gardens'' (Timber Press),
finds flowering wax begonias ``very dependable.'' But he warns that
tuberous begonias ``are susceptible to meltdown. . . . Everyone
loves the flowers because it's a greenhouse-raised thing. Then they
put in it in their garden and it falls apart.''
</P>
<P>
   The more you learn, the more you'll see that the possible
combinations for season-long color are infinite.

IT'S DECK SEASON AGAIN, WITH ALL ITS HEADACHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ah, the sunshine of May has finally dried out the world and
heated the air just enough to enjoy the outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   And that means basking on the deck, that wonderful collection of
boards raised from the ground and set up just like an outdoor room.
</P>
<P>
   But just look around you, particularly at that deck. It's dirty,
too dirty to be a rug rat on. Maybe it has black mold and mildew
growing on it. Maybe even green algae or lichen.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the ends of the boards are splitting, or you are getting
splinters in your toes or other sensitive anatomical parts from the
rough surface.
</P>
<P>
   And, it needs restaining and-or resealing.
</P>
<P>
   So, back to work to spruce up that deck, because Mr. and Mrs.
America, especially Mrs., want an outdoor floor surface to be
antiseptically clean with no maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   It's an American dream turned into a nightmare. Fact: There is
no way you can keep an outdoor floor clean without daily treatment.
First, you have to clean your dirty deck. And use bleach with the
wash if there is black mold or green algae on the deck. Or,
pressure wash. Then seal or stain. It's quite a spring project for
Mr. America, who just wants to relax.
</P>
<P>
   The nightmare started when pressure-treated wood was developed.
Yes, there were decks before (let's call it) P-T wood, but they did
not last long and were painted (before stains came along), and the
paint peeled, another nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   P-T was supposed to be the be-all and end-all. No more
maintenance. Let the wood weather to a nice gray color and it will
last for 50 to 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Guess again. P-T wood, installed full of water, shrank when it
dried out, and then split, spalled (chunks coming right off the top
surfaces), and splintered.
</P>
<P>
   So, deck sealers were developed to prevent the splits, spalls,
and splinters. Trouble is, the sealer lasted only a year or so,
requiring reapplication each year, or every two years at the very
most. So much for low or no maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   And, if you have checked a paint or lumber store recently, you
will see many, many sealers on the market, all with claims that
they are better than the other. All are proprietary, meaning the
formula is secret, and you have no idea what is in those cans.
</P>
<P>
   You can be pretty safe in assuming that the products are
similar.
</P>
<P>
   So, you continue with the sealing, as the company suggests. Year
after year.
</P>
<P>
   This is the price that Mr. and Mrs. America pay for a deck they
can eat off.
</P>
<P>
   There is some hope remaining for the deck owner who says pooh to
all that. He can apply a semitransparent stain, which will, or
should, last longer than the sealer, maybe up to three years.
</P>
<P>
   Another solution is to install Trex or PVC (vinyl) floor boards
in place of what is there now. Vinyl is vinyl, as we all know, and
it might be a pretty good choice. Trex is a combination of ground
plastic bottles and ground wood. It, like vinyl, resists chipping,
splintering, and splitting, and does not have to be sealed or
stained, although it can be.
</P>
<P>
   And, there are other kinds of wood that can be used, such as
mahogany (looks great, weathers to a real silver color), fir, and
cedar. But choosing any of these woods will not get you off the
hook of regular sealing and staining.
</P>
<P>

   John Princiotta of Boxborough, Mass. has been a painter for 15
years, and got a little tired of the miseries of painting outdoors,
and the perpetual, it seemed, peeling problem that so many houses
have.
</P>
<P>
   He noticed that there are decks everywhere (millions in the
United States) so why not come to everyone's rescue and just do
decks: clean, seal, and-or stain, and let Mr. America relax, for a
fee?
</P>
<P>
   And that is what he does in summer. In winter he does indoor
painting. ``But I do not paint decks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he does 500 decks a year, and would like to do more. He
charges $400 for a medium-sized deck (10 by 20 feet); subsequent
treatments, per year, are $250. He will travel: ``I cover the
Eastern third of Massachusetts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Princiotta cleans with bleach and water for mold, also uses
acids and wood brighteners such as DeckWash. He'll also pressure
wash, but not too often, because he says he is not geared up for
it.
</P>
<P>
   As for the type of wood, Princiotta says cedar and fir do better
in sunlight. ``I do not recommend pressure treated for flooring
because it splits,'' although it is acceptable for the framing. He
recommends cedar or mahogany for deck floors. To keep the mahogany
dark, he uses Moore's semitransparent stain. Even mahogany or cedar
will split if left untreated in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally like a fir floor sealed or stained. And rails and
spindles of cedar,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While he will apply a semitransparent stain, he feels that for
deck floors, even such a stain is not much good for more than one
year, disputing the claim that a stain can last up to three years.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, however, a repeat treatment in one year may not be
necessary. ``I test the old finish for beading up. If water beads
up on the old finish, there is no treatment needed,'' he said.
Until perhaps next year. But no paint.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone interestd in having a deck done can call Princiotta at
978-266-1341.
</P>
<P>
   Princiotta plans to franchise his business, authorizing other
painters and dealers to do projects. ``First the state, then the
country,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He will call the company Global Deck Cleaning and Staining.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, if you get tired of cleaning the deck or paying for
treatments, you can build a masonry patio and repeat, ``I will not
wash my patio'' 500 times.

OWNERS OF VINTAGE CARS THINK THEY CAN CLIMB THE HILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GRIFFITH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, Vt. _ Hill climbs are a throwback to an era when
people first wanted to see if their cars could make it up the
mountain and then how fast they could make the climb.
</P>
<P>
   Thus we give you the Mount Equinox Hillclimb, an annual weekend
of vintage car racing under the auspices of the Vintage Sports Car
Club of America.
</P>
<P>
   It's an event that continues because, in the words of the club's
Karen Miller: ``Promises that were made by people who are now dead
to other people who also are now dead are being honored by their
heirs.''
</P>
<P>
   The original promises were made by the Davidson Family, who
owned the mountain, completed an unpaved road to the summit, and
built the Skyline Inn (now the Equinox Mountain Inn) in the late
1940s.
</P>
<P>
   The promises were made to the Sports Car Club of America, which
had asked permission to conduct a hill climb on the Davidsons'
road.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the event was held in various months and under
the auspices of various clubs until 1973 when it finally settled
into an early-summer event conducted by the VSCCA.
</P>
<P>
   As a vintage car event, only prewar race cars and a limited
number of rare and unusual postwar cars built before 1960 are
considered for entry. This is the other end of the hill-climbing
spectrum from the the Pikes Peak-type of all-out assaults on time
and height.
</P>
<P>
   The Davidsons bequeathed the mountain to the Carthusian Monks, a
cloistered order who have made the area their only Western
Hemisphere monastery. A business arm of the monastery, run by
mountain manager Jerry Madison, oversees the inn, toll road,
hydroelectric system (the monks have a series of seven man-made
ponds and a man-made lake), and radio tower rentals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our event continues to run at their (the monks') good
graces,'' said club editor and mountain historian Jim Donick. ``I'm
sure they have reservations about people risking their lives on
their mountain in this event, but they've been willing to continue
the tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, the racers have little contact with the monks, but
there have been a few notable exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   One year, a young monk from France who had been a racer silently
watched the event with the permission of Father Prior Diamond.
</P>
<P>
   Another year, recalled Bob Girvin, event chairman for 15 years,
a young man arrived for a vocational retreat.
</P>
<P>
   The monastery was alerted and the prior came down to greet the
newcomer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's their mountain and their road,'' said Girvin, and if they
wish to use the road, our event stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The race was red-flagged while the prior came down and chatted
with the young man. Then they started back up the mountain. Our
radio spotters reported they passed the first checkpoint, then . .
. nothing. After a while, I started back up the hill and found them
stopped in the middle of the road in deep conversation absolutely
oblivious that the race was waiting on them,'' said Girvin.
</P>
<P>
   The outside world was recognized, the pair moved on, and the
race continued as it does today, the sporting equivalent of a
handshake deal.
</P>
<P>
   The event's only fatality occurred in 1956 when Paul Flickinger
pushed a little too hard in trying to break five minutes in a
prewar Maserati Grand Prix racer. The car spun into a post and his
pressurized fuel tank ruptured and spread a spray of methanol fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question there's an element of danger in the event
even today,'' said Donick. That applies to both the cars, which are
self-insured by the owners, and the drivers, who are covered by a
club medical policy in addition to their personal insurance.
</P>
<P>
   But, that being said, the logistics are impressive. Ambulances
and medical personnel are at various checkpoints on the 5.3-mile
climb and a radio-network of corner workers keeps virtually the
entire course under surveillance with ``chase cars'' ready to
respond if a car stops along the way.
</P>
<P>
   The entry list for last year's race read like a museum's
collection with names such as Lotus, Allard, Kurtis, Porsche,
MG-TD, Alfa-Romeo, Jaguar, Cooper, Fiat-Abarth.
</P>
<P>
   Notable among them was a 1915 Stutz Bearcat owned by Bob Reed.
It has a 450-cubic-inch, 4-cylinder, T-head engine, just like the
one that was raced successfully (11th place) at Indianapolis in
1911. Reed has driven it all over Europe and through the Alps.
</P>
<P>
   It looked sensational heading up Equinox, but it didn't make it
to the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too steep,'' said Reed. ``The incline was too much, even in
first gear, then it got hot and didn't want to run.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Carlisle's Dudley Cunningham won the King of the
Mountain title in his 1957 Lotus racer in 4:39.50, one of five
participants who broke the five-minute barrier.
</P>
<P>
   But, in this event, racers basically try to better their car's
previous fastest time to the summit because they're anything but an
evenly matched group.
</P>
<P>
   Girvin's car, for example, is a one-of-a-kind Allard coupe. The
factory made two, one Jaguar-powered that now resides in a British
museum, and his, originally owned by the duPont Family with a
393-cubic-inch Chrysler hemi engine.
</P>
<P>
   For a first-time spectator, the event was a bit of a
disappointment. Every six or seven minutes you'd hear the wonderful
sound of an engine straining up the mountain to your vantage point.
Then it would flash around a corner into view, accelerate past,
maybe slide a tad on the next corner and disappear away.
</P>
<P>
   The surprising treat?
</P>
<P>
   Watching the cars come down in groups of three and four at the
end of each run was as much a pleasure as the competitive aspect of
the climb.
</P>
<P>
   Which just goes to prove that what goes up, must come . . . .

THE ODD MASTERMIND BEHIND WEB SATIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the great things about the Internet is that it channels
the energy of some quirky folks who might otherwise spend their
time firing off letters to the editor, hunting down space aliens,
or walking down Main Street au naturel.
</P>
<P>
   Take HC, the solitary force behind www.c3f.com, a labyrinthine
site that includes ``the Net's only sorta daily satire column.''
For five years now, this esoteric individual has created twisted
commentaries that are either drop-dead funny or simply defy
explanation. The most recent offering is an animated image of Bill
Gates's head being split in two, revealing less-than cerebral
matter. On Tax Day, the site featured a California tax form with a
scrolling stock ticker tape and instructions that were, like,
totally la-la.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't your typical text-only satire, like The Onion. HC is
one of the only people out there using the technology of the
Internet to satirize news, pop culture, or whatever happens to be
bugging him. Click on the item slugged ``Earthquake Hallucinating
Rampant,'' and the screen shakes. Dig into the archives and watch
the ``1997 Year in Review Generator'' spew out wacko headlines
mixing references to Mother Theresa, Frank Gifford, and Dolly the
Sheep. The sensibility is best described as postmodern geek, like
Don DeLillo meets Max Headroom meets Mad magazine. Admittedly, it's
an acquired taste.
</P>
<P>
   So who is the mastermind of this maze? His real name is Howard
Cohen, a 39-year-old former programmer in Del Mar, Calif. He
started the site back in 1995 to sell his novel online. ``It's not
a standard novel,'' Cohen says. ``It doesn't have character and
stories and sex and violence and blah, blah, blah.'' It also
doesn't have a name that can be printed in a family newspaper; for
short, it's known as ``MFU.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first novels online, it hasn't exactly taken off,
although Cohen did get the thing published by an obscure small
press and has sold ``hundreds'' of copies. Most of the novel is
still posted on the massive site, tucked away in an elaborate
parody of the online magazine Slate.
</P>
<P>
   The satire section uses a name that is a takeoff on The
Washington Post. In the early days, Cohen called the parody The New
Times York _ until he heard from the lawyers. The cease and desist
letter from the Times is still posted on the site: It seems the
powers that be objected to the use of the slogan, ``All the news
that's fit to sell Toyotas.'' Cohen changed the name to The Street
Wall Journal, which didn't last long either. He has heard from the
Post's lawyers, but he took his chances; so far, they've let him
be. His next target would have been a local paper called The Austin
Lobe. That would have been fun.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Cohen has plenty of time on his hands. Years ago, he
made a bunch of money as a programmer, and he hasn't had to work
ever since. Instead, he spends all his time pushing the boundaries
of Web satire. ``I'm not addicted to the Web; I'm addicted to
writing and producing stuff,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And there sure is a lot of it. The site is an endless series of
links, complete with the ``sorta daily'' stuff as well as parodies
of ancient Web sites, including the old Microsoft Network and
Time-Warner's defunct Pathfinder site. In its own bizarre way, this
self-contained universe chronicles a five-year history of pop
culture, politics, and the Internet itself.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen seems happily immersed in this world: He doesn't get out
much. In fact, he can go for weeks without leaving the house. ``I'm
a total recluse,'' he explains. ``I want to challenge J.D. Salinger
to a contest to see who is the better recluse. I think I have him
beat.'' Oh, and he also doesn't talk very much; there have been
weeks when the only word he said was ``plastic'' _ as in ``Paper or
plastic?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, now he orders his groceries online. What about
clothes? ``I don't have to wear clothes,'' he says. ``In fact, as I
speak to you, I am utterly, absolutely naked. It's good when
Jehovah's witnesses answer the door.'' Is he kidding? Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another Internet First!!! It's called ``Quantum Project,'' and
it's being billed as the ``first Internet feature film with an
established crew and cast.'' That may or may not be true; there are
thousands of films available online. Nevertheless, the 31-minute
film was made exclusively for distribution on the Internet and
produced by the folks who made ``What Dreams May Come.'' The film
stars Fay Masterston, Stephen Dorff, and John Cleese; Dorff plays a
physicist looking for love. For $5.95, users can download this
sci-fi romance from www.sightsound.com (which financed the $3
million film) and from www.quantumprojectthemovie.com. Download
time is expected to be 10 minutes on a broadband connection or four
hours on a low-speed modem. If the technology works and the film is
worth watching, this may be the beginning of a new era of film
distribution. (And Cohen will never have to leave the house to get
a video ever again.)

WHAT COMPUTER GAMES CAN'T TEACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   E-mail from Eileen: ``I can understand why your granddaughter's
Waldorf school might de-emphasize TV, but not computer use. Don't
you want your grandchild to be prepared for the future?''
</P>
<P>
   Good question, Eileen. How can we prepare young children for the
future? I think about that every Nana Day _ my weekly time with my
grandchildren _ when Danny, 6, and I are exploding volcanoes and
Jess, 9, and I are constructing a dollhouse from a kit. We also
read, climb rocks, paint, sew, cook, and follow our curiosity. In
comparison, playing with my computer was easier and far less messy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I gave up on educational computer games after Danny and I
built a birdhouse together. On the screen was a perfect image, but
I realized that all Danny had done to create it was click the
mouse. In every piece of software I'd purchased the images kept
changing, but the child's task remained the same _ simply more
clicking.
</P>
<P>
   The difference became all the more apparent when Danny and I
decided to build a birdhouse. The nails bent, the wood split, the
final product was a disaster by all standards but our own. Real
life demanded a higher level of competence, and it taught us what
we needed to know for our next project, a sailboat. This time we
measured more carefully. We thought twice and cut once. Danny
slammed the hammer straight down. I protected my fingers. We made
real progress.
</P>
<P>
   Television, you know, was also once considered the great
uplifter, a powerful tool for educating the masses, but we ended up
instead with a selling machine. We have a long history of
technological wonders _ I remember film strips _ which failed to
deliver the results they promised, and I'm convinced this one is no
different. There's no way a machine can teach young children what
they need to know about being human.
</P>
<P>
   I'm writing this on my old Power Mac, which is already obsolete.
It offers no clue to the state of the art 10 years from now. Young
children need to develop inner qualities that will prepare them for
what we have not yet imagined, and since computers do only what the
human mind dictates, it's crucial to develop in children qualities
needed to improve computers, not merely operate them, qualities
such as:
</P>
<P>
   --Flexibility of mind. The computer, a rigid taskmaster, allows
no room for alternative choices of effective action. The vast
majority of computer programs teach young children there is only
one right answer.
</P>
<P>
   --Trust in themselves. The computer acts as the ultimate
arbiter. In computer-based learning, the machine denies the self
any role in setting standards for satisfactory progress.
</P>
<P>
   --Creativity. Computer programs, for the most part, supply all
the ingredients. The child must select from a prepared menu and as
a result is forced to operate within the limits of the programmer's
imagination rather than discovering the dimensions of her own.
</P>
<P>
   --A range and depth of experience. Computers provide visual cues
and sounds. Children, however, are embodied creatures whose thought
processes are stimulated by all five senses. Experts agree that
learning through the manipulation of objects, physical activity,
and spontaneous play builds the complex neural circuitry needed for
later abstract thinking.
</P>
<P>
   --The motivation to learn, not merely perform. Computers are
operant-conditioning machines that use various rewards as
reinforcement. Young children learn to perform in order to see
dancing ducks or shoot trash from space, activities that diminish
the importance of the task itself. Such rewards can come to replace
personal motivation and the satisfaction of working hard to
accomplish a conscious goal.
</P>
<P>
   For a fuller examination of the computer as a learning tool, I
recommend Jane Healy's ``Failure to Connect: How Computers Affect
Our Children's Minds _ For Better and Worse'' (Touchstone).
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that computers are not useful tools,
especially for older children with strong motivation, an ability to
focus and organize their thoughts, a capacity for sustained work,
an integrated emotional, social, and intellectual life, and a
guiding sense of values. They must bring these traits to the
computer. They cannot find them there.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who spends time with youngsters knows they are capable of
great flights of imagination and intuition, profound moral
judgments, surprising insights, powerful spiritual longings, and a
joyful receptivity to the world at large. Only other human beings
can inspire children to value and develop and rely upon these
strengths in themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Why would we ever entrust young children to a machine that lacks
them?

<P>
   WINTERPORT, Maine _ Truth be told, there aren't a lot of places
for someone to drop a dollar or two in this little town hugging the
Penobscot River a couple of Tiger Woods drives south of Bangor.
</P>
<P>
   You've got The Flower Patch, T. Tasket's Baskets, Bayside Video
Variety &AMP; Laundromat, Dean's Discount Tires, Varney Insurance
Agency, Kaler St. Music, The Drydock (``Winterport's Family
Restaurant''), and El-Hajj's Market, recently relocated to larger
quarters a few blocks south of its original location.
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, you've got the Winterport House of Pizza,
which happens to be Ground Zero for discussion and analysis of
Winterport's official favorite sun and the only current Maine
product in the majors (and one of the few Downeasters ever). For
only at the Winterport House of Pizza is the specialty of the house
a thick Bordyburger.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, proprietor Dave Wilson serves up the expected pizza,
calzones, and subs. But if you want a full Winterport experience,
you must order a Bordyburger, which, as the menu explains, ``is a
double cheesburger with savory onions, pickle slices, crisp
lettuce, and a TOP secret sauce, served with oven fries.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Wilson is no front-runner. He was serving up Bordyburgers
even before Mike Bordick, his old high school running buddy,
started putting up A-Rod/Derek/Nomar numbers as the Baltimore
Orioles' starting shortstop. When a guy makes it out of Winterport,
Hampden Academy, the Bangor American Legion, and the University of
Maine to become a big league ballplayer, that's a major story in
and of itself. And never mind him becoming one of the game's great
defensive shortstops or establishing an Oriole record for April
runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Winterport have an unconditional love for their
man Mike that transcends the latest statistics. ``He is polite,
sweet and sincere,'' said Jo-Ann Barrows, a family friend who is an
administrative assistant to the school superintendent. ``He has
never stopped being friends with my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor he has ever stopped being just plain Mike to Dave Wilson.
The two went to Hampden Academy (the regional high school serving
Hampden, Winterport, and Newburgh) and were in each other's
weddings. ``When he calls during the season,'' Wilson said, ``we
never talk about baseball. It's about families or fishing or
something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now if Bordick were the self-promoting sort, he'd be bragging
about the best start of a career that began with the Oakland A's in
1990. Heading into Wednesday night's game in Toronto, the
34-year-old shortstop was hitting .353 with seven homers and 32
runs batted in. To put it into perspective, his previous big league
triple crown stat highs were .300 (in 1992), 13 home runs (in '98),
and 77 (in '99).
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that the bat is a bonus. Bordick already has a
first-class reputation in every American League dugout for what he
does in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funny you should be asking me about Mike Bordick,'' Don Zimmer
said before Sunday's Yankees-Orioles game. ``Joe Torre and I were
sitting in the dugout the other night talking about him. He makes a
great play against us to start a double play, and I said, `They
talk about (Seattle's Alex) Rodriguez and the guy in Cleveland
(Omar Vizquel), and our guy (Derek Jeter) and your guy (Nomar
Garciaparra), and this guy plays that position as well as anybody.'
Day-in, day-out, he does a hell of a job. I don't know him at all,
but I really like him. I love watching him play. I call him
`Tough.' He is tough as nails.''
</P>
<P>
   Not an hour later, Jorge Posada hit a single up the middle,
except that Bordick made a superb play to his left and threw him
out. You could just see Zimmer giving Torre an ``I told you so''
elbow nudge in the ribs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Bordick is simply one of those professionals you never
have to worry about,'' said Baltimore manager Mike Hargrove. ``He
is thoroughly professional in the way he goes about his business.
He is the consummate professional. He never offers an excuse when
anything goes wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Who saw all this coming when Bordick was hitting .201 for the
legendary John Winkin as a freshman at the University of Maine? Who
could possibly have seen this coming when, following a great junior
year (.364), three of his teammates were drafted while his name was
never called? OK, there was somebody, but somebody with an
asterisk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one person who always believed he would make it was his
father, Mike,'' said Barrows. ``His father was behind him the whole
way.''
</P>
<P>
   But his father couldn't get him into professional baseball. The
man who did that was Oakland scout J.P. Ricciardi, who spotted
Bordick playing for the Yarmouth/Dennis Red Sox in the Cape League,
and who took a chance on that rarest of all American species: a
position player from Maine. The state's last three noted exports to
the bigs had all been pitchers (Carlton Willey, Jim Beattie, and
fellow Black Bear Bill Swift), and whose most storied product, Old
Town's Louis Sockalexis, was born 128 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The young Bordick wasn't exactly overflowing with bravado.
``Just like any other kid, I dreamed of being in the big leagues,''
said Bordick. ``But it really didn't seem to be a realistic goal
until I had played a couple of years in the minors.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer isn't surprised to hear that. During his 52 years in
organized baseball he has been a frequent eyewitness as kids from
cold climes try to establish themselves in competition with the Sun
Belt set. ``I've seen these young kids from New England and they'd
be way behind the kids from California, Texas, and Florida who were
playing 40 or 50 high school games a year, as opposed to 17 or
18,'' Zimmer said. ``But sometimes all you need to do is come back
three months later to see a difference. You can't make quick
judgments on these kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The University of Maine was a high-powered program that went to
the College World Series twice while Bordick was there. But the
state of Maine is still the state of Maine and one of the great
Bordick stories concerns a four-error game against Vermont in what
could only be described as a snowstorm. A kid from Scottsdale,
Ariz., doesn't have this on his resume.
</P>
<P>
   But Bordick had great hands, for one thing, and great resolve,
for another. He soaked up knowledge from the likes of Double A
manager Tommy Reynolds and Oakland manager Tony La Russa, who
demonstrated his deep feelings for the kid shortstop in the
penultimate day of the 1992 season. Bordick had singled off Juan
Nieves and homered off James Austin to put his average at .2996,
and thus making him an official .300 hitter, but La Russa still
took him out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Recalled Bordick, ``He came up to me and said, `I had the
opportunity to hit .300 once in the minors in a similar situation,
and I didn't do it. I want you to be rewarded for a great season.'
I told him I wanted to play, but I'd do whatever he said.''
</P>
<P>
   The closest he's come to .300 since was .277 last year, but he
has rewarded La Russa's 1992 contention that there was ``hidden
pop'' in his bat with home run totals of 13 in '98 and 10 last
year. As for this year's numbers, Bordick's classic explanation is
that ``there have been a lot of guys on base for me.''
</P>
<P>
   He is, of course, The Man Who Made Cal Expendable, signing a
free agent contract in December 1996. Although he downplays the
idea of it being any big deal, his skipper begs to differ. ``There
definitely was pressure on the guy taking Cal's place at
shortstop,'' said Hargrove, who took over the Orioles this year
after nine seasons with the Indians. ``I can remember how tough it
was on Doug DeCinces when he replaced Brooks Robinson at third. We
were good friends and we talked about it all the time. Those things
aren't easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove considers himself blessed. He's got himself a
shortstop's shortstop, a guy who, as Hargrove says, ``Catches every
ball you're supposed to catch.'' As for the batting part, Hargrove
chuckles. ``Would I have expected these kind of numbers? No. But I
can tell you he was a real Indian-killer, so maybe I'm not all that
surprised,'' he said. ``What is obvious is that he's getting better
every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Full disclosure: Mike Bordick wasn't born in Maine. He lived in
Marquette, Mich., until his family moved to Winterport as he was
entering his sophomore year in high school. But he learned how to
play ball there and he feels like a Maine guy, which is all that
counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of being able to represent Maine in the big
leagues,'' he said. ``I always remember something (Old Town's) Dick
McPherson used to tell me. He'd say, `People in Maine persevere.' I
think that's what I've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Just remember one thing: Out of 750 big league players (not
counting guys on the disabled list), only one comes from Maine.
That may say more about Mike Bordick than anything.

BARRON'S TOUCH KEEPS TECH INVESTORS IN CHECK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cisco Systems got ``Barroned'' this week.
</P>
<P>
   Barron's, the financial newsweekly, ran a cover story on Cisco
last weekend, which argued that the stock of the high-tech giant
was way overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   The price of Cisco's stock fell Monday, and it fell again
Wednesday, even after the company reported spectacular earnings.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Internet companies got the Barron's treatment. A cover
story that ran March 20 predicted that many dot-com companies would
run out of cash in the coming months. About a week later the
auditors for drkoop.com, an online health company cited in the
Barron's story, reported that the firm might not have enough cash
to continue as a going concern. The news triggered a tumble in
Internet stocks that has yet to end.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Barron's article appeared, the Goldman Sachs Internet
index has dropped 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Has Barron's singlehandedly toppled the Nasdaq? Hardly. No one
has that kind of clout. But in a series of well-timed stories the
paper has poured cold water on the hopes and dreams of technology
investors.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when a whole new class of publications has sprung up
to worship the new economy the way teen magazines worship Britney
Spears, Barron's old-fashioned, skeptical tone has had an impact.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is happy about that. On the Cisco message board on
Raging Bull, a financial Web site, disgruntled investors this week
have been taking shots at Barron's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like the editor (of Barron's) wanted to buy some
Cisco at a bargain,'' wrote one angry investor. Added another, ``I
wouldn't get all worked up over Barron's. They are just a jealous
mag rag that missed the boat on the '90s by being bearish on the
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Barron's editor Ed Finn doesn't mind the attention, but he
rejects the bear label.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word I would use to characterize our philosophy is
contrarian,'' said Finn, in a telephone interview. ``We actually
run three or four positive stories for every negative one we do.
The negative ones tend to get noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   Barron's takes a classic value approach to the stock market. It
looks at the numbers and demands to see that they add up. That kind
of thinking has been out of favor of late and, in fact, an investor
who subscribed to the value doctrine would have missed out on the
Wall Street party the past few years. Barron's lead columnist, Alan
Abelson, has probably predicted the end of the bull market at least
100 times in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to technology stocks, the Barron's approach
has brought some much needed reality to a fantasy world. The
dot-com story said that at current rates of spending, many Internet
companies would burn through their money faster than most people
realized. It wasn't a brilliant observation, but the stark
presentation of the actual numbers got investors' attention.
</P>
<P>
   The Cisco piece was similarly straightforward. It pointed out
that the Cisco needs a sky-high stock price to afford all the
acquisitions it is making. It also noted that with a price/earnings
ratio of well over 100, Cisco will have to earn staggering profits
in future years to justify its stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Finn concedes that the timing of the recent pieces has been
fortuitous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is possible if we said some of these things earlier, no one
would have listened.'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barron's was somewhat premature in its criticism of Amazon.com.
Last May the publication ran a story called ``Amazon.bomb,'' which
highlighted the retailer's growing losses and its dim prospects for
ever making large profits. Amazon's stock price nearly doubled over
the next six months; it has since fallen precipitously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Amazon is trading lower today than it was when we
wrote the story,'' said Finn, with obvious pride. (He's right).
</P>
<P>
   Several money managers we spoke to were skeptical that Barron's
or any other publication really had much influence on stock prices.
``The fact is that tech stocks have been on a precarious perch for
the last six months,'' said Ned Riley, chief investment officer at
State Street Global Advisors. ``It wasn't going to take much of a
catalyst to make them change direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Moore, a portfolio manager with Jurika &AMP; Voyles in Oakland,
Calif., says that you can usually make a lot of money betting
against what the press says, especially when it comes to technology
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   That may be so. But as journalists and Barron's fans, we'd like
to think that clear writing and clear thinking helps investors cut
through the fog.
</P>
<P>
   Finn agrees. ``No one wants to hear bad news, but sometimes
delivering it is part of our job,'' he said.

VENTURE FIRMS LOOK FOR PROFITABILITY WHEN CHASING NET HOPEFULS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Did the dot-com dream really end? It sure seemed that way last
month, when once-hot Internet stocks plummeted and teary-eyed
executives begged for more cash.
</P>
<P>
   But if the recent turmoil has killed Internet aspirations, no
one told the Johansson cousins. The young founders of Inka.net
Inc., a Watertown, Mass. builder of online exchanges, are bustling
about, lining up deals _ but spending little time wooing investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still haven't had to make one investor call,'' crows
27-year-old Frans Johansson.
</P>
<P>
   Now that so many dot-com CEOs have been humbled, it's easy to
forget that cash-flush venture capital firms are still chasing
after fledgling technology firms, still looking for the next Akamai
Technologies Inc., Lycos Inc., or eBay Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by Internet investments, venture capital funding more
than tripled to $22.7 billion in the first quarter of 2000 from
just $6.2 billion in the year-earlier period, according to the
National Venture Capital Association in Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Today's financing tends to be more narrowly focused on
business-to-business Internet companies, including software and
service providers such as Inka.net. But even a few online retailers
_ considered Wednesday's news _ have received cash infusions.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Roxy.com, a Marlborough, Mass. online
retailer of consumer electronics, thumbed its nose at naysayers
when it announced it had raised $25 million. Amid market turmoil in
April, CornerHardware.com of San Francisco attracted $21 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this money is still in the venture capital firms, and
it needs to be spent,'' said Michael Troiano, president of Primix
Solutions Inc., one of Inka.net's partners. ``The difference is
that it's not easy money. Now, they're looking for good ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists say they're seeking companies that include
profitability in their business plans. They want at the helm
experienced managers whose visions include more than a
multibillion-dollar payout and a vacation house on Martha's
Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   George McCabe, one of Inka.net's initial investors, says too
many start-ups seem to be struggling to come up with ideas to match
their money-drenched dreams. As they excitedly discuss plans to
create e-business companies in already crowded industries, McCabe
rolls his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to be an also-ran,'' said McCabe, a partner
with Pilot Ventures in New York. ``That's something that is so
pervasive today.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet hopefuls might learn a few lessons from Inka.net. The
company's owners, Frans and Christian Johansson, started two
medical companies in the 1990s before saving up enough money to
enroll in Harvard Business School in the fall of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While they were studying, their entrepreneurial instincts took
over. Soon, in the school's cafeteria, their cramped apartment, and
classrooms, they were discussing ideas for an Internet services
firm. In January, the two dropped out of school to concentrate on
Inka.net.
</P>
<P>
   The name ``Inka'' comes from the Swedish word for the Inca,
South American Indians who amassed an empire in the 15th and 16th
centuries, building a vast network of roads linking their conquered
lands.
</P>
<P>
   The Johansson cousins, whose mothers are African-American and
fathers are Swedish, spent most of their childhoods in Sweden
before moving back to the United States. Like the Inca, they hope
to connect organizations across the Web through their own ``road''
system.
</P>
<P>
   The Johanssons got a break _ and ruffled a few feathers _ when
they swiped Roland Adolfsson, a star employee with the technology
consulting firm Primix Solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were obviously disturbed and upset,'' said Primix's
Troiano. ``But the more (Adolfsson) told us about it, the more
excited we got.''
</P>
<P>
   Primix placed Inka.net in its Internet ``hatchery,'' which gives
the Johanssons easy access to software systems integrators and
consulting services. Inka.net now shares Primix's offices in
Watertown but will leave the nest later this month for its own
offices in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Inka.net already has attracted $3 million in seed money from a
group of investors, including Pilot Ventures, Primix CEO Lennart
Mengwall, and Bill Hambrecht, chief executive of W.R. Hambrecht &AMP;
Co.
</P>
<P>
   The Johanssons say there is enough interest in their company
that they can afford to be choosy about which firms fund them in
their second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a list of the venture capital firms,'' said
27-year-old Christian Johansson. ``We already know who we want to
talk with.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors seem to like the fact that the company builds online
trading platforms for other Web sites rather than try to compete in
the already crowded field of Internet exchanges. So its success
does not directly hinge on the success of an online business.
</P>
<P>
   Inka.net is now building an exchange that will allow members of
the Association for International Businesses to buy and sell
translation services. The pop-up exchange will be included on the
virtual organization's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The company's customers also include the New England Translators
Association.
</P>
<P>
   But even start-ups with a lot of buzz and funding face enormous
challenges. An unfriendly market for technology stocks makes it
difficult for Internet start-ups to go public. Dozens of companies
_ from Playboy.com to local Internet researcher Gomez Advisors _
have either delayed or refrained from scheduling initial public
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   The tumultuous financial markets also are making it harder for
fledgling technology companies to hire talented workers, many of
whom are heading to more established companies for regular salaries
rather than cash-equity deals.
</P>
<P>
   And when there's a good idea, there are dozens of me-too
upstarts waiting for a few million dollars in funding so they can
jump in the same marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that (Inka.net's) plan is exposed to the world, everyone
is going to duplicate what they've done,'' said Martin DeBono, an
analyst with Gomez Advisors. ``They need to get it out there
faster.''

<P>
   Baseballs are flying out of major league parks at a record clip
and the usual conspiracy theories are being raised.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)The ball is juiced. Mark McGwire and friends are hitting
something that looks and feels more like a Titleist HP Eclipse than
an old-time hardball.(unitals) Today's ball is wound tighter than
Tom Coughlin. It's not made by Rawlings, it's made by Wham-O
(itals)_ the company that brought us those cool Super Balls of the
1960s. It's Flubber. Or Son of Flubber.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to stifle complaints from every pitching coach and
meatball artist hurling middle relief, baseball commissioner Bud
Selig and his lieutenant, Sandy Alderson, have commissioned a
scientific study to determine if today's baseballs conform to size,
weight, and impact standards established by Major League Baseball.
The study is being conducted by Professor Jim Sherwood of the
University of Massachusetts at Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hearing about the ball everywhere I go,'' says Selig.
``When people say, `What about the ball?' I want every bit of
empirical data we can find as to how the baseball is produced. Is
it different or not different? I think we ought to study
everything, but I'll be surprised if it's any different.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Dr. Sherwood, a professor of mechanical engineering.
Sherwood has a doctorate in aerospace engineering and was compiling
data on car-crash simulation before baseball commissioned him to do
some bat testing a few years ago. With Larry Fallon, a doctoral
candidate at UMass Lowell, Sherwood has been hired to dissect and
analyze the 2000 baseballs being manufactured at a Rawlings factory
in Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   Sherwood and Fallon work in a lab at the Baseball Research
Center at the university and operate one of the two bat-testing
machines in existence. Using calipers, scales, and tape measures,
they'll see if the baseballs conform to specifications.
</P>
<P>
   Don't bother sending them that foul ball you caught off the bat
of Denny Doyle in 1975. Sherwood says it's impossible to compare
today's baseballs with balls from prior seasons because performance
deteriorates as the balls age. Any ball made prior to 1999 is
probably useless for the sake of comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Sherwood says there is a specific range for the performance of a
baseball as spelled out in the rulebook. A major league ball
traveling at a speed of 100 miles per hour that hits a wall of
2-inch north white ashwood is supposed to bouce back at 57 miles
per hour. Presumably, a juiced ball will bounce back at a faster
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Big leaguers hit a record 931 home runs last month. They set
records for homers in a day (57) and a week (262). At the current
pace, major leaguers will hit 6,254 home runs this year, shattering
last year's record of 5,528. At the end of April, 22 players were
on pace to hit at least 48 homers. The record for most players with
48 or more homers in a season is five, achieved in 1996 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Conspiracy buffs note that fans love home runs and baseball
loves increased attendance and therefore, it is in the interest of
Major League Baseball to juice the ball and create more offensive
fireworks. This is the first year the ball has been stamped with a
facsimile of Selig's signature. Did the Comish order a livelier
baseball from the Costa Ricans?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not that smart,'' says Selig. ``But fans aren't
objecting. We're 5.8 percent ahead of last year's attendance and
unless something's out of hand, fans are enjoying this. And let me
ask you, is Pedro Martinez pitching with a different baseball? It's
only been one month. Too early to get hysterical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked with Ted Sizemore at Rawlings and he swears
there's nothing different. I think there are a lot of factors.
We've had two expansions in the '90s. Ballparks are smaller.
Hitters are clearly bigger and stronger. I'm a history buff and I
was recently watching old film of DiMaggio and Musial and I was
struck by how much bigger players are today.''
</P>
<P>
   When Selig talks about expansion he is saying what we all know:
There's too much bad pitching in the majors. Every roster has three
or four guys who are Triple A pitchers. Making matters worse is the
extinction of the high strike. If umpires would call strikes
between the belt and the letters (as the rule states), ERA's would
shrink and so would the hideous home run totals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the ball is the problem,'' says Alderson, a
Dartmouth grad (Harvard law school) who served as general manager
of the Oakland A's before joining the commissioner's office. ``The
ball is made exactly the way it was made 30 years ago, but people
seem to think these balls are made in Area 51.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today everything is oriented toward offense. Nine guys walk up
there looking for home runs. There's no anathema to striking out. I
watched Jose Canseco for a lot of years. I think he thinks of a
strikeout as sort of the flip side of a home run _ still
entertaining for fans.''
</P>
<P>
   In 30 ballparks across North America, the home runs will
continue to fly while two scientists search for the truth in their
baseball lab under a campus bookstore in Lowell, Massachusetts.

<P>
   NEWTON, Mass. _ Juliana Hatfield is dressed in black, electric
guitar slung low, performing for a rapt crowd. She's scratching out
pretty, messy chords and singing _ in the thin, sweet voice that
has become a signature of '90s indie-pop _ about love, drugs, and
hotels. It's a familiar image _ except for the neat rows of Doc
Martens on the wall behind her, and the boxed pairs of plastic pink
flamingos dangling over her head, and the sound system, which
consists of a speaker balanced on a giant, hand-shaped chair.
</P>
<P>
   While a typical musician's itinerary might include a 21-city
tour, Hatfield is on a 21-store tour. Beginning Wednesday, she hit
the road for a string of free concerts at every Newbury Comics
record store, playing three live performances a day over seven
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our 20-year history we have never attempted an undertaking
this outrageous and all-encompassing with any artist,'' said
Newbury Comics CEO Mike Dreese.
</P>
<P>
   The whirlwind New England tour leads up to Tuesday's release of
two new Juliana Hatfield CDs. ``Beautiful Creature'' is a low-key
collection of ballads and pop tunes and ``Total System Failure'' is
an aggressive rock album by Juliana's Pony, a collaboration with
drummer Zephan Courtney and Weezer bassist Mikey Welch. Her new
label, Zoe/Rounder, dreamed up ``Store Tour 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I must not have been thinking clearly, because I just said
yes,'' Hatfield confesses in the office of the Needham Street store
before the first mini-set of the day begins at 2.
</P>
<P>
   The simultaneous release of two wildly different albums is
unorthodox. Hatfield calls it self-indulgent. But it's also an
extraordinary artistic statement, a window thrown wide open on her
distinct musical voices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really just sort of happened. It wasn't planned,'' Hatfield
says. `` `Beautiful Creature' is really a bunch of demos that I'd
been working on for a period of nine months or so, with different
producers, different muscians. At the end of that, I just sort of
felt finished, and I thought that some of those songs might make a
cohesive album. And then I just had a lot of free time, so I came
up with this idea of doing a whole rock thing, really fast.''
</P>
<P>
   She says ``Total System Failure'' was motivated by the urge to
cut loose and have fun. But the result is brittle and disturbing.
``I'm only realizing this now,'' she says, ``but I think a lot of
it was inspired by Los Angeles,'' her home for seven months last
year. She wrote the songs soon after she returned to Boston, where
the Duxbury native began her career in the Blake Babies. ``This
attitude of disgust, and of being unforgiving, rubbed off on me in
that way. I mean, things don't really hit you until you're out of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   She shakes her head at the suggestion that it requires a good
bit of courage to put two versions of yourself up for public
consumption. ``It's not guts really. It's just freedom. There was
no one looking over my shoulder, critiquing me,'' she says,
referring to the fact that she wasn't signed to a label at the
time. ``So, they're just natural extensions of me.'' Zoe/Rounder
snapped up both projects after hearing them late last year.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-minute set in the shoe section draws mainly from
``Beautiful Creature,'' which for obvious reasons lends itself
better than the scathing rock songs to a solo performance. ``I'm
just gonna play a few, and you decide if you like them,'' Hatfield
says before laying into the delicate chords of ``Might Be in Love''
and ``Hotels,'' a langorous ode to her constant state of
restlessness. ``Slow Motion'' follows, a darkly quiet gem, and
``Choose Drugs,'' a deceptively titled song with a tragic refrain:
``I say it's me or drugs/You choose drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, she receives fans behind the makeup counter for a
quick autograph-signing session. Many tell her in hushed tones that
she's awesome. Some are quite speechless, staring and smiling as
Hatfield scrawls her name on their posters and T-shirts. One young
woman asks if she can snap a photo of her in a pink tiara she's
brought along. ``Kristin Hersh wore it!'' she tells Hatfield, who
obliges.

DATING BIG BIRD 
By Laura Zigman 
The Dial Press, 248 pp., $22.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Ellen Franck, delight, devotion, and despair are all wrapped
up in a Pickle.
</P>
<P>
   That's what she calls her little niece Nicole, whom she's adored
since the moment she saw her. Ellen lives in Manhattan and Nicole
in Maine, so each visit is an event. They spend all their time
together, eating the same food, sleeping in the same bed, waking up
beside each other. It is behavior, Laura Zigman writes in ``Dating
Big Bird,'' ``completely befitting two people in love.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a description that points to the two blots on Ellen's life.
Although she has plenty _ good health and good friends, a great job
in the fashion world and an apartment in the Village _ she has no
child to call her own, and no ready prospect of getting one.
</P>
<P>
   She's been seeing Malcolm, but in the six months since they met
in his writing class, it's been as though she's been chasing a dead
man. Malcolm's son died five years before, at age 7, of leukemia,
and ever since it has been his only important fact of life.
</P>
<P>
   She's run the gantlet and gamut of men: the ones who didn't
really matter, the one who broke her heart, the one she would have
married if not for his wife. Now there's Malcolm, whom she thinks,
or hopes, she can revive, although there's been no evidence of
thawing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she's feeling the gnawing of her deepest desire. It
practically provokes a crisis when, while walking in Manhattan, she
espies Amy Jacobs, Miss Everything of her graduating class at
Brookline High, pushing a stroller. It's only when Ellen learns
that the child isn't hers _ and that they share the baby burn _
that they become friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty soon, they've hatched a plan _ a nine-month plan _ to
become pregnant, one way or the other.
</P>
<P>
   For Ellen, the way is artificial. She decides, finally, that
Malcolm isn't going to be her answer, or rather, she suggests to
him that he could be, and it is an element in their breakup. So she
starts accumulating data on sperm donors, coparenting, things to
expect in early pregnancy, adoption, and the like. Month by month,
the piles of books and pamphlets grow, just as her belly would
have.
</P>
<P>
   Sly ironies like that _ and the one that she craves a Pickle,
even though she only wishes she were pregnant _ abound in ``Dating
Big Bird,'' the second novel by Zigman, who resides in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   She reserves most of her observations for the dating, predating,
and postdating lives, but Ellen's occupation as a flack for a New
York designer affords a platform for riffs on the fashion industry,
such as when she describes samples from the new fall line: ``They
were all black, gray (`the new black'), and brown (`the other new
black').'' She's troubled by a small voice inside spouting the
fashion heresy that ``they're just clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Big Bird, despite title billing, plays only a small role that is
most significant as ``an example of how carried away you can get
when you want a child as much as (Ellen) did.'' The ``Sesame
Street'' character's qualifications for fatherhood: He's warm,
affectionate, has a stable job, and you always know where to find
him. Ellen takes to going to sleep with him when Nicole, in a
touching act of pity, gives Ellen her Big Bird doll because she
doesn't have a ``hud-band.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Zigman keeps the pace lively and the tone frothy, one
polemical undertone is that men, as potential mates, are akin to
lice. Only two of the main characters are men, and they come with
baggage. Among the bit players, the men are timid asses, nebbishy,
or merely present. Only the kindly Indian doctor Ellen consults
about conceiving could be called admirable.
</P>
<P>
   The women aren't idealized _ one of Ellen's best friends is
convinced that every man is either ``wacko or fag'' _ but they do
cover a broader range.
</P>
<P>
   As befits the fashion setting, there are plenty of stars on the
periphery, but only Demi Moore enters the dialogue, and then only
briefly. Given Moore's famously public pregnancies, perhaps she'll
be interested in the lead role if this story comes to the screen.
Its pleasant, low-brow tenor suggests it would be a perfect fit for
film. After all the emotional turmoil of Ellen's quandary, there's
even an upbeat ending. Roll take.

&HT;     NEW YORK SENIORS TRY TO GET AROUND THE HIGH COST OF
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JAMES M. ODATO   
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Advocates for New York senior citizens plan to
begin organizing trips to Canada to help Medicare patients buy
cheaper medications.
</P>
<P>
   Two politically tinged trips bound for Montreal are planned for
early June by the New York Statewide Senior Action Council and
Democratic Rep. Louise Slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Between June and the end of the year, when expansion of the
state's prescription drug subsidy program kicks in, Statewide
Senior Action is trying to arrange shorter trips to a small
Indian-run pharmacy on the Canadian side of the St. Regis Mohawk
reservation.
</P>
<P>
   The June trips, organizers say, are aimed at highlighting the
high cost of prescription drugs in the U.S. Drugs sold in Canada
can be 40 to 50 percent cheaper than those in New York, said
Michael Burgess, executive director of Statewide Senior Action.
</P>
<P>
   Public Citizen, which is helping to organize the June trips,
intends to invite Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democrats' candidate
for a New York seat in the U.S. Senate, and the Republican
candidate, presumably New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. Clinton
proposes to abolish laws that prevent cross-border purchases of
drugs by U.S. pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   The bus excursions are planned at a time when state and national
elected officials are proposing ways to end pricing inequities in
the U.S. Some citizens arrange purchases from many nations,
particularly Mexico and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-led state senate this week scheduled a May 31
hearing in Albany on the drug cost issue. GOP State Sen. John
Marchi is pushing legislation that would prohibit drug companies
from selling prescription products in New York at prices above
those charged elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would create an interstate compact to deal with drug
costs and make it a felony to sell drugs at a higher price to
states in the compact.
</P>
<P>
   Burgess said he's contacted a Canadian pharmacy at the Mohawk
Reservation. But the seniors need a Canadian doctor's prescription
before buying at the Mohawk pharmacy, just like any other Canadian
pharmacy, said Gus Pike, pharmacist at the Mohawk store. He said he
needs to study whether he will take on the extra business.
</P>
<P>
   People on both sides of the border say the practice is not
widespread.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't happen too often,'' said Alain Vezina, a spokesman
for the Quebec health department, adding that Canadian doctors
discourage the practice.
</P>
<P>
   Vanessa Johnson, of the consumer watchdog group Public Citizen,
added that most U.S. citizens simply can't afford to go to Canada
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to change the law here to make it easier to get
prescriptions,'' she said.

AL GORE'S LIES _ ABOUT ME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As you have no doubt heard, Al Gore lies like a rug. The old
punch line about how you know when a politician is lying is no joke
when it comes to the vice president: If his lips are moving, you
know.
</P>
<P>
   His lies are effortless and imaginative. He created the
Internet. He and Tipper were the inspiration for ``Love Story.'' He
had no idea the Buddhist temple event was a fund-raiser. He
co-sponsored the McCain-Feingold campaign finance bill. He ``walked
through the elephant grass and was fired upon'' in Vietnam. He
``always, always, always'' supported Roe v. Wade. He ``got a bunch
of people indicted and sent to jail'' when he was a reporter at the
Nashville Tennesseean. His sister was ``the very first volunteer
for the Peace Corps.'' He ``found'' Love Canal. He authored the
earned income tax credit. He contributed to Hubert Humphrey's
acceptance speech at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. His
father, the late Senator Albert Gore Sr., was a brave civil rights
crusader.
</P>
<P>
   Hogwash, all of it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in fairness, not all of Gore's fabrications are bare-faced
lies. Sometimes they are merely shameless exaggerations.
</P>
<P>
   He did, for example, hold hearings on the pollution at Love
Canal _ two months after the state and federal governments declared
the town a disaster area. His TV ad boasting that he met with
Soviet ruler Mikhail Gorbachev wasn't completely false: He
(itals)had(unitals) once shaken Gorby's hand at a Capitol Hill
luncheon. And when he bragged in February that he'd just come from
``a huge event with 3,000 people'' at Ohio State University, he was
only off by a factor of 6. ``Officials at that rally said the room
. . . did not hold more than 1,200 people,'' The New York Times
reported, ``and, given the area needed for the staging . . . , they
estimated the crowd at 500.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore tortures the truth, it seems, about everything. So it was
only a matter of time until he tortured the truth about _ me.
</P>
<P>
   On April 26, the Gore campaign put out a press release titled
``George W. Bush: A History of Personal Attacks and Negative
Campaigning.'' It strung together excerpts from various articles,
editorials, and columns, the cumulative effect of which was to
suggest that Bush is waging the most destructive campaign seen in
America since Sherman marched through Georgia. And right in the
middle of that release were bits and pieces of a column your humble
correspondent wrote on March 9.
</P>
<P>
   Surely you remember. That was a column about Super Tuesday, and
it said _ well, let's just go to the Gore release, which quoted
from two paragraphs in that column, including this one:
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, the Texas governor deserved a smack for making his stand
at Bob Jones University. . . . And sure, it was fair to whack
McCain from the left, since he was wooing left-leaning voters _ but
to slam him as a foe of clean air? Or an enemy of women with breast
cancer?''
</P>
<P>
   My words, no doubt about it _ but something is missing. The very
next sentence, (itals)not(unitals) quoted by the Gore campaign,
said, ``At their worst, these two behaved like disciples of Al
Gore.'' How did Gore's people miss that? And how did they miss the
paragraph, much higher up, that remarked: ``If it isn't universally
obvious by now just how dishonest and ruthless the vice president
can be in the pursuit of power, it will be by November.'' For that
matter, how did they miss my declaration that on Super Tuesday, ``I
voted against Al Gore''? It was the column's second sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, it doesn't offend me to be quoted by the Gore
campaign. It does surprise me, though. I have it on good authority
that the vice president doesn't care for these little essays. I
have it on (itals)very(unitals) good authority: Gore told me so
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, arriving at The Boston Globe for an editorial
board interview, Gore walked around the room and shook hands with
each of the editors and writers present. When he reached me, he
started to shake my hand, too. But as soon as he heard my name, he
withdrew his hand _ then began peering intently at the top of my
head. This was a new experience. Never having had my scalp
scrutinized by a presidential candidate in front of two-dozen
people before, I wasn't quite sure of the protocol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are the horns?'' Gore asked.
</P>
<P>
   The horns?
</P>
<P>
   ``From the columns you've been writing about me, I expected to
see horns on your head.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, such sparkling wit. Such a deft touch with the press! And to
think that some people find Al Gore condescending and smug.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get the wrong impression. I don't mean to suggest that
everything Gore or his campaign staff says is false or contrived.
Sometimes there is no question that they are speaking from the
heart.
</P>
<P>
   In March, for instance, Roger Simon of US News asked ``a Gore
adviser'' to describe ``the general tenor of the campaign'' being
planned against Bush. We're going to call Bush ``a far-right-wing
lunatic,'' Gore's man answered, and the campaign we run ``is going
to be brutal, incredibly negative, nasty, dirty, slimy, sleazy, and
one of the worst in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Now (itals)that(unitals) has the ring of truth.

CAREERPATH'S WRONG TURN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somewhere along the way, I've acquired a reputation as a soft
touch. The word has gone forth to a host of embattled Internet
companies: Let's get that guy in Boston to write nice things about
us. That'll do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose that's why I got a call Wednesday from CareerPath.com,
a California job-hunting Web site that's facing a likely lawsuit
from Monster.com. It's another of those intellectual property cases
that'll continue to roil the Internet until nobody owns his own
name any more.
</P>
<P>
   I've written about such cases from time to time, and I've tended
to favor the free flow of online data _ just the attitude that
CareerPath is hoping for. Besides, The New York Times Co., owner of
The Boston Globe, is an investor in CareerPath, and while such
grubby concerns aren't supposed to motivate an honest journalist,
one can always hope.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the deal. CareerPath offers a service called Resume Scout
that lets an employer check out multiple Internet resume listings
with a single search. Need to hire an expert in Visual Basic
programming to fend off the Love Bug virus? Type in ``visual
basic'' and you'll get lots of relevant resumes.
</P>
<P>
   CareerPath doesn't just search the various free resume services
on the Web. The service also works on commercial job-search sites
such as Monster.com. A company can pay $9,400 a year for access to
the Monster resume database. But if the Monster subscriber pays an
additional $200 a month to CareerPath, he can search the Monster
listings and dozens of others, all at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Good for CareerPath and its customers, perhaps. But the people
at Monster are furious. They never gave permission for their
resumes to be listed by CareerPath, and they don't receive a dime
of compensation. Monster's lawyers have fired off a
cease-and-desist letter, demanding that CareerPath cut it out.
CareerPath vows to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we're actually helping Monster,'' says Rob Feinstein,
CareerPath's vice president of marketing. ``We're making it easier
for recruiters to utilize their multiple subscriptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein notes that his service will only provide Monster.com
resumes to users who've paid their Monster membership fee, so
they're not stealing any business. What right does Monster have to
complain?
</P>
<P>
   CareerPath compares its plight to that of Bidder's Edge. This
outfit is being sued by Internet auction house eBay, because
Bidder's Edge runs a Web site that lists auction information from
eBay, without eBay's permission. A federal judge has publicly
hinted that he's going to rule in favor of eBay, but he hasn't made
it official yet.
</P>
<P>
   He never should. I believe Bidder's Edge has every right to do
what it's doing, for two reasons. First, Bidder's Edge doesn't
charge a penny for its service, so it's not directly piggybacking
on eBay's hard work.
</P>
<P>
   Second and more important, Bidder's Edge is merely displaying
publicly available Internet data. eBay publishes its auction
listings right on the Web for all to see. Such openly published
Internet files are routinely indexed by all kinds of search
engines, which are vital to the smooth functioning of the Web. If
sites can demand payment from search services that list them, the
Web will become even more unmanageable than it is today.
</P>
<P>
   The CareerPath case is different. Monster.com's resume list is a
private database, stored on a password-protected server. The
company is surely entitled to set limits on its use, just as this
newspaper can decide who gets to reprint its articles.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, CareerPath charges $200 a month, or $2,400 a year.
Those CareerPath customers who also subscribe to Monster.com may
well have joined so they can use CareerPath's handy search feature.
Some part of the $2,400 fee is due to the availability of
Monster.com listings. These customers might want to pay less, or
might not subscribe at all, if they couldn't get access to the
Monster.com resumes. That means CareerPath is deriving some of its
revenue by tapping unbidden into someone else's database.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, guys. This won't do. CareerPath's Resume Scout is a great
idea, but it's one that piggybacks on somebody else's great idea.
And it doesn't suddenly become all right, just because it's
happening on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   CareerPath should either drop Monster from its service, or drag
out its checkbook and start paying royalties. No doubt this isn't
what the folks at CareerPath were hoping to read over their morning
corn flakes. But I can't have people thinking I've gone soft.

BRINGING OUT THE WEIRD
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: x stars 
By ROB LOWMAN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes it's hard to see past director Martin Scorsese's
``Raging Bull''/``Mean Streets'' image. But the New York City
filmmaker's more offbeat works, like ``After Hours'' and ``King of
Comedy,'' are interesting in ways his acknowledged masterpieces
like ``Goodfellas'' and ``Taxi Driver'' or his forays into the
religion realm _ ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' and ``Kundun'' _
aren't.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's because the few times Scorsese sheds his serious
visage, he demonstrates a sense of humor. The Farrelly brothers
(``Dumb and Dumber'') don't have to worry, though; Scorsese's idea
of humor plays off the extreme intensity of his characters. (Come
to think of it, Travis Bickle's ``You talkin' to me?'' rant in
``Taxi Driver'' is pretty funny _ in a perverse way.) The
difference, though, is that in ``After Hours'' and Scorsese's
latest, ``Bringing Out the Dead,'' the characters are not as likely
to pull out a gun and blow someone's head off. Nevertheless, what
you get are not belly laughs but uneasy chuckles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dead,'' which hits video stores this week, is a hyperkinetic
story of ambulance driver/medic Frank Pierce (Nicolas Cage) who
works the night shift in New York City. Haunted by the ghost of a
young girl he was unable to save and trapped in his job (he can't
even get himself fired, though he repeatedly tries), he careens
through a surreal world of sirens, lights and the dead or dying,
unable to connect with anything around him, including a series of
eccentric partners played by Ving Rhames, John Goodman and Tom
Sizemore.
</P>
<P>
   Like the hapless computer programmer in ``After Hours,'' the
numbed- out Pierce's fate is randomly determined by a series of
bizarre events (or emergency calls) until he meets Mary Burke
(Patricia Arquette), whose father has suffered an apparent fatal
heart attack. Pierce suggests putting on a piece of his favored
music (Sinatra, as it turns out) to bring him back. It works, but
he's essentially a vegetable. Mary, a former junkie who's trying to
pull her life together, has trouble handling having her father in
this state, and Pierce, who's attracted to her, is conflicted over
what is the right thing to do about it.
</P>
<P>
   As dark as this all may sound, ``Dead's'' loopy gallows humor
keeps it afloat at times. Frank is affiliated with a hospital
called Our Lady of Perpetual Mercy, and inside there's a statue of
her with a neon halo. At one point, Marcus (Rhames) performs a
raising-of-the-dead ceremony on a drug-overdose victim while his
spaced-out friends gawk.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Dead'' may not be great Scorsese _ it goes down too many
dead-end avenues (pun intended) _ you can have fun along the way.
</P>
<P>
   !folo!A John Deere letter: Some people may find ``The Straight
Story'' hokey; others, heartwarming. Based on the story of
73-year-old Alvin Straight, who sets off to visit his ailing and
estranged brother, traveling more than 300 miles from Iowa to
Wisconsin aboard his lawn mower, the film is directed by _ of all
people _ David Lynch (``Blue Velvet'').
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Straight (beautifully played by Oscar nominee
Richard Farnsworth) dispenses simple gems of wisdom to folks he
encounters. To the cynical, it will seem banal. But my suggestion
is to suspend your cynicism; the trip is better than you might
think.
</P>
<P>
   _____ &QL; 
``Bringing Out the Dead'' (Paramount) is priced for rental; sale
price on VHS is $106.99. The DVD is priced at $29.99 and includes a
making of documentary with interviews of the cast and crew. ``The

STUDENT SAYS HE MAY HAVE ACCIDENTALLY RELEASED COMPUTER VIRUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines _ Appearing nervous behind a pair of dark
glasses, a young computer student told reporters Thursday that ``it
is possible'' that he released a destructive virus that has
crippled computer programs around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The student, Onel de Guzman, 23, did not quite admit that he
created the ``I love you'' virus that recently spread rapidly
through e-mail systems in at least 20 countries.
</P>
<P>
   But when he was asked whether he might have accidentally
released the virus, he replied, ``It is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   De Guzman, who lives in an apartment that has been identified by
officials as the source of the virus, was being sought by
authorities, although they have not officially named him as a
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion focused on him when it was learned that he had
submitted a thesis proposal to his computer college in February
that contained information similar to that used to create the
virus.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Thursday how he felt about the damage caused by the virus,
de Guzman said, ``Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he was not an Internet fanatic and that he and his
friends had only been trying to create what he called ``a gimmick''
_ a term used among young people here for an event that is exciting
and fun.
</P>
<P>
   Standing beside him, his lawyer, Rolando Quimbo, said, ``He is
not really aware that the act imputed to him was done by him.''
</P>
<P>
   These comments reinforced a growing sense here that one of the
most virulent computer viruses ever known was not a premeditated
act of sabotage but could have been a prank that later raced out of
control.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at AMA Computer College, where de Guzman is a student,
said Wednesday that they believed that he might have intended to
steal passwords and Internet access rather than cause tens of
millions of dollars of damage to computer systems around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The lead investigator at the National Bureau of Investigation,
the top law enforcement agency in the Philippines, Nelson
Bartolome, said Thursday that the creators of the virus ``did not
know it was criminal. Perhaps it was just a prank.''
</P>
<P>
   If this is so, one analyst here said, the episode illustrates
the vulnerability of computer systems not only to sophisticated
vandals but to relatively crude and even unintended acts of
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you need very, very sophisticated programming
language to create viruses, in the same way that you don't need
very, very sophisticated weapons to wreak havoc on a society,''
said Randy David, a Filipino sociologist who has studied the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   De Guzman's thesis proposal, which was rejected by his college
because of its criminal implications, described a plan to ``steal
and retrieve Internet accounts of the victim's computer'' in order
to gain free access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the things the virus did, while also moving
through e-mail systems like a poisoned chain letter, paralyzing the
accounts of recipients who opened an attachment titled ``I love
you.''
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference Thursday, de Guzman said that Internet
access should be free and that it was ``immoral'' for companies to
charge for its use.

&HT;     SAFEWAY DEFEATS GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS RESOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JANE KAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The fight over genetically engineered foods
spread to Safeway as shareholders defeated a resolution that would
have removed the products from the chain's stores nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   With most of the votes counted Tuesday, the stockholders were
heeding the corporation's arguments: Barring modified foods was
``impracticable ... and could put Safeway at a competitive
disadvantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The failed dissident shareholder resolution said by selling
unpopular genetically engineered foods, Safeway wasn't making more
money than it otherwise would on traditional products. Yet, because
of uncertainties regarding safety, it was taking on unnecessary
liability.
</P>
<P>
   Safeway is just one of nearly two dozen companies that have
faced this kind of resolution over the past year, filed by New
York's Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, a coalition
of 300 so-called ``socially responsible'' investment firms and
religious institutional investors. And the coalition has no
intention of quitting, said coalition activists.
</P>
<P>
   Some other companies targeted with resolutions have been Coca
Cola, PepsiCo, American Home Products, Archer Daniels Midland,
Kellogg, McDonald's, Campbell's Soup, General Mills, Kroger, Kraft
Foods, Procter &AMP; Gamble, Quaker Oats, Sara Lee and Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over genetically engineered foods has drawn more
shareholder participation than any other topic in the history of
organizing over corporate responsibility. That includes ending
apartheid in South Africa, said Conrad MacKerron, director of
corporate accountability for As You Sow, a San Francisco nonprofit
and part of the national coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went from zero to about 23 different companies facing
action just in one year,'' said MacKerron.
</P>
<P>
   After the Safeway vote, Susan Vickers, a member of Sisters of
Notre Dame de Namur in Belmont, Calif., which owns stock in Safeway
and supports the resolution, said: ``Obviously, there needs to be
more education on the part of consumers and corporate management.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly will not cease our efforts,'' Vickers said.
``It's a real health and safety issue for human beings around the
globe and for our planet. We have to pay attention to a more
rigorous study of what are the longterm impacts.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution called for Safeway to stop buying any new foods
made of altered crops _ corn, soybeans, canola or potatoes, which
form the basis of many cereals, oils, cookies, soy baby formulas,
soft drinks and corn snacks. It would have required labeling while
Safeway phased out the products.
</P>
<P>
   The food presents risk because toxins that act as insecticides
build up in some altered crops, the resolution said. In addition,
it said, engineered corn pollen may harm Monarch butterflies and
some new plants may contain allergens.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Steven A. Burd, Safeway CEO, president and
chairman, said the U.S. government and other prestigious groups
generally endorse the use of genetic modification and food
biotechnology and ``stand firmly behind their safety.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the corporation said Safeway would have serious
difficulty determining what constitutes an altered product, and
labeling would place the products at a competitive disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's vote count was a disappointment to the organizers. It
was 2.3 percent in favor of the resolution, according to Safeway
officials. The final results will be available.
</P>
<P>
   If the vote falls short of 3 percent, shareholders can't propose
a similar resolution next year, according to Securities and
Exchange Commission rules.
</P>
<P>
   Percentages are important because they attract the attention of
the corporations, which is the point of it all, said Michael
Passoff of As You Sow.

That's news also to mainstream Democrats, who want to use the

<P>
   Simpson, who was acquitted of murder but found liable for the
deaths in a civil trial, claims the phone records will prove his
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Simpson's Heisman Trophy and 80 other items were sold
at auction for $430,000. The money was used to pay some of the
$33.5 million civil judgment owed by Simpson to Nicole Brown
Simpson's estate and to Ron Goldman's parents.

NEWS FROM SIERRA LEONE SCARS THE IMAGINATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the atrocities committed by the butchers who rampage in
Sierra Leone under the rubric of the Revolutionary United Front,
none are more appalling than the amputations and mutilations.
</P>
<P>
   Not just arms and hands, but legs, ears and other body parts
brutally severed with axes and machetes.
</P>
<P>
   Such cruelty would violate the rules of war, even it were only
combatants who were being subjected to it. But in this case it is
civilians _ men, women and especially children who, during the nine
years of the internecine bloodletting that is the Sierra Leone
civil war, are bearing the brunt of the gruesome maiming.
</P>
<P>
   Picture a small girl with dazed, uncomprehending eyes and stumps
above her elbows. That's the poster child for the RUF.
</P>
<P>
   The maiming is believed to be a key part of the RUF's campaign
to terrorize the population and make the people eager for peace at
any price. It is the same practice that was used by the Belgians in
colonizing the Congo.
</P>
<P>
   But despite all the revulsion that the amputations elicit, they
are only the peak of the malevolence unleashed on hapless civilians
of that small part of the world where Cinque grew up, was sold into
slavery and returned to after a protracted legal battle in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Cinque, you may remember, was the leader of the 1839 Amistad
mutiny. They made a movie about that a few years ago. He was a
member of the Mende tribe, and the Mendes constitute about 30
percent of the population of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   The Mendes are fighting on the government side of this madness,
which is not entirely to their credit, but it is far better than
killing, maiming, torturing and raping with the RUF.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the accounts of the RUF's mass killings, gang rapes of
women and prepubescent girls, abductions and torture contained in a
report on the situation in Sierra Leone issued by Human Rights
Watch defy belief.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most chilling revelations is that much of this
brutality is being meted out by children, boys as young as 10 or 12
who have been abducted, given military training, drugged and forced
to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Children killing and maiming other children. Children beating
and shooting people old enough to be their grandparents. Children
deprived of the opportunity to develop a sense of right and wrong
or any appreciation of the value of life. Children used as cannon
fodder for their brutal commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those interviewed by Human Rights Watch described the
young boys among the rebels as some of the most vicious killers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the greater atrocities have been committed by the
rebels, the government forces have not been blameless. They, too,
have been guilty of on-the-spot executions of captured rebels and
collateral killings of civilians, who often have been used as human
shields. So have the Nigerian-led peacekeeping forces of the
Economic Community of West African States, a.k.a. ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the RUF, which attracted support in 1991 by promising
to rid the country of the corrupt and venal government in the
capital of Freetown, that has turned into the people's worst enemy.
</P>
<P>
   The autocratic government was corrupt, concerned more about
enriching itself off of Sierra Leone's minerals, primarily
diamonds, with little care for the people. But the RUF, led by
former army Cpl. Foday Sankoh and Gen. Sam Bockarie, has never
offered any real change for the people. They are backed and
supplied by the leaders of Liberia, Burkina Faso and Libya who are
paid in diamonds by the rebels and who covet Sierra Leone's diamond
mines.
</P>
<P>
   Mercenaries from those countries and even Ukraine are said to be
involved in the fighting on the rebel side.
</P>
<P>
   The whole nightmare in which so many have suffered, lost limbs
and died is just about greed. It is as simple as that. Sierra Leone
has the mineral resources to be a prosperous country. But because
of the greed of a few on both sides of the war, it is the world's
poorest.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the shaky cease-fire cobbled together last year has
come apart, another orgy of death, destruction and mayhem is
beginning. Only the insertion by the international community of
enough forces to overwhelm the RUF can stop the barbarity.
</P>
<P>
   But that appears unlikely because the Western powers no longer
see that they have any vital interests in places like Sierra Leone
now that the Cold War has ended. It would be next to impossible to
convince the American public that there is any reason to put the
lives of American troops at risk in such a place, although
humanitarian concern should be sufficient.

`TRAFFIC' COUNTERS FAMILIARITY OF ITS STORY LINE BY BEING FUN TO
WATCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Human Traffic'' introduces its main characters as if they were
power chords, slamming their names up on the screen in big, bold
fonts before each tells us a little about himself or herself.
They're all frustrated _ by their jobs, by their sex lives _ and,
to paraphrase the Easybeats, they've got Friday on their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it is Friday, and Jip, Lulu, Koop, Nina and Moff are
gearing up for a tension-releasing lost weekend on the rave scene
in Cardiff, Wales. Each has a problem that will be worked out, at
least in part, by the film's end, sometimes with their friends'
help. Their woes aren't anything new, but rookie feature director
Justin Kerrigan _ a 25-year-old vet of the rave scene himself _
films them with freshness and almost exhaustive energy.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan kicks out the jams here, throwing in fantasy sequences
and hallucinatory moments as his heroes drink, dance and drug their
way through Friday and Saturday before hitting the Sunday-afternoon
comedown, complete with amusingly uncomfortable moments with their
parents. The whole movie seems pumped and _ unlike its American
counterpart, the upcoming ``Groove'' _ counters the familiarity of
its story line simply by being fun to watch. The blasts of
electronica music might offend sensitive ears, and the lives of the
proletarian characters aren't steeped in a lot of depth, but with
this ``Traffic'' traveling at 90 mph, it's hard to care about any
bumps in the road.

HBO'S DRUG SERIES HITS HOME FOR FAMILY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A nasty 2-inch scar snakes down Kelly's right cheek, the work of
a woman wielding a butcher knife that would have taken an eye had
she not seen it coming. The woman was too high and too desperate
and too strong to stop, and, besides, Kelly (not her real name) was
merely trying to save them both.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after her mother attacked her in their living room,
knocking her over a couch and a table, through a door and a window,
specks of Kelly's blood are still in the carpet they can't afford
to replace, a daily reminder of what was and what can be.
</P>
<P>
   Two drug rehabs have made Kelly's mother a different woman, they
both acknowledge with bowed, nodding heads, and, who knows, perhaps
they believe it. Drug addiction is a disease that ravages the body
and the mind and the soul and leaves little to rehab anyhow.
</P>
<P>
   So the woman who bore the child now bears the burden of having
tried to sell her flesh and blood for the instant gratification of
the drug life that was really no life at all.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly and her mother are in the living room, in the dark, on the
couch, watching a tape of an HBO series about the drug life Kelly
knows firsthand. She'd called days earlier wondering about the
series, wondering if it was her life.
</P>
<P>
   About 45 minutes into the first hour of the show, she begins to
sob lightly, reminded in painful detail what drugs can do to a
family.
</P>
<P>
   HBO's ``The Corner,'' which ends its five-Sunday run May 21, was
said to be too real and too painful and too depressing for
audiences, and perhaps that's so. Praised by most who have seen it,
the series is unflinching in its depiction of drug users as
everyday folk who simply got caught up in the life and couldn't get
out. It has failed to capture the ``wow'' factor of another HBO
offering, the mob series ``The Sopranos,'' even though its nuance
is just as sharp, its characterizations just as unsettlingly real.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, for one, can't get enough of the series. She relates
heavily to the teen-age character in the series, a young man living
in a world of contradictions, a victim of his parents' misdirection
into the drug life.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Kelly, her older sister, mother and father lived
in a comfortable three-bedroom home in east Fort Worth, taking
walks and bike rides to a park on Saturdays, attending church on
Sundays, making sure each evening dinner was one they ate together.
No phone, no company, no TV. All that changed when her sister
drowned while away at a summer camp. Mother and father, strained
and pained, fought constantly and drank incessantly. Dad left, Mom
headed back to work, and Kelly found herself growing up fast.
</P>
<P>
   Life was hard, and it took its toll. Kelly remembers hearing the
nervous voice of her mother discussing by phone which corners to
cut to make the mortgage. But there were never enough corners. They
ended up in this small two-bedroom apartment in a world where
Kelly, now 18, must look into the worried eyes of men and women
with no place to go, nothing to do, little to say. This is, Kelly
says, ``my corner.''
</P>
<P>
   When home from her retail job at a shopping mall, she spends
most of her time looking out her window, watching people crisscross
the streets, selling drugs, drinking liquor, getting into
never-ending arguments and fistfights. She hears the beeping of a
forklift moving pallets of donated food, the bouncing of a
basketball on the hard concrete, and, sometimes, the clatter of a
police helicopter overhead. All the while, she dreams.
</P>
<P>
   For Kelly's mother, who quit her job as a nurse's aide and is
now on welfare, alcohol numbed the pain, and drugs numbed her life.
She remembers coming home in the middle of the night tearing apart
the house in search of drug cash. Kelly's scar came that night as
she refused, this time, to get out of the way and let things be.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Kelly has been sharing her bedroom with 10-year-old
twin cousins whose mother is now in rehab, their father locked away
in prison. Kelly is proud that they talked the cousin into getting
help and that her sons will be safe.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging on the wall above her bed is a poster of the cast from
``Beverly Hills, 90210,'' which is surrounded by a sea of posters
and pictures of hip-hop stars and a small one of Malcolm X.
</P>
<P>
   She wants to know if ``The Corner'' has a poster, and she's told
it does. She looks at the ``Beverly Hills, 90210'' poster and
slowly removes it.
</P>
<P>
   Watching from the doorway is her mother, who nods, and smiles,
her eyes swelling like a dam about to burst.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'll be OK if I'm OK,'' she says. ``She'll be OK if I'm
OK.''

<P>
   To like or not to like the new movie ``Hamlet''?
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers don't let you answer that question easily. There
are a lot of clever ideas in this New York update of Shakespeare's
classic tragedy, but just as many of them are simply strained
attempts to play out the concept. The verse sounds good coming out
of uniformly contemporary, American mouths, yet few of the
performances crackle or connect. The thing is self-consciously
cinematic to such a degree that no one's going to accuse it of
being a filmed play; but then, Laurence Olivier's simpler, noirish
1948 production was every bit a movie, and without having to call
attention to the fact every two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   So, yes? No? Up? Down?
</P>
<P>
   I just can't make up my mind.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Hamlet is a wild-haired, stubble-chinned,
film-student slacker played by _ who else? _ Ethan Hawke. His
uncle, Claudius (Kyle MacLachlan), and mother, Gertrude (Diane
Venora), now run his dead father's Denmark Corporation, a big
multinational something-or-other with vast media interests.
</P>
<P>
   It's doubtful, however, that Denmark's media interests surpass
those of adapter-director Michael Almereyda, who gets some kind of
extra-textual video footage or electronic gadget into just about
every scene.
</P>
<P>
   This is pretty good stuff, for a while.
</P>
<P>
   The Ghost (Sam Shepard, who quite chillingly emphasizes the
demanding father aspect over the supernatural take) first
materializes through a high-rise security camera. Hamlet, who
spends days going over wild tape footage while nursing his
indecision, splices together an accusatory short film in place of
the famous play-within-the-play. Polonius (Bill Murray, of all
people, giving the movie's best performance, a deft high-wire walk
between the buffoonish and concerned parent interpretations of the
role) wires Ophelia (Julia Stiles, pouty throughout) for the big
betrayal scene.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, Hamlet recites the soliloquy while trudging up the
``Action'' aisle at a Blockbuster store. But whether or not this
monotonous kid decides to take up arms remains academic, since
Hawke's performance isn't exactly the soul of wit. He gives the
role an apt youthful inertia, but it's the kind of right artistic
strategy that really doesn't come off well in practice.
</P>
<P>
   You'll probably wish this 21st-century Hamlet will make his
moves sooner than most previous incarnations, if only to cut short
the droning. &QL;

<P>
   ``Battlefield Earth'' is a movie that's so bad on so many
different levels that ... dare we say ... it's almost entertaining.
This isn't just stupid-bad like ``Wild Wild West'' or ``Inspector
Gadget.'' This is ``Showgirls'' bad, the kind of unintentionally
camp movie that will play for years to come as an example of
Hollywood filmmaking at its most fatuous.
</P>
<P>
   Don't misunderstand. Buy a ticket for this mess, and you'll be
sorry. ``Battlefield Earth'' is a shrill, hollow and unintelligible
movie with no redeeming value whatsoever aside from watching John
Travolta ham it up as an evil alien who looks like a Rastafarian
Michelin Man with Klingon colorings. (Dig the KISS platform boots,
too, John.)
</P>
<P>
   Travolta's career will survive this catastrophe. The same can't
be said for director Roger Christian, a George Lucas collaborator,
who, judging from all the tilted camera angles, watched one too
many episodes of the old ``Batman'' television series before
undertaking this project. Not only that, but Christian botches
nearly every action sequence in the movie, rendering each set piece
dull, incoherent and pointless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Battlefield Earth,'' for the uninitiated, is based on L. Ron
Hubbard's mammoth science-fiction potboiler about a group of brave,
beleaguered human outcasts who dare to take on their towering alien
overlords, the dreadlocked Psychlos. The action takes place in A.D.
3000, centuries after the Psychlos conquered the planet (apparently
it took all of nine minutes) and, now they're just hanging around
to strip mine all the minerals. (Why such an advanced alien race
would place a high value on gold is one of a myriad of questions
best left unasked.)
</P>
<P>
   Most of the action takes place at the Psychlos' headquarters
where the head of security, Terl (Travolta), plots to exploit the
humans so he can acquire a stash of gold and beat a path back to
his home planet. Terl, however, doesn't count on the
resourcefulness of Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper), who learns
of the Psychlo ways through a knowledge zapper (again, don't ask)
and begins to apply Euclidean geometry to the task of overthrowing
his tormentors.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's stupidity is on such a grand scale that there simply
isn't enough space to list all the asinine moments. But permit me
to name a few: Terl randomly handing Jonnie Goodboy a book in
Denver's public library (looking pretty good after 1,000 years of
neglect), challenging him to find something in it that will help
him win his freedom. Jonnie Goodboy blows the dust off the book and
it's ... the Declaration of Independence!
</P>
<P>
   There's also the time when the film's lone human female
(Travolta's wife, Kelly Preston, has a cameo as a Psychlo with an
immense tongue) tells Jonnie Goodboy: ``I really don't believe in
fate. But I always knew this was your destiny.'' And, yes, she was
quivering in her buckskin costume when she said this.
</P>
<P>
   Travolta shamelessly throws himself into Terl, and, actually, is
intentionally quite funny in several scenes, usually the ones
involving his conviction that humans love to eat rats. Typically,
however, his broad performance suggests a certain fondness for
``Austin Powers''' Dr. Evil, and the filmmakers clearly missed a
golden opportunity to create a Mini-Terl sidekick. (The thankless
henchman role, instead, went to Forest Whitaker, who should fire
his agent.)
</P>
<P>
   Coming as it does from Hubbard, some have suggested
``Battlefield Earth'' could be a subliminal recruiting tool for the
author's Scientology sect. But if the filmmakers couldn't get the
obvious storytelling bits right, they'd be sorely challenged to
deliver a convincing subtext. If a sequel, as rumored, is planned,
perhaps we can request some subliminal snack-bar messages.
Beleaguered humans deserve a break, too.
</P>
<P>
   Hold the rat, though.

   ``Bossa Nova'' is a soundtrack in search of a movie. Brazilian
director Bruno Barreto's wispy valentine to Rio de Janeiro
percolates to the sultry and subtle rhythms of Antonio Carlos
Jobim's bossa nova music, but apart from the songs and the scenery,
there just isn't much here to hold your interest.
</P>
<P>
   Barreto, working from a screenplay by Alexandre Machado and
Fernanda Young, aims to capture the same kind of beautiful
melancholia that was a hallmark of Jobim's music. (Think
``Getz/Gilberto,'' particularly ``Corcovado.'') And there are
moments when the movie captures a certain ethereal magic, only to
have it dissolve through the story's rather earthbound plot
machinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bossa Nova'' allows us glimpses of the wounded hearts of
several Rio residents. Chief among them are an expatriate American,
Mary Ann (Amy Irving, Barreto's wife), who hasn't recovered from
her husband's drowning death, and Pedro Paulo (Antonio Fagundes), a
suave attorney still hurting from his wife's infidelities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bossa Nova'' intertwines their cautious romance with other
storylines. Mary Ann, an English teacher, schools a Brazilian
soccer star (Alexandre Borges), although he's more interested in
learning the language of love. A beautiful intern in Pedro's
office, Sharon (Giovanna Antonelli), captivates Pedro's mopey
half-brother (Pedro Cardoso). Pedro's father (Alberto de Mendoza),
an expert tailor, frets about losing his lifelong business in a
nasty divorce. Mary Ann's friend, Nadine (Drica Morales), conducts
a romance over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   These stories intersect in a frenetic finale that's unconvincing
because the movie has never invested much time in explaining its
characters. Barreto blithely assumes that Jobim's music and Pascal
Rabaud's gorgeous cinematography of a postcard-perfect Rio will be
enough to make you overlook the story's deficiencies. But the mood
simply isn't that intoxicating, and, left sober, the viewer is
clear-headed enough to mull over the movie, warts and all.
</P>
<P>
   The soundtrack, however, is an excellent investment. &QL;

THE BATTLE FOR `EARTH'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Travolta swears that his new movie, ``Battlefield Earth,''
has absolutely nothing to do with Scientology. Now, whether his
right hand was resting on a stack of L. Ron Hubbard's ``Dianetics''
when he said this is another matter entirely, but you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   A 25-year member of the sect, Travolta is one of Hollywood's
most outspoken Scientology advocates, but he's a little sensitive
that his new movie, based on a sci-fi pulp novel written by
Scientology founder Hubbard, is being seen by some as an
advertisement for the religious group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about popcorn and entertainment,'' says Travolta, who has
been on a 15-city tour to promote the film which he co-produced.
``(Hubbard) is as famous for his work as a fiction writer as he is
for his work as a philosopher, and I hope people realize that. This
film is not about Scientology.''
</P>
<P>
   Others aren't seeing it that way. Anti-Scientology organizations
like FactNet and the Lisa McPherson Trust have been fervently
working overtime in the past few months on the Internet, alleging,
among other things that the ``Battlefield Earth'' movie contains
subliminal messages and that proceeds from the movie's merchandise
will go directly to the Scientology church.
</P>
<P>
   Formally established in 1954 by Hubbard, Scientology has faced
government as private lawsuits, charging fraud, tax evasion,
financial mismanagement, and conspiring to steal government
documents. On the other hand the church has claimed it was being
persecuted by government agencies and by established medical
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The religious dispute about the film has been the talk of
cyberspace, but not exactly Hollywood, where people are more
focused on why Travolta would jeopardize his career by making this
movie in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Battlefield Earth'' has been plagued by bad buzz. The Wall
Street Journal termed anticipation for the film decidedly
``earthbound,'' and the movie's distributor, Warner Bros., has kept
it fairly well hidden from the media until a few days before its
opening. (Disney, by comparison, just screened nearly its entire
summer slate for the press.)
</P>
<P>
   ```Battlefield Earth' has the stench of death,'' says one
Hollywood producer, who happens to have a film opening this summer
as well. ``It should never have been made. It's an $80 million
vanity project for Travolta.''
</P>
<P>
   Travolta naturally disputes that point, calling Hubbard's book
``the fine wine of the genre.'' And his longtime manager, producer
Jonathan Krane, says that ``Battlefield Earth'' came in at $52
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they're thinking $80 million Canadian,'' Krane says. The
film, which was independently financed (``without a dollar coming
from the Scientologists,'' Krane says), was shot in Montreal to
reduce costs. Travolta also reportedly cut his usual $20 million
price tag by a third.
</P>
<P>
   Travolta became interested in making a movie of ``Battlefield
Earth'' in 1982, when Hubbard passed along an autographed copy of
the just-published, 430,000-word book to the star. Although
Travolta wasn't a big fan of science fiction, he says the
futuristic novel about a group of beleaguered humans fighting their
evil alien overlords on Planet Earth, circa A.D. 3000, was ``good
fun ... a classic tale of good vs. evil.''
</P>
<P>
   When Travolta's Hollywood clout began to recede (think ``Staying
Alive''), Scientology officials tried to get the ball rolling
themselves, erecting a 30-foot-high inflatable figure of Terl, the
chief alien villain, on Sunset Boulevard in 1984 to attract studio
interest. A director was hired and auditions were held in Denver,
but the low-budget project soon fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   That might have been the end of it had Travolta not revived his
career a decade later with ``Pulp Fiction'' and a string of
successive hits that included ``Phenomenon,'' ``Get Shorty,''
``Michael'' and ``The General's Daughter.'' Travolta again could
make any movie he wanted, and the movie he wanted to make remained
``Battlefield Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   His passion wasn't shared by everyone in his camp. Premiere
magazine recently reported that Travolta ``threatened to bolt
William Morris (his agency)'' if it didn't help him set up
``Battlefield Earth.'' Fellow Scientologist Tom Cruise reportedly
thought the movie was a bad idea, too, passing along his opinion to
Warner Bros. (Cruise's spokesperson denies this.)
</P>
<P>
   Travolta, for his part, doesn't seem to care about anyone else's
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ```Battlefield Earth' is the pinnacle of using my power for
something,'' Travolta told the New York Daily News. ``I can get
things done that a studio might not normally do. I told my manager,
`If we can't do the things now that we want to do, what good is the
power? Let's test it and try to get the things done that we believe
in.'''
</P>
<P>
   The inevitable question then is this: If Travolta believes this
strongly in the movie, isn't there something more to the material
other than mindless entertainment?
</P>
<P>
   In his introduction to ``Battlefield Earth,'' Hubbard waves off
connections between Scientology and the novel, calling the book
``pure science fiction.'' He wrote the book in 1980, returning to
space operas after his Scientology church had been battered by
years of lawsuits and investigations alleging fraud and
brainwashing.
</P>
<P>
   The book was a best seller, although the sales figures were
later tainted by revelations that Scientologists often bought boxes
of the novel themselves to drive it up the best-seller charts. And
while the potboiler plot of ``Battlefield Earth'' seems rather
innocuous, some see definite similarities in it to Hubbard's
Scientology teachings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly meant to be an allegory,'' says Scott Martin, the
science-fiction editor at SPACE.com. ``Hubbard himself noted that
it's not so much about the aliens as about the unconscious forces
keeping human beings in slavery. Chief among these forces are
socially enforced superstition, as well as personal feelings of
fear and inadequacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Shorthand comparisons tie the name of ``Earth's'' black-hearted
aliens, the Psychlos, to psychologists, a group Hubbard fought and
derided in his teachings. Martin says that's a bit simplistic, and
that the true connection lies with the church's teachings about the
``thetan,'' a person's spirit or soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interesting thing is actually how similar Scientology is
to a lot of early science fiction,'' Martin says. ``Both offer
fantasies of universal power and wish fulfillment. Where else do
readers get to vicariously destroy planets, save the world and be
the omnipotent, square-jawed hero?''
</P>
<P>
   There have also been reports that profits from the film's
merchandising deals will go to Author Services Inc., the agency
that handles all of Hubbard's books. Scientology spokesman Mike
Rinder denies that Author Services is connected to the church, but
others believe the relationship is there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way that this movie would be happening without
Scientology's backing,'' says Stacey Brooks, a former member of the
sect and current president of the Scientology-watchdog group Lisa
McPherson Trust. ``This is one example of how Scientology
insinuates itself in various aspects of the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Krane says the arrangement with Author Services is standard
practice, as rights holders normally receive a cut of merchandising
when a film is based on their work. Moreover, he says that Author
Services is a ``profit-oriented organization that has every right
to make money from Hubbard's books.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All the anti-Scientology blather surrounding this movie is
just pure nonsense,'' Krane adds. ``You didn't hear anything like
this when DreamWorks made `The Prince of Egypt.' Where were all the
stories about Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg and their
Jewish faiths when that movie came out? There weren't any. And
that's why I find all this focus on John's Scientology a little
laughable. The movie isn't about that.''
</P>
<P>
   And even if it were, says Fuller Theological Seminary's Robert
Johnston, there wouldn't be anything wrong with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``All movies offer meaning and provide a perspective on life,''
says Johnston, a professor of theology and culture. ``The
Scientologists have as much right as anyone to portray their take
on reality. And I have to believe that somewhere in the movie,
there is something that speaks to Travolta besides popcorn
entertainment. If he loves the story so much, it must speak to him
in some way. And I don't mind that. That's what good stories are
all about.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Due to conflicts over North American distribution rights, ``The
Decalogue,'' one of the great masterpieces of world cinema, has
been all but impossible to see in the United States for almost a
dozen years. But it's finally being telecast on cable's Sundance
Channel, starting tonight at 9.
</P>
<P>
   The supreme achievement of Poland's late, filmmaking philosopher
king Krzysztof Kieslowski (``Three Colors: Red, White and Blue''),
``The Decalogue'' consists of 10 one-hour dramas made for Polish
television in 1988 and '89. Each story takes one of the Ten
Commandments as a jumping-off point for exploring complicated moral
and spiritual dilemmas in the modern world.
</P>
<P>
   Set in and around a large Warsaw apartment complex that's home
to assorted professionals (doctors, lawyers, college professors,
philharmonic musicians) at the tail end of the communist regime,
each segment is a discrete story. Most were shot by a different,
brilliant cinematographer and the whole cycle features a who's who
of Poland's best actors.
</P>
<P>
   Some characters and even plot lines make brief appearances in
other episodes, but every chapter is richly, rewardingly complete
within itself. The 10 of them put together add up, quite simply, to
as thorough a mosaic of human behavior as has ever been committed
to film.
</P>
<P>
   Though biblically based and certainly concerned with, among
other things, the nature of man's relationship to God, the films
are anything but sanctimonious (or, for that matter, the faithless
opposite). Rather, they constantly examine the myriad ways in which
any system mankind tries to apply to ordering the world _ religion,
science, politics, ethics, law, economics _ can fail in the face of
messy human nature.
</P>
<P>
   Making ``The Decalogue'' even more profound is the fact that
Kieslowski and his co-writer, Krzysztof Piesiewicz, though ironists
of a high order, are not cynics. They acknowledge the necessity of
organizing principles in life, however limited their effectiveness
may be.
</P>
<P>
   The most outstanding of ``The Decalogue's'' many fine qualities,
however, is its enveloping, empathetic humanism. People do
careless, arrogant, selfish and even monstrous things throughout
the 10 chapters, yet we come away feeling that we understand all of
them in the deepest way imaginable, in all their loneliness,
passion, disappointment ... Above all, their rationales for doing
what they do in an imperfect world. It's a remarkable achievement,
considering how relatively short a time we spend in each
individual's company.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, during one of his last interviews before retiring from
filmmaking (and, two years later, succumbing to a heart attack),
Kieslowski explained the sympathetic philosophy that guided his
probing, aching and exhilaratingly forgiving art.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it all stems from the fact that I don't know anything
about morality myself,'' Kieslowski said. ``I really don't know
anything for real, and I don't know how to live, either. Therefore,
I cannot tell anybody what's good and what's bad. These are the
issues that should be left to the people who know things about
them; the politicians, teachers and priests know about it, so I
don't have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Like I said, Kieslowski was a world-class ironist. But he
couldn't disguise his inextinguishable interest in the most
important matters of heart and soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I always look into it,'' he said. ``But you see, I
am the kind of guy who poses questions. There are people who are
assigned to present answers, and then there are people like me.''
</P>
<P>
   The first two ``Decalogues'' premiere on Sundance tonight. They
will be rerun, along with the other eight chapters, throughout the
month of May. Check your local cable listings for dates and times. &QL;

and vulgar, ``The Turning Point'' being the supreme example.
Something about the Hollywood/high-art hybrid always having to
indulge silly melodrama in the hopes of attracting a mass audience.
</P>
<P>
   This year's model, ``Center Stage,'' doesn't come close to
``Turning's'' high point of shrill tastelessness, but it's not for
lack of trying. This one is your basic collection of aspiring
trainee cliches _ think ``Fame'' with a dumber plot and prettier
dancing _ all tied up with a ``modern'' production number so
astonishingly crass that even MTV might refuse to run it in the wee
hours. For ``Stage's'' climax, of course, it triumphantly brings
down the house at Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   The movie charts the struggles, misadventures and, of course,
dreams of a pack of young students at the American Ballet Academy,
the elite New York institution connected at the hip to the renowned
American Ballet Theatre. Mostly played by real dancers who ain't
exactly movie actors, the troupe includes our heroine, Jody (San
Francisco Ballet's Amanda Schull), a pretty blonde with bad
technique; Eva (Zoe Saldana), a tough-talking, street-smart ethnic
who, just the opposite of her whit friend, is such a great natural
dancer she doesn't even need to practice; and Maureen (Susan May
Pratt), a snooty school superstar with bulimia and a
vicariously-living mother.
</P>
<P>
   These girls and some of their guy friends (boy who worships Jody
from afar, gay African-American, etc.) have their various clashes
with the by-the-book dancing establishment as represented by
demanding instructors (God, they're sooo fascist) and the smarmy
artistic director Jonathan Reeves (Peter Gallagher), who holds
their fates in his untrustworthy hands.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky for mediocre Jody, the cute resident ABT star Cooper
Neilson (real ABT superstar Ethan Stiefel) takes a shine to her. Of
course, he thinks he's only interested for a night or two. But
then, Cooper needs a dancer who's willing to do anything, if not
necessarily well, for the new style (read: ``Flashdance'') ballet
he's choreographing in response to the stuffy, traditional
graduation piece his arch-rival Reeves is mounting. If Jody brings
a few emotional resentments to the act, well, all the better.
</P>
<P>
   There really is a lot of excellent dancing in ``Center Stage,''
and the fantasy aspect of it should appeal to every
ballerina-in-her-own-mind the nation's junior high schools contain.
Camera choreography is expert as well; the director is Nicholas
Hytner, who's done ``Miss Saigon'' and ``Carousel'' on stage, and
the cinematographer is Australia's fine Geoffrey Simpson
(``Shine,'' ``Oscar and Lucinda''). The dreadful dialogue was
written by Carol Heikkinen, whose two other music-related films,
``The Thing Called Love'' and ``Empire Records,'' barely got
released. &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
The film: ``Center Stage'' (PG-13; sex, language). &QL; 
The stars: Amanda Schull, Zoe Saldana, Susan May Pratt, Ethan
Stiefel, Peter Gallagher, Donna Murphy, Debra Monk. &QL;

REPLACES EARLIER INCOMPLETE VERSION 
MASTERPIECE TO RUN IN U.S.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Due to conflicts over North American distribution rights, ``The
Decalogue,'' one of the great masterpieces of world cinema, has
been all but impossible to see in the United States for almost a
dozen years. But it's finally being telecast on cable's Sundance
Channel, starting tonight at 9.
</P>
<P>
   The supreme achievement of Poland's late, filmmaking philosopher
king Krzysztof Kieslowski (``Three Colors: Red, White and Blue''),
``The Decalogue'' consists of 10 one-hour dramas made for Polish
television in 1988 and '89. Each story takes one of the Ten
Commandments as a jumping-off point for exploring complicated moral
and spiritual dilemmas in the modern world.
</P>
<P>
   Set in and around a large Warsaw apartment complex that's home
to assorted professionals (doctors, lawyers, college professors,
philharmonic musicians) at the tail end of the communist regime,
each segment is a discrete story. Most were shot by a different,
brilliant cinematographer and the whole cycle features a who's who
of Poland's best actors.
</P>
<P>
   Some characters and even plot lines make brief appearances in
other episodes, but every chapter is richly, rewardingly complete
within itself. The 10 of them put together add up, quite simply, to
as thorough a mosaic of human behavior as has ever been committed
to film.
</P>
<P>
   Though biblically based and certainly concerned with, among
other things, the nature of man's relationship to God, the films
are anything but sanctimonious (or, for that matter, the faithless
opposite). Rather, they constantly examine the myriad ways in which
any system mankind tries to apply to ordering the world _ religion,
science, politics, ethics, law, economics _ can fail in the face of
messy human nature.
</P>
<P>
   Making ``The Decalogue'' even more profound is the fact that
Kieslowski and his co-writer, Krzysztof Piesiewicz, though ironists
of a high order, are not cynics. They acknowledge the necessity of
organizing principles in life, however limited their effectiveness
may be.
</P>
<P>
   The most outstanding of ``The Decalogue's'' many fine qualities,
however, is its enveloping, empathetic humanism. People do
careless, arrogant, selfish and even monstrous things throughout
the 10 chapters, yet we come away feeling that we understand all of
them in the deepest way imaginable, in all their loneliness,
passion, disappointment ... Above all, their rationales for doing
what they do in an imperfect world. It's a remarkable achievement,
considering how relatively short a time we spend in each
individual's company.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, during one of his last interviews before retiring from
filmmaking (and, two years later, succumbing to a heart attack),
Kieslowski explained the sympathetic philosophy that guided his
probing, aching and exhilaratingly forgiving art.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it all stems from the fact that I don't know anything
about morality myself,'' Kieslowski said. ``I really don't know
anything for real, and I don't know how to live, either. Therefore,
I cannot tell anybody what's good and what's bad. These are the
issues that should be left to the people who know things about
them; the politicians, teachers and priests know about it, so I
don't have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Like I said, Kieslowski was a world-class ironist. But he
couldn't disguise his inextinguishable interest in the most
important matters of heart and soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I always look into it,'' he said. ``But you see, I
am the kind of guy who poses questions. There are people who are
assigned to present answers, and then there are people like me.''
</P>
<P>
   The first two ``Decalogues'' premiere on Sundance tonight. They
will be rerun, along with the other eight chapters, throughout the
month of May. Check your local cable listings for dates and times. &QL;

 &HT;    VENTURE CAPITAL, CONSUMER DEMAND FUELING CHINA'S DOTCOM
EXPLOSION
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (f) Financial categories.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., May 14 And Thereafter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Eleven years ago, Steve Sun was a student
hunger-striker on Tiananmen Square being interviewed by CBS News's
Dan Rather on why China needed democracy. Today, with an American
MBA and three years of Wall Street experience, he is a dotcom chief
executive with a 14th-floor corner office in one of Beijing's
newest high-rises.
</P>
<P>
   He and two partners decided only late last year to get in on the
Internet action in China. They threw together a business plan in 10
days, raised more than enough capital in two weeks to start their
company and launched Sinobit.com less than two months later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the signing of the (World Trade Organization) agreement
between China and the United States that really expedited the
process,'' Sun said, referring to the sweeping trade accord signed
last November. ``We had a conference call that night and really
moved fast.''
</P>
<P>
   He is part of a trickle of students with a U.S. education
returning to China which, though not nearly significant enough to
reverse a decades-long brain drain, is certainly helping fuel the
explosive growth of the Internet in this country of 1.3 billion.
From nearly all facets _ users, entrepreneurs and investors _
interest in all things Web-related is huge and the pace of change
has been breakneck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Silicon Valley squared,'' said Jay Chang, an analyst
for Credit Suisse/First Boston in Hong Kong who specializes in the
Internet in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, government restrictions on content and certain
business operations may be hindering the Web's development, but
entrepreneurs see them as just a part of doing business. In fact,
dotcoms are being formed at the rate of two a day, according to the
state-run China Daily.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the government's blocking of certain foreign Web sites
keeping surfers away. The number of Internet users here has been
doubling every six months for the last two years, reaching 8.9
million at the end of last year, according to official Chinese
government figures. Although penetration is low, if triple-digit
growth keeps up, China could have the world's largest Internet
population in just five years.
</P>
<P>
   Almost more quickly than Web surfers can log on, Chinese
entrepreneurs have been giving them more places to click to _ from
sports and entertainment sites to on-line bookstores and
newspapers. Sinobit, which helps select start-ups find capital,
hoped to get 3,000 applications in its first year for its ``Dream
Lab,'' where potential investors can review business plans. In less
than two months, with very little advertising, they received more
than 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Feeding this expansion are venture capitalists, mostly from the
United States, but also from Hong Kong, Japan and within China
itself. Until just a of couple months ago, the sense was that they
were throwing money at just about anyone with an idea and an
impressive management team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was happening all the time _ some Chinese kid with an MBA
and a slick business presentation getting loads of money,'' said
Mark Baldwin, chief executive of Zhaopin.com, a Beijing
head-hunting firm with a job listing site. ``(Venture capitalists)
love people who talk their language.''
</P>
<P>
   While overseas investors are now showing somewhat more restraint
toward new start-ups, analysts say they don't seem to have the
patience in China that they did with the U.S. market, where they
allow a few years to build an audience before worrying about
profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whereas in the United States, you had that honeymoon
traffic-only stage for a couple years, in China, 1999 was all about
growing page-views. In 2000, they're starting to focus on
revenues,'' said Christopher Mumford, founder of YaoLan.com, the
leading baby-care Web site. ``I think in six to nine months, it's
going to be, 'OK, you have to show us a profit.'''
</P>
<P>
   Having the U.S. experience to go by is both a blessing and a
curse, Chinese analysts and executives say.
</P>
<P>
   While Chinese dotcoms have emulated many of the American
business models, they worry that U.S. investors are blindly
applying they're own market conditions to China, which lags at
least a couple of years behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like feeding a baby with beef,'' said Joseph Chen, chief
executive of ChinaRen.com, a Web site geared towards young people.
``A baby needs milk.''
</P>
<P>
   The most intense competition is among the portals, which are
also the leading consumers of foreign capital and are all vying to
become the Yahoo of China. ChinaRen, a U.S.-funded company started
by Chen and two other under-30 Chinese students who all met at
Stanford University, is not unlike other start-ups in that it
spends 70 percent of its budget on marketing and public relations.
It has booked billboard space for the next year-and-a-half. In
fact, billboard space in Beijing is sold out for the next three
years, mostly to high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   Because the industry is so young, the search for experienced
employees often leads to a rival's personnel list, which is a
highly-guarded commodity at many companies. Chen said one of his
project managers was offered a six-fold salary increase by a
competitor. He convinced the employee to stay with a promotion and
a 60-percent pay raise. ChinaRen programmers make as much as
US$3,000 a month _ a phenomenal salary in China, where the average
factory worker's monthly wage is less than US$150 and a
journalist's less than US$400.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from U.S. high-tech companies are also being poached
by China's dotcoms. Henry Huang, chairman of a high-tech P.R. firm
in Beijing whose clients include Microsoft, Dell and Intel,
estimates 70 percent of the Chinese managers and directors working
for the big-name American companies have jumped ship for a
start-up.
</P>
<P>
   ChinaRen focuses on the under-25 set, allowing them to create
their own Web pages and post photos.
</P>
<P>
   But in the midst of these unprecedented new avenues for personal
expression, ChinaRen is ever mindful not to upset China's communist
government. With more than 20,000 new photos uploaded every day, 10
people are employed just to vet them. CEO Chen says they avoid
``pornography, politically sensitive stuff; no religious promotion.
It's strictly entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government has conflicting motives, analysts say,
wanting to maintain control over the Internet while wanting to see
it develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to become a 21st-Century superpower,'' said Chang,
the Internet analyst. ``To do that, you have to use the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The legal and regulatory framework is still playing catch-up.
While dotcoms wait for a comprehensive set of rules, they've had to
work with piecemeal restrictions on who can provide original news
content, how much foreign investment is allowed, and when and how a
Chinese company can go public abroad. Sina.com, the leading portal,
was forced to carve out its Chinese assets and operations before
listing on Nasdaq last month. And other Chinese dotcoms with IPO
dreams will have to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Although Chinese Web sites may be politically tame, Internet
exhibitions _ which seem to take place every other week here in
Beijing _ can veer towards the wild side. At COMDEX last month,
attendees were treated to Western women in precariously fastened
halter tops, surrounded by a crowd five-deep, shaking and kicking
to the blasting music while girls in metallic miniskirts and roller
blades handed out brochures.
</P>
<P>
   At Internet World, the audience mobbed the seminar speakers _
mostly Internet executives and investment bankers _ like they were
rock stars. But instead of asking for an autograph, it was a
business card they were all after.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   While Internet companies in China are careful to stay well
within political boundaries, most recognize the Web's potential to
transform Chinese society.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, you can say anything you want on the Web,'' said Lu
Benfu, an Internet researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, government think tank. ``This will open society even
more. Secondly, it will help Chinese people enter the world
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Much as Westerners talk about the free-wheeling Internet
fomenting political change, though, Chinese people, who've proven
adept at adapting to new technologies, don't see it as such a
revolutionary new medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``China will change on its own path at its own speed, but with
determination from the top'' Chen said. ``No external force will
change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the 1989 student demonstrations at Tiananmen Square are
``kind of remote now'' for Sinobit.com's Sun, he still hasn't
forgotten about the six students from his university killed in the
massacre.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Internet for him foremost is a business venture,
``at least a side effect will be to promote democracy and freedom
in the world. in 10 days, raised more than enough capital in two
weeks to start their company and launched Sinobit.com less than two
months later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the signing of the (World Trade Organization) agreement

process,'' Sun said, referring to the sweeping trade accord signed
last November. ``We had a conference call that night and really

   HAMILTON-JORDAN _ Twenty years ago, Hamilton Jordan was the
gatekeeper who controlled access to the most powerful man in the
country, a brash newcomer to Washington who moonlighted as
Georgetown's most notorious pubcrawler. Today, former President
Carter's chief-of-staff has no power than any other Little League
assistant coach. Between one life and another, he went through a
divorce, has survived cancer three times, run for the U.S. Senate

   CUBAN-BOY (Atlanta) _ Aggressively questioning both sides, three
federal appeals judges asked today whether 6-year-old Elian
Gonzalez is too young to apply for asylum and whether being from
communist Cuba compromises his father's parental rights. Judge J.L.
Edmondson, a Reagan appointee expressed concern that the boy would
be sent back to a Communist country. But in an unusual move, he
appeared in court before the hearing began and cautioned the
audience not to read anything into his questions and statements
from the bench. Judge Charles Wilson, a Clinton appointee, asked
how Elian could apply for asylum if he was to young to even write
his own name. Judge Edmondson also said a ruling would probably
come in ``weeks.'' By Rick Bragg.

   ECON-FED (Washington) _ In 1994, when the conventional wisdom
held that inflation was all but inevitable if the economy grew more
than 2.25 percent a year or unemployment fell much below 6 percent,
Alan Greenspan posed a provocative question to his colleagues at
the Federal Reserve. ``Is it automatically the case,'' Greenspan
asked, ``that when the economy is tightening up that inflation
takes hold?'' He did not have an answer at the time. But such early
musings stimulated considerable debate within the Fed, and
ultimately led the central bank in effect to suspend the old rules
about the relationship between growth, unemployment and inflation.
Judging that rapid advances in technology were making businesses

on prices, the Fed instead gave the economy more or less free rein
to find its own limits. It may now have found them. By Richard W.

<P>
   In a long-awaited legal showdown in the custody battle over
Elian Gonzalez, lawyers for the two sides of the boy's family, as
well as those for the U.S. government, argued their cases in an
Atlanta federal court Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers distilled five months of an international struggle
that has embroiled two governments, thousands of Cuban-Americans
and a family bitterly divided by politics to an hour-and-a-half of
legal arguments at the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   As more than 100 supporters chanted and waved banners outside
the courthouse, lawyers for Elian's Miami relatives tried to
persuade a three-judge panel to make the Immigration and
Naturalization Service grant the 6-year-old boy an asylum hearing.
But Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, and the U.S. Justice
Department believe the boy should be returned promptly to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, the immigration agency returned Elian's
asylum application to his Miami relatives without reading it,
saying that only the boy's father could speak for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bond between a parent and his child is not only recognized
in our constitutional order, but is recognized throughout the
world,'' James Castello, a lawyer for the government, said in a
news conference following the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But in an earlier ruling, the judges in this case indicated that
immigration laws do not set a minimum age for an asylum applicant.
The relevant statute says that ``any alien'' may apply for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   In the courtroom, lawyers for the Miami relatives repeatedly
stressed that point. They also argued that the Cuban government
would persecute Elian because the boy's mother had fled the
country.
</P>
<P>
   But Gregory Craig, the lawyer for Juan Miguel Gonzalez, said the
ongoing custody battle has taken a heavy toll on Elian's family,
and that the boy's asylum application cannot be taken seriously
because a 6-year-old is too young to hold informed political
beliefs. Many child psychologists have agreed with that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``This family is in jeopardy of being destroyed if this case
goes on much longer,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The judges threw pointed questions at both sides. They asked
government lawyers what would have happened if Elian's mother had
survived, or if she had been a woman who died trying to cross from
East Berlin to West Berlin during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the government lawyers said, the child should
still be reunited with his father.
</P>
<P>
   The judges also asked Craig whether the fact that Elian's father
is living under a communist government compromises his abilities to
be a parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been free to express openly his feelings and his
opinions throughout,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   The judges grilled the lawyers for the Miami relatives about
whether Elian understood the contents and gravity of his asylum
application. The lawyers insisted that the boy knows he does not
want to return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez and Marisleysis Gonzalez, Elian's great-uncle
and cousin, arrived at the gray stone courthouse in downtown
Atlanta at 8 a.m., one hour before arguments were scheduled to
begin, according to The Associated Press. They were greeted by
cheering supporters waving both Cuban and U.S. flags and carrying
placards with slogans like ``Give Elian His Day in Court.'' Like
thousands of Cuban-Americans, the Miami relatives do not want to
see the boy returned to a communist nation headed by President
Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, the lawyer representing Elian's father, strode into the
courthouse to the jeers of Cuban-American protesters. His client,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, did not attend.
</P>
<P>
   Elian is staying with his father, stepmother, 6-month-old
stepbrother, several former schoolmates and a teacher at a
farmhouse on the 1,100-acre Wye River conference center, which the
government had used for Middle East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The father and son were re-united on April 22 after Attorney
General Janet Reno ordered a pre-dawn raid on the home of Elian's
Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The two were separated since last November, when Elian's mother,
Elizabet Brotons, took him on a smuggling boat in an ill-fated
attempt to reach the United States. When the vessel capsized,
Brotons and 10 other Cubans drowned. But Elian was discovered on
Nov. 25 clinging to an inner-tube off the Florida coast.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was given ``parole'' status by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service and placed in the custody of Lazaro Gonzalez
in Miami. Days before the raid, Lazaro Gonzalez defied government
orders to hand over the boy, hoping to stall federal officials
until the Atlanta court could decide on the asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The court's three-judge panel, made up of Judges J.L. Edmondson,
Joel A. Dubin and Charles R. Wilson, is to expedite their decision
and announce it within two or three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   If the Atlanta court sides with the boy's father, lawyers for
the Miami relatives have 45 days to ask all 12 judges of the
federal court to hear the case. If the court denies that request,
the lawyers have 90 days to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Atlanta court does force the INS to look at the
boy's application, legal experts say there is little chance the
agency will grant asylum to Elian. Successful asylum seekers must
prove that they have been persecuted or that they have a
``well-found fear'' of persecution if they return to their
homeland. So far, experts say, there is no evidence that Elian
would meet those standards.

&HT;     THE LOVE BUG IS THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS ON THE NET 
</HEADLINE>

 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The so-called ``Love Bug'' computer virus has been largely tamed
_ downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical depression _ but it has
left plenty of fear and loathing in its destructive wake. And there
remain other storms on the virtual horizon.
</P>
<P>
   The havoc that VBS.LoveLetter.A wreaked was a strong reminder of
how widespread and virulent the shadowy world of computer viruses
remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really scary how much damage computer viruses can do, and
there are a lot of them out there,'' said Tom Gebauer, multi-media
developer at Media Logic, an advertising and design firm in
Colonie, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's 50 employees got an early warning and were able to
delete the virus before ``Love Bug'' overwrote and trashed their
vast number of graphics files, known as jpegs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a strong warning to be on the alert for other viruses
ready to create problems,'' said George Purdue, vice president of
management information systems at The HUM Group, a medical
malpractice insurer based in Latham, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue and his team had the ``Love Bug'' virus cleaned up and
blocked from their Microsoft Outlook e-mail system. But Purdue
won't let his guard down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect we'll see a lot of copycats,'' Purdue said. ``It's a
simple Visual Basic Script file. It would be easy to re-name it and
send it out again. An eighth-grader could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's attack by the ``Love Bug'' virus was merely the
latest among 47,205 identified and defused viruses, according to
the AntiVirus Research Center of Symantec Corp., based in
Cupertino, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The Symantec Web site, with a downloadable antidote to the
``Love Bug'' virus, was flooded with hits last week and difficult
to access.
</P>
<P>
   After numerous tries, Fred Halley Jr., facilities manager at
IKON Office Solutions, a computer training company in Latham, was
able to download Symantec's new Norton Anti-Virus program.
</P>
<P>
   That followed anxious moments after the virus struck his office
disguised as an e-mail with the heading ``ILOVEYOU.''

 &HT;    CHECHENS STEP UP ATTACKS, RUSSIA COOL ON TALKS

   MOSCOW _ After a fresh string of successful attacks by Chechen
rebels against crack Russian squadrons and mixed messages from
Moscow about peace talks, the nine-month-old war on Russia's
southern border threatens to drag through the summer, analysts said
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of Russia's presidential elections in March the army
claimed a territorial victory over the separatists, who are
fighting for independence from Russia. Generals said the army
controlled all key areas in the Muslim-dominated republic the size
of Maryland, and was chasing down the remnants of what they called
wounded and demoralized groups of rebel fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Independent military observers doubted Kremlin claims that the
situation was under control, predicting instead that rebel
formations would evade the army, hideout in their mountain
headquarters and plan for a new spring offensive _ a parallel to
events in the first Chechen war that saw separatist rebels taking
back the whole republic from the Russian army in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   These predictions have held true, and over the last two months
the highly mobile formations of fighters have shown once again that
although they may be fewer, they are definitely not out of the
fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been like clock-work,'' said Sergei Karaganov, the
chairman of Moscow's Foreign and Defense Policy Council, a think
tank . ``Once the leaves blossom on the trees, (the rebels) started
fighting again. Moscow has no exit strategy out of this guerrilla
war. It doesn't want to talk peace. So, of course this is going to
drag on.''
</P>
<P>
   Since March, Russian forces have, on average, experienced 30
casualties per week, bringing the total reported dead to 2,250 and
wounded to 6,575, according to General Valery Manilov, the deputy
chief of the Russian general staff. Russian non-governmental
organizations claim the military under-reports losses, however, and
say the real figure is closer to 10,000 dead.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel causality figures are much harder to come by. Daily
reports are contradictory. If all the Kremlin claims were added up,
the army has killed more than 100,000 rebels. Rebel spokesmen offer
no numbers of their own.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the war in August, Russian officials
estimated the rebel fighting force to be about 20,000. The rebels
estimated their numbers at 15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Military analysts now estimate there are some 7,000 rebels still
fighting. In comparison, Russia currently has about 50,000 troops
in the region, down from the 100,000 stationed in the republic
during the fiercest fighting in December and January.
</P>
<P>
   If the war was only a numbers game, the rebels would have been
down and out long ago. But experience, training and tactics have
definitely played a more influential role in battle. Even Russia's
military brass has had to admit that their poor organization,
communications and planning have contributed to their losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rebels are guerrilla fighters. This is their land, their
terrain. Russians aren't trained for these hit-and-run battles,''
said Karaganov.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after two months of relative quiet, the Chechens are
ratcheting up their attacks. In an interview with the French
newspaper Le Figaro last week, Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov
said he had given orders to the fighters to step up the guerrilla
war against the Russian army.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the rebels claimed that they had killed 30 Russian
soldiers in an ambush attack just 30 miles from the devastated
capital Grozny, a position that Russia has said was completely
cleansed of fighters as far back as February.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers were impossible to independently verify. If true,
it would mark the single-most deadly one-day attack since Chechens
ambushed a Russian patrol in March, killing 40 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a group of decommissioned Russian soldiers came
under attack in Ingushetia, the Russian region bordering Chechnya
and an area considered outside the war zone. No one took immediate
responsibility for the attack, but Gen. Manilov said he suspected
the rebels. A total of 18 Russians were killed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov, the highest-ranking popularly elected Chechen
official and a man Russian President Vladimir Putin has placed on
Russia's Most-Wanted List of criminals, also said in his interview
he would be willing to begin peace negotiations with the Kremlin
through a third-party intermediary.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has not made any public statement about Maskhadov's offer.
Other officials have uttered conflicting signals.
</P>
<P>
   The politician Putin named to head up a human rights commission
for Chechnya told reporters Thursday he was ready to meet with
Maskhadov. In a separate briefing on the same day, however, Manilov
refused to consider such talks. ``The talk about political
negotiations is nonsense. Aslan Maskhadov is wanted by the police.
We will not talk to him,'' Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
   Army officers deny that they are concerned about the spread of
fighting outside of the southern front, where the Russians have
concentrated their forces, and still insist they have the rebels
licked.
</P>
<P>
   Unnamed security officials told the Interfax news agency this
week that the rebels don't have the capability to launch
large-scale attacks and would continue separate but inconsequential
raids, sabotage and terrorist actions against military and civilian
targets in the republic.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's general in charge of Chechnya appealed to the militants
to lay down their weapons and take advantage of the amnesty Moscow
has offered until May 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are tired of war, they want peace and a normal life,
therefore take advantage of the amnesty,'' Maj. Gen. Gennady
Troshev said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a sober look at the situation, consider your actions and
lay down your arms.''

 &HT;    TURNER MEETS WITH PUTIN TO 'CATCH UP'

   MOSCOW _ Atlanta's favorite son Ted Turner pulled off quite a
coup Thursday, snagging a private meeting in the Kremlin with
arguably one of the world's most private and controversial people,
Russian President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting side-by-side with Putin in the Kremlin's Blue Room,
Turner said he requested the meeting in order to catch up with an
old friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did good work together in the mid-1990s when we organized
the Goodwill Games, a lot of time had passed and we have a lot to
catch up on,'' Russian television quoted Turner as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Turner dreamed up the Goodwill Games, an amateur sporting
competition similar to the Olympics, in the late 1980s as a way to
help strengthen U.S.-Russia ties with the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The two men worked together to organize the 1994 games in St.
Petersburg, Putin's hometown, and where he was deputy mayor.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Turner's other sports and media ventures, the
games were widely considered a failure.
</P>
<P>
   Turner _ founder of CNN and owner of the Atlanta Braves _ was
not available for comment after the Kremlin meeting, but his
spokeswoman Maura Donlan characterized the meeting as ``amiable.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men discussed reviving the Goodwill Games by 2005. They
also discussed peace and security issues.
</P>
<P>
   Turner organized the chat as part of a three-day trip to the
Russian capital to hobnob with other Russian luminaries during
Friday's scheduled grand opening of Former Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev's new library. The Turner Foundation donated an
undisclosed amount for the building.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, the former head of Russia's secret service, was elected
president on March 26. During his campaign he shunned press
interviews and kept meetings with private individuals to a minimum,
culling a reputation as an aloof and somewhat shady politician.
</P>
<P>
   Cracking this stereotype a bit, Donlan said the media mogul
clinched the meeting with Putin without any trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just went through the usual channels. It was very easy,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   When berated by a reporter for tips on how to gain access to
Putin, the advice given was matter-of-fact: Putin never forgets his
friends.

<P>
   Shhhh! Listen hard and you may hear them, the gruesome
hobgoblins and shabby boogeymen that rattle around in the basement
of Phelim McDermott's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   His china-blue eyes have a look of peaceful innocence, but don't
let McDermott fool you: This guy's got an incurable case of the
heebie-jeebies. His ooky-spooky childhood sounds like something out
of Tim Burton's next screenplay. Say a name that strikes terror in
young hearts _ Cruella de Vil, for instance _ and McDermott, 37,
practically turns giddy with remembered fear and pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something strong, there's something potent,'' the
pale, puckish Englishman says with an appreciable shiver, though
the weather outside his Wilshire Boulevard publicist's office is
typical L.A. _ sun- drenched and seasonably mild.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really know that I can put it into words. But there
were certain books when I was a kid that I used to look at, and I
used to go back to and open the pages, and go, 'Aaaggh!' and shut
it! I think it's because they talk about things that aren't
supposed to be talked about _ violence, whatever. And that's what
the world's like. It's out there.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also tucked into the murky nooks and crannies of
``Shockheaded Peter,'' the gleefully macabre ``junk opera,''
co-directed by McDermott and Julian Crouch that opens a two-week
run tonight at UCLA's Freud Playhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by ``The Struwwelpeter (Slovenly Peter),'' a whimsical
1844 work by the German psychiatrist Heinrich Hoffman,
``Shockheaded Peter'' is a high-spirited musical parody of those
Victorian cautionary tales about the torments and terrors that
await disobedient children (such as its high-haired namesake).
</P>
<P>
   Don't play with matches! Stop fidgeting! Eat your soup or you'll
waste away! Don't suck your thumbs or a scary man with a huge pair
of scissors will come snip them off!
</P>
<P>
   In ``Shockheaded Peter,'' each morally erring youngster who
violates these parental commandments meets a ghastly, untimely
fate, depicted in stylized, Grand Guignol violence that elicit both
screams and laughter from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Narrated by a cadaverous emcee (Bleach), the show is set to the
eerily gloating tunes of the Tiger Lillies, a three-piece band
(squeezebox, bass and drums). Five actors, some alarmingly
humanlike puppets and low-tech sets and costumes conjure a
cartoonish horrorscape filled with trapdoors and optical tricks.
</P>
<P>
   Originally staged in northern England in 1997, ``Shockheaded
Peter'' recently played in Washington, D.C., where one reviewer
deemed it ``as brilliant as it is devilish ... think David Lynch
doing children's theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while the show may well be too intense and conceptually
sophisticated for very young children, McDermott observes that
there's always been a substantial grownup audience for books and
movies about nasty things happening to rebellious tykes. He points
to the scarifying oeuvre of the late American author/illustrator
Edward Gorey, a version of whose ``The Gashlycrumb Tinies''
McDermott once brought to the stage.

   ``I'm sure that Edward Gorey was influenced by the Hoffman
(book),'' says McDermott, a pleasant, personable chap who seems
perpetually on the lookout for surprises. ``Also, the Tim Burton
(movie) 'Edward Scissorhands' is again sort of tapping into that
myth.''
</P>
<P>
   McDermott began tapping such mythic primal power while growing
up in Manchester, where his family lived in a former vicarage he
says was briefly haunted by a poltergeist that ``kind of threw
objects around.''
</P>
<P>
   That otherworldly encounter engendered a previous show, the
critically acclaimed ``70 Hill Lane,'' which was produced at San
Diego's La Jolla Playhouse a few seasons back.
</P>
<P>
   ``That show was kind of looking at that part of my childhood,
which was quite isolated,'' he says. ``I didn't go out and sort of
do what other kids do. I was quite quiet and hidden away, and spent
a lot of time with books and fantasizing around those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Next month, the La Jolla will host a second show, ``Lifegame,''
put together by the Improbable Theatre, the London-based company of
which McDermott is artistic director. A big London hit,
``Lifegame'' uses actors, puppets and musicians to build an
original, improvised show around the life of a different,
pre-selected audience member for each performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very bright, very talented young artist who's got a
rich career ahead of him,'' La Jolla Playhouse artistic director
Anne Hamburger says of McDermott.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Manchester, a city better-known for its soccer
stars and mopey pop bands than its actors, theater proved to be
McDermott's escape hatch from his hermetically sealed youth.
</P>
<P>
   His parents took him frequently to the Royal Exchange in
Manchester and to Royal Shakespeare Company performances.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Middlesex Polytechnic, he went on to study
improvisational theater, took a couple of workshops with legendary
mime master Jacques Lecoq, and began doing solo improv in pubs.
</P>
<P>
   Before hooking up with Improbable Theatre's other core members,
Crouch and Lee Simpson, McDermott also worked extensively in the
British regional theater, directing plays like ``The Servant of Two
Masters'' and ``The Government Inspector.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his goals with Improbable has been to combine improv's
spontaneous inventiveness with the strong narrative line of more
traditional theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything we create (has) got to have a gap for the audience to
dream into,'' he says. ``I would say that that's what we try and
do, all our shows. If you go and see a show that hasn't got a gap
in it, you kind of sit back from it. Because you've not got any job
to do. The story's been told.'' &QL;

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only a short time ago, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was on a
roll, riding high as one of the most famous big-city mayors this
country has ever known.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he was wolfing down a hot dog at a Yankees game and
hanging with pals like Joe Torre, traveling to Arkansas to take
digs at the Clintons, schmoozing with Howard Stern's parents at a
live broadcast birthday party or getting into spirited battles with
artsy types over putatively religious paintings festooned with
elephant dung, Rudy G. was having the time of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Not since Oswald Copplepot considered a run for mayor of Gotham
City in ``Batman Returns'' have we seen such a gleefully mean guy
taking such a voracious bite out of the Big Apple.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy G. had it all. Great job, great health, great kids, great
wife, great girlfriend(s), I mean,
good-friends-who-just-happen-to-be-women.
</P>
<P>
   OK. So maybe he had too much going for him.
</P>
<P>
   Karma has a way of kicking you in the shins at times like this.
Over the last couple of weeks, fate has tattooed Giuliani on the
skull and soul with a devastating and quite public one-two-three
combination.
</P>
<P>
   In late April, Giuliani had a press conference to announce he'd
been diagnosed with prostate cancer. Treatable, but still.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, he told reporters he was ``very good friend(s)''
with Judith Nathan, a 45-year-old woman who'd been seen kanoodling
(as they say in the gossip press) with him at numerous events.
</P>
<P>
   And a week after that, Giuliani was again meeting with the
press, this time to acknowledge that he and his wife Donna Hanover
were discussing separation.
</P>
<P>
   (Is it even worth mentioning that Hanover is a sometimes-actress
who recently postponed her appearance in the play ``The Vagina
Monologues'' to deal with all this? Parenthetically, heck yes.)
</P>
<P>
   Hanover then squirted a stream of lighter fluid into the boiling
barbecue by calling a press conference of her own to confirm the
separation and to make a pointed reference to difficulties in her
marriage due to an alleged relationship in the past between
Giuliani and his former communications director, Cristyne
Lategano-Nicholas _ prompting Lategano-Nicholas to deliver her own
message to the press: ``I have no desire to speculate why Donna
Hanover decided to issue the statement that she did.
Understandably, this is a difficult time. I wish both the mayor and
Donna Hanover a successful resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   And then we have Hillary Clinton as a cold side dish to this big
heaping plate of steamy controversy. In response to the news about
Giuliani's cancer, Clinton actually had the astonishing gall to
begin her statement with, ``Like all New Yorkers...,'' thus
managing to act sympathetic and remind voters she's now a resident
of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Wow! And to think we're entertained just because our mayor gets
huffy and tells the media he's still thriving and they shouldn't
dig a plot for him in Holy Sepulchre Cemetery just yet. Chicago's
just a silly sitcom compared to the middle-aged version of
``Felicity'' they've got playing in New York.
</P>
<P>
   As Giuliani has stated, politics are not quite atop his ``To
Do'' list these days, not when he's got kids and cancer and
relationships to worry about. The once unthinkable _ that Rudy
might not run against Hillary for the U.S. Senate and that she will
go up against some less-than-colorful party regular _ now seems
quite probable.
</P>
<P>
   An undistracted Giuliani would have whupped Mrs. Clinton's ass
(to use the parlance of Jimmy Carter eyeing an antsy Teddy
Kennedy); but a beleaguered Rudy is extremely vulnerable. His best
move at this point would be to drop out.
</P>
<P>
   Then what? Unless the Republican Party can persuade one of the
battling Baldwin brothers to switch parties and throw his hair gel
into the ring, whoever emerges from the short list of GOP hopefuls
most likely won't be able to offset Mrs. Clinton's head start in
the campaign _ not to mention her money, power, fame and yes,
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Hillary Clinton. Get used to it. It's going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Thus giving the political media and the legions of
Clinton-hating extremists a reason for being in the 21st century.
The prospect of the former first lady returning to Washington as a
junior senator relegated to a relatively crummy office and begging
for committee membership crumbs from some of the very blowhards who
tried to run her husband out of office is almost too delicious to
contemplate.

TV REVIEWER TRIES OUT FOR ``BIG BROTHER''
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
With BIGBRO 
(Undated: TV news media.))
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lisa Nowicki, who was ``doing the usual receptionist/temp
routine'' until her break at stardom comes (she has her own 24/7
Web site at !bold!aspiringactresses.com!off!), said she showed up
even though members of actors unions were specifically discouraged
from auditioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to come no matter what they say,'' Nowicki
reasoned. ``I've already been interviewed by Channel 2 and now, by
you that only helps actors. Any crazy thing that an actor can do,
they !ital!will!off!.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of privacy did concern her, she admitted: ``Where would
I do my yoga? In the mornings, I need to be very quiet and light my
candles and be able to do my yoga.'' She added that the fact that
she has her own intrusive Web site demonstrates she could handle
``Big Brother's'' demands; if she won the $500,000 prize for being
the last contestant standing (after viewer votes eliminate
contestants that fall from their favor), she said, she'd ``make a
film with all my unemployed friends to help us get a start.''
</P>
<P>
   Another aspiring performer was waiter Andrew Moran, who said the
close living quarters didn't faze him: ``I'm living with five
people in a two-bedroom apartment now, and that's not a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Moran described the show as ``a three-month powwow the people
who do this will have to be smart. The people who were on `MTV's
Real World' were really stupid. This show is the most interesting
thing I've ever heard of it's like a piece of real life is being
taken out and put on a pedestal for audiences to view.''
</P>
<P>
   Moran said he responded to the question ``What types of people
would you choose to have living with you in the house?'' with:
``nine women.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Matthews, a student attending culinary school, and Felicia
Walker, a leasing consultant and writer, applied together. Walker
said being holed up for three months with utter strangers couldn't
be any worse than the past year of her life. ``I have nothing to
lose I was nearly paralyzed in an accident and almost had to file
for bankruptcy.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthews declared that if selected, he wouldn't provide any sort
of sensationalist confrontations. He said, ``Take away the hype,
and what's left? Yourself. I'm not gonna give 'em what they want
I'm gonna get what I want out of it for me.'' The $350-per-week pay
for contestants, he said, is better than he's done in other jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Rosalyn Earl, a student at California State University, Long
Beach, said she would hate to sacrifice the ability to hang with
her boyfriend, but admitted that L.A. Lakers superstar Kobe Bryant
figured prominently in answers on her questionnaire. What would
Earl bring with her to the ``Big Brother'' house? Kobe. How would
she use any fame she got from ``Big Brother''? To meet celebrities
like Kobe.
</P>
<P>
   (Unwittingly, Earl may have hit on a dirty little secret
</P>
<P>
   celebrities have created an American caste system, since they
only seem to commune with other celebrities; the rest of us dregs
have to consort with other dregs.)
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the house would likely be populated with some
antagonistic personalities, Earl said, ``I'm usually a nice person,
but if people act like a-holes, I'd be an a-hole back. They (the
show's producers) would get their confrontation.'' I admit I agree.
</P>
<P>
   I answered the question ``List three (3) items you would take
with you into the Big Brother House if allowed and why'' thusly:
</P>
<P>
   ``1.) Books, so I wouldn't have to interact with those other
bozos. 2.) A pamphlet of inspirational verse, so that I can comfort
others in an irksomely superficial fashion in times of woe. 3.) A
garrote: Just in case.''
</P>
<P>
   But I made, to my mind, a convincing pitch as to why I belonged
on the show in my audition tape. I explained the dramatic concept
of the ``Greek chorus'' (coming, I explained, from ancient theater
from some ancient land Greece, I believed) and, since I was
addressing illiterate TV executives, explained the literary conceit
of meta-fiction (roughly, a narrator's own self-consciousness while
telling a story).
</P>
<P>
   I further declared that, as a TV critic, I could review the show
as it took place and thereby create a new genre
</P>
<P>
   meta-non-fiction. And, since the show's creative conceits tended
to drag it from the narrow definition of ``reality,'' my commentary
on the series' very ``irreality'' would restore its truthfulness
and integrity. Plus, there'd be one at least nominally good review
they'd be assured.
</P>
<P>
   If I get called back for the next round of auditions
</P>
<P>
   and, heavens, given such compelling answers and arguments, don't
you think I will? we'll keep you posted.

 &HT;    SOCIAL SECURITY STANDS DRAW SHARP LINE BETWEEN GORE, BUSH
 &HT;    920&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories
for release Sunday, May 14.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The raging Social Security debate between Vice
President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas offers a clear
example of their differing philosophies of individual versus shared
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bush nor Gore has laid out a detailed Social Security
plan, but both have given a general outline of their positions.
Bush is expected to unveil his principles for reform Monday in a
speech in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Bush has indicated he would allow younger workers to
voluntarily divert a portion of the 12.4 percent payroll tax paid
by workers and employers _ perhaps two or three percentage points _
into privately controlled investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan promises no tax increases and full benefits to all
current retirees, although the basic benefit for future retirees
would have to be reduced. He also has not ruled out raising the age
for full retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The governor maintains that based on historic investment
returns, the young workers' gains would more than offset the cuts
in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, following President Clinton's lead, proposes using the
projected federal surplus to pay off the national debt and credit
those reductions to the Social Security trust fund. In addition,
Gore would also credit the fund with the interest savings resulting
from the reduced debt. He predicts that those actions would extend
the trust fund's life to at least 2050.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan also would increase benefits for widows and women
whose earnings levels were reduced because they stayed at home to
raise children.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore has backed away from an earlier Clinton proposal to
have the federal government invest 15 percent of the Social
Security surplus in private financial markets. Gore has said that
position, criticized by some who say it would give the government a
measure of control over private business, was only a suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and others call the Bush plan ``risky'' and warn it will
deplete the federal surplus. Critics of Gore's plan argue it does
nothing to reform the program and will eventually result in higher
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Before the argument is over, both sides will muster legions of
economists armed with graphs, charts and projections of how the
nation's retirement system could work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is essentially a debate over what the role of social
insurance is and should be, and what risks workers should
shoulder,'' said Henry J. Aaron, chairman of the National Academy
of Social Insurance and former chairman of the Advisory Council on
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   While both plans would change the nature of Social Security to
some extent, Gore has been on the political offensive recently
because Bush's plan would represent a more dramatic change in the
program.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since its creation in 1935, Bush's plan would
partially privatize Social Security by allowing workers to
personally invest a portion of their payroll taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Economists agree there is more individual risk in Bush's
approach because different people may choose different nvestments
and because market returns are not guaranteed. Critics also say the
change could erode the program's identity as a social insurance
program.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the risks are worth it because the potential
rewards are higher than the conservative investments made by the
current program in Treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
   In setting his course, Bush is certainly not alone. The partial
privatization route has long been trod by moderate and conservative
economists and research groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prudent thing to do is put aside savings today so 40 years
from now young people will be able to pay for a good portion of
their own benefits,'' said John C. Goodman, president of the
Dallas-based National Center for Policy Analysis.
</P>
<P>
   William Beach, director of the Heritage Foundation's Center for
Data Analysis, said, ``We look at reforming Social Security as a
way of reforming the tax most lower- and moderate-income people
face.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the partial privatization route solely a Republican
course. Several prominent Democrats, including Sens. Bob Kerrey of
Nebraska, John Breaux of Louisiana, and Chuck Robb of Virginia,
have offered versions of a partial privatization bill.
</P>
<P>
   Economists differ over the wisdom of a partial privatization
plan, also known as a ``carve-out'' because it carves a portion of
the payroll tax out of the public system.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, a bitterly divided Advisory Council on Social
Security split three ways, with five of the 13 members supporting a
5 percentage point carve-out for personal accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists who advocate a privatized approach argue that
real stock market returns have historically averaged about 7
percent a year, while Social Security offers a real rate of return
of about 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the partial privatization plan argue that in addition
to the obvious risks faced by individual investors, the approach
comes with hidden costs and implications.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron notes that since Bush's program would be aimed primarily
at younger workers, its impact would not begin to be felt for at
least a decade or more.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 75-year deficit in Social Security is equal to about
15 percent of the projected benefits, a 3 percentage point
carve-out would increase the deficit to about 33 percent, Aaron
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you are talking about is humongous cuts in assured
benefit income for middle-income Americans,'' Aaron said. ``I can
understand why Mr. Gore and others are rubbing their hands waiting
for the details from Mr. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Ron Gebhardtsbauer, (CQ) senior pension fellow for the American
Academy of Actuaries, notes that without huge benefit cuts, Bush's
plan would neither solve Social Security's long-range financial
problems nor reduce the federal debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He not only has not fixed Social Security's problem, he may
have created more,'' Gebhardtsbauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert D. Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute and
former director of the Congressional Budget Office, said a
2-percentage point carve-out would not produce enough income in
most cases to match what would be lost in guaranteed Social
Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political economist in me says (Bush) is committing
suicide. The policy analyst in me says I should take my hat off and
congratulate him for raising an important policy issue for this
century,'' Reischauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Economists also criticize Gore's plan because it does not
address Social Security's long-term financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   They're also uneasy because Gore's plan would eventually change
the nature of Social Security by using general revenues to help
finance the program instead of relying solely on payroll taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Paying down and eventually eliminating the federal debt _ the
heart of Gore's plan _ simply means it will be easier for the
government to borrow again in about 20 years when the Social
Security surplus is depleted by the retiring Baby Boomers.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the trust fund would become a pledge that the
federal government would have to honor either by using general
revenue or reducing benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Gebhardtsbauer estimates Gore's plan would eventually require
more than $100 billion a year from general revenues to help finance
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Using general revenue to pay Social Security benefits
``eliminates the discipline we've had since (President Franklin D.)
Roosevelt started it,'' Gebhardtsbauer said. ``That discipline is
that if you want to increase benefits, you have to increase
(payroll) taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Privatization supporters are even more critical of Gore's
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not doing anything is the real concern because we're on a path
that will require higher and higher taxes in the future,'' said
Goodman. ``Today's young people may not get all the benefits
promised because of resistance from future taxpayers who may not
even be born yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Beach, of the Heritage Foundation, is skeptical of Gore's
prediction that he can credit the debt reduction and interest
payment savings to Social Security and thereby keep the system
solvent until 2050. He suggests that the federal government will
find other ways to spend the money before it is needed for
retirement payments.

 &HT;    SOCIAL SECURITY STANDS DRAW SHARP LINE BETWEEN GORE, BUSH
 &HT;    920&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories
for release Sunday, May 14.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The raging Social Security debate between Vice
President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas offers a clear
example of their differing philosophies of individual versus shared
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bush nor Gore has laid out a detailed Social Security
plan, but both have given a general outline of their positions.
Bush is expected to unveil his principles for reform Monday in a
speech in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Bush has indicated he would allow younger workers to
voluntarily divert a portion of the 12.4 percent payroll tax paid
by workers and employers _ perhaps two or three percentage points _
into privately controlled investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan promises no tax increases and full benefits to all
current retirees, although the basic benefit for future retirees
would have to be reduced. He also has not ruled out raising the age
for full retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The governor maintains that based on historic investment
returns, the young workers' gains would more than offset the cuts
in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, following President Clinton's lead, proposes using the
projected federal surplus to pay off the national debt and credit
those reductions to the Social Security trust fund. In addition,
Gore would also credit the fund with the interest savings resulting
from the reduced debt. He predicts that those actions would extend
the trust fund's life to at least 2050.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan also would increase benefits for widows and women
whose earnings levels were reduced because they stayed at home to
raise children.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore has backed away from an earlier Clinton proposal to
have the federal government invest 15 percent of the Social
Security surplus in private financial markets. Gore has said that
position, criticized by some who say it would give the government a
measure of control over private business, was only a suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and others call the Bush plan ``risky'' and warn it will
deplete the federal surplus. Critics of Gore's plan argue it does
nothing to reform the program and will eventually result in higher
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Before the argument is over, both sides will muster legions of
economists armed with graphs, charts and projections of how the
nation's retirement system could work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is essentially a debate over what the role of social
insurance is and should be, and what risks workers should
shoulder,'' said Henry J. Aaron, chairman of the National Academy
of Social Insurance and former chairman of the Advisory Council on
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   While both plans would change the nature of Social Security to
some extent, Gore has been on the political offensive recently
because Bush's plan would represent a more dramatic change in the
program.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since its creation in 1935, Bush's plan would
partially privatize Social Security by allowing workers to
personally invest a portion of their payroll taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Economists agree there is more individual risk in Bush's
approach because different people may choose different investments
and because market returns are not guaranteed. Critics also say the
change could erode the program's identity as a social insurance
program.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the risks are worth it because the potential
rewards are higher than the conservative investments made by the
current program in Treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
   In setting his course, Bush is certainly not alone. The partial
privatization route has long been trod by moderate and conservative
economists and research groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prudent thing to do is put aside savings today so 40 years
from now young people will be able to pay for a good portion of
their own benefits,'' said John C. Goodman, president of the
Dallas-based National Center for Policy Analysis.
</P>

TV REVIEWER TRIES OUT FOR ``BIG BROTHER''
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
With sidebar slugged BROSIDE 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For CBS' upcoming summer program ``Big Brother'' (tagline: ``TV
has never been so real''), 10 guinea pigs _ er, sorry,
!ital!contestants _ will be chosen largely on the basis of their
ability to irritate one another.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, they will be stranded in a house with but two
bedrooms and one bathroom, in which hot water (and, no doubt,
toilet paper) will be strictly rationed.
</P>
<P>
   They'll have to grow their own vegetables and slaughter their
own chickens if they want to eat. They'll not be allowed to speak
to friends and family or, even, leave their narrow environs.
</P>
<P>
   They won't be allowed access to newspapers or TV or anything
that might give them an idea of what's going on elsewhere on their
planet (should global-nuclear warfare occur, they'll be the last to
know they're dead meat). They'll have their every embarrassing
behavior, their every idiotic utterance, captured by cameras and
disseminated to America via network television and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   They'll become symbols of a land's narcissism and an emerging
national hunch that one's life doesn't count unless it takes place
before TV cameras. They'll become regular jokes on Leno and
Letterman, and once their travails have concluded, they are likely
to slouch back into obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   All this begs the question: Just what kind of freaking moron
would even consider participating in this legalized torture?
</P>
<P>
   To find out, I showed up at the auditions at KCBS, application
in hand, a little after 7 p.m. last Wednesday. Since I had my
application already filled out, I immediately jumped to the front
of the line of 25 or so people. I spoke to some of the other
hopefuls as they exited the process.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Lenchner, a clinical psychologist/disc
jockey/professional street dancer (honest!), explained his
rationale for wanting to be on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm used to putting other people under scrutiny. I watch
people n my couch _ it's only fair to let people on their couches
watch me.''
</P>
<P>
   Given his varied careers, he added, ``I'm great at meeting
strangers _ I thought that my life is so interesting, it'd be good
for TV. How many other doctors do you know who are also hip-hop
performers?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Dre?'' I offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a licensed medical doctor,'' Lenchner pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a two-minute taped audition, aspirants must
contribute two photos and fill out an 11-page questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
   The questions run the gamut, from ``Have you ever been to a nude
beach?'' to ``Have you ever had a restraining order issued against
you? If so, tell us about it (include dates).''
</P>
<P>
   That one, of course, comes in the wake of Fox's abject
humiliation over the whole ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire?'' snafu, where the moneyed man in question had
apparently caused some grief to a former girlfriend. I offered as
my answer, ``Let's just say I've never been handed one.'' I figure,
they've hired some private investigators; let `em earn their keep.
</P>
<P>
   Other queries:
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``Have you ever had an interesting job?''
</P>
<P>
   A: ``TV critic; hence, no.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``What is your favorite movie?''
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Network.'' (For those with a limited sense of film history,
``Network'' is an Oscar-winning satire from 1976 decrying media
excesses which have all, in the quarter-century since the film's
release, become tame by TV2K standards. In other words, it was
simultaneously anticipating a show like ``Big Brother'' and finding
it absolutely reprehensible.)
</P>
<P>
   !folo!Q: ``Who is your hero and why?''
</P>
<P>
   !folo!A: ``Edgar Allan Poe, because he freed the slaves.''
(Note: I know, I know, but the one other time I was up to be on TV,
I was turned down because the producer said I was ``too erudite,''
and I didn't want that to be an issue here).
</P>
<P>
   !folo! Q: ``Describe your perfect day.''
</P>
<P>
   !folo!A: ``Waking up amidst nine other strangers under heavy,
virtually insane surveillance and exchanging superficial
pleasantries as these chuckleheads irritate me with their inane
chatter and doing a slow boil until about 7 p.m., when I reach for
my AK47 and silence the nattering brood. Why 7 p.m.? So the folks
at the local TV news can make it for their 11 p.m. broadcast.'' (I
concede it might give them pause for concern, but I think I prove
I'm a team player with my thoughtful gesture toward the TV news
media.)

THINGS GET INTERESTING, UGLY IN CROWDED HOUSE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
With BIGBRO 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's the good news that hit Spain's incarnation of the TV
sensation ``Big Brother,'' currently entering its third week on the
air: Within two weeks, two of the participants _ who had agreed to
spend 100 days locked in a house with eight other strangers under
the watchful eyes of a battery of cameras for the amusement of the
entire country _ had already begun a sizzling romance.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the bad news: The female half of that couple was voted
out by viewers in that second week.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, there's more good news: Her departure earned a
whopping 46 share, outdone only by its repeat on the weekly
highlights episode, which drew a staggering 75 percent of all
viewers watching TV. This was in no small part because her exit met
with a tearful farewell from her partner _ ``The man stood in the
doorway, crying, shouting, 'I want to marry you when I get out! I
love you so much!''' exults ``Big Brother'' executive producer Paul
Romer, who created the original series for Netherlands television.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how big a phenomenon ``Big Brother'' _ which will make
its American debut on CBS in July _ is in Spain: It beat out the
European soccer tournament in the ratings, something never before
achieved or even thought conceivable. It was a huge hit last year
in the Netherlands, and has been so far as well in Germany, where
the contestants are about two-thirds of the way through their run.
Given American audiences' fervor for reality programming, it could
well ace out ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' as the water-cooler
discussion topic of choice.
</P>
<P>
   America's ``Big Brother'' house is currently under construction
on the CBS Radford lot in Studio City. When it's up and running, 10
contestants selected from across the United States will enter the
house and commence being the subject of non-stop scrutiny for 100
days. Unlike ``MTV's The Real World,'' participants cannot leave
their premises to interact with the outside world. Every week or
so, one contestant (of two selected by a secret vote of the house's
inhabitants) will be voted out by viewers.
</P>
<P>
   It'll pay to be popular: The last surviving home dweller wins
$500,000; the runner-up $100,000. And, of course, individual
members can parlay as much fame and wealth from their participation
in the project as they can muster. When the Dutch series ended, the
winner went on to a part in a movie and numerous commercial
endorsements. The runner-up released his own CD; two women appeared
in Dutch Playboy magazine and another now co-hosts a weekly
entertainment program.
</P>
<P>
   When it premieres in July, ``Big Brother'' will be stripped
across the network's prime time schedule: A half-hour at 8 p.m.
every Monday, Tuesday and Friday; a live, hourlong broadcast in
which psychologists and participants' family members offer their
observations airs 8 p.m. Thursdays, along with an hourlong recap of
the week's events at 8 p.m. Saturdays. (CBS's other reality series,
``Survivor,'' will air on Wednesdays.) In addition, four different
Internet sites will stream non-stop material from the home 24 hours
a day. Though cameras will be set up in the house's bathroom,
that's simply for security reasons, Romer says (in case, say, a
participant has a heart attack); none of that material will air on
TV or the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Creator Romer admits the producers require a super-human
contribution from the participants, and says they emphasize to the
contestants how difficult life may be for them in the weeks leading
up to the broadcast date.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not very easy,'' he says. ``We made sure we prepared our
house guests as well as we could, psychologically as well as
physically. We told them everything they could expect for those
three months, and everything they could expect after. They were
aware of what was waiting for them. We didn't want to hide that
from them, we didn't want to give them a surprise. They were aware
of what they'd be facing. It's like preparing astronauts for a trip
to the moon _ we told them everything.''
</P>
<P>
   As for romantic encounters, Romer says, ``We don't really
encourage that, but they will be there. This show is about human
behavior, and relationships are part of that. We told married
people and people with partners _ we made them aware that over 100
days, people would fall in love, and that could affect their
private life. But when we were selecting the contestants, we were
looking for people who were open to possibilities, and counting on
the fact that some relationships will appear.'' To date, Romer
says, no marriages have been broken up by ``Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   If it isn't already, ``Big Brother'' is on the verge of becoming
a global phenomenon: After the U.S. start-up in July, nearly a
dozen more countries will begin similar programs in September,
including Italy, Switzerland and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   And those interested in applying for the American series can
still do so through May 12: Application forms and information are
available at CBS.com.

   For a dish that has been around almost as long as fire, pancakes
can be mucked up pretty easily. They can come out soggy in the
middle or too brown on top. They can be too thick or too thin. In
fact, it seems that pancakes seldom turn out just right. Goldilocks
had better luck with porridge.
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of better breakfasts, here are several ways to
make pancakes more dependable fare from Karen Dewey of Dewey's
Diner in Albany and ``The Bread Bible,'' by Beth Hensperger
(Chronicle Books, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   _ Pancake batter works best when mixed and then allowed to rest
in the refrigerator for a few hours because it gives the dry
ingredients time to dissolve into the moisture.
</P>
<P>
   _ All-purpose flour is the standard, but an equal amount of cake
flour can be used to make lighter, more airy pancakes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't get fussy when mixing. It's normal for there to be a few
lumps in the batter.
</P>
<P>
   _ There's no correct thickness to a pancake; it's whatever way
you like them. After all, crepes are just really thin pancakes with
extra eggs in them. The thinner the batter, the thinner the
pancake.
</P>
<P>
   _ Heat the skillet or griddle until a drop of water splashed on
the surface dances and sizzles. When the water has evaporated,
lightly grease the pan with oil or margarine.
</P>
<P>
   _ The first pancake always absorbs the excess grease in the pan,
so use it as a tester. Once it's cooked, decide if it's the correct
thickness. If it's too thin, add another spoonful of flour; too
thick, add a tablespoon or two of water.
</P>
<P>
   _ Depending on the recipe, pour no more than 1/3 cup of batter
onto the griddle for each pancake. Let cook until the top is all
bubbly and the edges of the pancake are dry. Cooking the first side
makes the pancake strong enough to flip easily and ensures the cake
is cooked through the center. Turning the pancakes too soon is one
of the most frequent mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   _ When the first side is cooked, turn the pancake to cook the
other side.
</P>
<P>
   _ If not serving the pancakes immediately, place them on a
paper-towel-lined baking pan, cover loosely with foil and hold in
an oven set at 200 degrees. Place more paper towels between layers
of pancakes to prevent them from becoming soggy.
</P>
<P>
   _ If serving immediately, slather them with butter right after
they come off the griddle.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pancakes can also be cooled to room temperature, frozen in a
single layer on a baking sheet and them stacked in freezer bags. To
reheat, microwave on high power for 15 seconds to 1 minute,
depending on how many you are heating, wrapped in a paper towel.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best thing about making pancakes is that you can add
just about anything to them. Add chopped pecans, berries, chopped
apples or dried cranberries before cooking. If everyone wants
something different, simply make a plain batter and sprinkle on the
extras right after scooping the batter into the pan.
</P>
<P>
   Savory pancakes make good dinners. Add scallions, grated
zucchini, rosemary, chopped ham, grated cheese, chives, corn or
peppers. For dessert, make them sweet with chocolate chips or
rum-soaked raisins. Or top them with cream cheese and jam or orange
segments simmered in sugar and a bit of Grand Marnier.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a basic pancake recipe to get you started. If you prefer,
use a mix.
</P>
<P>
   _ Buttermilk Pancakes
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   From ``The Bread Bible,'' by Beth Hensperger.
</P>
<P>
   2 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   Pinch salt
</P>
<P>
   2 1/4 cups buttermilk
</P>
<P>
   3 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons melted butter
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking soda and salt. In
another bowl, whisk the buttermilk, eggs and melted butter. Pour
the buttermilk mixture into the dry ingredients, stirring just
until moistened. Let rest for a few hours, refrigerated.
</P>
<P>
   Gently fold in any additional ingredients such as berries or
chocolate chips. Heat a griddle over medium heat until a drop of
water dances lightly across the surface and lightly grease it.
Using 1/4-cup measure for each pancake, pour the batter onto the
griddle. Cook until bubbles form on the surface, the edges are dry
and the bottoms are golden brown, 4 minutes. Turn once, cooking
again until the bottoms are golden, 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Zucchini-currant Pancakes
</P>
<P>
   Makes 12 pancakes
</P>
<P>
   From Bon Appetit, September, 1999
</P>
<P>
   2 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups buttermilk
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   3 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   1 medium zucchini, grated, squeezed to remove excess moisture
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup dried currants
</P>
<P>
   Additional vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   Butter
</P>
<P>
   Maple syrup
</P>
<P>
   Heat oven to 200 degrees. Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder,
baking soda, cinnamon, allspice and salt large bowl. Whisk
buttermilk, 3/4 cup oil and eggs in medium bowl. Add to dry
ingredients and mix just until blended but still lumpy. Fold in
zucchini and currants.
</P>
<P>
   Heat griddle or heavy large skillet over medium heat. Brush
lightly with vegetable oil. Working in batches, pour batter by 1/3
cupfuls onto griddle, spacing apart. Cook until bottoms are golden,
about 2 minutes. Turn and cook until second sides are golden and
pancakes are cooked through, about 2 minutes. Transfer to baking
sheet; keep warm in oven. Serve hot with butter and syrup.

   N.Y.-PALACE-PATIO (New York) _ A palace was not a palace without
a patio in the days of Don Pedro Fajardo y Chacon (circa
1478-1546), the Castilian nobleman who built the Castle of Velez
Blanco near the southeastern coast of Spain between 1506 and 1515.
By one of those happy sets of circumstances that often befall the
Metropolitan Museum, the Velez Blanco patio was installed in 1964.
The courtyard, closed for refurbishing in 1997, reopens Friday and
is closer than it has been in many years to its 16th-century self.

   NY-HOUSTON-STREET (New York) _ An elfin, top-hatted statue
perched high on a venerable red-brick building at Houston and
Lafayette streets leans over the sidewalk, holding a mirror above
the passing crowds. The gold-leaf figure is Puck, the playful
sprite of Shakespeare's ``Midsummer Night's Dream,'' whose
mischievous spirit animates the building that takes his name and
the scene below on which he muses. For along Houston Street, Puck,
who proclaims ``What fools these mortals be!,'' has a rich array of
humanity to marvel at _ finger-snapping jazz-hounds, 4 a.m. pool
sharks, dancing fools, fools waiting behind a velvet rope to start
dancing, very pregnant folk singers, walkers, poseurs from SoHo
(south of Houston), shoppers from NoHo (north of Houston),
gardeners, noshers, moviegoers of every stripe _ and a handful of
sinks for the bar and bathroom, if not the kitchen. If this be
folly, play on. By night and by day, for a river-to-river slice of
city life as varied and colorful as the mondo-maki fare at Mr.
Sushi, Houston Street is unrivaled. By Tina Kelly.

   &UR; EXAMINER INVESTIGATOR HAS LENGTHY RESUME &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients.) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By PETER HARTLAUB &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; .2000 San Francisco Examiner &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Charles B. Renfrew's resume is heavy reading. It
goes on for three pages, single-spaced, small type, documenting a
50-year professional career with highlights that include a federal
judgeship, an appointment as the U.S. deputy attorney general and
an executive post at Chevron.
</P>
<P>
   In his newest assignment in his hometown of San Francisco, the
former Army artilleryman will head an internal review of the
editorial policies of The Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Renfrew's appointment by The Hearst Corporation on Wednesday
came nine days after Publisher Timothy O. White testified that he
offered Mayor Willie Brown favorable treatment in the Examiner's
editorial pages in exchange for Brown's support of Hearst's plan to
buy the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   White is on an indefinite paid leave of absence pending the
outcome of the review.
</P>
<P>
   Following a high-profile arbitration job last year involving the
legal fees for a multibillion-dollar settlement by tobacco
companies, Renfrew is not likely to be overwhelmed by the
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of a better person they could get for it,'' said
U.S. District Judge William H. Orrick Jr., who has known Renfrew
since the 1950s. ``He's a straight arrow. Not a chance he'd be
caught up in the political maelstrom.''
</P>
<P>
   Renfrew, 71, released a short statement saying the review will
begin immediately, but said it would be ``premature'' to discuss
specifics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased to direct this important review process,''
Renfrew said. ``I am fully confident I have the cooperation of the
Hearst Corporation and the Examiner to conduct an open, independent
and unlimited review.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearst spokeswoman Debra Shriver said a number of people were
interviewed for the job over a short period of time. Renfrew was
chosen by James Asher, Hearst's chief legal officer for
development. Renfrew has no deadline to complete the review.
</P>
<P>
   Shriver said Wednesday morning that Renfrew may retain a
journalism expert to assist him. Shriver said later that it's only
a ``possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached at home, White said he found out about the appointment
while reading The Examiner on Wednesday afternoon, and was pleased
to learn that the Hearst Corp. found a jurist with Renfrew's
stature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is gratifying to see this moving ahead quickly,'' White
said. ``I am confident of the outcome and that my Hearst and
Examiner colleagues and I will be fully cleared of any
wrongdoing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearst Newspapers President George B. Irish , who declined to
comment on the Renfrew appointment Wednesday, will oversee
publishing duties at The Examiner until the investigation is
complete. He is expected to testify in the trial this week.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Renfrew has started investigating testimony that so
far has gotten more attention than any other portion of the
2-week-old trial of an antitrust lawsuit filed by Clint Reilly, who
is seeking to block the sale of the Chronicle to Hearst Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation will likely center around an Aug. 30, 1999,
lunch attended by White, Examiner Executive Editor Phil Bronstein
and Brown. White testified May 1, the first day of the trial, that
during the lunch, he offered more favorable treatment on The
Examiner's editorial pages in exchange for Brown's support.
</P>
<P>
   After the lunch, White sent an e-mail to Irish, stating: ``I
asked Willie how I was going to justify to my superiors in New York
wanting to support him and cooperate with him when he was seeming
to go out of his way to make our lives difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's lawyers later introduced part of a deposition
transcript that showed White giving similar testimony about the
Aug. 30 lunch to the U.S. Department of Justice last December, when
at least one Hearst lawyer was present.
</P>
<P>
   White has since said about his May 1 testimony that he was tired
and confused by the questioning, and that he did not offer Brown
favorable treatment in exchange for his support. Editorial page
editor James Finefrock wrote a letter to readers in Sunday's
Examiner, pledging that the editorial page ``is and has been
independent of any `horse trading' for favors from politicians or
anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's attorneys, who claim other Hearst executives must have
known about White's supposed deal with Brown, met the appointment
of Renfrew with skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are they going to investigate?'' Alioto said. ``The guy
said it on the stand - I don't know what else you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-counsel Daniel Shulman said he and Alioto met 21 years ago
during a case in Renfrew's court, on opposite sides in an antitrust
dispute involving several rental car companies.
</P>
<P>
   Later Alioto and Shulman were on the same side in a lawsuit
filed against Chevron Corp., where Renfrew acted as general
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Shriver said as far as she knew, Hearst Corp. had not hired
Renfrew before or had a case in his courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Renfrew, married with four children and five stepchildren, was
born in Detroit but has spent most of his life in San Francisco,
where colleagues say he has been active in his church.
</P>
<P>
   Renfrew was in the U.S. Navy from 1946 to 1948 and the Army from
1952 to 1953, finding time to get an undergraduate degree from
Princeton University in between. He got his law degree in 1956 from
University of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Renfrew was a U.S. district judge from 1972 to 1980, appointed
by President Richard Nixon. From 1980 to 1981 he served as deputy
U.S. attorney general, appointed by President Jimmy Carter. In 1983
he became vice-president of Chevron Corp. in charge of legal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   He has also worked as an arbitrator, a Boalt Hall School of Law
professor and has partnered in two San Francisco law firms _ most
recently from 1993 to 1997 at LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene &AMP; MacRae.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and colleagues say Renfrew is among the most respected
lawyers in the city. Orrick said Renfrew has been on ``everyone's
short list'' for the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Marilyn H. Patel said Renfrew is a humorous,
creative jurist whom she often recommends to mediate settlement
talks and other dispute resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you suggest his name, you don't get any objections,'' Patel
said.
</P>
<P>
   As Renfrew changed jobs often, he had at least one rough
transition.
</P>
<P>
   Critics tried to block his appointment as deputy attorney
general _ the No. 2 prosecutor spot in the nation _ claiming he
made statements in a law review article that discrimination against
Mexican and Asian Americans has not been as pervasive as bias
against other minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   Renfrew responded by pointing to his record promoting civil
rights, and later was confirmed for the appointment.
</P>
<P>
   He was also criticized after his appointment as a federal court
judge, when he called hearings at 7:30 a.m., hours before his
colleagues were getting started.
</P>
<P>
   Shulman declined to give his opinion of Renfrew, but said he
remembers the judge's rigorous schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he had some pretrial conferences on Saturday
morning,'' Shulman said.
</P>
<P>
   During his career, Renfrew has handled several high-profile
cases involving the media:
</P>
<P>
   _ As a federal judge in 1979, he fined newspaper Publisher John
McGoff $10,000 for not answering questions about the source of
funds for the purchase of the now-defunct Sacramento Union.
</P>
<P>
   _ As U.S. deputy attorney general in 1981, he settled the
investigation of leaks to reporters in the Abscam case by issuing
letters of reprimand. In the case, several officials were found to
have violated Department of Justice regulations by leaking to the
media details of a federal investigation into political corruption.
</P>
<P>
   _ As part of a three-member arbitration panel in 1988, he
ordered McClatchy newspapers to pay a casino owner $647,454 in
attorneys fees in an unsuccessful attempt to sue McClatchy
Newspapers for libel.

 &HT;    STATE GUN CHECKS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN FBI'S
 &HT;    For release Sunday, May 14.
 &HT;    BY SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Many states have a higher rate of blocking
ineligible persons from buying guns than the FBI, according to
state and federal statistics.
</P>
<P>
   These states succeed because they use a broader base of records
to conduct background checks _ including state criminal histories,
lists of people wanted for crimes, and mental health files.
</P>
<P>
   For example, last year the Georgia Bureau of Investigation
denied gun purchases last year to more than 14,000 people, or 6
percent of applicants, while the Florida Department of Law
Enforcement denied gun purchases to more than 6,000 people, or 2.5
percent of applicants.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the FBI rejected roughly 90,000 of the 4.5
million applications it processed, a rate of 2 percent, according
to a March report by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10 million instant background checks were conducted by
federal and state agencies last year. About half the checks were
conducted by the FBI, and the rest by states. Each check takes
about three minutes for an approval. Denials may take up to three
days.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, states do a better job ``because they often can
perform more thorough checks than the FBI,'' Attorney General Janet
Reno said in a March 14 letter to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI does not have access to some state records when
conducting background checks, said Daniel Welos, acting operations
manager for the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to get all the states' information and put it in
a national database that the FBI and other states can check,''
Welos said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their own records, states have access to federal
records, including files of people wanted by the FBI, Secret
Service files, immigration files and records of dishonorable
discharge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state checks are a better system,'' said Martha Wright,
chief of the User Services Bureau of the Florida Department of Law
Enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 15 states handle background checks on handguns and
``long guns'' such as rifles. Another 11 states conduct handgun
checks and leave long-gun approvals to the FBI. For states that
don't conduct checks _ including the District of Columbia and U.S.
territories _ the FBI has been handling them since November 1998
under the Brady Act.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their successes, the state background checks are in
jeopardy. That's because it costs states more money to do the
checks than they receive in fees. Florida charges gun dealers $8
for each check, while it costs the state $8 to $10 apiece to
research the application. Last year, Florida conducted more than
240,000 background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Florida and other states have appealed to Congress to help them
pay for the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without this funding, it is unlikely that state legislatures
will continue the state programs,'' Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida warned
last year in a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI does not charge dealers a fee for checks. Instead, it
receives an annual appropriation from Congress to operate the
system. The FBI spent $40 million on checks last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department supports the states' effort to get more
money from Congress to run the background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the ranking Democrat on the Senate
Judiciary Committee, added an amendment to the juvenile justice
bill last year to earmark $40 million to the states for checks. The
bill has been tied up in a conference with the House since last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The instant background checks do not yet apply to guns sold at
gun shows or to dealers that are not registered with the federal
government.

&HT;     S.F. NEWSPAPER EXECUTIVE TELL HOW HE USED INSIDER'S TIP 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SETH ROSENFELD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The head of the company that prints San
Francisco's daily newspapers has testified that he passed to Hearst
Corp. executives in New York a warning from some members of the
Chronicle board of directors that they better act quickly if they
wanted to buy the morning paper.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination, Steven B. Falk, president of the San
Francisco Newspaper Agency, said he passed along the tip he
received from Alan H. Nichols Jr., who was then on the Chronicle
board.
</P>
<P>
   Falk said Nichols, then chief financial officer of the Chronicle
Publishing Co., indicated that Hearst should make a fast bid for
the Chronicle before some of its owners sold other properties and
decided to keep the paper.
</P>
<P>
   In a booming voice, attorney Joseph M. Alioto asked, ``Did Mr.
Nichols tell you in sum or substance that the Hearst Corporation
should act quickly because the Chronicle family members might find
themselves flush with cash and decide to keep the Chronicle?''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was that indication, yes,'' said Falk.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony came in former mayoral candidate Clint Reilly's
antitrust suit to block Hearst from buying the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Falk was a key witness for Hearst and the Chronicle as they
began their defense to Reilly's complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto claimed outside of court that the information passed by
Nichols had been meant to thwart Chronicle shareholders who wanted
to keep the 135-year-old paper in family hands. Nan Tucker McEvoy,
a major shareholder and former board chair, had once declared the
Chronicle would be sold ``over my dead body.''
</P>
<P>
   Nichols, now president of Mountain View Internet firm Geocast,
could not be reached for comment Wednesday. Falk denied that there
was anything wrong in the communication between him, Nichols and
the Hearst Corp. So did Gregory Lindstrom, a Chronicle lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Falk runs the San Francisco Newspaper Agency, created in 1965 to
oversee a joint operating agreement between Hearst, which owns The
Examiner, and the local Chronicle Publishing Co.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Falk's agency collects all revenue, and
handles all printing, circulation and marketing for both papers.
After paying for the joint operations, the agency splits the
remainder evenly between each paper, which pays the costs of its
independent editorial staff.
</P>
<P>
   Joint operating agreements are allowed under the 1970 Newspaper
Preservation Act, an exception to antitrust laws meant to keep
alive newspapers that otherwise might fail so communities could
benefit from multiple editorial voices.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco agreement was set to expire in 2005, but the
Chronicle's owners last year decided to sell to Hearst for $660
million.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's suit claims Hearst's plans to buy the Chronicle and
sell The Examiner to the Fang family, publishers of the
thrice-weekly San Francisco Independent, would create an illegal
newspaper monopoly that would reduce editorial and economic
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly contends Hearst's agreement to give the Fangs a subsidy
of up to $66 million over three years to offset costs of publishing
The Examiner is a sham, because it is not enough to make the paper
a viable competitor to the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst has denied the allegations and claims The Examiner could
not survive outside its profit-splitting agreement. Since it is a
failing enterprise, Hearst may legally shut or sell it and buy the
Chronicle, Hearst says.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Halling, a Hearst lawyer, put Falk on the stand in an
effort to prove The Examiner would fail outside the agreement and
that the surviving Chronicle would still face fierce competition
for some of the $1.3 billion in advertising in the 11 Bay Area
counties.
</P>
<P>
   Falk testified that the two San Francisco dailies are in the
middle of one of the nation's most competitive media markets, and
face competition for advertising and readers from a dozen suburban
papers as well as television, radio, cable and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Key competition comes from Knight Ridder, the newspaper chain
that owns the San Jose Mercury News and the Contra Costa Times, and
which Falk called ``the evil empire.''
</P>
<P>
   Falk said The Examiner's and Chronicle's joint operating
agreement crippled the larger Chronicle, which in effect subsidizes
The Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   On cross-examination, though, Alioto forced Falk to concede that
the agency has no actual figures that separate the shared revenue
and costs of each paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no measurement specifically,'' said Falk.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto turned to a June 22, 1999, e-mail that he said showed
Falk had passed inside information from Chronicle director Nichols
to Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   In it, George Irish, head of Hearst's newspaper division, told
Hearst President Frank Bennack Jr.: ``Today, Steve Falk relayed a
conversation he had with Dick Rosenberg, who was in the Chronicle
board meeting about the discussion on the decision to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rosenberg told Steve that they . . . ended up with the
expectation that Hearst would make their best offer very quickly,
instead of waiting until all the other offers were in . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick told Steve that there is still a great deal of
longstanding dislike of Hearst among some of the shareholders and a
strong offer up front could lead to their acceptance without the
longer process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve told me that Rosenberg opined that if we waited until
the end of the process, they may find themselves flush with cash
and decide to keep the Chronicle,'' Irish wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Falk testified that he never spoke with Rosenberg, and that
Nichols had dropped by his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a somewhat casual hallway conversation,'' Falk said,
``though it was clear to me the message . . . was . . . Rosenberg
and other board members are hoping Hearst steps up to the plate in
an aggressive way quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Irish happened to phone Falk the next day, and Falk passed the
hint along without mentioning Nichols as the source, he testified.
</P>
<P>
   When Falk testified that he didn't recall the exact words of his
talk with Nichols because it was not a major event, Alioto was at
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You say not a major event! You have the chief financial
officer giving you inside information about what's going on in the
board of directors meeting of the Chronicle, the competitor of the
Hearsts, with regard to the sale of the Chronicle, you say that was
not something that was of great moment to you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right,'' said Falk. ``I believed Nichols was doing his
job. I think Alan was being a very savvy CFO. His mission was, I
believe, to get the highest price he could for the Chronicle, for
his board and for his shareholders, and I think he thought if he
dropped a little bit of information in the right place, that word
may just get back to where it might do some good.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Alioto said, ``which means the executive offices in New
York of Hearst, right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' said Falk.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto has contended that Hearst abused its position within the
joint operating agreement to get the Chronicle at lower than market
price.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst and the Chronicle have denied that.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's testimony began with Michael Weaver, a consultant to
Reilly and former chief financial officer of the Orange County
Register.
</P>
<P>
   After Hearst in March decided to sell The Examiner to the Fangs,
Weaver wrote Reilly: ``There is no doubt that the Fangs can and
will put out a paper for less than $25 million per year in net
costs to themselves during the three years of Hearst subsidy; cream
as much off the top for themselves and the Independent as they can;
and then either merge the papers or close their `money losing
venture.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a pretty picture for the competitive newspaper situation
in San Francisco,'' Weaver wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning by Christopher Hockett, a Fang lawyer, Weaver
admitted knowing nothing of the Fangs' plans for The Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Hearst retained former U.S. District Judge
Charles B. Renfrew to review ``editorial policies`` at The Examiner
and whether suspended Examiner Publisher Timothy O. White violated
journalistic ethics by offering Mayor Willie Brown favorable
treatment in The Examiner's opinion pages in exchange for Brown's
support of Hearst's plan to buy the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Chronicle and Hearst asked Walker on Wednesday
to dismiss Reilly's suit, saying he lacks legal standing to bring
it because he has shown no injury from Hearst's plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, Mr. Reilly apparently does not have enough of a stake
in his own case even to testify,'' said Halling. ``Number two, Mr.
Reilly, who purports to be trying to save The Examiner, is not even
a subscriber to The Examiner.''
</P>
<P>
   Alioto claims Reilly has standing to sue as a consumer of both
papers who would suffer higher subscription and advertising rates
if Hearst gets the alleged monopoly ownership of the Chronicle, and
as a private attorney general protecting the public.

&HT;     STEALING HOME TAKES SOME THOUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Think about your career in terms of baseball for
a minute. You're on second base, and a teammate singles to center
field. As you run toward third, you look at the coach for a sign:
Should you stop at third or head for home? But all he does is stare
blankly at you.
</P>
<P>
   What should you do? Answer the question now, based only on the
information you've been given.
</P>
<P>
   If you're still at third base, ask yourself a second question:
Are you stifling your own career? And if you're a boss, think about
whether your workers would answer the question the same way you
would.
</P>
<P>
   There is no absolutely right or wrong answer to the baseball
question, any more than there are absolutely right or wrong answers
in the workplace. But here are some things to consider:
</P>
<P>
   _ Know your default position.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, you could have asked a bunch of other questions before
answering the baseball question. But no matter how many questions
you asked, a lot of what you did would depend on your instincts as
the situation unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   A good manager would never have left you in this quandary, of
course. Players would have been told that you keep running hard
unless a coach stops you, so you would have headed for home without
giving it a second thought.
</P>
<P>
   But not all managers in the workplace give explicit
instructions. You have to decide for yourself whether to wait
silently for directions, ask for advice or rely on your instincts.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a third-base coach will wait as long as possible
before giving a signal. Runners who appear tentative are a lot more
likely to get stopped than those who are blasting away at full
speed. The tentative ones have already lost a step or two, and
that's enough to sway the coach.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing happens in the workplace. Workers who exude
confidence are more likely to get waved ahead; those who have to
ask permission for everything are destined to spend an eternity at
third base, if they get that far.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't underestimate how much you know.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of baseball players can become so dependent on the coach
that they forget to keep track of obvious things, such as the score
of the game, how many outs there are, where the outfielders are
positioned and how well each of them can throw.
</P>
<P>
   You also should know your own reputation. If your nickname is
Rabbit and the coach doesn't put up the stop sign, you can feel
pretty safe about heading home. On the other hand, if your nickname
is The Piano Mover, you might want to stop at third. And get some
oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   One good side effect from all the layoffs in the last decade is
that fewer bosses are micromanagers. They simply don't have the
time to yammer at you about every step you should take to do your
job.
</P>
<P>
   That is not good news, however, for those workers who would
instinctively stop at third base. If you're passive about your
career path, waiting for that big assignment to come your way and
assuming that your boss knows how well you're doing, you'll
probably be disappointed. The good assignments go to those who know
how to take the extra base.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the things you do know. Many people are most effective
at particular times of day. Does your job let you take maximum
advantage of those times? Could you change your hours so that it
did?
</P>
<P>
   Would you be better off leaving the office at 1 p.m. each day,
taking a two-hour nap, then finishing your work at home? Would you
be more focused if you ignored all phone calls between 10 a.m. and
noon so you could work uninterrupted? Would trading certain job
duties with a colleague make both of you more effective?
</P>
<P>
   You'll know the answers to those questions better than your boss
will. If you seem to be hitting your stride as you're rounding
third base, a lot of bosses won't stop you.
</P>
<P>
   _ Expect to make a few outs.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you have a wonderful and alert third-base coach,
sometimes you're going to get thrown out. If you made it safely
every time, you and the coach would be playing it too cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   Your boss is going to disagree with you from time to time, and
you might even wind up in serious trouble once in a while. But if
you usually make smart choices and your intentions were good, no
boss with half a brain will be too disappointed in you. As a boss,
you want workers whose biggest fault is being a little too
ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sometimes the smartest play is playing dumb.
</P>
<P>
   This ought to come with a ``Kids: Don't try this at home''
label, but here goes: If you're a good worker and you want to try
something your boss probably won't like, sometimes it's best to
just try it without asking permission. When you get caught, make it
sound as if all you did was follow the obvious path.
</P>
<P>
   If you ask permission, get turned down and try it anyway, that's
insubordination and could get you in serious trouble. But if you
just try it and then the boss finds out, the trouble won't be as
severe. And if a few weeks passed and your strategy seemed to work,
you just might get away with it.
</P>
<P>
   Remember: This advice applies only if you're already a
well-respected worker, and you have to have a logical business
reason for doing what you did. ``Gee, I thought you wanted me to
take that $2 million and go to Tahiti'' probably won't cut it. On
the other hand, ``After I was done with the client, it just made
more sense for me to finish the work at home instead of driving all
the way back to the office'' just might.
</P>
<P>
   A good manager won't be all that bothered by a well-intentioned
mistake, even if you get caught trying to steal home.

   N.Y.-PALACE-PATIO (New York) _ A palace was not a palace without
a patio in the days of Don Pedro Fajardo y Chacon (circa
1478-1546), the Castilian nobleman who built the Castle of Velez
Blanco near the southeastern coast of Spain between 1506 and 1515.
By one of those happy sets of circumstances that often befall the
Metropolitan Museum, the Velez Blanco patio was installed in 1964.
The courtyard, closed for refurbishing in 1997, reopens Friday and
is closer than it has been in many years to its 16th-century self.

   NY-HOUSTON-STREET (New York) _ An elfin, top-hatted statue
perched high on a venerable red-brick building at Houston and
Lafayette streets leans over the sidewalk, holding a mirror above
the passing crowds. The gold-leaf figure is Puck, the playful
sprite of Shakespeare's ``Midsummer Night's Dream,'' whose
mischievous spirit animates the building that takes his name and
the scene below on which he muses. For along Houston Street, Puck,
who proclaims ``What fools these mortals be!,'' has a rich array of
humanity to marvel at _ finger-snapping jazz-hounds, 4 a.m. pool
sharks, dancing fools, fools waiting behind a velvet rope to start
dancing, very pregnant folk singers, walkers, poseurs from SoHo
(south of Houston), shoppers from NoHo (north of Houston),
gardeners, noshers, moviegoers of every stripe _ and a handful of
sinks for the bar and bathroom, if not the kitchen. If this be
folly, play on. By night and by day, for a river-to-river slice of
city life as varied and colorful as the mondo-maki fare at Mr.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Turning to an able administrator who long served in
the Vatican, Pope John Paul II reached into the relatively small
diocese of Bridgeport, Conn., and named Bishop Edward M. Egan as
New York's ninth archbishop Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Egan succeeds Cardinal John O'Connor, a man who apparently did
not favor him much for the job, and will take over as the nation's
most visible and powerful Catholic leader. O'Connor died on May 3
at the age of 80.
</P>
<P>
   Egan will undoubtedly receive the red hat of a cardinal,
traditional for the New York archbishop.
</P>
<P>
   The clergyman, 68, is widely viewed as an interim leader, given
that bishops are required to submit their resignations to the pope
at age 75. The pope had asked O'Connor to stay on after he
submitted his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday held near the Midtown Manhattan
headquarters of the archdiocese, Egan said, ``My first reaction
was, `Edward, get down on your knees and thank the Lord to give you
a hand, and don't get up too quickly.'''
</P>
<P>
   Egan is known for turning around a troubled diocese, his talent
for bolstering the priesthood and his expertise in canon law, but
he has little experience as a parish priest. He is a theological
conservative in the image of the pope, who has filled the ranks of
bishops around the world with like-minded men.
</P>
<P>
   After eight days of speculation that Egan would be chosen _
thanks in part to comments by family members that he had the job _
the announcement came as it normally does: a dry statement and
short biography included in the Vatican's daily press bulletin. His
installation is scheduled for June 19.
</P>
<P>
   The New York archbishop presides over 2.4 million Catholics in
the country's second-largest archdiocese after Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Egan, who said he had known about his
appointment for two weeks, revealed little of his plans for the
archdiocese, saying he had much to learn.
</P>
<P>
   But he disclosed his leanings on some issues.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he left open the possibility of closing parochial
schools if necessary. ``There are times when you have no choice,
and can't pay the bills,'' he said. And he said parents should have
the choice of schools for their children without having to pay
``double,'' an apparent reference to support for school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his stand on any potential anti-discrimination
law in New York regarding sexual orientation, he said: ``Stay
tuned, sir. You will find out in a couple of months.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no real surprises on questions of doctrine or church
teaching, and he reiterated his opposition to contraception and
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Egan immediately sought to convey a sense of humility regarding
his new assignment, while reaching out to his future flock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you I know no place in the world that is quicker to
accept someone who wants to be a New Yorker,'' he said. ``And I
want to be a New Yorker.'' The bishop also showed a certain
political acuity: ``Perhaps Mrs. Clinton could give me some advice
about being a New Yorker,'' he said, a barbed reference to Hillary
Rodham Clinton's recent move to New York in order to run for a
Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   The bishop also expressed sympathy for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
who on Wednesday announced he was separating from his wife and last
week announced that he has prostate cancer. ``He has my prayers,''
the bishop said.
</P>
<P>
   He also sought to cast a good light on his relationship with
O'Connor, saying several times they had no differences regarding
Catholic education. But he did not make a general statement about
their relationship until the end of his answer, when he said: ``We
had a wonderful relationship. He was very supportive.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The tall, deep-voiced bishop strove to maintain a jovial
attitude with scores of reporters, often chiding them for speaking
too softly or too quickly, and he spoke a few words of Italian to a
journalist for an Italian church newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   But Egan hinted that he is not all humility. ``I don't feel like
a boss, but give me a little time and I will,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He will certainly need more than humility as archbishop of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a position of deep influence and power in the American
church, whoever sits in that seat,''said Chester Gillis, an
associate professor of theology at Georgetown University in
Washington, D.C., who focuses on the U.S. church and its relations
with Rome. ``It means that other leaders in the church certainly
would have to consult with the archbishop of New York. He would
yield significant power in the National Council of Bishops.''
</P>
<P>
   And nothing matches New York's combination of fast pace, media
attention and economic and political influence _ all of which call
for a man with force of personality, with which O'Connor was richly
endowed.
</P>
<P>
   Egan is no stranger to that world, though the media spotlight
has been relatively faint in Bridgeport, a diocese of 360,000
people where he served as bishop for 12 years. O'Connor, too, came
from an obscure posting _ Scranton, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Egan's age and background as a teacher and expert in canon law _
a traditional route to the top of the Catholic hierarchy _ would
likely lead to a less high-profile way of directing the
archdiocese, said the Rev. John Langan, a professor in the
Georgetown philosophy department.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an affirmation of conservative continuity, but in a lower
key and with a much less public style,'' Langan said. ``One of the
interesting questions is what his energy level will be like. This
is the kind of job that can devour several 40-year-old men.''
</P>
<P>
   Egan served as an auxiliary bishop in New York from 1985 to 1988
in the post of vicar of education. When he was named auxiliary,
O'Connor made clear in a letter to diocesan priests that the man
was not his choice.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Egan's name figure on a list of three recommendations
given to the pope, according to a church official familiar with the
process. O'Connor likely would have had some influence on those
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   As vicar for education in New York, Egan did not limit himself
to Catholic schools. He also spoke out about public schools,
appearing at a 1987 City Council hearing to criticize a proposal to
distribute contraceptives in high school health clinics. ``Try
decency. Try chastity. Try Western civilization,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the marks he made in Bridgeport, local Catholics say, was
on education.
</P>
<P>
   When he took over in 1988, the diocese was deeply in debt, and
schools as well as churches in poorer neighborhoods were struggling
as immigrant Catholic populations of Lithuanians, Slovaks, Poles
and Italians dwindled.
</P>
<P>
   Egan imposed shared financing of the schools, requiring that
wealthier sections of the diocese like Greenwich, Danbury and
Westport help to fund impoverished areas. He also closed several
dilapidated or poorly attended schools.
</P>
<P>
   And overall finances improved. Under Egan, a fund-raising
campaign begun in 1995 has so far brought in $28 million, with $15
million more in pledges.
</P>
<P>
   With much of the world, and particularly the United States,
suffering a shortage of priests, Egan won attention for producing
an unusually large number of priests in his diocese.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference Thursday, the bishop cited the increase
in priests as one of his main accomplishments in Bridgeport, and
held up one of his business cards, which have the address of a
residence for young men contemplating the priesthood on the back.
He said he passes them out liberally.
</P>
<P>
   Egan was born in Oak Park, Ill., in 1932, and was ordained as a
priest at 25. He worked only briefly in a parish. He has a
bachelor's degree in philosophy from St. Mary of the Lake Seminary
in Mundelein, Ill., and completed seminary studies at the
Pontifical North American College in Rome. He received a doctorate
in canon law from the Pontifical Gregorian University, also in
Rome.
</P>
<P>
   He later spent 14 years as a judge on the Sacred Roman Rota, the
Vatican's highest tribunal, which hears appeals on matters of
church law, especially annulments of marriages. He also taught
judicial practice at the Gregorian. Egan was one of six canon law
experts chosen to review the updated Code of Canon Law, issued in
1983, for Pope John Paul II.

&HT;     LAWMAKERS REJECT CALIF. GOVERNOR'S EFFORT TO WEAKEN AN HMO
REFORM
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Democrats in the California legislature have
rejected an attempt by Gov. Gray Davis to water down a cornerstone
of the landmark HMO reforms he signed into law last year: the right
for patients to sue their HMOs to recover medical costs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law, HMO patients can skip a critical bureaucratic
step and quickly sue their HMOs if they suffer ``significant
financial harm'' because they were denied medical treatment. Only a
few states have given HMO patients the right to sue to recover
medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   Some HMO patients have drained their bank accounts or sold their
homes to pay for treatment after being denied coverage by an HMO.
Many personal bankruptcies in the United States result from huge
medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   But only months after signing the new law, Davis started working
to eliminate the ``significant financial harm'' requirement. The
Democratic governor's proposed change would have allowed quick
lawsuits against an HMO only when the patients' physical safety,
not their pocketbook, is in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else who wants to sue an HMO must undergo a
state-supervised independent review of his or her case before going
to court.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly Judiciary Committee rejected a measure Tuesday that
would have amended the law to make it closer to what Davis wants.
The landmark reforms stay - for now - the same as approved by the
governor last year.
</P>
<P>
   The bill got only three ``yes'' votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legislature said it was not going to amend a bill before
the ink is dry,'' said Jaime Court, a lobbyist with the Foundation
for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, which is partly funded by trial
lawyers. ``This was the legislature saying it was going to
implement its own vision when it comes to HMO reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Davis said he would continue to press the
legislature to change the law, despite Tuesday's setback.
</P>
<P>
   Court and other consumer advocates said the governor's proposed
changes ``would have given patients a lot shorter stick in dealing
with HMOs,'' effectively gutting the original measure that Davis
hailed as historic when he signed it in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply put, the whole point of this right and the HMO
liability laws passed last year is to provide the strongest
possible incentive for the HMOs to do the right thing the first
time out,'' said Sara Nichols, director of the nonprofit
Neighbor-to-Neighbor health care advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill would cut back on that incentive and would place
patients in an impossible position.''
</P>
<P>
   Maureen E. O'Haren, a lobbyist with the California Association
of Health Plans, said sending these disputed cases to an
independent review instead of directly to court didn't mean the HMO
patient wouldn't be able to recover money from the HMO.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think people should pursue this process,'' O'Haren said.
``It's available. It's speedy, and it gets them what they need as
soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Judiciary Committee Chairwoman Sheila Kuehl, D-Santa
Monica, co-author of last year's bill, said she had told the
governor she was adamant about keeping financial harm in the law.
But she agreed to carry the new bill this session to address Davis'
concern that patients could ``game'' the system by paying out of
pocket for medical care to avoid the independent review otherwise
required, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She reminded her committee she would vote ``yes'' on her revised
bill. But it failed despite a large majority of Democrats on the
panel.

A VICIOUS FIGHT CASTS ITS SHADOW 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ Dozens of students picked up caps and gowns
at Providence College on a sun-drenched afternoon last week, while
others flipped a Frisbee across a lawn. But as students scurried to
classes and prepared for final exams, an ugly incident hovered over
this small Catholic school, tarnishing the otherwise idyllic
end-of-semester scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Eight basketball players were involved in a brutal fight with
three other Providence students one evening last month that left
two students lying bloodied on the ground and in need of
reconstructive facial surgery, according to the police.
</P>
<P>
   The incident has angered many of the 3,700 Providence students
and disappointed administrators, and it also threatens to decimate
a once-proud basketball program that twice has been to the Final
Four. The Providence Friars have been a primary source of pride,
inspiration and entertainment for people in this area for half a
century, but they are scrambling right now just to find enough
players to fill next season's roster.
</P>
<P>
   As many as six players, at least three of whom were projected to
be starters, could be lost from next season's team as a result of
the fight. Much will depend on the outcome of criminal cases and
college disciplinary proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the basketball players have been charged with assault
for their roles in the fight. Those players, along with the four
others, have already been punished by a college discipline
committee; each of the eight players was expelled, suspended or
placed on disciplinary probation. School officials declined to
discuss details of the punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The eight players have appealed the discipline committee's
findings, and they remain on campus to take final exams this week
and await the completion of their appeals, which is expected soon.
</P>
<P>
   If the penalties are upheld, none of the players would be
eligible to play here next season. Six of the eight had intended to
return, but even students on probation are not permitted to play on
a Providence College team.
</P>
<P>
   And since Providence has a recent history of enforcing strict
penalties against other students found to have violated college
rules, two people familiar with the appeals process said it
appeared unlikely that the penalties would be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   If they are not, the basketball coach, Tim Welsh, might have
only four scholarship players returning from a listless 11-19 team.
But Welsh is trying to be optimistic in the midst of the
embarrassing ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Providence College basketball has been around for many, many
years,'' Welsh said. ``This was an unfortunate incident. We all
have to learn from it and move forward. But the program is not
going to go under because of something that happened in 10
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight took place on a chilly Monday evening, April 10, after
the players had gone to the apartment of Thomas Cook, a senior, at
47 Eaton St., just a few hundred feet off campus. Cook works as a
bouncer at Prime Time Cafe, a brick-faced bar about a mile off
campus, where lines of students wait to get in on many nights.
</P>
<P>
   Cook had helped remove David Murray, a 6-foot-9-inch center from
New York City, from Prime Time three days earlier, because Murray,
22, did not have valid identification, said Maj. Martin Hames,
chief of detectives for the city police. Some shoving occurred as
Murray was forced to leave the bar, Hames said.
</P>
<P>
   Several players spent the weekend trying to find Cook, Hames
said, to confront him about what they considered a lack of respect.
The players arrived at the tan-and-white three-story house where
Cook lives at about 10:30 p.m. The police said that Murray and two
other basketball players _ Donta Wade and Llewellyn Cole _ punched
and kicked Cook. He was found in the driveway disoriented, and he
needed surgery to repair a fractured jaw and a broken nose.
</P>
<P>
   Wade was also charged with hitting Mark Hogan, another
Providence student. He needed surgery to repair injuries to his
cheekbone and his eye socket and a metal plate had to be inserted
in his face, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth player, Jamaal Camah, was charged with punching another
college student who lives at the house, Ryan Kerwin.
</P>
<P>
   Although the players are all African-American and the injured
students are white, many students and others with ties to the
college insisted that the incident was not racially motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, Wade and Cole have been charged with multiple counts of
felony assault, assault with a deadly weapon and conspiracy to
commit felony assault. The deadly weapons were the shoes apparently
used to kick the injured students. The fourth player, Camah, was
charged with one count of assault. They all pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Cole, a 6-foot-7-inch forward from New York City, was the only
senior on the team and will obviously not be back. But the other
three are juniors who had been expected to start for the Friars
next season: Wade, a 6-2 guard who had a 38-point game against
Notre Dame last season; Murray, the 6-9 center, and Camah, a 6-4
guard.
</P>
<P>
   John C. Revens Jr., who is Cole's lawyer, and Daniel McKinnon,
Murray's lawyer, disputed the police's version of the events,
although each declined to offer specifics.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of the players said they had gone to Cook's house to
retrieve a gold necklace that Murray had lost in the jostling with
Cook at Prime Time on April 7. Murray had not been allowed into the
bar, the friend said, because he did not have an ID, but he had
somehow slipped inside. Cook helped to eject him and, in the
pushing that took place outside the bar, Murray apparently lost a
necklace, the friend said.
</P>
<P>
   When Murray and seven teammates went to Cook's house three days
later to retrieve the necklace, the players were told that Cook was
not home, the friend said. They were walking the short distance
back to the campus when Cook and several other students confronted
them. Both sides started arguing, the friend said, and Wade and
Cook wound up squaring off, beginning the skirmish that left Cook
and Hogan seriously injured and the basketball program in shambles.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a fight,'' Revens, Cole's lawyer, said. ``There's no
dispute about that. As to where the fight occurred and how it
occurred, there will be a dispute about that.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon, Murray's lawyer, said the fight was ``substantially
more complicated'' than has been reported by the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who might appear, at first blush, to be the
aggressors might prove to be the people who started to retreat,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Providence College has not released the names of the
players involved in the fight because of federal privacy laws,
Wade, Cole, Murray and Camah were arraigned in District Court on
April 14. A Big East Conference official confirmed that the other
four students who accompanied them to Eaton Street are also
basketball players.
</P>
<P>
   College officials declined requests for interviews, and some
students involved in the incident did not respond to interview
requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been extremely careful about not saying anything until
the appeal process is completed,'' said Edward Caron, the vice
president for college relations and planning.
</P>
<P>
   Welsh, a former Iona coach who just finished the second year of
a seven-year contract, might be left with only the remnants of a
team that was one of the worst in the Big East last season.
</P>
<P>
   Welsh said he would meet with students, alumni and fans for ``20
hours a day,'' if necessary, to restore faith in the program, but
the 39-year-old coach and the team are obviously in a dire
situation.
</P>
<P>
   The Friars appeared in the Final Four in 1973, when Ernie
DiGregorio was making fancy passes to Marvin Barnes, and in 1987,
when Rick Pitino was climbing to coaching prominence with a future
coach on the court named Billy Donovan. The school boasts of former
players like Lenny Wilkens and John Thompson and former coaches
like Joe Mullaney and Dave Gavitt.
</P>
<P>
   While many Providence students were reluctant to discuss the
fight and the basketball players, some were outspoken. ``It's a
ridiculous situation,'' said David Tanski, a freshman. ``They
should be kicked out of school and put in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Welsh said, ``If certain people need to be penalized, they
will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Burke, another freshman, said: ``The glory days of
Providence basketball are behind us. That's why I think they should
just get rid of these kids and start fresh. Maybe they can make it
back. They've done it before. You can do it easier these days. You
only need a couple of kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Welsh might need more than that just to hold a
scrimmage. Since Providence could have as few as four returning
players to go along with four high school recruits, Welsh is
pursuing several junior college players and preparing for the
worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more determined than ever,'' he said. ``We're faced with
this and now we have to figure a way out. It's not something I'm
just saying to you, I truly believe it. It's not like we're coming
off a Final Four year. I like the kids coming back. I'm not saying
it's going to be a great time.''
</P>
<P>
   Some students speculated that because the players were used to
receiving preferential treatment, from having full scholarships to
getting early choices in classes and dormitories, they responded
aggressively when something went against them.
</P>
<P>
   But another student noted that the players are taught teamwork
throughout their careers and perhaps followed that approach while
trying to help a teammate. ``It's good to be a good teammate and
take care of each other,'' said Joe Valenzano, the former sports
editor of The Cowl, the student newspaper. ``It's not good to go
out and hunt people down.''
</P>
<P>
   One senior who spoke on the condition of anonymity said he loved
Providence, but that the school must remind everyone that violence
will not be tolerated. He was holding a graduation cap that had
``Done With College'' etched across it. Those words, usually
associated with celebrating a significant achievement, could have a
different meaning for some basketball players at Providence this
spring.

DESPITE OBSTACLES, `MIRACLE' FINISHES FIRST
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   On the face of it, ``Miracle in Lane 2'' doesn't sound terribly
promising. It's programmatic, feel-good material based on a true
story concerning a spunky kid suffering from spina bifida and his
dream to compete in the Soap Box Derby (the depiction herein seems
to take place in an alternative universe in which the Soap Box
Derby is treated like the Super Bowl).
</P>
<P>
   It has a lot of artificial obstacles (creating a brake for the
boy's car not requiring his feet, confronting the Derby tribunal
over its draconian policies regarding the disabled) that are easily
surmounted. It features such melodramatic pronouncements as ``I
hate you! I wish you were dead!'' and ``Racing is the best thing
that ever happened to me! I was so close!''
</P>
<P>
   But darned if ``Miracle in Lane 2'' doesn't triumph over its
narrative problems the same way its heroes emerge victorious over
their creaky plot complications. And the fact that the film stars
``Malcolm in the Middle's'' Frankie Muniz as Justin Yoder, the
young boy in question, not only makes it a must-see for young
viewers but also a richly entertaining one for all ages.
</P>
<P>
   Muniz is aided and abetted by an often funny script by Joel
Kauffmann and Donald C. Yost, which transforms Justin into a
self-deprecating wise-cracker (``My legs are linguini, and I have
more stitches in my head than a baseball'') prone to imaginative
flights of fantasy. He imagines his own funeral, where the preacher
extols the virtues of Justin's wheelchair more than Justin himself,
and some very funny visits with God (Tuc Watkins), who appears to
Justin as his favorite race-car driver, wearing a T-shirt that
reads ``I don't make mistakes'' while working on his hot rod and
taking a blowtorch to some marshmallows.
</P>
<P>
   The film also probes the difficult emotional terrain of Justin's
family _ to pay for his medical procedures, his dad (Rick
Rossovich) is forced to work two jobs and mom (Molly Hagan) also
works long hours. His perfect-seeming jock brother Seth (Patrick
Levis) is seeing a shrink due to his conflicted emotions toward
Justin; in turn, Dad has a complex disconnect when it comes to
Seth's successes. Through all this, the film is even able to
depict, credibly and humorously, Justin's parents' romantic life.
</P>
<P>
   Justin, who has spent his life living in the shadow of his
brother's numerous sports trophies, decides he wants to try out
Soap Box racing when he befriends the grumpy neighbor Vic (Roger
Aaron Brown), who likewise has deeper emotional reasons for his
surliness. Vic, who has previous experience working with Derby
cars, proves to be an invaluable asset, helping Justin reach the
finals.
</P>
<P>
   Muniz, as usual, is adorable and funny. It could also be
important for some children to see someone they respect so much
playing a handicapped character: They might feel a greater
sympatico for the disabled and understand there are fewer
differences between them than there might appear. &QL;

   Once you get past the rather inspired casting of Emilio Estevez
and Charlie Sheen as porn-king brothers, there's virtually nothing
to recommend ``Rated X,'' a docudrama about San Francisco's
Mitchell brothers, Artie (Sheen) and Jim (Emilio), who discovered
porn star Marilyn Chambers and ended their relationship in a
particularly violent manner.
</P>
<P>
   The episodic script, credited to Norman Snider, Anne Meredith
and David Hollander, wouldn't pass muster at a Robert McKee
introductory screenwriting seminar. If Artie meets a woman who's
not a porn actress and spends more than 15 seconds in her presence,
he'll be marrying her within two scenes. There's no explanation as
to how the guys got from running an indifferently attended porn
theater to hosting sold-out galas.
</P>
<P>
   There's not even really any character development _ what did
these guys think of what they were doing? Were they cynical
geniuses or complete chuckleheads? Did they have any redeeming
qualities before they got all coke-addled? You'll never know from
watching this.
</P>
<P>
   Estevez directs, employing all manner of stylistic flourishes _
shock cuts, varying the film speeds, overexposing the film stock _
so that ``Rated X'' looks more like a commercial or music video
than a film. All the pyrotechnics can't disguise, alas, how thin
this gruel is. There have to be better ways to see naked women than
``Rated X.''

THE TANGLED WEB IN THE MURDER OF A RABBI'S WIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW JACOBS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHERRY HILL, N.J. _ For nearly four years, as the innuendo and
accusations mounted about Rabbi Fred Neulander's role in the
slaying of his wife, a burly, talkative man would buttonhole
reporters, strenuously proclaim the rabbi's innocence and offer his
own theories about who might have beaten Carol Neulander to death
in the living room of her suburban Philadelphia home.
</P>
<P>
   Calling himself the rabbi's private investigator, a congregant
and a close friend, Leonard Jenoff would alternately tell reporters
that the 1994 murder was the work either of a bumbling burglar or
an ill-trained terrorist. ``Russians or Israelis,'' he once
whispered to a reporter for a local newspaper, The Jewish Exponent.
``That's all I can say.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he is saying a good deal more.
</P>
<P>
   According to the long-winded confession he made to prosecutors
last week, Jenoff was the man Neulander recruited to kill his wife.
In September 1998, the rabbi was charged with planning his wife's
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff told prosecutors that after confronting Ms. Neulander in
the driveway of her home one evening, he choked on his fear, asked
to use the bathroom and then slinked away. Instead, he told them,
he paid his roommate, Paul Michael Daniels, to help carry out the
killing a week later.
</P>
<P>
   On May 1, shortly after Jenoff made his confession, he and
Daniels were arrested and charged with murder and conspiracy.
Daniels, who is unemployed and who says he is mentally ill and a
longtime drug addict, has told the authorities that he was paid for
his role in the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The Camden County prosecutor has said he may seek the death
penalty for all three defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander, who is free on bail, calls Jenoff's tale a
fabrication. In an interview Wednesday, he emphatically proclaimed
his innocence. ``His story is entirely baseless,'' he said, sitting
in the same room where the murder took place. ``I had nothing to do
with the death of my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   To those who live in the amorphous subdivisions that sprawl east
of the Delaware River, last week's revelations added yet another
layer of intrigue to a sensational crime. Neulander's murder has
fascinated residents and traumatized those who know the 58-year-old
rabbi, a charismatic figure who guided South Jersey's largest
congregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just keeps getting more and more surreal,'' said Pam
Rosenblum, a mother of two young daughters who lives across the
street from the Neulander home. ``We just wish this whole thing
would come to an end already.''
</P>
<P>
   As detailed by prosecutors, the killing of Carol Neulander, 52,
is a convoluted tale of deception that seems to defy common sense.
Neulander, they say, wanted his wife of 29 years dead so he could
continue his affair with another woman, the host of a radio talk
show in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say he feared divorce proceedings would bring out
his infidelity and threaten his position as the leader of M'kor
Shalom, the synagogue he and his wife had started two decades
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jenoff says he wielded the first of four blows that
killed Ms. Neulander, he claims he, too, is a victim, saying the
rabbi took advantage of his weaknesses. The lawyer for Daniels says
the same thing about Jenoff: that he exploited someone he knew had
limited mental capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The conspiracy, as laid out by investigators, brings together
three men seemingly with little in common: Neulander, a community
leader who was cherished by his congregation; Jenoff, 54, a
recovering alcoholic bruised by a string of personal and
professional losses; and Daniels, 26, a troubled soul who has spent
his adult life addicted to cocaine and heroin.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander's trial was originally scheduled for next month,
although it has now been postponed until the fall. It was the
impending trial, Jenoff said, that prompted his confession. With an
absence of hard evidence, Jenoff said, he feared that the rabbi
might be acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just wanted to do the right thing,'' said his lawyer,
Francis Hartman. ``The truth was just eating away at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, he summoned a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter, the
Camden County prosecutor and a detective to a local diner to hear
his story. Over coffee and a cup of fruit salad, he said the rabbi
had lured him into the scheme with promises of $30,000 and help in
getting a job with the Mossad, Israel's secret service.
</P>
<P>
   Although details of his account have changed twice in the last
week, he now says he was initially lured into thinking his target
was an enemy of Israel. Only later, after he had agreed to carry
out the killing, did the rabbi reveal that the proposed victim was
his wife, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander and his lawyers say Jenoff's story is pure fantasy.
One lawyer, Dennis Wixted, described Jenoff as ``an oddball and
eccentric,'' so desperate for attention he would make up a tall
tale for 15 minutes of fame.
</P>
<P>
   He said Jenoff thought he could have his notoriety and escape
prosecution through an immunity deal. So far he has not been
offered a reward for his cooperation, although the prosecutor has
not ruled out leniency.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the confessions of Jenoff and Daniels, Wixted said there
was nothing to link the rabbi to his wife's death, ``no weapon, no
fingerprints, no evidence,'' he said. As he had in the past, he
described Ms. Neulander, the owner of two bakeries, as the victim
of a robbery gone awry.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know Leonard Jenoff said his buoyant personality and
relentless self-promotion masked a battered ego. In recent years,
they said, he endured a stormy divorce, the collapse of his
business, the loss of his home and alcoholism. In a town where most
people own spacious colonials surrounded by well-fed lawns, Jenoff
lived in a succession of modest rented apartments.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, when Jenoff's life was at its most chaotic, a social
service agency referred him to Neulander, who provided financial
assistance and spiritual guidance, lawyers for both men said.
</P>
<P>
   When Jenoff complained about having to attend Alcoholics
Anonymous meetings at a church, Neulander established a 12-step
program at the synagogue. Both men were smokers who would stand
outside the synagogue for cigarette breaks.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, when Jenoff was married a second time, the rabbi
offered his house for the ceremony. ``The rabbi did great things
for my client, but on the other hand it seems as if he was grooming
him for this terrible crime,'' Hartman said.
</P>
<P>
   The rabbi and his lawyers play down the relationship, saying it
never rose to the level of friendship. ``The guy's life was broken
down, a mess,'' Wixted said. ``He came in for spiritual advice.
That's how it started, and that's how it remained.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the affections were not mutual, Jenoff became the
rabbi's most vocal defender soon after Ms. Neulander's death. When
the rabbi was mobbed by reporters after his arrest in 1998, Jenoff
bravely escorted him through the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may be guilty as sin of adultery,'' he announced to
reporters at the time, ``but there's no evidence he hired anybody
to kill his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Neulander has said he thought Jenoff's detective services were
free, and either way, he never requested them in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Wixted has suggested that Jenoff's decision to go to the
authorities may be retribution for not receiving more money for his
work. Wixted described his investigative efforts as farcical.
</P>
<P>
   ``He once went to a psychic and came back with a sketch of what
he said was the killer,'' Wixted said. ``I gave him a check for
$750 and showed him the door.''
</P>
<P>
   The main thing Jenoff and Daniels shared, it seems, were their
battles with addiction. They met at a substance abuse clinic and
later attended 12-step meetings together. In 1995 and 1996, they
shared an apartment at the Landmark, a collection of white-brick
high-rises in Cherry Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels is a paranoid schizophrenic who has struggled with
cocaine and heroin addiction since he was 16, said his lawyer,
Craig Mitnick.
</P>
<P>
   He said Daniels had few friends and many demons. ``He lives the
existence of very simple things,'' he said. ``He's very vulnerable
and easily manipulated.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff has said he paid his roommate $7,500 for his
participation in the crime, a sum Mitnick said he could not
confirm.
</P>
<P>
   According to lawyers for both men, Jenoff posed as a deliveryman
on the night of the killing, Nov. 1, 1994. Once inside the home,
they said, Jenoff knocked Ms. Neulander unconscious with a lead
pipe. He then called in Daniels, who hit her twice more. Before the
pair fled in his car, Jenoff delivered a final blow, lawyers for
both men said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, Neulander came home from the synagogue to
find his wife dead in a pool of blood. When detectives arrived,
they noted that there was no blood on him, something they found
unusual. The lack of blood suggested that he had not touched the
body to check for a pulse or determine a condition, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicions grew when the woman who was pressuring Neulander to
leave his wife told investigators about an exchange they had before
the killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trust me, something will happen by the end of the year,'' she
told prosecutors. She also told them that after the murder the
rabbi said, ``See, I told you to trust me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the five and a half years since Ms. Neulander's death,
Neulander said he has struggled to lead a normal life. Although he
was forced to resign his position at M'kor Shalom, he still
presides over the occasional funeral and wedding. Most days he
works as an educational consultant or spends his time on a book
about his experiences in the rabbinate.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his living room Wednesday afternoon, wearing shorts
and loafers, Neulander appeared relaxed as he spoke about several
topics, from his immigrant parents and the difficulties of
maintaining a front lawn to bouts of loneliness, fear and
humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered around the room were religious books, photographs of
his three grown children and a harmonica he recently began learning
to play.
</P>
<P>
   Many friends and former congregants have abandoned him, he said,
but others have rallied to his side, including his children. ``They
have been terrifically supportive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He described the last few years as ``devastating and
isolating,'' and said he was eager to go to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it will be vile and embarrassing, but when it's all
over, I'm sure the truth of my innocence will emerge,'' he said.
``Then the healing can begin.''

THE CONTEMPORARY `JESUS'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below; `today' refers to Sun. May 14) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As played by Jeremy Sisto, ``Jesus,'' in the words of those
philosophers the Doobie Brothers, is just all right. He boogies
with the best of them, he gets in playful water fights with his
disciples, he has a hearty laugh reminiscent of Jeff Bridges,'
which he employs copiously and with good-natured encouragement when
his followers unwittingly say idiotic things. As CBS's mini-series
``Jesus'' posits him, he's kind of the first leader of a
self-empowerment getaway weekend seminar.
</P>
<P>
   Portraying Jesus is kind of a thankless task, at least until the
betrayal and crucifixion parts of the story kick in: Even though
the whole point of Christ was that He was a human, the actor isn't
really expected to depict Him as such. Movie Jesus has to be all
beatific and bland, white-bread and just a smidge dreamy (in both
senses of the word). Sisto boasts all the usual traits of our
Western concept of Jesus, but because he's trying to exercise some
subtlety, he doesn't quite have the charisma one might expect from
the leader of a world religion.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, ``Jesus'' is a handsomely mounted version of the
gospels. It boasts the requisite international cast (Armin
Mueller-Stahl as a German Joseph lamenting the plight of the Jews,
Jacqueline Bisset as the Virgin Mary with a French-British accent).
Of course, there's an American Christ and Satan (Jeroen Krabbe) and
Pontius Pilate (Gary Oldman, not as loud as usual but still loud)
have British accents. It hits all of the high points of Christ's
life we all grew up with in Sunday School (the Transfiguration,
water into wine, resurrecting Lazarus, overturning the tables at
the temple, etc.). A fictional character named Livio is laced
throughout the proceedings; he's essentially the Forrest Gump of
Ancient Jerusalem: He's on hand for all the tumultuous occasions.
He also explains the political situation leading up to Christ's
crucifixion to such an extent his name should be Expositio.
</P>
<P>
   It's all done well, with reverence and an occasionally sense of
humor, but it's also something most of us have seen reenacted so
many times (including last month, with ABC's ClayMation ``The
Miracle Maker,'' which told the same story in half the time) that
the question seems to be, why do we need another version?
</P>
<P>
   The mini-series' most interesting conceit also turns out to be
its most problematic: Its depiction of Satan. When Jesus spends his
40 days in the wilderness, preparing for His mission, ``Jesus''
missteps grievously by having Satan (Jeroen Krabbe) show up in a
contemporary black suit (with black T-shirt) and use special
effects in order to tempt Christ: It's the Devil as Hollywood
Executive.
</P>
<P>
   Satan's second appearance, while Jesus awaits his unenviable
fate at Gethsemane, is more compelling. He argues that all Jesus
will achieve by sacrificing Himself is becoming a figurehead for
oppression: ``Killing for Christ will be a big business in the
coming centuries,'' Satan hisses, cynically but accurately. Jesus
must find a commanding reason to repudiate Satan and !ital!not!off1
save His own skin.
</P>
<P>
   What's interesting about this is that Martin Scorsese did
essentially the same thing 13 years ago in ``The Last Temptation of
Christ'' (both films even open with Jesus having a nightmare).
Instead of showing Jesus in turmoil over how His name would be
wrongly used over the centuries, Scorsese showed Jesus in turmoil
in consideration of the simple joys of humanity He, as a man, was
sacrificing in order to save all of mankind.
</P>
<P>
   Both films eloquently describe thoughts that reasonably could be
expected to have run through His mind under those final
extraordinarily difficult circumstances of a man's life, but
Scorsese was roundly pilloried for his efforts while today,
religious groups are extolling this  &QL;

TRANSFORMING THEATER ROW 
</HEADLINE>
   By RALPH BLUMENTHAL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some of the prostitutes had Actors' Equity cards.
That, at least, was a point of connection for the theater people
and other dreamers who 25 years ago thought they could reclaim
perhaps the seediest sex strip on wild West 42nd Street.
</P>
<P>
   There was another link to culture. The International Body Rub
Institute, the French Palace and other massage parlors that lined
the block between 9th and 10th Avenues were decorated with murals:
nudes, many painted by a quixotic Israeli artist who waited on
tables down the block at the Hello Deli.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like the Bloomsbury Group goes porn,'' recalled Andre
Bishop, artistic director of the Lincoln Center Theater and one of
the founders of Playwrights Horizons, a pioneer in the ultimately
successful effort to turn the block into the flourishing Theater
Row, which prefigured the far larger revival of 42nd Street and
Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Now the eastern half of the enclave, between Ninth and Dyer
Avenues, is poised for its own transformation. With the stroke of a
pen _ lots of strokes of lots of pens, actually _ the biggest Off
Broadway theater redevelopment project in New York City history has
taken final form.
</P>
<P>
   Contracts for a new 499-seat Shubert theater, five new or
rebuilt smaller theaters and a 40-story apartment tower overlooking
the Dyer Avenue exit from the Lincoln Tunnel were signed on April
14, supercharging a renewal that until now has been makeshift.
</P>
<P>
   There was no self-congratulatory announcement but relief that
the complex series of closings had survived. Participants looked
back at what some called an unlikely urban drama, largely
unscripted, with (so far anyway) a happy ending. In all, from
pornographic past to high-rise future, the resurgence became, quite
literally, a groundbreaking story of urban renewal through the
arts.
</P>
<P>
   It even drew praise from an unlikely quarter: Martin Hodas,
known in his heyday in the 1970s as ``the peep show king'' and the
entrepreneur behind many X-rated storefronts that have since been
driven from the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a wonderful thing they did,'' said Hodas from his
home in Queens. ``I never liked the idea of massage parlors.''
</P>
<P>
   The strip, a theater locale in decades past, entered the 1970s
so tawdry that some visitors preferred to come and go walking down
the yellow line in the middle of West 42nd Street, far from the
soliciting women and the string of menacing sex boutiques and
grungy groceries.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Live Burlesque'' house, where women strolled around
talking off their clothes and pointing absently to parts of their
anatomy, ignored its electrical bills, so Con Edison finally ripped
up the street and disconnected the power cable to the building.
</P>
<P>
   The cellar of another club was home to a reclusive old woman
with an enormous wardrobe who emerged intermittently in full makeup
and laden with jewelry to roam the block shrieking at passers-by.
</P>
<P>
   Into this mix in 1975 stepped Playwrights Horizons, a
four-year-old company that had just lost its home in the West Side
YMCA. Its artistic director, Bob Moss, took one look around and
decided, ``Sometimes you have to do things that don't make any
sense, and this is one of them.'' He took quarters in an abandoned
pornographic movie house at 422 W. 42nd St. for $1,200 a month and
rechristened it the Judith Anderson Theater, then soon expanded
Playwrights' stake on the block by moving down the street to the
former burlesque house at No. 416, at twice the rent.
</P>
<P>
   The company appealed for help from Broadway luminaries, among
them Richard Rodgers. Instead of cash he sent a contribution more
to the point: $500 worth of paint, Lysol and cleaning equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Even the streetwalkers pitched in, Bishop recalled, with those
holding union cards asking for parts. ``There was an odd
camaraderie on the block,'' he said, ``particularly when the fleet
was in.''
</P>
<P>
   The company soon put itself on the map with hits like
``Vanities.''
</P>
<P>
   A second brave troupe, the Lion Co., arrived, and others,
including the South Street Theater, Intar and the Acting Co. soon
followed. Moss, who left Playwrights to become artistic director at
Syracuse Stage, a leading outpost of regional theater, dated the
turnabout from the day in 1975 when he looked out of his window and
saw strangers, including one out-of-place interloper in a business
suit, surveying the strip for who knew what.
</P>
<P>
   They included Fred Papert (the suit), who had founded the
nonprofit 42nd Street Development Corp. during the successful
effort to save Grand Central Terminal on East 42nd Street from the
wrecker's ball. (His compatriot in the effort, Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis, later wielded a shovel in the Theater Row groundbreaking.)
</P>
<P>
   Papert's group had bought the block of West 42nd Street between
9th and 10th Avenues from desperate landlords who had been losing
money and faced mounting tax bills while playing reluctant host to
sex establishments. By holding a mortgage on the properties of the
nonprofit group, they at least had a chance for some financial
recovery if the renewal took, which is in fact what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the unsightly buildings, Papert wondered what it
would it would take, short of demolition, to turn the neighborhood
around.
</P>
<P>
   Moss told him: ``I have a better idea. This can all be turned
into theaters.''
</P>
<P>
   By picking tenants who changed the ``urban vibrations,'' as
Papert put it, his group turned the trickle of new theaters into a
boomlet, which he hoped to advance with his relentless promotion of
a 42nd Street trolley line.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the new Manhattan Plaza housing towers across
West 42nd Street to draw sufficient tenants to the wasteland
produced another opportunity: 80 percent of the units were
earmarked for low-paid people in the performing arts. That idea
proved a bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the first lights going on in the apartments,''
Bishop said. ``It was an outstanding moment. Suddenly we didn't
feel as desolate.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the last links with the gritty past are about to be severed.
Demolition for the new apartment tower and theaters began last week
by the builders, Daniel Brodsky, Robert Quinlan and Michael Field.
They said the $75 million job, which includes 260 rental
apartments, 20 percent of them for low- and moderate-income
tenants, could be completed in 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   The Shubert organization is spending $6 million or more on its
new theater, its 17th wholly owned establishment in the city and
the city's first commercial stage built specifically as a transfer
house for productions that start modestly off or off Off Broadway
and then, on the strength of reviews, seek to make the leap to
theaters large enough to earn money or even, if lightening strikes,
to Broadway. The new theater will be run by Ben Sprecher, who owns
the Variety Arts and Promenade Theaters and manages the Lucille
Lortel.
</P>
<P>
   The project also includes two theaters with 99 seats and one
with 199 seats on a 41st Street parcel acquired from the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey. They will replace three
99-seat theaters that now occupy the Shubert site. Two other
theaters of 83 and 99 seats, the Harold Clurman and the Samuel
Beckett, will be rebuilt in place, and support space, including new
rehearsal studios, will be provided.

A FATHER OF POTTERY AS A HIGH ART
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Hong Kong, Britain)  By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was only about 80 years ago that the West started
to see pottery as high art, and that view was shaped by Bernard
Howell Leach, an English studio potter who learned his art in
Japan. It was Leach who said, ``Pots, like all forms of art, are
human expressions.''
</P>
<P>
   With his writings as well as with his ceramics, he played a
major role in elevating the status of the European potter from
craftsman to artist, thereby paving the way for the 20th-century
studio pottery movement.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1887 in Hong Kong to British parents, Leach worked first
as a painter. In 1909 he went to Japan to teach etching techniques.
While there he began to study pottery under Ogata Kenzan VI, a
master potter and the last of the Kenzan line. (Kenzan is both a
name and a title.) Leach excelled at throwing pots by hand and
subtle glazing.
</P>
<P>
   John Driscoll, the director of the Babcock Gallery in Manhattan
and a collector of Leach's work, said, ``The sixth Kenzan had such
respect for Leach's work that he passed on his credentials to
Leach, who became the seventh Kenzan, probably the only
non-Japanese ever to be one.'' In 1920 Leach was invited to join an
English artists' community in St. Ives, Cornwall.
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman in the community offered him a stipend if he would
start up a traditional Japanese kiln,'' Driscoll said. Leach in
turn asked the Japanese potter Shoji Hamada to join him in St.
Ives. They worked together for three years, then Hamada (1884-1977)
returned to Japan to start his own pottery studio north of Tokyo.
In 1955 Hamada was named a Living National Treasure of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Leach lived until 1979. ``His 1940 treatise, `A Potter's Book,'
remains the bible of anyone who wants to be a ceramic artist,''
Driscoll said. ``It's astonishing that there is no place to see his
work in New York.'' He added: ``The history of 20th-century
ceramics begins and ends with Bernard Leach, whether you are
American, British, Danish or Japanese. He made the work of the
artist potter a legitimate path to pursue.''
</P>
<P>
   Louise Cort, curator of ceramics at the Freer Gallery of Art and
Arthur M. Sackler Museum in Washington, said: ``Leach was a very
important influence on articulating Japanese values about form and
issues in ceramics. His book was the first by a potter in England
that did not talk about techniques but about art. It was the first
book by a ceramics artist speaking as an artist.''
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, Leach is usually considered a ``Japanese''
potter, because he made Japanese-style ceramics. That is why his
works, along with those of his Japanese contemporaries, will be in
the Phillips Auctioneers May 17th sale of 20th-century Japanese
ceramics and design. The viewing, which begins Saturday, and the
sale are at the American Craft Museum, 40 West 53rd Street in
Manhattan, which Phillips has rented for the month.
</P>
<P>
   Though there are relatively few American collectors of
20th-century Japanese ceramics, Dan Klein, the international
executive director of Phillips, chose to have the auction in New
York. ``I had a concept of what we would do at the craft museum,''
he said. ``I wanted to have our sales of decorative arts and crafts
there, along with Impressionist paintings and photography, to show
there's no distinction between the decorative arts and fine arts.''
</P>
<P>
   The May 17 sale includes nearly 100 lots of Japanese stoneware
and porcelain, 45 of which came from a private collection in Japan.
Some of the teapots, tea bowls, stoneware bottles and pitchers were
designed for the Japanese tea ceremony; the majority are studio
works by top names in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rarely have enough quantity of the quality of these objects
to have a whole sale dedicated to them,'' said Ben Williams, the
head of the Phillips ceramics department. ``It's taken a couple of
years to assemble this sale. The Japanese are object- and
vessel-based. They prefer functional wares and hold them in higher
esteem than we do. In museums they will place a pot by Hamada or
Leach next to a Picasso. They don't make the distinctions we do
between craft and utilitarian objects.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Walkup of the North Texas Institute for Educators on the
Visual Arts has written, ``It is important to set aside Western
aesthetics as criteria when making judgments about non-Western
art.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary aesthetic concept at the heart of traditional
Japanese culture is the value of harmony in all things,'' she
continued. ``This world view is nature-based and concerned with the
beauty of studied simplicity and harmony with nature.''
</P>
<P>
   This aesthetic, particularly as it pertains to the tea ceremony,
is sometimes called wabi-sabi. Wabi has to do with understated
elegance, peacefulness, modesty and the natural world. Sabi has to
do with serenity, having age or history, and showing the maker's
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most comprehensive example of the Japanese aesthetic of
wabi-sabi is found within the traditions of the tea ceremony,''
Walkup wrote. ``It symbolizes aesthetic simplicity and represents
the fundamental Zen principles of harmony, respect, purity and
tranquillity.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said: ``The tea ceremony plays a major part in Japanese
ceramics. Objects used in the ceremony are meant to fit the hand
perfectly. They inform the way you stand, and the way you hold the
cups.''
</P>
<P>
   The aesthetic is not about perfection but imperfect beauty.
Imperfections are revered. ``Imperfection has a human value,''
Williams said. ``The Japanese seem to appreciate defects. Spur
marks on a dish show it's handmade and unique.''
</P>
<P>
   The sale has several works by Leach. The most unusual is
probably the red slipware dish with a leaping deer from about 1928.
Because the drawing is freehand, the dish resembles 17th-century
English earthenware. Its estimate is $5,000 to $7,000.
</P>
<P>
   There are also Leach Japanese-style works: stoneware vases
glazed in dark olive blues and browns, porcelain celadon tea bowls
and a pale green stoneware bottle vase decorated with motifs that
look like calligraphy in red overglaze enamel.
</P>
<P>
   Leach's friend Hamada is also well represented in the sale.
There are examples by lesser known artists. Dr. Frederick
Baekeland, a by-appointment-only New York dealer in modern Japanese
ceramics since 1976, said names were overrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name of the game is the name for most people,'' he said.
``Only a small number of collectors and dealers buy on aesthetic
grounds only. But you can get more for your money from a person who
is not so famous.''
</P>
<P>
   Though well known in Japan, some potters in the sale are
unfamiliar to many Americans: Kanjiro Kawai, Kenkichi Tomimoto,
Munemaro Ishiguro, the Living National Treasure Tatsuzo Shimaoka,
and Shiro Tsujimura.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the pieces in the sale come with the wood boxes that
were made to hold them, and most of the boxes are signed by the
artists. Baekeland said, ``In Japan, a piece without the box is
worth half the price, even if the piece is signed.''

`HAMLET': `A SIMPLER MELANCHOLY' 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end of review) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It is curious; one never thinks of attaching `Hamlet' to any
special locale,'' the critic Kenneth Tynan once wrote of
Shakespeare's tragedy, and the director Michael Almereyda has
brilliantly seized upon that by rooting his voluptuous and
rewarding new adaptation of the play in today's Manhattan. The
city's contradictions of beauty and squalor give the movie a sense
of place _ it makes the best use of the Guggenheim Museum you'll
ever see in a film _ and New York becomes a complex character in
this vital and sharply intelligent film.
</P>
<P>
   Almereyda contours the material to his own needs, even though he
was inspired by the 1987 ``Hamlet Goes Business,'' a deadpan update
by the renegade Finnish director Aki Kaurismaki. This ``Hamlet'' is
also set in the corporate world, where Claudius (Kyle MacLachlan)
has risen to the top of the Denmark Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But where Kaurismaki presented his take as a slapstick tragedy
that bordered on sadism, Almereyda layers his cool-to-the-touch
version with a luxuriant paranoia compounded by the constant
deployment of video cameras and listening devices.
</P>
<P>
   Often shaded in lush, soothing hues of blue, ``Hamlet'' exudes
an intoxicating masochism in which half the cast is battling
despondency and the other half has the glint of imminent insanity.
As insightfully played by Diane Venora, Hamlet's mother, Gertrude,
is in danger of breaking down into a fine, distraught powder from
the outset. In this version, the melancholy of Hamlet (Ethan Hawke)
over the death of his father is almost a state of grace _ it gives
him a sense of purpose that the other characters lack.
</P>
<P>
   Almereyda has created a new standard for adaptations of
Shakespeare, starting with an understanding of the emotional pull
of the material that corresponds with its new period and setting.
Hamlet's soliloquies are now interior monologues except for the
``To be or not to be'' speech, which he delivers in a Blockbuster
video store, using the blue in the company logo and the word
``Action'' emblazoned on the shelves to fit in with the mood and
color of the rest of the picture.
</P>
<P>
   The director's rigorous trimming has a boldness and vivacity
that makes this version exhilarating while leaving Shakespeare's
language and intent intact. The use of colors _ its palette is red,
green and the aforementioned blue _ is a visual manifestation of
the streamlining. This movie will send shivers of happiness through
audiences because it's one of the few American productions of
``Hamlet'' constructed around the rhythms of the actors, giving
each scene a different pulse.
</P>
<P>
   Almereyda plays to his performers' strengths, and it's awe
inspiring. The truly revelatory performance comes from the ravaged
dignity that Bill Murray lends Polonius, a weary, middle-aged man
whose every utterance sounds like a homily he should believe in and
perhaps did many years ago. Murray takes the bemused hollowness he
first discovered in sketch comedy and gives it a worn, saddened
undercurrent; it's what those bullying cynics he plays in comedies
would be like in real life after about 20 years. The speech
Polonius gives to his son, Laertes (Liev Schreiber), has a truth
that ``Death of a Salesman'' can only aspire to and certifies
Murray _ who's been giving fully shaped performances in bad or
little-seen movies for years _ as one of the finest actors
currently working. ``Madam, I use no art at all,'' he says at one
point, and it's true; he uses apparent artlessness to achieve art.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just Murray and Venora who are worth watching.
MacLachlan's Claudius has a hail-fellow-well-met shallowness, a
blandness tinged with creeping ambition. Schreiber is all lovely
Old World elegance; he uses his resonant, trained voice to find the
injured quality of lines like ``You wound me, sir,'' and offers a
classical turn in the midst of the modernity. Steve Zahn plays
Rosencrantz as slacker-weasel with a blurry twang that is just
what's called for here. And Karl Geary is a steadfast, affecting
Horatio.
</P>
<P>
   Conceptually, ``Hamlet'' has all the goods and then some. Oddly
enough, the title character is a little lacking in complication.
Hawke's laudable commitment to the project was obviously
responsible for getting it made, and his feline transparency would
appear to be right for a Hamlet wrestling with the urge to kill
Claudius and avenge his father's death.
</P>
<P>
   But this Hamlet is mired in an arrested adolescence that
infantilizes him, wearing knit caps that make him look like a lost
member of the Spin Doctors. For this conception to be fully
realized, Hamlet's interior monologues shouldn't so fully mirror
what's going on with him outwardly _ a contrast would have provided
some tension. Hawke's moping slows things down too much, and a clip
from a James Dean movie playing behind him emphasizes the
self-pitying aspect.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Stiles plays Ophelia, and this may be the first time in
her brief film career that this wildly talented young actress has
seemed immature. ``Hamlet'' exploits her youth effectively _
Polonius laces up her sneakers as he addresses her. But Stiles
seems too much a child and often can't get her footing as the
production sprints past her. Her natural onscreen empathy does
allow for several moments that get under the skin: Ophelia plunges
into an azure pool, imagining her death; she's often photographed
at some of the most beautiful fountains and water spouts in New
York. And when distraught, she dissolves into sobs, flinging
Polaroids as if they were flower petals; it's heart-rending. The
scenes she has with Hawke with a conventional and definable
give-and-take also serve her well.
</P>
<P>
   Little of Almereyda's previous films (``Another Girl, Another
Planet,'' ``Nadja''), which are often dizzy with promise, suggested
that he had the technique and imagination he brings to bear here.
It's incredibly satisfying to see a director grow in the ways that
he has. The ``Romeo and Juliet'' director Baz Luhrmann fired his
camera out of the barrel of a gun, and the overdirected velocity
was a moviemaker's equivalent of a collection of nervous tics;
Almereyda's audacity comes in problem solving, one of the true
functions of a director.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Luhrmann's dazzle is all from the outside, Almereyda
goes to the heart of things and has given Shakespeare a
distinctively American perspective. ``Hamlet'' is a movie about
urban isolation and the damage it causes, using corrupted wealth as
a surrogate for stained royalty.
</P>
<P>
   To develop the distrust and miscommunication _ a contemporary
spin on the Shakespearean theme of people being out of touch with
their natural environments _ bits of dialogue are filtered through
other sources, like overheard phone conversations. Almereyda's use
of technology is fascinating and well thought out; Hamlet's dead
father (Sam Shepard), for example, is first glimpsed on video
screens. Hamlet's ``get thee to a nunnery'' speech to Ophelia
becomes an unrelenting tantrum; it follows her home and continues
to attack her when she turns on her answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also catch snatches of material out of the corner of your
eye, like Jeffrey Wright's cameo as the Gravedigger singing ``All
Along the Watchtower,'' a piece of pop music that was made for
Shakespeare: ``There must be some kind of way out of here, said the
Joker to the Thief.''
</P>
<P>
   So much of the play is pleasurably recast _ like a snapshot of
Fortinbras on a television screen, as the Player King (Robin
MacNeil), now a news anchor, wraps things up _ that Almereyda has
created a hunger for more. In so many ways, ``Hamlet'' is a
palpable hit, or it should be.

`BATTLEFIELD EARTH': EARTH CAPITULATES TO MEAN ENTREPRENEURS FROM
SPACE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELVIS MITCHELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Man is an endangered species,'' announces one of the titles at
the beginning of the sci-fi lump ``Battlefield Earth.'' And after
about 20 minutes of this amateurish picture, extinction doesn't
seem like such a bad idea. Sitting through it is like watching the
most expensively mounted high school play of all time. The film is
stocked with evil aliens who, in their padded body stockings,
plastic armorlike fittings and matted hair extensions, resemble
nothing so much as members of GWAR, the metal-rock parodists that
Beavis and Butt-head loved. It may be a bit early to make such
judgments, but ``Battlefield Earth'' may well turn out to be the
worst movie of this century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plan Nine From Outer Space'' for a new generation,
``Battlefield Earth'' is set in the year 3000, after the beings
from the planet Psychlo have conquered our planet in only nine
minutes. Humans have been reduced to grunting illiterates by the
Psychlos (who have the same name as their home planet). ``Stupid
man-animals,'' bellow the Psychlos, who at nine feet tower over the
earthlings, though several feet of Psychlo height seems to come
from the offworld Doc Martens they sport.
</P>
<P>
   The chief nasty, Terl (John Travolta), wants nothing more than
to finish his stretch supervising workers on Earth and return home
to Psychlo. But political matters, which make parts of this movie
look like some alien version of C-Span, trap him on Earth forever.
Terl devises a scheme to put the man-animals to work in the gold
mines for him, after which he'll have a small fortune and rule
Psychlo forever.
</P>
<P>
   Terl sees potential in one particularly rebellious cave dweller
(Barry Pepper) and straps him to a machine that beams the wisdom of
the ages into his head. Little does Terl realize that by educating
a human, he is sowing the seeds of his own destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from the novel by L. Ron Hubbard, who cranked out sci-fi
pulp by the cubic ton, ``Battlefield Earth'' has the musty feel of
the days when the genre's highlight was Flash Gordon. For example,
it never gets around to explaining what Psychlos do with gold in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   They also have to write reports and send them back to the home
office, where presumably work even duller than this takes place:
that's right, it's the horrifying Planet of the Bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   None of the aliens _ who apparently are evil just because it
feels good _ get around to chortling: ``Puny earthlings! No one can
save you now!'' But Travolta does the next best thing. He throws
back his head and delivers a stage laugh that would embarrass the
villain from the shoddiest Republic Pictures serial or an episode
of ``Xena: Warrior Princess.'' The eye-rolling broadness of his
turn in ``Broken Arrow'' suddenly becomes a marvel of nuance and
understatement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Battlefield Earth,'' directed by Roger Christian
(``Nostradamus,'' ``Masterminds''), is beyond conventional
criticism. It belongs in the elect pantheon that includes such
delights as ``Showgirls'' and ``Revolution'': the Moe Howard School
of Melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard created the Church of Scientology _ news to just about
no one _ and when the beams of light fly into the bound Pepper's
head, it has the unfortunate appearance of a nightmare version of
Scientology. ( Travolta, a member of Scientology, is one of the
film's producers.)
</P>
<P>
   The only professional thing about the movie is the sound: It's
so loud you feel as if you're sitting on a runway with jets taking
off over your head. The drone of real aircraft would be preferable
to what passes for plot. Travolta is a big enough star to survive
``Battlefield Earth,'' though any career that includes this film
and the sludgy melodrama ``Moment by Moment'' may be placing too
much faith in the karma of the comeback. Surprisingly, Forest
Whitaker defies the laws of dramatic gravity and entertains as
Terl's idiotic sidekick, Ker.
</P>
<P>
   Pepper's character is referred to by his fellow Earthlings as a
greener, meaning he's always looking to the other side, where the
grass is greener. That would be just about anyplace other than
theaters showing ``Battlefield Earth.''

 &HT;    BRITAIN, ZIMBABWE RIFT DEEPENS AS FORMER COLONY'S LAND WAR
CONTINUES
 &HT;    (950&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    With primer box on Zimbabwe attached at end of story.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., May 14 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Britain and its former colony Zimbabwe are embroiled in
a rancorous conflict that some diplomats fear may make an already
dangerous crisis even worse.
</P>
<P>
   So deep is the rift between Britain and President Robert
Mugabe's government that the United Nations is expected to appoint
a mediator to attempt a reconciliation. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan is expected to name a go-between within a few days, diplomats
said.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's President Thabo Mbeki raised the possibility of
U.N. mediation last week after talks between the British and
Zimbabwean governments failed to produce a resolution to the bloody
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Zimbabwe, the former Rhodesia, has been
deteriorating rapidly since February, when men who identified
themselves as veterans of the country's war of independence began
invading white-owned farms to take back land they believe belongs
to black Zimbabweans. Nineteen people have been killed in the
violence _ 16 of whom were black _ all of whom were opponents of
the Mugabe regime.
</P>
<P>
   Most white farmers, who own about a third of Zimbabwe's
productive land, are of British descent, and many hold United
Kingdom passports. About 70,000 of the country's 12.5 million
residents are white.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe's 76-year-old president, has vigorously
supported the farm raids and has stepped up his campaign of blaming
whites and Britain for the country's deepening economic crisis.
Mugabe, who led Zimbabwe's war in the 1970s against white rule,
suspended parliament in April and is required by the constitution
to hold a general election by August. The president, who fared
poorly in a constitutional referendum in February, has not yet set
a date.
</P>
<P>
   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook has been unsparing in his
condemnation of Mugabe for the violence and chaos. Cook, Britain's
point man on last year's NATO attacks on Yugoslavia, has demanded
that Mugabe stop the violence and submit to free and open
elections.
</P>
<P>
   When Mugabe ignored his demands, Cook placed an embargo on arms
and military equipment to the former colony and suspended US$57
million in payments for land reform. Britain also orchestrated a
harsh condemnation of Mugabe's government by the Commonwealth of
States, the association of the United Kingdom and former British
colonies.
</P>
<P>
   After securing the rebuke, Cook took the opportunity to scold
Mugabe. ``That statement from the Commonwealth will have a
considerable impact around Africa, but perhaps particularly in
Zimbabwe, where President Mugabe had tried to pretend that the
problem is only Britain,'' Cook said. ``What President Mugabe is
crying out for is for us to treat him as a martyr so he can then
try to present himself, in elections, to his own people as somebody
who is standing up on their behalf against the old colonial
master.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, a furious Mugabe accused Britain of conspiring with
the white farmers to topple his government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down with British imperialism and neo-colonialism,'' Mugabe
shouted to an aroused assembly of his party members earlier this
month. ``Let us realize that the world is inimical, that there is a
campaign, a very vicious campaign against Zimbabwe.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe said he found it ironic that the country's former
colonial masters would lecture Zimbabwe on human rights. ``What can
the British teach us ever? What lessons can we learn from them,
what justice, what morality? None.''
</P>
<P>
   The fiery president said he was unconcerned about Britain's
threat to end financial support. ``They can keep their money,'' he
told the jubilant party members. ``We want our land. And from our
land we will get money.''
</P>
<P>
   Whites are welcome to leave, he said. ``We can also assist in
showing them the various ways they can leave the territory,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We want good relations with Britain, but the Britain of today
is hostile, and we would rather be on our own than have a hostile
friend,'' Mugabe said. ``A hostile friend is an enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hostility over the Zimbabwe crisis is common in England, where
sympathy with the white farmers is nearly universal. For weeks,
Britons have been inundated with images of bloodied and beaten
whites. The press here has been relentless in its attacks on Mugabe
and his regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't deny that it makes me really angry to hear Mugabe
saying whites this and whites that,'' said Simon Barnard as he
sipped a pint of bitters at the Red Lion pub in central London. ``A
few thousand Royal Marines would set things right for my money.''
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers have carried stories that Britain and its allies have
made plans for a military rescue of 20,000 European Union citizens.
The government has denied that it had devised any such plans, but
spokesmen have suggested that the government was planning for every
contingency.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki and other African leaders worry the dispute could get out
of hand and perhaps inspire other maverick African politicians to
take up Mugabe's hard-line tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki is expected to raise his reservations about the aggressive
British approach to Zimbabwe at a summit in London next week with
Cook and British Prime Minister Tony Blair. The South African
president is expected to castigate the British for responding with
harsh statements and actions to every new twist in Zimbabwe while
telling leaders that an African solution was needed.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki's stance is backed by other African leaders and the
Commonwealth, the only organization now believed to have a chance
of defusing the situation in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Former South African President Nelson Mandela, who was in London
last weekend, also called for a quieter approach to dealing with
Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no use standing on hilltops and shouting about such a
highly sensitive matter,'' Mandela said. ``An approach through
diplomatic channels without much publicity is more likely to bring
about a positive result.''

RETAIL SALES DIP FOR FIRST TIME SINCE AUGUST 1998 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN VAMES   
 c. 2000 TheStreet.com/N.Y. Times.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Retail sales in the U.S. slumped slightly in April for the first
time since August 1998, as a slow start to spring in many parts of
the nation kept shoppers waiting for better weather to purchase
their warm weather goods.
</P>
<P>
   Retail sales fell 0.2 percent overall in April, following March
sales that were upwardly revised to 0.5 percent from an early 0.2
percent reading, the Commerce Department said Thursday. Excluding
automobiles, retail sales were unchanged. The dip in sales
surprised economists, who had been looking for retail sales to rise
0.4 percent, and 0.3 percent excluding autos.
</P>
<P>
   While overall sales still remain at strong levels, the decline
in April is likely to ease the minds of economists and policy
makers, who fear that overzealous consumer spending is sowing the
seeds of inflation. Sales have risen at a dizzying pace recently
despite steadily rising interest rates, which in theory should have
slowed consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp upward revision in March sales and the still-solid
level of sales in April is not likely to deter Federal Reserve
policy makers from continuing to raising short-term interest rates
when they meet next on May 16. The Fed has raised rates five times
in 0.25 percentage point increments since last June, and many
economists expect them to up the magnitude of their next hike to
0.50 percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rallied following the sales data, in part because slower
sales may mean less of a chance that the Fed will actually move by
0.50 percentage point. By midday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average
was up about 131 points, while the Nasdaq Composite Index was up
75.
</P>
<P>
   But most economists who are anticipating a bigger rate move
stuck to their forecast, keeping bond prices largely unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Fed officials have repeatedly warned that heavy consumer demand
for goods and services is outstripping domestically-produced
supply, which could lead to inflation as more dollars chase fewer
goods. Cheap imports have helped to fill the gap and offset
inflationary pressures, but import prices have been on the rise.
The Labor Department said Thursday that on an annual basis, import
prices were up 6.3 percent in April, although declining oil prices
inspired a month-to-month drop of 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The softness in April sales might be among the first signs that
higher interest rates, with help from an early-April drop in
technology stocks, might be starting to have a chilling effect on
American consumers. But many economists may not be convinced yet
that the April decline is an interest-rate inspired slowdown, or
just a temporary pause, until they see further signs of slower
retail activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This hints that retail sales in the second quarter will be
softer,'' said Ed McKelvey, senior economist at Goldman Sachs.
``But it's not, by any means, a conclusive sign that interest rates
have slowed consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   McKelvey pointed to several temporary factors that suppressed
overall sales in April, including the cooler-than-usual weather in
most of the country. Other factors included a 2.3 percent drop in
gasoline sales due largely to price fluctuations, and a 1.6 percent
decline in building materials after the unusually warm winter kept
construction activity high, compared to most years when
construction projects surge in April.
</P>
<P>
   If April's slowdown is indeed the beginning of a trend, some
retailers may find themselves in a troubling situation. A number of
retailers have been struggling with shrinking profits, even in the
first quarter, when retail sales were vigorous.
</P>
<P>
   Another economic indicator Thursday that tracks the number of
Americans filing for first-time unemployment claims fell 7,000 to
297,000, an indication that the booming labor market continues to
keep Americans employed.

`COMING SOON': IT'S GOOD TO HAVE GOALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By A.O. SCOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Coming Soon'' explores two phenomena that have inspired
countless magazine articles and how-to guides, as well as
widespread anxiety and fascination: the female orgasm and the Ivy
League admissions process.
</P>
<P>
   Colette Burson's amiable new comedy follows three seniors at the
prestigious (and barely fictitious) Halton School in Manhattan as
they struggle to find academic advancement and sexual fulfillment.
The story focuses on a smart, winsome strawberry blonde named
Stream (Bonnie Root), and what plot there is turns on her search.
</P>
<P>
   Since this is a romantic comedy _ imagine a collaboration
between John Hughes and Whit Stillman in close consultation with
the editors of ``Our Bodies, Our Selves'' _ the happy outcome is
never in doubt, and the audience's pleasure along the way depends
on the heroine's momentary frustration.
</P>
<P>
   The ironclad conventions of the genre demand that she transfer
her affections from the bad rich boy (archetypally impersonated by
James Spader in ``Pretty in Pink'' many years ago and here played
by James Roday) to the social misfit whose true sensitivity is
camouflaged in sullenness and sarcasm. Within the rarefied social
world of Burson's script (written with Kate Robin), this role is
filled by young Henry Rockefeller (Ryan Reynolds), who declares his
rebellion by changing his last name to Lipschitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``How Emilio Estevez,'' exclaims Stream's friend Jenny (Gaby
Hoffmann), and it's not always clear whether the movie means to
endorse her mockery or refute it. Henry, who sports a wispy hipster
beard that vanishes and reappears from scene to scene, starts out
as an annoying poseur but by the end he's a rock 'n' roll
dreamboat.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny herself is subjected to similarly whimsical treatment.
Sometimes she's a self-absorbed, spoiled ninny, sometimes a fount
of hard-headed feminine wisdom, sometimes a sad, lonely girl decked
out in fishnet stockings and heels. But as portrayed by Hoffmann,
who may be the Madeline Kahn of the Clearasil set, she's also the
source of some of the film's best scenes, and the mouthpiece for
its funniest lines. ``My father bought me a learning disorder'' is
Jenny's blase explanation of why her low SAT scores won't keep her
out of Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Even Hoffmann's estimable comic energies are overshadowed by Mia
Farrow, her orange curls like a circus fright wig, who plays
Stream's mother, Judy, as a batty bundle of New Age nostrums and
neurotic rage. ``I feel 100 percent judgmental,'' this dogmatically
nonjudgmental purveyor of countercultural toothpaste shrills when
she discovers that her daughter is, as the saying goes, sexually
active.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie's most exacting satiric judgment is reserved for
Judy and her generation, which includes Spalding Gray, as a
pompous, self-promoting college admissions adviser, and, briefly,
Ryan O'Neal as Stream's father, predictably remarried to a
predictably bubble-headed younger woman.
</P>
<P>
   Judy, meanwhile, is dating a tiresome ceramicist played by Peter
Bogdanovich, who once directed O'Neal in a frothy romantic comedy
called ``What's Up, Doc,'' which also starred Barbra Streisand,
whose name is dropped in passing, as well as Madeline Kahn, whom we
may one day regard as the Gaby Hoffmann of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Coming Soon'' takes up the cause of a later generation,
it recalls the salutary candor of the '70s about sexuality,
especially female sexuality. Its frank good humor stands in sharp
contrast with the strange combination of timidity and
exploitiveness of more widely distributed recent teen-age comedies
like ``Down to You,'' ``Whatever It Takes'' and ``Committed,''
which can't decide whether young women's sexual desires should be
punished or ridiculed _ if they are even allowed to exist.
</P>
<P>
   Burson's pluck and honesty may indeed be the reasons that her
film _ like Sarah Kernochan's ``All I Wanna Do,'' another unusually
intelligent, unapologetically feminist vehicle for Hoffmann's
talents _ has been pushed to the margins of the entertainment
world. ``Coming Soon'' was passed over by several major studios and
twice threatened with the dreaded NC-17 rating by the Motion
Picture Association of America. It has now been released in an
R-rated version by Unapix Films.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing gratuitous or graphic on the screen _ no
nudity, no skimpy starlet get-ups, nothing but respect, in fact,
for the young women who make up its cast and its intended audience.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, ``Coming Soon'' has its share of loose ends and its
longueurs. Given her subject matter, Burson might have been a bit
more attentive to narrative rhythms. No, the earth doesn't move,
but at least you don't feel used afterward.

`MOTHERKIND': CARETAKER FOR BOTH SON AND MOTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In fierce, magical works like ``Black Tickets'' (1979) and
``Machine Dreams'' (1984) Jayne Anne Phillips depicted characters
torn between the dream of home _ ``a two-lane road densely overhung
with the deciduous trees of a more familiar world'' _ and the dream
of escape. Restless survivors of the '60s, these people found
themselves on the road, on the move, on the lam, and yet their very
rootlessness and dislocation left them haunted by the families and
vanished small-town worlds they had tried to leave behind.
</P>
<P>
   Though Kate, the heroine of Phillips' disappointing new novel,
shares an emotional resume with her earlier creations _ a girlhood
in Appalachia, years of aimless wandering, a sense of fragmentation
and loss _ she has now settled down to a life of quiet domesticity
in the outskirts of Boston. She has become what her husband, Matt,
calls ``the Queen of Safety'': she has ``circled the wagons''
around her family, and wants ``everything absolutely tacked down,''
as she struggles to take care of her newborn son and her ailing
mother, Katherine.
</P>
<P>
   In the hands of writers like John Updike, Anne Tyler and Alice
Munro, this sort of bourgeois existence has provided the makings of
a compelling fictional world. But in Phillips' case, the mundane
routines of daily life do not fully engage her imagination. As a
result, her decision to take a sort of `` Dalloway'' approach to
Kate's story, minutely recounting her every move and mood, feels
claustrophobic and static: a litany of a stressed-out woman's
struggles with diapers, baby prams, spoiled stepchildren, her
mother's pain medication and her own vagrant feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``MotherKind'' has none of the hypnotic gothicism that gave
``Black Tickets'' and ``Shelter'' a subversive undertow, and the
bulk of its scenes, which take place in or near Boston, lack the
sure sense of place that lent books like ``Machine Dreams'' a
specific gravity and weight. In fact Phillips, who grew up in a
small West Virginia town much like the ones featured in her earlier
work, demonstrates little feel for New England in this volume: it's
a generic, yuppified world, defined vaguely by changing seasons and
elaborately celebrated holidays.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason Phillips has chosen not to use her superb gifts
as a ventriloquist in ``MotherKind'': Her characters do not talk to
us in the first person, as they have in so many of her previous
books, but are viewed through the distancing scrim of an omniscient
narrative that lends their thinking a strangely portentous,
second-hand feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kate sometimes imagined herself a flat meadow ravaged by
wildfire, an unsuspecting meadow,'' Phillips writes. ``For years,
she'd avoided babies, which was easy, because most women she knew
didn't have them. Most women thought they were looking for men, not
babies. Kate thought now that they were wrong: they were all
looking for babies, even those who said they didn't want children,
or didn't like them.''
</P>
<P>
   Kate finds herself becoming a new mother and her own mother's
caretaker at the same time. As a girl she had been her mother's
confidante _ privy to the secrets of her parents' failing marriage
_ and now, she vows, she will be her mother's partner ``in this
long dance, this last boat trip.'' As Katherine grows weaker and
weaker, the roles of mother and daughter are reversed. It is Kate
who must monitor her mother's medication schedule and encourage her
to eat; it is Kate who tends life in the house, trying to balance
the demands of her mother, her son, her husband and his two
children. Her own work as a poet recedes, as that ``alternate
world'' of words, of association and image, takes a back seat to
her familial duties.
</P>
<P>
   In much the same way that she used her sensual imagination to
evoke the humid atmosphere of adolescence in ``Shelter,'' so
Phillips evokes the mysteries of pregnancy, birth and motherhood in
these pages: the hormonal haze, the heightening of memory and
expectation. Yet when she turns to the actual facts of Kate's life
_ going to the mall, preparing for an Easter party, taking the
children to the beach _ her poetic gifts falter, giving way to
flat-footed even perfunctory recitations of tasks performed and
noted.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, her looping narrative, which continually
moves back and forth in time in small, jerky flashbacks, impedes
the forward momentum of the novel without adding much in the way of
felt emotion. The short scenes set back home in Appalachia, while
finely written, simply point up the pallor of the scenes set in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   It is only in the last quarter of the book, as the illness of
Kate's mother accelerates, and Phillips focuses on the intricacy of
the mother-daughter bond, that the reader's sympathy is truly
engaged. These final pages have an immediacy lacking in the
remainder of the book, an unflinching willingness to look at the
complex machinery of familial relations and the obdurate fact of
mortality, and they remind the reader of the author's enormous
gifts as a writer, gifts that are sadly hidden in the remainder of
this volume.

`CENTER STAGE': A `FAME' FOR TODAY'S DANCING, STRIVING
ADOLESCENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
 By A.O. SCOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alan Parker's ``Fame'' is a movie that will live forever in the
memories of anyone who was a stage-struck adolescent _ or the
parent of one _ in the waning days of the Carter administration.
But it has been 20 years, almost to the day, since that swirling,
high-kicking soap opera about students at New York's High School
for the Performing Arts was released, and today's aspiring troupers
surely deserve a movie of their own about young artists coming of
age and learning how to fly.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Hytner's ``Center Stage'' will do, but just. It is
narrower in scope than its predecessor, which followed a
multicultural cohort of actors, dancers and singers through sexual
identity crises and professional growing pains. This film tracks a
small group of students at the fictitious American Ballet Academy _
which is somewhere near the real Lincoln Center _ through a
stressful year of Prussian discipline, cut-throat competition and
sexual intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   Not too sexual, though, or too intriguing. The plot of ``Center
Stage'' is a harlequin print of romantic triangles involving
dancers, choreographers and the academy's fearsome artistic
director, played with feline cool by Peter Gallagher. He has stolen
a prima ballerina away from his protege, a brilliant, impetuous
dancer named Cooper Nielsen (Ethan Stiefel), who in turn steals
Jody, an insecure dancer in training (Amanda Schull), away from one
of her classmates (Sascha Radetsky).
</P>
<P>
   All of this will be recapitulated, ``American in Paris''-style,
in Cooper's show-stopping ballet at the movie's end. Meanwhile,
Jody must struggle with bad feet and a body somewhat curvier than
the ostrich-neck balletic ideal in her quest to make the
end-of-the-year cut. And Maureen (Susan May Pratt), the most
ruthlessly competitive and prodigiously talented student at the
academy, will have to choose between normal life, represented by
her sweet Columbia pre-med boyfriend (Eion Bailey), and art,
embodied by her pushy, uptight harridan of a stage mother (Debra
Monk).
</P>
<P>
   These are not subtle characterizations. Maureen is bulimic, a
counterweight (so to speak) for another character who guiltlessly
gobbles down fruit tarts and is dismissed from the school for the
fleshiness that results. Rounding out the cast are Zoe Saldana as
Eva Rodriquez, whose bad attitude is signaled by the fact that she
swears, chews gum in the salle, and often shows up late to class,
and Shakiem Evans as Erik, apparently the only gay male dancer in
Manhattan. But you know that Eva's passionate commitment to her art
will triumph just as surely as you know that her stern, impatient
teacher (Donna Murphy) will turn out to have a heart of gold, and
that any romance Erik finds will take place safely off screen.
</P>
<P>
   The script, by Carol Heikkinen, has a lot of business to take
care of before the Big Show, which is its mandatory climax, and it
steamrolls through its expository scenes with more efficiency than
grace, as though in a desperate hurry to reach the next commercial
break. But who ever went to a dance movie to see good writing? Or,
for that matter, important acting? However shabbily it treats her
sister muses, ``Center Stage'' at least honors Terpsichore, whose
devotees can practice their leg extensions during the dramatic
bits.
</P>
<P>
   The cast includes just enough real actors to make these bits
bearable, and even occasionally touching. But its three most
important parts have been given to dancers. Steifel is a principal
dancer for the American Ballet Theater, where Radetsky also dances,
and Schull is a member of the San Francisco Ballet. Can they act?
What a stupid question. They can read, which suffices.
</P>
<P>
   In films like ``The Madness of King George'' and ``The
Crucible,'' adapted from plays, Hytner has shown a rare knack for
opening up stage-bound material, and he may have been drawn to this
project by the technical challenge of capturing the pure, thrilling
physicality of dance in the disembodied medium of film. Dance tends
to be recorded either somnolently, by stationary cameras meant to
replicate the perspective of a live audience, or by hectic cutting
and panning, which often deliberately blurs what the dancers are
actually doing. In the long dance sequences at the end of ``Center
Stage,'' Hytner's camera follows the performers without stepping on
their toes, to marvelous effect.
</P>
<P>
   Hytner was helped by two talented, omnivorous choreographers,
Susan Stroman and Christopher Wheeldon, whose discipline and
ebullience save some of the movie's ill-conceived big numbers _ at
a salsa club and a downtown jazz studio _ from triteness and
vulgarity. Cooper's climactic dance, Stroman's work, at first looks
like a horrifying compilation of ``Dirty Dancing'' pelvic action
and the kind of knee sliding and arm-waving that was mercifully
quashed at this year's Oscars, but it ends up being, like this
movie, sexy and infectious in spite of itself.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A palace was not a palace without a patio in the days
of Don Pedro Fajardo y Chacon, the Castilian nobleman who built the
Castle of Velez Blanco near the southeastern coast of Spain between
1506 and 1515. The crowning glory of his Gothic abode was its
patio, an ensemble that mated local Gothic and Spanish-Moorish
structural elements with architectural and decorative components
from the Italian Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Now fast-forward from the 16th to the 20th century and to the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, where, by one of those happy sets of
circumstances that often befall the Met, the Velez Blanco patio was
installed in 1964. A treasure in its own right, it also serves as a
grand entrance to the Thomas J. Watson Library and as a showcase
for the museum's collection of Italian Renaissance statuary,
including Tullio Lombardo's ``Adam'' (circa 1490-1495), an early
Renaissance example of a heroic nude.
</P>
<P>
   The courtyard, closed for refurbishing in 1997, reopens Friday,
and is closer than it has been in many years to its 16th-century
self. Its delicate carvings, modeled on monuments of Roman
antiquity, have been meticulously cleaned; more sophisticated
lighting has been installed; and greater authenticity has been
achieved by a new floor of white Macael marble, styled like the
patio's original paving and taken from the same quarry. The big
Fajardo coat of arms, formerly under the arcade, has been
reinstalled in a more visible position, high on the patio's west
wall.
</P>
<P>
   On the east wall is a richly colored Flemish tapestry of early
Renaissance vintage, ``The Triumph of Fame,'' thought to have once
been owned by Queen Isabella of Spain and recently acquired by the
Met. The museum has seized the occasion to mount two temporary
shows, ``Sculpture and Decorative Arts of the Spanish Renaissance''
and ``The Forgotten Friezes From the Castle of Velez Blanco.''
</P>
<P>
   The patio was originally built, at Don Pedro's behest, by an
itinerant group of Northern Italian sculptors and artisans who
carved its 2,000-odd marble parts and worked them into a graceful
ensemble of arcaded galleries, capitals, windows and door frames
that is considered one of the treasures of early Renaissance Spain.
By the early 19th century, after decades of political unrest, the
castle was abandoned, and at the turn of the 20th its owners sold
the intact patio to a Parisian dealer.
</P>
<P>
   In search of a centerpiece for his own castle going up at Park
Avenue and 67th Street, the investment banker and art collector
George Blumenthal bought the patio in 1913. Later, from 1934 to
1941, he served as president of the Met and bequeathed it his
treasure. In 1945, four years after his death, his house was razed,
and the patio was dismantled and shipped in blocks to the Met.
</P>
<P>
   It lay in storage until 1963, when, after a five-year research
project by Olga Raggio, now chairman of the Met's department of
European sculpture and decorative arts, it was reassembled at its
present site. Two extra arches and some modernities added during
the Blumenthal restoration were tossed out, and voila! In the words
of Raggio, who has also supervised the latest restoration, a
monument was returned to life.
</P>
<P>
   The show on the patio's balcony, ``The Forgotten Friezes From
the Castle of Velez Blanco,'' adds another twist to the monument's
lengthy saga. In 1992 the removal of an old heating system at the
Museum of Decorative Arts in Paris uncovered crates containing 10
large horizontal reliefs, unopened since their arrival, by bequest,
in 1905. Each relief is about 20 feet long and robustly carved in
Scotch pine. Their subjects are the triumphs of Julius Caesar and
the labors of Hercules, heroic ideals to which men of the
Renaissance aspired.
</P>
<P>
   Research by Monique Blanc, curator of the department of medieval
and Renaissance art at the Paris museum, established that the
friezes _ most with pieces missing _ were made for the reception
halls of the very same Velez Blanco castle from which the patio was
stripped. Six of the panels _ three devoted to Caesar, three to
Hercules _ are on view in the show.
</P>
<P>
   They are an impressive group, each panel squeezing a dense
medley of images into its limited space. The fact that they lacked
a religious theme, a rare circumstance in Roman Catholic Spain for
works displayed so prominently, is seen as evidence of Don Pedro's
preference for the classical tradition in which he was educated.
</P>
<P>
   The three friezes concerning Caesar depict his triumphal
procession through Rome. In the most salient, a fierce-looking
Caesar, waving a victory palm, rides on his chariot preceded by
officials carrying the fasces of authority, musicians, a dancing
jester and soldiers bearing booty. Behind him comes his horse,
really a unicorn with human feet, and the beginning of a long
procession of cavalry soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest of the Herculean friezes illustrates the
super-baby in his cradle strangling serpents sent by the goddess
Hera to destroy him, slaying the redoubtable Nemean lion that had
been ravaging the countryside and dispatching a three-headed
monster named Cacus who stole cattle that Hercules had liberated
from a three-bodied giant named Geryon.
</P>
<P>
   The two sets of friezes are stylistically different: the
Herculean figures are more naturalistic than the Caesarean and
closer to late Gothic in their landscape, composition and narrative
structure than to the Renaissance mode of the Caesar reliefs. Their
compositional density does not make for easy reading, but the
challenge is worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   The other show, of 65 Spanish Renaissance sculptures and
decorative objects installed in a small gallery right off the
patio's main floor, includes many items from the Met's collections
that have not been publicly displayed before. Polychrome figures
and reliefs, glass and lusterware, church silver, metalwork, tiles
and a rare pair of tapestries from a set of 10 illustrating events
during the Catholic reconquest of Spain by Ferdinand and Isabella
give an idea of the cross-cultural influences on Spanish art by
Muslims and Western Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   Standout sculptures include a Spanish Pieta from the first half
of the 16th century, delicately carved in alabaster with traces of
polychromy, notable for the mingled expression of horror and pity
on the Virgin's face. ``The Holy Family With Saints Anne and
Joachim'' (1567-68), a relief in wood by Diego de Pesquera,
beautifully exemplifies the Spanish technique of estofado, in which
gilt and polychromy play off each other in complex patterning. A
later, startlingly realistic life-size statue of St. John the
Baptist (early 17th century) by Juan Martinez Montanes departs
innovatively from the estofado technique by the use of a more
natural polychrome finish.
</P>
<P>
   In the small selection of silver liturgical articles, an
elaborate mid-17th-century monstrance _ designed to protect and
display the consecrated wafer at Mass _ immediately strikes the
eye. Of silver gilt with applied enamels, it is attributed to Diego
de Atienza, a Spaniard active in Peru, who made it for a friar in
Lima. Its lower half is more in the austere early 17th-century
style of Philip II in Spain, but the elaborately rayed nimbus, or
sol, containing a glass compartment for the wafer, is much more
extravagant, anticipating later Peruvian developments.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   One of the most characteristically Spanish arts is wrought iron,
of which there are a few good examples here, though not enough. A
fine 17th-century grille of wrought iron and bronze by Francisco
Gonzales repeats elegantly proportioned skinny spindles for
decorative effect; a 17th-century drop-front desk of carved and
gilded bone and wrought iron with intricate geometrical patterning
shows the lingering influence of Islamic design.
</P>
<P>
   Plates, bowls, vases and other examples of lusterware, a type of
tin-glazed earthenware imitating Chinese porcelains, range from
refined to folksy. On the more restrained side is a double-handled
water bottle from Valencia (first half of the 16th century) whose
allover floral pattern is bordered by Moorish geo-metrics. But
there is naive exuberance in the treatment given a dish whose
crudely drawn image of the Christ child displays symbols of the
Passion on a band down the front of his robe.
</P>
<P>
   Glassmaking, an Andalusian specialty in Renaissance Spain later
refined by the immigration of Venetians to Catalonia, is
represented by a number of ebullient pieces, notable for their
florid design with lots of swirls and loopy handles. Among the
flasks, bowls, decanters and vases is a plain cow from the 17th
century, of pale pinkish glass tinged with purple, probably
inspired by the Muslim dromedary flasks then popular in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, a very good day for Spanish culture.

story in Fortune magazine featuring a very tight close-up on the
face of Cisco CEO John Chambers.
</P>
<P>
   There's essentially nothing new in the Barron's piece, which
doesn't make it wrong. Barron's makes two main arguments: That
Cisco can't ever grow into its valuation and that changes in
accounting practices will slow Cisco's acquisition engine.
</P>
<P>
   The first point has been debated for months, if not years, and
people believe it's a good bet that Cisco can never grow into its
valuation. Back on April 17, when Cisco traded for $57 per share, I
wrote a column showing that the company was worth 158 times
trailing earnings and 111 times current-year forecasts. And yet,
despite those eye-popping valuations, Cisco is one of those stocks
everyone seems to need, at any price.
</P>
<P>
   The stock pushed up over $71 since then, before falling back to
$62.75 in regular trading hours Monday. When a company that is
growing earnings in the 40 to 50 percent range trades for triple
its profits, it's overvalued. It's that simple.
</P>
<P>
   Fortune, in a beautifully written, if puffy homage by the
talented Andy Serwer, swats this out of the park by saying of
Cisco, essentially, ``Don't worry, be happy.'' Because Cisco is so
good at what it does, investors will continue to reward it with a
multiple that's a huge premium to its growth rate.
</P>
<P>
   Who's right? We just don't know. Barron's landed the tougher
punch. Understand that both stories are what journalists call
``curtain raisers.'' They were priming the pump for Cisco's release
of quarterly earnings. Cisco has reported earnings of 14 cents a
share before one-time items, compared with 9 cents a share a year
ago. The results topped Wall Street forecasts of 13 cents.
</P>
<P>
   This all gets the debate going and gives analysts and
interviewers talking points for CEO Chambers. But they don't
resolve the issue. Investors do, and they do it over a matter of
months and years, not minutes or days.
</P>
<P>
   The other important assertion in Barron's is that Cisco is
building a house of cards with its myriad acquisitions that rely on
the pooling-of-interests method of accounting, which eliminates
goodwill and therefore minimizes damage to future earnings.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a big difference between a traditional
``roll-up,'' where companies acquire oodles of other companies to
make their revenues grow, and what Cisco does.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco acquires companies with big revenue potential and then
helps them meet that potential by integrating the new companies
into their marketing and sales juggernaut. It's true that that game
can't continue without a valuable currency to use for acquisitions,
but Cisco's impressive revenue growth is more akin to organic, or
internal, growth than it is to typical roll-up behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Who deserves the credit for a unit that had $10 million in
revenue last year, contributing $100 million this year? I'd say the
current team deserves more than its fair share.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the issue of what happens if pooling accounting
goes away, as the accounting profession has proposed, and Cisco
starts printing losses because of big goodwill charges. Fortune
explains away this issue by noting that Cisco is lobbying hard in
Washington to see that pooling remains, so everything's OK there.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm, that doesn't exactly convince me. More to the point, I'd
argue that even if Cisco were to start printing ``losses,'' while
maintaining operating pace, investors might be willing to overlook
the ``losses`` stemming from charges.
</P>
<P>
   For example, JDS Fitel wasn't able to use pooling-method
accounting for the merger that created the current version of the
company because Fitel, based in Canada, required the use of
Canadian accounting rules. So that company accounted for its merger
as a purchase and reported net losses of $241 million, or 32 cents
per share, for the quarter ended March 31. That figure includes
``merger-related intangible amortization charges,'' and it isn't
what Wall Street watches.
</P>
<P>
   Investors note that JDS Fitel, an indirect competitor to Cisco,
has ``pro-forma'' earnings of $86 million, or 11 cents per share.
At its current share price of around 90, JDS Fitel trades at about
237 times analysts' ``earnings'' estimates for the fiscal year
ending June. Is this too much? You be the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Another example of this accounting gymnastics is so-called cheap
stock, the term of art for non-cash expenses related to option
grants to executives at below fair-market value. Silicon Valley
companies used to fight the Securities and Exchange Commission
tooth and nail on this because the charges for cheap stock were
killing earnings. Then they realized that investors were willing to
look through the non-cash charges and focus on operations.
</P>
<P>
   Now, nobody fights the cheap-stock charges anymore, they just
record them and investors ignore them.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that Cisco's favorable accounting treatment might
be eliminated and the market still wouldn't care. But there's no
doubt the company can't grow into its valuation in the time that's
been allotted to it.
</P>
<P>
   All that is unresolved is how long investors are willing to
accept huge premiums and indulgent accounting. As long as they are,
it won't matter how ``right'' the analysis of valuation and
accounting is.

METHODIST'S GRIEF TURNS TO HOPE

<P>
   CLEVELAND _ When the Rev. Kelly Ann Clem showed up last week at
the Cleveland Convention Center for the United Methodist Church's
General Conference, a woman checking for her name tag stopped and
smiled at her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `I know who you are. I want you to know we prayed
for you.' That happens all the time. I feel powerfully connected to
my brothers and sisters, especially in the Methodist Church,'' Clem
said during a lunch break at the conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clem is not one of the superstars of Methodism; not a bishop or
the pastor of a huge church. She is the pastor of Southside United
Methodist Church, in a rural community near Gadsden, Ala. But six
years ago, she was thrust into the national spotlight when Goshen
United Methodist Church, where she was serving then, was struck by
a tornado during a Palm Sunday worship service. Twenty people in
the church died, including Hannah Clem, the 4-year-old daughter of
Kelly and Dale Clem.
</P>
<P>
   Now 40, the mother of 8-year-old Sarah and 3-year-old Laurel
Hope, Clem and her husband, who is also an ordained Methodist
minister, are poised for a new venture of faith. They are set to
become missionary pastors in Lithuania. With her frosted hair cut
short and dangling earrings, Clem looks more like a suburban soccer
mom than a buttoned-down missionary.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back at the tragedy, she said, ``I remember everything
about that day. How can it be that all that happened in one hour in
church? It's still hard to believe it even happened to us.''
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the chaos that ensued, with national television
cameras looking on, she spoke of faith and assurance. A long string
of funerals followed, including Hannah's, but the next Sunday, Clem
led Easter Sunday services for her congregation in an improvised
church.
</P>
<P>
   She was interviewed by Katie Couric and The New York Times.
Everyone marveled at how serene she appeared. But inside, she was
dealing with crushing grief. The day the tornado hit, she had told
her superiors that she couldn't go back to her church.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a natural reaction,'' said Bishop Robert Fannin of the
North Alabama Conference. ``She was thinking, `How can I bear to be
reminded of my suffering?' But her tremendous understanding of
ministry called her to realize she had to work through the
suffering with her congregation.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of her parishioners, Clem said, ``They'd come to me and
throw their arms around me. They were being my pastor. I realized
we needed each other.''
</P>
<P>
   She cried every day for nearly two years, she said, yet she
stayed at Goshen until July 1996, long enough to see a new church
building constructed, in large part with funds that poured in from
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong Methodist who spent her high school years in
Annandale, Va., Clem studied psychology at Furman University, then
went to Duke Divinity School in hopes of being a church-based
counselor, not a pastor. But at Duke, she said, ``I found out who I
was. I was in the company of people who thought like I did. It was
like all of me fit in. I realized God had led me to this point.''
</P>
<P>
   She met and married Dale Clem there and after graduating from
seminary in 1985, they returned to Dale's native Alabama as a
clergy couple. Eventually, Dale was appointed campus minister at
Jacksonville State University in Alabama while Kelly stayed with
parish work.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, they will be off to Lithuania, part of a new
initiative by Methodists in Eastern Europe. The Clems became
interested in the region through sponsorship of a child from
Belarus who was exposed to radiation from the Chernobyl disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Then in March, Dale Clem accompanied a medical missionary trip
to Lithuania. There are eight new Methodist congregations there,
and they were looking for clergy couples. Within two weeks of
submitting an application, the General Board of Global Mission told
them they had been approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to keep them in North Alabama, but without question
Kelly and Dale can serve the church well anywhere they are. I can't
say enough about them,'' Fannin said.
</P>
<P>
   Clem said she still thinks about Hannah every day, but takes
comfort from her daughter, Laurel Hope, who was born with a
V-shaped birthmark on her forehead identical to one Hannah had.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we had to name this child Hope. I had hoped it
wouldn't be a girl; I thought it would be too hard. But she's so
funny, she's brought us laughter. We haven't stopped smiling since
she was born.''
</P>
<P>
   As for her poise at a moment when many would have been incapable
of speech, she said, ``We needed to tell our story. It may have
helped deal with the grief. It kept us from bottling it up. Most
people aren't as blessed as we were. It let us tell our story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'll grieve for the rest of my life, but I think back
with such awe at how the congregation, strangers, even the media
became vehicles through which we could tell the story of our faith
in Christ.''

   AIDS-DRUGS (Paris) _ In a move that could change the face of
AIDS treatment in Africa and Asia, five major pharmaceutical
companies offered Thursday to negotiate deep cuts in the prices of
their drugs for poor nations plagued by the disease. The
announcement was made by the World Health Organization in Geneva,
and the companies were careful not to appear together to discuss
the offers. All were afraid of running afoul of American antitrust
laws, which prevent corporations not only from colluding to raise
prices, but from colluding to lower them. But even if the prices
drop steeply _ and cuts of 80 percent or more are being talked of _
no one expects an easy end to AIDS in the Third World. By Donald G.
McNeil Jr.

   U.N.-AFRICA (United Nations) _ Nine days ago, seven members of
the Security Council, led by Richard C. Holbrooke of the United
States, took off for Congo to gauge what small hopes for peace
might be salvaged from a conflict reaching across half a continent.
A lot was at stake, they thought: the political and economic
stability of at least six countries embroiled in the Congo; the
fabulous wealth of the country, one of Africa's largest and
richest, and the future of U.N. peacekeeping. By the time the team
returned to New York on Thursday, seven countries and several new
crises later, Congo had all but receded into the background of
broader concerns about Africa and its evolving political
leadership. And U.N. peacekeeping was on the ropes before a single
soldier was even sent to Congo. By Barbara Crossette.

   RUSSIA-MEDIA (Moscow) _ Armed tax police on Thursday searched

limiting his company's freedom of speech. The police insisted it
was a criminal probe. (Summary from wires) By Celestine Bohlen.

   AFRICA-TRADE (Washington) _ The Senate on Thursday decisively
approved legislation to promote commerce with Africa and the
Caribbean, ending more than five years of trade-bill defeats for
the Clinton administration. The 77-19 vote underscored the unusual
bipartisan support for a compromise measure hammered out by Senate
and House negotiators that would lower tariffs and quotas on
products from sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean and Central
America. With Senate approval and overwhelming backing from the
House, which approved the measure last week, the legislation now
goes to President Clinton, who strongly supports the bill and is
expected to sign it quickly. By Eric Schmitt.

for use in trying to protect sensitive areas from development. The

Democrats, reflecting the election-year lure of a bill that would

lawmakers a chance to cast what many portrayed as a vote on behalf
of the environment. By Douglas Jehl.

in Los Alamos were evacuated, and on Thursday morning another 7,000
fled suburban White Rock, where many evacuees had once sought
safety. At the storied Los Alamos nuclear laboratory, for the first
time shut down by fire, flames singed a research building but it
did not ignite. Explosives and radioactive material were protected

   FORD-SUVS (Atlanta) _ In an extraordinary statement for a large
corporation, Ford Motor Co., which started the sport utility boom
in 1990 and is now one of the world's two biggest producers of
sport utility vehicles, said that it faced a ``dilemma'' in
continuing to sell the highly profitable vehicles despite what the
company acknowledged were serious safety and environmental
problems. In a ``corporate citizenship report'' issued at the
company's annual shareholders' meeting here, Ford Motor
acknowledged that sport utilities contribute more than cars to
global warming, are permitted higher tailpipe emissions, and pose
safety and visibility dangers for other motorists. Ford said that
it was making progress toward solutions and was even looking for
alternatives to the off-road vehicles, although continuing to
produce them. By Keith Bradsher.

SCHWAB TRADING ACTIVITY CONTINUES TO DECLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER FRIEDLIN   
 c. 2000 TheStreet.com/N.Y. Times.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Schwab (SCH:NYSE), the leading discount and online
brokerage firm, said Thursday that seasonal factors were weighing
on customer trading activity in May, continuing a slowdown that
began in March.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts saw the drop as a sign of flagging investor
enthusiasm following a bout of stock market volatility.
</P>
<P>
   ``After starting this year with four very active months, overall
market volumes have declined recently and we are once again
experiencing the seasonal pattern that we've seen in the past two
years _ our customers' trading activity thus far in May is down
from April levels,'' David Pottruck, Schwab's president and
co-chief executive, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   But Henry McVey, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
attributed some of the drop in activity to waning interest
following a steep 15.6 percent tumble in the Nasdaq Composite index
in April, the biggest drop since August 1998. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 stock index fell 3.1 percent during the month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seasonal slowdown begins in May but the tumultuous market
and the pullback of the Nasdaq clearly affects investors' appetites
for trading stocks,'' said McVey, who rates Schwab an outperform.
His firm has not done any underwriting for Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab said it added $7.9 billion in new money in April.
However, it ended the month with $774.9 billion in client assets,
down 6 percent from March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab attributed a 56 percent decline in net new assets from
March to ``customer tax-related disbursements.''
</P>
<P>
   Total customer daily average trades totaled 386.8 million in
April, down 8 percent from March. Daily average revenue trades were
317.3 million in April, off 9 percent from the previous month.
</P>
<P>
   The company did not return a call for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Constant, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, said he was
unconcerned by Schwab's announcement, noting that investors, who
have been trained to buy on the dips, might see the recent decline
as a buying opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is how long this correction lasts,'' Constant
said. ``In third-quarter 1998, the pullback was a little scary, but
it was short lived and there was a sharp rebound a couple of months
later.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Buying on the dip is a behavior that has been reinforced,'' he
added. Constant rates Schwab a neutral and has not done any
underwriting for the company. He said his rating reflected
valuation concerns rather than fears of a slide in activity.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab is the first firm to report a drop in activity in May and
the third to signal a decline in April. Trading fell 10 percent at
Datek Online Holdings and 12 percent at leading Nasdaq market maker
Knight/Trimark Group.

`SHADOW BOXERS': IT'S NOT ABOUT MUSCLES
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As much as some people would like to regard boxing as
nothing more than a brute contest of physical endurance, the sport
also has its spiritual side. The importance of attitude _ of
psyching yourself up and psyching out your opponent, of maintaining
a feeling of emotional and physical self-mastery under extreme
stress _ is almost as crucial to winning as physical strength and
agility. That point is brought home again and again in ``Shadow
Boxers,'' Katya Bankowsky's upbeat documentary portrait of women's
boxing, a sport that has only recently begun to be taken seriously
by promoters.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the movie, which opens today in New York, focuses on
Lucia Rijker, the Dutch prizefighter who is the closest thing to a
superstar in women's boxing. In and out of the ring, Rijker exudes
a take-charge charisma and calm self-containment that recall the
imperturbable solidity of a star like Queen Latifah. Determined and
relentless in the ring, Rijker, a Buddhist chanter, is a wonder to
watch as she maneuvers with a ferocity that seems unaffected by any
mood swings.
</P>
<P>
   Rijker, who was born in Amsterdam of mixed racial parentage, was
a teen-age kickboxing champion before she took up regular boxing.
In 1994 she moved to Los Angeles to go professional and was pursued
by several promoters, including Don King and Bob Arum. (She ended
up signing with Arum as his first female fighter.) Since 1997 she
has held the title of women's super lightweight boxing champion of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing the joys and stresses of boxing, Rijker is more
articulate than most fighters. The training process, she says, is
an intensely isolating experience because of the concentration on
self. That may explain why the movie offers no glimpses into her
personal life, although she does mention that she would one day
like to have a family. We also see her fitting in comfortably at an
otherwise all-male training camp. Here, she doesn't strain to be
one of the boys or insist on attending their raucous all-night
parties, at which she describes her fellow trainees as behaving
like ``eight animals.''
</P>
<P>
   For Rijker, isolation breeds self-knowledge. Boxing. she says,
forces her to go to scary psychological places she would normally
never visit and to confront her deepest fears. She is also aware of
how short-lived a profession it can be: She keeps a picture of
herself as a baby beside a portrait of a fighter who died in the
ring to remind herself of the risk of remaining in the sport for
too many years.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's portrait of Rijker is wound around a cursory survey
of women's boxing, which the Golden Gloves did not recognize until
1995. Rijker's professional career is contrasted with that of Jill
Matthews, a Golden Gloves flyweight, who jokes that she prepared
for her championship bout with ``a manicure and a pedicure.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthews' vision of the personal rewards of boxing closely
parallels Rijker's. For both women, it is a profoundly
self-empowering sport in which winning can be so heady that they
recognize its addictive potential. But for women, winning isn't
really a triumph of muscle power as it is of self-discipline or as
Matthews tersely phrases it, ``of mind over matter.''

`DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE': BUNUEL'S OLD AGE AND SECOND
CHILDHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Luis Bunuel's career began with one of the most famous images in
cinema _the sliced eyeball of ``Un Chien Andalou,'' his 1928
collaboration with Salvador Dali _ and ended in the 1970s with a
loose trilogy of high-style surrealist extravaganzas for the French
producer Serge Silberman. The first of these _ ``The Discreet Charm
of the Bourgeoisie,'' which won the Academy Award for best foreign
film in 1973 _ has now been rereleased by Rialto Pictures, to
celebrate the centennial of the director's birth. More such
releases are promised, but `'The Discreet Charm'' is an excellent
place to renew acquaintance with Bunuel (who died in 1983), or to
meet him for the first time. In half a century of moviemaking that
took him from his native Spain to Mexico, Italy and France, Bunuel
experimented in a wide range of styles, from the Italianate
neo-realism of ``Los Olvidados'' (1950), to the tragic eroticism of
``Viridiana'' (1961) to the fashion-magazine sadomasochism of
``Belle de Jour.'' ``The Discreet Charm'' belongs both to his old
age and to his second childhood: It combines a masterful command of
the medium with a mischievous, anarchic sense of imaginative
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The plot is a kind of metaphysical shaggy-dog story, involving
six highly cultivated people attempting to sit down to a civilized
meal together. Their efforts are obstructed first by a simple
misunderstanding _ guests arrive to find their unprepared hostess
in her satin dressing-gown _ and then by progressively weirder
occurrences involving international drug-smuggling, surprise
military exercises, and a succession of dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Before long the film forsakes linear narration altogether and
becomes a marushka doll of alternating realities, dreams within
dreams, flashbacks inside of tangents, periodically intercut with
shots of the six principals strolling along a desolate country road
on their way either to a grand picnic or a Technicolor remake of
``The Seventh Seal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But what is the meaning of this?'' asks Madame Thevenot (the
resplendent Delphine Seyrig, she of the satin dressing gown) when
the doings become especially peculiar. You may ask yourself the
same question, at once missing the point and getting the joke. The
fun of the film is that the characters play every scene with
unflappable propriety and absurd dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Rey _ decked out in gray plaid suits and leather gloves
and, at one point, an exquisite silk paisley robe _ is a debonair
Latin American ambassador who may be at the center of an
international drug smuggling operation, may have killed one of his
hosts in cold blood and may be having an affair with his best
friend's wife, played by the icily elegant Stephane Audran. When
the friend (Jean-Pierre Cassel) discovers the two in almost
flagrante delicto, they have a drink and make dinner arrangements
as though nothing untoward had taken place.
</P>
<P>
   Time may have rendered the object of Bunuel's satire a bit
obscure. The haute bourgeoisie whose fastidiousness he so lovingly
lampoons _ the recipe for a dry martini punctiliously offered by
Jean-Pierre Cassel is the director's own _ has faded into
obsolescence. The correctness of their manners may inspire more
nostalgia these days than derision, but if you look around, you
might notice the stealthy traces of Bunuel's influence in some
surprising places.
</P>
<P>
   His affectionate mockery, his reverence for feminine elegance
and the humanity at the heart of his ostentatious perversity make
him a sort of eccentric uncle to Pedro Almodovar. His Dada spirit
surfaces in ``Being John Malkovitch,'' just as his sense of
branching, overlapping realities resonates with the pop
inventiveness of ``Run Lola Run.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a spooky, primal dimension to the movie, an evocation
of childhood's deepest nightmares and richest sorrows, that may
remind you of ``The Sixth Sense.'' But the charm, at once elegant
and wildly indiscreet, is Bunuel's alone.

SENATE APPROVES TRADE DEAL FOR AFRICA AND THE CARIBBEAN  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine, W.Va., Mass., N.C.)  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT with DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate voted overwhelmingly Thursday to grant
broad new trading privileges to dozens of countries in Africa and
the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   The senators approved the measure in a 77-19 vote. The House
passed the bill a week ago by a 309-110 vote. The legislation,
which President Clinton is expected to sign shortly, will expand
duty-free access to U.S. markets for more than 70 nations.
</P>
<P>
   While Thursday's outcome was practically preordained, it was
nonetheless an occasion for celebration at the White House. Clinton
had made passage of the bill a high priority. And while the trade
measure ratified Thursday is totally separate from one to grant
normal trade relations to China, Clinton and other supporters of
the China bill hoped that the Africa-Caribbean accord would create
momentum for the China trade bill and show that Congress can act in
a collegial, bipartisan way on a major issue.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen Democrats joined six Republicans Thursday to oppose the
measure, with much of the opposition coming from lawmakers in
textile-producing states.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing lawmakers have argued that domestic-apparel companies
could suffer huge job losses because of relatively low-cost
imports. ``As cheap imports continue to flood the domestic market,
job losses will not only continue but increase,'' said Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., who opposed the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Maine's two Republican senators, Olympia Snowe and Susan
Collins, both considered less conservative than Helms, opposed the
bill. Democrats who voted no included Sens. Richard W. Byrd of West
Virginia and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill, in the administration and on Capitol
Hill, have argued that it will boost the economies and living
standards in poor countries of sub-Saharan Africa and the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker J. Dennis Hastert argued before the House vote that
passage would be practical as well as humanitarian. ``By promoting
expanded trade, the United States will be minimizing the need for
foreign aid and disaster relief,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Behind the overwhelming votes in both chambers lay more than a
little horse-trading. For instance, in a concession to U.S. textile
makers, the amount of duty-free textile imports will grow gradually
over several years. Other favors seemed to have little to do with
the Caribbean or Africa, like a provision on men's suits made from
Canadian wool.
</P>
<P>
   And U.S. drug-makers succeeded in having deleted from the bill a
section that would make anti-AIDS drugs available more cheaply in
sub-Saharan Africa, which has been devastated by the disease.
Clinton issued an executive order on Wednesday to do what the
deleted provision would have done.

 &HT;    INDUSTRY DIVIDED OVER DIVIDING MICROSOFT
 &HT;    470&AMP;add. Moving in the (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Microsoft's legal fate unlikely to be settled
any time soon, the high-tech world found itself divided Thursday
over what impact the antitrust case will have on its own future.
</P>
<P>
   Some have joined the Microsoft camp. They argue that by branding
the software giant as a lawless monopolist, U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson has shaken up one of the most dynamic
sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, they say, the court ruling has curbed investor
confidence and contributed to the sharp recent slide in high-tech
market values.
</P>
<P>
   Others applaud the government plan to cleave Microsoft in two,
which Jackson must now weigh, as precisely what's need to energize
high-tech competition and spur fresh cycles of innovative growth.
</P>
<P>
   And there's also a faction that regards the most watched
antitrust battle in decades as beside the point when weighed
against other concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, many of us are so involved now in trying to
create Internet technologies, the whole Microsoft scenario isn't
considered that important,'' said David Peterschmidt, president of
Inktomi, an Internet infrastructure firm.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Lewis, a veteran computer consultant and columnist, has
little sympathy for Microsoft's past behavior or for the quality of
Windows, the world's most widely used desktop operating system.
</P>
<P>
   But, he adds, ``Technology is moving so fast that by the time
this legal mess is resolved, consumers may not even notice or care
whether Microsoft is one company, two, or 57. The Internet, not the
desktop computer, is becoming the center of power.''
</P>
<P>
   As Lewis sees it, ``the operating system is just the dial tone
that you need to make a call to the Internet. Just as any phone
company can provide the dial tone for a telephone these days, any
company _ not just Microsoft _ can provide the operating system for
an Internet-connected device.''
</P>
<P>
   Those views are shared by the top brass at Microsoft even as
they revile the government's breakup proposal and ask the judge to
summarily dismiss it as a viable remedy.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, on Wednesday, when Microsoft offered up its own limited
remedial plan, co-founder and chairman Bill Gates was in Las Vegas
telling a trade show audience that cyberspace has become king of
the hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet will change more in the next five years than it
has in its entire history,'' Gates said. ``We're at the verge of
moving beyond the transaction phase into a phase where we think of
the Internet as (an applications) platform.''
</P>
<P>
   In Gates's mind, to be sure, that platform revolves around
Windows 2000. He showed the convention audience how the company's
new heavy-duty operating system, plus a cluster of related
products, address each of the areas that Microsoft sees as crucial
to the Internet's growth.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts who see merit in breaking up Microsoft nonetheless
see problems down the road. In the rapidly growing market for
Internet appliances, hand-held devices and wireless services, many
software engineers find it hard to divine where the operating
system ends and applications begin.
</P>
<P>
   While some insiders view Microsoft's conduct-based plan as more
realistic than the government's formula, they also fear that the
software giant wouldn't keep its side of the legal bargain.
</P>
<P>
   As Jesse Berst, a top online editor for Ziff-Davis, puts it:
``Fixing the Microsoft problem is a delicate operation. The
government proposes to use a meat ax. Microsoft's counterproposal
is better suited to the crime. But the company's conduct has proven
that we can't take halfway measures. Only cutting the company in
two will prevent it from committing more crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Todd Spangler, another Ziff-Davis analyst, holds that ``in
the unlikely event the proposed breakup of Microsoft holds up on
appeal many months from now, it would only prevent a singular
Microsoft from competing in the next generation of Internet-based
computing.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, said Jim Kobielus, an analyst at the Burton Group Corp.
in Midvale, Utah. ``Plenty of companies have built their businesses
on Windows-specific applications and have done very well with it,
so why should the Microsoft applications (company) be any
different? Just because the judge (might say) mommy and daddy can't
live together any more doesn't mean the children won't still play
with each other.''

 &HT;    INDUSTRY DIVIDED OVER DIVIDING MICROSOFT
 &HT;    470&AMP;add. Moving in the (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Microsoft's legal fate unlikely to be settled
any time soon, the high-tech world found itself divided Thursday
over what impact the antitrust case will have on its own future.
</P>
<P>
   Some have joined the Microsoft camp. They argue that by branding
the software giant as a lawless monopolist, U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson has shaken up one of the most dynamic
sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, they say, the court ruling has curbed investor
confidence and contributed to the sharp recent slide in high-tech
market values.
</P>
<P>
   Others applaud the government plan to cleave Microsoft in two,
which Jackson must now weigh, as precisely what's need to energize
high-tech competition and spur fresh cycles of innovative growth.
</P>
<P>
   And there's also a faction that regards the most watched
antitrust battle in decades as beside the point when weighed
against other concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, many of us are so involved now in trying to
create Internet technologies, the whole Microsoft scenario isn't
considered that important,'' said David Peterschmidt, president of
Inktomi, an Internet infrastructure firm.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Lewis, a veteran computer consultant and columnist, has
little sympathy for Microsoft's past behavior or for the quality of
Windows, the world's most widely used desktop operating system.
</P>
<P>
   But, he adds, ``Technology is moving so fast that by the time
this legal mess is resolved, consumers may not even notice or care
whether Microsoft is one company, two, or 57. The Internet, not the
desktop computer, is becoming the center of power.''
</P>
<P>
   As Lewis sees it, ``the operating system is just the dial tone
that you need to make a call to the Internet. Just as any phone
company can provide the dial tone for a telephone these days, any
company _ not just Microsoft _ can provide the operating system for
an Internet-connected device.''
</P>

A SHOWCASE FOR EMERGING TALENT NURTURED WITHIN THE SAME
ENVIRONMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Good business is the best art,'' said Andy Warhol,
who might have been an accountant if he hadn't been an artist. His
once-provocative words would probably sound common-sensical to an
MFA candidate today. At present they are serving as the title for
an exhibition at the Bronx Museum of the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   The show, organized by Marysol Nieves and Lydia Yee, celebrates
the 20th anniversary of the museum's Artist in the Marketplace
program (AIM, for short), intended to coach emerging artists in the
byzantine process of establishing a career.
</P>
<P>
   The program's drill is as follows. Every year, three dozen
artists are chosen to participate in a 12-week seminar led by the
museum's curatorial staff and an assortment of art world guests,
who advise on everything from landing a gallery to writing grants
to dealing with irksome realities like taxes and critics. As a
parting gesture, the museum gives the artists a group show, a
symbolic launching pad.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the future happens fast. Several recent program alumni
can be spotted in high-profile shows around town just now, from the
Whitney Biennial (Rina Banerjee, 1996), to ``Greater New York'' at
P.S. 1 (Mark Dean Veca, 1997; Nicole Awai and Nadine Robinson, both
1998), to ``Making Choices'' at the Museum of Modern Art (Katharina
Bosse, 1998, and Glenn Ligon, 1984).
</P>
<P>
   Three of Ligon's text-based paintings about racial identity open
the Bronx survey. Dating from 1990, they have acquired
near-canonical status in the art of that period, as has the work of
other AIM veterans seen here. Byron Kim's skin-colored abstract
paintings and evocations of Asian-American immigrant life by Tomie
Arai and Lynne Yamamoto are history book material.
</P>
<P>
   It may be hard to see such icons with fresh eyes in the context
of the Bronx Museum's episodic sampler. But it is intriguing to
learn that all of these artists were shaped by the same
institutional environment, and to find as one moves through the
rest of the show that their basic concerns continue to be explored,
if in more oblique terms, by their successors.
</P>
<P>
   Banerjee's ``Postcolonial-Spider-Broom Woman,'' for example, a
fantastic web of gauze, beads and industrial tubing, has many
things to say about the dangers and seductions of exoticism, but
says them indirectly. An installation by Ernesto Pujol titled
``Peter Pan's Table'' approaches the anxieties of a homosexual
childhood with sly, theatrical wit: sculptures of male genitals are
lined up like pastries on a little wooden desk, with a punishing
pair of scissors lying nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Lane Twitchell, who is in his early 30s, draws on his Mormon
background in imaginative ways. A substantial selection of his
output has been brought together here, from a straightforward
portrait painting he contributed to the 1997 AIM group show to some
of the elaborate, image-packed cut-paper pieces he has done since.
</P>
<P>
   The formal intricacy of Twitchell's recent work, with its
painstaking use of repetition and detail, finds echoes elsewhere:
in Seong Chun's sculptures crocheted from text-covered strips of
paper, in Valeska Soares's bundles of thorny branches swathed in
cotton batting and in Sarah Sosnowy's mural-size,
circles-within-circles mandala formed from dozens of smaller
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Painting has itself always held an important place in AIM
exhibitions, and it does so here. An anarchic, attention-grabbing
concoction by Fabian Marcaccio (silicone gel, printed fabric and
plaster are among the ingredients) stumbles off the canvas and
tears across the wall. By contrast, a sexy wall piece by Paul Henry
Ramirez is executed with the pin-point precision of an Islamic
miniature.
</P>
<P>
   Photography is the odd-medium-out here, though there are
first-rate entries by Laura Larson, and Bosse, who was born in
Finland, comes across as a particularly versatile artist. She is
represented by two very different architectural series made five
years apart, and neither resembles the striking figurative images
she showed at the Bronx Museum in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   These artists are just the tip of the AIM iceberg. Work by
dozens of their colleagues is also included in the roundup, in
slide format or displayed in flat files. The slides, set out on
light boxes, are a little difficult to see, but give a sense of the
sheer variety of sensibilities that have passed through the museum
over a couple of decades. The material in the flat files naturally
has a more immediate presence and is well worth spending time with.
</P>
<P>
   Several artists seen in the main exhibition are represented
here. But so are AIM graduates equally worthy of mainstage
attention, among them Brian Mukerjee, Nicole Carstens, Brian
Guidry, Skowmon Hastanan, Matthew Deleget, Max-Carlos Martinez,
Valerie Atkisson and Tamara Mewis. Some have gone on to bigger
things. They all look good here. And they are all part of an
important history.
</P>
<P>
   On July 13, the 20th annual Artist in the Market show will open
in the museum's lower galleries, and will run concurrently with the
anniversary gathering through the summer. They make sense together.
One speaks of solid accomplishment; the other promises surprises.
That's a business-as-usual combination for art in the Bronx.

`HELD UP' IS A PAINFUL COMEDY WITH FEW LAUGHS  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jamie Foxx began a successful comic career on TV, starring in
``In Living Color'' and ``The Jamie Foxx Show.'' While he did some
supporting bits in films like ``Booty Call'' and ``The Players
Club,'' it was last year's ``Any Given Sunday'' that really pushed
the young performer into the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   But, like fellow TV star French Stewart, who has had good luck
with ``3rd Rock From the Sun'' and who bombed in the excrutiatingly
awful ``Love Stinks'' last year, Foxx may find his carefully
planned trip to movie stardom more elusive than planned.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he needs to pick his properties more carefully.
``Held Up'' is a real dud, with few laughs, no characterization,
little story, a cluster of stereotypes and cliches and just plain
nothing for Foxx to do.
</P>
<P>
   He plays a successful Chicago businessman named Michael Dawson
who is vacationing with his fiancee, Rae (Nia Long), in the Arizona
desert. He has bought an antique auto and, when Rae learns he has
spent their future house down payment on the old beater, she takes
off, leaving Michael to fend for himself in redneck country.
</P>
<P>
   The inevitable bad luck occurs and Michael is taken hostage in a
botched convenience store robbery after his car is stolen and he
asks to use the phone. He's held captive with a bunch of white
trash doofuses and winds up becoming the brains behind the brawn _
all the while subjecting the viewer to the most moronic and
unimaginative sight gags going.
</P>
<P>
   The film is an insult to anyone with half a pea for a mind and
some notion of what constitutes narrative tension and successful
timing in comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Held Up. Directed by Steve Rash. Written by Jeff Eastin. Cast:
Jamie Foxx, Nia Long. Trimark Pictures. 90 minutes. Rated PG-13 for
mild violence, language.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: F

   EDS: EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY
</P>
<P>
   Standing tall in a roomful of first graders
</P>
<P>
   By Gary Borders
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ The first-graders at Cushing Elementary
were quietly working in their seats when I showed up. The teacher
was across the hall, so all eyes were on me as I walked in, feeling
self-conscious, holding a box filled with bags of Gummy Bears, a
stack of Sunday comics and a couple of children's books I would
read as a backup if I ran out of other tricks with which to
entertain a gaggle of 6-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   I stood there, feeling rather tall, a rare feeling for me. ``So,
are you our guest?'' one kid chirped up. I allowed as how I was.
</P>
<P>
   I was unaccountably nervous. My job involves a fair amount of
public speaking, at ribbon cuttings, civic clubs and for nine years
in a college classroom teaching journalism part-time. I've spoken
in front of several hundred people and not been particularly
nervous. Maybe I wasn't especially erudite or entertaining, but I
didn't waste a lot of time agonizing over it. Now here I was about
to speak to a couple dozen rug rats, and my palms were sweaty, my
heart racing.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher came back and introduced herself. I've adopted her
classroom for the next year, which means I have agreed to show up
on occasion to help out, maybe take the kids on a field trip or
two. When we talked on the phone, she was pleased but nonplussed as
to what I would be doing. That made two of us.
</P>
<P>
   I am my father's son. He couldn't wait until we kids became
adults so we could carry on intelligent conversations with him.
Same with me. As much as I loved my girls when they were little, I
identify with them a lot more now that they're allegedly adults,
albeit adults still on my payroll. Now I had a roomful of
bright-eyed and absolutely adorable children wondering what bag of
tricks I had brought on this rainy morning. I had visions of
children dropping off to sleep as I droned on about newspapers to
children who have just barely learned to read. At least I had the
Gummy Bears.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher introduced me and instructed her charges to sit in
their chairs, zip their mouths and open their ears in a cadence
well familiar to the children. The kids obeyed immediately.
First-grade teachers are doing God's work is all I can say.
</P>
<P>
   We started talking about the newspaper. The kids knew a
surprising amount about what's in a newspaper and began to
enthusiastically volunteer information. One little girl proudly
announced that she had once had her picture in the paper. Another
said his dad reads the stories to everyone each night around the
dinner table. The subject of recycling came up. I assured these
miniature environmentalists that we recycled our newspapers and
encouraged everyone to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   I loosened up. This crowd wasn't as tough as I thought it was
going to be. Probably what helped is that I could comfortably sit
in a little kid's chair and be at eye level with them. There are
advantages to being short.
</P>
<P>
   Now came time to delve into the bag of tricks. Using a cheat
sheet, and with a few false starts, I made a hat out of the
four-page Sunday comics section _ what's called a pressman's hat.
Press operators used to wear these to keep ink out of their hair,
though in truth I haven't seen somebody wear one in at least 20
years. Even though I had practiced several times, I still nearly
messed up. Pressure. Finally, I managed to get a hat made and
quickly crammed it on the head of a freckled-face boy wearing a
Dallas Cowboys jersey before it fell apart. He gave me a big,
gap-toothed grin in return. I left the instructions and some extra
newspapers for the teacher. No way was I going to try to make two
dozen hats while being watched by that many eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher had found a ``Curious George'' book that involved
the main character delivering newspapers by bicycle, so we all
gathered around while I read the story, punctuated with a steady
stream of comments from the kids. They are so innocent and
guileless at that age, taking joy in a simple story about a monkey
whose curiosity gets him in trouble time and again.
</P>
<P>
   Soon I was out of tricks and concluded by handing out the bags
of Gummy Bears, each of which came with a couple of balloons with
the newspaper's logo on them. The teacher kindly allowed the kids
to dig into the candy, which made both her and me extremely
popular. At her urging, the kids all clapped and then gave me a
``round of applause,'' which is a circular version of The Wave. I
promised to come back in the fall, though there will be a fresh set
of first-graders to meet.
</P>
<P>
   I'm looking forward to my next visit. Maybe I can learn how to
make a pressman's hat without looking at the directions by then.

<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ It must be hard for Judy Niewald Vasquez of
Gallup, N.M. to write a mean letter _ not that she would ever have
to. Her handwriting is so precise, so elegant and so proper that I
have no doubt that people go out of their way to be just as
courteous as she must be.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Vasquez writes, ``I grew up in southern Indiana in a town
of 700 people, but I think my childhood was not different from most
kids in small towns.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, read for yourself her list of ``remember when...''
</P>
<P>
   _ Everyone's mother and grandmother darned socks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Driving a pickup truck meant you were a farmer or rancher.
</P>
<P>
   _ Your mom kept a grease can, saving fried-out grease to use in
making lye soap.
</P>
<P>
   _ A family didn't buy anything they could make or grow.
</P>
<P>
   _ Listening on the party line was a common activity for farm
wives.
</P>
<P>
   _ Your dad worked six days a week and your mother cooked seven
days a week.
</P>
<P>
   _ You carried a coal-oil jug to the store to be filled so your
mom would have fuel for the stove to cook supper.
</P>
<P>
   _ You didn't drive anywhere you could walk to.
</P>
<P>
   _ Many elderly peoples' nightmare was that they would outlive
the money they had saved during their lifetime and no relatives
would take them in and they would end up at the county poor farm.
</P>
<P>
   _ You washed your clothes and your hair in cistern water to make
them softer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Velvetta cheese came in a wooden box.
</P>
<P>
   _ You heated your bathwater on the stove in a tea kettle.
</P>
<P>
   _ You make aftershave lotion by mixing some store-bought hand
lotion and rubbing alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   _ Your mom sent you for a bucket of water from the well just
before lunch so everyone would have cool water on a hot summer day.

`HELD UP': A FILM AND AUDIENCE HELD HOSTAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
By A.O. SCOTT    c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jamie Foxx is a witty actor and an intuitive comedian
who can sometimes manage to make the lamest material _ the WB
sitcom that bears his name, for instance _ amusing.
</P>
<P>
   As if to test his powers, ``Held Up,'' which might have worked
better as an episode of ``The Jamie Foxx Show,'' strands its star
in the middle of the Arizona desert (actually the outskirts of
Regina, Saskatchewan) with nothing to do but hold a gun to his own
head and negotiate with the North Butte sheriff's department on
behalf of the inept stickup man (Eduardo Yanez) who has taken him
hostage.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, causally directed by Steve Rash from what is a
moderately jokey script by Jeff Eastin, squanders some promising
possibilities and commits the inexplicable crime of separating Foxx
from his co-star, Nia Long, almost the whole time. In the opening
scenes, the two of them, playing Mike and Rae, a Chicago couple
vacationing in their newly purchased vintage Studebaker, show a
rare comic chemistry that turns explosive once Rae discovers that
he has squandered their nest egg on his cherished ride.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of fighting it out in the tumbleweeds, Rae hops onto a
pickup truck full of cowboys and spends the rest of the movie
drinking tequila in the Las Vegas airport, leaving Mike at the
mercy of a pubescent car thief, a passive-aggressive convenience
store owner, a gang of bumbling robbers and eventually a SWAT team.
</P>
<P>
   He's probably better off. Long, whose hauteur is an aspect of
her beauty, is nobody you would want to mess with, but she's a
perfect foil for Foxx's quicksilver riffing. He can shift, as if in
midair, from a strut to a grovel, and his funniest lines tend to be
the ones he mutters under his breath, taking back whatever foolish
boast that just popped out of his mouth. Behind his narrow eyes you
can see a darting, improvisational intelligence. If only he used
more of it in selecting his projects.
</P>
<P>
   The fun of ``Held Up'' is all in the setup, which plays off the
barely suppressed panic a black man might feel finding himself
stranded in a remote spot populated by strange white people who
assume he must be either a criminal or a celebrity. A young
videogame player decides Mike must be Puff Daddy, and soon the
local news is reporting that Mike Tyson is involved in a hostage
situation out in North Butte. But the movie's farcical momentum is
taken prisoner along with Mike and his fellow shoppers, who include
a mystical biker type (Michael Shamus Wiles) and a sweet blond
woman with a purse full of condoms (Sarah Paulson).
</P>
<P>
   The actors, to their credit, work hard to help Foxx squeeze what
sparks he can from a static situation that consists of two groups
of people staring each other down through plate glass windows (soon
shot away for the convenience of the cameras) and waiting for the
next thing to happen. There is an exploding hot dog, a dead body in
a crate, a skunk and a flesh wound caused by a piece of Cool Ranch
Dorito shrapnel, but the steady accumulation of absurdity that is
necessary for real farce is missing.
</P>
<P>
   The audience is made to sit around, like the townspeople who
have gathered outside the store, hoping to hear a good joke or two.
And there are one or two, which I won't ruin for you. But by the
end, even the irrepressible Foxx seems tired and defeated, and we
can only hope he perks up in time for his next movie.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of ``Northern Exposure,'' meanwhile, may enjoy seeing Barry
Corbin and John Cullum, who played the astronaut and saloon keeper
of Cecily, Alaska, reunited on the big screen, playing, of all
things, a sheriff and a shopkeeper. If only someone had thought to
bring along that moose.

`HUMAN TRAFFIC' TAKES A TRIP INTO THE HIGH LIFE WITHOUT THE
COMEDOWN

<P>
   Justin Kerrigan knows his rave scene. The Brit native makes his
feature debut writing and directing ``Human Traffic,'' a portrait
of the chemical generation in Cardiff, Wales.
</P>
<P>
   Five funky twentysomethings leave soul-killing customer service
jobs behind every Friday night for a weekend of, in the words of
film spokesman Jip (John Simm), ``clubs, pubs, drugs and party!''
</P>
<P>
   Jip, who works at a Gap clone by day, guides us through his
weekend Odyssey like a hopped-up Homer. He's a master of
ceremonies, introducing us to his crew, interpreting local custom
and explaining the fine points of club culture in narrative asides
and comic skits.
</P>
<P>
   While some of these gags are inspired, Kerrigan's approach is
literal minded and hampered by colorless scripting and a
frustrating tendency to milk every joke dry.
</P>
<P>
   Jip's mates includes best bud Koop (Shaun Parkes), a would-be DJ
rapper who pushes overpriced American vinyl on local kids like a
hip-hop P.T. Barnum; Koop's fast-food drone girlfriend Nina (Nicola
Reynolds), who despises her robotic job; live-at-home layabout Moff
(Danny Dyer), who wears his unemployment like a self-deluding badge
of moral courage; and LuLu (Lorraine Pilkington), Jip's gal-pal,
whose mantra that she's just fine being single, thank you, doesn't
fool anyone.
</P>
<P>
   They all drop Ecstasy, chase it with pints of ale, head for the
hottest club in town and top it off with a night of great sex. Not
exactly a cautionary tale, and the closest Kerrigan comes to even
moderating his portrait is odd-man-out Moff's throbbing hangover
and the completely contrived observation: ``We'll all outgrow this
soon, when the comedown is worse than the high.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a certain honesty in his celebration of restless youth,
if not exactly a thoughtfulness, and his embrace of sensory
pleasures and irresponsible fun should connect with his target
audience. He embraces his characters, and there's no doubt that he
lives and loves the milieu. What he misses is the spark, the
sensibility and creative charm of the other, better films that
inspired him.
</P>
<P>
   For all his flash and fantasy, Kerrigan lacks the profane poetry
and dangerous edge of ``Trainspotting'' and the sheer sense of
surprise of ``Go.'' What's left is a bubbly, high-spirited paean to
the joys of pharmaceutical phun that grooves to a throbbing beat
but constantly trips over flat, prosaic dialogue and literal,
lifeless sight gags.
</P>
<P>
   Human Traffic. Directed and written by Justin Kerrigan. Cast:
John Simm, Lorraine Pilkington, Shaun Parkes, Nicola Reynolds,
Danny Dyer. Miramax. 100 minutes. Rated R for language, sexual
themes, brief nudity and drug use.

LOGIC IS LOSER AS HUMANS FIGHT FOR FREEDOM IN `BATTLEFIELD EARTH' 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ``Man is an endangered species,'' alerts the introductory card
to ``Battlefield Earth,'' the adaptation of L. Ron Hubbard's ``Star
Wars''-inspired, epic sci-fi novel. It should have warned us that
logic was also hitting hard times.
</P>
<P>
   It is the year 3000. After a millennium of brutal subjugation by
the Psychlos (seemingly an unholy mating of the Klingon and Ferengi
races from ``Star Trek''), humans live like cavemen in the
irradiated wilds, foraging through a dying Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Rebellious young Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper, in flowing
locks and an unchanging expression of determined sincerity)
searches for a better land and discovers a race of intergalactic
corporate pirates, 8-foot alien slavers sucking the planet dry of
resources in the name of profit.
</P>
<P>
   Terl (John Travolta) is an especially devious Psychlo, with a
plot to make a fortune mining a cache of gold discovered in the
wilds. Psychlos can't breathe the air so they live under a dome
pumped full of their homeworld gases and the radiation reacts with
their chemistry, so greed and arrogance get the better of common
sense.
</P>
<P>
   Terl teaches scrappy Jonnie the whole of Psychlo knowledge,
gives him a spaceship, and sends him out with a pack of humans to
secretly mine the vein virtually unsupervised. Cocky is one thing,
but this egocentric complacency stretches credulity even for these
swaggering space pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Jonnie uses the time to search for American military bases
(amazing how those planes and armaments survive the centuries
intact and juiced up), turn savages into expert jet pilots on the
seven-day training plan, and plot the freedom of humankind from the
vicious slavers. Can't you just see Mel Gibson in the role
screaming ``Freedom!!!'' to a bunch of primitive guerrillas
wielding machine guns and lobbing missiles?
</P>
<P>
   Travolta has the time of his life as the blackmailing Terl,
tossing his head back to cackle every time he achieves the perfect
double-cross. Forest Whitaker, is his dim assistant, fumbling and
groveling as a junior-league con-artist constantly outmaneuvered by
Terl. This toxic Abbot and Costello team provide much-needed comic
relief in an otherwise humorless paean to freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Director Roger Christian, a former production designer and set
decorator, creates a world of crumbling dead cities and empty malls
turned into human hunting grounds but constantly trades logic for
effect. After a thousand years of occupation, we're supposed to
believe this technologically advanced, supremely crafty and
ruthlessly efficient race is still holing up in the decaying
remains of human civilization? These guys can't even fit through a
doorway!
</P>
<P>
   They're also not very bright. They can't be _ the plot depends
on the most ludicrous decisions and senseless actions ever made by
a thinking race. How else can a plucky tribe of hunters and
gatherers defeat the most powerful race in the galaxy? Heart, soul
and courage will get you only so far _ what you really need is an
enemy so stupid they invite their own demise. And a few Harrier
jets don't hurt either.
</P>
<P>
   Battlefield Earth. Directed by Roger Christian. Screenplay by

 spacey sly, delightful in small-scale `big kahuna'  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: B  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With his ``American Beauty'' success, Kevin Spacey has finally
achieved something like superstar status, but he's smart enough to
realize that his true appeal _ and long-term future _ lies in
playing quirky characters in commercially risky, heavily dramatic
situations.
</P>
<P>
   So, instead of cashing in his Oscar for a $20 million salary and
a string of bloated Hollywood comedies and action vehicles, he's
appearing this year in two _ possibly three _ small-scale,
low-budget art films made by his own production company, Trigger
Street Productions.
</P>
<P>
   The first of these, and the first film for which he's taken a
solo producer credit, is ``The Big Kahuna,'' a low-low budget,
three-character drama that was shot in a single New York City
studio set last February on a Roger Corman schedule: a mere 16
days.
</P>
<P>
   Adapted by chemical engineer-turned playwright Roger Rueff from
his own play, the film takes place in a hotel hospitality suite
rented by a industrial lubricant company at a convention in
Wichita, Kan., where three marketing reps are out to snare a vital
new account: the big kahuna of the title.
</P>
<P>
   Spacey plays Larry, a brash, successful, 40ish hustler who seems
to genuinely enjoy the thrill of the chase, never asks himself too
many probing questions about life, and is prone to outbursts of
irony delivered in that irresistibly cynical Kevin Spacey style.
</P>
<P>
   His partner and long-time pal is Phil (Danny DeVito), a recently
separated veteran in his early 50s who has gradually tried of the
hypocrisy and indignity of the sales game, and finds himself
increasingly pondering the futility of his existence in
introspective asides.
</P>
<P>
   And the catalyst for the drama is Bob (Peter Facinelli), a pious
young fundamentalist Baptist at his first convention, who finds
himself in instant conflict with the values of the older salesmen
and refuses to compromise his principles to snare the kahuna.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 90 minutes, Larry tears into Bob, Bob retaliates in
his own inadequate way, and the increasingly melancholy Phil tries
to moderate. In the process, all three characters regularly reveal
new levels of their inner selves, and ultimately learn a valuable
lesson about life.
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly a great play, and its enigmatic, open-ended
conclusion is a bit of a letdown. Visually, first-time director
John Swanbeck has not even tried to cinematically open the
proceedings up, and the result never lets us forget its theatrical
origin.
</P>
<P>
   But the dialogue is delightfully acerbic and often profound,
Spacey is a delight to behold in this kind of slyly aggressive
role, and he's generous enough as a producer to allow DeVito to
quietly steal the movie with the most totally appealing and
seemingly heartfelt performance of his career.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Kahuna. Directed by John Swanbeck. Screenplay by Roger
Rueff, from his play. Cast: Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, Peter
Facinelli. Lions Gate. 90 minutes. Rated R for language.

CBS MINISERIES `JESUS' IS RELEVANT AND REVERENT  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: B  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the Messiah portrayed as a party-loving, joke-playing
average guy and Satan done up like an Armani-clad, heavily moussed
Hollywood mogul, the CBS miniseries ``Jesus'' runs little risk of
being confused with anyone's idea of Sunday school.
</P>
<P>
   But lest we send viewers off in search of seemingly less
blasphemous fare, let them be advised that ``Jesus'' is more than
just all right. It is enjoyable, easily the best miniseries of the
May ratings period.
</P>
<P>
   Faint praise, perhaps. But director Roger Young, a veteran of
such biblical TV projects as ``Joseph,'' ``Moses'' and ``Solomon''
for producer Lorenzo Minoli, has made ``Jesus'' relevant and
reverent.
</P>
<P>
   Someone out there will likely disagree after watching two hours
Sunday and two more next Wednesday. But this is hardly the eyebrow
raiser that, say, ``Jesus Christ Superstar'' was nearly 30 years
ago. Nowhere in this two-night ``epic event'' does Herod Antipas
demand of Jesus: ``Prove to me that you're no fool; walk across my
swimming pool!''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, artistic license is taken. But mostly to good effect. Take
the character Livio. If memory serves, he doesn't show up in the
gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke or John. But he's hard to miss in
``Jesus.'' A Roman spy in Herod's court, Livio is the story's
facilitator, passing along plot points rooted in biblical history
even though Livio himself never existed.
</P>
<P>
   It's the sort of dramatic contrivance currently under attack for
wringing the credibility out of such ``true story'' films as ``The
Hurricane'' and ``The Insider.'' But, in the right hands _ not to
mention in a story where hard facts are hard to come by anyway _ it
can work wonders.
</P>
<P>
   Director Young chose a favorite of his, G.W. Bailey, to play
Livio. Known to many as the scheming Sgt. Rizzo from the later
years of ``MASH'' (or the moronic Capt. Harris of the ``Police
Academy'' films), Bailey has appeared in several of Young's
projects, including ``Solomon'' and ``Ruby Ridge: An American
Tragedy.'' In ``Jesus,'' he makes Livio an obsequious sycophant who
kisses up to higher-ups, the kind of weasel who makes Judas
Iscariot look like an OK guy.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey's scenes with the estimable Gary Oldman, who plays
Pontius Pilate, help raise ``Jesus'' from the pile of May-sweeps
detritus that inevitably clutters the schedule. It is the rare
miniseries these days that bothers to pay serious attention to
developments outside the realm of the principal characters, but
Suzette Couture's script does noble justice to the personae of
Pilate, Herod (Luca Barbareschi) and even the high priest Caiaphas
(Christian Kohlund), who starts out as a heroic defender of the
Jewish faith but ultimately succumbs to the political realities of
his office when Jesus proves too charismatic a figure to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the usual lack of Semitic-looking people, ``Jesus''
is a worthy addition to the film industry's biblical canon, gently
imparting the message that faith in the unknowable does not take
destiny out of the hands of the faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Though Jeremy Sisto almost underplays the title role in the
quest for regular-guy authenticity, he effectively conveys the idea
that a God who requires people to make their own choices in life
isn't a mean God, just a demanding one.
</P>
<P>
   If Jacqueline Bisset deserved an Emmy nomination for her barely
noticeable maternal turn in ``Joan of Arc'' last year, she deserves
canonization for her portrayal of Mary, the mother of Jesus. Since
the miniseries focuses on the adult Jesus, Bisset's Mary is already
comfortable in the knowledge of her son's ultimate mission, and
Bisset graces the role with a subtle strength that makes CBS look
brilliant for scheduling Part I on Mother's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Although Debra Messing is miscast as Mary Magdalene _ Stefania
Rocca, who plays Mary of Bethany, might have been a better choice _
the film does succeed on the strength of potent characterization,
right down to Jeroen Krabbe's jarring Satan.
</P>
<P>
   Young chose to dress Krabbe in modern attire _ a ploy that
smacks of silliness unless one considers Christ's temptation in the
desert to have been the sort of troublesome reverie in which
reality is the first casualty. And when one thinks of the
alternative Satan _ a guy in red leotard with horns and a barbed
tail _ the black business suit is devilishly on point.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus. Four-hour, two-night miniseries about the life of Jesus
Christ. Starring Jeremy Sisto, Jacqueline Bisset, Gary Oldman and
Debra Messing. Sunday and Wednesday at 9 p.m., CBS. Parental
guideline rating: TV-PG.

 &HT;    'WALL OF GUN DEATHS' UNVEILED TO HIGHLIGHT GOALS OF MARCH
 &HT;    Eds: The notation (underscore) in the Web address at the end
stands for that symbol.
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Adding a dramatic backdrop to their push for gun
control, organizers of the Million Mom March joined some of the
nations' mayors Thursday at a memorial wall bearing the names of
4,001 victims of gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the forgotten casualties of a silent war,'' said
Mayor Anthony Williams of Washington, comparing the ``Wall of Gun
Deaths'' to the memorials for Vietnam and Korean war veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``These victims unfortunately died for no great cause. They
didn't die in some far-away conflict. They died on our streets.
They died in our neighborhoods,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The names on the wall came from a report by the U.S. Conference
of Mayors that sought to quantify gun deaths in the first 11 months
since the April 1999 massacre at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The black wall _ 12.5 feet high and 54 feet long _ is standing
in two pieces on a large stage on the National Mall, the
centerpiece of Sunday's rally for ``sensible'' gun control.
</P>
<P>
   The Mother's Day event is expected to attract 150,000 marchers
to the nation's capital as well as hundreds of thousands to similar
rallies in 67 other cities, including Atlanta and Austin.
Organizers believe this march will be the largest rally ever for
gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Among the names on the wall, written in chronological order of
death, is that of Blake King, who died last year at 17.
</P>
<P>
   His uncle, Mayor Scott King of Gary, Ind., told the story of his
nephew's death. What started as a fist fight between two teenagers,
he said, ended up with one of them running next door, grabbing his
father's unlocked gun and shooting Blake in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Visibly emotional, King recalled the young man's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different ball game when you sit in a church,'' he
said, ``and you hear sobbing behind you and it's your own children
sobbing for the loss of their cousin.''
</P>
<P>
   King thanked the ``mothers of America'' for their grass-roots
campaign to stop gun violence. He noted it was also mothers who
``stepped up and stood up and spoke up'' years ago to begin what
has become a successful campaign to reduce drunk driving.
</P>
<P>
   The mayors' report is based on the responses of 100 cities to
requests for information. Several large cities, such as New York
and Los Angeles, were not included in the survey, which means the
total number of gun deaths since Columbine is likely much higher.
</P>
<P>
   Among the cities surveyed, Chicago reported the most deaths at
415, followed by Detroit with 364 and Baltimore with 245.
</P>
<P>
   Some cities reported only homicides, while others included
suicides and accidental shootings. Of the 4,001 reported, 658 were
suicides and 25 were accidents.
</P>
<P>
   About one-fifth of the names on the wall belong to people under
21, including 791 people 11 to 20 years old and 25 children under
11.

 &HT;    Tax plan may work against Bush
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ George W. Bush's proposal for a huge tax cut may
turn out to be an albatross to his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush gave the first hint he was positioning himself for a
presidential campaign tax cut suggestion on Nov. 13, 1996, by
signaling he wanted to cut taxes in Texas. The governor surprised
Texas House and Senate leaders with whom he previously had worked
closely with a press release calling for a $1 billion Texas tax cut
in the legislative session beginning in January.
</P>
<P>
   It came just eight days after Republican presidential nominee
Bob Dole and tax-cutting evangelist Jack Kemp had lost to Bill
Clinton and Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Dole had been softened up in the 1996 Republican primaries by
multimillionaire Steve Forbes, who spent a lot of money promoting
his flat-tax idea. The Bush-for-president team could predict that
in 2000, Bush would need an antidote to a tax-cut proposal. What
better than its own?
</P>
<P>
   And so the trajectory for the GOP Iowa caucuses and New
Hampshire primary in 2000 was set.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's 1997 tax cut ran into trouble. Democrats insisted that
education spending be part of the bargain. Bush pleased educators
by going along. It passed the House. But the Republicans in the
Texas Senate killed it. Still, Bush wound up with the $1 billion,
two-year tax cut he'd asked for.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Bush tried again. He got legislators to hold teachers
to half the $6,000 raise they wanted to bring them up to the
national average and spend the rest of the budget surplus on a $2
billion two-year tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   It knocked only 60 bucks off the average Texas homeowner's
property taxes. But $2 billion looks huge in small states such as
Iowa and New Hampshire. Bush took his tax-cutter merit badge, plus
a proposal to cut federal taxes $483 billion over five years, to
those states early this year.
</P>
<P>
   But even in usually tax-shy New Hampshire, Arizona Sen. John
McCain had success with his argument that putting all of the
projected surplus from the hot economy into tax cuts ``is not a
conservative effort.'' McCain said at least some should be used to
shore up national security and pay down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bush won the nomination, his tax cut proposal is up to
$1.3 trillion over 10 years. Democratic opponent Al Gore maintains
Bush's ``tax scheme'' actually would cost $2.1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore charges the proposal ``has two problems _ it
has the wrong priorities and it's wrong for our economy.'' It would
cause interest rates to soar, the deficit to balloon and programs
such as Social Security, Medicare and education to suffer, Gore
argues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush tax plan could shatter confidence in our economy _
sending a message to the world that under George W. Bush, the era
of fiscal responsibility is over,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Bush's team has sought to buy some slack, using White
House predictions that the hot economy will produce an even bigger
surplus than had been projected earlier as evidence Bush's tax cut
can work.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a House Republican leadership proposal last year for a
smaller tax cut than Bush's ``fell flat on its face,'' pointed out
U.S. Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Waco, who sits on the House
Appropriations Committee. ``The American people had enough sense to
understand that you can't have a free lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican proposal had assumed no emergency spending for 10
years and less money for defense than President Clinton proposed,
Edwards said. ``And of course the Congress is adding to, not
subtracting from the Clinton defense budget. And Bush is promising
more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't see where Governor Bush can make his
trillion-dollar tax cut work in the real world,'' Edwards said.
``It approaches the `voodoo economics' that his dad talked about''
_ a reference to the elder Bush's 1980 campaign criticism of Ronald
Reagan's claim that he could spend more for defense, cut taxes and
still balance the budget.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the elder Bush changed his tune after becoming
Reagan's vice president, ``what President Bush said about voodoo
economics was true: The country tripled the national debt in the
1980s,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that most average persons want us to protect the
important programs, and reduce the national debt,'' Edwards said.
``And ironically, it's put the Democrats into being more fiscally
conservative than the Republicans. And that could be Bush's
Achilles' heel.''

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Darkness was falling, I was alone and, I was
pretty sure, lost. The bamboo forest I was walking through was said
to be chock-full of Bengal tigers. I could feel the hair standing
up on my arms. I sensed there were hungry eyes out there in the
forest, watching me.
</P>
<P>
   I've always maintained that commercial adventure-travel trips
are an oxymoron: you pay the outfitters a lot of money to make sure
you don't have an adventure. You spend the cash to guarantee, as
much as possible, that you don't wander down the wrong trail, that
you sit down to a hearty (and hygienic) hot-cooked supper each
evening and that you're back in the office, safe and sound, right
on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Adventure is what happens when things go wrong, when the outcome
is in doubt, when you're forced to rely on your own wits and skill
to extricate yourself from a dicey situation. I'm a big fan of
so-called adventure travel trips, but I don't confuse them with
true adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as I was discovering as I felt my way down the dark
forest path, sometimes on these trips things really do go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Geographic Expeditions, a San Francisco adventure travel
company, had secured a permit to visit a previously off-limits
corner of Bhutan, a Buddhist kingdom in the Himalayas between India
and China, and had invited me along on a scouting trip. Ostensibly
our goal was to locate the world's highest unclimbed mountain,
which had somehow gone missing, but the real joy was walking
through breathtaking country no Western eyes had ever seen before.
</P>
<P>
   As we were leaving Thimpu, Bhutan's somnolent capital, we met
with World Wildlife Fund officials who told us a just-completed
census had found that the cloud-draped bamboo forest we'd be
walking through harbored Asia's third-largest population of Bengal
tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Big cats were much on my mind one afternoon as I ambled down a
muddy yak-herders' trail along the frothing river known as the
Chamkhar Chuu. Lost in a little wild-things reverie, I was idly
scanning the mud and the gravelly riverbank for paw prints.
Suddenly I heard a crashing in the bamboo. Out of the corner of my
eye I saw something springing toward me; there was a blood-curdling
roar.
</P>
<P>
   Gotcha! It was Jim Sano, one of our trip leaders. With my heart
about to explode out of my chest, I clubbed him with my bamboo
walking stick as he had a good laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at dusk, it occurred to me that I hadn't seen anyone for
hours. I had been walking without a halt since lunch, and it seemed
like I should have long ago reached our agreed-upon camp, a meadow
called Petso. Had I overshot it?
</P>
<P>
   I continued down the trail, inching my way along in the fading
light, when I stumbled into a half-drunken Bhutanese man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Petso?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   He looked confused and then gestured back the way I had come.
Then, looking a little unnerved to be out on the trail at that
hour, he disappeared into the forest.
</P>
<P>
   Dusk was feeding time for tigers. I stood and listened, willing
myself to make out the sounds of my group's camp. Instead, all I
could hear was something crunching through the bamboo, fortunately
far off. I couldn't possibly have walked past the camp without
seeing, I decided. I kept walking. Soon it was pitch black.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like I was going to have to spend the night out alone
in tiger country.
</P>
<P>
   I began to take inventory: I was carrying plenty of warm
clothing and rain gear, so hypothermia wouldn't be a problem. I had
almost a liter of water and a PowerBar for sustenance. I had a
headlamp with fresh batteries, and a lighter and toilet for
starting a fire.
</P>
<P>
   I flipped on my headlamp and continued down the forest path,
keeping an eye out for one of the shallow caves the local
yak-herders use for shelter. These, I'd noticed, often had a small
pile of firewood stacked nearby. I could get a roaring blaze going
to ward off the tigers.
</P>
<P>
   This sounds strange, but I was rather enjoying myself. The thing
about true adventure, the reason people get addicted to adrenaline,
is that it focuses your mind and sharpens your senses in a most
marvelous way.
</P>
<P>
   The forest, I noticed for the first time, was full of exotic
scents; I could hear every crunch and crackle in the bamboo, every
tiny change in the pitch of the river. I'd walked over 20 miles
since breakfast, but I felt a surge of new energy, an extra spring
in my stride.
</P>
<P>
   And then I rounded a corner and almost knocked over Tashi and
Karma, two of our Bhutanese camp-helpers who had been sent out to
look for me. Camp was half a mile farther, they explained. Petso
had been full of leeches, so the guides had decided to keep going.
</P>
<P>
   Soon I was sitting down to a hot, three-course dinner at a
folding table inside our spacious dining tent. Tashi and Karma were
setting up my tent for me and unrolling my cushy sleeping pad and
goose-down sleeping bag.
</P>
<P>
   Things were under control; my little adventure was over before
it had begun. I felt relieved and a little sad.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ An elfin, top-hatted statue perched high on a
venerable red-brick building at Houston and Lafayette Streets leans
over the sidewalk, holding a mirror above the passing crowds. The
gold-leaf figure is Puck, the playful sprite of Shakespeare's
``Midsummer Night's Dream,'' whose mischievous spirit animates the
building that takes his name and the scene below on which he muses.
</P>
<P>
   For along Houston Street, Puck, who proclaims ``What fools these
mortals be!'' has a rich array of humanity to marvel at _
finger-snapping jazz-hounds, 4 a.m. pool sharks, dancing fools,
fools waiting behind a velvet rope to start dancing, very pregnant
folk singers, walkers, poseurs from Soho (south of Houston),
shoppers from Noho (north of Houston), gardeners, noshers,
moviegoers of every stripe _ and a handful of sinks for the bar and
bathroom, if not the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   If this be folly, play on.
</P>
<P>
   By night and by day, for a river-to-river slice of city life as
varied and colorful as the mondo-maki fare at Sushi, Houston Street
is unrivaled. By night, where else could one find what in many
cities would be impossible _ a $9.95 lobster dinner a few doors
down from hearty Tibetan cuisine, just a stroll away from
headlining rap and folk artists and films both conventional and
controversial?
</P>
<P>
   By day, one can find arguably the world's best knish, urban
garden and barroom bar. Not to mention more playgrounds than you
could shake a stickball at. Plus water views, the arch of bridges
spanning the East River in the shadow of the Lillian Wald and
Bernard Baruch housing projects and the majestic expanse of the
Hudson as it widens into the Narrows.
</P>
<P>
   The street is kind to filmgoers, offering two fine houses. At 18
W. Houston is the Angelika Film Center, where one can take in
anything from the latest foreign movie to more mainstream fare. It
has the feel of a bohemian multiplex, with its beret tipped to more
eclectic tastes in both film and food, selling vegan baked goods
upstairs and decent popcorn downstairs. Do obey the signs and
refrain from wearing Rollerblades here!
</P>
<P>
   Across town, the Film Forum (209 W. Houston) feels much homier,
and its offerings tilt a bit more to the avant-garde and the
socially conscious. The latte-sipping crowd at the Angelika is a
mix of college students and middle-aged adventurers. At the Film
Forum, you could expect a younger Woody Allen waiting in line for
``The Sorrow and the Pity.''
</P>
<P>
   It was here that, along with my fiance, Pete Newman, who
accompanied me on my trans-Houston journey, I caught ``The
Specialist,'' Eyal Sivan's chilling documentary on the Eichmann
trial.
</P>
<P>
   For music, our favorite was the Mercury Lounge (217 E. Houston),
tucked in the back of what was once the servants' quarters to the
Astor Mansion, then later a tombstone store. One monument remains
embedded in part of the bar's countertop. The night we visited the
music room, which felt as if it were lighted by exit signs, we
found comfortable seating, famously good acoustics and Sara
Hickman, the Texas singer-songwriter who sat with her guitar right
up against her very round belly, making us wonder how her lively,
pleasing music sounded to the child growing inside.
</P>
<P>
   Xena Night and Hip-Hop
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks east, we poked into Meow Mix (269 E. Houston),
which features Xena Night every second Tuesday, for watching the
warrior princess. Most nights it's a lesbian bar, but not
exclusively so, especially on evenings with bands that attract a
broad audience.
</P>
<P>
   And for an active dance scene with a DJ, crystal chandeliers and
music ranging from hip-hop to techno to contemporary, there's the
nightclub Chaos in the old Provident Loan Society Building, which
once housed Jasper Johns' studio (225 E. Houston). The club has
just introduced a new modern-style lounge downstairs, in contrast
with the Oriental-rug, red-velvet Old World of upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   On the west side, the Zinc Bar (90 W. Houston) has a wide
variety of live music. For a good Cuban singer, there's Xiomara, on
Thursdays.
</P>
<P>
   At S.O.B.'s, at Houston and Varick Streets, I'm afraid we looked
too suburban as we stepped up for admission to Large Professor Plus
Mad Skilz.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, this is hip-hop,'' one bouncer warned us. ``Rap
music,'' the other added, in case we didn't get it. The first one
frisked Pete, but the second one waved his colleague off, as if we
were obviously too green to be packing heat. Inside, the music was
pounding with urban energy as the professor talked his lyrics at a
virtuosic pace. The only thing that shocked us, frankly, was the
cost of two run-of-the-mill drinks _ $15. When we left later, we
noticed the windows on Houston rattling with the bass.

</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (EDS: New grafs 7-12 with Thursday testimony.)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SETH ROSENFELD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The head of the company that prints San
Francisco's daily newspapers testified that he passed to Hearst
Corp. executives in New York a warning from some members of the
Chronicle board of directors that they better act quickly if they
wanted to buy the morning paper.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination, Steven B. Falk, president of the San
Francisco Newspaper Agency, said he passed along the tip he
received from Alan H. Nichols Jr., who was then on the Chronicle
board.
</P>
<P>
   Falk said Nichols, then chief financial officer of the Chronicle
Publishing Co., indicated that Hearst should make a fast bid for
the Chronicle before some of its owners sold other properties and
decided to keep the paper.
</P>
<P>
   In a booming voice, attorney Joseph M. Alioto asked, ``Did Mr.
Nichols tell you in sum or substance that the Hearst Corporation
should act quickly because the Chronicle family members might find
themselves flush with cash and decide to keep the Chronicle?''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was that indication, yes,'' said Falk.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony came Wednesday in former mayoral candidate Clint
Reilly's antitrust suit to block Hearst from buying the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Falk, whose testimony continued Thursday, was a key witness for
Hearst and the Chronicle as they began their defense to Reilly's
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Falk said Thursday under questioning by Alioto that in May 1999
the newspaper agency made an internal study showing that, if The
Examiner closed, the agency's revenue after costs of publishing the
Chronicle would increase by about $20 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The study assumed that closing The Examiner would cut 208 jobs
at The Examiner and the newspaper agency, Falk said.
</P>
<P>
   Falk, in an interview after his testimony, said the study was
only ``an exercise on paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Cuthbertson, executive officer of the Northern California
Media Works Guild, also said he viewed the study as a ``theoretical
look,'' adding that the current union contract with the Chronicle,
Examiner and agency provides for no layoffs and does not expire
until 2005. By then, he said, any excess positions would most
likely have been eliminated through attrition.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Shriver, a Hearst spokeswoman, repeated Thursday Hearst's
public promise that all current employees of The Examiner, the
Chronicle and the agency are guaranteed jobs if Hearst buys the
Chronicle and sells or shuts The Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto claimed after Wednesday's hearing that the information
passed by Nichols had been meant to thwart Chronicle shareholders
who wanted to keep the 135-year-old paper in family hands. Nan
Tucker McEvoy, a major shareholder and former board chair, had once
declared the Chronicle would be sold ``over my dead body.''
</P>
<P>
   Nichols, now president of Mountain View Internet firm Geocast,
could not be reached for comment Wednesday. Falk denied that there
was anything wrong in the communication between him, Nichols and
the Hearst Corp. So did Gregory Lindstrom, a Chronicle lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Falk runs the San Francisco Newspaper Agency, created in 1965 to
oversee a joint operating agreement between Hearst, which owns The
Examiner, and the local Chronicle Publishing Co.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Falk's agency collects all revenue, and
handles all printing, circulation and marketing for both papers.
After paying for the joint operations, the agency splits the
remainder evenly between each paper, which pays the costs of its
independent editorial staff.
</P>
<P>
   Joint operating agreements are allowed under the 1970 Newspaper
Preservation Act, an exception to antitrust laws meant to keep
alive newspapers that otherwise might fail so communities could
benefit from multiple editorial voices.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco agreement was set to expire in 2005, but the
Chronicle's owners last year decided to sell to Hearst for $660
million.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's suit claims Hearst's plans to buy the Chronicle and
sell The Examiner to the Fang family, publishers of the
thrice-weekly San Francisco Independent, would create an illegal
newspaper monopoly that would reduce editorial and economic
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly contends Hearst's agreement to give the Fangs a subsidy
of up to $66 million over three years to offset costs of publishing
The Examiner is a sham, because it is not enough to make the paper
a viable competitor to the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst has denied the allegations and claims The Examiner could
not survive outside its profit-splitting agreement. Since it is a
failing enterprise, Hearst may legally shut or sell it and buy the
Chronicle, Hearst says.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Halling, a Hearst lawyer, put Falk on the stand in an
effort to prove The Examiner would fail outside the agreement and
that the surviving Chronicle would still face fierce competition
for some of the $1.3 billion in advertising in the nine Bay Area
counties.
</P>
<P>
   Falk testified that the two San Francisco dailies are in the
middle of one of the nation's most competitive media markets, and
face competition for advertising and readers from a dozen suburban
papers as well as television, radio, cable and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Key competition comes from Knight Ridder, the newspaper chain
that owns the San Jose Mercury News and the Contra Costa Times, and
which Falk called ``the evil empire.''
</P>
<P>
   Falk said The Examiner's and Chronicle's joint operating
agreement crippled the larger Chronicle, which in effect subsidizes
The Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   On cross-examination, though, Alioto forced Falk to concede that
the agency has no actual figures that separate the shared revenue
and costs of each paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no measurement specifically,'' said Falk. Alioto
turned to a June 22, 1999, e-mail that he said showed Falk had
passed inside information from Chronicle director Nichols to
Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   In it, George Irish, head of Hearst's newspaper division, told
Hearst President Frank Bennack Jr.: ``Today, Steve Falk relayed a
conversation he had with Dick Rosenberg, who was in the Chronicle
board meeting about the discussion on the decision to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rosenberg told Steve that they . . . ended up with the
expectation that Hearst would make their best offer very quickly,
instead of waiting until all the other offers were in . . .Dick
told Steve that there is still a great deal of longstanding dislike
of Hearst among some of the shareholders and a strong offer up
front could lead to their acceptance without the longer process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve told me that Rosenberg opined that if we waited until
the end of the process, they may find themselves flush with cash
and decide to keep the Chronicle,'' Irish wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Falk testified that he never spoke with Rosenberg, and that
Nichols had dropped by his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a somewhat casual hallway conversation,'' Falk said,
``though it was clear to me the message . . . was . . . Rosenberg
and other board members are hoping Hearst steps up to the plate in
an aggressive way quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Irish happened to phone Falk the next day, and Falk passed the
hint along without mentioning Nichols as the source, he testified.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto has contended that Hearst abused its position within the
joint operating agreement to get the Chronicle at lower than market
price. Hearst and the Chronicle have denied that.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Hearst retained former U.S. District Judge
Charles B. Renfrew to review ``editorial policies`` at The Examiner
and whether suspended Examiner Publisher Timothy O. White violated
journalistic ethics by offering Mayor Willie Brown favorable
treatment in The Examiner's opinion pages in exchange for Brown's
support of Hearst's plan to buy the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Chronicle and Hearst asked Walker on Wednesday
to dismiss Reilly's suit, saying he lacks legal standing to bring
it because he has shown no injury from Hearst's plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, Mr. Reilly apparently does not have enough of a stake
in his own case even to testify,'' said Halling. ``Number two, Mr.
Reilly, who purports to be trying to save The Examiner, is not even
a subscriber to The Examiner.''
</P>
<P>
   Alioto claims Reilly has standing to sue as a consumer of both
papers who would suffer higher subscription and advertising rates
if Hearst gets the alleged monopoly ownership of the Chronicle, and
as a private attorney general protecting the public.
</P>
<P>
   Walker put off a decision on the motion.

 NEW YORK: the bass.

</P>
<P>
   For night owls in search of a landing spot, there's Soho
Billiards at Houston and Mulberry Streets. Though pool aficionados
complain that it looks more like a car dealership than a cozy,
traditional tucked-away pool hall, it has an ample supply of tables
and is open until 4 a.m. on weekends. We were not charmed by the
funky, terribly dusty, stucco ceiling and the odor of a soggy
rec-room; we'd hoped to see more characters and fewer
regular-looking people. But once we found two cue sticks that were
acceptably symmetrical, we had a couple of enjoyable midnight
games, for only $10 an hour for two.
</P>
<P>
   `So Come In Already'
</P>
<P>
   Daytime brought a different look to Houston Street. Pete and I
made a five-and-a-half-mile round-trip trek across the
thoroughfare, from the artistically renovated Broadway-Lafayette
subway station along the south side, east to the East River, and
then back along the north side and west to the Hudson. Finally, we
returned east to our starting point at the subway stop.
</P>
<P>
   Our journey, along the border between the named streets south of
Houston and the numbered streets to the north, took us through an
urban kaleidoscope that had served as way station and home to waves
of immigrants from Jews and Hispanics on the East Side to Italians
on the West, to the hip and arty in recent decades. We marveled at
random, captivating images: a lady carrying an armful of
pussywillows, a dog being hand-fed a hot dog, the shaggy calf and
foot of a man receiving a streetside pedicure, a cormorant floating
peacefully on the East River, a pondful of turtles at a community
garden, a shredded prom corsage in the gutter under a tunnel-like
building near the West Side Highway and colorful seven-story murals
on the sides of buildings.
</P>
<P>
   One recent Sunday we headed east from Broadway _ which divides
east from west on Houston Street _ because it was early in the
afternoon and because Pete loves knishes. Ages ago, he had heard
about Yonah Schimmel's (137 E. Houston) and the fresh knishes that
rise from the basement on the dumbwaiter: sweet potato knishes,
``buy them for the party'' chocolate knishes, kasha knishes to go
or blueberry knishes at the tables. The descendants of people who
couldn't wait to leave the Lower East Side flock back to this knish
emporium between Eldridge and Forsyth Streets for the authentic
taste of Yiddish eats. ``So come in already,'' the store's Web site
admonishes.
</P>
<P>
   We proceeded east to Russ and Daughters (179 E. Houston), an
85-year-old family food tradition, which was likewise packed with
people ordering whitefish, garlic paste, goat cheese and caviar.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather was one of those Eastern Europeans who had a
hard work ethic but not much patience,'' said Mark Russ Federman,
55, who gave up his law practice to go into the business.
``Customers would come in like they still do and say: `I don't want
this! Trim the fat off that!,' and he'd reply, `Did I invite you?'
and throw them out. The business wasn't doing so well until he
brought in his three daughters. They'd stand behind the counter
smiling, and it was quite unusual at the time to see pretty young
women reaching into herring barrels.''
</P>
<P>
   Federman's mother, Anne, is the youngest of the three daughters,
who have all retired to Florida, ``in the same shtetl,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Farther east, three cats graced the merchandise at NY Bars and
Backbars (49 E. Houston), where one could buy an official, original
Automat machine, complete with the labels from the days when it
sold Manhattan cheesecake for three nickels. Across the street we
enjoyed poking through Manhattan Castles and Props (74 E. Houston),
offering bathtubs, subway signs, sinks and antiques al fresco, in a
caged-off slice of the sidewalk that gives it the air of being
slightly forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   A Community Garden
</P>
<P>
   My favorite block coincided with a bit of a thunderstorm. Just
east of the Bowery, we had arrived at the Liz Christy
Bowery-Houston Garden, named for the founder of the Green
Guerrillas who died in 1985 at age 40. As we strolled among the
community garden's apricot tulips, trilliums and nasturtium
seedlings in cold frames, we noticed a young man standing on one of
the rough-hewn, wooden public seats struggling to thread his
umbrella handle through the latticework above it. Satisfied, he sat
in the corner, and his beloved nestled her head beneath his
shoulder, under the open umbrella, protected from the rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place defies the city,'' Pete said, after we had counted
about a dozen turtles surfacing around the rim of the garden's fish
pond. The place is open to the public when there are gardeners
present, and from noon to 4 p.m. on Saturdays, and 6 p.m. until
dusk during the growing seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Houston Street was named after William Houstoun, a delegate from
Georgia to the Continental Congress of 1784 and _ more important
for naming purposes _ the son-in-law of Nicholas Bayard III, who
owned property on which the street was built. The spelling was
shortened in the 1800s, confusing tourists who mispronounce it with
a ``you'' sound, like the Texas city, as opposed to an ``ow''
sound.
</P>
<P>
   Early in that century, it was considered a rural and residential
enclave of ``uptown'' Manhattan, which later gave way to factories
and became a center for the printing trades. It was in this milieu
that the erstwhile humor magazine Puck thrived inside the 1885
Romanesque Revival structure at Lafayette Street built to house it.
The building was once also home to Spy magazine; it is now the
frequent host of upscale weddings and home to Pratt Institute's
Manhattan outpost.

 NEW YORK: Manhattan outpost.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The thoroughfare is unusually wide, especially by New York
standards, and, with a few more trees, could pass as a boulevard.
When Houston Street was widened, many buildings flanking the street
were sliced off, exposing the blank walls of their next-door
neighbors. On the south side, at the corner of Thompson Street, the
Japan Artists Society has sponsored a building-high mural of two
cats, with a city in the background, containing the following
announcement: ``A pondering feline is melting into the Socratic
skyline.''
</P>
<P>
   Architectural Jewels
</P>
<P>
   We strolled by McKim, Mead &AMP; White's 1894 Cable building at
Broadway, a jewel in the crown of the neighborhood's fabled
cast-iron district. The building, foot-stompingly beautiful and
believed to be designed by Stanford White, was once the powerhouse
for cable cars moving from the Battery as far north as 36th Street.
(Wheels 26 feet in diameter pulled the cables under Broadway.)
</P>
<P>
   After a short amble past I.M. Pei's New York University housing,
we came upon the anomalous Time Landscape at Houston and LaGuardia
Place _ a 25-by-40-foot fenced-in area depicting what Manhattan
looked like in more pastoral times. The pristine woodland was
created, then sealed off, by the artist Alan Sonfist, and
encourages reflection on what Houston Street might have been in an
earlier era.
</P>
<P>
   Another source of contemplation, two blocks west at Sullivan
Street, is the Church of St. Anthony of Padua, a reminder of the
neighborhood's Italian pedigree, which honors its patron saint with
a lively street festival in June.
</P>
<P>
   While playgrounds appear every few blocks, especially on the
east side with Hamilton Fish Park at Pitt Street and Sara D.
Roosevelt Park at Chrystie Street, I particularly enjoyed one for
dogs: the Mercer-Houston Dog Run Association, complete with hose
and a small dog pool, open by membership. This little park at
Mercer Street attracts quite a crowd of spectators when it fills up
in the late afternoons for a canine happy hour.
</P>
<P>
   Posters and River Views
</P>
<P>
   On our westward journey, once we crossed the Avenue of the
Americas, the feel of the street changed, becoming more like any
Greenwich Village lane than an arterial. On this western swing we
found a few pleasant surprises.
</P>
<P>
   We explored Alphaville (226 W. Houston), which specializes in
vintage toys and movie posters. I was particularly drawn to the
full sheets of Wacky Packs sporting stickers with such spoofs of
name-brand products as Gadzooka Bubble Gum and Botch Tape that I
had adored in grade school. The owners, Steve Karchin and Gary
Kraut, had traveled far and wide in their quest for ``childhood
artifacts,'' particularly from the 1940s, '50s and '60s.
</P>
<P>
   In true Manhattan fashion, public toilets and access to the
scenic riverfronts are as hard to find around here as a person
wearing fewer than three black garments. And be warned that gaining
access to river vistas at either end of Houston Street can be
daunting. Trying to get to the East River, we had to risk crossing
a traffic circle with inadequate crosswalks, as cars left the FDR
Drive. On the West Side, we walked confidently to the farthest
reaches of the Pier 40 parking garage, pretending we had left a car
there, so we could lean over the top-floor railing for a gorgeous,
albeit challenging, view of the Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   From Sushi to Cichetti
</P>
<P>
   For dining, by day or by night, Houston Street offers a wide
variety of choices, heavily weighted toward the West Side. We had
to keep heading back to the blocks between Macdougal Street and La
Guardia Place for the temptations of cheap lobster (El Paso, 134 W.
Houston), very affordable sushi ( Sushi, 142 W. Houston, with ample
avocado in the California rolls _ the mark of a good sushi bar) and
the lure of Tibet on Houston (136 W. Houston), offering an
appetizing cuisine we had never sampled. Check out the daikon
radish dishes.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks east, Arturo's Restaurant-Pizzeria (106 W. Houston)
offers live music most nights, outdoor seats and tasty pasta
dishes. For a nightcap there's Madame X (94 W. Houston), a moody
downstairs bar dressed all in red, which offers live music weekday
nights.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're around in the daytime, you might want to pick up
some gnocchi at Raffetto's (144 W. Houston), one of New York's
oldest pasta makers.
</P>
<P>
   On the East Side we couldn't resist the 1940s appeal of Sunday
brunch at Katz's Deli (205 E. Houston), still conjuring up its
wartime slogan: ``Send a salami to your boy in the Army.'' We
could, however, send back the foul, poorly diluted orange juice
from concentrate. The perfectly browned blintzes and authentic
knishes made up for that, as did all those letters from recent
presidents, blown up to five feet in height, thanking the owners
for all the salamis.
</P>
<P>
   On my way to a party farther east on the Lower East Side, I was
hard-pressed to find inspiring dinner choices, and ended up at the
Clinton Restaurant (293 E. Houston), where the shrimp salad was
good and plentiful, the avocados were unavailable and the
wallpaper, of faded pheasants and mountain scenes, was probably
older than everyone in there. It was here, south of the border of
Alphabet City, that I got a pungent taste of the street's Hispanic
flavor. Marc Anthony and Luis Vargas played on the jukebox, and the
menu was presented in both Spanish and English, with more Spanish
spoken.
</P>
<P>
   We followed the crowds to Cafe Colonial (73 E. Houston), which
features Brazilian cuisine, though that's not obvious from the
decor, which favors old advertising signs in English. The Brazilian
beer was dark and copious, the hearts-of-palm salad with Roquefort
cheese attracted the forks of everyone around the table, and the
steaks were very well received.
</P>
<P>
   For gracious atmosphere, Ballato Restaurant (55 E. Houston) and
Bar Cichetti (220 W. Houston) ranked high. We liked the way the
maitre d' at Ballato welcomed some of his patrons by name, ushering
them in to the warm dining room, with its distressed plaster and
Old-World feel.
</P>
<P>
   At Bar Cichetti, the yellow walls, done half in bead board,
formed the perfect backdrop for the two bottles of Veuve Clicquot
our friends bought to toast our engagement.

TO ACT, PERCHANCE TO WRITE

<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest movie ``Hamlet'' is set in contemporary New York,
where the troubled scion is heir to a media conglomerate called the
Denmark Corp. and an aspiring filmmaker himself.
</P>
<P>
   More striking than all of the up-to-the-minute electronics and
sleek Manhattan locations, however, is the palpable youth of this
production's melancholy Dane. Ethan Hawke, not yet 30, is the
youngest actor to play Shakespeare's best-known character in a
major motion picture. And it takes nothing away from Laurence
Olivier's, Mel Gibson's or Kenneth Branagh's interpretations to
note that something about this feels incredibly right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the reason why a lot of people have a caricature of
Hamlet in their minds as a self-involved, infantile kind of guy is
because, oftentimes, you're watching somebody much too old for the
part play it,'' says Hawke, who has essentially embodied the
literate soul of his generation in such zeitgeist movies as ``Dead
Poets Society,'' ``Reality Bites'' and ``Before Sunrise.'' ``If
you're watching a young man do it, his obsession with trying to
define his relationship with his mother and father, his trying to
figure out who he is in relationship to the world ... It's just a
young man's dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael always said that he saw Hamlet, set in this modern
way, more as a Holden Caulfield or Kurt Cobain than as a Laurence
Olivier at 40,'' Hawke continues. ``I happened to have loved
Olivier's Hamlet, but there's a great line in `Catcher in the Rye'
where he talks about Olivier playing it more like a general than
the screwed-up kid he thought he was. I kind of took solace in that
line.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael is Michael Almereyda, the New York experimental
filmmaker who adapted and directed the new ``Hamlet.'' He
collaborated with Hawke on the movie's script, location choices
(whoever had the idea to set the soliloquy in the ``action'' aisle
of a Blockbuster video store should take a bow) and thematic
emphases.
</P>
<P>
   All that and whatever other ideas the theater-trained (though
Shakespeare inexperienced) Hawke brought to the party were welcome.
But it was the callow sensitivity he projects so well that made
Hawke perfect for the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the tradition of casting the play has warped the idea
of who can play it in the movie, because to sustain all of that
language for 4 1/2 hours every night might require an older and
more experienced actor,'' Almereyda observes. ``But there are all
kinds of ways for younger people to be fresh for Shakespeare in
movies because the discipline is different. What's really required
_ and what I went for with Ethan _ is a level of intimacy, so the
lines weren't spluttered and declaimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ethan brought that intimate quality, as well as a young man's
vulnerability, to the piece, and that felt new to me. The hope, for
both of us, was always to present a complete person that you'd feel
sympathy for, that it wasn't just someone filling the part.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, youthfulness isn't the only quality that makes
Hawke's movie Hamlet distinctive. The actor has his own, unique _
some would say heterodox _ take on many aspects of the play and
character. Most crucially, on Hamlet's legendary indecisiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has this extraordinary dilemma of being told to kill
somebody by his father, and I don't think Hamlet is wrong not to
want to do it,'' Hawke reckons.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Ghost comes to tell Hamlet to kill Claudius, we
usually assume that he should kill Claudius. My whole idea was,
y'know, being a vigilante is not necessarily the best idea,
especially for a basically peaceful man. Even in the original text,
they're all talking about how he's not an amazing warrior like his
father, that all Hamlet wants to do is read.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's to say that he should just go blast Claudius? I think
putting it in a modern setting helps you to feel the reality of
that more. When it's set in the olden days, you just think
everybody killed each other, and he should just go stab the guy.
But when it's like, OK, here's a gun, go shoot him, it makes you
understand a little more viscerally why Hamlet's having an
existential dilemma.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawke's co-stars include Kyle MacLachlan as the murderous,
usurping uncle Claudius; Diane Venora as Hamlet's mother, Gertrude;
Sam Shepard as his father's Ghost; a surprisingly effective Bill
Murray as Polonius; Julia Stiles as Ophelia; and Liev Schreiber as
Laertes.
</P>
<P>
   As you may have noticed, it's an all-American cast, which Hawke
feels complements the movie's modern vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all kind of excited about that, because people in this
country can be such Anglophiles when it comes to Shakespeare,'' he
says. ``We think only the British know how to do it right, and
everybody gets really intimidated by that. So it was fun to have
this kind of renegade group of American actors running around New
York doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, I feel like, whatever you can do to make it
personal and heartfelt is good,'' he adds. ``If it's too scholarly,
if it's too put in a box, then I think people go to sleep. You
know, Shakespeare wasn't meant to be high art. A lot of people
would enjoy it more than they (think) they would if it wasn't
treated so preciously.''
</P>
<P>
   Filming ``Hamlet'' in New York solved a few of Hawke's own
dilemmas. Since the birth of his daughter, Maya, almost two years
ago, the actor has made only one other movie, ``Snow Falling on
Cedars,'' and essentially abandoned Malaparte, the theatrical group
he helped found. The movie allowed him to work his theatrical
muscles without the all-consuming demands of a stage production
while staying close to the downtown loft that Hawke and his wife,
actress Uma Thurman, call home.
</P>
<P>
   ``A theater company is kind of like a family, and it's really
fun, but once you actually have a family, there isn't that much
time to do that,'' he explains. ``I used to do whatever I wanted,
and what pleased me the most was work. So I'd work 52 weeks a year
if I could; everything else was kind of boring. But now, I have to
do things that I find really challenging if it's going to take me
away from my family. So many things shoot in, like, Istanbul, and
that might have been fun when I was single. But now I have to be
more creatively discerning.''
</P>
<P>
   While Thurman recently filmed some movies in Europe, Hawke
contentedly tagged along and kept busy with parenting duties and
work on his new novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have one little, secret blessing, which is that I love to
write,'' he says, ``and I can, pretty much, do that wherever we
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawke's first book, ``The Hottest State,'' was published to
mixed reviews and much complaint about its author being a popular
young actor. Hawke has been dodging the pseudo-intellectual label
ever since.
</P>
<P>
   And he's not the least bit bothered by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to allow people to think that,'' he says. ``It's
constructive criticism in a certain way. You know, it was so much
easier for me to get a book published than it is for anyone else
that I should take that heat and take it gladly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that time will tell whether or not I'm serious,'' he
adds. ``But I also think, in general, that we live in a period when
people are just so cynical and mistrustful of your intentions. I
really don't consider myself an intellectual. I do love to read,
and if that makes me an intellectual, then I guess I am. But
there's also some idea that you're an intellectual because you
don't love the living of life. That's not the case with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to our concluding question: What does Ethan
Hawke want his future to be or not to be?
</P>
<P>
   ``I started when I was so young that I feel like the challenge
for me is to not burn out and to stay fresh,'' says Hawke, who made
his first major movie, ``Explorers,'' while still in junior high in
Princeton, N.J.. ``In the past couple of years, I've tried to
recultivate in myself the attitude of an amateur. For any person
involved at all with the arts, I think it can be really damaging if
you turn yourself into too much of a businessman.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounding like something out of the luxe, Manhattan ``Hamlet,''
Hawke continues: ``We live in a culture where the only barometer
for success that anybody really respects is money. But I think that
can't be the only criterion by which you judge yourself, or you'll
just be a miserable rat ... and you really won't be an artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``My idea, really, is just to try to live the most interesting
life that I can and accept whatever comes.''

WHERE UNICORNS AND TAPESTRIES WAIT IN TIMELESS REPOSE

time between Israel and New York, is a columnist for The Jerusalem
Post.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The most beautiful European cloister I've ever
experienced lies along the Hudson River, just south of the Bronx
border. The Cloisters and I were introduced in early May of my 11th
year, a season when the transplanted monastery gardens in Fort
Tryon Park explode with color.
</P>
<P>
   Our sixth-grade class had studied the social, political and
economic structure of medieval Europe with a thoroughness that
years later could carry us cold through college examinations. We
had spent the interminable dark winter immersed in the Middle Ages,
hardly raising our heads to see if the 15th century ever arrived.
</P>
<P>
   We passed our weekends assembling bulky scrapbooks, scavenging
our parents' bookshelves, buying up secondhand magazines on 42nd
Street. In gold and peacock watercolors, we painstakingly adorned
with gothic lettering the individual compendiums of our year's
work. Our ``medieval books'' were displayed for admiring parents in
the school library with a seriousness and pomp matching that of the
rare-book room at the British Museum.
</P>
<P>
   In May our class set out in a yellow school bus with bad shocks
on a bumpy crusade up the Henry Hudson Parkway. The Cloisters wing
of the Metropolitan Museum of Art is more than a reproduction of a
medieval microcosm that any come-lately millionaire could hope to
construct in Arizona. Chapels and cloisters were transplanted stone
by stone from monasteries scattered throughout Europe. On a site
overlooking the New Jersey Palisades, they were rebuilt on the
biggest hill in New York near the highest-numbered streets in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The perfect haven of beauty abloom with fragrant blossoms, the
bubbling stone fountain in the center, the spring air limpid and
the sunshine sending warm rays upon our shiny childhood hair _ it
was my first aesthetic jolt.
</P>
<P>
   I've kept trying to recapture that platonic essence of cloister
ever since.
</P>
<P>
   In every European city I've run straight to every cloister
mentioned in each footnote of my guidebook. Predictably, my
expectations were forever higher than any mere human cloister could
deliver.
</P>
<P>
   In high school I dragged hapless friends on the endless trip
through upper Manhattan on the No. 4 bus. Finally it made a
majestic sweep into the circular driveway of the Cloisters; we
disembarked and forded the mental moat back to the Middle Ages. But
my friends always remained bewildered; reality did not match my
magical description. We hurtled noisily back downtown on the A
train.
</P>
<P>
   I introduced my two little girls to the Cloisters in exactly the
right spring season.
</P>
<P>
   Driving them in from the suburbs in my station wagon, I told
them over my shoulder of my mystical class trip and the wondrous
surprise that was awaiting them. But my little girls had never
heard of troubadours or Eleanor of Aquitaine, of stained glass
windows or illuminated manuscripts.
</P>
<P>
   They trailed blankly after me through the courtyards until their
patience wore out and they started to beg for Good Humors and tug
my arm toward the gift shop.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, I took my first daughter to the Cloisters on the
last sunny weekend before she left for college. I suspect I wanted
to take my parting from her by coming together to the womblike
gardens nestling hidden and comforting inside fluted arches. She
recognized the white unicorn, an old friend from the reproduction
of the tapestry tacked up on our kitchen cupboard, and said with
sparkling eyes that she would certainly come back in the spring to
see the rose trees flower.
</P>
<P>
   But for her the spring was years still in the future.
</P>
<P>
   It is suddenly spring again, a spring when I feel leaden and
pedestrian _ ages older than the springs of my Middle Ages. Among
the mail filled with offers of things I do not want I find the
bulletin of events from the Metropolitan Museum. One page near the
back lists hours, activities and location of the Cloisters. Tucked
at the bottom is an unobtrusive photograph of a flowering cloister
garden, almost begging to be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   I feel myself again walking in the orderly line of sixth
graders, holding hands, two by two, with the teacher at the head
and a chaperoning mother at the rear, wearing a starched cotton
dress tied at the waist, filing out from the cool vaulted halls
into the brilliant sunshine of the Cuxa cloister.
</P>
<P>
   What need have I to be moved by the fairyland beauty of foreign
castles along a foreign Rhine or to trudge with tourists through
congested Florence, when right next to the prosaic Hudson looms our
majestic medieval fortress controlling all of Manhattan Island?
Along with Manhattan, holding my old heart within its walls, a more
than willing captive.

`FORGET THE $20 MILLION _ GET ME WOODY'S $5,000'

entertainment column.)

prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Woody Allen
with Tracey Ullman in scenes from ``Small Time Crooks.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Julia Roberts gets $20 million a movie, and Leonardo DiCaprio
joins her in the financial stratosphere. Sean Penn, Michael Caine,
Hugh Grant, Drew Barrymore, Tracey Ullman and Kenneth Branagh all
get handsome paychecks for simply stepping in front of a camera.
 &HT;    But when Woody Allen comes courting, these Rolls Royces of
Hollywood turn into Volkswagens. Allen pays even the biggest stars
a miserly $5,000 a week _ and they line up to be in his films.
 &HT;    Everybody wants to do a Woody Allen movie, even though the parts
are often small, the perks are few and far between, there's
virtually no individual artistic input and, most of the time, he
won't even let them see a complete script.
 &HT;    In fact, he seldom even tells his actors what the film is about
_ which, he claims, most of them prefer.
 &HT;    ``Actors don't really want to read a full script,'' he says.
``All they want to know is what they're doing.''
 &HT;    But the prestige keeps them coming _ being in a Woody Allen
picture means you've arrived. Michael Caine took a huge salary cut
for ``Hannah and Her Sisters'' (1986), and it brought him an Oscar
as Best Supporting Actor. Last year Sean Penn got a Best Actor
nomination for ``Sweet and Lowdown.''
 &HT;    But Allen insists that he can't really get any actor he has a
mind to.
 &HT;    ``It's a 50/50 breakdown of actors who work in my movies and
those who can't or don't,'' says Allen, whose latest, ``Small Time
Crooks,'' will open May l9.
 &HT;    ``Actors want to be in my films,'' he admits, ``but they have to
be between jobs, because we don't pay them anything. Some of them
get 10 or 20 million dollars a picture. We give them $50,000 for 10
weeks' work. Everybody gets the same _ they don't get any
percentage of the picture, that's it. It's low-paying, and they've
got to want to do it.''
 &HT;    Hugh Grant, coming off the hit ``Notting Hill'' (l999), wanted
to do it as soon as he got a fax from Allen that said, ``I've
written a comedy that has a character who is a charming, well-bred
Englishman on the outside, but turns out to be a real bastard on
the inside. I thought you'd be perfect for it.''
 &HT;    ``I didn't know whether to take that as a compliment or an
insult,'' Grant says with a laugh during a separate interview.
 &HT;    Since he made his directorial debut with ``Take the Money and
Run'' (1969) _ like ``Small Time Crooks,'' a comic crime story _
Allen has become a legend in the business, making 30-plus films,
among them such classics as ``Annie Hall'' (l977), ``Manhattan''
(1979), ``Zelig'' (l983), ``Hannah and Her Sisters'' (l986),
``Crimes and Misdemeanors'' (l990) and ``Bullets Over Broadway''
(l994).
 &HT;    Nonetheless, the writer/director/actor has had to struggle to
keep his career afloat.
 &HT;    ``In many films I've gone over budget and have had to give my
entire salary back to the film company,'' he says. ``So I worked a
whole year on a film, writing, directing, editing it, for no money
at all. I've done it a dozen times.
 &HT;    ``So I've not gotten rich,'' he concludes, ``and neither has
anyone who has worked with me.''
 &HT;    The secret to his survival, he says, is his low budgets _
``Small Time Crooks'' cost a penny-ante $15 million.
 &HT;    ``The reason I get so much freedom, I can cast anyone I want to,
nobody reads the script and nobody says anything is because I'm
working at a financial level that they can't get hurt,'' he says.
``They could lose a little money, but not a lot.''
 &HT;    His latest film is one of the wildest comedies he's made in
years _ but Allen insists that he's never been the overly serious
Bergman wannabe that his detractors suggest.
 &HT;    ``I'm a comedian who makes comic films,'' he says. ``Some are
more serious, some are more frivolous. It's really just the roll of
the dice. My next film could be a comedy about death and famine,
for all I know. Some of my more serious movies are what I would
call a full-meal deal, as opposed to this one, which is a
souffle.''
 &HT;    The cast for ``Small Time Crooks'' includes Allen as an
ex-convict turned dishwasher, Tracey Ullman as his manicurist wife,
Elaine May as their cousin and Hugh Grant as a smooth-talking con
man. Allen and Ullman open a cookie shop as a front for a tunnel
into the bank next door, only to have the cookies make more money
than they could get from the bank.
 &HT;    Allen, who is nursing a cold _ ``I'm not a hypochondriac,'' he
insists, ``I'm an alarmist'' _ says that the idea for the movie
came to him when he read a story about a gang of thieves trying to
break into a bank from a next-door building.
 &HT;    ``I thought, what would happen if the little business they'd set
up took off like a rocket ship,'' he says, ``and they no longer
needed to rob that bank?''
 &HT;    Getting ideas is the easy part, Allen says. He learned to
generate ideas quickly as a staff writer on Sid Caesar's ``Your
Show of Shows'' in the 1950s.
 &HT;    ``Years ago, when I first started, you'd come in on the Sid
Caesar TV show on Monday morning,'' he recalls. ``You had to write
it by Wednesday, so they could rehearse Thursday and Friday,
because it went out on Saturday night. You couldn't sit around
waiting for miraculous inspiration.
 &HT;    ``My ideas come to me when I'm walking or shaving or at a
restaurant,'' he adds. ``I write them down, and then I go through
all my matchbook covers and napkins and say, `Which of these ideas
are going to be my next movie?'
 &HT;    ``So many of my films have happened that way,'' he says. ``If I
was a great writer it wouldn't be easy _ but on the level I write,
it's not hard for me.''
 &HT;    Allen has always insisted that his movies are not
autobiographical, although ``Husbands and Wives'' (l992), which
came out in the midst of his acrimonious breakup with Mia Farrow,
came uncomfortably close to his own personal domestic scenario.
``Deconstructing Harry'' (1997) seemed almost an autopsy of the
Allen psyche, and Kenneth Branagh did an out-and-out Allen
impersonation in ``Celebrity'' (1998).
 &HT;    Even Allen admits that his personal preoccupation with death
often creeps into his work, especially in films such as ``Crimes
and Misdemeanors'' and ``Hannah and Her Sisters.''
 &HT;    ``I've always been aware of the rapid passage of time _ the
finiteness of life, the inevitable conclusion of life for you and
your loved ones,'' he says. ``The imminence of illness _ those
things were always on my mind, ever since I was a little kid. I was
unusually preoccupied with it.
 &HT;    ``When I turned 50,'' the filmmaker continues, ``it was a magic
number _ and when I turned 60, I couldn't believe it.
 &HT;    ``You would think I shouldn't worry about it,'' Allen adds,
``because my father is 100 years old and my mother is in her late
90s. So I suppose it's all in the genes.''

VOLATILITY DRIVING YOU NUTS? HOSE DOWN YOUR PORTFOLIO 
</HEADLINE>
   (Financial Commentary)  
 By DAGEN McDOWELL  
 c.2000 TheStreet.com  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're afraid of wrecking your car, you stop speeding.
</P>
<P>
   If you're afraid of gaining weight, you stop eating doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   If you're afraid of volatility, you stop overloading your
portfolio with every marginally attractive tech stock you find.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few months, many investors have learned firsthand
what volatility means. One week the Nasdaq Composite Index plummets
25 percent. The next week it gains 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   You aren't imagining things. Market volatility has been moving
higher since the mid-1990s. As investors have pushed stock prices
to higher and higher multiples of their earnings, changes in these
companies' fortunes have resulted in larger and larger swings in
their prices.
</P>
<P>
   And these days, investors are trading more often and holding
their investments for shorter periods of time _ another
contributing factor.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't stand the recent swings in your portfolio, you can
reduce these fluctuations by turning to that basic tenet of
investing: diversification.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have a lot of the same stuff in your portfolio?'' asks
Pat Burke, principal in investment policy and analysis at Vanguard.
``If everything in your portfolio has gone in the same direction,
then you aren't diversified.''
</P>
<P>
   Simply, you want to have your money in securities or asset
classes that will not move in lock-step with one another.
</P>
<P>
   For example, airline and oil stocks are both volatile, but they
tend to move in opposite directions. When energy prices are high,
airlines tend to suffer because a big component of their cost
structure is fuel, but the oil names will do well. When energy
prices are low, the reverse will happen.
</P>
<P>
   BUOYANT BONDS
</P>
<P>
   To temper your high-growth tech stocks, consider adding some
bonds, international stocks or long-ignored value names to your
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds might sound boring, but they typically have a very low
correlation to stocks, meaning the two asset classes do not move in
tandem.
</P>
<P>
   And they are less risky. Theoretically, you get paid more for
taking on more risk. Since bonds provide less return, they carry
less volatility.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds do have risks tied to default, interest rates and
inflation, but they do have known cash flows. You know upfront how
much money a bond will pay you in interest from now until maturity,
plus you know you'll get back the bond's face value.
</P>
<P>
   Equities also have default, interest-rate and inflation risks,
but on top of that you don't know what that stock will make for you
over a given period of time, whether from dividends or a rise in
price, and you aren't assured of getting any of your money back.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would expect _ on average _ more volatility in stock
portfolios,'' says Andrew Lo, a professor at the MIT Sloan School
of Management and director of the Laboratory for Financial
Engineering.
</P>
<P>
   By adding bonds or cash to your portfolio, you will lower its
return but significantly reduce its fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
   For the five years ending April 30, a portfolio with 60 percent
of its assets in the S&AMP;P 500 and 40 percent in the Lehman Brothers
Aggregate Bond index would have produced an annualized return of
17.8 percent, compared with a 25.3 percent return for the S&AMP;P
alone, according to data from T. Rowe Price.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, your returns would have been about 30 percent lower with
the bonds (over an unusually strong period for the S&AMP;P 500 index),
but they would have come with 40 percent less volatility than the
all-stock portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Cash or Treasury bills will also help preserve your stock
returns. Neuberger Berman found in a recent study that if you had
half your money in Treasury bills (a cash-like investment) and half
in the S&AMP;P 500 index over the past 40 years, you would have
retained 76 percent of the market's returns with only half the
volatility.
</P>
<P>
   Realistically, you probably wouldn't want more than 20 percent
of your money in bonds or cash, assuming that you aren't retiring
in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schwab recommends a 5 percent cash allocation for its
most aggressive clients. For the most conservative investor, the
firm suggests keeping 25 percent in cash.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want to sell existing securities and possibly
generate capital gains, you can simply start directing new money in
a bond or cash investment. You can find a money-market fund at any
mutual-fund company or bank. For exceptional no-load bond funds,
you can inspect offerings from Vanguard or American Century. In
addition, PIMCO
</P>
<P>
   Total Return is a well-known intermediate-term bond fund. This
fund has delivered an average annualized return of 5.6 percent over
the past three years, which ranks it above 92 percent of its peers,
according to Morningstar. (It comes with a 4.5 percent front-end
sales charge, though.)
</P>
<P>
   INCHING OVERSEAS
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time to stop ignoring those vocal proponents of
international investing.
</P>
<P>
   Investing a portion of your money overseas will indeed cut some
of the volatility out of your portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   From 1960 to 1998, if you had 100 percent of your money in the
S&AMP;P 500, your return would have been an annualized 12 percent,
according to data from Vanguard. But if, over the same period, you
have put 30 percent of your portfolio in Morgan Stanley Capital
International's Europe, Australasia and Far East (EAFE) index, your
annualized returns would have been about the same 12 percent, but
the portfolio's volatility would have been 13 percent lower.
</P>
<P>
   Ned Notzon, who oversees T. Rowe Price's asset-allocation
Spectrum funds, typically keeps 20 percent to 25 percent of assets
in international stocks, but now that allocation is up to 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Domestic has been so strong that, in most of our
asset-allocation portfolios, we have an overweighting in foreign
equities because of the attractive prices,'' says Notzon.
</P>
<P>
   You can find a variety of international index funds at Vanguard.
The T. Rowe Price International Stock fund is another large,
well-recognized fund, or check out some lesser-known funds, like
Artisan International or Scout Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   GUTTING THE GROWTH
</P>
<P>
   Even if you have international funds in your portfolio, you
could still have too much of your money in growth stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Growth and value do move in definite cycles when growth beats
value and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   During the last six years, growth has been the dominant style.
But that will change sooner or later. ``In 1994, academic research
said growth was dead,'' says Vanguard's Burke.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, that didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to stop battling the volatility in your portfolio,
you may want to put half your money in growth and half in value.
``It would be much more tolerable,'' Burke says.
</P>
<P>
   How do you know whether a fund's style is growth or value? Don't
trust the name. Instead, inspect its holdings. See whether it holds
traditional value sectors, such as bank stocks, or check
Morningstar's style boxes.
</P>
<P>
   MORE SECTORS, MORE SMALL CAP
</P>
<P>
   You can further diversify your money by making sure you aren't
concentrated in large-cap stocks or in any one sector.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilshire 5000 index, which represents the entire U.S.
market, is a good proxy for what your portfolio should look like.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 25 percent of the Wilshire is in small- and
mid-cap stocks, while the remainder is in large-cap. Technology
only represents 33 percent of the index. If most of your money is
in technology, try increasing your weighting to other dominant but
less aggressive sectors, such as basic materials or even utilities.
The Select Sector Spiders, exchange-traded portfolios that track
specific sectors of the S&AMP;P 500, give you an easy way to increase
your weighting in a particular area of the market.
</P>
<P>
   STICKING WITH STOCKS
</P>
<P>
   If your stock portfolio is out of balance, but you're willing to
hold on to it over the long run, time is a great antidote to
volatility. Over 10 years or more, the ride will look a lot
smoother than it will over one- or two-year periods.
</P>
<P>
   If you can stand the churning, you may not need to do a thing.

BALLET AS CONCEIVED FOR A BRITNEY SPEARS VIDEO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ballet lovers are drawn to the art form for several reasons: the
extraordinary music; the physical beauty and athletic grace of the
dancers; and, most of all, the dance itself, with all its
imagination, challenge, drama and humor.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about the ballet in ``Center Stage,'' however, is
that it silences the two-left-feet dialogue and interrupts the
hoary story lines. It can't keep us away, however, from the
central-casting characters, who are such stereotypes it's like they
were created before dance itself.
</P>
<P>
   The movie _ like ``Fame'' in concept but certainly not in
execution _ details a year at a preparatory academy for the
American Ballet Theatre. The familiar characters include a clumsy
ingenue (Amanda Schull) who'll get her chance to shine
(coincidentally, also a recent plot on ``The Simpsons''); the
earnest newcomer (Sascha Radetsky) and creepily seductive teacher
(real-life ABT star Ethan Stiefel) who vie for her affections; the
prima donna (Susan May Pratt) who suffers from bulimia and having
an ambitious stage mother; and the streetwise toughie (Zoe Saldana)
who'll be great if she can just get over such bad-attitude offenses
as chewing gum in class. Peter Gallagher, who must be thanking his
lucky stars for ``American Beauty,'' looks embarrassed as a hotshot
instructor.
</P>
<P>
   Even the dancing, which provides the movie's best moments (a
relative term), often has a watered-down feel to it _ ballet as
conceived for a Britney Spears video. But anyone with enough taste
and intelligence to enjoy the best of the dancing is going to
recognize the rest of ``Center Stage'' for the hokum that it is.
However, it's just entertainingly bad enough that you might enjoy
it if you can get enough friends together to make fun of it. One
campy midnight movie, comin' up!

winding down and time running out, his highly touted medical drama
is living out its worst possible scenario: It's on life support,
with its fate in the hands of others.
</P>
<P>
   After airing a dozen or so episodes and generating
less-than-inspiring ratings, the year's most widely dissected
midseason series is facing cancellation. CBS unveils its fall
2000-2001 lineup to advertisers next week, and odds that ``City of
Angels'' will be on it hinge on CBS President Leslie Moonves
sticking with a promise he made in November that if the series
staggers out of the ratings gate, ``we'll stick with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The melodrama, which aired Wednesdays and stars Blair Underwood
as a passionate surgeon struggling to keep a financially strapped
hospital from crumbling, drew extraordinary attention at the outset
_ and not just because Steven Bochco was one of the executive
producers or because a bulk of the episodes were being directed by
Barclay, a multiple Emmy-winner for his splendid work on ``NYPD
Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   The attention was based as much on politics as on the creative
reputations of those involved. With the NAACP circling the networks
because of an absence of African-American and Latino characters on
series television, anticipation swirled around ``Angels'' as
observers wondered whether such a high-profile drama featuring a
predominantly black cast could stay true to the authenticity of the
setting while not alienating white viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Because white households make up 79 percent of the television
audience and black ones only 12 percent, convincing a sizable chunk
of white viewers to become regular viewers is vital to any show's
survival.
</P>
<P>
   The networks, with the exception of the smaller and more
niche-heavy UPN and the WB, are reluctant to gamble on a series
that might attract far more black than white viewers because
advertisers have traditionally been lukewarm toward series with a
largely black viewership. (According to Nielsen Media Research,
about 20 percent of ``Angels''' 8 million viewers are not black. By
comparison, the audience for another midseason entry, ``Malcolm in
the Middle,'' is double that and 90 percent white.)
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Barclay and Bochco tried to sell the idea
early that ``Angels,'' while set in a Los Angeles hospital with
mostly black doctors treating black and Latino patients, wasn't a
black drama but ``a drama that happens to have black people in
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Such an assertion, many black producers say, merely illustrates
the challenges facing series populated by non-whites _ how, for
instance, black- and Latino-oriented programs must worry about
being too racially and culturally exclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Farquhar, who created ``Moesha'' and is now co-executive
producer of ``The Parkers,'' both on UPN, calls such attempts to
shed ``the black show label'' a producer's way of getting around
the so-called black tax, a kind of inevitable bounty levied against
shows whose viewer base is almost exclusively black, and therefore
``far less valued'' by advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Parkers,'' a broad comedy based on a mother and daughter
attending the same college, has in its first season become the
most-watched series in black households, attracting close to 4
million viewers a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets good ratings by UPN standards but doesn't attract the
demographic advertisers, so therefore doesn't get the respect it
deserves,'' says Farquhar. ``When I read about the shows doing a
lot for their networks, it's `West Wing' for NBC and `Judging Amy'
for CBS. We're practically invisible. Why is that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``City of Angels'' has been far from invisible, but that hasn't
helped it with advertisers or viewers. As to why white viewers have
for the most part stayed away, Barclay says there's often a
perception that shows about blacks will deal with race and
constantly blame white people for black people's troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me wrong: I'm not saying that's what happened
here,'' Barclay says. ``But no one is going to return to any place
where they are constantly being blamed. But it's frustrating for us
because that's not what we're about.''
</P>
<P>
   The overarching vision of ``Angels'' was not to do a show that
focused directly on issues relating to being black in America, but
to deliver a mainstream medical drama that would deal organically
with race through the experiences of the characters.
</P>
<P>
   This decision came less from a creative decision than from
Bochco's fear that a series, no matter the quality, would never
work if it was unwilling to follow the crossover rules.
``Mainstream audiences have never been particularly comfortable
with (race),'' says Bochco. ``Comedies work because they're
nonthreatening. They're not designed to delve deep. They don't
offend.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE
nn
</P>
<P>
   Recent TV history backs up Bochco's fears. In 1979, Bochco
created ``Paris,'' with James Earl Jones as a police captain and
criminology professor. The series, on CBS, was gone in four months.
Carl Weathers as a San Francisco police officer in ABC's ``Fortune
Dane'' lasted one season in 1986, and in 1995, Jones co-starred
with Joe Morton in the generally praised ``Under One Roof.'' The
series focused on a middle-class Seattle family, but CBS yanked it
after four episodes.
</P>
<P>
   With this in mind, ``Angels'' was written carefully _ and
therefore passively _ as it tried to balance the scales (a white
doctor feeling the kind of institutional racism blacks have always
complained about; a less-talented black resident crying racism when
a white counterpart gets better assignments) while offering a
traditional mix of romantic fallout, life-threatening medical drama
and bureaucratic nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   The series premiered with 13 million viewers in the Sunday time
slot of the popular ``Touched by an Angel,'' but it immediately
began to lose viewers with subsequent airings, including
African-Americans who thought the series was trying so hard not to
offend its white audience that it was sacrificing its cultural
pulse.
</P>
<P>
   ```City of Angels' is under tremendous pressure,'' says Yvette
Lee Bowser, who, as one of the few black female producers, created
``Living Single'' and ``For Your Love,'' and is expected to add the
comedy ``The Thing About Family'' to NBC's fall lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the torchbearer, so it's also the target everyone will
shoot arrows at. It has to be everything to everyone. But if you
try to do that, you end up being nothing to no one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thing is,'' adds Blair Underwood, who was a regular on
Bochco's ``LA Law,'' ``what it will take is a greater number of
dramas about blacks and Asians and Hispanics so that we no longer
look to one or two programs to be the end-all and be-all. Are you
shooting yourself in the foot to say you're a black drama? I don't
want to sound like the whining victim here, but, yeah, you are. It
should be about the quality of the work. That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about the quality of ``Angels?'' It may be that the
pervasiveness of medical dramas such as ``ER'' and ``Chicago Hope''
has made it difficult to mount a fresh medical drama, but
``Angels'' story lines have suffered from a sense of staleness. A
senior staffer commits suicide after learning that his services are
no longer needed; a patient refuses surgery that would save his
life. Love triangles between the lead characters. Its chief
distinction turned out to be simply the race of its characters.
(Bochco also blames the early 7 p.m. start time for story-line
``softness.'')
</P>
<P>
   Before finishing the filming for its season, ``Angels'''
producers sensed trouble. They shifted the tone of the series and
dropped the dark, drab backdrops, the darkly lit settings, and the
gospel music that filled the breaks. If the series returns for a
second season, Vivica A. Fox, who starred with Underwood as a
hospital administrator and love interest, won't return with it. The
two never clicked.
</P>
<P>
   An ``Angels'' return could also hinge on other minority-oriented
shows CBS places on the fall schedule. Gregory Nava's series about
a Hispanic family is said to be a lock. And with more black, Latino
or Asian leads set for the fall, CBS would feel less pressure
politically in the dispensing of ``Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the experience ``Angels'' has had is a largely bitter
one, it might have served a purpose. It's high profile and
difficulties, among many other factors, have helped propel
development of new minority series, and Barclay and Underwood could
eventually get their wish of having all dramas being just dramas.
</P>
<P>
   ``(We've) got to get away from having test cases every few
years, this whole black-drama-is-a-gamble notion,'' says Barclay.
``I firmly believe that if you put enough quality programming out
there, people will watch and say, `That's a good show.' Not a good
black show.''

KERRIGAN'S FILM CHRONICLES ONE OF HIS NUMEROUS INTRIGUING
EXPERIENCES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ When Justin Kerrigan walks into Breadwinners, the airy
and eclectic Dallas breakfast joint, he looks like he could be any
other McKinney Avenue denizen: close-cropped blond hair,
saucer-sized youthful blue eyes, T-shirt, khakis. The only thing
giving the 25-year-old director of ``Human Traffic'' away is his
Welsh accent, which graces the words that fly from his mouth at a
breakneck clip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human Traffic'' moves at the same pace. Kerrigan's film
follows five young proles through a dance-, drink- and drug-fueled
weekend on the rave scene in the clubs of Cardiff, Wales. The
good-natured movie is about ``release,'' a term that Kerrigan uses
often as he settles in for Breadwinners' version of eggs Benedict.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surprising thing about the film is that people of older
generations and people who've never been part of the culture seem
to be able to identify with it,'' Kerrigan says. ``So many people
begin with, `Oh, that's my friend. That was me and my mate.' So I'm
thinking, `Well, how? This is just a personal film about me and my
friends in Cardiff.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think every generation fundamentally goes through the
same things, the same sexual insecurities, the social paranoias. I
think everyone can relate to a lost weekend, to going out with
their friends and forgetting their 9-to-5 jobs, their family
stresses or whatever problems they got.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet at 25, Kerrigan has had experiences nobody else is likely to
share. Although he grew up in Wales, he attended school in Florida
when he was 9, returning to Wales to get involved with the club
culture when he was 15. He studied art and became interested in
film. By the time he was 18, he was raising money to buy a
secondhand camera to make short films, which helped him get into
the International Film School of Wales. He made six short films
before he received his degree; five of them made it to television.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan says all his films are at least semiautobiographical,
which is only fitting for a guy who is a natural storyteller. His
tales are so amusing, you have a hard time believing that they're
true, one in particular when he attended an arts event at Windsor
Castle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are celebrities everywhere, all British celebrities, and
I'm the only unfamous person there,'' Kerrigan says. ``And Jeeves
is walkin' around with the free martinis, and I'm gettin'
(hammered) ... I go down to the end of the Great Hall to get an
ashtray, and I turn around, and there's the queen right there. And
there's no security, and everybody's, like, mingling. So I'm
thinking, `This is a bit surreal,' and I'm the next in line, and
she's approaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I'm trying not to laugh; she goes, `Oh, hello, who are
you?' And I say, `Oh, I'm Justin Kerrigan.' And I put my hand out,
and everyone just freezes. I realize then, you're not supposed to
shake the queen's hand. So I'm looking at her, she's looking at me,
and I'm thinking, `You're not gonna leave me hanging here,' y'know?
And she shakes my hand after, and sticks around for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kerrigan isn't just all about parties and amusing anecdotes.
Although ``Human Traffic'' is a breezy jolt of adrenalin, he plans
something more serious with his next film. It's about his
relationship with his father, who recently died at 50.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just made me realize how short life is,'' Kerrigan says.
``If you've got time off, you'd better use it. It's so easy to just
get wrapped up in your job. It's those times where you actually
release and go out with your friends and look back and say, `Yeah,
I had a good time.' ''

 &HT;    Bush at the arms bazaar
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ When a top National Rifle Association official was
taped in mid-cackle saying that a George W. Bush White House would
mean a presidency ``where we work out of their office,'' Bush was
quick with a rebuke.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise there. The candidate is leaving yellow lines and
flat armadillos in his wake as he veers from the right shoulder to
the middle these days.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA's lip-prints are not what a candidate wants on his
collar when courting the women voters Bush must have.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that gun slaughter, particularly of children, rates
high among women's concerns. This is reflected by the Million Mom
March, a grassroots nationwide gun-control movement. Its showcase
event is this Mother's Day at the Washington Mall.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is Clintonesque in his ability to project empathy without
spending any. Undoubtedly right now he's figuring out a way to tell
these mothers, some of whom have lost children to gunfire, he feels
their pain.
</P>
<P>
   Gun carnage will always be a hard issue on which Bush can offer
any bold solutions. For one thing, he comes from a gun-happy state
in a gun-happy country. For another, he owes too many favors to the
gun lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bush ought to know that more than anything else a gun
issue is what he most owes for his national profile and his current
office.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was concealed firearms permits. While one can
overstate any single appeal to voters, it is clear that
``conceal-carry'' was the single most distinctive issue separating
Bush and relatively popular predecessor Ann Richards in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-gun forces did a good job of getting out the
conceal-carry vote for Bush amid an otherwise lukewarm turnout.
Bush won by 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Not to do time-travel games, but if Ann Richards had made a
devil-deal and said she was all for six-shooters on hips in Texas,
George Bush might still be just the eldest son of an

 &HT;    MILITARY RETIREES HOLD THEIR CAPITOL MUSTER, VOW TO RETURN
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ About 250 retired members of the armed forces held
a brief ``muster'' at the Capitol on Thursday to press their demand
for the lifetime health care they claim they were promised but
didn't get.
</P>
<P>
   After indignant speeches about Congress's failure to fund the
care they say recruiters promised them, the middle-aged and elderly
veterans made a strategic withdrawal to the weapon they are using
to stir up support for their cause: the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   They vowed to return in September with a larger group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here on borrowed money today,'' said retired Air Force
Major Billy J. Young of Fort Gratiot, Mich., ``because it's time we
let these people up here understand that we have been relegated to
second-class employees of the federal government ... and we're
tired of it.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar Senate bill, introduced by Sens. Paul Coverdell,
R-Ga., and John McCain, R-Ariz., has been signed by only 27
senators.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials, including Defense Secretary William Cohen,
have acknowledged that recruiters and military retention officials
routinely promised lifetime medical care to members of the Army,
Navy, Air Force and Marines who began careers prior to June 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Although military lawyers have acknowledged in court that the
promise was made, the Pentagon argues that it does not constitute a
binding contract by the government, and so far courts have agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Military base closings, which eliminated many military
hospitals, and federal budget cuts have left an estimated 1.8
million retired personnel and their dependents without the promised
care.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they are placed on the rolls of the department's
Tricare program, which requires them to pay a portion of their
care. When they reach age 65, they are placed on Medicare and told
that they must pay for their own prescription drugs and, if they
want outpatient care, pay $49.50 a month for the plan's Part B.
</P>
<P>
   Young has filed a lawsuit accusing the federal government of
unlawfully discriminating against retirees by failing to keep the
promise.
</P>
<P>
   Only one member of Congress, Rep. Ronnie Shows, D-Miss.,
attended the rally. Shows and Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., have
introduced a bill to fund the promised care. It has been signed by
more than 270 members of the House, more than enough to pass it.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Rear Adm. Jeremy ``Bear'' Taylor, 66, who came to the
rally from Ogden, Utah, said he continues to work as manager of the
Ogden airport because without his civilian health insurance, he
could not afford to pay up to $1,000 a month for medication for
this wife's rheumatoid arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This a great cause and we're working hard at it,'' Taylor
said, ``because people are dying as second-class citizens, even
though they paid their dues.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Priestley of Panama City, Fla., a retired Navy lieutenant
commander who organized the rally with a three-month e-mail
campaign, called on the group to go home, send out more e-mails and
return with their comrades for a bigger rally in September.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Army Sgt. Maj. Dempsey Henson, who received three Bronze
Stars and nine service-connected disabilities during his service in
Vietnam, came to the rally from Broomfield, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing fatigues, he carried a sign that declared Congress was
``ripping off'' the retirees' health care.
</P>
<P>
   After 1956, the law was passed to give military retirees who
enlisted after that time Tricare coverage rather than fully paid
health care.
</P>
<P>
   The bills in Congress would allow those who began careers after
the law was changed to enroll in the Federal Employee Health
Benefits Plan if they pay premiums equal to those paid by retired
civil service employees of the federal government.

&HT;     WITH A CHILD ON RITALIN, FAMILY STRUGGLES AGAINST THE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RICK KARLIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERNE, N.Y. _ Like thousands of children, 7-year-old Kyle
Carroll takes Ritalin for a diagnosis of attention
deficit-hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.
</P>
<P>
   And like thousands of parents, Michael and Jill Carroll worry
about the drug's side effects, including sleeplessness and loss of
appetite. But they keep their child on the medication, in part
because they fear child welfare workers will take him away if they
don't.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, administrators from the school district
called Albany County Child Protective Services, alleging child
abuse when the Carrolls said they wanted to take Kyle off the drug.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Carrolls are now on a statewide list of alleged
child abusers, and they have been thrust into an Orwellian family
court battle to clear their name and to ensure their child isn't
removed from their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beyond the point of whether he should be on it. Now it's
the point of them telling us what we're going to do,'' said Michael
Carroll. ``They're telling me how to raise my child.''
</P>
<P>
   The Carroll's dilemma is not unique. While there are no reliable
statistics on the phenomenon, observers say public schools are
increasingly accusing parents of child abuse and neglect if they
balk at giving their children medication such as Ritalin, a
stimulant being prescribed to an increasing number of students.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent report from the American Academy of
Pediatrics, as many as 3.8 million school children, mostly boys,
have ADHD. The disorder is characterized by a short attention span,
jumpiness and impulsive behavior. But many cases are misdiagnosed,
the study found. Additionally, at least a million children take
Ritalin and the use of the drug has risen many times more during
the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   Along with that increase, schools are using some heavy-handed
tactics on parents who may balk at the medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``The schools are now using child protective services to enforce
their own desires and their own policies,'' said David Lansner, a
New York City lawyer who has seen cases similar to the Carrolls'.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing is so scary,'' remarked Patricia Weathers, of
Millbrook, N.Y., a suburb of Poughkeepsie. Officials at the
Millbrook school district called police and child protective
services when she took her 9-year-old son, Michael Mozer, off
medications earlier this year. She said a drug cocktail including
Ritalin, the anti-depressant Paxil and Dexedrine, a stimulant like
Ritalin, caused her boy to hallucinate. ``My son was a guinea
pig,'' said Weathers, who now sends the child to a private school.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is relatively new but it's happening,'' said Peter
Breggin, a Bethesda, Md., psychiatrist, of the school districts'
legal tactics. Breggin opposes the use of Ritalin.
</P>
<P>
   Albany's child protective services didn't return phone calls
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we are unable to give our side of the story due to
confidentiality,'' said Steven Schrade, the school district
superintendent here.
</P>
<P>
   Schrade noted that schools do not prescribe medication such as
Ritalin. Any drug prescription has to come from a physician,
although school nurses can administer the drug and school officials
can recommend it.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Carroll started taking Ritalin last year, after he fell
behind in his schoolwork.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers drew up an Individualized Education Plan, a standard
course of action for children with special needs, and they started
giving him speech therapy and extra reading help. He also went to
summer school.
</P>
<P>
   But last fall, when Kyle started second grade, the Ritalin and
extra help didn't seem to do much good. The Carrolls grew concerned
when Kyle was only sleeping about five hours a night and eating
just one meal a day. So they told school officials they wanted to
take Kyle off Ritalin for two weeks to see if that helped.
</P>
<P>
   That's when they got a call, then a visit, from a Child
Protective Services worker.
</P>
<P>
   The visit led to a family court appearance in April, which was
continued to later this month. The hearing will give the Carrolls a
chance to clear their name _ to some extent. If cleared, their case
in the state register of alleged abusers will be sealed, but it
could be opened in the future if there are other allegations of
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Carroll is particularly concerned because she's training to
become a childcare worker. Being in the state register could keep
her from working in that field.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Carrolls still don't know all the details of the
charges against them. The ``intake report'' on their case states
that ``Fa (father) is refusing to give the ch (child) the
Ritalin.''
</P>
<P>
   But several lines on the report are blacked out with a marking
pen. It's roughly analogous to a criminal facing charges but not
being told what they are. Complaints to Child Protective Services
are also anonymous, so suspects don't know who has leveled the
charges. In this case, however, the Carrolls say they were told
that a school guidance counselor made the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Carroll noted this wasn't his first brush with Child
Protective Services. Last year, he said, a social worker checked on
an anonymous rumor that he had gotten drunk and struck family
members, but the allegations turned out to be groundless. No
charges were filed, and the Carrolls were not ``indicated,'' or
written up in the state register like they were for the Ritalin
episode.
</P>
<P>
   Since meeting with the services' workers this year, the Carrolls
have taken their boy to another pediatrician for a second opinion.
The doctor recommended staying with the Ritalin, and the Carrolls
have reluctantly agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in school. He's on the Ritalin. He dislikes school very
much,'' Michael Carroll said.

   UNDATED _ Ballet lovers are drawn to the art form for several
reasons: the extraordinary music; the physical beauty and athletic
grace of the dancers; and, most of all, the dance itself, with all
its imagination, challenge, drama and humor. The best thing about
the ballet in ``Center Stage,'' however, is that it silences the

   UNDATED _ HBO's ``The Corner,'' which ends its five-Sunday run
May 21, was said to be too real and too painful and too depressing
for audiences, and perhaps that's so. Praised by most who have seen
it, the series is unflinching in its depiction of drug users as
everyday folk who simply got caught up in the life and couldn't get
out. It has failed to capture the ``wow'' factor of another HBO
offering, the mob series ``The Sopranos,'' even though its nuance
is just as sharp, its characterizations just as unsettlingly real.

that the Cold War has ended. It would be next to impossible to
convince the American public that there is any reason to put the

humanitarian concern should be sufficient. By CECIL JOHNSON. Story

   NEW ORLEANS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ One of my favorite things about New Orleans is
that it never seems to change. Every time I visit, I know I will
stroll through the French Quarter, eat brunch at Commander's Palace
and a muffuletta at Central Grocery and a Lucky Dog from a pushcart
vendor, and ride the streetcar through the magnolia-lined Garden
District, stopping to wander past the stately mansions. But before
this visit, I'd heard the city was changing so much: There was a
new flashy Harrah's casino. Several big new hotels, including two
oh-so-chic Ws. Hot new restaurants that didn't serve traditional
creole food. A theme park. Two new museums. Was it still going to
feel like New Orleans? By PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ. Story has moved in

   NEW ORLEANS _ It is barely after 9 a.m. as the shuttle-van
driver inches his way down Chartres Street in the French Quarter,
past shuttered boutiques and restaurants where workers are just
starting to sweep out the debris from last night's dinner rush, and
drops me off in front of the 2-month-old W hotel.
</P>
<P>
   There's not much of a sign, just a big red W suspended over the
street, but I know immediately I've arrived at the newest outlet of
the boutique hotel chain.
</P>
<P>
   The sound system is blasting techno music by Moby. In the lobby
_ a tiny, darkened room with velour-covered walls, stark leather
chairs, a stiff gold velour couch, and perpetually drawn
floor-length drapes _ a man wearing black greets me in an accent I
later decide is German. Upstairs, in my room, decorated with
flawless tastefulness in neutral tones and sleek modern lines, the
bedside CD player has been thoughtfully turned on; from the W's
house CD, Grace Jones is growling the retro-chic ``Slave to the
Rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   Is this New Orleans _ or New York?
</P>
<P>
   One of the things I've always loved about New Orleans is that
you know where you are, from the minute you step off your flight;
the city's distinctive architecture, music and food have given it a
sense of place that seems immutable.
</P>
<P>
   Every time I visit, I know I am going to eat bread pudding
souffle at Commander's Palace and a muffuletta dripping with olive
salad at Central Grocery and a Lucky Dog from one of the ubiquitous
streetside pushcart vendors. I will stay at a creaky,
antique-filled hotel in the French Quarter and wander endlessly
through the district's narrow streets, eyeing feathered Mardi Gras
masks and colorful folk paintings. I will listen to live blues at
Tipitina's and ride the St. Charles Avenue streetcar through the
magnolia-lined Garden District, stopping to admire the stately
Southern Gothic mansions and the eerie raised tombs in the old
cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
   But as I planned this late-April trip, everyone wanted to talk
not about old familiar favorites, but new attractions.
</P>
<P>
   There was, most prestigiously, the National D-Day Museum, the
pet project of historian Stephen Ambrose, which has grown to a $23
million, multimedia installation due to open June 6. Within a year,
it will be joined by another new museum, the Ogden Museum of
Southern Art, forming the nucleus of an arts district within
walking distance of the French Quarter. There was the new, vast
Harrah's casino and a soon-to-open theme park called Jazzland, both
trading on sanitized versions of the area's music and food. Plus a
bevy of new hotels, including two Ws and several other stylish
boutique operations, not counting the Ritz-Carlton set to open this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The new hot nightspot? Whiskey Blue, a sleek LA-style lounge
owned by Cindy Crawford's husband. And of the city's 2,000
restaurants, the ones that kept getting mentioned were two new
spots, located outside the tourist-friendly French Quarter, serving
Spanish/Mediterranean and Asian cuisines, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Honestly, I was a little bit worried. Would we still be able to
tell we were in New Orleans?
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Part of New Orleans' appeal is that it has a history like no
other city in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It was settled in 1718 by French colonists on a piece of high
ground overlooking a bend of the Mississippi River; as the city
grew in an arced shape contained by the river, it earned the first
of its many nicknames, the Crescent City. Ruled by the French and
then the Spanish before becoming part of the United States in 1812,
the city developed as a blur of European, African and Southern
influences. It became famous for its spicy creole/Cajun cuisine,
its jazz, its huge collection of pre-1800 buildings and homes, its
voodoo practitioners, and its exuberant Mardi Gras celebrations,
not necessarily in that order.
</P>
<P>
   This rich culture, plus liberal alcohol laws _ the bars never
close, and it is perfectly legal (and somewhat expected) to walk
down Bourbon Street drinking a beer _ have made it a tourist
magnet. More than 11 million people visited in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism has for years been one of the city's largest industries,
and it has expanded rapidly in the past decade. Since 1996, though
6,000 new hotel rooms have been built, bringing the city's total to
about 30,000, occupancy rates have hovered steadily at a healthy 70
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, though New Orleans has long been a city of small
homegrown restaurants, hotels and clubs, or at least of chains
owned by families like the Brennans of Commander's Palace and
Brennan's fame, large national corporations have started to creep
in.
</P>
<P>
   Within the past few years, a House of Blues, a Virgin Records
Megastore, a Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. and a Jimmy Buffett's
Margaritaville have all opened prominent locations in the French
Quarter. Hotel chains like the Marriott and the W have taken over
and renovated many older buildings. The Harrah's casino, open since
October '99, took up an entire city block at the end of Canal
Street, with its immense gaming halls containing 3,000 slot
machines and 120 tables for games like poker and roulette; it is
estimated that each man, woman and child landing at the airport
must spend more than $60 at the casino for it to break even.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Clinton lights into possible successor
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton, in his most pointed attack yet against the
Republican who could follow him in the White House, said that
George W. Bush, if elected, would let polluters control the
nation's environmental policy and appoint Supreme Court justices
who would outlaw abortion. Clinton leveled his criticism in an
interview with Diane Rehm on WAMU-FM in Washington. Moreover,
Clinton said, Bush would press for big tax cuts and higher Pentagon
spending that would bring back budget deficits and higher interest
rates. ``It will mean that we won't have much money left over to
invest in education or the environment or health care,'' he said.
Clinton noted that Bush opposed the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban
Treaty _ defeated by the Senate last year _ and said Bush ``wants
to build a much bigger missile defense system than the evidence
warrants.'' He suggested Bush's positions could affect efforts to
reduce nuclear stockpiles around the world. ``So I think that gives
me some pause,'' he said. ``I think that's troublesome.''
</P>
<P>
   A FINE STATE OF AFFAIRS
</P>
<P>
   With Rudy Giuliani and his wife discussing separation, his
health in jeopardy and an extra-marital relationship exposed, even
he himself seems uncertain as to whether he will continue his
Senate bid against Hillary Clinton. ``I'm not thinking about
politics right now,'' he said at a news conference. ``I'm thinking
about my family, the people that I love. ... Politics comes at
least second, maybe third, maybe fourth, somewhere else at least.''
He added: ``It will all work itself out some way politically.''
Giuliani had just announced that he and Donna Hanover, after years
of speculation about the state of their marriage, were splitting
up. The Associated Press quoted an unnamed Republican official who
is a strong Giuliani supporter as saying the mayor was leaning
toward getting out of the race: ``His heart, his soul, his body are
not in this thing.'' But the official cautioned that Giuliani
hadn't made a final decision.
</P>
<P>
   KEY SWING VOTERS LEANING BUSH'S WAY . . .
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is tied with Al Gore among women and leads among
conservative Democrats who supported Ronald Reagan, says a new
Voter.com-Battleground poll released today. It suggests that voters
are growing increasingly pessimistic about the state of the nation_
a bad sign for Democrats. ``All the indications are that Bush has
an edge in the race and that Gore is the underdog, which is
unbelievable given the strong economy and what Bush went through in
the primaries,'' said political analyst Stuart Rothenberg.
Nationally, Bush led Gore 48-42 percent in the bipartisan survey by
Democratic pollster Celinda Lake and Republican pollster Ed Goeas.
It had a 3 percentage point error margin. A national survey
released a day earlier by the Los Angeles Times showed Bush leading
51-43 percent among registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   . . . AND GORE GETS SOME FEMALE ADVICE
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has been put on notice by two dozen women's
organizations that he needs to work harder to win women's political
allegiance. In an hourlong session at the Old Executive Office
Building next to the White House with about 40 leaders of the
women's groups, Gore was told he needed a better media strategy to
convey his positions on issues like Social Security, paycheck
fairness, domestic violence and abortion. ``The message isn't
getting out to women,'' Kim Gandy, executive V.P. of the National
Organization for Women, said after the meeting. Nancy Zirkin of the
American Association of University Women said the meeting was
requested four months ago, on a nonpartisan basis, so the women
could hold a general discussion with Gore about their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   MARCHING TO THE VETERANS' BEAT
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore courted veterans with $1.2 billion in new education
money for them, their families and their survivors. ``Those who
fight for our security should never have to fight for the education
they need to succeed,'' he told about 150 veterans at a VFW post in
Jacksonville, Fla. If Congress agrees, monthly federal payments to
veterans and their families would be increased by 25 percent, from
$536 to $670 next year. Benefits also would be indexed to
inflation, and veterans could use the money for other types of
learning, such as high-tech training, during school breaks. Gore
said no new money would be needed to pay for the increased benefits
since they will be covered by money available from the Department
of Veterans Affairs. George W. Bush's campaign criticized the
proposal as ``a day late'' and ``millions of dollars short.''
</P>
<P>
   TALK LIKE THE HARVARD GUYS?
</P>
<P>
   Linguists rejoice. There's hope yet for George W. Bush, who when
at a loss for a word to describe Israel once labeled the important
U.S. ally a ``buddy.'' Bush joked this week that he had ordered a
batch of ``Verbal Advantage'' vocabulary tapes, which promise users
``a Harvard graduate's vocabulary in just 15 minutes a day.'' Bush
has joked that he has no chance in November because Al Gore
graduated from Harvard. While Bush got his graduate business degree
from Harvard; his undergraduate degree is from Yale.
</P>
<P>
   BOSNIAK _ THAT MUST BE HARVARD-SPEAK
</P>
<P>
   Although aides to George W. Bush dismiss as unimportant the
several times he has mangled the proper terms for people of various
nationalities, they were elated by a report that Al Gore had
committed a similar error. Karen Hughes, Bush's communications
director, gleefully broadcast the bulletin that Gore had referred
to Bosnians as Bosniaks. ``It can happen to the best of us,''
Hughes said, ``as I hope the vice president will concede.'' Yes,
but The New York Times pointed out that Bosniak apparently is an
acceptable alternative, listed in some dictionaries.
</P>
<P>
   CORZINE'S STOCK RISES FAST
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street millionaire Jon Corzine, making his first bid for
public office with a run for the Senate in New Jersey, has eclipsed
ex-Gov. Jim Florio in their race for the Democratic nomination. A
new Quinnipiac College poll shows Corzine leading 48-33 percent
with less than a month until the primary. The margin of error was
5.3 percentage points. In March, Florio led Corzine by nearly a 2-1
margin. Six months ago, Corzine, who stepped down as co-chairman of
the Goldman Sachs investment firm last year, had only single-digit
support. A debate in Trenton tonight will be the first in a series
between the two, who're seeking the seat of retiring Democrat Frank
Lautenberg.

country, a brash newcomer to Washington who moonlighted as
Georgetown's most notorious pubcrawler. Today, former President
Carter's chief-of-staff has no power than any other Little League
assistant coach. Between one life and another, he went through a
divorce, has survived cancer three times, run for the U.S. Senate
and lost, and gone from a thirtyish Beltway climber to a sedate
middle-aged father of three young children. In his book ``No Such

&HT;     POLL SHOWS BUSH GAINING IN DEMOCRATIC VOTING BLOCS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican George W. Bush is making dramatic
inroads into traditional Democratic constituencies to lead Democrat
Al Gore 48 percent to 42 percent in the presidential race,
according to a bipartisan survey released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Voter.com-Battleground 2000 survey conducted by Democratic
pollster Celinda Lake and Republican pollster Ed Goeas showed that
voter anxiety over moral values and the direction of the nation _
rather than proposed solutions for specific problems _ is helping
Bush garner support among once-loyal Democratic voting blocs.
</P>
<P>
   Anniversaries of the shootings at Columbine High School and the
Oklahoma City bombing, coupled with fresh episodes of mass killings
and tremors in the stock markets have stirred voters' concerns
about the future of their nation, Lake and Goeas reported.
</P>
<P>
   The scandals that afflicted President Clinton during his
presidency continue to shape attitudes as well, with 62 percent of
those surveyed expressing disapproval of Clinton ``as a person'' at
the same time that 57 percent express approval of his handling of
his job as president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has stormed back from a 4 percentage-point deficit among
women voters in March to seize a 3 percentage-point edge over Gore
among women _ thanks to a whopping 12 percentage point edge among
white women. Bush now leads Gore among all; women, 47 percent to 44
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush even enjoys a 14 percentage-point advantage over Gore among
conservative Democrats who voted for Ronald Reagan in the 1980s but
returned to the Democratic fold to help elect President Clinton to
two terms. Bush now leads among the key swing bloc, 55 percent to
41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also has gained against Gore among union households,
slashing Gore's 11 percentage point edge in March to just 2
percentage points in the latest survey.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also is scoring gains in the Midwest where both Lake and
Goeas predict the 2000 presidential campaign will be decided. Bush
leads Gore 45 percent to 40 percent in Midwestern states.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has scored the gains thanks to his adoption of an
``umbrella theme'' that emphasizes ``compassionate conservatism,''
steps to overhaul the education system and plans to end partisan
rancor, said Goeas, president of the Tarrance Group, a polling firm
that is polling for five Republican governors, 16 Republican
senators and more than 40 GOP House members.
</P>
<P>
   The joint Republican-Democratic survey was conducted nationwide
by telephone from May 1 to May 3 _ six months before the election _
to reach 1,000 likely voters. The margin of error is 3.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The survey assessed voter sentiment nationwide. The U.S.
Constitution calls for presidential elections to be decided by
candidates' accumulation of electoral votes in state-by-state
contests rather than a single nationwide popularity contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big story is that the gender gap has been neutralized by
George W. Bush without losing the intensity with men,'' Goeas said.
</P>
<P>
   Lake said Bush's post-primary campaign is boosting his support
among women by neutralizing the long-standing advantage that
Democratic candidates enjoy from proposals to solve specific
``kitchen table'' issues such as health-care reform, protecting the
solvency of Social Security and expanding the reach of Medicare for
elderly Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key dynamic to this election is whether Democrats can
break through the values' barrier and talk about issues in a
values-oriented way to maximize their advantage on the issues,''
said Lake, a pollster for the 1992 Clinton campaign who now serves
as president of Lake Snell Perry &AMP; Associates, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats ``have to be worried about'' Republican success
hijacking the venerable Democratic issue of education reform, Lake
said, noting that Democrats' 20 percentage-point advantage on the
issue in 1998 has been cut to a 7 percentage-point edge now.
</P>
<P>
   Lake declared: ``Democrats clearly need a big fight on education
to clarify where the Republicans are on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has suffered other setbacks, including diminution of
support among African American women since voters were energized by
the Democratic presidential primaries. The survey found that 53
percent of African-American women said they believed the country
was on the ``wrong track'' _ sentiment that could reduce turnout
for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters' ambivalence and increasingly pessimistic outlook could
spell trouble for Democrats as November grows closer,'' Lake
warned. ``Democrats need to mobilize their constituencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Support for Gore among working women in general and retired
women in particular has ebbed since March, Lake said. Bush has
reaped an 18 percentage-point gain since March among white senior
women, aged over 65, to hold a 9-percentage point advantage over
Gore, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   Lake and Goeas said that Gore could face additional challenges
carrying Democratic-leaning states such as California, Oregon,
Washington and New Mexico due to third-party challenges from the
Reform Party's Pat Buchanan and the Green Party's Ralph Nader.
Those two candidates each drew 3 percent of the vote in the latest
survey, but if that swells to 5 percent or more, their candidacies
could hurt Gore in key Democratic states, Lake and Goeas said.
</P>
<P>
   In a hypothetical four-way race nationwide, Bush leads Gore 45
percent to 39 percent, with Buchanan and Nader drawing 3 percent
each. Buchanan and Nader have not yet completed arrangements to
appear on the November ballot in all 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   The single biggest boost Gore gets from the survey is evidence
that he is rebounding among Hispanic voters, a traditionally
Democratic voting bloc with the exception of GOP-leaning
Cuban-Americans in Florida. Gore has recovered from Bush's initial
9 percentage-point edge among Hispanics to lead Bush by 12
personage-points in the latest survey.

`JESUS': DEVOUT, WISE AND LOVES TO DANCE AT WEDDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Broadcast notes appear at end of review. Time, channel are

 By ANITA GATES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Jesus'' begins with bad dreams. The son of Mary and
Joseph, 30 years old and still holding back from setting out on his
real mission in life, has nightmares about the future: wars,
crusades and immolations that will be carried out in his name. So
really _ as Satan suggests to him later in the wilderness _ what's
the point of even preaching the word if that's what it's all going
to come to?
</P>
<P>
   CBS' new two-part movie about the life of Jesus is intriguing
and strikingly original, a portrait of the clash between politics
and spirituality, a mix of biblical tradition and insistent
humanizing. There is a special pleasure in hearing Jesus (Jeremy
Sisto) use the ``it's not you, it's me'' argument with a young
woman who is in love with him (Mary of Bethany, sister of Martha
and Lazarus, played with great charm by Stefania Rocca). After he
tells dd feather he has to go his own way, without her, he tries to
explain: ``My life is not my own'' and ``It is not you.''
</P>
<P>
   Making the figure of Jesus more human seems to have been the
goal of lots of writers and filmmakers in recent years, from the
original stage production of ``Jesus Christ Superstar'' three
decades ago to Martin Scorsese's 1988 adaptation of Nikos
Kazantzakis' ``Last Temptation of Christ'' to NBC's pallid ``Mary,
Mother of Jesus'' last fall (in which Christian Bale tried to
overcome the bad film around him but couldn't). ``Jesus'' seems to
have succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   This Jesus is full of life and playfulness. He loves to dance at
weddings and in the street. He enjoys wine and a good meal, tells
stories over dinner and often nibbles on something while he's
dispensing wisdom. One day he starts a water fight with his
disciples at a well. He actually smiles during the Sermon on the
Mount. Under the direction of Roger Young, who has previously made
television films on Moses and Joseph, Sisto seems completely at
ease: confident, strong and sometimes a little bossy. So when he
has moments of doubt (great doubt), they are all the more powerful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus'' makes multiple points with one incident, as good drama
should. Near the beginning of the film, while Joseph and Jesus are
on their way home from a carpentry job, the tax collector (employed
by the Roman Empire) comes to their house. To Mary's horror, he
takes away their goat as payment for what she is told are back
taxes. That night at dinner, Joseph is outraged. ``When, when will
there be an end to the suffering of our people?'' he says, looking
directly at his grown son. Jesus answers, calmly but pointedly:
``Are you asking me? Or are you telling me that I can end the
suffering?''
</P>
<P>
   Credit has to go to the efficient, graceful script by Suzette
Couture, who has previously written television films about far
different subjects, including the Dionne quintuplets and the
Tailhook scandal. Couture gives Jesus a believable home life, but
with its own quirks. The Annunciation, for instance, is an old
story that the family retells and laughs about. ``I think he
thought I was crazy,'' Mary (Jacqueline Bisset, looking radiant and
constantly proud) tells Jesus. Smiling, she recalls in a quick
flashback the day she had to tell her fiance that an angel had
appeared to her and informed her that even though she was a virgin
she was pregnant. Jesus gets a good laugh out of this, as always.
</P>
<P>
   After Joseph's death, Jesus decides the time has come for him to
leave home. Then, in short succession, come the water-into-wine
miracle (it was his cousin Benjamin's wedding), Jesus' baptism, the
cleansing of the temple, the Sermon on the Mount, the official
choice of his apostles (which feels like the announcement of the
Miss America finalists, but in a good way), the walking-on-water
miracle and the raising of Lazarus from the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Near the beginning of all this, Jesus undergoes the temptation
in the wilderness, so that he can know how it feels to be ``as
fragile, alone and little'' as humans. Satan (Jeroen Krabbe in a
black suit, although he sometimes morphs into a beautiful woman in
a red dress) greets him: ``You don't look so good, Jesus. Are you
hungry?'' Jesus is starving and sunburned, with sand in his
eyebrows. Satan's virtual-reality tour of the world doesn't make
him feel better, and things are only going to get worse.
</P>
<P>
   Politics and power are major elements of ``Jesus.'' Pontius
Pilate (Gary Oldman) is a tough cookie from the day he begins his
new job as governor of Judea (``the most troublesome province in
the empire''). When Herod Antipas (Luca Barbareschi) tries to
impress him by describing himself as a personal friend of the Roman
emperor Tiberius, Pilate replies coolly: ``Strange. I've never
heard him mention you.''
</P>
<P>
   The actions of Judas (Thomas Lockyer) are political, too. As
Jesus enters Jerusalem on that first Palm Sunday, Judas' friends
ask, ``When will Jesus call for revolution?'' Soon, Judas says.
When he learns that isn't the case, he abandons ship.
</P>
<P>
   John the Baptist (David O'Hara) strikes a contemporary note
when, preaching at the River Jordan, he reminds his followers,
``Our leaders are weak and sinful.'' The script also lets John
explain ritual in terms that fit with 21st-century consciousness.
Baptism, symbolic of washing away the lies, he explains,
``signifies that your commitment has already been made.''
</P>
<P>
   The film has flaws. At times there is an awkwardness to the
sentiment, and some reaction shots ring false (including Bisset's
during her son's arrest and crucifixion). But overall the cast is
in fine form. Armin Mueller-Stahl is a warm but volatile Joseph.
Debra Messing, much quieter than her comic ``Will and Grace''
character, makes a sympathetic Mary Magdalene. Patrick Williams'
score goes a long way toward setting the film's tone, even if it
does get a little overtriumphant in the Ascension scene.
</P>
<P>
   The only people ``Jesus'' could possibly offend are those whose
interpretation of Christianity looks upon any enjoyment of the
physical senses as a little bit sinful. For the rest of us, the
film is proof that every story, no matter how familiar, can be made
new. When Jesus leans over to his newly named disciple on his
fishing boat and whispers: ``Come with me, Peter. I'll make you a
fisher of men,'' the line has an urgency and a soul-stirring
excitement that I somehow missed in Sunday school. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Rockefeller Center is famous for the 100-foot
Christmas tree it installs every year. Now, over the next few
weeks, another large but definitely cuter silhouette will take its
place: a 43-foot terrier puppy made of flowers will go up in front
of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, in the same spot where the tree stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Puppy,'' by Jeff Koons, the 1980s art star, was created in
1992 for a temporary exhibition in Arolsen, a small town about 40
minutes by car from Kassel, Germany, where it stood in the center
of a courtyard of a Baroque palace. It was shown in Sydney in 1996,
and an identical puppy (with different flowers suitable to its
climate and location) stands in front of the Guggenheim Bilbao in
Spain as part of the permanent collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Puppy'' has never been seen in New York until now. The
installation, _ a three-week process that involves about 100
people, ranging from riggers to planters and engineers, all
directed by Koons _ begins early next week. ``Puppy'' will be on
view through Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to look for ways to enhance the public space at
Rockefeller Center,'' said Jerry Speyer, president of Tishman
Speyer Properties, which is co-owner and manager of Rockefeller
Center. ``It's a great work of art, and I thought it would be
wonderful to show it here.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year Rockefeller Center presented an outdoor exhibition of
Rodin sculptures. It has also had a car show and a flower show.
``This is a different kind of flower show,'' said Speyer, adding
that he expected about three million visitors to view ``Puppy.''
</P>
<P>
   Putting the sculpture together is no easy task. Rockefeller
Center asked the Public Art Fund, a nonprofit group that puts
together exhibitions around the city, to organize the project.
``Puppy'' had to travel by ship and train from Sydney, a journey
that took about a month and a half.
</P>
<P>
   The installation is so complex because the work is formed from a
series of stainless-steel armatures built to hold more than 25 tons
of soil. An internal irrigation system waters more than 70,000
flowering plants, including marigolds, begonias, impatiens,
petunias and lobelias from different nurseries on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is one of the great sculptures of our time,''
said Susan K. Freedman, president of the Public Art Fund.
``Rockefeller Center is the perfect backdrop to show it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mass MOCA Boom
</P>
<P>
   When the $37 million Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art,
known simply as Mass MOCA, opened about a year ago on a 13-acre
campus in the depressed town of North Adams, Mass., in the
northwest corner of the state, it was understood that the project
would create about 100 new jobs and attract scores of visitors to a
blue-collar town that had always been overshadowed by neighboring
Williamstown. But a year after its opening, the boom created by the
arts center has far exceeded expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is certainly an example of how a cultural institution can
lead the charge,'' said Joseph C. Thompson, director of the museum.
Besides attracting more than 100,000 visitors, the
interdisciplinary art center has created more than 200 jobs, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   When Mass MOCA opened, the site, once the home of Sprague
Electric Co., was so large that the institution could develop
20,000 square feet of office space, which it has rented. It has
added 15,000 more square feet of office space over the last year.
Because its tenants, primarily fast-growing technology companies,
are attracting like-minded businesses to the Berkshires, it is
renovating an additional 34,000 square feet, all of which has
already been leased. Rents have more than doubled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Berkshire County has become a hotbed for e-commerce,''
Thompson said. ``It's known as Silicon Village.'' One attraction,
he said, is that these office spaces were purposely outfitted with
what he described as ``plug and ready'' equipment to attract
e-commerce companies. Downtown has benefited from Mass MOCA's
presence, too. The business district had a 70 percent vacancy rate
before the museum opened; now, the rate is 30 percent, Thompson
said. Developers plan to take some of the land adjacent to the
museum and erect more offices and a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   All the tenants on the museum's campus are helping to raise
revenues, which are channeled back into the arts complex. That is
the difference between Mass MOCA and other cultural institutions
that have helped economically depressed areas, like the Guggenheim
Bilbao, which has given a boost to the Basque region of Spain, or
Dia Center for the Arts in Manhattan, which has contributed to the
boom in Chelsea. ``The difference is that we benefit directly from
our real estate,'' Thompson said. ``It's our endowment.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Smith Estate
</P>
<P>
   Tony Smith died 20 years ago, but his estate still holds a
significant body of his work. Smith, best known for his huge black
modular sculptures, began to exhibit these works in the mid-1960s,
when he was 48. Before that, he was both an architect and a
painter.
</P>
<P>
   For years Paula Cooper represented his estate, but it will now
be handled by Matthew Marks, the Chelsea dealer, and Lucy
Mitchell-Innes, whose gallery, Mitchell-Innes &AMP; Nash, is on the
Upper East Side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jane Smith felt it was time for a change,'' said John
Silberman, the estate's lawyer, speaking for the artist's widow.
Marks and Mitchell-Innes also represent the de Kooning estate,
which he handles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering he was not a prolific artist and died relatively
young, the estate is surprisingly rich in top-quality work,'' Marks
said of Smith. He organized a show of the artist's drawings five
years ago. ``There are lots of wonderful paintings, some dating
from the 1930s, and a surprising number of sculptures, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Both galleries plan to organize shows over the next two years. &QL;

ISRAELI HIGH COURT BARS PAROLE FOR SETTLER CONVICTED OF KILLING
ARAB 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Supreme Court on Thursday overturned a decision
to parole a Jewish settler who had initially been sentenced to life
imprisonment for the execution-style killing of a Palestinian.
</P>
<P>
   The settler, Yoram Skolnik, 31, was granted parole in March on
the ground that he did not pose a danger to the public. His
sentence had been twice commuted, first to 15 years by President
Ezer Weizman, then to 11 years by a former justice minister, Tzahi
Hanegbi.
</P>
<P>
   Skolnik was to have been freed last month, but his release was
held up by a petition to the Supreme Court by Zehava Galon, a
legislator from the leftist Meretz Party.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling on the petition Thursday, a seven-judge panel headed by
the chief justice, Aharon Barak, said the parole board had acted
unreasonably by failing to give appropriate weight to the danger
posed by Skolnik, who the judges said had acted out of ``profound
hatred'' stemming from a dangerous ``nationalistic ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   The judges ruled that Skolnik should serve out the remaining
four years of his term.
</P>
<P>
   On March 23, 1993, Sknolnik killed Musah Abu Sabha, a
Palestinian who had been caught near Susia, a settlement south of
Hebron in the West Bank, carrying a knife and grenade. Abu Sabha
was subdued after trying to stab a settler, and as he lay face down
with his hands bound behind him, Sknolnik shot him nine times with
an Uzi submachine gun.
</P>
<P>
   Galon, the petitioner, said after Thursday's ruling that the
decision to parole Skolnik had been ``morally tainted.''

<P>
   ``The Supreme Court is essentially saying that a murderer cannot
go free after seven years,'' she said. ``The price for murdering an
Arab is not seven years,'' she added; such a short term ``is
unacceptable in Israeli society.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians sentenced to life terms for killing Israelis have
not had their sentences commuted, nor have they been eligible for
parole. But as part of interim accords with the Palestinians,
Israel has released scores of prisoners convicted of killing fellow
Arabs whom they suspected of being informers for the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to those releases, Fred Skolnik, Skolnik's father, said
after Thursday's ruling, ``There are murderers who have served
less: terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   Benny Elon, a legislator from the extreme rightist Moledet
Party, accused the judges of favoring Galon's views. ``When she
petitions the Supreme Court, she's coming home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar case, the district court in Tel Aviv sentenced a
settler, Gur Hamel, 28, to life imprisonment for killing an elderly
Palestinian in an olive grove near the West Bank settlement of
Itamar in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Hamel attacked the Palestinian, Ahmed Hatatbeh, 68, as he was
harvesting olives near Beit Furik, a Palestinian village,
strangling him and then crushing his head with a rock. Hamel
originally claimed that he had acted in self-defense. The judge
rejected arguments by Hamel's lawyer that he was emotionally
disturbed.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Secessionist rebels mounted a major attack outside
Chechnya's borders for the first time in nearly nine months
Thursday, all but wiping out a convoy of 22 Russian soldiers as it
moved down a mountain road in Ingushetia, a Russian region
bordering Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The mid-morning ambush of two troop trucks and an armored
vehicle in the foothills of the Caucasus Mountains killed 18
Russian Interior Ministry troops and wounded three others. One
soldier was reported missing.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said the servicemen had finished a tour of
duty in Ingushetia and were preparing to head home when the attack
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were attacked treacherously with grenade launchers by
bandits who hd in the roadside bush,'' the first deputy chief of
the Russian general staff, Col. Gen. Valery Manilov, said. ``We
hope that we will track them down and punish them for their
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian planes later bombed forests near the ambush site, north
of the village of Khalashki and just a few miles from the major
government-run camps for Chechen war refugees. It was not known
whether the attackers were hit.
</P>
<P>
   With Thursday's deaths, Manilov said, 2,251 Russian servicemen
have died in the Chechen conflict, a figure some outside experts
contend is well below the true number.
</P>
<P>
   The ambush was a departure for the battered rebels, who had not
attacked Russian troops outside Chechnya's borders since the early
stages of the Chechen war in September. The war began last summer
after rebels invaded the neighboring province of Dagestan, touching
off a struggle with Russian troops along the border of the two
provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel leaders threatened on Tuesday to carry their war for
Chechen independence into nearby provinces unless Russian troops
withdraw from Chechnya by the end of May.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels' website, www.kavkaz.org, quoted the guerrilla
commander Shamil Basayev as saying that the rebels would ``declare
jihad across the whole of the Caucasus, everywhere the Russian
aggressors are.''
</P>
<P>
   The main Russian spokesman on the conflict, Sergei
Yastrzhembsky, dismissed the threat as ``mere bravado not backed by
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear if the rebels, backed into southern Chechnya's
mountains by the Russians, could widen the conflict beyond periodic
ambushes like the one Thursday. The Russian military says many
guerrillas have melted into the civilian populations of Chechnya
and Ingushetia.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, ambushes like Thursday's make it clear that
Russian forces have not restored order to the area, as spokesmen
are now claiming. The rebels have staged damaging attacks on
Russian convoys on the average of every two weeks since general
fighting ended in March, killing as many as 32 soldiers in a single
ambush.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military says it has killed about 100 rebels this
month alone.
</P>
<P>
   Manilov argued Thursday that ``despite all the difficulties and
complexities, life is returning to normal'' in Chechnya. He said
296 of the 353 schools had reopened; 37 of 60 hospitals were in
operation; and some 2,500 rebels had taken up an amnesty offer,
extended to May 15, and laid down their arms.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The subsiding of open war appears to have won over the Council
of Europe, a 41-member group that threatened to suspend Russia's
membership over human-rights violations in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The group dropped the threat Thursday at a meeting in
Strasbourg, France, after Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov argued that
Russia has established its own agency to investigate allegations of
crimes and human-rights abuses by its troops.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The council repeated its demand that Russia open talks with
Chechen representatives on a political settlement, but Manlilov and
Yastrzhembsky re-stated Thursday that that is not an option.
</P>
<P>
   The prospects for a political dialogue briefly brightened this
week after it was disclosed that the head of an independent Russian
commission looking into wartime abuses, the Russian legislator
Pavel Krasheninnikov, had met in Ingushetia with a top
representative of Chechnya's president, Aslan Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
   Krasheninnikov apparently traveled to the meeting under the
protection of Russian troops, lending the air of an official
endorsement to the session.
</P>
<P>
   But Manilov on Thursday repeated the official line on talks,
saying that the notion of negotiations with Maskhadov is
``nonsense.''

A FIRST-RELEASE DIRECTOR MEETS A BIG BOY 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Tom Dey thought the preview screening of ``Shanghai
Noon,'' his first effort as a feature film director, was going
pretty well, but he was unprepared for the phone call from Disney
distribution executives. ``They said they were so excited about it
that they wanted to make it their big Memorial Day release,'' Dey
said. ``Never did I imagine anything like that. We were just a
relatively small production shooting in Calgary. We were never
considered a summer heavyweight. It was a dream come true.''
</P>
<P>
   But now Dey and his comical western, starring Jackie Chan and
Owen Wilson, is up against Tom Cruise and ``Mission: Impossible
2,'' the only two national releases on the summer's premier movie
weekend. Cruise opens on May 24, Chan two days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to work this angle: We're the underdogs, feel sorry
for us,'' Dey said.
</P>
<P>
   The summer movie season is already here. ``Gladiator'' opened to
$34 million last weekend. John Travolta's ``Battlefield Earth''
opens on Friday, Disney's computer-animated ``Dinosaur'' on May 19.
Then comes Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   The films considered likeliest to be box-office champions _
which include ``The Patriot'' with Mel Gibson, ``The Perfect
Storm'' with George Clooney and ``Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps''
with Eddie Murphy _ will roll out with weekly predictability
through Labor Day weekend. But which films, if any, will emerge as
the summer's sleepers? Some think ``Shanghai Noon'' is a contender.
</P>
<P>
   The film is a gentle-hearted western about a Chinese Imperial
Guard ( Chan) who comes to America in the 1880s to rescue a
kidnapped princess (Lucy Liu) and hooks up with a hapless train
robber ( Wilson).
</P>
<P>
   Dey, working his way through a slice of gooseberry pie at the
Farmer's Market this week, said he had not really wanted to make
the film when he walked into a meeting with executives at Spyglass
Entertainment, which produced the film (as it did last summer's
``Sixth Sense'') with Disney. ``But there I was, in the room with
them, and I suddenly started pitching and talking about how I'd
make the film, and they said they really liked what they heard,''
Dey recalled. ``I thought, `Oh, what have I done?'''
</P>
<P>
   He flew to Hong Kong to meet with Chan, star of the 1998 sleeper
hit ``Rush Hour,'' and then to Beijing, where some of the opening
scenes were eventually shot in the Forbidden City, after much
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, after studying at the American Film Institute, Dey
had been making television commercials at Ridley Scott Associates.
</P>
<P>
   After ``Shanghai Noon'' opens, though, he plans to take some
time off before tackling another project. ``I don't know if I have
a directorial style,'' he said. ``I mean, this is just my first
movie. But I think that, basically, I'd rather be felt than
heard.''
</P>
<P>
   That is to say, he would rather go for the emotion in a scene
than go for the funny line. He learned something else, too, he
said. Not until ``Shanghai Noon'' was well into shooting did he
realize what it was really about: the friendship between Chan's and
Wilson's characters. ``It's not about an Imperial Guard coming to
America to rescue a princess,'' he said. ``It's about friendship.
It's about a very simple thing. That's maybe the most important
thing this movie taught me. I learned how to look into a script and
find that simple thing.''
</P>
<P>
   TRACEY LOVES WOODY
</P>
<P>
   Tracey Ullman's office, from which she plots her career and runs
her critically acclaimed HBO comedy series, is on a residential
side street in central Santa Monica, within exhaust reach of the
freeway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a call from Woody Allen saying he had a new script and
wanted me to play a part in it,'' Ullman said. ``I asked if I could
see the script, and they had someone bring it over. The man sat out
there on the sofa while I sat in here and read it. It was a
wonderful part. Could I keep the script? I called up and asked. And
they said yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen has been known to refuse to allow his actors to see, much
less keep, an entire script, so Ullman was happily surprised. It
was necessary, though, because of the size of her part. In ``Small
Time Crooks,'' the first film Allen will release through
DreamWorks, Allen plays a hapless hoodlum who has a loving but
bombastic relationship with his long-suffering wife, played by
Ullman. Opening on May 19, it co-stars Hugh Grant, Michael Rapaport
and Elaine May.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see Woody in the movie?'' she asked. ``I thought he
looked so cute in his stone-washed denim shorts. It was great
seeing him play somebody again who wasn't rich and sophisticated.''
</P>
<P>
   Ullman said that Allen always knew what he wanted in a scene but
that he was also willing to let some of the actors try lines or
movements or wardrobe of their own. Grant, who plays an
uncharacteristically unsympathetic role, was able to ad-lib a
revealingly acid twist on his exit line in one scene, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All in all,'' she said. ``I would be happy if I were to do
nothing for the rest of my life but my television series and Woody
Allen movies.''
</P>
<P>
   A MODERN CLAUDIUS
</P>
<P>
   Claudius is normally played by an actor appreciably older than
the one playing Hamlet. ``I thought that they had the name of the
part wrong when they called to ask me to play the role,'' said Kyle
MacLachlan, who appears opposite Ethan Hawke's Danish prince in
Michael Almereyda's modern-day translation of the Shakespeare
tragedy, opening on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It had been many years since MacLachlan had played Shakespeare.
Before landing his career-starting role in the lead of David
Lynch's ``Dune,'' he had studied and performed Shakespeare in
regional theater, playing Romeo twice, the boy in ``Henry V'' and
Octavius in ``Julius Caesar.'' Between ``Dune'' and now, no
Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   MacLachlan said he was particularly taken with Almereyda's
decision to pitch the tragedy in a very naturalistic, American
style of acting and speaking. ``I've always maintained that the
best way to speak Shakespeare is to make it as accessible as
possible,'' he said. ``If that means you ruin the structure of the
poetry, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   He can also be seen in Mike Figgis' experimental ``Time Code,''
and will be spending the next few months in New York filming a role
_ as the first substantial romantic interest for Charlotte (Kristin
Davis) _ in ``Sex and the City'' on HBO. At the same time, he said,
he hopes to renew his contacts with the New York theater world and
possibly land a stage role. ``I'd love for it to be Shakespeare,''
he said. &QL;

&HT;     MEDICINE BALLS MAKE A COMEBACK IN GYMS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KRISTI L. GUSTAFSON   
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Walk into your local gym and you're guaranteed to
see many frightening (and often unidentifiable) pieces of workout
equipment. But now adult fitness centers are looking a little like
a children's gymboree, with knee-high white, red and blue balls
rolling around the room. Although you may be tempted to toss a
ball, or even bounce on it since it resembles the popular pogo
ball, they're meant to be used to improve fitness.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Ryan, group fitness director at an area Gold's Gym has been
incorporating the rubbery fitness balls into her strength-training
classes for four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball helps to both strengthen and tone because you're
working a whole new group of muscles just by trying to maintain
your balance,'' Ryan said. ``It can become a full-body workout.''
</P>
<P>
   What is now the latest fitness craze originated in Europe as a
physical therapy tool nearly 50 years ago and was introduced to the
United States in the 1960s. Columbia Physical Therapy in East
Greenbush, N.Y., has used the balls for the past four years to help
treat neurological disorders, orthopedic problems and back pain,
according to therapist Denise Conklin.
</P>
<P>
   She has found them particularly useful with older adults,
particularly in helping them regain balance. They start by
maintaining their balance sitting on the ball, as if it were a
chair and move on to leg and arm lifts (while sitting) as balance
improves.
</P>
<P>
   The ball as a fitness tool is nothing new. They were originally
called medicine balls or Swiss balls (because of their European
origin). Now you'll find a wide variety manufactured by fitness
companies, such as FitBall and Resist-A-Ball, and sold online and
in sports stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw them at all the fitness conferences and decided to try
them with our clients,'' said Randy Jurus, a fitness manager at an
area gym. ``They were popular almost immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   As a personal trainer, Jurus uses the fitness balls with the
majority of her clients.
</P>
<P>
   Jurus often has clients stretch their upper body by lying over
the ball and using it as a guide to reach out farther than they
normally would.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball acts as a guide and usually helps people to me more
effective with their stretches,'' Jurus said. ``They'll stretch
further and push themselves more.''
</P>
<P>
   When incorporated into a fitness class or training session the
ball can act as a replacement for a workout bench, the wall or even
the floor, adding variety and difficulty to the exercises.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're perfect for the beginner to the professional athlete,
especially skiers and golfers,'' Ryan said. ``And age is not a
factor. We have children, teens, adults and seniors all using the
ball for different workouts.''
</P>
<P>
   Skiers often loosen up and practice the twisting motion and
movements they use on the slopes with the help of the fitness
balls. Skiers are able to strengthen the hip and leg muscles used
on the slopes by doing squats with the ball between their backs and
the wall. Twisting with the 3.14-pound ball in hand strengthens
oblique muscles which are important for core strength, a
fundamental concern of skiers, according to Kathleen Lessman,
former editor of Freeze magazine, a skiing publication, in order to
ease muscle strain.
</P>
<P>
   Strength training often involves using the ball for support
while maintaining your balance throughout various exercises.
</P>
<P>
   ``People often have a difficult time keeping their balance while
lifting a leg or their arms, which is often done when strength
training with the ball,'' Ryan said. ``It takes time to develop the
coordination and balance necessary for the fitness ball to truly be
effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan will use the fitness balls for part of a class.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball helps to vary the routine and it keeps it
interesting,'' said Dr. Lisa Silverberg, 48, who takes Ryan's
classes throughout the week. ``It keeps it challenging and exciting
and I'm motivated to keep up with Kate (Ryan).''
</P>
<P>
   The American Council on Exercise tests each fitness fad to hit
the gym floors and strongly recommends fitness balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the few new exercise tools that is not gimmicky,''
said Mark Anders of the council. ``People show significant
improvement in both strength and muscle mass once they begin using
the ball on a regular basis.''
</P>
<P>
   The inflatable balls are made of thick, durable PVC foam and are
among the less expensive pieces of equipment used to tighten and
tone. For about $20 to $50 each, it is a much cheaper alternative
to the large and costly exercise machines that often become dust
gatherers.

&HT;     JUDGES ALONG THE U.S.-MEXICO BORDER PLEAD FOR MORE MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c. 2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Six years after the government began boosting law
enforcement along the U.S.-Mexico border, soaring arrest rates are
stretching court caseloads to the breaking point from South Texas
to California, a group of federal judges said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think it's legitimate to fight crime and illegal
immigration, then you also need to give us the resources to finish
the job after the arrests are made,'' said Chief Judge Marilyn L.
Huff of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
California.
</P>
<P>
   Huff made the blunt comment to lawmakers at a Capitol Hill
meeting. She and six other federal judges from the Southwest called
on Congress and President Clinton to approve an 8.5 percent hike in
judiciary spending, from $4.3 billion this year to $4.6 billion in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   The federal police presence along the border has jumped sharply
since 1994. The number of immigration agents has grown by 93
percent; drug agents are up 155 percent, and the U.S. Border Patrol
alone has doubled _ to 5,000 agents.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, arrests are up 125 percent in the region. The
Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts projects that in two years
courts in the five southwest border districts will be handling
almost a third of all federal criminal cases filed in the United
States, up from a quarter of the cases now. In the border town of
Del Rio, Texas, more people were indicted on federal charges in
1998 than in Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the dramatic rise, the five districts along the
border have seen only a 30 percent increase in court staff since
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Dineen King, chief judge of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in New Orleans, said at the meeting, ``I think when our
senators and congressmen look at the numbers, they will support our
efforts.''King said evidence that the legal system in the Southwest
is in distress can be seen ``everywhere.''U.S. marshals,
responsible for guarding thousands of additional prisoners without
added resources, are dangerously outnumbered, she said. On some
occasions, two marshals are assigned to escort as many as 80
prisoners to or from court, she said.
</P>
<P>
   As federal prisons have filled, King said, marshals have been
forced to haul prisoners to jails hundreds of miles from the
border. The officers worry that they will face an escape attempt or
a riot, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Huff said that prisoners from her court in San Diego are being
housed in jails as far away as Oklahoma and Seattle. ``Every time
these prisoners need to appear in court, we have to bus them
hundreds of miles to my court, and then put them on the bus and
send them back,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside federal courthouses, security is a constant concern, King
said. A prosecutor in Tucson, Ariz., was ordered to abandon her
post when she found herself alone in a courtroom with 45 unmanacled
prisoners and only two unarmed marshals.Huff said that prosecutors
_ overwhelmed by caseloads that have doubled or tripled _ are
forced to cut deals that allow criminals to serve shorter
sentences. ``When you have 4,000 cases before eight judges, there's
no other way,'' she said.Huff said the only way her district can
handle the tidal wave of cases is to press into service six judges
who have retired, including one who is 86.U.S. District Judge
Edward C. Prado said the 10 federal judges in the western district
of Texas handle an average of 703 cases a year, just under 10 times
the national average.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about judges who are afraid to work long hours,''
he said. ``It's about a system that is being overwhelmed.''
</P>
<P>
   King said she and the other judges felt they had to come to
Washington because few lawmakers have addressed the problem in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist also has urged Congress to
add judges to the federal courts in the Southwest. Rehnquist said
earlier this year that those courts face an ``unmanageable'' trial
schedule because of illegal immigration and drug crimes in the
region. At the meeting Thursday, several lawmakers whose districts
lie along or near the border promised to push Congress to raise
spending on district courts in the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us who live on the border understand the problem and
want to help,'' said Rep. Solomon P. Ortiz, D-Texas, whose district
includes the border city of Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-Texas, who worked 26 years as a Border
Patrol agent and sector chief, said Congress should ``act to
relieve the situation.''

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `AMERICAN PSYCHO,' starring Christian Bale. Directed by Mary
Harron (R, 104 minutes). Harron's sleekly brilliant screen
adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' notorious 1991 novel pares away
most of the book's gore to portray the main character's homicidal
butchery as a high-gloss fantasy. The movie's chic blend of satire,
comedy and horror is anchored in a star-making performance by Bale
as Patrick Bateman, a fashion-obsessed late-80s Wall Street hotshot
who goes on a killing spree. Reese Witherspoon, Chloe Sevigny,
Samantha Mathis and Cara Seymour give dazzling cameo performances
as the unfortunate women in his life. The movie's message about a
soulless, surface-obsessed society still applies (Stephen Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE COLOR OF PARADISE,' starring Mohsen Ramezani and Hossein
Mahjur. Directed by Majid Majidi (PG, 90 minutes). This beautiful
Iranian movie about a widowed father who is reluctant to care for
his blind 8-year-old son is a heartbreaker done with such
conviction that it avoids mawkishness. When the special school the
boy has been attending won't keep him on, the father first takes
his son to the family's woodland homestead, then leaves him in the
care of a blind carpenter. The movie evokes nature with an ecstatic
sensuousness, and its heady soundtrack teems with the sounds of
birds, insects, wind and rain (Holden).

   `EAST-WEST,' starring Sandrine Bonnaire, Oleg Menchikov and
Catherine Deneuve. Directed by Regis Wargnier (PG-13, 115 minutes).
After World War II the Soviet government undertook a propaganda
campaign to entice Russians living in the West to return home.
Alexei Golovine (Menchikov) and his French wife, Marie (Bonnaire),
the couple at the heart of Wargnier's sumptuous, moving historical
melodrama, are luckier than most of their fellow returnees, who are
killed or imprisoned on arrival. ``East-West'' chronicles Alexei's
ambivalence about their new life in a drab, depressing communal
apartment and Marie's desperate attempts to escape it. The film may
be faulted for dissolving the horrors of history in Hollywood-style
catharsis, but it also uses the resources of old-fashioned
emotionally emphatic filmmaking to shed light on forgotten history.
``East-West'' is a grand costume pageant, full of grandeur and
period detail, but it is also the portrait of a marriage under
extreme external and internal pressure, and a showcase for two
great film actresses: Bonnaire and Deneuve, playing an actress who
becomes aware of Marie's plight during a tour of the Soviet Union
(A.O. Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `FREQUENCY,' starring Dennis Quaid and Jim Caviezel. Directed by
Gregory Hoblit (PG-13, 100 minutes). ``Back to the Future'' meets
``Field of Dreams'' meets ``It's a Wonderful Life'' meets ``The
Sixth Sense'' in this entertaining but shamelessly sentimental
supernatural soap opera with a macho heart. Caviezel is a morose
young policeman who contacts his dead father, a heroic firefighter,
on a ham radio and contrives to save him from the accident that
cost him his life during the 1969 World Series. From here, the two
collaborate on changing other aspects of the past and on catching a
serial killer. There are enough testosterone tears to soak Shea
Stadium (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `GLADIATOR,' starring Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix and Oliver
Reed (R, 150 minutes). This movie is the answer to a question no
one bothered to ask: What would happen if someone decided to film
the imminent extreme football league as if it were a Chanel
commercial? Scott subjects action-packed bouts of mayhem and
decapitation in the Roman Colosseum to his glossy, inhuman
directing style; it's admirable but repellent. Crowe is the noble
Roman general who ends up fighting for his life. Crowe gives a
performance with ball-of-fire intensity, suffused with a movie
star's impatience. He holds the movie together, such as it is
(Elvis Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `HIGH FIDELITY,' starring John Cusack, Jill Peterson, Iben
Hjejle and Joan Cusack. Directed by Stephen Frears (R, 107
minutes). Although its setting has been moved from London to
Chicago, the screen adaptation of Nick Hornby's best-selling 1995
novel is wonderfully true to the spirit of the book. Cusack has one
of his juiciest roles in Rob, a 30-something record store manager
and vinyl fanatic sorting through the ``Top 5'' breakups in his
disastrous romantic history while trying to salvage his latest
relationship. The movie hilariously captures the mind-set of
not-so-young men for whom pop music is a kind of religion and hip
musical taste an ultimate measure of a person's worth (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `I DREAMED OF AFRICA,' starring Kim Basinger and Vincent Perez.
Directed by Hugh Hudson (PG-13, 120 minutes). This screen
adaptation of Kuki Gallmann's memoir about her life in Kenya with
an adventurer husband and two children is little more than a
picturesque travelogue. Although the story is loaded with tragedy,
a stiff, expository screenplay and mostly weak performances keep it
from resonating. Basinger's spaced-out baby-doll Kuki and Perez's
petulant husband render this conservation-minded couple remote and
vaguely unsympathetic. That couldn't have been the movie's
intention (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `KEEPING THE FAITH,' starring Edward Norton, Ben Stiller and
Jenna Elfman. Directed by Norton (PG-13, 129 minutes). Norton
doubles as actor and director in this competent comedy with a
premise that's both high concept and the punch line to a barroom
joke: a priest (Norton) and a rabbi (Stiller) fall in love with a
woman (Elfman) they've known since they were children. Norton
wisely chose not to make himself the star. He places that burden on
Stiller's shoulders, and both seem to be doing Woody Allen to
compensate for the underwritten material (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `LOVE AND BASKETBALL,' starring Sanaa Lathan and Omar Epps.
Directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood (PG-13, 118 minutes). The
writer-director Gina Prince-Bythewood's feature-film debut, about
the romantic and competitive bond between the basketball players
Monica (Lathan) and Quincy (Epps), has an enchanting, lived-in
homeyness. Prince-Bythewood does a wonderful job of creating an
atmosphere for her characters _ particularly for the superb Lathan
_ but the movie fails to fashion a consistent narrative. It doesn't
seem to be about anything. But it's a promising first movie from a
filmmaker with a lot to offer. Who knew anyone could get a drama
out of Title IX, the federal law ensuring that girls get a chance
to compete in high school sports? (Mitchell).

   `RULES OF ENGAGEMENT,' starring Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L.
Jackson. Directed by William Friedkin (R, 123 minutes). The two
powerhouse actors muster all the technique they can bring to bear
for this by-the-numbers courtroom drama with flashes of bruising
action: it's like the world's most expensive episode of ``JAG,''
with bits of ``The Verdict'' mixed in for extra flavor. Jones plays
a shaky, alcoholic Marine lawyer brought in to defend his fellow
Marine (Jackson) against charges of military misconduct. Since
``Rules'' makes it clear from the outset that Jackson's character
is innocent, the only suspense comes from wondering whether Guy
Pearce, as the prosecutor, will be able to maintain his bizarre
accent (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `TIME CODE,' starring Jean Tripplehorn, Saffron Burrows, Holly
Hunter and Stellan Skarsgard. Directed by Mike Figgis (R, 93
minutes). Figgis' astonishing new film, shot in a single day with
hand-held digital video cameras, tells four stories simultaneously,
in real time. ``Time Code'' is at once a mordant satire of the
hypocrisy and self-delusion of the film industry and an earnest
declaration of faith in the medium itself. In addition to its
technical innovations, which test the limits of the human eye, ear
and mind, the film boasts some brilliant improvisational acting
from its enormous cast. Especially fine are Tripplehorn and
Skarsgard, whose strongly emotional performances add a measure of
pathos. Whether ``Time Code'' will ultimately be seen as a bold
prophecy of the dawning visual age or as a passionate, gimmicky
curio is for the future to decide. At present, though, it's hard to
think of a more exciting demonstration of the inexhaustible
possibilities of film (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `28 DAYS,' starring Sandra Bullock, Viggo Mortensen and Dominic
West. Directed by Betty Thomas (PG-13, 110 minutes). Bullock gives
a creditable performance as Gwen Cummings, a fun-loving New York
writer ordered to visit a drug and alcohol rehabilitation clinic
after a drunken car accident. Veering unsteadily between comedy and
suds, the movie portrays Gwen's fellow residents at Serenity Glen
as a bunch of goofy caricatures and confuses things further with
its dime-store psychologizing. It ultimately reduces the rehab
experience to a zany (but mostly unfunny) summer-camp farce
(Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `U-571,' starring Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton and Harvey
Keitel. Directed by Jonathan Mostow (PG-13, 120 minutes). Mostow,
whose previous film, ``Breakdown,'' was a marvel of B-picture
minimalism, shifts from the wide-open spaces to the cramped
interior of a World War II submarine movie. McConaughey, whose
knotted-with-unease face makes it look as if he's cramming for
finals, is part of a secret mission to capture a Nazi
code-encryption machine and get it back to the Allies. He and his
crew have to do so on a Nazi U-boat they have hijacked. Mostow does
a fine job of building tension, given that he's working in a minor
genre whose climactic notes you'll know if you've ever seen a movie
set on a sub (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `THE VIRGIN SUICIDES,' starring Kirsten Dunst, James Woods and
Kathleen Turner. Directed by Sofia Coppola (R, 97 minutes).
Coppola's directorial debut, in a movie adapted from Jeffrey
Eugenides' 1993 novel about the self-destruction of five sisters in
a 1970s Michigan suburb, shows her to be a filmmaker with fine
visual and emotional instincts, adept at matching the book's
hypnotic, sensual black humor. The movie's best moments have an
inspired feeling of playfulness and freedom matched by Dunst's
smart, beguiling performance as Lux Lisbon, whose sexual awakening
propels her and her sisters to their doom. But despite Coppola's
keen instincts, and the beautifully understated acting of Woods and
Turner as the Lisbon parents, ``The Virgin Suicides'' is marred by
the self-conscious aestheticism and emotional detachment of its
source (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `WHERE THE HEART IS,' starring Natalie Portman and Ashley Judd.
Directed by Matt Williams (PG-13, 115 minutes). Young Novalee
Nation (Portman) is terribly phobic about the number five, and
about five minutes into this astonishingly shameless melodrama with
its lower-class sweetheart heroine, you'll start to feel exactly
the same way. The movie seems to be stuck with its own five
fixation, too, because a new character or situation is introduced
every five minutes, or so it feels, to keep things lively.
Abandoned by her boyfriend, Novalee gives birth in a Wal-Mart. She
later befriends a nurse ( Judd), a single mom with a passel of
children, and takes up photography. The audience doesn't get credit
for being able to track a character through life without the film's
being stuffed with enough nutty incidents _ a kidnapping,
catastrophic storms _ for an entire season of television
(Mitchell).

 &HT;    Q &AMP;A with Dana Buchman
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, May 14.
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Memphis native Dana Buchman tends to portray herself as a
designer with a businesswoman's mindset. The runway shows that most
other New York-based designers stage bi-annually are, in Buchman's
opinion, too superfluous and cost-ineffective. And the celebrities
that most designers covet as clients are, in her view, so many
alien beings who really can't do much to advance her 14-year-old
signature brands or her three-decades-old career.
</P>
<P>
   Buchman, 47, made a recent personal appearance at Phipps Plaza's
Saks Fifth Avenue in Atlanta. After a runway showing of her spring
and fall collections (proceeds from which benefit the State of
Israel Bonds foundation), she sat down for a chat with fashion
editor A. Scott Walton.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What direction are you taking your clothes in response to the
casualization of the workplace?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm not into casualization. You need casual, soccer mom
clothes for the weekend, of course. And many companies are going
casual. But I notice that the women I dress _ who are not the cute
young things, but the women with more status in their organizations
_ they want to look put together.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where do your design ideas originate?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's an evolution. I always start with the color, and then
pick the fabric and make sure it works with the color. And then you
make adjustments. And silhouettes come next.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How hard do you work to stay in keeping with prevailing
trends?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't think my customer wants to be way ahead. But she
doesn't want to be behind either. The pace has picked up over the
last 10 years. Things happen all at once. So you want to look `on
trend.' But the customer I dress doesn't want what she bought to
look funny in a year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does being a native Southerner affect your work in any way?
</P>
<P>
   A: The colors I use come from the South. The South has this
great light. Have you been to New York in the winter? It's so
different. The light here makes you want to dress differently. The
other thing is I tend to do seasonless fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has your design approach changed much?
</P>
<P>
   A: I haven't changed the fundamental aesthetics, which have
always been color, fabric, femininity, fit and detail. But I have
made the line younger in the last year or two. And it's been very
well received.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why aren't you selling on the Internet yet?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think e-commerce will work for us. We're not that huge of a
company, so we thought we'd let other, bigger companies work out
the kinks first. Some of the specialty department stores we sell to
are launching sites, and we're very involved with that.

 &HT;    Swimsuits for men just got smaller
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, May 14.
 &HT;    By Ginger McFarland
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Women would be well-advised to put extra ice in those poolside
drinks this summer, because men's swimwear has the potential to
raise the heat index.
</P>
<P>
   This season's trendiest look in trunks is a cross between a
competition-style brief and a boxer brief. Retailers call them
``box-cut'' or ``square-cut.'' We call them tight and tiny.
</P>
<P>
   Prada's got a pair with little side ventilation zippers _ as if
these short shorts need ventilation. And Gucci, ever the
envelope-pusher, offers the same style in a red and white tropical
print as well as an even more daring bikini style that ties on one
side.
</P>
<P>
   This new breed of trunks is great for getting the optimum in
rays and stares from all those who wish they could look as good as
you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only the most confident of men are buying this style,'' said
Donnie Sukarome, manager of the Polo Sport store at Lenox Square.
``I only ordered a few, but we sold out as soon as they came in.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. If you don't have the confidence to pull off the box cut or
Speedo, go with the Hawaiian print broad short _ they're great for
everybody.

 &HT;    Designers put imagination and innovation into their one-piece
styles
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, May 14.
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One-piece swimsuits aren't just for coverage-conscious women
anymore. For this season, designers poured as much imagination and
innovation into their one-piece styles as they devoted to bikini
and tankini looks in the past.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the newest one-pieces burst with an array of
bright colors. Any neutral suits have the added appeal of shiny,
sleek-looking fabrication. Embellishment _ embroidered necklines,
piped trim in contrasting colors and cut-outs _ heighten the suits'
style quotient. And designers have done interesting things with
straps to draw more attention to the soft curves of women's
shoulders and reveal more of their backs.
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of reasons why one-piece suits work: more
coverage; underwire support systems that are more comfortable and
less conspicuous; and they transition more fluidly between
swimming, sunbathing, beachcombing and pool parties than bikinis
do.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget _ there's less risk of the top or bottom half
getting lost in the wash.

 &HT;    A son relives mother's death years afterward
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed For Sunday, May 14.

 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``At the end, a nurse stripped the neck brace, pressed her
fingers against the carotid artery, and felt for the faintest sign
of a pulse. The Velcro made a sound like stitches ripping.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodger Kamenetz's remembrance of his mother in ``Terra Infirma:
A Memoir of My Mother's Life in Mine'' (Schocken Books, $11
paperback) is both tender and bittersweet, with none of the false
sentimentality of a Mother's Day card. In both its lyricism and its
emotional subtlety, it recalls Russell Baker's opening sentence in
``Growing Up'': ``At the age of 80 my mother had her last bad fall,
and after that her mind wandered free through time.''
</P>
<P>
   Sons more often than daughters seem to hear a parent's
admonitory voice from beyond the grave, and seek redemption through
words that went unspoken when there was still time. But settling
accounts can be painful. Oscar
</P>
<P>
   Wilde's unsparing observation is true in more instances than we
like to acknowledge:
</P>
<P>
   ``Children begin by loving their parents. After a time they
judge them. Rarely, if ever, do they forgive them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of us are luckier than others, and it would be nice to
report that Kamenetz _ who teaches literature at Louisiana State
University _ found in his mother's agonizing death a measure of
forgiveness. It would be nice to report that his mother's last
words released him from the guilt of unfulfilled promise. But
redemption comes unbidden, like grace. ``Her dying words,'' he
writes, ``were a triumph. They hold me still in their grip.''
</P>
<P>
   Becoming `somebody'
</P>
<P>
   Kamenetz's mother _ like Baker's _ wanted him to ``be
somebody,'' but his mother's idea of being somebody had the spur of
social inferiority and the goad of envy. Miriam Kieff grew up the
abandoned child of a mother and father she tried to obliterate from
memory. Brought up by her grandfather, she dropped out of high
school at 16 and went to work at a Woolworth's store in Baltimore,
selling costume jewelry. One summer she and her sister lit out for
Atlantic City, and there she met Irvin Kamenetz, just out of the
military and with no aspirations of his own.
</P>
<P>
   His mother was always ashamed, Kamenetz writes, that she never
finished high school. Yet from that scarred childhood grew a fierce
drive to make something of herself. ``Even though both her mother
and her father abandoned her, she did not abandon herself. With her
children grown, she returned to school and graduated from college.
But she never found whatever it was she needed, and her failed
hopes would be her children's to fulfill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until I graduated from Yale,'' Kamenetz writes, ``I was my
mother's main chance.'' Alas, he graduated _ in the spring of 1970
_ from experimenting with LSD and participating in antiwar
demonstrations to pounding the pavement and sweeping floors. No one
was hiring poets that year. ``She was disappointed I didn't become
`somebody great, like Henry Kissinger.' After all, I'd gone to
Yale. She didn't realize that all I'd opened in New Haven were the
doors to perception. ... One day my brother told me, `She's given
up on you.' At last I had succeeded in failing.''
</P>
<P>
   As that passage should suggest, Kamenetz's is a portrayal both
of his mother and of himself. It is one of filial love but also
self-flagellation. And even the love that Kamenetz quite obviously
feels for his mother is streaked with bitterness. If Kamenetz is
not every mother's son, neither was Miriam Kieff the
undifferentiated figure whose motives were selfless and maternal.
</P>
<P>
   Tangled emotions
</P>
<P>
   Most of us know little of our parents' childhood. Intimately
familiar with our own childhood, we resist thinking that our
mothers and fathers once had theirs, with the same uncertainties
and insecurities. Our parents were forever adults. Then there comes
a time, usually in midlife, when we try to re-create the child who
would become our mother or our father and we draw a blank.
</P>
<P>
   In their particularities, Miriam Kieff and the infant she bore
50 years ago embodied the tangled emotions that bind families
together and, sometimes, keep them apart. The Kamenetzes were a
family that came together only at the mother's deathbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother died in the Church Home Hospice in Baltimore,''
Kamenetz writes, ``at the age of 54. Her last words were `I Love
You.' The radio was playing `Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head.'''
</P>
<P>
   That he should be in the grip of her words all these years later
tells us something of the biological bond between mother and child.
Kamenetz wanted, despite himself, to succeed for the sake of the
woman who was not herself lovable but who nonetheless gave him
life. The death of the father, Freud somewhere writes, is the
emancipation of the son. It is the death of the mother that is
relived in the quiet moments long after.

 &HT;    Dance rules saga of love, sweat, tears
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Center Stage'' is aimed at those adolescent girls who have toe
shoes dangling from their bedposts and posters of Mikhail
Baryshnikov stuck on their walls. Or of the newer dance
hearttthrob, Ethan Stiefel.
</P>
<P>
   An old-fashioned show biz fantasy with leotards and plies,
``Center Stage'' is a kind of movie that gets retooled every 10
years or so. Its antecedents include ``Fame,'' ``Dirty Dancing,''
``The Turning Point'' and even ``Flashdance.'' It's the female
version of a sports movie: Sweat and inspiration lead to love and
brief heartache, but ultimately, growth, self-worth and even
stardom result. (Instead of the Big Game, the flick climaxes with
the Big Show.)
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Schull has the Jennifer Grey/Jennifer Beals role, playing
wholesome Jody Sawyer, who lands one of the coveted spots at the
American Ballet Academy in Manhattan. Artistic director Jonathan
Reeves (Peter Gallagher) and top teacher Juliette (Donna Murphy)
make it clear from the start: At semester's end, only six of the
students (at most) will be asked to join the dance company
affiliated with the school.
</P>
<P>
   Cue the cat fights! In its early minutes, ``Center Stage''
promises to be a hopeless soap opera, tossing together young
characters designed to clash. Nice Jody winds up rooming with
tough, arrogant Eva (Zoe Saldana), who slouches in late to class
and defies the school's uniform rules. Their third roomie is
Maureen (Susan May Pratt), an uptight princess with a steely stage
mother (Debra Monk) and (no big surprise here) a streak of bulimia.
</P>
<P>
   On the Y-chromosome side of school, there's nice-guy Charlie
(Sascha Radetsky), who has his eye on Jody. But she's smitten with
choreographer Cooper (Stiefel, ABT's real-life dance star), who not
only moves like a god but rides a Harley.
</P>
<P>
   Stage-turned-screen director Nicholas Hytner (``The Madness of
King George'') knows ballet, and he relishes the demanding work it
requires. The movie underscores the cruel physical imperatives of
the discipline, from Maureen's eating disorders to the widespread
mockery of a student who's packing a few pounds more than the
rail-thin ideal.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Center Stage'' is not exactly a backstage expose. Its main
purpose is to entertain, and even the rivalries among the
characters melt away. The movie goes exactly where you expect:
Jody's eyes are opened to the man who really loves her; Eva stops
throwing attitude and gets serious about her dancing; Maureen
stands up to mom and dares to eat pizza.
</P>
<P>
   There's something sweet about the movie's familiar formula, its
generosity toward its characters. More demanding adults should
remember that this is geared for teenagers (though it doesn't shy
away from some discreet sexual situations). The actors were chosen
mostly because they can dance; it's a kick to see them leap and
spin without stunt doubles. On the downside, these kids can
sometimes underwhelm in the acting department, but never painfully.
</P>
<P>
   Prized stage choreographer Susan Stroman (``Contact,''
``Chicago'') choreographed the numbers, which include classical
ballet moves, a high-energy Broadway dance class, some salsa
dancing and the big, climactic show performed by the students.
</P>
<P>
   In this last big sequence, Hytner gleefully goes over the top,
daring us to complain when he tosses reality to the wind. (For
example, Schull, dancing the lead role, goes through several
costumes and hairstyles without leaving the stage.) Young dance
lovers won't care. Neither will adults with gently lowered
expectations. ``Center Stage'' may be softheaded and hokey, but
it's bighearted. And it knows how to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Center Stage''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ethan Stiefel, Amanda Schull and Zoe Saldana. Rated
PG-13 for language and sensuality. 1 hour,
</P>
<P>
   53 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A simplistic but sweet-natured film designed to
make young dance lovers swoon.

 &HT;    This `Traffic' takes all the wrong turns
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A rave film from Wales _ now there's a phrase I never thought
I'd use _ this frenetic exercise in uselessness covers one lost
weekend in Cardiff, as some dead-end twentysomethings drink, drug,
club-hop, have sex, don't have sex and deliver some of the most
drearily self-conscious dialogue this side of a ``Real World''
reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Our main narrator is Jip (John Simm), a clothing store clerk,
who knows his Scorsese and knows his Ecstasy (as in the designer
drug) but isn't sure he'll ever find true love. Or even someone
who'll sleep with him. Conveniently, his best mate is Lulu
(Lorraine Pilkington), a comely, funny, available blonde with whom
he has a supposedly platonic relationship _ that is, they keep each
other company from club to club.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Koop (Shaun Parkes), a connoisseur of vintage
vinyl. The only thing he loves more than his LPs is his girlfriend,
Nina (Nicola Reynolds), of whom he is inordinately _ and wrongly _
jealous. Finally, there's Moff (Danny Dyer), who's around mostly to
mouth off at his clueless conservative parents and spew a stoned
``Star Wars'' deconstruction that's pretty much a rip-off of a
similar incoherent movie-geek riff in Kevin Smith's ``Clerks.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Jip, director Justin Kerrigan knows his drugs and his movie
references _ from ``Taxi Driver'' to ``Trainspotting.'' What he
doesn't know is anything about characters or storytelling or any of
those niceties that would make this picture something more than a
pretentious generational whine.
</P>
<P>
   The film opens with footage of a real rave, and you can feel the
brutal energy bursting off the screen. So a rave movie from Wales
may not be such a bad idea after all. But once Jip and crew move
front and center _ and stoned _ ``Human Traffic'' becomes as
frustrating as being stuck in traffic. The motorized kind. And, as
all of us who live in Atlanta know, you don't need to go to a movie
for that.

It's movie garbage.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, Steve Murray and Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``28 Days'' PG-13 (profanity, substance
</P>
<P>
   abuse and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sandra Bullock
</P>
<P>
   and Viggo Mortensen.
</P>
<P>
   The cinema's chipper girl next door (Sandra Bullock) goes clean
and sober in an addiction and rehab movie that, thankfully, isn't
an appalling clinical ``comedy'' like ``Patch Adams.'' It's a
professional, appealing comedy-drama, but in trying to be all
things to all viewers (to beer-loving Bullock fans as well as
devoted 12-steppers), it never really comes into focus. (SM)1 hour,
43 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Across the Sea of Time'' G
</P>
<P>
   3-D Imax film
</P>
<P>
   about New York City.
</P>
<P>
   History comes alive visually in this 3-D Imax movie focusing on
New York City. It's full of big, gloriously detailed ``stereoview''
photographs depicting immigrant life at the turn of the century.
(Bob Longino)51 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Center Stage'' PG-13 (sexuality and language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ethan Stiefel,
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Schull and Zoe Saldana.
</P>
<P>
   An old-fashioned show biz fantasy for teenagers with leotards
and plies, ``Center Stage'' is a kind of movie that gets retooled
every 10 years or so. Its antecedents include ``Fame,'' ``Dirty

</P>
<P>
   ``East Is East'' R (profanity
</P>
<P>
   and domestic violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Om Puri
</P>
<P>
   and Linda Bassett.
</P>
<P>
   Set in working-class Britain in 1971, this uneven but energetic
film focuses on a boisterous Anglo-Pakistani family. The father is
a tyrannical type, while the mother is a grounded fish-and-chips
Englishwoman. And the kids are totally caught up in the exploding
England Swings pop-culture surrounding them. The very good cast,
headed by Om Puri and Linda Bassett, is a huge asset. (ERG) 1 hour,
36 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Erin Brockovich'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Julia Roberts
</P>
<P>
   and Albert Finney.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Roberts delivers in a funny, down-to-earth film about an
everyday mom with business spunk who, without a law degree but with
a lot of pluck, helps crash a big-time company responsible for
devastating health problems in a small, dirt-poor town. Call it
``Working-Class Girl.'' (Bob Longino) 2 hours, 11 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Frequency'' PG-13 (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Dennis Quaid
</P>
<P>
   and Jim Caviezel.
</P>
<P>
   John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel) hears dead people. Specifically, he
hooks up to his dad's old ham radio set in 1999 and finds himself
talking to his dad (Dennis Quaid) in 1969. More crucially, John
knows his dad, a fireman, will be killed in a failed heroic rescue
the next day. Although over-plotted, the sentimental film has that
``what if?'' fascination. It's also a mind-bender and especially
savvy about emotional button-pushing. (ERG) 2 hours. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Gladiator'' R (extreme violence,
</P>
<P>
   perverse sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Russell Crowe.
</P>
<P>
   Two thousand _ or, if you want to add computer effects, 200,000
_ thumbs up for Ridley Scott's spectacle starring Russell Crowe as
a Roman general, who returns to the Colosseum to take revenge on
the odious Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). The battles staged
before the mob of mindless ancient Romans are the film's
centerpieces, but its brave heart (so to speak) is Crowe. (ERG) 2
hours, 33 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``High Fidelity'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Cusack,
</P>
<P>
   Iben Hjejle and Jack Black.
</P>
<P>
   Freshly dumped by his longtime girlfriend, record-store owner
Rob (John Cusack) rhetorically asks himself, ``What came first _
music or the misery?'' In other words, does he listen to songs
about heartbreak because he's miserable, or is he miserable because
he's listening to these songs? ``High Fidelity'' is as smart as it
is enjoyable. It's a great date movie about dating. (SM)1 hour, 54
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Human Traffic'' R (sex, profanity, nudity
</P>
<P>
   and strong drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Simm.
</P>
<P>
   Movie garbage. In this rave flick from Wales, five
twenty-somethings spend their usual lost weekend drinking, doing
drugs, club-hopping, having sex, not having sex and delivering some
of the most drearily self-conscious dialogue this side of a ``Real
World'' reunion. You've seen ``Monkees'' reruns edgier than this.
(ERG)1 hour, 24 minutes. D-
</P>
<P>
   ``I Dreamed of Africa'' PG-13 (nudity, sensuality
</P>
<P>
   and some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kim Basinger
</P>
<P>
   and Vincent Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Cardboard figures have adventures in Africa. Oscar winner Kim
Basinger stars as real-life woman Kuki Gallmann, who up and moves
her family from Italy to the Dark Continent because, as she tells
her son, ``I've stopped growing.'' Directed by one-hit wonder Hugh
Hudson (``Chariots of Fire''), the movie never slows down long
enough to get inside the heads of its characters. (SM) 1 hour, 54
minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Keeping the Faith'' PG-13 (profanity, sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Stiller,
</P>
<P>
   Edward Norton and Jenna Elfman.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, it's a sweet-natured hymn to love and longtime
friendship. Edward Norton (as a priest) and Ben Stiller (as a
rabbi) are pals whose childhood friend (Jenna Elfman) returns to
catch both their eyes in more than a friendly way. The first 90
minutes have charm, a sophisticated sexiness and some nice, offbeat
bits. Then things start to crash. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   2 hours, 9 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Love and Basketball'' PG-13 (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Omar Epps
</P>
<P>
   and Sanaa Lathan.
</P>
<P>
   All's not fair in love or basketball is one of several themes in
this flawed but appealing romance. Q (Omar Epps) and Monica (Sanaa
Lathan) meet as kids and rival basketball players. They realize
throughout the film that they love each other as much as the game.
Director Gina Price-Bythewood (her producer is Spike Lee) may not
have scored a slam dunk, but she comes close thanks to her engaging
stars. (ERG)1 hour, 58 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Jordan to the Max'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Imax documentary
</P>
<P>
   about Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   It shoots, it scores. Like Mount Everest, Michael Jordan has his
own 2-D Imax film. It's the biggest format for the biggest sports
story ever told. Part bio, part well-deserved pat on the back, it's
a loving look at the Chicago Bulls superstar and hones in on the
1998 NBA playoffs when a determined Jordan led his team to a sixth
championship before retirement. (Bob Longino) 45 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``My Dog Skip'' PG (violent content and mild profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Frankie Muniz,
</P>
<P>
   Diane Lane and Kevin Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the late Willie Morris' memoir about growing up in
small-town 1940s Mississippi, this family film is a remembrance of
how things can pass from our lives but never really leave us.
Nine-year-old Willie (``Malcolm in the Middle's'' Frankie Muniz) is
a shy only child whose life changes when his mom (Diane Lane) gives
him a Jack Russell terrier puppy, despite dad's (Kevin Bacon)
objection. (ERG)1 hour, 35 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Old Man and the Sea'' Unrated.
</P>
<P>
   A live-action animated short.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar: best animated short. This 'toon, based on Ernest
Hemingway's novel, is, like the author's word choice, deceptively
simple and strikingly beautiful. It's everything a moviegoer would
expect, but didn't get, from ``Fantasia/2000.'' (Bob Longino) 22
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Return to Me'' PG (mild violence and sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring David Duchovny
</P>
<P>
   and Minnie Driver.
</P>
<P>
   In what may be Hollywood's first organ-transplant romance,
bereaved widower David Duchovny falls for shy heart-transplant
recipient Minnie Driver, unaware that his beloved first wife's
ticker is beating inside her chest. Duchovny is actually rather
wonderful here, with a sweet pensive romanticism. But Driver
herself just doesn't seem worthy of Duchovny. (ERG) 1 hour, 56
minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Road to El Dorado'' PG (mild thematic material
</P>
<P>
   and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Animated film featuring the voices
</P>
<P>
   of Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh.
</P>
<P>
   Not cute enough for kids, not clever enough for adults,
DreamWorks' latest animated feature is gorgeous but curiously dull.
Kenneth Branagh and Kevin Kline are the voices of a couple of
16th-century scam artists looking for the Lost City of Gold in the
New World. The movie fuses visual splendor with unsteady
storytelling and tone. The waterfalls are beautiful, but the movie
is a washout. (SM) 1 hour, 23 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Rules of Engagement'' R (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tommy Lee Jones
</P>
<P>
   and Samuel L. Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rules of Engagement'' is another military flick that climaxes
in a courtroom, where soldiers shout out conflicting reports of
what really happened in the heat of battle. ``Rules'' is laughable,
but it's watchable thanks to the leads. Tommy Lee Jones is the
flick's anchor. And Samuel L. Jackson delivers an on-the-stand
blow-up like Jack Nicholson's ``You-can't-handle-the-truth''
bluster from ``A Few Good Men.'' (SM) 2 hours, 7 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Skulls'' PG-13 (violence and brief sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joshua Jackson
</P>
<P>
   and Paul Walker.
</P>
<P>
   In this conspiracy thriller for the Clearasil set, the WB's
Joshua Jackson plays an average Joe sucked into an elite, monied
club. It comes with a price, though. Like he can't ever get out.
(SM) 1 hour, 47 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Time Code'' R (drug use, sexuality, l
</P>
<P>
   anguage and some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Stellan Skarsgard,
</P>
<P>
   Salma Hayek and Jeanne Tripplehorn.
</P>
<P>
   The medium is the message in Mike Figgis' sometimes terrific,
sometimes tedious experiment in digital filmmaking. Here's the
gimmick: the screen is divided into four parts showing simultaneous
action in real time involving a large cast of characters. The
film's technique and technology are fresh. The story isn't. The
plot devices are moldy: A jealous lover. An estranged wife. A lying
sexpot. A loaded gun. (SM)1 hour, 37 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``U-571'' PG-13 (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew McConaughey,
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Keitel, Bill Paxton
</P>
<P>
   and Jon Bon Jovi.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew McConaughey leads a reconnaissance mission to take over
a damaged German sub and capture the secret Nazi coding device
that's confounding U.S. efforts to win the war. Despite a
predictable script, blatant cliches and a penchant for
chest-beating fanfare music, ``U-571'' has plenty of furious
action, occasional suspense and lots of super-loud booms. It's no
``Das Boot,'' but it can suck you in. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 56
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Up at the Villa'' PG-13 (language, violence
</P>
<P>
   and implied sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sean Penn
</P>
<P>
   and Kristin Scott Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Some aristo-Brits overstay their welcome in 1930s Italy. Among
them are a young but penniless widow (Kristin Scott Thomas), a
dashing ne'er-do-well (Sean Penn) with more than a dash of Bogey in
him and a gossipy princess (Anne Bancroft) in love with her own
poisonous bons mots. Despite having a familiar theme and
shallowness, the movie profits from the leads' chemistry and from
Penn's performance. (ERG) 1 hour, 55 minutes. C+

 &HT;    Experimental `Time Code' a wild ride that registers as addictive
cerebral thrill
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The medium is the message in Mike Figgis' ``Time Code,'' a
sometimes terrific, sometimes tedious experiment in digital
filmmaking. As a demonstration of new technology and actors'
chutzpah, it's remarkable. As entertainment, it's often flat and
hackneyed.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the gimmick: Intrigued by the possibilities of digital
cameras _ they're cheap and can shoot up to 93 minutes without a
break _ Figgis (``Leaving Las Vegas'') came up with a basic story
line. Then he hired and rehearsed more than 20 actors to play
interconnected characters in the plot, largely improvising their
roles over a 90-minute framework. Finally, he loosed four cameramen
(including himself) to shoot their performances in simultaneous,
synchronized takes.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, what you get in ``Time Code'' is a single story
told in four parts, shown simultaneously on a screen divided into
quadrants. If that sounds confusing, think of it this way: If one
character walking on a sidewalk suddenly ducks into an office
building, the camera may follow him inside. Or it may stay put,
letting the actor disappear from one screen and reappear on another
as he wanders into range of the next camera. (Most of the action
takes place within a few square blocks, letting characters interact
in amusing ways.) Meanwhile, the audio track constantly shifts from
one of the four frames to the next. Throughout the movie, Figgis
chooses which audio channel we listen to; at first you may be
frustrated by not being able to choose for yourself which
conversation to follow.
</P>
<P>
   The film's technique and technology are fresh. The story isn't.
Though it's set in the sharky contemporary world of Hollywood
filmmaking, the plot devices are moldy: A jealous lover. An
estranged wife. A lying sexpot. A loaded gun.
</P>
<P>
   The film's main setting is a film company's offices, where
executives _ played by Steven Weber, Xander Berkeley and Holly
Hunter among others _ anxiously await Alex (Stellan Skarsgard),
their founding producer. Separated from his wife (Saffron Burrows),
he's been drinking too much, and his colleagues worry if he's
prepared for that day's meeting with international star Ana (Mia
Maestro). Simultaneously, wealthy Lauren (Jeanne Tripplehorn) rides
in a limousine toward the production office, along with her lover
Rose (Salma Hayek), a would-be actress whom Lauren suspects is
having an affair. Other notable characters include another actress
(Leslie Mann), a masseuse (Julian Sands) who rubs down his clients
even as they conduct staff meetings, and Ana's rock star boyfriend
(Alessandro Nivola).
</P>
<P>
   When Ana pitches a movie idea to Alex, describing an experiment
exactly like the one we're watching, he replies, ``It's the most
pretentious crap I ever heard.'' This kind of self- referential
mockery is one of the movie's pluses, balancing out its unfocused
and melodramatic moments. There's also frisky chat about fake
Hollywood projects, including a movie from the ``South Park''
creators called ``Time Toilet.''
</P>
<P>
   At its best, ``Time Code'' is like a dance or musical
composition _ for example, when all four screens zoom in on a
closeup of separate actors, or the moment when two actresses, in
different zones and for different reasons, start crying. Wherever
they happen to be, the actors have to pretend to be knocked around
by three fake earthquake tremors, in synch. It's Figgis' way of
showing off, reminding us that their improvisations are harnessed
to a rigidly timed framework. Also testing the limits of nonstop
filming, two of the actors have to simulate a full-bore (if fully
clothed) sex act, without the usual safety net of cuts or the
editing room. And several times, two cameramen converge on the same
room or street corner to cover the same scene, heightening the
suspense: Will they accidentally film each other?
</P>
<P>
   Moments like these are enthralling for any film buff. But your
strongest response to ``Time Code'' will probably be cerebral, not
emotional. As usual, Figgis resorts to some overemphatic music
choices for the soundtrack, including his own jazz compositions.
Cast standouts include Skarsgard as a sympathetic emotional wreck,
and Tripplehorn, who is stuck for most of the running time with a
camera inches from her face, recording every tiny reaction as she
eavesdrops on other characters. Even though it's dramatically
undernourished, you'll know ``Time Code'' has cast a spell on you
when you don't want to leave your seat before the very last of the
four frames has faded from the screen, for fear of missing
something.

<P>
   Starring Stellan Skarsgard, Salma Hayek, Jeanne Tripplehorn and
Saffron Burrows. Rated R for drug use, sexuality, language and
violence. At Tara. 1 hour, 37 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: An ambitious experiment in synchronous digital
filmmaking, but more likely to appeal to your head than your gut.

 &HT;    A multiplex of happenings
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, May 14.
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   From this Friday's ``Dinosaur'' to August's filmed-in-Savannah
``The Legend of Bagger Vance,'' it's going to be a long, hot,
crowded summer at the multiplex. Here's a selected listing of
coming movies (as always, dates are subject to change):
</P>
<P>
   MAY
</P>
<P>
   ``Dinosaur'' _ Disney's done everything traditional about this
movie _ the story, the catch phrase jokes, the mostly sugarcoated
fantasy _ except the visuals.
</P>
<P>
   It's a $200 million eye-popping 71 minutes of computer animation
and live action often mesmerizing in its detail. We dare you not to
get sucked in as a meteor shower pummels the earth, sending shock
waves, earthly debris, fire and brimstone across the screen.
</P>
<P>
   The dinos are often remarkable _ until some of them open their
mouths and speak like they're in ``Dumbo'' (the voices include D.B.
Sweeney, Alfre Woodard, Julianna Margulies, Joan Plowright and
Della Reese). It's a weird, jolting mix of prehistoric chaos and
modern schmaltz. (Friday)
</P>
<P>
   ``Mission: Impossible 2'' _ Chinese director John Woo has pumped
American movies before. Remember ``Face/Off''? Now Woo's got his
trigger finger on the sequel to Tom Cruise's 1996 version of TV's
popular spy series. The film's trailer hints at a wild motorcycle
chase, high-climbing cliff antics, a way, way up stealth drop and
some fancy footwork by Cruise to kick a nemesis in the kisser. Oh,
yeah. And there's a plot. Maybe something about a deadly virus.
(May 24)
</P>
<P>
   Also in May
</P>
<P>
   ``East-West'' _ Catherine Deneuve heads Regis Wargnier's (whose
``Indochine'' won the 1992 best foreign language film Oscar) film
about Russian emigrants who returned from France to the motherland
under Josef Stalin only to discover deception and loss of freedom.
(Friday)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Kahuna'' _ Fresh off his best actor Oscar for
``American Beauty,'' Kevin Spacey blazes onscreen in this
independent film about salesmen and salesmanship. The script is no
``Glengarry Glen Ross,'' but Spacey and co-stars Danny DeVito and
Peter Facinelli deliver credible performances. (Friday)
</P>
<P>
   ``Small Time Crooks'' _ Some say Woody Allen's latest comedy is
a kind of throwback to his earliest films such as ``Take the Money
and Run.'' We wouldn't go that far. But it does contain a sizable
helping of weightless hilarity while poking fun at America's need
for greed. The physical comedy scores as well as the one-liners as
Allen, as an ex-con dishwasher, and Tracey Ullman, as his
manicurist wife, plot a New York bank robbery. The robbery never
works, but they do stumble their way into a whole lot of cash.
(Friday)
</P>
<P>
   ``Road Trip'' _ Was college really like this? Yeah, in many ways
it probably was. A quartet of guys heads out to try and retrieve a
sex video one of them has accidentally sent to his girlfriend. The
film, produced by Ivan Reitman (``Animal House,'' ``Ghostbusters'')
and filmed in Georgia last year, is full of sex jokes, gross-outs
(including one that should make you queasier than ``American
Pie''), insults and stereotypes. Tom Green's the name star, but he
appears mostly at the beginning and end. (Friday)
</P>
<P>
   ``Bossa Nova'' _ It's a romantic comedy with Amy Irving
involving several couples in Rio de Janeiro juiced with the beat of
Antonio Carlos ``Tom'' Jobim's music. (May 26)
</P>
<P>
   ``Shanghai Noon'' _ Jackie Chan's latest martial arts chop sends
him to the Old West, where he tries to rescue a kidnapped Chinese
princess (Lucy Liu). (May 26)
</P>
<P>
   ``Passion of Mind'' _ Demi Moore looks forlorn as a woman with
two lives _ as a mother in France and a slut in New York. One is
only a dream, but she doesn't know which. (May 26)
</P>
<P>
   JUNE
</P>
<P>
   ``The Perfect Storm'' _ A fish story with bite. Based on
Sebastian Junger's gripping book, George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg,
Diane Lane and John C. Reilly man the fishing ships as nature
convenes three storm systems, creating the most wretched storm in
modern history. A perfect sign that the action should be good: The
director is Wolfgang Petersen, who helmed ``Das Boot'' to six Oscar
nominations. The ships-at-sea scenes were shot in a huge indoor set
with ship models, a massive water tank and large blue screen. One
new gimmick involves suspended platforms so that cameras could be
moved more fluidly through a swaying
</P>
<P>
   ship. (June 30)
</P>
<P>
   Also in June
</P>
<P>
   ``Running Free'' _ A horse tale. Young Chase Moore plays a
stable boy in Namibia who befriends a colt dubbed Lucky. (June 2)
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamlet'' _ Ethan Hawke, Julia Stiles, Bill Murray and Sam
Shepard take the Bard to modern-day New York for murder, a hostile
corporate takeover and emotional lamenting. Michael Almereyda
adapted the screenplay and directed. (June 2)
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Momma's House'' _ Martin Lawrence plays an FBI guy who has
to impersonate a large granny to remain undercover in Georgia to
help protect a single mom and her son from an escaped con. It's
``Witness'' meets ``Mrs. Doubtfire.'' (June 2)
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone in 60 Seconds'' _ It's the hearing that goes first. You
may not have any after producer Jerry Bruckheimer (``Top Gun,''
``The Rock,'' ``Armageddon'') turns up the volume in this loud
homage to car thievery. Nicolas Cage is the cagey wheeler-dealer,
but he's only doing it to save his brother. The cast also includes
Oscar winner Angelina Jolie, Giovanni Ribisi, Delroy Lindo, Will
Patton and Robert Duvall. (June 9)
</P>
<P>
   ``Titan A.E.'' _ The A.E. stands for ``After Earth.'' And it's
the animated story of a teen out to save what's left of the human
race by finding a legendary spacecraft. Stars' voices include Matt
Damon, Bill Pullman, Drew Barrymore and Nathan Lane. It's ``2001:
</P>
<P>
   A Space Odyssey'' meets ``The
</P>
<P>
   Lion King.'' (June 16)
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaft'' _ This time Samuel L. Jackson is the coolly bad (shut
your mouth). He plays the nephew of John Shaft (Richard Roundtree
in a cameo) who's out to protect a murder witness (Oscar nominee
Toni Collette). Director John Singleton says he's ditched the
bell-bottoms of the 1971 original, but Isaac Hayes' Oscar-winning
theme song is reportedly intact. Co-stars include Christian Bale,
Jennifer Esposito, Dan Hedaya, Busta Rhymes and Vanessa L.
Williams. (June 16)
</P>
<P>
   ``Fantasia/2000'' _ It's already played on Imax's big, big
screen, but now Disney's heavily computer-animated version of the
original 'toons to classical tunes heads into regular-size
theaters. (June 16)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Butterfly'' _ Fernando Fernan Gomez (``The Grandfather'')
stars in this Spanish tale of a teacher who instructs a shy young
boy about the ways of the world as civil war erupts. (June 16)
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys and Girls'' _ So where did ``The Blair Witch Project's''
Heather go? She got sucked into a twentysomething relationship
film. Heather Donahue is among the supporting cast as Freddie
Prinze Jr. and Claire Forlani play childhood opposites who wind up
dangerously close in college. Also lending support: Atlanta-based
singer Monica. (June 16)
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene'' _ Oscar doesn't like him. But the
Farrelly brothers are giving Jim Carrey a try. Here he plays a
Rhode Island cop with a split personality. And both fall for Renee
Zellwegger. Apparently, it takes two to complete her. (June 23)
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicken Run'' _ Sort of a ``Babe'' in the henhouse, it's ``The
Great Escape'' all over again with clay animation and fowl voices
provided by Mel Gibson, Julia Sawalha, Miranda Richardson and Jane
Horrocks. (June 23)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patriot'' _ Partially filmed in South Carolina, Mel Gibson
goes revolutionary as a reluctant hero in early America's break
with the Brits. It sounds a lot like James Stewart's
``Shenandoah,'' though that was a different war and century.
Directed by Roland Emmerich (``Independence Day,'' ``Godzilla'').
(June 30)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle'' _ Watch them try to
pull a movie out of their hat. The 'toon villains _ Boris Badenov
(Jason Alexander), Natasha (Rene Russo) and Fearless Leader (Robert
De Niro) _ jump into the real world while heroes Rocky and
Bullwinkle are strictly animated. Think ``Who Framed Roger
Rabbit.'' Among the cameos: Billy Crystal and John Goodman. (June
30)
</P>
<P>
   ``Groove'' _ Basically, it's ``Go'' without the energy and humor
and with endless rave music. During one long night, ravers take
drugs, dance, kiss the wrong people, hug, talk, party and prove
that relationships haven't changed in hundreds of years. But the
music sure has. (June 30)
</P>
<P>
   ``Kikujiro'' _ Writer/director Takeshi Kitano is known for
police-gang wars, blazing guns and pools of blood. Not this time.
It's a comedy. And we'll tell you this: The characters include Fat
Biker and Bald Biker. (June 30)
</P>
<P>
   JULY
</P>
<P>
   ``What Lies Beneath'' _ It's got name talent all the way around.
Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer star. Robert Zemeckis directs.
It's a $65 million supernatural thriller shot in Vermont from a
story by Steven Spielberg. Can you see dead people? It appears
Pfeiffer's character might. (July 21)
</P>
<P>
   ``Loser'' _ ``American Beauty's'' Mena Suvari portrays a
downtrodden New York University student who falls for a nerdy guy
(Jason Biggs of ``American Pie''). The writer/director is Amy
Heckerling (``Clueless,'' ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High''). (July
21)
</P>
<P>
   Also in July
</P>
<P>
   ``Scary Movie'' _ Keenen Ivory Wayans does his comedy thing on
the ``Scream'' series. Among the stars: Carmen Electra and, of
course, Marlon and Shawn Wayans. (July 7)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kid'' _ Hey, it's Bruce Willis and a little boy. But this
one is different. Willis plays an image consultant who comes face
to face with himself as an 8-year-old kid. (July 7)
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus' Son'' _ Billy Crudup plays a drugged-up wanderer who
gets into weird situations. (July 7)
</P>
<P>
   ``X-Men'' _ The comic book phenom heads for the big screen with
a weird cast. Ian McKellen, Halle Berry (in blond wig), Anna
Paquin, Bruce Davison and Patrick Stewart. The reason to see it:
Ray Park (aka Darth Maul and ``Sleepy Hollow's'' headless
horseman). (July 14)
</P>
<P>
   ``Pokemon 2'' _ Don't say we didn't warn you. Last year's
mind-blowingly bad animated cash cow is back promising to introduce
six new characters. Can in-store toys be far behind? Betcha your
kid won't want to buy just one. (July 21)
</P>
<P>
   ``Mad About Mambo'' _ ``Felicity's'' Keri Russell plays a
Belfast girl who sort of flashdances the samba, rumba and, yes, the
mambo. (July 21)
</P>
<P>
   ``Thomas and the Magic Railroad'' _ Part live action, part
animation, it's the big screen version of the TV series ``Thomas
the Tank Engine and Friends.'' The movie involves a little girl on
her way to see her grandpa when she gets on the wrong train, meets
a magical conductor and winds up in a toy world. And we're serious
when we say it features Peter Fonda and Alec Baldwin. (July 26)
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonderland'' _ A drama of a family's three generations
spending time in London over a weekend. (July 28)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Broken Hearts League'' _ It's a friends film where all the
guy pals are gay. The cast includes Zack Braff, Dean Cain, Andrew
Keegan, Nia Long, Mary McCormack and Timothy Olyphant. It's written
and directed by Greg Berlanti. (July)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wisdom of Crocodiles'' _ This one's been on the shelf for
a while, and now that Jude Law got a supporting Oscar nomination
for ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' maybe you'll get to see it. Law
plays a serial killer who ices the femmes who love him. (July)
</P>
<P>
   ``Blood Simple'' _ Those ``Fargo'' guys _ Joel and Ethan Coen _
got their start in 1985 with this offbeat tale of jealousy, a cheap
saloon and planned murder. Frances McDormand, M. Emmet Walsh and
Dan Hedaya star. For the film's 15th anniversary, it's been
restored and re-edited. (July)
</P>
<P>
   ``Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her'' _ Glenn Close,
Calista Flockhart, Cameron Diaz and Holly Hunter lead a group of
actresses playing Californians in interconnected tales of romantic
yearnings, disease, lost dreams and newfound loves. (July)
</P>
<P>
   AUGUST
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'' _ It'll be all Eddie
Murphy all the time as he reprises his dual role as an overweight
professor who after taking a magic potion turns into Buddy Love.
Again, Murphy will layer on the prosthetics to play the outlandish
Klump clan: mama, papa, brother Ernie and granny. (Aug. 4)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Legend of Bagger Vance'' _ Filmed in Savannah and
Charleston, S.C., last year for $70 million, it's Robert Redford's
homage to golf with Matt Damon, Will Smith and Charlize Theron in a
tale about a mysterious caddie with a perfect swing. Locations
include the Jekyll Island Club, Colleton River Plantation and
Kiawah Island's Ocean Course. (Aug. 4)
</P>
<P>
   ``Godzilla 2000'' _ Maybe he's finally back where he belongs.
The 180-foot-high creature returns to the Land of the Rising Sun in
this Japanese-made action/adventure. It's Godzilla vs. an alien
monster. The director is Takao Okawara. (Aug. 11)
</P>
<P>
   Also in August
</P>
<P>
   ``Coyote Ugly'' _ Now Bruckheimer's turning up the steam. This
is the producer's film about young, scantily clad women living life
to the fullest as barmaids at the crazy Coyote Ugly, New York's
hottest nightspot. (Aug. 4)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hollow Man'' _ Kevin Bacon becomes an invisible fellow in
this thriller about secret formulas and danger. Co-starring as
scientists are Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin. Watch out, the
director is Paul Verhoeven (``Robocop,'' ``Basic Instinct,''
``Showgirls''). (Aug. 4)
</P>
<P>
   ``Space Cowboys'' _ Here's proof that baby boomers are older
than they think they are. Astronauts from the '60s are summoned by
NASA to save the planet from a satellite crisis _ if they can pass
rigorous physical tests. Among the geezer stars: Clint Eastwood,
Tommy Lee Jones, James Garner, Donald Sutherland and William
Devane. (Aug. 4)
</P>
<P>
   ``Bait'' _ Jamie Foxx stars in this prison comedy about a
released con who could lead authorities to a major criminal and the
whereabouts of gold from a heist. (Aug. 8)
</P>
<P>
   ``Summer Catch'' _ Freddie Prinze Jr. is the poor boy who falls
for a rich girl. (Aug. 11)
</P>
<P>
   ``Imposter'' _ A futuristic thriller with Gary Sinise as a
well-respected scientist who wakes up one day to discover he's the
world's most-wanted bad guy. (Aug. 11)
</P>
<P>
   ``Shower'' _ It's a Chinese film about traditions being overrun
by modern culture. It stars Zhu Xu (``King of Masks'') and is from
co-writer/director Zhang Yang, a pioneer in the nation's
underground music video scene. (Aug. 11)
</P>
<P>
   ``Cecil B. DeMented'' _ What you need to know is that it's
written and directed by John Waters, and it's a kind of
``Bowfinger'' on hallucinogens. Stephen Dorff leads a team of
cinema terrorists who kidnap a Hollywood star (Melanie Griffith)
and force her to film an underground renegade movie. Naturally,
Patricia Hearst co-stars. (Aug. 11)
</P>
<P>
   ``Bedazzled'' _ Elizabeth Hurley plays the devil (we believe she
can do it) who turns a nerdy, low-level techie (Brendan Fraser)
into a rich, powerful and sexy guy. Co-written and directed by
Harold Ramis. (Aug. 11)
</P>
<P>
   ``Get Carter'' _ Sylvester Stallone just won't give up. Here he
is again in an action/adventure based on the '70s British film
about a brother's strange murder. Co-starring are Miranda
Richardson, Rachel Leigh Cook and Michael Caine (who was in the
original). Didn't Billy Crystal tell us Caine will appear in
anything? (Aug. 13)
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring It On'' _ That ``Virgin Suicides'' vixen Kirsten Dunst
as the captain of a cheerleading squad trying to repeat as national
champions. Uh, it's a comedy. (Aug. 18)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Way of the Gun'' _ It's about cold-blooded criminals
suddenly wrestling with their consciences. Ryan Phillipe and
Benicio Del Toro play the baddies who kidnap a pregnant Juliette
Lewis. It's all firearms and sentimental impulses from there. (Aug.
25)
</P>
<P>
   ``Blow Dry'' _ The screenwriter for ``The Full Monty'' takes on
a full head of hair. In this comedy, a sleepy (even boring)
working-class town finds itself host of the prestigious National
Hair Championships and all the glam hams that come with it. The
cast includes Alan Rickman, Natasha Richardson and Rachel
Griffiths. (Aug. 25)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Crew'' _ Just what you want to see. A band of geezers
fighting to save their ratty senior citizen residence hotel from an
invasion of yuppies. The cast includes Richard Dreyfuss, Burt
Reynolds, Dan Hedaya and Seymour Cassel. (Aug. 25)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Replacements'' _ Not to be confused with Oliver Stone's
``Any Given Sunday,'' Keanu Reeves plays a scab quarterback in this
pigskin tale. The movie co-stars Gene Hackman. (Aug. 25)
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas Rangers'' _ TV stars (Dylan McDermott and James Van Der
Beek) and singers (Usher Raymond and Randy Travis) saddle up in
1875 Texas to take on a band of renegades. (Aug. 25)
</P>
<P>
   ``Whipped'' _ Amanda Peet stars in this comedy about New York
dating. (August)

   WASHINGTON _ Despite the advantages of peace, prosperity and
incumbency, Al Gore trails George W. Bush in most public opinion
polls, partly because a sizeable number of Americans don't seem to
like the vice president as a person.
</P>
<P>
   ``He clearly rubs some people the wrong way,'' said Ed Goeas, a
Republican pollster and co-publisher of the Voter.com-Battleground
2000 Poll, which was released Thursday and showed Gore trailing
Bush by 6 percentage points in a national survey of 1,000 likely
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters rarely measure the degree to which presidential
campaigns are a personality contest. But such contests ``always
involve personality,'' said former GOP strategist Jack Pitney, now
a political science professor at Claremont McKenna College in
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the Cold War, the voters applied an exacting
personality test: Can we trust this person with the Bomb?'' said
Pitney. ``Now the test is different: Can we stand this person on TV
every day for the next four years? In other words, do we reach for
the clicker when his face pops on the screen? So far, Gore is
flunking the clicker test.''
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup poll released this week showed that 44 percent of
respondents viewed Gore unfavorably, the highest reading since he
became a candidate for president. Bush's unfavorable rating was 32
percent, about where it has been since his rocky primary showings
in February.
</P>
<P>
   In Gallup's polling since February 1999, Gore's unfavorable
ratings have been consistently near 40 percent, a level once
regarded as death to a campaign. His unfavorable ratings
consistently exceed the job disapproval ratings of President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The peak in Gore's unfavorable ratings come at the same time
Bush is widening his advantage in national preference surveys.
</P>
<P>
   A Los Angeles Times poll this week showing the Texas governor
leading Gore 51 percent to 43 percent among registered voters
nationwide. In the Battleground 2000 poll, Bush leads Gore 48
percent to 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   These findings came even though the vice president is promoting
the best national economy since World War II, has 23 years of
political experience and is waging a relentless assault on Bush
proposals, repeatedly describing them as ``risky' or ``reckless''
or ``arrogant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any poll is just a snapshot, and none of them mean very much
with the election still six months away,'' Doug Hattaway, Gore's
campaign spokesman in Nashville, said in response to the Gallup
poll.
</P>
<P>
   Another source of comfort for the Gore campaign is that most of
the people who dislike Gore are the same people who disapprove of
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's highest unfavorable rating, 49 percent, in the
Battleground 2000 poll comes from white Southerners, a core
Republican constituency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kind of thing that can cause panic in a campaign, but
it shouldn't,'' said Craig Smith, who was Gore's campaign manager
before the shake-up that moved the campaign to Nashville last year.
``We're at a stage now where voters aren't paying much attention.
But when they were, back during the early primaries, Gore and Bush
were tied in the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the Gallup poll in February, the favorable and
unfavorable ratings of Gore and Bush were virtually the same.
</P>
<P>
   But among undecided voters, Gore is viewed more favorably than
Bush, according to the Battleground 2000 poll _ ``a very big
surprise and a very important factor for Democratic fortunes,''
said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, who conducts the
Battleground 2000 poll with Goeas.
</P>
<P>
   That poll shows 44 percent of those voters have a favorable
opinion of the vice president, while 34 percent are unfavorable.
Bush was viewed favorably by 36 percent, while 39 percent had an
unfavorable opinion.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   It is clear, however, from a variety of polls that Gore is not
making what Pew Research Center Director Andrew Kohut describes as
``a chemical connection'' with voters.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Kohut allows poll respondents to give their own
one-word description of candidates. Last September and again in
March, the most frequent word to describe Gore was ``boring.''
Bush, on the other hand, was most often described as ``good'' or
``okay.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in Pew's March poll, the quality voters least liked
about Gore was his personality.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has a reputation as a natural back-slapping
politician, his personality also was the quality voters least liked
about him in the Pew polls. And that dislike has grown: last
October, 19 percent listed his personality as his least likeable
characteristic, but in March poll, 33 percent did.
</P>
<P>
   In the Los Angeles Times poll, Gore's personality was the third
most important characteristic cited by his supporters. Most cited
was experience, 28 percent, and political philosophy, 16 percent,
with 15 percent citing personality. Bush's personality placed third
among his supporters, too. It was cited by 16 percent, trailing
trustworthiness, 29 percent, and political philosophy, 21 percent.

NEW ORLEANS: to break in. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   And yes, some of the development worries New Orleans purists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people here periodically wonder if New
Orleans is in danger of becoming kind of a clone of Houston, but I
rather doubt that will happen for a couple of reasons, the main one
being that the extent of well-preserved 19th-century and older
architecture really mitigates against the endless horizontal sprawl
of other big cities, '' says New Orleans writer Jason Berry, who
with photographer Philip Gould has written ``Louisiana Faces:
Images From a Renaissance.'' The book, celebrating the state's
music, art and culture, will be published by LSU Press this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is culturally one of the richest cities in the world ...
and I think on the whole, New Orleans is a place that has a grasp
on its past. It really markets its history commercially.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Stroll along the French Quarter streets, and you can overhear
snippets of the guides' spiels as they lead groups on walking tours
or drive by in horse-drawn carriages, weaving a seamless blend of
history and modern-day lore, the factual and the mythic.
</P>
<P>
   ``On your left, the restaurant of the famous Cajun chef, Paul
Prudhomme ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Later on, we'll tell you where you can see one of the homes of
Anne Rice, whose vampire books were set in New Orleans ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are coming up on Jackson Square, where there is always a
party ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Marie Laveau may have been known as a famous voodoo priestess,
but her real occupation was a hairdresser ...''
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans is like that _ history is embedded throughout its
core, the new unable to fully separate itself from the old. Even
the newest buildings and businesses pay homage to the city's past.
</P>
<P>
   At the International House, a stylish boutique hotel opened in
1998 on the edge of the French Quarter, the bellhops may wear
Italian-style suits, the rooms may be decorated in minimalist beige
and the in-house restaurant may be a sleek Asian operation called
Lemon Grass. But the hotel also has hung portraits of New Orleans
jazz greats, stocked its in-room CD players with albums by favorite
sons like Wynton Marsalis and Dr. John, and arranged for a local
voodoo priestess to conduct love-spell ceremonies for guests upon
request.
</P>
<P>
   The anticipated Ogden Museum of Southern Art and the National
D-Day Museum both chose to restore existing historic buildings in
the city's warehouse district. The Ritz Carlton Hotel is doing a
multimillion-dollar renovation on the site of the long-gone but
still beloved Maison-Blanche department store on Canal Street.
</P>
<P>
   Even Jazzland, the 140-acre theme park set to open May 20 on a
site 20 minutes from downtown, has taken its thematic cues from the
city. Sections of the park are called Mardi Gras, Cajun Country and
Pontchartrain Beach. There will be daily Mardi Gras parades and
live zydeco and jazz performances. At the dining pavilions, guests
will chow down on jambalaya, oyster po-boys and beignets.
</P>
<P>
   And new building aside, there are many pockets of New Orleans in
which it's impossible to tell if anything has changed for 10 years
_ or 100.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a reason you can come back to this city, and it never
seems to change,'' says my tour guide on the otherwise eminently
skippable New Orleans vampire tour, explaining the stringent zoning
and preservation laws in the Quarter that require buildings to be
maintained in a historically accurate fashion.
</P>
<P>
   For example, ``If something was originally a yellow building
when it was built, it's always going to be yellow.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   So, even though I spend the weekend trying to hit as many new
spots as possible, I find myself feeling on familiar ground _
partly because the Quarter never changes that much, partly because
there are old favorites I just couldn't resist.
</P>
<P>
   I don't ride the streetcar to the Garden District, but I sit for
an hour in Jackson Square, listening to a skilled pickup band of
street musicians rip through ``Sweet Georgia Brown'' and a string
of Dixieland tunes, then eavesdropping on the psychics and palm
readers earnestly talking to shorts-wearing tourists.
</P>
<P>
   I don't visit the Audubon Park Zoo, but I spend a late morning
at the Aquarium of the Americas, as fascinated by old exhibits (the
penguins, the sharks) as the new attractions (tiny sea horses,
cheerful California sea otters.)
</P>
<P>
   I don't eat brunch at Commander's Palace or beignets at Cafe du
Monde (partly because the line even at 10 a.m. spilled dangerously
into Decatur Street), but I can't resist a quick dinner at Paul
Prudhomme's K-Paul's, where the fried oyster Caesar salad and the
praline creme brulee are worth sitting at the bar and being served
by a harried bartender.
</P>
<P>
   Then, during my last few hours in town, a stranger seems to read
my mind. After hours of shopping and walking, and searching
unsuccessfully for a casual restaurant open for lunch on Easter
Sunday, I lobby for a hot dog, telling my companion plaintively,
``You can't go home without eating a Lucky Dog.''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't think the vendor heard me, but he smiled when he handed
over my hot dog, dripping with chili, onions and mustard.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, you can't,'' he said, giving me a couple of extra napkins
for good measure. ``That's right. There's some things you just
gotta do in New Orleans.''

FATHER OF INTERNET SLAYING SUSPECT SAYS SON HAD `TERRIBLE RAGE' 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIMBERON, N.M. _ The man accused of killing a Texas A&AMP;M
University student last month after &UR;  &LR; posing as a woman on the
Internet has ``a terrible rage problem,'' chronic medical ailments
and sexuality issues, his father said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lockwood said his 31-year-old son, Kenny Wayne Lockwood,
probably succumbed to anger when he fatally shot Kerry Jason
Kujawa, 20, of Richmond, Texas. The elder Lockwood believes the
shooting took place in the living room of the family home in San
Antonio, where the suspect lived with his mother.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-hour interview, Lockwood, 65, described his son as a
sickly boy with a violent temper, growing up in the shadow of two
``overachieving'' older brothers. Once, Kenny attempted suicide,
his father said. Although he has a nursing degree, his battles with
pancreatitis and related illnesses have prevented him from working
for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he occupied himself on the Internet, sometimes
pretending to be a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here he was posing as a blond pre-law (female) student and
this guy, a student, showed up at the house and something
happened,'' the father said. ``Whatever happened _ whoever said
what to whom, or whatever _ who knows?
</P>
<P>
   ``What he's done is a horrible, horrible thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that on the day of the killing in early April, his
estranged wife, Dina, was out of town. Police believe Kujawa went
to the Lockwood home looking for the mysterious young woman he knew
as ``Kelly'' from Internet conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators theorize that Kujawa may have been killed because
he discovered Kenny Lockwood was posing as ``Kelly'' _ the name of
Kenny's only romantic interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny has a terrible rage problem,'' his father said. ``We've
seen it through the years.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Lockwood said he and his son have an ``aloof'' relationship,
and that has been especially true of the last five years while the
father has been living alone in the Sacramento Mountains of
southern New Mexico. He said they haven't spoken for at least six
months. Lockwood returned to San Antonio for a couple of days last
week and said he wanted to visit his son in jail in San Marcos. But
he missed the jail's visiting day.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lockwood, an Army retiree and former commander of the
defunct Bexar County Volunteer Militia, an anti-government
survivalist group, spoke dispassionately about his son during an
interview Monday in his Spartan, one-room cabin. Lockwood said he's
inclined to believe his son committed the crime _ not because he
gave what police called a ``full confession,'' but because of
physical evidence and computer records linking him to the fatal
rendezvous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was right in the living room. They took out a hunk of
carpet as evidence,'' Lockwood said. He said that after the arrest,
his two older sons used family phone records to verify that their
younger brother had talked to the victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boys sat down with telephone records and a calendar and
put it together themselves. He left a trail a mile wide. If the
kids could get it, you know what Big Brother's got,'' the father
said.
</P>
<P>
   And with a tinge of disbelief and disappointment in his voice,
Lockwood noted, ``he dumped the body on a friend's ranch'' near
Dripping Springs, Texas. The longtime friend was a former neighbor
in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Because the body was found in Hays County, the murder charge was
filed there and the investigation is being led by Sheriff Don
Montague. His investigators have not disclosed where they believe
the slaying occurred and have divulged few other details.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest warrant issued for Lockwood said Kujawa, an
engineering student, left his dorm at A&AMP;M for San Antonio on April
7 to finally meet ``Kelly,'' the screen name for the person he had
met in an Aggie chat room on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Lockwood was seen in Kujawa's dorm room
operating his computer. Lockwood's image was captured by a security
camera at the College Station, Texas, airport, where Kujawa's
bloodstained car was parked.
</P>
<P>
   Between Kujawa's disappearance April 7 and the discovery of his
body on April 19, police said Kujawa's parents in Richmond received
reassuring messages saying he was still with ``Kelly.'' Meanwhile,
others who knew ``Kelly'' from the chat room said those messages
continued as late as April 21. The final messages claimed Kelly and
Kujawa were engaged and headed to Richmond on Easter weekend to
meet his family.
</P>
<P>
   Lockwood said his son's use of that identity was intriguing
because that was the name of his only significant romantic
interest, when he was a student at John Marshall High School in San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   After his son's arrest, Lockwood said, investigators called him
to discuss the case and a gun possibly used in the slaying. Police
said they believed a .22-caliber handgun was used, but the father
said such a gun had been stolen. He believes a .22-caliber rifle, a
12th birthday present to his son, may have been involved.
</P>
<P>
   Lockwood said his two older sons, one of whom is an A&AMP;M
graduate, told him that the intense Internet relationship with
Kujawa wasn't Kenny Lockwood's first such entanglement. They were
referring to the claim of another A&AMP;M student, Scott Schneider, who
said he met Lockwood at A&AMP;M six months earlier, when he posed as
``Isaac,'' the younger brother of Kelly. The ruse was unsuccessful,
however, because Schneider didn't believe the mature visitor was
the teen-age sibling who Kelly said would be coming in her stead.

 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of Ben Browder
in a scene from ``Farscape.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Ben Browder may as well be in a black hole.
 &HT;    The actor stars as Captain John Crichton on the Sci-Fi Channel's
inventive, visually stunning and increasingly popular series
``Farscape.'' But the show films in Australia, far, far away from
its devoted fan base, the newspaper and magazine raves, and the
cable network's steadily increasing advertising revenues.
 &HT;    ``The show hasn't even premiered here in Australia,'' Browder
says by cellular telephone while in a car on his way to the
``Farscape'' set. ``So my contact with reaction to it is via the
Internet. The response there is astounding.
 &HT;    ``It's just gratifying and a little overwhelming to know that
people have taken to the show the way they have,'' he says. ``Am I
surprised by it? Yeah, part of me is very surprised, but you go
into anything hoping people will like what you do.
 &HT;    ``I'm pleased that people see as much in `Farscape' as we try to
put into it.''
 &HT;    Actually, Browder says, being so far from the hype benefits the
show. It keeps the cast and crew focused on the task at hand, and
also provides a sense of freedom.
 &HT;    ``We're just doing the show, trying to tell good stories, and we
haven't had to deal with a lot of the extraneous stuff that can
possibly come into play,'' the Memphis-born, Charlotte-raised actor
says. ``Nobody's approached me on the street and said, `John, I
can't believe you did that to Aeryn!'
 &HT;    ``I haven't had anyone reprimanding me to my face for the things
that John has done,'' he says cheerfully. ``So that has been pretty
good, actually.''
 &HT;    Crichton, for those not in the loop, is a modern-day astronaut
who finds himself tossed across countless galaxies, smack-dab into
the middle of a raging war. To survive, he joins up with a batch of
renegades that includes a blue priestess (Virginia Hey), an
imposing warrior (Anthony Simcoe), a quirky trollop (Gigi Edgley),
a disenfranchised royal _ a convincing animatronic puppet from Jim
Henson's Creature Shop _ and the aforementioned Aeryn Sun (Claudia
Black), a potential Crichton love interest. They spend most of
their time aboard a sentient ship called Moya.
 &HT;    As the first season ended, the villainous, black-clad Scorpius
(Wayne Pygram) was gleefully torturing Crichton in an ``Alien Meets
Brazil''-style electric chair. Now, early in the second season,
Crichton and company are together again and back on the run.
 &HT;    ``I think it was an interesting journey that was mapped out for
season one,'' Browder says. ``He started off being unable to open a
door, and then reached a level of confidence and competence that
felt right to me. Then he seemed to get stuck, until we saw him in
Scorpius' chair. That seemed to turn him around, and made him into
something else.
 &HT;    ``A lot of season two for Crichton has been his dealing with the
problems of going native,'' he adds. ``It's not an easy journey for
him, and I don't think it should be. He still has a lot of
difficulties. Despite th fact that he's more comfortable in his
surroundings and with the people on Moya, it's still a very
dangerous and turbulent universe for him.''
 &HT;    Life for Browder isn't nearly as tumultuous. He's keen on
Australia, and remarks that his kids even speak with Aussie accents
these days. And, as further proof that his show has fully captured
the imaginations of sci-fi fans, a line of ``Farscape'' action
figures is in the offing.
 &HT;    ``It's something we can all look forward to,'' Browder says,
tongue firmly in cheek. ``It's got to be one of the scariest things
going, especially when you consider what you did to your own action
figures.
 &HT;    ``All I can think of is Rover chewing off John Crichton's legs
and people burning him in effigy and kids putting him through
fights he'll undoubtedly lose again and again,'' he says, laughing.
``It's kind of a scary proposition.''

<P>
   ``On the Internet, you can be anyone you want to be. He was
impersonating two different people,'' Lockwood said. Yet, chat-room
participants said Lockwood had a third cyber identity, sometimes
claiming to be ``Kate,'' the little sister of Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Lockwood said his son picked up some of his computer savvy from
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very good, and I've always had a computer there since the
early days,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lockwood said that after he retired from the Army, he
worked for a San Antonio computer company; wrote a book on computer
viruses; lectured about computers for the Air Force and helped
start a business called Computers Made Simple. In New Mexico,
Lockwood writes for a local newspaper and publishes a map of the
tiny unincorporated resort community where he lives.
</P>
<P>
   Lockwood said his son had a normal boyhood until he reached his
teen years, when medical woes disrupted schooling and turned the
sickly and homebound son emotionally inward. Kenny had friends,
Lockwood said, but he spent much of his time alone _ reading,
studying aviation and assembling model airplanes. About 60 models
decorated his room when police searched it, Lockwood said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny was a wonderful kid. We used to go camping together
almost every weekend. In those days, the Lockwood family was a real
fun family because we were doing all these outdoor things
together,'' Lockwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the son's health precluded such outings, the father
said, recalling that Kenny was subject to nausea, swelling and
eventually diabetes. In one five-year period, he was hospitalized
for three years, he said. Over time, the son amassed ``millions and
millions'' of dollars in medical expenses, paid for either by the
military or Social Security, Lockwood said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd spent a long time in a body cast. When he went into the
hospital all &UR;  &LR; bloated up, &UR;  &LR; they checked him for AIDS and drugs,
hepatitis. But he had pancreatitis,'' Lockwood said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got very bad, and they removed part of his pancreas and his
spleen,'' he said. Later, his gallbladder and part of his stomach
were removed, the father said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had nothing left. He had all those huge scars,'' Lockwood
continued. ``Between that and these anger attacks, he was a pretty
mixed-up kid.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating in 1986 from high school, where the yearbook
shows he was in ROTC and the oceanography club, Kenny Lockwood
flipped burgers at a fast-food restaurant before getting a late
start on college courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``To Kenny's credit, while he was going through all this hell,
he went on and got a nursing degree. And when he got his diploma,
the dean walked out and presented his diploma and all those people
(in the audience) went crazy,'' Lockwood recalled.
</P>
<P>
   By now in his mid-20s, Kenny Lockwood didn't pursue a nursing
career, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't work. No intestines left. Very weak all the time.
He couldn't last more than a couple of hours. He just kept having
problems,'' said his father.
</P>
<P>
   For the past four or five years, while the father lived alone in
New Mexico, the son was passing time at home, supported by a Social
Security disability check of about $600 a month. Lockwood said he
and his wife of 35 years, who are informally separated, cannot
afford to hire an attorney for their son, who is being held in lieu
of $500,000 bond; he assumes his son will have one appointed by the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's what I used to pay those big taxes for,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockwood speculated that the six-hour interview his son had with
police before his arrest on April 27 &UR;  &LR; may be challenged because
Lockwood was hospitalized and heavily medicated when the ``full
confession'' was made.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they found the body, shortly thereafter, he went into one
of these convulsions and they had to take him to the hospital. If
they doped him up ... they didn't get a confession from him,''
Lockwood said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would not hesitate to speak up in court on his son's
behalf. ``Would I get up and talk to the judge? Certainly. He's a
good kid, but something snapped in him. If you snap for a couple of
seconds, do you die for it? Well, maybe yes, maybe no.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that his son has no criminal record could work in his
favor. However, Lockwood recalled that about 10 years ago, his son
was arrested in San Antonio for ``trying to cash a check on our
account.'' The mother and police decided ``this kid's got problems
enough without going to jail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Equally troubling was an incident several years earlier that
didn't involve police, Lockwood said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was living under the shadow of two very overachieving
brothers,'' said Lockwood, referring to his son John, by a previous
marriage, and Mike Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``John was at the time the most decorated cadet that high school
had ever had, and Kenny stole his saber from him. He hid it in his
room. That doesn't sound like much, but that's a horrible thing.
That's like stealing an Aggie's boots,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Lockwood often worried his family by reacting angrily when
things didn't go his way, the father said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could never tell what would set him off. When he was in
grade school, he came home one day and tossed a toy truck through
the window. He'd always afterward be so apologetic. He'd mean it.
It would just pass. Like a switch, off and on,'' Lockwood said.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers claimed they once prevented Kenny Lockwood from
committing suicide, the father said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so mad at me that he stuck a shotgun into his mouth,
and they had to talk him out of it,'' Lockwood said.
</P>
<P>
   The angry streak also surfaced when the parents questioned their
then-teen-age son about his friend ``Kelly,'' and years later, when
the mother asked him if he were homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been some suspicion in our family, but I've never
pushed it. I remember one time Mama did ask him, and he flew into
one of these rages that you wouldn't believe,'' Lockwood said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny and Mike Jr. and I have talked, `Is he gay or isn't
he?''' the father said, adding that the suspicions were based on
comments Kenny Lockwood made and videotapes he owned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the videotapes I found were kind of raunchy and most
of them had sort of gay themes, but he had normal ones in there,
too,'' Lockwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockwood said his son wasn't analyzed for psychological
problems, but he discounted any suggestion his son might have
multiple personalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny would sometimes get wrapped up in his own little lies,
and they would grow and grow. Remember, on the Internet, you can be
anyone you want to be, and I think he got a little carried away
with being people that he wishes he was. That's the way I look at
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Mike Lockwood, one of the biggest concerns is whether his
son will get adequate medical care behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a worry. He's going in there with all these pieces
missing,'' Lockwood said. ``I'm afraid that he's not going to
last.''
</P>
<P>
   Enduring his son's prosecution, and perhaps facing Kujawa's
parents, is another worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have thought about writing to his parents,'' Lockwood said,
``but Lord knows, I don't know what to say. I don't know how to
start it.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines _ Appearing nervous behind a pair of dark
glasses, a young computer student told reporters Thursday that ``it
is possible'' that he released a destructive virus that has
crippled computer programs around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The student, Onel de Guzman, 23, did not quite admit that he
created the ``I love you'' virus that recently spread rapidly
through e-mail systems in at least 20 countries.
</P>
<P>
   But when he was asked whether he might have accidentally
released the virus, he replied, ``It is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   De Guzman, who lives in an apartment that has been identified by
officials as the source of the virus, was being sought by
authorities, although they have not officially named him as a
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion focused on him when it was learned that he had
submitted a thesis proposal to his computer college in February
that contained information similar to that used to create the
virus.
</P>
<P>
   The growing indications that the program was launched in this
low-tech country, possibly with skills acquired at the college, has
made its author not only a potential criminal but also, on the
campus and in the press, a bit of a local hero.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Thursday how he felt about the damage caused by the virus,
de Guzman said, ``Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he was not an Internet fanatic and that he and his
friends had only been trying to create what he called ``a gimmick''
_ a term used among young people here for an event that is exciting
and fun.
</P>
<P>
   Standing beside him, his lawyer, Rolando Quimbo, said, ``He is
not really aware that the act imputed to him was done by him.''
</P>
<P>
   These comments reinforced a growing sense here that one of the
most virulent computer viruses ever known was not a premeditated
act of sabotage but could have been a prank that later raced out of
control.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at AMA Computer College, where de Guzman is a student,
said Wednesday that they believed that he might have intended to
steal passwords and Internet access rather than cause tens of
millions of dollars of damage to computer systems around the world.
</P>
<P>
   After de Guzman surfaced late Thursday afternoon, the
authorities made no immediate move to take him into custody.
</P>
<P>
   The lead investigator at the National Bureau of Investigation,
the top law enforcement agency in the Philippines, Nelson
Bartolome, said Thursday that the creators of the virus ``did not
know it was criminal. Perhaps it was just a prank.''
</P>
<P>
   If this is so, one analyst here said, the episode illustrates
the vulnerability of computer systems not only to sophisticated
vandals but to relatively crude and even unintended acts of
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you need very, very sophisticated programming
language to create viruses, in the same way that you don't need
very, very sophisticated weapons to wreak havoc on a society,''
said Randy David, a Filipino sociologist who has studied the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   De Guzman's thesis proposal, which was rejected by his college
because of its criminal implications, described a plan to ``steal
and retrieve Internet accounts of the victim's computer'' in order
to gain free access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the things the virus did, while also moving
through e-mail systems like a poisoned chain letter, paralyzing the
accounts of recipients who opened an attachment titled ``I love
you.'' It was a hybrid of computer programs known as viruses and
worms.
</P>
<P>
   The program's apparent Philippine authorship has aroused a burst
of perverse pride in a country where computers are still a
futuristic technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, the Filipino can!'' cheered an editorial in The Manila
Standard Thursday under the headline, ``The country's first
world-class hacker.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a country of nearly 80 million people where only 200,000
computers were sold last year. It is a country with one of the
world's highest literacy rates, where only 5 percent of public
school students have access to computers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the National Bureau of Investigation, the nation's top law
enforcement body, which is charged with prosecuting the creator of
the virus, criminal files are still kept in big metal cabinets
rather than on computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were clueless,'' said Chin Wong, editor of Computer
World, a twice-monthly magazine here, speaking of the
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its low level of computerization, the Philippines
itself was not among the nations badly affected by the virus. Until
now, it has never seen the need to write any laws against computer
crime. It will take some legal creativity to prove that the creator
of the virus committed a crime.
</P>
<P>
   So Art A. Borjal, a columnist in The Philippine Star, may have
felt justified in sounding jubilant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, here is a Filipino genius who has put the Philippines on
the world map,'' he wrote Thursday, ``and who has proven that the
Filipino has the creativity and ingenuity to turn, for better or
for worse, the world upside down.''
</P>
<P>
   He blamed developed nations for creating a vulnerable computer
technology and said the home-grown virus is something that will
``make foreigners look at Filipinos with hidden envy.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the mood Thursday on de Guzman's campus, one of many
small, drab branches of the 10,000-student college that is known
for mass producing computer journeymen rather than sophisticated
programmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine, they were able to penetrate the Pentagon?''
said a computer engineering student who declined to give his name.
``Even though the Philippines is a Third World country, even though
we're behind in technology, they were able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   He was speaking of de Guzman and a second student, Michael Buen,
who school officials said Wednesday may have collaborated with de
Guzman in creating the virus.
</P>
<P>
   De Guzman denied to reporters Thursday that Buen was involved.
But de Guzman's lawyer, Quimbo, said that ``knowledge of the
contents'' of the thesis proposal ``was not limited to Onel.''
</P>
<P>
   After a computer in de Guzman's apartment was identified _ with
the help of the U.S. FBI _ as the source of the virus, Philippine
authorities obtained a warrant for the arrest of two of the
residents.
</P>
<P>
   They arrested one man, Reomel Ramones, a bank employee, on
Monday and held him overnight. They also issued a subpoena for his
friend, Irene de Guzman, who also works in a bank and who is Onel
de Guzman's older sister. She appeared with him at the news
conference Thursday, also wearing a pair of dark glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the country's low technological level, computer colleges
have proliferated in recent years, in large part to serve foreign
companies that are based either here or abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Computer technicians are the latest wave in a long-standing
national industry _ the export of labor _ that has traditionally
involved construction workers, seamen, entertainers, nurses and
domestic help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computer training is really a ticket for a lot of
lower-middle-class families to have their children work abroad,''
said David Celdran, a local journalist who reports on computers and
information technology.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign workers in all fields send home as much as $6 billion a
year, the nation's leading source of foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``The skills they acquire at schools like AMA are really the
basic skills _ computer literacy, basic programming, electronics,
putting together motherboards, hardware, computer repair _ rather
than sophisticated computer engineering or programming skills,''
Celdran said.
</P>
<P>
   All the more reason for quiet pride on de Guzman's campus
Thursday, where faculty members insisted that they did not condone
computer crime although the students seemed fascinated.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he did was wrong, but amazing,'' said one of them. ``This
is technology that began in the United States, and yet we were able
to manipulate it.''

 A SURPRISED `WILD PARTY'; ANOTHER LIFE FOR `CATS'; `I'M A WHAT?';
ALONG THE WAY By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The unexpectedly strong showing of the Public
Theater's production of ``The Wild Party'' in the Tony Award
nominations _ the show landed seven _ has apparently lifted the
fortunes of that struggling musical enough to persuade its
producers to run at least through the Tonys.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which opened to mixed reviews at the Virginia Theater
on April 13, received nominations for best musical, score, book and
lighting, as well as for the acting of its three leads: Mandy
Patinkin, Toni Collette and Eartha Kitt.
</P>
<P>
   And while the nominations provided a much-needed morale lift,
they did not provide a huge lift in sales; the show did about
$40,000 in business on Tuesday and Wednesday. Still, it has shown
stronger sales since its early days _ perhaps because of heavy
advertising _ and the producers believe it may be building
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   So now, the producers have decided to stick with the show
through the awards on June 4. They hope the national television
exposure and some winners generate sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are looking up,'' said Kenneth Lerer, chairman of the
Public Theater's board. ``We are moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to keep ``Wild Party'' alive probably means
``Macbeth,'' starring Kelsey Grammer and due on Broadway on June 8,
will end up at a Shubert theater. Recent advertisements for that
show have been cagey about its eventual home, saying it would play
at ``a Jujamcyn theater,'' but it is an open secret that the
production has been eyeing the Virginia. But with ``The Wild
Party'' staying open, Jujamcyn doesn't appear to have a theater
available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Macbeth'' producers aren't commenting on their plans, but
because of advertising deadlines and technical questions, they will
soon need to know where they're playing. The closing of ``Amadeus''
on Sunday means the Music Box, owned by the Shubert Organization,
would be available. The production has been designed for the
Virginia but could fit in the smaller Music Box. The production
could be lucrative for the Shuberts; it has sold well in its
pre-Broadway run in Boston, and Grammer is expected to be a major
draw in New York, too.
</P>
<P>
   Rocco Landesman, the president of Jujamcyn, and Wolfe have a
long working relationship, which has included Wolfe's productions
of ``Angels in America'' and ``Jelly's Last Jam.''
</P>
<P>
   Box-office figures for ``The Wild Party'' have been at about 50
percent of capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the small financial bump, the number of nominations is
seen by members of the production team as a vindication for a show
that has had its share of detractors. Oddly enough, the other
``Wild Party,'' produced by the Manhattan Theater Club, also found
a degree of redemption in the 13 nominations it received for Drama
Desk awards.
</P>
<P>
   Another Life for `Cats'
</P>
<P>
   You knew it was going happen.
</P>
<P>
   The producers of ``Cats,'' scheduled to close on June 25,
announced Thursday that the show would extend 11 more weeks in
response to extraordinary demand for tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Sales for ``Cats,'' the longest-running musical in Broadway
history, have been hot since word came in February that the show,
which has played at the Winter Garden Theater since 1982, would
finally meow for the last time. The announcement made front pages
coast to coast, and the race for tickets was on. Last week ``Cats''
had the sixth highest grosses on Broadway, with sales of $635,639.
</P>
<P>
   `I'm a What?'
</P>
<P>
   It was 6:30 a.m., Pacific Daylight Time, on Monday when Daniel
Davis' phone rang. He awoke, and some woman started screaming at
him manically, telling him that he had just won a Tony, or was a
Tony, or could buy a Tony, or something.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even realize what was happening,'' Davis said. ``I
thought, `Who is this insane woman?'''
</P>
<P>
   The woman, it turned out, was a press agent from
Boneau/Bryan-Brown, the agency that had handled ``Wrong Mountain,''
the short-lived David Hirson play in which Davis had played a
grandiose theater director. (The play, which was not loved by
critics, closed on Feb. 5 after 28 performances.) The press agent
was screaming about Davis' unlikely, but wildly applauded, Tony
nomination for best featured performance in a play. It is his first
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   How did Davis, who is currently between jobs, react to the news?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just stunned beyond belief,'' he said. ``I ran up about
a $2,000 phone bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, says Davis, who played Niles the butler on the
sitcom ``The Nanny'' for six years, he has had several calls from
directors wondering about his availability. He also said the
nomination was something of a vindication for a play he felt was
unfairly dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a joy because this feels like it comes from other
actors and people who do the work,'' he said. ``It just feels so
wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the Way
</P>
<P>
   _ The critically acclaimed revival of ``Jitney,'' by August
Wilson, has been extended until July 16 at Second Stage, and there
is talk of a further extension. This week, the play won the New
York Drama Critics award for best play. Other winners included the
musical ``James Joyce's `The Dead,''' which opens in Los Angeles in
July, and ``Copenhagen,'' named best foreign play.
</P>
<P>
   _ The creators of ``How to Be a Red Hot Shakespearean Lover,'' a
lighthearted look at classic romancing techniques, must be on to
something. Recently the male half of the two-person cast, Greg
Steinbruner, proposed to the female half, Eve Hartmann. The show
finishes a run this weekend at the St. Marks Theater; a wedding is
planned for next year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bronson Pinchot, Keith David and Randy Danson head the cast of
Shakespeare's ``Winter's Tale,'' beginning at the Delacorte Theater
in Central Park on June 21.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Enter the Guardsman,'' now in previews at the Vineyard
Theater, has pushed its opening from May 18 to May 21. The reason?
``The Laramie Project,'' Moises Kaufman's docudrama, is scheduled
to open on May 18 at the Union Square Theater, around the corner
from the Vineyard.

&HT;     49ERS CLOUDED WITH UNCERTAINTY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ In the spring of their rebuilding, the San
Francisco 49ers are a team badly in need of resolution, but
wherever they look all they see is an image just out of focus.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Garrison Hearst returned from Seattle on Tuesday
after surgery there to increase blood flow in his troublesome left
ankle. He might be able to play by October.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Steve Young popped in for a visit with coach Steve
Mariucci before flying to Phoenix to be with his bride, Barbara. He
is still deciding whether he wants to play again.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Jerry Rice met with general manager Bill Walsh on
Monday about his possible return to the 49ers, contingent upon a
salary cap-friendly contract being worked out.
</P>
<P>
   While Hearst's most recent surgery puts his return in doubt, the
49ers should know where they stand with Young and Rice by early
June. The financial effect of roster moves made after June 1 is
deferred until 2001, which is why transactions occur at this time.
</P>
<P>
   If the 49ers decide to part ways with either Young or Rice, they
would not take a hit to their salary cap for this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``June 1 is a big date for us,'' Walsh said. ``It's important we
be able to make firm plans soon. If Steve returns, signing another
quarterback is not a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   That would impact Rick Mirer, whom the 49ers are considering
signing in June if Young decides not to return. A decision can't
come soon enough for Mariucci, who fiddles while Young turns the
issue over and over in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's being tugged in different directions,'' Mariucci said.
``One tug is he has a real desire to play. Then another tug is if
going in a different direction makes sense. Another tug is maybe
play one more year with Jerry. He really hasn't settled on one
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Young may be swayed by how good he feels after not playing for
nearly 10 months, Mariucci said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does feel good,'' the coach said. ``It's come down to Steve
making a decision to play or not. He feels the risks are minimal.
He just has to decide if he wants to play again.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice, meanwhile, has made his desire to return to the 49ers
abundantly clear. His agent, Jim Steiner, is trying to work out a
one- or two-year contract at considerably less than the $5.49
million salary cap figure Rice is scheduled to carry into this
season. Of that amount, $3.95 million is in salary; the rest is
accounted for by his prorated signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh is hopeful an agreement can be reached, but cautioned,
``Until it's signed, it's not signed.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Hearst, his second surgery on the ankle will further
extend his already 16-month rehabilitation from the original injury
he sustained on Jan. 9, 1999. In the procedure Saturday in Seattle,
Dr. Pierce Scranton removed dead bone from Hearst's ankle and
inserted grafts taken from his knee to try to stimulate blood flow
and halt the onset of necrosis.
</P>
<P>
   According to the 49ers, no NFL player has had this type of
condition and returned to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels better, feels more hopeful,'' Walsh said.
``Obviously, it pushes us way back into the season. It's really up
in the air. We just don't know what the odds are (of his
returning).''
</P>
<P>
   For a team trying to rebuild, the 49ers need a clear vision of
where they are heading. Instead, the looking glass is clouded with
uncertainty.

ANDREW HILL: `DUSK'
</HEADLINE>
 By BEN RATLIFF  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pianist Andrew Hill has long been embraced by the jazz
underground, whose language of appreciation too often rests on
notions of musicians' being underserved, underrated or not having
the appropriate context for their genius to shine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dusk,'' Hill's first album in 10 years, should end his
marginal status: It connects him with some of the better young jazz
musicians working today and takes the full measure of Hill as a
composer better than one would have thought possible. It makes him
important again.
</P>
<P>
   What's nice about his current rehabilitation, which was helped
by players like the trumpeter Ron Horton and saxophonist Marty
Ehrlich, is that it wasn't brought about from the outside, by a
record company. Hill is imposing enough to attract disciples all by
himself, and that's what has happened in the last few years. (He
has been especially embraced by members of the Jazz Composers
Collective.) His pieces tend to strike the ear as discontinuous but
generally gain cohesion on further listening. His favorite pace,
playing all alone or in front of a steady rhythm section, is
wobbly; his legato sounds hesitant; his harmonies are influenced by
Thelonious Monk's tone-clashes; he likes to write in odd meters;
and his keyboard touch is self-consciously raw and unpolished.
</P>
<P>
   All this makes him unusual, but ``Dusk'' is better than just
unusual. Part of it has to do with the exactness of the horn
arrangements: The music is full of long, contrapuntal harmonized
lines that move around from major to minor, keeping the mood in
flux, and for the most part solos are used only as short segues to
the next chunk of writing. And part of it, of course, has to do
with a good rhythm section.
</P>
<P>
   Hill has recorded his share of opaque, incomprehensible music,
but ``Dusk'' brings him back into a clarity that's near the
territory of his greatest album, ``Point of Departure'' in 1964.

REBEL ADVANCE ON SIERRA LEONE'S CAPITAL IS REPULSED 
</HEADLINE>
   By NORIMITSU ONISHI   
 C.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ Forces loyal to the government appeared
to push back a rebel advance onto this capital city Thursday, but
fighting intensified and spread to other areas in the country.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition made up of United Nations peacekeepers, Sierra
Leonean soldiers and a militia known as Kamajors secured the road
leading to the town of Waterloo, about 18 miles southeast of the
capital. But heavy fighting took place about 10 miles east of
Waterloo, said David Wimhurst, the spokesman of the U.N. force.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, fighting around Waterloo drove thousands of
civilians to gather at Jui Junction, 10 miles from Freetown, as
they fled toward the capital. Thursday, many people were returning
to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   In the capital, pro-government forces tightened security on the
streets, mindful that infiltrators played a critical role last year
in the near-fall of Freetown. British paratroopers limited access
to the western part of the city, the site of the U.N. headquarters,
even setting up barbed-wire along the beach.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. peacekeepers operated checkpoints, alongside Sierra Leonean
soldiers, militiamen, and rifle-toting men of unknown affiliation;
they were dressed in T-shirts and flip-flops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every minute that goes by strengthens our resolve to bring
lasting peace in this country,'' said Prince Nicol, the spokesman
for Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma. In the rapidly shifting alliances
since last week, Koroma, is now supporting the government against
his former ally, Foday Sankoh, the leader of the Revolutionary
United Front. Koroma previously headed a short-lived junta that
toppled President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah in 1997; Kabbah now is
president again.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's fighting took place as the United Nations continued
to try to obtain the release of 500 hostages. The whereabouts of
Sankoh, who vanished after a deadly confrontation outside his house
Monday, were still unclear, Wimhurst said. But negotiations with
the Revolutionary United Front were being held through
intermediaries, including Liberia's president, Charles Taylor, a
former guerrilla who has long supported Sankoh.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Securing Freetown against an assault by the Revolutionary United
Front has become the priority of the U.N. force. But thousands of
U.N. peacekeepers remain deployed in large towns across the
country, some in rebel-held territory.
</P>
<P>
   In the northern town of Makeni, hundreds of Kenyan peacekeepers
who had been surrounded by rebels broke through to the north and
south. Most made it to friendly territory. But six were wounded,
three seriously, when they came under friendly fire by Sierra
Leonean soldiers who mistook them for rebels disguised in U.N.
uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Some rebels have apparently begun wearing uniforms that they
stripped from the 500 U.N. members who are being held hostage.
Others have been using the hostages' equipment, including 13
armored cars belonging to Zambian troops.
</P>
<P>
   In a town about 65 miles by highway from here called Port Loko,
the site of two abandoned disarmament camps, U.N. peacekeepers were
attacked overnight by rebels using armored cars, Wimhurst said. No
casualties were reported.
</P>
<P>
   But the heaviest battles occurred on the road east of Waterloo,
according to the United Nations. Jordanian and Nigerian
peacekeepers formed a heavy presence in the area, and three
Landrovers filled with elite SAS British troops were seen heading
east of Waterloo. The 850 British troops in Sierra Leone, who are
officially here to evacuate European nationals, have been under
intense pressure to play a more active role in peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerians, Indians, Kenyans, Jordanians, Zambians, Guineans and
Ghanaians make up the 8,700-member force in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Leonean army, which is said to number 5,000, was far
larger before the junta took power in 1997. At the time most
soldiers reportedly sided with Koroma against the government. In
the anarchy of Sierra Leone, many who were soldiers during the day
became rebels at night _ and came to be known as ``sobels.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Sierra Leone's peace agreement, rebellious soldiers
fit to be rehabilitated were to be reintegrated into a new Sierra
Leonean army. But in the desperation that gripped the government in
recent days, the government effectively permitted Koroma to rally
his men against Sankoh's group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has not stopped them from doing what they are
doing,'' Septimus Kaikai, Kabbah's spokesman, said in an interview
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolutionary United Front and the Kamajor militia, which is
made up of traditional hunters who often provide security services
in West Africa, are each thought to total more than 15,000 members.

   AIDS-DRUGS (Paris) _ In a move that could change the face of
AIDS treatment in Africa and Asia, five major pharmaceutical
companies offered Thursday to negotiate deep cuts in the prices of
their drugs for poor nations plagued by the disease. The
announcement was made by the World Health Organization in Geneva,
and the companies were careful not to appear together to discuss
the offers. All were afraid of running afoul of American antitrust
laws, which prevent corporations not only from colluding to raise
prices, but from colluding to lower them. But even if the prices
drop steeply _ and cuts of 80 percent or more are being talked of _
no one expects an easy end to AIDS in the Third World. By Donald G.
McNeil Jr.

   LOS-ALAMOS-FIRE (Los Alamos, N.M.) _ A firestorm swept through
the abandoned streets of Los Alamos on Thursday, burning as many as
400 homes, some down to their foundations, while frustrated
firefighters braced for wind gusts up to 60 mph. All 11,000 people
in Los Alamos were evacuated, and on Thursday morning another 7,000
fled suburban White Rock, where many evacuees had once sought
safety. At the storied Los Alamos nuclear laboratory, for the first
time shut down by fire, flames singed a research building but it
did not ignite. Explosives and radioactive material were protected
in fireproof facilities, lab officials said. (Summary from wires)

   MILITARY-HARASS (Washington) _ Out of the blue, when they were
cooling down after their regular morning jog, a colonel was groped
by her male running partner, another colonel who forcefully tried
to embrace her; ``I pushed him back and said `no' and that was
it,'' she said. The woman, now one of the military's senior
officers and insists that her name not be revealed, did not report
this incident when it took place a few years ago. She said she
feared that both her reputation and her career could have been
ruined if she filed an official complaint. And even after the
vindication of a formal sexual harassment complaint filed against
filed by Lt. Gen. Claudia Kennedy against another general, the
senior officer who was accosted while jogging still believes she
did the right thing. But the Kennedy case has revived the question
of how pervasive sexual harassment remains in the military and how
such cases should be handled. By Elizabeth Becker.

   NY-GIULIANI-REACT (New York) _ Over sandwiches and keyboards
Thursday, around soda machines and bus stops, it seemed as if New
Yorkers were barely bothering with the news: the marital problems
of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and his wife, Donna Hanover. ``Come on,
we knew a long time ago this wasn't much of a marriage,'' said
Sidney Levitan, 89, a retired high school administrator. Instead _
in a world where divorce is common, where a presidential scandal
has inured people to accounts of infidelity and where talk shows
obliterate lines between public and private every morning _ the
questions seemed to be less about the breakup of a marriage and
more about how the the husband and the wife are conducting
themselves during that breakup. By Randy Kennedy.

   EGAN-PROFILE (Bridgeport, Conn.) _ As a seminary student in
Chicago, he was the only member of his class chosen to go to Rome
to finish his theology studies. As a young priest, he spent a mere
year in a parish before he was plucked to serve as an assistant to
the cardinal of Chicago. And later in the Vatican, he was one of
six experts in church law selected to spend mornings with Pope John
Paul II over breakfast, helping him review each word of the
proposed new Code of Canon Law. On Thursday, after a week of
unusually explicit leaks, the Vatican formally announced that
Bishop Edward Michael Egan of Bridgeport, Conn., had been chosen
the ninth archbishop of New York, to succeed Cardinal John
O'Connor, who died last week at the age of 80. By Laurie Goodstein.

in 1990 and is now one of the world's two biggest producers of
sport utility vehicles, said that it faced a ``dilemma'' in
continuing to sell the highly profitable vehicles despite what the
company acknowledged were serious safety and environmental
problems. In a ``corporate citizenship report'' issued at the
company's annual shareholders' meeting here, Ford Motor
acknowledged that sport utilities contribute more than cars to
global warming, are permitted higher tailpipe emissions, and pose
safety and visibility dangers for other motorists. Ford said that
it was making progress toward solutions and was even looking for
alternatives to the off-road vehicles, although continuing to
produce them. By Keith Bradsher.

Georgia. Surprisingly, these emigrants were using tools developed
700,000 years before, confounding the prevailing theory that it was
an advance in tool making that fueled the migration out of Africa.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In his sparsely furnished apartment perched high
above West End Avenue and dominated by a Steinway grand, the
pianist Robert Taub was poring over musical manuscripts one recent
afternoon, as he often does.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I learn a piece,'' Taub says, ``I ask myself, `Why am I
learning it?' And the answer is that I feel a lot about it and
think there's something about it that I can communicate. But then I
ask: `Why did the composer write it? What did it mean to him?' And
the best answers are in the sketches and the autograph scores,
where you can see what choices were made and why.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not impossible to interpret a piece of music from the
printed score alone, and often an artist has no choice. Still, the
printed score is the diagram of a result, whereas a manuscript
captures the shape of inspiration on the wing. That, ideally, is
what Taub wants to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``No editor will print a double negative,'' Taub declares by way
of illustration. The point arises apropos of Beethoven's Sonata No.
30 in E, which Taub will perform on May 19 in a rare piano recital
in the Coolidge Auditorium at the Library of Congress in
Washington. The library, not incidentally, owns the manuscript of
the sonata, as it does those of Haydn's Sonata in E flat (Hob.
XVI:52) and Milton Babbitt's ``Canonical Form,'' also on the
program.
</P>
<P>
   The double negative occurs in the finale of the Beethoven
sonata, which starts out as a conventional theme and variations but
after four clearly designated variations takes on a freer, more
adventurous character. The last bar of the theme appears in
published editions without either a ritardando or a pedal marking _
quite rightly, since Beethoven, having written them in ink, later
scratched them out in pencil, his customary implement for
registering second thoughts. He brought out the pencil again at the
end of the sonata, where the theme recurs in its original form.
Here, he decided on reflection, the ritardando and the pedaling
mark were in order, along with a new low E, for resonance.
</P>
<P>
   The reverse adjustments at the beginning and the end of the
movement point to the same conclusion: that the theme and the
opening variations are not modular segments. On the contrary, the
movement unfolds as a single trajectory, no pauses for breath along
the way.
</P>
<P>
   Like other pianists, Taub first learned the Beethoven from
printed scores; to the best of his knowledge (and he has not failed
to look), no facsimile of the manuscript exists. His path first led
him to the Library of Congress as he was preparing his 10-CD series
of the complete Beethoven piano sonatas for Vox Classics, a survey
as remarkable for the intellectual grasp of the material as for its
technical assurance and aura of poetic spontaneity.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was when I really began to realize what treasures
autograph scores are,'' he says. ``The immersion in the spiritual
world of the composer became so much more intense. Every printed
edition is sterile compared to an autograph score. The calligraphy
is imbued with the composer's emotion while rehearing the music in
the process of writing it down. Some of the Beethoven sonatas look
very neat. Others show evidence of greater struggle to find just
the right artistic statement. Some are very messy, but they give
you the sweep of the music.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, to an artist of Taub's turn of mind, the spacious
arrangement of an arpeggio of grace notes in the manuscript of the
E major Sonata gives a graphic image of the generous elasticity
with tempo Beethoven had in mind. The same little notes squashed
into minimum space in the printed score give priority to mere
thrift, sending a subliminal and potentially misleading message.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that a tempo marking that readers of the printed score
simply know as ``prestissimo'' (a rare term in Beethoven) is
expanded in pencil from the original ink ``presto'' likewise
strikes Taub as powerfully suggestive.
</P>
<P>
   The revelations of an autograph take many forms. The Haydn
sonata on Taub's program, the composer's last, written for the
sophisticated taste of audiences in London, combines the masterly
plan of a formal French garden with an English garden's lush,
casual exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   The printed editions do not obscure Haydn's unfettered,
apparently improvisatory panache, but the manuscript magnifies
those impressions by orders of magnitude. Like the famously
immaculate manuscripts of Mozart, it is pristine, fluent, devoid of
decorative flourish, essentially elegant rather than
demonstratively so.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the sheer beauty of Haydn's hand, however, the autograph
also holds a few hidden surprises. Taub, a practiced and eloquent
guide to the music he plays, goes briefly off the record to
fulminate against the reputable publishers who presume, in
supposedly authentic editions, to correct `` Haydn'' silently
rather than face up to his occasional waywardness.
</P>
<P>
   He points to the evidence of bars 40 and 48 of the second
movement, where the composer's clusters of 32nd-notes add up,
respectively, to an extra half beat and full beat per measure. On
no authority whatsoever, editors solve the equation by cutting
32nds in two, creating hasty flurries of 64th-notes that regularize
the meter but disrupt the eddy and flow of the music. No, the
pianist admits with a broad grin, the arithmetic doesn't up, ``and
Haydn just didn't care.''
</P>
<P>
   The reputation of an intellectual is a dubious asset for a
performer. Among contemporary pianists, perhaps only Alfred Brendel
and Maurizio Pollini have reconciled it with stardom.
</P>
<P>
   Taub, 43, could join them. For the last six years, he has been
artist in residence _ no courtesy title in this case _ at the
Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., an ivory tower
once peopled by the likes of Albert Einstein, J. Robert Oppenheimer
and John von Neumann. In truth, the institute is devoted to just
four disciplines: historical studies, mathematics, natural sciences
and social science. But maverick appointments may be made at the
director's discretion, which accounts for the presence of Taub.
</P>
<P>
   Taub lives mostly in Princeton. The average IQ at his sold-out
cycle of the Beethoven sonatas over the last three seasons at
Wolfensohn Hall there _ each concert repeated three times, with
introductory talks by the artist _ was assuredly far off to the
right on the bell curve. (Cycles on the Princeton model are now
under way at Merkin Concert Hall in New York and in other cities.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the scholarship of Taub's preparation, there is
nothing cerebral or chilly about his approach or his playing. A
comment on the way his mind responds to such documents prompts a
gently insistent demurrer. ``I immerse myself in the music, and the
music immerses itself in me,'' he says. ``It's not just a question
of what happens in the brain. It's very moving to me to hear an
autograph score.''
</P>
<P>
   On the experience of performance, Taub quotes T.S. Eliot, the
only artist previously appointed to the Institute for Advanced
Study: ``You are the music while the music lasts.'' (The passage is
from ``The Dry Salvages,'' one of the ``Four Quartets.'') But of
course, the music is to a superior degree the composer, and with
living specimens, it is possible to move beyond talismanic
communion to actual dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Persichetti, before his death, couched advice to Taub
about his Piano Concerto in suggestive language rather than in
musicians' shoptalk: ``gruff,'' for instance, or ``far off'' (and
not ``pianissimo''). Leon Kirchner, having let Taub play his
Sonata, said, ``Well, Bob, it's OK, but really it goes like this,''
and ran through it as if conjuring up the whole thing on the spot.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The living composer with whom Taub is now most closely
associated is Milton Babbitt, his composition professor for several
years at the Juilliard School and at Princeton. His intention in
these studies, Taub hastens to explain, was never to become a
composer but to develop an insider's understanding of musical
creativity.
</P>
<P>
   Looking over his shoulder as he tears into ``Canonical Form,''
which Babbitt composed for him, is an especially enlightening
experience. Under Taub's fingers, music widely considered dense and
cerebral sings and dances. A brisk rhythmic fanfare in the left
hand _ set down on the page like Neptune's trident _ jabs out a
theme that instantly begins generating new transformations, while
little splashes high on the keyboard tickle the ear like memories
of half-remembered show tunes.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt, as many music lovers know, taught Stephen Sondheim.
Babbitt, we are often reminded, comes out of Tin Pan Alley. Taub's
execution of Babbitt's gestures makes the imaginative connections
crystal clear. This is a rendition in the face of which prejudice
simply dissolves.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt's calligraphy strikes my eye as square, functional,
decisive: the writing of an engineer rather than, say, a physician.
Taub would prefer not to hear it described as ``technical,'' a term
that perhaps reinforces unfortunate prejudices. But Babbitt, like
many other composers, releases only fair copies. Taub himself has
never gained access to Babbitt's drafts or sketches. ``Milton keeps
them to himself,'' the pianist says. ``Brahms burned his.'' I N a
strange twist, Taub's Library of Congress recital complements the
Smithsonian Institution's current exhibit ``Piano 300.'' An
inventory of musical instruments in the possession of the Medici in
1700, which mentions ``un arpicembalo che fa il piano e il forte,''
``di nuova invenzione di Bartolomeo Cristofori'' (``a keyboard
instrument that plays both soft and loud, newly invented by
Bartolomeo Cristofori'') supplies the point of origin for the
three-century time line, and one of only three extant Cristoforis
(this one dated 1722) has been imported for the occasion from the
National Museum of Musical Instruments in Rome. The occasion would
seem made to order for a recital of works played on instruments of
their own periods.
</P>
<P>
   Pianists of the historical persuasion who might relish such an
exercise are legion. But the chosen instrument for Taub's art is
the modern Steinway: in particular, a Steinway engineered for
maximum control.
</P>
<P>
   A chapter of his book, ``Playing the Beethoven Piano Sonatas,''
in production with Amadeus Press, is titled ``The Myth of the
Authentic Pianoforte.'' Not that Taub scorns the lessons to be
learned from antiques.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make it my business to play for my own experience
pianofortes of periods appropriate to specific pieces of music,''
he says. ``I've tried the early Beethoven sonatas on pianofortes of
the late 1790s, the `Waldstein' Sonata on a pianoforte of 1804 or
1805 and the later sonatas on pianofortes of the 1810s and early
1820s. What's interesting to me is the way Beethoven's compositions
transcend the instruments of their time, forcing the piano builders
to develop ever greater sonority and technological refinement. The
`Waldstein' was written in 1804. You can barely play it on a piano
of that time. You can't play it at all on a piano of 1797. The
range, the sonorous capacity, the sensitivity of pedal mechanisms _
none of these would be sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to think in terms of overall perception. Not only have
pianos changed, but our sphere of hearing has become enlarged. In
Beethoven's time, there were no screaming fire engines, no
airplanes. A thunderstorm was a major aural event. The day I play a
concert on a fortepiano will be the day when the whole audience
arrives by horse-drawn carriages and the hall is lit with candles
and everyone has become totally immersed in the aural world of the
early 19th century. And that will never be.''(BOX)

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Large contrasts in temperature will be the salient weather
feature in the Northeast as humid air surges across the Middle
Atlantic states against cool, almost autumnal air holding its
ground over New England. Broken clusters of showers and
thunderstorms will move in a line along the sharp boundary between
these vastly disparate air masses.
</P>
<P>
   The mercury will soar toward 100 degrees across parts of the
South Carolina piedmont, and isolated thunderstorms forming along a
sea breeze front will dot Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the South Carolina heat, a chilly rain, perhaps
mixed with snowflakes, will fall near the central Canadian border,
where an unseasonably cold air mass knifes into the Plains. Farther
east, thunderstorms will erupt along and ahead of a cool front
spanning from the southern Great Lakes to the central Mississippi
Valley.  &QL;

   FOCUS: WAR ON WILDFIRE
</P>
<P>
   Winds several thousand feet above New Mexico ordained the
outcome of Thursday's futile war against wildfires. Once the sun
rose, currents of air rising from the warming ground led to kindred
currents of sinking air that transferred momentum from fast winds
aloft toward the surface. Ground-level winds of 25 to 50 mph
resulted from the downward transfer, fanning flames. Moreover, the
air aloft was very dry. Thus, the downward transfer also lowered
surface humidity, another factor that encouraged the spread of the
wildfire.

<P>
   New Orleans is famous for its dining, yet many places survive
largely on reputation or proximity to tourists. Ask around; nearly
everyone in town has strong opinions on restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Among new places, our favorite was Cuvee (322 Magazine St.;
(504) 587-9001.) An airy, dark-wood dining room with a high,
gold-leaf ceiling, it features excellent service and
Spanish/French-tinged New Orleans cuisine with such superb dishes
as sugar-cane smoked duck breast served with Roquefort-pecan
risotto and foie gras, and a smoked lamb and goat cheese
quesadilla, served with traditional mole sauce. Desserts, such as a
chocolate and banana ``tres leches'' torte, and the extensive wine
list were equally sublime.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon Grass (221 Camp St., in the International House hotel;
(504) 553-9550) is run by chef Minh Bui, who was named chef of the
year in '99 by New Orleans magazine. The serene setting offers such
nontraditional New Orleans fare as shrimp dumplings, wok-smoked
salmon steak and roasted five-spice duck breast with sweet rice and
baby bok choy.
</P>
<P>
   Getting attention for its contemporary creole dishes is Gamay
Bistro (320 Decatur St., in the Bienville House Hotel; (504)
299-8800); it was named one of the city's best new restaurants of
'99 by several critics. And we wanted to eat at Dick and Jenny's,
(4501 Tchoupitoulas St; (504) 894-9880). This small, casual cafe,
which opened last year, has become a local favorite for its creole
fare by chef Richard Benz, but the two-hour wait on a Friday night
dissuaded us, even though the folks in line on the leafy patio
seemed happy enough.
</P>
<P>
   Established spots that seem to be holding up include Nola, (534
St. Louis; (504) 522-6652) another of celeb chef Emeril Lagasse's
operations. The 2-story space, with an exhibition kitchen, is
bright and relaxed, yet offers good service for such specialties as
rich crawfish pie and shrimp pasta with warm remoulade.
</P>
<P>
   K-Paul's Louisiana Kitchen (416 Chartres; (504) 524-7394) and
its expansive chef, Paul Prudhomme, put Cajun cooking on the map;
an airy redesign a few years ago also added a slightly more formal
second dining room. The food, especially simple things like the
fried oysters, is still fresh and decadently rich; the attitude can
still be a bit we-don't-need-you.
</P>
<P>
   We also still like the po' boys and jambalaya at the
standing-room-only Acme Oyster House (724 Iberville; (504)
522-5973); the grilled muffulettas at the equally crowded Johnny's
Po-Boys (511 St. Louis; (504) 524-8129) and brunch at Commander's
Palace (1403 Washington Ave.; (504) 899-8221). Order a Bloody Mary
and the shrimp remoulade.

<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ Ruling that respect for gays and lesbians
is a more fundamental value than freedom of speech, Canada's
broadcast watchdog has thunderously condemned American radio host
Dr. Laura Schlessinger, warning that her program could ignite
antigay violence.
</P>
<P>
   In what may be the most strongly-worded ruling in the body's
history, the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council rebuked
Schlessinger for what it called ``abusively discriminatory''
violations of Canada's broadcast code for stating that homosexual
behavior is ``abnormal,'' ``aberrant,'' and ``deviant.'' The
comments were made on her popular radio call-in program.
</P>
<P>
   The council also condemned Canadian radio stations that
broadcast the show, and will require them to censor antigay
comments on future broadcasts and to broadcast statements on the
ruling at prime time _ in effect, warning Canadian listeners
against Schlessinger's ideas.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual aside, the council stepped back from
Schlessinger's show to take a swipe at the fundamental American
precept that even unpopular opinions have the right to be aired.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Canada, we respect freedom of speech but do not worship
it,'' the council stated.
</P>
<P>
   The self-policing industry regulatory group, to which 430
private Canadian radio and television stations belong, denounced
Schlessinger's views as tantamount to racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sexual practices of gays and lesbians are as much a part
of their being as the color of one's skin or the gender, religion,
age or ethnicity of an individual,'' the council ruled late
Wednesday. ``To use such brutal language as she does about such an
essential characteristic flies in the face of Canadian provisions
relating to human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling marked the second time in recent years that Canada
has sought to swat a controversial American radio personality from
the northern airwaves. In the mid-1990s, Howard Stern _ then aired
by two Canadian stations _ came under fire from the broadcast
council for referring to French-Quebecers as ``scumbags'' and
saying they should learn English.
</P>
<P>
   Stern's show has since been dropped by a Montreal station and is
closely monitored and occasionally edited by the Toronto
broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of gay rights in Canada were jubilant about the
harshly-worded ruling against Schlessinger, whose conservative
notions have also drawn protests in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on Cloud Nine,'' said Ian Crowe of Halifax, one of the
four individuals who filed formal complaints against Dr. Laura with
the council. ``I feel I've done good for the world. . . . What this
says is Dr. Laura is not allowed to call me deviant, aberrant,
disordered or dysfunctional.''
</P>
<P>
   According to industry estimates, Schlessinger's show attracts
about 18 million listeners on nearly 500 stations in the United
States and Canada. She also writes a column that appears in more
than 100 newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, it is a criminal offense to ``willfully promote
hatred'' against an ``identifiable group,'' a category that
includes racial, religious and ethnic minorities as well as people
whose only common bond is their sexuality, such as gays or
lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Cohen, chairman of the broadcast council, said Canadian
radio stations may still broadcast Schlessinger's show but must
censor any comments that insult or denigrate homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human rights are very important for the CBSC,'' he said.
``This is one of the clearest judgments on this issue we have
released.''
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling, the council acknowledged that Schlessinger did
not ``advocate any of the homophobic hostility or, worse,
brutality, which can be found in criminal corners of society.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the ruling warned, broadcasting her views on gay
and lesbian issues ``(might) fertilize the ground for other less
well-balanced elements . . . to take such aggressive steps.''

THE WHOLE TRUTH ON MALCOLM X 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the least, there is something of historical value in Louis
Farrakhan's qualified expression of regret for his role in the
assassination of Malcolm X.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I may have been complicit in words that I spoke leading up
to'' the murder of Malcolm X, Farrakhan told Malcolm's daughter,
Atallah Shabazz, in a ``60 Minutes'' interview taped last month,
``I acknowledge that and regret that any word that I have said
caused the loss of life of a human being.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan, ill with cancer, may have wished to seek forgiveness
from the people who suffered most directly from Malcolm's loss. The
Nation of Islam leader also sought reconciliation recently with
Wallace Deen Mohammad, the son of the Nation of Islam's founder,
Elijah Mohammad, and a person who remained close to Malcolm after
Malcolm criticized Elijah Mohammad and left the Nation of Islam to
found his own organization.
</P>
<P>
   As the memory of Malcolm becomes encrusted with political myths,
it is more important than ever that coming generations can see
clearly the differences between him and the men who had him
assassinated. Farrakhan called Malcolm a traitor for breaking with
Elijah Mohammad and wrote in the Nation of Islam's paper two months
before Malcolm was gunned down that ``such a man is worthy of
death.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan's saying to Malcolm's daughter that he ``begs God's
mercy and forgiveness'' for those words leaves the impression that
his sole transgression was to write words that may have
inadvertently contributed to the assassin's decision to murder
Malcolm.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the three convicted killers, Thomas Hagan, in an
affadavit filed 13 years after the killing to attest that his two
co-defendants were innocent and that he acted with four other Black
Muslims, said the assassination was ordered as a religious duty. In
a 1979 article in the Globe, Hagan said: ``There was like a chain
of command in the Nation, and I thought that somebody higher up had
spoken to somebody in our group. . .''
</P>
<P>
   For the sake of history, if not for his own inner peace,
Farrakhan ought to say all he knows about the decision to have
Malcolm killed 35 years ago.

COPYRIGHTS AND MP3 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The US Constitution gives Congress the power to establish
copyright protections ``to promote the progress of science and the
useful arts.'' This principle is as valid today as when the
Constitution was written in 1787. Congress and the courts need to
adapt it to the Internet, which offers access to an extraordinary
amount of information even as it provides opportunity to limit what
people see, hear, and read.
</P>
<P>
   Intense legal battles are being waged today over the use of MP3
technology, which allows the transmission of high-fidelity music in
a compressed form. Computer-users are able to amass collections of
hundreds of songs on their PCs.
</P>
<P>
   The recording industry might have embraced this technology as a
new, more convenient way of getting music to its customers, but it
has been slow to allow the release of material by well-known
performers. Several Internet companies, notably MP3.com and
Napster, have stepped into this vacuum. The Recording Industry
Association of America accuses them of copyright infringement and
has tried to shut them down or curtail their use of popular
material.
</P>
<P>
   The association has a point about Napster. This program,
available at no cost on the Internet, allows anyone who signs up to
share MP3 files with any other Napster members. Thursday afternoon,
5,423 Napsterites were on line with 621,881 songs (many of them
duplicates). Some of the music came from aspiring artists eager to
be heard, but most was by famous acts, who would much rather have
fans buy their compact discs so they could collect royalties.
Needless to say, most famous performers have not given Napster or
Napster members permission to run a song-sharing service.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com had a better idea. It wanted to create a database of
80,000 popular CDs and allow access only to people who could prove
electronically that they owned, or at least had physical possession
of, the actual CD. The Napster case is pending, but Judge Jed S.
Rakoff in New York federal court ruled last month that the MP3.com
plan violated the recording industry's many copyright protections.
Both companies have since taken steps to reduce their legal
exposure, but the larger issues remain.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of CDs are not without rights. Under the legal doctrine
of ``fair use,'' first promulgated in 1840 and upheld repeatedly
since then, people can make many uses of copyright material: using
a portion in a book review, sampling a bit of a song for a musical
parody, and making a recording for their own, noncommercial use.
</P>
<P>
   This week heavy metal group Metallica forced Napster to ban
317,377 users from the service on the ground they had illegally
copied Metallica songs. But suppose someone owned the entire
Metallica CD and just wanted to use Napster to make MP3 copies of a
few tunes? That ought to be considered ``fair use,'' and the
MP3.com approach would have allowed this copying.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the recording industry wins all its battles in court,
new programs are being developed to allow the sharing of MP3 files.
Gnutella and other programs eliminate the key legal vulnerability
of Napster _ its dependence on central computers to facilitate
file-sharing.
</P>
<P>
   The recording industry is pinning its hopes for protecting its
wares on encryption. The Sony Corp., which pioneered the Walkman
technology that revolutionized music listening, has devised the
Music Clip, a new kind of portable music player that forces users
to convert MP3 files into a coded format. When Sony invented the
Walkman, which played unencrypted tape cassettes, it had not yet
bought the CBS recording company.
</P>
<P>
   Encryption denies the buyer an opportunity to move the music
into different formats, to combine selected cuts off CDs or to use
bits for parody or other legal purposes. It would seem to violate
the ``fair use'' doctrine. Congress and the courts need to refine
copyright protection in a way that benefits consumers as well as
giant industries.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, major record companies ought to go beyond legal
stratagems to define a marketing program that fully utilizes the
MP3 format. The songs of Metallica and other famous artists ought
to be available for a small fee, and the work of those popular acts
ought to be featured on the same site as those of emerging artists,
as MP3.com had planned.
</P>
<P>
   The great promise of Internet technology is that it will make
``science and the useful arts'' widely available at the touch of a
computer mouse. The recording industry should not let Draconian
interpretations of the copyright laws inhibit the growth of this
powerful medium.

 &HT;    U.S. SHOULD PAY MORE FOR EVERGLADES RESTORATION, FLORIDA SAYS
 &HT;    BY SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Florida Gov. Jeb Bush urged federal lawmakers
Thursday to pay an equal share in a plan to restore the Everglades,
the largest public works project since the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, joined by Florida's two senators, Bob Graham, D, and
Connie Mack, R, also asked the Senate Environment and Public Works
Committee to reject the administration's proposal to give the
federal government more of a role in the allocation of water
resources in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers estimates that the restoration
of the Everglades, whose natural flow of fresh water has been
disrupted by agricultural diversion and public works projects, will
take about 25 years and cost a total of $7.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Corps submitted a restoration plan last July that the
administration included in its Water Resource Development Act
introduced in Congress last month.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would give the Army Corps of Engineers, the
Interior Department, and several other federal and state agencies
the right to evaluate and approve all restoration projects within
the Everglades. It also recommends the state pay 60 percent of the
overall costs and the federal government 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida believes that it should be on equal footing with the
federal government not only in terms of financing, but in managing,
governing and operating this project,'' Bush told the Senate panel.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Florida legislature approved a bill allocating $2
billion in state funds for the restoration over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Seminole and the Miccosukee Indian tribes
living within the Everglades echoed Bush's concerns that the
federal government would be too involved in the water management of
the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attempting to federalize the water allocation decisions
blatantly disregards the existing body of Florida water law. With
Florida's water law thrown into disarray by this approach, the
Tribe's Water Compact is jeopardized,'' said Patricia Power, a
spokeswoman for the Seminole tribe.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of federal officials from the Army Corps of Engineers,
the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department
asked the lawmakers to approve the administration's proposal and
not delay the Everglades restoration any longer.
</P>
<P>
   One panel member, Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., expressed doubts
about the overall costs of the restoration plan and its long-term
feasibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has provided a compelling case that this plan is going
to work,'' said Baucus.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., chairman of the committee, said he would
consider offering the Everglades restoration as a separate bill and
not include it as part of the water resource legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will follow whichever path that gives an Everglades bill the
best chance of becoming law this year,'' said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he expected the full Senate to vote on Everglades
legislation before its July 4 recess.

   &UR; ``If it don't go up, don't buy it.'' &LR;  _ Will Rogers, on
investing in stocks
</P>
<P>
   Never has anyone put that tongue-in-cheek advice to use more
brazenly than Carnegie Investment Management, which obtained
millions of shares in Mattel Inc. by promising to pay more than the
market price. It got the shares, but it didn't pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   Carnegie did that through a tender offer that seemed to be on
the up-and-up. Word of the tender was distributed by the Depository
Trust Corp., the backbone of the country's share-trading network,
which also allowed its facilities to be used to collect the shares
from tendering investors. They wound up in an account at
PaineWebber.
</P>
<P>
   Then the people behind the tender, brothers named Jeffrey and
Hubert Leach, borrowed $10 million against the value of the stock
they had not paid for. They used the money for what their broker
described as ``day trading'' in technology stocks. But that trading
did not go well, and Mattel's stock price also slid. There were
margin calls, and PaineWebber sold some of the Mattel stock to
cover losses in the account. Carnegie filed for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really gets me is that I didn't do anything wrong,'' says
Stuart Scolnik, a 34-year-old Miami man who tendered 22,000 Mattel
shares to Carnegie, expecting to receive $346,500. ``Nobody gave me
even a little bit of a heads-up.''
</P>
<P>
   He isn't alone. All told, Carnegie took in more than 2 million
Mattel shares, many of them from institutional investors. A few
were paid for, but most weren't. Investors are out their shares,
with nothing to show for it. They are likely to get far less than
they are owed when Carnegie's bankruptcy is wrapped up.
</P>
<P>
   The tender offer was made last November, and that is when
Carnegie got the shares and began to borrow money on them. It was
able to string along complaining shareholders until March 24, when
if filed for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   None of this could have happened if Wall Street institutions
took the slimmest precautions in handling minitender offers, so
called because they are for less than 5 percent of a company's
stock and therefore need not be registered with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The DTC charged Carnegie a fee of $2,700 for publicizing its
offer to banks and brokerage firms across the country, and
PaineWebber allowed tendered shares to be sent to one of its
accounts, which it administered because PaineWebber was the
clearing broker for First Colonial Securities, the brokerage firm
Carnegie used.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody admits to any responsibility. The shares were delivered
``free-and-clear'' to PaineWebber through the DTC, which
PaineWebber figured meant there was no reason to think a tender
offer was involved. First Colonial's broker on the Carnegie account
said Jeffrey Leach told him payment was being made, but did not say
how. A lawyer for Leach declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   At Depository Trust, a spokesman says his firm followed its own
rules, which were approved by the SEC, and did nothing wrong. He
says officials are considering proposing changes in the rules so
that the DTC would not handle tender offers unless precautions were
taken to assure that those who tendered would get paid.
</P>
<P>
   That should have been done long ago. Now the Wall Street
institutions involved should step up and reimburse the investors
who have suffered because precautions were not taken. So far, there
are no volunteers.

   Getting around:
</P>
<P>
   Flights arrive at New Orleans International Airport, about 20
miles (or a 30-minute drive) from downtown. One-way cab fare to
downtown is $21 for one or two people; shuttle vans cost $10 per
person, one-way; the city bus costs $1.50 one way from the airport.
If you plan to stay mostly in the French Quarter, don't bother with
a rental car; parking is scarce and expensive, and you can walk or
take a cab to most tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Staying there:
</P>
<P>
   The city has more than 30,000 hotel rooms, plus a growing number
of bed-and-breakfast inns. Expect to pay at least $100 a night for
a room in the French Quarter or in the neighboring Central Business
District or Garden District, though you may find specials or a
budget room for as low as $60, particularly during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The newest options include:
</P>
<P>
   International House Hotel (221 Camp St.; (504) 553-9550;
www.ihhotel.com) has won plaudits from travel writers and design
editors since opening in late '98, and rightfully so. It blends New
Orleans style (a renovated 1906 Beaux Arts building that was the
city's first international trade center) with contemporary
furnishings. Large guest rooms are outfitted with down comforters
and high-thread-count sheets in cool shades of taupe and cream;
there are CD players, showers with dual shower heads and stocked
honor bars. The understated, candlelit Loa bar draws an attractive
crowd, mostly twentysomething to fortysomething. Doubles from $189.
</P>
<P>
   W French Quarter (316 Rue Chartres; (504) 581-1200;
www.whotels.com) took over the former Hotel de la Poste and its
quiet-but-central location on a good shopping street in the French
Quarter. Like all Ws, its rooms feature electronic goodies like CD
players, high-speed data ports and TVs hooked to high-speed
Internet access via an infrared keyboard. Homier comforts include
cotton bathrobes, Aveda toiletries and goose-down comforters on the
feather-mattress beds. Its house restaurant is Bacco, an Italian
eatery from the famous Brennan restaurant family. Doubles from
$179.
</P>
<P>
   Its sister hotel, the W New Orleans, (333 Poydras St.; (504)
525-9444; www.whotels.com) is a renovated Sheraton and also has all
the W goodies; it's close to the new Harrah's casino and a couple
of blocks from the French Quarter. Its house bar is Whiskey Blue, a
streamlined, dimly lit lounge filled with beautiful people, mostly
under 30, and owned by nightclub entrepreneur Rande Gerber, also
known as Cindy Crawford's husband. Doubles from $149.
</P>
<P>
   St. James Hotel (330 Magazine St.; (504) 539-9000) is a new
luxury boutique hotel in a restored building with a more
traditional New Orleans feel; there are rooftop terraces and rooms
featuring four-poster beds and marble baths, along with such modern
touches as data ports, two phone lines and mini-bars. Doubles from
$179.
</P>
<P>
   The Ritz-Carlton New Orleans (901 Canal St.; (504) 524-1331) is
slated to open July 31 in the former Maison Blanche department
store and the historic Kress Building. After $200 million in
renovations, the hotel will preserve the art nouveau style and
introduce a French-tinged decor in purple, gold and green. There
will also be a day spa and a creole/Continental restaurant,
Victor's, named for a restaurant that operated on the site in the
1830s. Special introductory rates through August, $175 double.
</P>
<P>
   What's new:
</P>
<P>
   Jazzland, a theme park with 30 rides, daily Mardi Gras parades
and Cajun and creole food, opens Saturday at the intersection of
Interstates 10 and 510. A special feature is the skycoaster, a kind
of simulated freefall in which riders are hoisted 170 feet into the
air, then pull a rip cord that swings them out over a lake. The
ride is an extra $25. General admission is $28.44, adults; $23.86,
children under 48 inches tall; free, children age 2 and under;
$14.22, guests over age 60. ( (504) 253-8000; www.jazzland2000.com)
</P>
<P>
   Harrah's opened its giant casino in October at 512 Canal St.,
within walking distance of the convention center and the French
Quarter. Decorated in an ornate New Orleans style, with fountains,
wrought-iron accents, Mardi Gras floats and plenty of twinkling
lights, the gambling halls contain 3,000 slot machines, costing
from a nickel to $500 a pull, and 120 table games. The casino
doesn't include a hotel, but there is a buffet and a small food
court serving Popeye's Chicken, po' boys and other regional dishes.

GIULIANI DENIES HE'LL DROP OUT OF SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One day after the most downcast news conference of
his career _ where he announced that he and his wife were
separating _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani regained his fire Thursday,
denying reports that he was dropping out of the Senate race and
scolding the press for poking into his private life.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also denied the charge _ publicly leveled on Wednesday
by his wife, Donna Hanover _ that he had an affair a few years ago
with his then-communications director, Cristyne Lategano.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Giuliani did not exclude the possibility that he would
end his run for the Senate, saying he must still decide what kind
of treatment to undergo for his prostate cancer, which was
diagnosed two weeks ago, and then determine whether he would have
the stamina for a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made a lot of important decisions,'' the mayor and former
federal prosecutor said. ``I've learned you make those decisions
when you have to make them. I don't have to make it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, top Republicans _ including Governor George Pataki,
New York Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, and presidential
candidate George W. Bush _ Thursday rallied around the embattled
mayor as their only choice to carry the banner in the contest
against First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans continued to put out feelers about alternative
candidates. But unless and until the mayor drops out, the party
leaders have decided not to reveal the slightest split or
hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're afraid of Hillary winning, above all else,'' said one
person close to top Republicans, ``so they don't want to give her a
boost.''
</P>
<P>
   A few other Republicans have expressed an interst in running if
the mayor withdraws _ Long Island Congressmen Rick Lazio and Peter
King, and financier Ted Forstmann _ but few think they could match
the war chest, or the growing popularity, of Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Polls suggest Pataki could mount a challenge and possibly even
beat the first lady, but the governor flatly said last week that he
would not run, even if Giuliani did not.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Clinton is in an awkward position herself. She
must carry on as if Giuliani will be her opponent _ though her
strategy will have to change if he is not. At the same time, she
cannot remotely attack Giuliani, partly because of her own marital
troubles, partly because it would be unseemly to attack a man with
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to, out of respect for him and his family, have
nothing to say about it,'' Mrs. Clinton said on NBC-TV's ``Today
Show,'' when asked about the mayor's separation.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in Washington, said of Giuliani's problems,
``Everybody in America ought to be rooting for the human side of
this to work out. We should wish him well.''
</P>
<P>
   Even New York's new archbishop, Edward M. Egan, was asked about
Giuliani at his maiden press conference. Egan expressed ``the
greatest sympathy for this good human being who is struggling
through two very serious situations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate race these past two weeks has been transformed into a
non-stop melodrama about the intimacies of Giuliani's life. On Apr.
26, he announced that he had a treatable form of prostate cancer.
Less than a week later, he confirmed reports that he has been
seeing Judith Nathan, an Upper East Side divorcee, for nearly a
year. Wednesday, he nervously announced the separation from his
wife. A few hours later, Hanover tearily said, on the steps of
Gracie Mansion, that their marriage went sour because of the
mayor's relationship with Lategano.
</P>
<P>
   Lategano resigned her post a year ago and then became, at
Giuliani's behest, head of the city's tourist bureau, which pays
$150,000 a year. She has since married someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of an affair between the two were widely reported three
years ago, but were never proven. Giuliani and Lategano both denied
the rumors three years ago. While Giuliani did not directly
contradict his wife's words, he said Thursday, ``I definitively
answered all these questions...way back, and it's the exact same
answer today.''
</P>
<P>
   Some politicos were privately worried by Hanover's accusation.
It is one thing, they said, for the husband in a bad marriage to
have an affair _ quite another to have wrecked the marriage with an
earlier affair, and then to give that alleged paramour a plum city
job.

&HT;     BUSH PLAN ADDRESSES A `PHONY CRISIS,' ECONOMIST SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, May 14)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ George W. Bush outlines his Social Security plan on
Monday against a backdrop of doomsday predictions that include a
survey showing more young people believe in UFOs than think the
government benefits will last until their retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, says liberal economist Dean Baker, co-founder of
the Washington-based Center for Economic and Policy Research, and
co-author of a book called ``Social Security: The Phony Crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Social Security is not collapsing, he insists. And to the extent
that it may need propping up, growth levels even below those of
today's vibrant U.S. economy would be sufficient to keep it healthy
beyond 2050, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The magnitude of the problem is very different from what 99
percent of the public understands it to be,'' Baker said in an
interview. If the public knew the system was sound for at least 37
years and that even in the worst-case scenario Social Security
could still pay 75 percent of benefits thereafter, ``I don't think
there would be serious debate'' on a major overhaul, Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush and many Democrats are taking no chances. The Texas
governor, in one of the biggest dice-tossing acts of his bid to
become president, will talk Monday about how he intends to deal
with the Social Security trust fund running out of money. Beyond
refusing to loan the system's revenues to other government
programs, Bush is calling for private investment accounts that put
a portion of payroll taxes into the stock and bond markets.
</P>
<P>
   Even before he details his plan, his Democratic opponent, Vice
President Al Gore, has lost no time in condemning it as ``risky''
and ``irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore would use the surplus in the Social Security trust fund _
about $2.2 trillion over 10 years _ to pay down the national debt.
Gore has said the billions of dollars in interest that would have
gone to service the debt would instead flow into the Social
Security trust fund, guaranteeing the system's financial health
through 2050.
</P>
<P>
   In Baker's view, they're both wrong. He says Bush's modified
privatization plan _ in which the government would guarantee
retirement income against precipitous dips in the market _ would be
``an elaborate way of having government invest in the stock
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also is on the wrong track, Baker says, because his plan
would tie up trillions of dollars in a scheme to fix a system that
isn't broken. ``If we say you can't touch that money, we're
neglecting those needs we have now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The future of Social Security looks bleak because of some basic
demographic facts. The 65-year-old federal pay-as-you-go system
provides $32.5 billion in monthly benefits to 44.5 million retirees
and persons with disabilities. Money comes into the system from the
12.4 percent payroll tax paid by current employees.
</P>
<P>
   Although more money currently is flowing into Social Security
than is going out, that will change as the 77-million strong
baby-boomer born between 1946 and 1964 begin retiring _ some of
them early _ in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   With that many retirees supported by the 44-million ``Generation
X,'' born between 1965 and 1977, the trust fund will begin to drain
in 2023 and go empty on 2037.
</P>
<P>
   However, the system's annual trustees' report has moved the
drop-dead date forward in time for three years in a row, thanks to
a nearly full-employment economy with more workers paying Social
Security taxes. The date went from 2032 in 1998 to 2037 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Baker says, ``If we kept (the current annual economic growth
level of) about 4 percent out into the future, Social Security
would be fine forever.'' But neither Baker nor most economists
expect that.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even with a modest growth rate of 2.5 percent annually,
Social Security would be in good shape through 2050, Baker says.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the drop-dead date might be, Social Security still
would have its payroll tax income and could pay 75 percent of
benefits. ``So even if we do absolutely nothing, there will always
will be a very large sum of money there.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker has many detractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Baker's) hypothesis that we might grow our way out of the
problem reminds me of what conservatives said about the deficit in
the 1980s,'' said Richard Thau, a privatization supporter who heads
Third Millennium, the organization that produced the 1994 survey
about UFOs and Social Security. ``It seems preposterous.''
</P>
<P>
   Thau notes that Social Security payments average $804 a month, a
subsistence retirement for the many low-income workers who depend
on it primarily. Setting up private accounts is an effort to ``grow
wealth'' for people who have none, Thau insists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of reason for personal accounts (is to tell
subsistence-level retirees), `You don't need to live on cat food.
We can elevate you to tuna fish,''' Thau said.
</P>
<P>
   Even economists who oppose privatization are not fully sold on
Baker's ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Aaron, senior economist at the Washington-based Brookings
Institution, agrees that ``there is no crisis'' in Social
Seckurity. But he says political leaders would be shirking their
duty if they ignored the projections of the system's looming
insolvency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to move ahead carefully and gradually,'' Aaron said.

SPORTS COLUMN: RETIRED MAJOR LEAGUERS BEING CONSIDERED FOR OLYMPIC
TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They may call themselves retired, but baseball players like to
think they could roll out of bed on Christmas Day and whack a
curveball, or throw one.
</P>
<P>
   Now a few retired players are being cajoled by seductive
whisperings of Olympic gold medals and one more road trip to beat
all road trips. The voice belongs to Bob Watson, who was general
manager of the Yankees when they won the so-called World Series in
1996. Watson has now moved on to truly global events, serving as
co-chairman of the selection committee for the U.S. baseball team
at the Summer Games in Sydney, Australia, in September.
</P>
<P>
   He tosses out a few names like Tim Raines, Chili Davis, Jimmy
Key, Terry Steinbach, Pat Kelly, Orestes Destrade, all currently
retired.
</P>
<P>
   He needs a talent pool because the Olympics, which opened for
the Jordans and Everts and Gretzkys in the past decade, are now
open to baseball professionals.
</P>
<P>
   The South Koreans are closing down their pro league in September
to send their very best, the Japanese leagues are sending a
legitimate all-star team, and the Cubans are sending their
state-supported amateurs who dominate world tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our college guys cannot compete with them,'' Watson said,
correctly.
</P>
<P>
   There is a major league cast to the manager, a chap named
Lasorda, but Major League Baseball is not about to do what the NHL
did in 1998 and will do again in 2002: shut down for a few weeks
and let its players represent their countries.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with this hard line, Dave Nilsson, the Australian catcher,
left the Milwaukee Brewers to play in Japan this season, in order
to represent his own country this September.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball may grant a furlough to a few
professionals buried down deep on some 40-man roster, but Watson is
forced to seek talent that may currently be changing diapers,
playing golf and clipping coupons. ``The big question is, you shut
down mentally when you stop playing,'' said Watson, who retired in
1984, after 19 years. ``You go, `Wheeeew.' You don't worry about
doing it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Watson understands the skill and confidence that reside
in retired players. He guaranteed that Manny Mota, the Dodgers'
62-year-old coach, could still hit, although he does not plan to
recruit Mota, who is of Dominican ancestry, at any rate.
</P>
<P>
   Watson is going after more recent players, including Pat Kelly,
once a Yankees second baseman, who retired this spring after his
shoulder did not recover from surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly was already enthused about the Summer Games because his
wife is from Adelaide, and they plan to raise their family in
Australia. He recently did commentary for a television channel in
Australia, covering the Intercontinental Cup, baseball's major
amateur tournament, and while in Sydney, he sneaked into the
Olympic Stadium to look around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable stadium,'' he said. ``The games are going to be
so great.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he can dream about marching in the opening parade, and
representing his own country in his wife's homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd help out in any capacity _ coach, scout, hit fly balls,''
he said. ``But if I can play, that would be great.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson is urging players to start looking for a semipro team in
their area, so he can send around a scout to see if their legs and
waistlines and arms are still acceptable. He will assemble a large
squad by early July, and then announce a team of 24 regulars and
six alternates by Aug. 23.
</P>
<P>
   He understands he is tinkering with the pride of major leaguers,
but said: ``I can talk to them a whole lot easier than a college
coach can. I coached in the World Series, I was general manager in
the World Series. I can call somebody up and say, `Hey, Rock.'''
</P>
<P>
   He would love to use Raines, the highly popular 40-year-old who
is coping with lupus and could not quite make it back with the
Yankees this spring although he was in good physical shape.
</P>
<P>
   Watson also heard from Orestes Destrade, a Cuban-born slugger
who had nine admirable seasons in Japan and finished up with
Florida in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Chili Davis, a mature presence with the Yankees his final two
years, has been enjoying not having people tell him what to do
after 20 years of following orders. Of all people, Davis has the
imagination to be intrigued, the way Watson is.
</P>
<P>
   As a player, Watson never imagined himself walking in the
opening ceremonies but now he says: ``All I want is on Sept. 27 to
hear the national anthem playing for the gold-medal ceremony.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson sells the image of the parade to his major league
colleagues. He counts on their inner voice, the one that says they
can still play.

IRISHMAN'S FIND ENDS 21-YEAR ODDYSEY OF BOTTLE WITH MESSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANNA WEISS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a storybook idea, culled from books and beachcombing days
and idyllic Nantucket summers. In early September of 1979, Amy
Turano and Valerie Wozniak _ 13-year-old friends who had read about
messages in bottles _ decided they wanted to send one of their own.
</P>
<P>
   They threw a bottle in the surf, but it kept rolling back
ashore. So Amy's father suggested they drop it, instead, from the
ferry to Hyannis, Mass., deep into Nantucket Sound.
</P>
<P>
   This one came back, too. Twenty-one years later.
</P>
<P>
   The green wine bottle, which the girls had filled with notes and
sealed with wax, rolled onto the beach of Derrymore, Ireland, this
March, tossed by currents that could have carried it from Britain
to the Equator and back. It was sitting on the high-tide mark,
covered with kelp and shells. When Michael Wall first saw it, he
walked right by.
</P>
<P>
   Wall, 48, an avid fisherman with four children and four dogs,
works in a cattle feed mill nearby. The beach is his regular haunt,
and bottles are commonplace. But when he walked by this one again,
with his golden retriever, he noticed paper inside. He picked it up
and took it home.
</P>
<P>
   By the time his wife and daughter came in, he had broken the
bottle _ the only way he could get it open. He found a letter
inside, with a date and time: 1 p.m., September 2, 1979. And a
request: please fill out an accompanying note and mail it to one of
the girls. There were two addresses listed, both in Colchester,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do not send the note back,'' the message went on,
``just put these papers back in the bottle and throw it in the
ocean. Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Wall was 27, living in the same town, working at the
same mill. Valerie Wozniak and Amy Turano were Connecticut girls on
the brink of adolescence. Those days, the Turanos rented a cottage
on Nantucket Island for couple of weeks each summer, and allowed
their son and daughter to invite friends along.
</P>
<P>
   That year, the kids had read a story about a boy who sent a
message in a bottle and made a new friend, said Amy Turano _ now
Amy Thurber. They were inspired to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Andrew Turano, a pediatrician with a logical mind,
didn't have much hope for the plan. ``Children have imaginations
and they read stories,'' he said. ``You know how skeptical parents
are.''
</P>
<P>
   So he told them their odds of success were low, but he helped
them, anyway, sealing the bottle and selecting the drop-off point,
midway between Nantucket and Hyannis. Based on his knowledge of
currents, he said, ``I figured if it ever landed anywhere, it would
land on the British Isles.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, the girls leaned over the ferry railing on a
cloudy day and watched the bottle disappear. They talked about it
for a year or two, Thurber said, but ``it definitely was out of my
mind for a very long time.'' In the intervening years, the girls
graduated from high school together and slowly drifted apart.
</P>
<P>
   Thurber went to the Rhode Island School of Design, married,
divorced, and married again. She is now 34, a graphic designer and
illustrator, living in South Dartmouth, Mass. with her husband and
three-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   The girls _ now women _ haven't spoken in years, though their
parents still live in the same neighborhood in Colchester, half a
mile apart.
</P>
<P>
   It was to those parents' homes that Wall sent his response,
along with a copy of his local newspaper, which had written a story
about his remarkable find.
</P>
<P>
   Another local man recently found a message in a bottle some ten
miles off, Wall said in a telephone interview from his home
Thursday, but it had only been in the water for a year or two. This
one was special _ ``a long journey, you know,'' he said.
``Everybody's been asking me since.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, his newfound friends across the Atlantic hope he'll come to
the United States someday; Thurber would like to invite him
fishing. She also wants to take her son, Benjamin, to Nantucket,
where she hopes he'll pass the days as she did: catching firefiles,
feeding birds, walking the beach, making summer wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she said, her family isn't finished with its ocean
dreams. Her brother Paul, now 31, dropped a bottle of his own on
the same September day, 21 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He's still waiting to hear where it lands.

VATICAN LOYALIST TO SUCCEED N.Y. CARDINAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Egan is becoming an archbishop, not a cardinal.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bishop Edward M. Egan, a staunch Vatican loyalist credited with
bettering the schools, finances, and recruitment of priests in
Bridgeport, Conn., was tapped Thursday by Pope John Paul II to
replace the late Cardinal John O'Connor in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Egan, 68, will be installed as the ninth archbishop of New York
on June 19, moving from a relatively obscure diocese with 360,000
Catholics in 88 parishes to the nation's most visible Catholic see,
with 2.4 million Catholics in 413 parishes.
</P>
<P>
   Egan's appointment was one of the worst-kept secrets in recent
Vatican history _ within hours of O'Connor's death May 3 priests in
Boston were hearing from their New York colleagues that Egan was
the pope's choice. The pope made the announcement less than 60
hours after O'Connor's burial Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at Cathedral High School on Manhattan's
East Side, Egan appeared jovial, bantering with reporters. He
referred to a New York Times religion reporter as ``young lady,''
twice told Hispanic reporters ``I love your music,'' and joked
about the high salary of NBC employees.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a black cassock and a pectoral cross, Egan answered
questions in English and Italian, made comments in Spanish, smiled
as he fielded potentially prickly questions about Hillary Rodham
Clinton and Rudolph Giuliani, enthusiastically affirmed his
opposition to abortion and birth-control for teenagers, and ducked
a question about gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you I know no place in the world that is quicker to
accept someone who wants to be a New Yorker,'' he said. ``And I
want to be a New Yorker.'' He said his first goal would be to get
to know priests of New York, saying that success is achieved in
parishes.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Egan prayed and greeted worshipers at St.
Patrick's Cathedral, the seat of the archdiocese of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Egan seems to have the perfect resume for New York. He became
close to Pope John Paul II during 22 years as a canon lawyer and
judge at the Vatican, he got to know New York as an auxiliary
bishop there in the 1980s, and he has run a diocese since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   In Bridgeport, Egan is credited with saving a struggling
Catholic school system by replacing the parish-based system with
regional schools.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics in Bridgeport say Egan is charismatic in person and
dynamic at the pulpit. He is also a talented pianist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's perfect for that job because he knows how to reach out
and talk to people and put them at ease,'' said Ed Byrne, 17, who
worked with Egan as an altar boy. ``He also has a really good sense
of humor. He's going to be missed (in Bridgeport), but I think they
really need someone like him in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony J. Cernera, president of Sacred Heart University in
Fairfield, Conn., said Egan is a passionate intellectual,
comfortable discussing quantum physics as well as theology.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very bright man,'' Cernera said. ``The issues in New
York are tough issues, but he's a tough guy. He'll work hard to
understand the issues and put together a game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before last week's speculation, Egan was seen as an
up-and-comer in the church hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know this would come sooner or later, because he's really
overqualifed for here,'' said the Rev. Matthew Bernelli of St.
Mary's in Bridgeport.
</P>
<P>
   Egan's sharpest critics are lawyers representing 21 people who
claim they were victims of sexual abuse by priests employed by the
diocese of Bridgeport. All but one of the instances of alleged
abuse took place before Egan arrived in Bridgeport _ some of the
allegations are 30 years old _ but the allegations have been
litigated on his watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should have offered his support, his apology, an
investigation, and counseling to the victims, and he has not done
any of that,'' said Jason E. Tremont, a lawyer representing the
alleged victims. ``Instead, the tactic has been to delay the
proceedings, to prevent any information from becoming public, and
we believe there's been a coverup _ that he had knowledge of sexual
abusers and let them continue on as active priests, including
having contact with other children.''
</P>
<P>
   Egan's spokesman, Tom Drohan, rejected the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you are dealing with here are the representations of
plaintiffs' counsel that is distorted, unfair to the facts, and
transparent in that...they are just trying to try their cases in
the paper,'' Drohan said. ``Now the facts: The bishop has condemned
this kind of behavior, or alleged behavior, on a number of
occasions, and these lawyers know it and so does the Connecticut
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Drohan said priests accused of sexual abuse have been
transferred to other parishes only after psychiatric evaluation and
``doctors told us it would be appropriate to put them back in an
area where they can practice their ministry.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Catholics hoping for changes in church policies on
the ordination of women, homosexuality, and other controversial
issues saw little reason for encouragement in Egan's selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is seen as a papal loyalist, and our general sense has been
that his position and statements on homosexuality have emphasized
the immorality of genital activity,'' said Marianne T. Duddy,
executive director of Dignity/USA, an organization of gay
Catholics. ``We had begun a dialogue with Cardinal O'Connor in the
last couple years and found it productive, and we would hope that
Bishop Egan would be open to the same kind of dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Bernard F. Law of Boston declined to be interviewed,
but issued a statement congratulating Egan, saying he ``has been a
good shepherd and gentle father of the flock in Bridgeport. I know
that he will bring those same fine priestly and episcopal qualities
to the archdiocese of New York.''

   EUROPE-ECONOMY (Undated) _ The newly-won star status of the
European entrepreneur, and the crushing burden of Big Government.
The lure of the nimble American economic model, and the strengths
of European multiculturalism. The unifying force of the euro, and
lingering obstacles to a truly single European market. Those were
some of the puzzle pieces on the table one evening early this month
when the chief executives of six fast-growing companies gathered at
the Hotel de Crillon in Paris to talk with New York Times' European
business correspondents about the challenges facing European
business. By John Tagliabue.

   ACCOUNTING-HIJINKS (Undated) _ Earnings reports have been coming
in rosier than ever in the first quarter of 2000, up approximately
20 percent from the same period last year. As a result, many market
strategists believe that stocks will soon resume their upward
climb. But at the same time that corporations have been reporting
impressive numbers, there is a growing concern among some
accounting professionals that many companies are relying on
financial alchemy to burnish their results. By Gretchen Morgenson.

   BIZ-DEFENSE (Undated) _ Fearing a national monopoly in the
military aircraft business, the Pentagon is now rethinking a
decision to award a $200 billion jet fighter contract, the largest
in its history, to a single company. The Pentagon's ``winner take
all'' competition has pitted Lockheed Martin against Boeing in what
was once seen as a bold effort to bring commercial practices to the
Defense Department. But now the government fears that the nation
could be left with only a single supplier as it begins to build the
next-generation fighter jets, the Joint Strike Fighters, which will
replace aging F-16's and other planes. By Leslie Wayne.

IRISHMAN'S FIND ENDS 21-YEAR ODDYSEY OF BOTTLE WITH MESSAGE

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a storybook idea, culled from books and beachcombing days
and idyllic Nantucket summers. In early September of 1979, Amy
Turano and Valerie Wozniak _ 13-year-old friends who had read about
messages in bottles _ decided they wanted to send one of their own.
</P>
<P>
   They threw a bottle in the surf, but it kept rolling back
ashore. So Amy's father suggested they drop it, instead, from the
ferry to Hyannis, Mass., deep into Nantucket Sound.
</P>
<P>
   This one came back, too. Twenty-one years later.
</P>
<P>
   The green wine bottle, which the girls had filled with notes and
sealed with wax, rolled onto the beach of Derrymore, Ireland, this
March, tossed by currents that could have carried it from Britain
to the Equator and back. It was sitting on the high-tide mark,
covered with kelp and shells. When Michael Wall first saw it, he
walked right by.
</P>
<P>
   Wall, 48, an avid fisherman with four children and four dogs,
works in a cattle feed mill nearby. The beach is his regular haunt,
and bottles are commonplace. But when he walked by this one again,
with his golden retriever, he noticed paper inside. He picked it up
and took it home.
</P>
<P>
   By the time his wife and daughter came in, he had broken the
bottle _ the only way he could get it open. He found a letter
inside, with a date and time: 1 p.m., September 2, 1979. And a
request: please fill out an accompanying note and mail it to one of
the girls. There were two addresses listed, both in Colchester,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do not send the note back,'' the message went on,
``just put these papers back in the bottle and throw it in the
ocean. Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Wall was 27, living in the same town, working at the
same mill. Valerie Wozniak and Amy Turano were Connecticut girls on
the brink of adolescence. Those days, the Turanos rented a cottage
on Nantucket Island for couple of weeks each summer, and allowed
their son and daughter to invite friends along.
</P>
<P>
   That year, the kids had read a story about a boy who sent a
message in a bottle and made a new friend, said Amy Turano _ now
Amy Thurber. They were inspired to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Andrew Turano, a pediatrician with a logical mind,
didn't have much hope for the plan. ``Children have imaginations
and they read stories,'' he said. ``You know how skeptical parents
are.''
</P>
<P>
   So he told them their odds of success were low, but he helped
them, anyway, sealing the bottle and selecting the drop-off point,
midway between Nantucket and Hyannis. Based on his knowledge of
currents, he said, ``I figured if it ever landed anywhere, it would
land on the British Isles.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, the girls leaned over the ferry railing on a
cloudy day and watched the bottle disappear. They talked about it
for a year or two, Thurber said, but ``it definitely was out of my
mind for a very long time.'' In the intervening years, the girls
graduated from high school together and slowly drifted apart.
</P>
<P>
   Thurber went to the Rhode Island School of Design, married,
divorced, and married again. She is now 34, a graphic designer and
illustrator, living in South Dartmouth, Mass. with her husband and
three-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   The girls _ now women _ haven't spoken in years, though their
parents still live in the same neighborhood in Colchester, half a
mile apart.
</P>
<P>
   It was to those parents' homes that Wall sent his response,
along with a copy of his local newspaper, which had written a story
about his remarkable find.
</P>
<P>
   Another local man recently found a message in a bottle some ten
miles off, Wall said in a telephone interview from his home
Thursday, but it had only been in the water for a year or two. This
one was special _ ``a long journey, you know,'' he said.
``Everybody's been asking me since.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, his newfound friends across the Atlantic hope he'll come to
the United States someday; Thurber would like to invite him
fishing. She also wants to take her son, Benjamin, to Nantucket,
where she hopes he'll pass the days as she did: catching firefiles,
feeding birds, walking the beach, making summer wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she said, her family isn't finished with its ocean
dreams. Her brother Paul, now 31, dropped a bottle of his own on
the same September day, 21 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He's still waiting to hear where it lands.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In a discovery with profound implications for the study of early
human history, scientists in the country of Georgia have found 1.7
million-year-old fossilized human skulls that show clear signs of
African ancestry and may represent the species that first migrated
out of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The two relatively complete skulls, being described in Friday's
issue of the journal Science, begin to put a face, in a sense, to
the ancestors who responsed to opportunity and necessity by leaving
Africa and spreading over much of the world. Many
paleoanthropologists hailed the discovery as a major advance and
probably the most ancient undisputed human fossils outside Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first good physical evidence we have of the identity
of the first emigrants out of Africa,'' said Dr. Ian Tattersall, a
paleontologist and evolutionary biologist at the American Museum of
Natural History in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The international discovery team, led by Dr. Leo Gabunia of the
Georgia National Academy of Sciences, concluded that the age and
skeletal characteristics of the skulls link them to the early human
species Homo ergaster, a species that lived from 1.9 million to 1.4
million years ago and some researchers think is the African version
of Homo erectus. The specimens were said to bear less resemblance
to the typical Asian Homo erectus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suggest that these hominids may represent the species that
initially dispersed from Africa and from which the Asian branch of
H. erectus was derived,'' the discoverers said in their report.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the findings contradicted the once widely held
theory that human ancestors picked up and left Africa soon after
they invented better stone axes and other tools of what
archaeologists call the Acheulean culture. The more than 1,000
stone tools found in the sediments with the two skulls were all
pre-Acheulean, crudely chipped cobbles that had been made since
human ancestors began knapping stone tools about 2.5 million years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest tools of the Acheulean style did not appear in
Africa until 1.6 million years ago, and about 100,000 years later
outside Africa, in Israel. By contrast, the discovery team
reported, the tools found with the Georgian skulls resembled tools
found in the Olduvai Gorge of Tanzania and dated at about 1.8
million years.
</P>
<P>
   So it was not technology, but biology or environment, that
presumably set human ancestors off on their migrations, scientists
now say.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Susan C. Anton, a University of Florida paleoanthropologist
on the discovery team, said that by this time human ancestors had
become more carnivorous and their diets pushed them to expand their
range to match the wider ranges of the animals they preyed on.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the appearance of Homo, we see bigger bodies that require
more energy to run, and therefore need these higher quality sources
of protein as fuel,'' Anton said of the adaptation to meat-rich
diets.
</P>
<P>
   As long as early human ancestors had smaller bodies and brains,
Tattersall said, they lived mainly on plants and confined
themselves to a limited range at the edge of forests, not too deep
in or too far out on the savanna. Once they had stronger bodies and
high-protein meat diets, they were able to spread out
geographically and ecologically.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alan Walker, a paleoanthropologist at Pennsylvania State
University who specializes in human fossil hunting in Kenya, said
he agreed with the interpretation of the Georgian skulls. ``The new
fossils look exactly like early Homo skulls from Kenya,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said the implications for human dispersal from Africa
supported an idea he and his wife, the anthropologist Dr. Pat
Shipman, proposed in 1989. They suggested that once the more
apelike australopithecines evolved into the genus Homo and became
carnivorous, they were forced to expand their home territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Herbivores are restricted to where the plants are that they
eat,'' Walker said. ``Carnivores are not so restricted. Meat is
meat, and you often have to travel far to find it.''
</P>
<P>
   The two skulls were uncovered last summer at Dmanisi, on a slope
of the Caucasus Mountains 55 miles southwest of the Georgian
capital of Tbilisi. At the same site in 1991, paleontologists had
found a jawbone of what was identified as a Homo erectus. Finding
the craniums _ one of a young adult male and the other of a female
adolescent _ has seemed to quiet the skeptics who had disputed the
jawbone dating.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery team included scientists from Germany, France and
the United States, as well as Georgia. Dr. Carl C. Swisher III of
the Berkeley Geochronology Center in California determined the
approximate age of the skulls by geochemical and paleomagnetic
analysis of the sediments and the presence of small rodent bones of
a well-established age that were found with the human fossils.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Philip Rightmire, a specialist in Homo erectus at the State
University of New York at Binghamton, said he was impressed by the
discovery's implications for ``a pretty quick, really wholesale
dispersal of these people, along with other animals,'' from the
time the new species emerged in East Africa. There is some fossil
evidence that by the time the individuals to which the Dmanisi
skulls belonged were living in Georgia, others of their species had
already traveled as far east as Java.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some scientists, Rightmire classifies the African
ergaster with the Asian erectus in the same species. To him and
many others, they are regional variants of the same species. Other
scientists, often referred to as ``splitters'' and including
discoverers of the Georgian skulls, look at the same fossils and
see distinct species in Africa and Asia, with the Dmanisi fossils
much more closely related to its African roots.
</P>
<P>
   In their report, the discoverers said, ``The Dmanisi site
suggests a rapid dispersal from Africa into the Caucasus via the
Levantine corridor, apparently followed by a much later
colonization of adjacent European areas.''
</P>
<P>
   It was somewhat surprising, the discoverers said, to find that
the Dmanisi fossils bore so little similarity to the later European
lineages. Being close to the boundary between Europe and Asia,
Georgia might have been a crossroads of dispersal to the west in
Europe as well as to southern Asia and eastern Asia. Scientists
said the discovery left unchanged current interpretations of the
origin of anatomically modern humans in Africa some 100,000 years
ago.

DELL BEATS EXPECTATIONS BY 3 CENTS AS EARNINGS RISE 21 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dell Computer (DELL:Nasdaq), the largest direct vendor of
computers in the world, reported a 21 percent increase in its
first-quarter earnings Thursday that beat Wall Street's
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The company also overcame its previous warnings of flat sales
for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended April 28, net income rose to $525 million,
or 19 cents a diluted share, from $434 million, or 16 cents a share
a year earlier, beating by 3 cents the consensus estimate of
analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for the Round Rock, Texas-based company rose 31 percent,
to $7.3 billion, from $5.5 billion in the 1999 first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Dell, the second-largest maker of personal computers, had warned
back in February that sales in the first quarter would not be
significantly higher than fourth-quarter sales because many
businesses decided to refrain from buying computers for fear of
problems related to the Year 2000 transition. In addition, there
were worries about component shortages. But in fact, Dell posted
sales in the first quarter that were 7 percent higher than sales in
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The company did not disclose any clues regarding two issues
which have been of great concern to investors: the outlook for
component shortages and component demand.
</P>
<P>
   But overall sales of enterprise-class computer systems increased
52 percent and comprised 18 percent of system net revenues, up from
16 percent a year ago. ``They did very well in their enterprise
segment, so it appears that corporate demand is picking up,'' said
Art Russell, senior technology analyst at Edward Jones. ``We knew
March would be strong, but would it continue into April? From
looking at these numbers, I would say yes, they did continue.'' He
rates Dell a strong buy and his firm has done no underwriting for
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Dell also said that an improved product mix together with
lower-than-expected costs for key components helped the company
make investments in its Internet strategy and lift net margins from
fourth-quarter levels. ``That tells me that the component cost
environment moderated,'' Russell added.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Dell closed Thursday regular trading down 3/16, or
0.42 percent, at 44 11/16. In post-market activity, the shares were
up 3 1/16, or 7 percent, to 47 3/4, according to Island ECN.

XEROX CEO QUITS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN VAMES   
 c. 2000 TheStreet.com/N.Y. Times.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rick Thoman, chief executive of struggling Xerox (XRX:NYSE),
quit under pressure from the company's board Thursday, only 13
months after he took the postion.
</P>
<P>
   Thoman, who has been widely blamed by shareholders for Xerox's
sluggishness to move into high-tech digital imaging products, will
be replaced by Paul Allaire, the company's chairman and former
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Following early reports of Thoman's departure, shares of
Stamford, Conn.-based Xerox fell 2 points, or 7.3 percent, to close
at 25 1/2. The company formally announced the move after the stock
market close, and the stock recovered slightly in after-hours
trading, rising to 25 3/4, according to Instinet.
</P>
<P>
   In his first stint as chief executive, Allaire had hand-picked
Thoman, then chief operating officer of IBM(IBM:NYSE), to be
president and chief operating officer of Xerox in June 1997. After
working closely and prepping Thoman for the position, Allaire named
him chief executive in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Xerox has been troubled by falling sales and
profits, and its share price has fallen by roughly half. From its
high near 64 in May 1999, it started falling when the company's
earnings fell short of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, the company reported a first-quarter loss of $243
million and announced it would cut 5,200 jobs and shut down plants
at a cost of $625 million. It was the second restructuring in two
years. The first restructuring, announced by Allaire in November
1998, cost $1.1 billion and resulted in 9,000 layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are dealing with situations like low stock prices and
heavy restructuring efforts, and things aren't going quite as
planned, it's easy to get feathers ruffled. Its quite possible that
there just wasn't enough patience in the organization to see if
Thoman's turnaround efforts would work,'' said Gregory Gieber,
analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co. He rates the stock a
long-term buy and a short-term neutral.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to brief reporters and analysts about its
management reshuffling in a conference call Friday morning at 8:30
a.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   Thoman's efforts with Xerox involved trying to push the No. 1
copier maker into markets for both home and office digital
products, pitting it against old copier rivals, such as Japan's
Mita, and home-imaging equipment makers such as Hewlett
Packard(HWP:NYSE).
</P>
<P>
   Along with his cost-cutting efforts and a push toward digital
home and office equipment, Thoman also worked to revamp the
company's sales force, trying to shake the image of stereotypical
copier salesmen in polyester suits in favor of forming a sales
force versed in high-technology digital products.
</P>
<P>
   But his efforts seemed to fall short of Allaire's expectations.
``We are grateful for Rick's contributions in leading the company
through a period of major repositioning,'' Allaire said in a
release. ``However, both Rick and the board felt it best for the
company to move forward with an experienced Xerox team that will
lead Xerox people and efficiently execute the strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Xerox separately promoted Anne M. Mulcahy to become the
company's new president and chief operating officer and elected her
to the board of the company. Mulcahy, a 24-year employee of Xerox,
most recently served as president of the company's general markets
operations.

RUSSIAN PRESS FREEDOM WEAKENS AMID GOVERNMENT PRESSURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV AND BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In what looked to many like a crackdown on freedom of
the press, heavily armed and masked security forces Thursday raided
the offices of a prominent Russian media company that has been
critical of Russia's newly sworn-in president, Vladimir V. Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of investigators and tax police backed by S.W.A.T. units
broke down doors and forced their way into the three central Moscow
offices of Media-most, which owns a national television network as
well as a radio station, a newspaper, and two magazines. The agents
detained and interrogated company employees and spent 12 hours
searching the premises as taciturn masked men wearing flak jackets
and brandishing submachine guns guarded the entrances outside.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Media-most charged the raid was designed to stop
criticism of the government and discourage journalists from probing
alleged Kremlin corruption. Russian politicians across the spectrum
from Communists to liberals joined Media-most executives in
condemning the raids as an ominous sign for press freedoms, coming
as it did just four days after Putin was inaugurated.
</P>
<P>
   The security agents and investigators who took part in the raids
refused to identify themselves or talk to journalists. Phones
inside the building were cut off and mobile phones confiscated.
Later in the day, the employees were allowed to go home, and late
Thursday evening, masked men carried boxes, apparently containing
confiscated materials, out of the building and putting them in a
truck.
</P>
<P>
   While the actual motivation for the raids remained the subject
of speculation, they reinforced the notion that due process in
Russia is subject to whims of political power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is insulting that a few days after a new president of
Russia took office, a president with whom many people in Russia
link a rebirth of the country, it seems as if everything is going
backwards,'' Media-most Chairman Vladimir Gusinsky told his
flagship television station, NTV.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who was meeting CNN founder Ted Turner in the Kremlin as
the raids took place Thursday morning, did not comment on the
events at Media-most. Some analysts suggested that the true motive
for the raids was a vicious behind-the-scenes battle for influence
among Kremlin insiders, including a powerful coterie associated
with financier and media baron Boris Berezovsky.
</P>
<P>
   One Putin administration official suggested that the president
himself had been taken by suprise, which appeared to have been
sanctioned by Russia's acting prosecutor, Vladimir Ustinov, and the
Kremlin's chief of administration, Alexander Voloshin, both of whom
are considered Berezovsky allies.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday evening, a limousine bearing the presidential standard
and accompanied by a heavy security detail entered the grounds of
the Kremlin hospital where Putin's predecessor, Boris N. Yeltsin,
spent much of his second term. But there was no indication from the
Kremlin whether Putin had been hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Putin's promises to uphold democratic freedoms, the
raids were likely to fuel concerns that the former career KGB
officer could reverse the country's newly won rights. A document
leaked to the press last week outlined plans to crack down on
political opponents using the Federal Security Service, the
domestic successor of the former Soviet secret police, which is
known in Russia as the FSB.
</P>
<P>
   Chief FSB spokesman Alexander Zdanovich denied any political
motivation for the raids, saying they were the result of a criminal
investigation into whether employees with Media-most's security
department had disclosed bank secrets and violated privacy laws.
</P>
<P>
   Zdanovich said the company's security agents had illegally
listened in on phone calls and conversations, including those of
Media-most's journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human rights observers' hair would stand on end if they found
out someone else was doing this,'' Zdanovich said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, had a different interpretation. He said Berezovsky had
long wanted to settle old scores with his rival Gusinsky, and at
the same time wanted to put pressure on Putin to name Berezovsky's
allies to his new government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin was set up,'' he said. ``If he says he didn't know this
was going to happen, then what kind of president does that make
him? But if he goes along with it, everyone will know he is a
puppet. . . . And Putin himself has long wanted to get rid of
Media-most. So how can he go against this?''
</P>
<P>
   Newscasters at NTV speculated on air that the search may have
been triggered by a recent article in the company's newspaper,
Segodnya, that alleged wrongdoing by a high-ranking official in the
FSB. Segodnya editor Mikhail Berger said in an interview on the
station that the official, deputy FSB director Yury Zaovstrovtsev,
had taken part in the raids.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the motivation, the raids managed to unite Russia's
usually divisive political factions. Communist leader Gennady
Zyuganov and prominent liberal Sergei Kiriyenko both denounced the
use of force, while former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
criticized what he called a ``provocation against the independent
media.''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, freedom of the press in Russia is still on shaky
ground. Media-most's journalists have never been free to report
whatever they want; Gusinsky, like the heads of most Russian media
companies, influences coverage in accordance with his own political
agenda. In 1996, he united with Berezovsky to publicly back
Yeltsin's reelection bid, and some of his media outlets responded
with unabashedly pro-Kremlin coverage of the election.
</P>
<P>
   But of late, Gusinsky has fallen out with the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   In December's parliamentary elections, NTV television supported
a political party that was openly hostile to the Kremlin. And in
contrast to Russia's state-controlled television channels, NTV
reported critically on Putin's presidential campaign, while giving
positive coverage to opposition candidates like liberal economist
Grigory Yavlinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Media-most publications have also been critical of the war in
Chechnya. Some media observers here say the Kremlin has waged a
campaign to discredit coverage that emphasizes the negative aspects
of Russia's efforts to take control of Chechnya, including
arresting journalists and harassing publications that veer from the
official line.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin earlier attempted to pressure Media-most by calling
in loans the company had taken from politically-connected banks and
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Gusinsky tried to sell a bank he founded, called
most-Bank, in order to pay off a $211.6 million to Russia's natural
gas monopoly Gazprom. Media-most officials said that the deal, to
sell most-Bank to the state-owned Vneshtorgbank, was called off
after Voloshin intervened.
</P>
<P>
   About the only politician who applauded the raids was flamboyant
ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who welcomed it as a sign
that the secret services are taking charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The KGB has come to power, and Russia needs it,'' Zhirinovsky
said. ``Searches and arrests will happen almost on a daily basis.''

   The former commander, Ekrem Rexha, who was known as Commander
Drini, received a military funeral on Thursday, with uniformed
soldiers laying wreaths and offering a gun salute at his grave. In
his hometown of Prizren, businesses closed as thousands of people
filed past his coffin in the biggest display of public solidarity
seen since the end of Kosovo's war.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pain for all of the city of Prizren, a pain that all
of Kosovo feels,'' Gen. Agim Ceku, former commander of the Kosovo
Liberation Army and and now chief of its civilian successor, the
Kosovo Protection Corps, said in a speech at the graveside. ``To
kill a legendary commander on his doorstep, is not only a crime
against a hero, but against all the people who have already
sacrificed so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand people gathered on a hillside in Landovica,
several miles outside Prizren to bury Drini among other soldiers of
the Kosovo Liberation Army. Red flags of Albania, bearing the black
eagle, flew at half staff as former soldiers and villagers stood on
top of trucks to catch a glimpse of the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who did this, did it against the KLA, against
freedom and against the future of Kosovo,'' Ceku said. Also present
was a former commander turned politician, Ramush Haradinaj, who was
a friend of Drini and had reportedly approached him to join his
newly formed coalition of political parties. Clearly upset,
Haradinaj declined to comment on the slaying, and drove away, alone
but for his bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   Drini's death brings to 23 the number of Kosovo Liberation Army
members killed since the end of the war in June. The deaths have
come as a result of internal score-settling, business disagreements
or, increasingly, political rivalry. The grass-roots guerrilla
movement always had a varied following, but the shootouts between
former comrades-in-arms has shocked many people in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of its concern, the U.N. mission in Kosovo ordered
some 30 police officers to investigate. But Drini's family doubts
that the killer or killers will be found.
</P>
<P>
   Without naming anyone in particular, Ceku said opponents of a
liberal, stable and prosperous Kosovo were behind the killing, and
he implied that those who were against Kosovo Albanians' bid for
independence were involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a vision of what should be done after the war,'' he
said. ``In Kosovo there are still forces that are working against
Kosovo's freedom. They could not stop the freedom for which Drini
fought, now they are trying to stop the development.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future of Kosovo cannot be built on murders and an absence
of security. Nobody is going to allow this, because it is against
the aspirations of our war, the ideal and the efforts Drini made.''
</P>
<P>
   Drini's family was more direct. They had received threats
recently, his brother, Nazim Rexha, said. He said he was sure that
the killing was not personal or business-related, but a political
attack on the moderate values of the former commander.
</P>
<P>
   Just back from seven years working in England, Rexha spoke more
freely than his relatives. ``They were intimidated lately,'' he
said of his family. ``I do not know by whom, but probably by people
who do not want to see a democratic state being formed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Drini was only guilty of one thing, of being clever,'' he
said. ``In Kosovo apparently we are only taught to be led and not
to lead. It seems somebody minds someone who can lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Drini's potential as a political leader may have been his
downfall. At 38, he was a professional soldier and former officer
of the Communist-era Yugoslav Army, and he taught at a military
college in Sarajevo until 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Kosovo Liberation Army soon after the conflict
began in 1998 and was rapidly made commander of the Pashtrik
region, one of seven regional zones of the guerrilla group's war
against the Serbian military and police forces. He was promoted to
its general staff during the intense fighting of the three months
of the NATO bombing campaign, and was known for his leadership and
organizational ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and Ceku and a few others helped professionalize the
general staff during a critical time,'' a Western diplomat who knew
Drini said. ``They brought a lot of stability to the general staff
when the KLA was close to falling apart in the first weeks when
they were really being pounded. I think he provided some real
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke seven languages and was widely liked and respected by
military and U.N. officials. After the end of the war in June, he
left the guerrilla group and joined the local administration in
Prizren as an environment and safety officer.
</P>
<P>
   He was killed at 8:15 a.m. on Tuesday as he left for work. As he
bent to change a flat tire, a gunman shot him eight times in the
body and once, at close range, in the head. As he fell to the
street, dropping his keys, his wife, who is the mother of his
10-month-old baby, and seven-months pregnant with their second
child, rushed from the house to his side, according to a witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have killed my husband,'' she screamed to her neighbor,
who recounted the moments to a reporter. ``She kept screaming `Wake
up, wake up, we have a son and another on the way.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Since the shooting, violence has flared in the area. An American
peacekeeping soldier was wounded and required stitches after Serbs
attacked military policemen investigating an explosion in the
village of Vrbovac in southern Kosovo.

 &HT;    Sex-shifted viewpoint pays off
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walter Sorrells' gender change has really paid off. After years
of attempting to sell his male-oriented mysteries, Sorrells created
a female sleuth _ Sunny Childs _ and began writing under the
pseudonym Ruth Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   The series became a hit, and last week the Atlanta writer was
honored by his colleagues with the Edgar Award for Best Paperback
Original for ``Fulton County Blues'' (Berkley, $5.99). In addition,
he has been nominated for a Shamus Award, given by the Private Eye
Writers of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning the Edgar for best paperback is kind of like being
named Most Valuable Player in the minor leagues,'' he said. ``It
means you have a good chance at making it in the big leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Set in Atlanta, ``Fulton County Blues'' follows Sunny on an
investigation into the death of her late father's friend, a Vietnam
War veteran. Along the way she uncovers clues that indicate her
father may not have been the hero she thought he was.
</P>
<P>
   Writing from the perspective of a woman has been fun, Sorrells
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've found is that the worst thing I can do as a writer
is to write about a 38-year-old white guy from Atlanta. I think I'm
a simple person, and simple people are not interesting to write
about.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sorrells' next book, due out in September, Sunny Childs will
return to investigate the murder of a Shania Twain-type country
music singer in Floyd County.
</P>
<P>
   Sorrells is trying to sell another novel written under his own
name, but he plans to keep writing the Sunny Childs series and to
learn as much as he can about being a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use my wife to check things sometimes, but not that much.
She did catch a big bra-size gaffe that I made. I didn't know my
bra sizes and I had someone wearing a 33B. Apparently they only
have even numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Good reviews: Not only has British author Nick Hornby gotten
good reviews for his novel ``High Fidelity,'' but he's also landed
a job with The New Yorker as a pop music critic.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorker editor David Remnick hired Hornby after seeing his
review of Steely Dan's ``Two Against Nature'' album. Hornby's first
regular review _ of Aimee Mann's ``Bachelor No. 2'' _ will appear
next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorker had been without a pop music critic since
Elizabeth Wurtzel left to write her memoir, ``Prozac Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Rewarding Toni: You would think that Oprah Winfrey would
spread some of her literary influence around to writers who could
use a break. But her latest choice for her TV book club selection
is ``The Bluest Eye'' by Toni Morrison. This is the third time the
Nobel Prize winner's books have been spotlighted. The first two
were ``Paradise'' and ``Song of Solomon.'' Knopf has already gone
to press with 175,000 additional hardback copies, and Plume is
printing another 575,000 paperbacks.

 &HT;    Feds say illegal deal has boosted prices, especially for hot
discs
 &HT;    By Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The feds say compact disc prices may drop ``significantly'' by
the end of the year as the result of an anti-trust settlement with
major record distributors.
</P>
<P>
   But major retailers were in no-comment mode Thursday. So it was
unclear just how much money CD buyers stand to save.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission said music companies had forced
retailers into an illegal arrangement that cost CD buyers an
estimated $480 million between 1997 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Under the arrangement, retailers who participated in
co-operative advertising with distributors had to keep their prices
above certain specified levels. They were penalized by music
distributors if they sold their discs too cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   Distributors initiated the arrangement to help music retailers
who were being undercut by discount stores and electronics chains,
such as Target, Circuit City and Best Buy.
</P>
<P>
   Later, with discounters reined in, distributors themselves were
able to raise their wholesale prices, the FTC charged.
</P>
<P>
   From 1997 to '99, the average price for advertised CDs rose $3,
according to FTC spokesman Eric London.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't say that price increase was all related to the
illegal marketing program,'' said London, ``or how much it will
lower prices, or when. But we hope there will be some kind of
significant drop.''
</P>
<P>
   By one measure, the settlement's effect seems slight. The $480
million overcharge amounts to just 19 cents per CD, for all the
discs shipped over the past three years. But the FTC's action
mostly affects highly advertised new releases, which could fall by
much more than 19 cents.
</P>
<P>
   In the music retail business, prices are as unpredictable as the
next hot CD. Prices range widely from artist to artist, CD to CD,
store to store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our prices range from $14.98 to $18.98,'' said Richard
Kuykendall, manager of Wuxtry, an independent music store in
Decatur, ``but you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Kuykendall said after Santana's album
``Supernatural'' became a hit last year, Arista raised its
suggested retail price.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC agreement is with the five largest music companies,
which distribute 85 percent of the CDs in the United States: Time
Warner, Sony, Universal, EMI and Bertelsmann.
</P>
<P>
   According to the FTC, the agreement will not affect on-line CD
sellers such as Amazon.com and cdnow.com, because they do not take
part in co-op advertising. But an executive with Amazon.com told
the The Wall Street Journal that the illegal arrangement had in
fact forced the on-line retailer to raise some prices.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement's demise, said Amazon's Jennifer Cast, ``gives
us additional freedom to price what we think is appropriate.''

 &HT;    Florida park expands its musical direction
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIVE OAK, Fla. _ In the beginning, there was bluegrass.
</P>
<P>
   When Bill and Jean Cornett of Kentucky first opened Spirit of
the Suwannee Music Park here in 1985, they had plenty of pickin'
and grinnin' in mind. Longtime bluegrass fans and founders of the
27-year-old Festival of the Bluegrass in Lexington, the Cornetts
wanted a year-round, pastoral home for their musical passions.
</P>
<P>
   They found it on this oak-shaded parcel of land on the banks of
the Suwannee River. The Cornetts discovered the 600-acre park, then
an abandoned campground, in the early 1980s on one of their yearly
trips south during the cold-weather months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like everybody else north of Atlanta _ we have to go to
Florida in the winter,'' Jean quips.
</P>
<P>
   One look at the grassy central meadow (perfect for staging
concerts), the towering, moss-draped live oaks and the
slow-as-molasses flow of the Suwannee, and they were hooked. ``I
believe Mother Nature is a powerful force, and I could feel it all
around me,'' Jean, 71, remembers. She coined the park's motto,
``Music lives here,'' on that visit.
</P>
<P>
   That music, and much more, will certainly live over Memorial
Day, when the park hosts a family-oriented blowout with s'more
roasting, storytelling, sing-alongs and face-painting. Many
visitors will divide their time between park activities and the
Florida Folk Festival in nearby White Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Others will head straight for the pickin' sheds.
</P>
<P>
   In these rustic pavilions, dozens, sometimes hundreds, of
amateur players gather for impromptu jams. Fueled by hot bluegrass
licks, down-home camaraderie and, occasionally, beer, these jams
are a vital part of the music culture that has taken root here.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, the Cornetts lured Lexington festivalgoers
with two nights of free camping. Word spread among bluegrass fans,
and soon kindred spirits were pouring in from all over the United
States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Today, legions of the bluegrass faithful gather for festivals _
the Suwannee Springfest in March and the smaller Spring Bluegrass
Festival in April drew 15,000 and 3,000. And plenty of them bring
their own instruments along.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you have to do is get people in here, and there'll be
pickin','' says the Cornetts' 38-year-old son, James, who took over
park operations three years ago. He estimates that, on festival
weekends, as many as 50 percent of the park's guests are musicians.
</P>
<P>
   And you don't have to pick a banjo or bow a fiddle, either. ``It
doesn't matter if you play the tuba, go ahead and bring it,'' says
Charley Chase, a bluegrass fan from Michigan. Chase, 68, owns one
of the park's 12 permanent cabins _ his is the one embossed on the
front with a fiddle and mandolin. Chase is one of the few regulars
who doesn't play an instrument, but he does sell CDs by Bill
Monroe, Flatt &AMP; Scruggs, the Carter Family and others at festivals.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, however, the rural rhythms heard here have been
accompanied by a chorus of new sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, the park has blossomed into a multiuse
campground that hosts events of all stripes, from blues concerts
(B.B. King played last fall) to hot-air balloon races, a
Renaissance festival, auto shows and hippie-rock weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with Memorial Day weekend, this summer promises to be
the park's busiest yet. There's a gospel jubilee in June, a huge
garage sale in August, fireworks celebrations on July Fourth and
Labor Day and another bluegrass festival in late September. And
James Cornett says he's hoping to bring the jam-rock showcase
Furthur Festival here in early September.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the everyday attractions. A 30-mile web of sandy
horse trails snakes through the dense forest that lines the
Suwannee; bring your own steed or rent one at the park's stable,
which also offers riding lessons. A miniature golf course set back
in the trees draws putters of all ages, and there's a canoe rental
outpost for folks who want to get out on the river.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of campsites are scattered throughout, from
roughing-it plots to full-service RV sites with water, sewer,
electricity and cable TV hookups.
</P>
<P>
   There are also rental cabins and _ the park's swankiest digs _ a
375-square-foot ``treehouse'' that sits 12 feet off the ground in a
copse of oaks and palms. It's equipped with kitchen, bathroom and
loft.
</P>
<P>
   The something-for-everyone strategy appears to be working: The
park drew more than 300,000 visitors last year.
</P>
<P>
   A few loyalists at the Spring Bluegrass Festival expressed
concerns about the new diversity. ``They've let bluegrass slide,''
lamented Harry Bowen of Macclenny, Fla. The guitarist was showing
his purist pride _ jamming with three fellow musicians in ``the
Loop,'' a camping cul-de-sac popular with the pickers, on the train
anthem ``Steel Rails'' and other fave tunes.
</P>
<P>
   A North Florida Bluegrass Association member who has been coming
to the park since 1985, Bowen claims there are ``not near as many
(bluegrass events) as there used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   But, says Jean Cornett, ``It takes all kinds of music and all
kinds of people to make the world go 'round.'' And, she adds, to
make the park profitable.
</P>
<P>
   As long as they continue to lure new bluegrass fans such as Dell
and Bill Fowler, the music will still live here. The Crestview,
Fla., couple visited the park during the Spring Bluegrass Festival,
eager to see crowd pleasers White Sands and Blackwater. They
attended their first bluegrass festival last May in Elba, Ala., and
quickly climbed aboard the bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   Bill, 71, thought the park was ``one of the nicest places we've
been,'' and Dell, 60, was charmed by the hospitality of her fellow
campers. ``You meet these people, and it's like you've known them
your entire life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many regulars pitch in with park maintenance. ``We have one
fellow from West Virginia who showed up with a chain saw one day
and did most of the trail clearing,'' Jean Cornett says. Others
help out by building picnic tables, making signs and doing
electrical work.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the campers have created not only an inviting
temporary home, but a lasting bond. ``A lot of us are older, and

 &HT;    Paul Hemphill feels the sting of the South
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, May 14.
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of the most precious memories from Paul Hemphill's
youth is a battered old Rawlings baseball glove from his brief
career in the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta writer bought it for $15 in 1954 on his way to
spring training in Panama City, Fla. Before he could try it out,
coach Eddie Miller took a razor blade and sliced away the top layer
of the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said I needed to feel the ball,'' Hemphill said one recent
afternoon at his suburban Atlanta home as he slipped the battered
glove onto his hand. ``He said I needed to feel the sting.''
</P>
<P>
   Putting the glove back in its place of honor in his writing
office _ just above his stash of Camels and just below a stunning
earth-tone oil portrait of his late father _ Hemphill shakes his
head at the reminder of what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a good fielder, but I couldn't hit,'' Hemphill says.
Tall and lean, with a face as weathered as the glove, the
64-year-old Birmingham native speaks in a deep Southern voice as
deliberate as a slow-moving Alabama river.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, I went to Auburn and flunked every engineering
course I took. Then a kindly professor told me I had a way with
words, so I ended up in journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   As he moved from sportswriter to news columnist for The Atlanta
Journal to author of 12 books, Hemphill played the game like a kid
with only a thin layer of leather protecting his nerve endings.
</P>
<P>
   In his newspaper columns he wrote poignantly about young men
returning from Vietnam in a pine box. In his novel ``Long Gone,''
he wrote about old baseball players at the end of their careers and
young players at the beginning of theirs. In ``The Nashville
Sound'' he wrote about country musicians who made it and those who
didn't. And in ``King of the Road'' he wrote about his racist,
truck-driving father.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 Hemphill celebrated his 60th birthday by running around
the infield of the Daytona International Speedway to research
``Wheels,'' a book on stock car racing. A few years earlier, he
blew out his knee attempting to hike the Appalachian Trail with his
19-year-old son for a book titled ``Me and the Boy.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, Hemphill left his home in Atlanta and
moved into a dank fishing cabin in the Alabama swamps to research
``The Ballad of Little River'' (Viking, $25).
</P>
<P>
   Located near the setting for ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' Little
River is a community of about 200 people. The violence that erupted
there in 1997 fascinated Hemphill, who was interested in exploring
the state of race relations as well as getting a glimpse into the
lifestyles of the poor and infamous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd get up about daybreak at 6 and fix myself something to eat
and go down to Peanut Ferguson's store and pick up the Mobile
Register and then make my rounds,'' Hemphill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything went fine until the morning in August when I
awakened to find that two tires on my trusty old Blazer had been
punctured with an ice pick overnight,'' said Hemphill, who
suspected one of the men from a backwoods family that resented his
intrusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's going to be happy when the book comes out. Maybe some
of them will. But then, it's an unhappy book. Nobody can be happy
when a church burns down. It's still not rebuilt and probably never
will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Hemphill's unhappy conclusion is that while some things have
changed in Alabama and the South, other things have not.
</P>
<P>
   Still, says his friend and Auburn classmate Anne Rivers Siddons,
Hemphill has never stopped loving the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never seems to get calluses on his mind or his heart,''
said Siddons, who lives in Charleston. ``There's not a sentimental
bone in his body, but he never stopped feeling anger or surprise or
joy. He loves the South but he sees it pretty clearly. His was a
tough South. He grew up in Birmingham when there was very little to
rejoice about.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 1993 memoir, ``Leaving Birmingham,'' he recalled the
violence that tore apart his hometown in 1963, when police
commissioner Bull Conner ordered fire hoses and police dogs turned
loose on civil rights marchers.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades later, racial tensions still simmer in poor urban
neighborhoods and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the 1940s down there,'' Hemphill said. ``You leave
the interstate, it ain't changed. Forget, hell. They're out there
farming their land like their granddaddy did. They've got satellite
dishes, but they're not watching the right stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Race relations have improved somewhat, but what's happened is
that the poor _ both black and white _ have been shut off
economically. That's where the trouble is.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain, Hemphill added:
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not be signing copies of my book at Peanut Ferguson's
store or the Dixie Landing Cafe in Little River, and I'll be hiring
the retired black deputy sheriff Murray January as a bodyguard when
I go to Mobile.''

   &QR;  ``Jesus'' (9 p.m. Sunday on CBS, concluding 9 p.m. Wednesday)
</P>
<P>
   The third big TV take on Jesus this season (after NBC's ``Mary,
Mother of Jesus'' and ABC's ``The Miracle Maker'') is the best: a
rich, imaginative view with one of the most joyful Jesuses ever

Mary.

   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Worst Bet
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Rated X'' (9 p.m. Saturday on Showtime)
</P>
<P>
   This otherwise forgettable piece of flimsy sleaze has attracted
some attention because brothers Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez
play brothers Artie and Jim Mitchell (respectively), the San
Francisco porn kings of the 1970s whose claim to fame is having
made ``Behind the Green Door.'' And also because Sheen, who's newly
sober, had to pretend to snort a lot of cocaine and smoke a lot of
pot.
</P>
<P>
   If that's enough enticement for you, wade on in. ``Rated X'' has
plenty of sex, drugs and profanity, as you might expect. It also
has close to zero insight into the Mitchells and nothing
interesting to say about the milieu they helped create. Sheen and
Estevez, heads shaved and eyes blazing, are mildly interesting to
watch, but the writing isn't much better than the Mitchell
brothers' movies themselves.

MARCH BY MOMS COULD BOOST GUN CONTROL AS CAMPAIGN ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sunday's Million Mom March on the Mall has the
potential to be something much larger than either its one-day
numbers, emotional appeal, or hype suggest. If it succeeds in
pushing gun control high on the national agenda, it could help Al
Gore's bid for president and endanger congressional Republicans in
swing districts.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control has emerged as a big concern of women in this
election year, so potent an issue that some predict the march could
generate a new women's political movement around the issue and put
political candidates who don't support a host of gun-safety
measures on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gun-control issue is something that will really cut across
party lines,'' said GOP pollster Linda DiVall, noting that as a
single issue, gun control now is about twice as likely as abortion
to move women voters. And, she noted, Republicans have ``a lot more
conflict'' over the issue than Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush has been trying to woo
women because they have provided the margin of victory for the
Democrats in the last two presidential races. So far, he has had
success, polls show, but gun-control could be a problem for him,
particularly if it gains altitude as an issue. While Bush supports
mandatory trigger locks and raising the age of handgun possession
from 18 to 21, the Texas governor signed a measure last year that
makes it legal in the state to carry concealed handguns.
</P>
<P>
   His position is anathama to the gun-control lobby, and Handgun
Control Inc., an advocacy group, recently began running a 30-second
ad in seven cities that highlights Bush's record. The ad also
quotes an official of the National Rifle Association saying, ``If
we win, we'll have a president ... where we work out of their
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who favors a host of new gun regulations and has proposed
stiffer penalties for gun-related crimes, lately has been hammering
Bush on his ties to the NRA and the concealed-gun law. ``Will he
fight for the gun industry, or for America's families?'' the vice
president asked in a recent newspaper interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think gun control could become a campaign issue, for the
mere reason that there is a big gender gap, and if Al Gore has
learned anything from Bill Clinton, it's that he needs to do
something to appeal to women voters,'' said Dianne Bystrom,
director of the Carrie Chapman Catt Center for Women and Politics
at Iowa State University. ``This could be the issue, and it's one
where he can really draw distinctions with George Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Bystrom said that in the mid-1990s, pollsters started detecting
a split in how the sexes saw the crime issue. Men wanted harsher
punishment for perpetrators. Women, scared that they or their
families would be crime victims, sought more protection. Since the
massacre at Columbine High School and other incidences of school
violence, the fear factor has thrust gun safety to the top of the
women's agenda, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters say they have been stunned by the huge and widening
gender gap on gun control. A survey released Thursday by the Pew
Research Center found that 67 percent of the women and 46 percent
of men said gun control was more important than gun-owner's rights,
while 49 percent of men and 28 percent of women favored owner's
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are angry, and they want action,'' said Democratic
pollster Celinda Lake, an expert on women's voting behavior.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people tell pollsters they aren't sure more gun laws
will really make much difference, and they question how effectively
laws on the books are enforced. But that doesn't take into account
the very emotional nature of the gun debate, particularly for
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be a very dangerous issue, especially for suburban
Republicans, because it's very symbolic in defining a candidate,''
said Tony Fabrizio, a Republican political consultant. ``You might
be for trigger locks, or smart-gun technology, but if you won't say
you'll take guns away from people, then you get painted as an
extremist and pushed out of the mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens here on Mother's Day, at a march billed as
mainstream event, is important.
</P>
<P>
   Powerful images of a crowd as large as 150,000 _ mostly women,
some pushing baby strollers, many from the inner city, a few
victims of violence, a lot of them stereotyped soccer moms _ aim to
vex Capitol Hill's GOP leaders, who for a year have bottled up a
fairly modest bill to provide background checks on buyers at gun
shows.
</P>
<P>
   But the ambition of march founder Donna Dees-Thomases, a Short
Hills, N.J., mother and professional publicist, is much larger than
pending legislation. She wants Sunday's rhetoric and show of
solidarity to stir up grass-roots activism when the women go home
and to influence voting in presidential, congressional, and even
local contests in November.

   ``I'm not sure the march will move the bill (in Congress) next
week, but the Martin Luther King march didn't move the civil rights
bill the next week either,'' said David Rosenbloom, director of
Join Together, a team at the Boston University School of Public
Health that works on preventing gun violence and substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers are estimating a crowd of 150,000, which will feature
women victims of gun violence, celebrites such as Rosie O'Donnell
and Susan Sarandon, and politicians, including First Lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton and Maryland Lieutenant Governor Kathleen Townsend
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Near the Lincoln Memorial, a group called the Second Amendment
Sisters is expecting as many as 10,000 women to march Sunday on
behalf of the rights of Americans to bear arms. Debra Collins of
Aurora, Colo., a march coordinator, says she shares the same
concern as the Million Mom Marchers _ protecting herself and her
loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA, the gun-rights lobby, this week launched a ``Safe
Kids'' advertising campaign and committed $1 million to put a
gun-safety program in every American classroom.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the NRA has
donated $577,129 to congressional candidates and made $664,650 in
soft-money contributions to the Republican Party so far this
election cycle. The figures are higher than two years ago, and
reflect, some analysts say, the group's attempts to strengthen an
eroding position.

   PHOENIX - Ain't no doubt about it _ that dang Confederate flag
got no bidness flying up on top the Statehouse dome in South
Carolina. No bidness 'tall.
</P>
<P>
   Word is, they's civilized folks in South Carolina. What was they
thinking? By now they should of figgered out that no symbol of the
Confederacy belongs in a place where folks is all how-dee-do and
soft in the head from book learnin'.
</P>
<P>
   No sir.
</P>
<P>
   The Confederate flag is meant fer the ignernt. It needs to be
flying in a place where the men is slow, the women is ornery, and
the gubmint's dumber than a sack full a hammers.
</P>
<P>
   N'other words _ HERE.
</P>
<P>
   The Confederate flag has flown over the capital in South
Carolina since 1962 and wudda flown till hell froze over if a bunch
of agitators hadn't made folks over there nervous as a cow with a
buck-toothed calf.
</P>
<P>
   Fine, I suggest they mosey on out to Arizona. It's high time we
seen the Stars and Bars waving over the copper dome at the end of
Jefferson Street. Which we will be certain to rename Jefferson
Davis Street.
</P>
<P>
   It's perfect for us.
</P>
<P>
   Near as I can tell, Arizona's the onlyiest one of all the
U-nited States to have a legislator (goes by the name a Karen
Johnson) who tried to have a law passed this year saying we's
prepared to secede from the Union.
</P>
<P>
   If that ain't Confederate enough for you, we got just about the
highest dropout rate in the Union, and at the same time got just
about the highest number of schoolgirls who's currently in the
family way.
</P>
<P>
   About a year back, we was ranked by the squishy-headed liberals
at the Children's Rights Council as the third worst state in which
to raise a child. We took it as a compliment. Sort of like recently
being listed 45th among states in public school spending per
student.
</P>
<P>
   We got another legislator (goes by the name a Barbara Blewster)
who compared homosexuality to ``bestiality, human sacrifice and
cannibalism.''
</P>
<P>
   And that ain't all. A politician in town said Blewster told her
once that Native Americans ``were not smart enough to do what they
need to do to get ahead, and that even African-Americans are more
advanced than Native Americans, (and) smarter.''
</P>
<P>
   If that ain't a Dixie-singing patriot, what is?
</P>
<P>
   She also believes teachers and administrators should carry
weapons to school. And she ain't alone. We got politicians who was
hoping to allow pistol-packing patrons into any ole public
building, playground or park, and dern near got a law passed.
</P>
<P>
   If that don't jar your preserves, you should know that while our
politicians paid no mind to health care and education and such,
they made dawggone sure to pass a law likely to help the Arizona
Cardinals git a new stadium. As you know, they's nothin' more
important than football.
</P>
<P>
   And I wonder if South Carolina has heard tell that folks in
parts of Arizona don't take kindly to furiners. Down near the
border, they's likely to point the business end of a shotgun at 'em
lest they high-tail it outta there.
</P>
<P>
   It'd be right nice to be waving our very own Confederate flag at
special occasions like that, hollerin' our new state motto:
</P>
<P>
   Y'all don't come back now, hear? &QL;

THOSE ONSCREEN CRITTERS ARE REALLY THINKING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes, all that work on basic technology research ends up
paying off in wonderful, and wonderfully unexpected, ways. Take
artificial intelligence (AI), where researchers have toiled for 30
years trying to figure out how to make computers think like humans
do.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, researchers were doing interesting work with tiny
computer-generated creatures that were programmed with a handful of
basic rules and turned loose onscreen to see how they would behave.
</P>
<P>
   The results were startling. AI-driven ``birds,'' for instance,
were given simple rules like avoiding each other and objects in
their flight path. Lo and behold, they would then generate
startlingly birdlike flocking behaviors such as flocking together.
</P>
<P>
   Now flash forward to Hollywood, where such rules-based AI has
been incorporated in animation software to help create, in
relatively painless fashion, complex scenes like the wildebeest
stampede in ``The Lion King'' and the Huns' charge in ``Mulan,''
without the painstaking frame-by-frame work of a human animator.
</P>
<P>
   Those techniques were relatively simple, though, compared with
what's being done as part of the ongoing filming of the three-movie
``Lord of the Rings'' in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   To portray two huge battles in the trilogy, director Peter
Jackson and his special-effects company developed software that
governs the behavior of hundreds of thousands of computer-generated
orcs, elves, humans and dwarves, said Mark Ordesky, the Fine Line
Pictures president who is overseeing the films' production.
</P>
<P>
   Using AI techniques, the computer creatures are each given
offensive and defensive actions characteristic of their species.
The creatures then will be set loose on each other with the
computer ``cameras'' recording the action. The AI is sophisticated
enough so that when a creature ``kills'' an enemy; it knows enough
to move on to the next opponent, said Ordesky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really wild stuff,'' he said. You won't see the first
product of all this work until December of next year, however.
Sigh. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Whale of a time &QL; 
Making your own cassette tapes used to be the way people compiled
songs they liked, especially for friends or parties.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, CD ``burners'' that create custom CDs are getting
some notice, with Philips and other electronics manufacturers
offering audio-oriented dual drives that ease that process. And of
course, many computers these days come with CD-RW drives built in
that can do the same thing (as well as make backing up files a
breeze).
</P>
<P>
   But I'm looking forward to rewritable DVD drives, given their
huge capacity, as soon as two competing formats stabilize into one.
In the meantime, we're seeing lots of fun music-oriented DVDs
hitting the market, including a series from Palm Entertainment that
include discs of music videos about Bob Marley, Sly and Robbie, and
a collection of dance-oriented artists.
</P>
<P>
   And now comes word from Moby, the brilliant Grammy-nominated
electronica artist, that he's planning a DVD with ``the music
videos, B-sides, concert mixes'' on it. Speaking in a recent
Webchat interview on Wherehouse.com's ``The Lounge,'' Moby didn't
say when he'll be rolling out the disc, but expect it fairly soon.
</P>
<P>
   I expect more artists will take advantage of the medium because
it can hold so much material, up to a few hours' worth. Another
great musician and producer, Todd Rundgren, told me he expects the
next big push in music will be to remix albums to take advantage of
the 5.1-channel sound that is part of the basic specifications for
DVD and home theater.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, what used to be called CustomDisc.com has changed
its name to imix.com as it begins offering not only custom-made CDs
online but also custom-made DVDs.
</P>
<P>
   Imix has tens of thousands of music tracks that people can
purchase for the custom-made CDs, and recently added music videos
for custom DVDs. Just this week, the company said it had cut a deal
with Beverly Wilshire Filmworks/Telefilms International to let
people compile film DVDs from about 100 movies of several kinds.
Imix says its discs can hold up to 180 minutes of film, about two
average movies' length. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Big fake dough &QL; 
Next time Time-Warner Cable pulls a bonehead move like dropping ABC
during ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' be prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, you could go get a satellite broadcast system, or a pair of
rabbit ears, both rational responses to an irrational move by the
entertainment giant. But that won't fix your immediate need to put
sweat-soaked information freaks on the hot seat.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, Buena Vista Interactive has just released the second
edition of its CD-ROM version of ``Millionaire,'' adding 600 more
questions and other odds and ends to what was a chart-topping first
edition. Even better, it works on Mac and Windows 95/98. Bad news:
The money you win in the computer game still isn't real. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Make a list &QL; 
One little side effect of the ability to split a high-definition TV
signal into three or more standard-definition broadcasts is some
serious confusion for the companies that provide TV listings, said
KCET's Laurel Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've called a couple of the services and asked what they were
going to do and they said `I don't know,''' Lambert said. They have
to figure out how to show the multicasting, which typically will be
done in daytime and other off-peak hours, and the high-def
broadcasts done in prime time. And even if a station isn't
multicasting, it may show very different programs sometimes on its
digital and analog channels. &QL;

COMPANIES TO SLASH COST OF AIDS DRUGS TO THIRD WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ Under increasing pressure from the Clinton
administration and African leaders, five of the world's largest
pharmaceutical companies announced Thursday that they would make
their AIDS drugs affordable for tens of millions of people across
the Southern Hemisphere who have the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Unveiling the joint agreement, the United Nations in Geneva said
the companies would slash the price of their AIDS drugs by as much
as 90 percent of what Americans pay.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials in South Africa, struggling to cope with one of
the highest rates of HIV infection in the world, reacted with
cautious optimism to Thursday's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would welcome anything that brings the price of these drugs
down, but I would like to see more details of their offer,'' said
James McIntyre, the chief AIDS researcher and medical doctor at
Bharagwanath hospital in Soweto, the sprawling township south of
Johannesburg. ``If the companies are just doing this to protect
their intellectual property rights, it will be a waste of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement could mark the beginning of a rapprochement
between the drug firms and African governments long embittered by
what they saw as efforts by powerful Western multinationals to
exploit Africa's epidemic for profit. Some 23 million people south
of the Saharan desert have the human immunodeficiency virus,
according to the United Nations, and AIDS kills more than 2 million
Africans annually. At current prices, anti-retroviral treatments
are prohibitively expensive for even the best African budgets.
</P>
<P>
   But even with lower costs, regional experts said, much more was
needed before the drugs could be made widely available in poorer
countries that lack the expertise and infrastructure to administer
complicated treatment regimens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need significant new funding that is on a level with the
enormous human, social and economic challenges now being imposed by
the epidemic,'' said Peter Piot, executive director of UNAIDS, the
joint UN program responding to the epidemic globally. ``Lowering
the prices of medicines, however, is only one critical factor in
what must become a much broader and more urgent effort.''
</P>
<P>
   The five companies announcing the price cuts were Britain's
Glaxo Wellcome, Bristol-Myers Squibb of New York, Germany's
Boehringer Ingelheim, the Swiss firm Roche, and Merck and Co. of
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Glaxo, which manufactures the joint treatment of AZT and 3TC
called Combivir, said it would reduce the price of the daily
regimen from $16.50, the figure in the United States, to $2 in
developing countries. Ugandans currently pay about $6 per day for
the treatment. AZT, international studies show, can reduce the risk
of infection from pregnant mother to fetus by as much as 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which follows an urgent appeal by UN Secretary General
Kofi Annan last December, involves the World Health Organization,
the World Bank, the UN Children's Fund, and the UN Population Fund.
The next step, according to officials from these agencies, is to
work out a plan for how the drugs will be purchased, distributed,
and administered. That scheme will be announced at the upcoming
international conference on AIDS in Durban, South Africa, in July.
</P>
<P>
   One scenario, according to Christopher Lovelace, director of
health, nutrition, and population at the World Bank in Washington,
is for the Bank to offer low-maintenance loans to African
countries. UNICEF would then purchase the drugs from the companies.
</P>
<P>
   WHO, meanwhile, might be involved in training health officials
on how to administer the drugs, which can be dangerous or rendered
ineffective if not taken correctly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a country wishes to take advantage of these reduced prices,
the Bank would certainly consider supporting those countries,''
Lovelace said. ``It is hard for us to imagine a situation where
there was a well-conceived national strategy, a government request
to borrow, and we wouldn't support it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lovelace said a country with a per capita income of less than
$1,000 might receive loans at no interest.
</P>
<P>
   With as much as 25 percent of their adult populations infected
with HIV, African countries have been struggling for years to find
affordable responses to the AIDS epidemic. Despite some recent
concessions _ Bristol-Myers Squibb last year announced it would
donate $100 million over five years to help African countries
combat AIDS _ the pharmaceutical companies have not responded
willingly to demands for lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, President Clinton issued an executive order
relaxing US protection of intellectual property rights held by drug
companies, thereby allowing African governments more leeway in
obtaining cheaper generic alternatives to the name-brand drugs.
Congress earlier rejected an almost identical provision from an
African trade bill, which pharmaceutical companies had fought
strongly against.
</P>
<P>
   Annan applauded Clinton's decision. ``There has been a
controversy for some time as to whether or not African countries
who have the capacity to produce locally generic versions of some
of these drugs at a much cheaper cost will be allowed to do that,''
he said. ``I think the executive order is an important step in the
fight against AIDS . . . on two fronts: prevention and treatment.''

THE LEGACY IN THE FILE CABINET 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, May 14) 
 MARILYN KENNEDY MELIA    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Money is one of the boundaries of intimacy. A tangle of unspoken
social conventions makes it perfectly acceptable to complain about
the cost of something but taboo to compare that price with your
weekly salary. Similarly, we can pass along a winning stock tip but
must keep quiet about the value of our brokerage account. That is
why we blush if a friend breaks with custom and trusts us with a
financial confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Between parents and children, even when the relationship is
close, the sharing of private, money-related issues can be a rare
event. Parents might admonish us to save more and spend less, or
ask us what our job pays, but they typically are close-mouthed
about their own balance sheets. Most adults I know don't have any
familiarity with their parents' finances while their parents are
alive. It is not until after their deaths that we, as their
children, are left to explore this aspect of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   When my father died three years ago, it was my job to decipher
what his holdings were and how my mother should budget for herself
in her new status as a widow. Never interested in money (except for
being a careful comparison shopper), my mother asked me to sort out
these baffling questions for her.
</P>
<P>
   For many of us time-pressed boomers, adding parent-related
duties to our already burdened schedules is enough to break the
fragile balancing act; that is why so many people hand over such
work to the professionals. Though I could have asked my mother to
hire an accountant or financial planner, I'm glad I didn't. The job
turned out not to be burdensome at all, but a true labor of love.
Stepping into Dad's den was like opening a window on his world.
</P>
<P>
   During the last couple of years of his life, my father stopped
working as a consultant and spent a sizable portion of his time
tending to his investments. He was an industrial engineer in his
professional life, so I wasn't surprised by the meticulous charts
he kept, showing the movements of his stock holdings. He had neatly
labeled files for his bank and brokerage statements and a few notes
on his stock selections.
</P>
<P>
   He did not leave behind any other personal writings, like a
diary, so these seemingly dull notes became precious to me. Others
have told me that even stumbling upon a grocery list or a voice on
an answering machine that belonged to a loved one who has suddenly
been lost can bring a rush of joy and excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Sorting out his financial affairs brought me those feelings, and
more. Learning how much he earned the year he retired, or how he
had contributed so diligently to his company's savings plan for
years, brought me newfound respect for his role as our family's
provider. I knew, too, when I found a sheet that inventoried his
assets, that he probably meant that as a message to me of where to
look, what to find.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at his desk, I tried to imitate his patience and abandon
my usual hurry-up, get-it-done style. In one file, I stumbled
across a series of letters he wrote to his employer's benefits
department and his brokerage firm. It appears that his entire
savings account became temporarily lost somewhere in cyberspace
when it was electronically transferred. Anyone else would have been
screaming into the phone. He had to be screaming inwardly, but his
letters politely demanded a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   His financial acumen was equally inspiring. Looking through his
records was tangible proof that stock investing pays off over the
long term. I enjoy helping my mother monitor the portfolio he
assembled, not only because I have been able to learn a few things
but also because watching his selections provides me with a
continuing link to him. When I hear the business reports, I
silently say, ``Dad, I can't believe you had the foresight to buy
AOL when you did.'' Or: ``I wish you could advise me. Is the market
overvalued?''
</P>
<P>
   Now, when my husband and I drop our bank statements into the
family files, I think how one day, our sons will probably be
tidying up financial loose ends that we leave behind. For the first
time, they will have an up-close, objective look at our
extravagances, our thrift and, I hope, our savvy. More than the
dollars we leave them to inherit, a more meaningful legacy lies in
those basement files.

`YOU DON'T ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR': `PRIVATIZED' DOESN'T MEAN
PERFECT 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, May 14) 
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Privatization has been one of the most durable buzzwords of the
post-Reagan era.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, the term means selling off state-owned companies that
provide private-sector services like telecommunications, oil
production and air travel. But in America, it means letting
private-sector companies provide traditionally public services like
fire protection, prison supervision and road maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   The domestic enthusiasts of privatization seem to believe that
if you want a job done right, you must ask the private sector to do
it. As a result, they ignore every modern example of private-sector
incompetence from New Coke to ``Ishtar.'' Is there much difference,
after all, between the Defense Department paying $600 for an
ordinary toilet seat and a private-sector corporation paying $600 a
share for an Internet start-up with no assets, no profits and no
plan for producing either?
</P>
<P>
   Before they bubble over with giddy, rich-kid ideas like letting
Federal Express take over the local post office, they should sit
quietly in a corner and read Elliott Sclar's new book, ``You Don't
Always Get What You Pay For: The Economics of Privatization,'' a
Century Foundation book just published by Cornell University Press
($25).
</P>
<P>
   The author, described on the book jacket as ``an economist by
training,'' teaches urban planning at Columbia University. His book
offers a refreshing dose of common sense, even if the clammy jargon
of organizational theory sometimes clouds his arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its subtitle, the book is really about the management of
public services. With breathtaking clarity, Sclar reminds us that
today's privatization is nothing more than a fancy label for
yesterday's public contracting, a gloriously rapacious activity
made famous by the likes of Boss Tweed.
</P>
<P>
   But as this book demonstrates with one delicious and
well-documented example after another, you don't have to be corrupt
to botch public contracting. Being dumb will do nicely. Just being
dogmatic and unimaginative will suffice.
</P>
<P>
   When state highway maintenance in Massachusetts was gradually
privatized, nobody accounted accurately for the state's continuing
overhead expenses. Nor did contract language specifically
anticipate what could go wrong; it did not, for example, say litter
should be collected before, not after, the grass was mowed. As a
result, the author notes, ``there is no way of ever knowing whether
or not privatization added value for the citizens of the
Commonwealth.''
</P>
<P>
   His message is that privatization is not and never will be an
adequate substitute for good public management. Whether you call
them privatization plans or public contracts, they must be artfully
drawn, intelligently monitored and then measured against accurate
internal costs to ensure that the public's interest is protected in
the pursuit of profit.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the privatization experiment of the Metro-Dade Transit
Agency in the 1980s. As Sclar tells it, the agency hired a private
company to run 10 of its bus routes, keeping 10 comparable routes
in public operation as a control group.
</P>
<P>
   But the contracts were silent about equipment maintenance. When
the experiment was abandoned after 18 months _ complaints had more
than doubled on the routes with private-sector service, and
ridership plummeted _ the new equipment that the agency provided to
the bus contractor had been so poorly maintained that only 10 of 40
new buses could be kept in service.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Sclar points out that ``most public contracting takes
place in markets that range from no competition (monopoly) to
minimal competition among very few firms (oligopoly).'' In such
markets, the invisible hand cannot be relied upon to protect the
public's interests.
</P>
<P>
   Even where markets are initially competitive, they may not be
cheaper than a smart in-house operation. When Fort Lauderdale,
Fla., considered privatizing its sewer pipe-laying in the early
1990s, contractors prepared bids as high as $130 a linear foot. But
city engineers did a careful cost analysis (a rare occurrence among
privatization practitioners, apparently) and found that the city's
in-house cost could be cut to as low as $43 if the work were better
organized. The contractors promptly cut their bids to $52 to $60 _
and still could not compete with a reorganized city service.
</P>
<P>
   But the wisest lesson that Sclar offers is that poorly managed
privatization can collide with important public values.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Westchester (N.Y.) County officials privatized
parking services at the county medical center, parking fees rose
beyond the reach of the families of poor patients. Only then did
officials realize, he said, that there was more to running a
hospital parking lot than making money.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a mutual aid pact among several small-town fire
departments in the county was tested to the breaking point when one
of the towns hired a for-profit corporation to provide its fire
protection service. The corporation kept smaller crews on each
shift than the surrounding nonprofit fire companies did, increasing
the extent to which the town relied on its neighbors for
reinforcements. One day, the reinforcements did not show up, he
said, and a $1 million private home burned to the ground,
fortunately with no loss of life.
</P>
<P>
   His wise and useful book is flawed by academic jargon _ someone
should simply take pruning shears to the fifth chapter, ``All in
the System: Organizational Theories and Public Contracting.'' There
are a few very minor but unfortunate errors that will cheer the
professor's critics _ the name of a Salomon Smith Barney
predecessor, for example, is slightly garbled.
</P>
<P>
   But on balance, his examples and his analysis _ and most of all,
his plea for sensible attention to good public management
techniques _ deserve wide notice. Even if politicians don't heed
his advice, taxpayers should.

SUIT TO TEST ONLINE FREE SPEECH RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Civil liberties groups backed a lawsuit filed Thursday against
Internet portal Yahoo Inc., in a case that may become a key test of
free speech rights online.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo runs some of the most popular Internet message boards
devoted to chat about publicly-traded stocks. In turn the messages
have prompted hundreds of legal complaints from companies charging
defamation or that anonymous authors have disclosed trade secrets
online.
</P>
<P>
   In these cases Yahoo, of Santa Clara, Calif., has routinely
identified its users in response to subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   But critics including the American Civil Liberties Union say
most of the suits are frivolous and aimed to quash dissent. They
say Yahoo should do more to protect the privacy of its user base,
or at least admit how fragile online-anonymity has become.
</P>
<P>
   Now these critics think they have a test case, filed Thursday in
federal district court in Los Angeles by an Ohio man who says he
was fired after being identified as the author of critical messages
about his bosses at the AnswerThink Consulting Group of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The former employee, who doesn't identify himself in his suit,
seeks damages of more than $75,000. Another aim is to prod Yahoo to
notify users when their identities are being sought, said
plaintiff's attorney Megan Gray, and give them a chance to respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because any lawyer can issue subpoenas without a judge's
approval or a court hearing, Yahoo users are more vulnerable to
corporate bullying tactics,'' said Gray, of the Baker &AMP; Hostetler
law firm in Los Angeles
</P>
<P>
   The suit is supported by the ACLU and the Electronic Privacy
Information Center, which say it is the first time Yahoo has been
sued over its disclosure policies.
</P>
<P>
   The case is only the the latest obstacle for Yahoo as it tries
to develop standards for its online communities, full of
notoriously anarchic chatter. Last fall Yahoo executives admitted
to removing controversial material posted on the chat boards,
sometimes even censoring messages before subjects complained.
</P>
<P>
   In March, in a filing to the Securities &AMP; Exchange Commission,
Yahoo also disclosed a review by the Federal Trade Commission ``to
determine whether we have complied with applicable FTC consumer
protection regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   A Yahoo spokeswoman Thursday declined to comment on the lawsuit
or on the FTC's actions, except to note the disclaimers Yahoo makes
in its terms of service statements to users.
</P>
<P>
   These state that ``Yahoo is committed to safeguarding your
privacy online'' but also that Yahoo may turn over data in cases
``when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Yahoo rivals America Online and Microsoft say they
notify their users when an identity is sought in civil suits,
giving users the chance to try to block frivolous demands for their
identities. Unlike those companies, Yahoo's services are free and
the company has indicated users shouldn't expect the same privacy
protections.
</P>
<P>
   The questions of just how much protection to afford anonymous
speech aren't new. But in the past they often related to political
matters such as the Federalist Papers, published unsigned in 1787.
</P>
<P>
   The content now in dispute is hardly as weighty. In the Los
Angeles case, the plaintiff identifies himself only as ``John Doe''
and chose the Yahoo screen name of ``Aquacool 2000'' after a
water-cooler in his office, Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gray and others, Aquacool wrote 30 messages to the
Yahoo message board devoted to AnswerThink over a five-month
period, about half of which were critical of the company. For
instance, Aquacool wrote that one of AnswerThink's managers ``is so
dull that a 5-watt bulb gives him a run for the money,'' according
to the lawsuit
</P>
<P>
   In response, AnswerThink filed a defamation lawsuit against
Aquacool and several other defendants in federal court in Miami,
and issued subpoenas to Yahoo seeking to learn the real identity of
authors; Gray said Yahoo gave her a copy of the subpoena of
Aquacool's identity, with which it complied.
</P>
<P>
   AnswerThink then filed a second suit against Aquacool
specifically, fired him and denied him compensation, according to
the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Aquacool admits his messages contained criticism and ridicule of
AnswerThink's management, but says they weren't defamatory. By
turning over his identity to AnswerThink, Yahoo violated his
privacy and First Amendment rights.
</P>
<P>
   At the least, the suit says, Yahoo should have notified him when
it received the subpoena. Instead, the suit says, Yahoo has
``consciously ignored such complaints for the sole purpose of
reaping profits for itself and placating the anger of companies
that are the subject of message-board criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, AnswerThink said that its actions ``were taken
to protect the company and its shareholders from a former employee
who was divulging confidential information on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   AnswerThink executives wouldn't say just what information was
confidential.

COMMENTARY: THE PARALLEL UNIVERSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Industrial Revolution came along it shaped the contours
of several U.S. elections. Although our current election comes at
the dawn of the information and biotech revolutions, you'd never
quite know it from the presidential campaign, which has been almost
a parallel universe, operating on its own news and historical
logic. It has been characterized either by the arcane _ the
Confederate flag and Bob Jones _ or by the evergreens _ Social
Security, campaign finance reform, abortion and gun control. There
is a general sense that not much is at stake in this election, and
that we have entered an era of good feelings and tiny differences.
</P>
<P>
   This is an illusion. My gut tells me that by 2008 we will look
back at the Clinton years as a fool's paradise _ the quiet
interlude after the Cold War and before all the forces unleashed by
e-commerce, the biotech revolution, the information revolution and
global integration reached their critical mass and ushered in a
period of radically new political choices and issues in U.S. and
global politics.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the headlines on the eve of this 2000 election: The
``love bug'' virus, launched by a student in the Philippines, wipes
out in a few hours millions of dollars' worth of files on 10
million computers all over the world. The next day we read that the
Internet is giving way to the Evernet, meaning that anything with
electricity is having chips embedded in it _ from pagers to
toasters to cars _ and connected to networks. The new Mercedes 500
has more computing power in it than the 747-200. Not only will this
mean that you will always be able to surf the Web everywhere, but
it is also going to mean that the Web will be able to surf you, and
know where you are, and what you are consuming, everywhere all the
time. And the faster and more diffused networks become, the more
vulnerable we all are, not to Big Brother but to the Little
Brothers _ the Web site, the video store, the hacker, the credit
card company that can amass and sell your personal data with little
government restraint. This is going to raise huge privacy issues.
</P>
<P>
   And if, as The New York Times reported Wednesday, ``Freenet''
technology really comes about it will be possible to acquire or
exchange any kind of digitized music, book, video, software or data
over the Internet, without paying any royalty to any publisher,
filmmaker or anyone. It could mean the end of copyright.
</P>
<P>
   The next day we read that we are soon going to have a single,
global 24-hour stock market. Regulated by whom? And the next day we
find that the 10-year project to decode the human genome, the
operating manual for how human beings are constructed, is about to
be completed, giving us the ability not only to cure disease in a
new way but also to design offspring and change human nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biotech revolution raises big moral issues that scream out
for international governance and a common agreement on rules,''
notes Francis Fukuyama, author of ``The End of History.'' We don't
want to just leave this to the market and have people designing
babies in the Cayman Islands, he adds, but there is no global means
to regulate this yet.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, what all these issues have in common is that we will all
be affected by these radical changes, and they can really only be
regulated through global institutions, but none exist today. We are
all increasingly connected, but nobody's quite in charge. And when
everyone is more tightly connected, but not everyone is more
tightly governed, small units can wreak large havoc _ the love bug.
Which is why this new era is going to actually demand more global
governance, not less. But how and in what form?
</P>
<P>
   These issues have not quite ripened into hard political choices
yet, so one can't fault the candidates for not discussing them
frontally. But as society is reshaped by these forces, and the
future becomes the present, this era of small differences will
burst right open.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we could have three debates this season. One would be
called ``Mudslinging,'' during which both candidates could unleash
any lie, exaggeration or personal attack against the other. The
next could be called ``Golden Oldies,'' which would focus on the
still relevant evergreens, from Social Security to abortion. And
lastly, we could have the ``Tomorrowland'' debate, in which each
candidate would have to present his thoughts on the new issues that
will actually be shaping his presidency before it's over.

EVEN IN SILICON VALLEY, KIDS WANT TO HAVE FUN 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, May 14) 
 By MATT RICHTEL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN CARLOS, Calif. _ David Roche is throwing it all away for a
slice of pizza.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't have any business plans for the future,'' he said,
looking bored.
</P>
<P>
   He had missed my point. Slightly annoyed, I tried again. ``Do
you have a business plan _ have you written down your business
ideas?''
</P>
<P>
   He thought for a moment. ``I do have a business paragraph,'' he
said, staring longingly at the tetherball court.
</P>
<P>
   David is 11.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, the nexus of a great technological and
get-rich-quick revolution, where opportunity flows like bottled
water at a health club, entrepreneurs are getting younger by the
day. A few have become millionaires before reaching 20. Busloads
are forgoing fraternity rush and heading directly to exit
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up here must give local children a terrific head start.
Just how young do they catch the entrepreneurial bug? I was off to
local elementary schools to find out.
</P>
<P>
   Astonishingly, plenty of children here are not with the program.
They seem entirely unobsessed with starting dot-coms, tracking the
Nasdaq or buying new Saabs. Perhaps I could straighten them out.
</P>
<P>
   David, a fifth grader at Arundel School, declared that he wanted
to be a fighter pilot or paleontologist. He said that writing his
``business paragraph'' _ a few sentences for a class assignment on
starting a business _ was not as much fun as tetherball or Pizza
Day at school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather go to the dentist,'' he said. ``I have a really
nice dentist.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked his classmates: Do you know who is more important than
the president, your parents and Barney combined? Blank stares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Venture capitalists,'' I reminded them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are they people who venture to different capitals,'' asked
Nicole Gordon, 11. ``I'd like to go to visit capitals like
Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   Teacher, doctor, naturalist _ what kind of dreams are those for
a new generation of digerati? Have they absorbed no values from
grown-ups around them who burn the midnight oil at dot-com jobs to
bring home piles of stock options that, before April 14 anyway,
could buy huge houses and BMW's? The kids, it seems, want to have
fun. Imagine!
</P>
<P>
   More depressing, they want it even though they have the
technology savvy to be the next Bill Gates. Witness: Brian Quiggle,
8, changed all the screen savers in the White Oaks Elementary
School computer lab to display logos of Yahoo, where his father
works. ``I said two things to him,'' reported Betty Casey, the
principal. ``One was `You can't do that.' The other was `How do we
take them off?'''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting with two classmates, Christopher Bertetta and Samantha
Robinson, Brian said he was not sure that he was ready to
capitalize on his computer skills. He was keen to show me a stick
he had whittled to a sharp point. He looked at two passing police
motorcycles and said, ``Cool.''
</P>
<P>
   I figured that this was my chance. I asked the three third
graders if they would be willing to quit school and start an
Internet company with me.
</P>
<P>
   I was hopeful at first. They all said that they thought the
Internet was neat and that they regularly used e-mail and surfed
the Web. Brian explained that the com in dot-com stands for
commercial, suggesting he was primed to quit thinking recess and
start thinking equity.
</P>
<P>
   But Christopher, who said he would rather be a rock star or a
cartoonist, was skeptical, muttering something about wanting an
education. ``If you promise I could be a multibillionaire, I'd
learn all that cruddy Internet stuff,'' he said. ``I'd do that or
start an amusement park, like Raging Waters and Great America put
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Samantha said she would prefer being a scientist or missionary.
She wants to help people. That sounded OK, I had to admit. Raging
Waters might be fun, too. Riding a roller-coaster must be easier on
the stomach than watching real-time stock quotations.
</P>
<P>
   Confused, I sat on a bench and talked to Jenny Pho. Her smile
was wider than San Francisco Bay. This girl has charisma, I
thought. I'll hire her as my chief executive!
</P>
<P>
   If I started a company, I asked her, would she be willing to run
it? I'd pay her gobs of money. ``Money's not that important,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   So what is most important? She thought deeply, displaying a
focus that any board of directors would appreciate. ``Friendship,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. Maybe net worth and workaholism aren't everything, I
thought. Maybe she's on to something. No doubt we'll grind it out
of her in high school. &QL;

 &HT;    Roberds' close-out sale to start next Friday
 &HT;    By Renee DeGross
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Roberds' liquidation sale at eight Georgia stores is
slated to start next Friday as part of the failed chain's
going-out-of-business plan, but customer orders are still in limbo.
</P>
<P>
   A bankruptcy court in Ohio will decide Monday which liquidation
firm will handle the close-out sale and how long it will last.
</P>
<P>
   The West Carrollton, Ohio, home furnishings and electronics
chain covered up its store windows with paper and shut down all
stores May 2, when it became evident its Chapter 11 reorganization
plan had failed.
</P>
<P>
   Roberds was unable to reach credit terms with major vendors. The
28-year-old chain closed distribution centers and stores in Ohio
and Georgia, cutting more than 1,300 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Customers with unfilled orders placed after Jan. 19 _ the day
Roberds filed for Chapter 11 protection _ will either get their
merchandise or a refund under a timetable to be determined by the
bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under bankruptcy code, the company is required to account for
all customers,'' said John Grigsby, chief financial officer and a
vice president of Roberds. ``We intend to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's in stock,'' Grigsby said, ``it will be sent for top
priority claims.''
</P>
<P>
   Top priority claims are any orders placed after the company
filed for bankruptcy protection. Orders placed before Jan. 19
``will take longer,'' Grigsby said.
</P>
<P>
   Customers getting merchandise repaired by Roberds or its vendors
will get their goods back, fixed or not, Grigsby said. The status
of extended service contracts will be dealt with in bankruptcy
court.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Cloud, spokesman for the Governor's Office of Consumer
Affairs in Atlanta, said he has fielded about a dozen calls from
Roberds customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are concerned about how they're going to get their
merchandise. Best thing you can do is refer them to bankruptcy
court,'' Cloud said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roberds has been around for decades,'' he added. ``This is not
a group that would defraud the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberds entered Atlanta in 1979 and slowly built up its presence
to eight locations in Georgia, a distribution center and service
center.
</P>
<P>
   Metro Atlanta was Roberds' biggest market, and the retailer had
planned to add at least three stores here this year. But Roberds
buckled under in the face of competition from Best Buy, Circuit
City and Atlanta-based Havertys, and the expansion of Rooms-to-Go.

CBS' THOROUGHLY MODERN MESSIAH 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jesus comes to TV in all forms. The less said about what ``South
Park'' did a year or two ago, the better. I wouldn't care to dwell
on the Claymation Jesus that ABC presented on Easter, either. And
NBC was a bit unclear on the concept with ``Mary, Mother of Jesus''
in November.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's CBS' turn, and that network's two-parter, ``Jesus,''
amounts to an Extremely New Revised Standard Version. In a delicate
balancing act, ``Jesus'' modernizes the Christian Messiah while
simultaneously placing him in historical context and honoring his
divinity.
</P>
<P>
   That is a risky exercise, but ``Jesus'' pulls it off splendidly.
Jeremy Sisto (``Without Limits,'' ``White Squall'') isn't the most
charismatic actor around, but he brings a physicality and human
emotional side to Jesus that's new, eye-opening and finally
stirring.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus is anything but ethereal in this story of his adult life
and ministry. He's seen reeling in fishing nets, dancing at a
wedding feast, joking with his disciples, displaying a short fuse
at times, mixing among and jesting with his congregants during the
Sermon on the Mount.
</P>
<P>
   In his days as a young carpenter, he's even on the verge of
pursuing a girlfriend, Mary of Bethany (Stefania Rocca). She's the
sister of Lazarus (Peter Gevisser), and she clearly aspires to be
Jesus' wife. Jesus kindly explains to her, at last, that he has
other plans.
</P>
<P>
   The producers readily admit that the implication of romance,
however unrealized, is a leap; Scripture grants a friendship and no
more. There's a leap, too, when Satan (Jeroen Krabbe, clad as a
sort of man about town in a black, modern suit) makes a second
attempt, after tempting Jesus in the wilderness, to subvert the
soon-to-be-crucified Jesus at Gethsemane.
</P>
<P>
   The scene is an invention, but the biblical scholars who
ratified the script went along with it. Showing Jesus a vision of
mankind's warlike future _ ``Killing for Christ will be a big
business in the future'' _ Satan tells Jesus that his impending
suffering will be in vain. Jesus holds firm. The scene owes more to
Dostoyevsky than to Scripture, but it's a fit, at least
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   The other narrative innovation concerns Pontius Pilate (slyly
played by Gary Oldman, the surest-handed actor in the production).
In the tricky business of assigning responsibility for Jesus'
execution, Pilate is squarely blamed.
</P>
<P>
   Suzette Couture's script has Pilate manipulating Herod Antipas
(Luca Barbarschi) and the Jewish high priest Caiaphas (Christian
Kohlund) into asking Rome to solve their Jesus problem.
</P>
<P>
   But here, Jesus is just as surely Rome's problem. In the brutal
yet mercifully brief crucifixion scene, when Jesus asks God to
``forgive them, for they know not what they do,'' a mumbled
rejoinder comes from a Roman witness, the invented character Livio
(G.W. Bailey).
</P>
<P>
   ``We know exactly what we're doing, Messiah,'' Livio says to
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed mostly in Morocco, ``Jesus'' features a wildly eclectic
cast from Italy, the United States, Britain, the Netherlands and
Germany. It's an Italian-American co-production, and it has already
shown its mettle in Italy, where it drew huge ratings in December.
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline Bisset, who played Joan of Arc's mother a year ago on
CBS, is Jesus' beatific mother, Mary. Armin Mueller-Stahl
(``Shine'') is Joseph, whose death triggers Jesus' ministry. Debra
Messing, far afield from ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' neither adds to nor
detracts from the show as the reformed prostitute Mary Magdalene.
</P>
<P>
   Sisto seems remarkably at ease in an understandably daunting
role. It helps him, no doubt, that the miniseries depicts a worldly
Jesus and that the script is in unadorned American English.
</P>
<P>
   There probably can never be a perfect actor as Jesus. Sisto's
handicaps include a less-than-commanding speaking voice. But he
uses his physical vitality to help compensate. His Jesus is a man
who takes a solid punch to each cheek, not merely an open-handed
smack; it's the manliest passivity you'll ever see.
</P>
<P>
   Director Roger Young allows some cheesy excesses. The electrical
charge that courses around Jesus at his baptism, for example, is
pure chintz. Also, some of the interior sets and backlighting are
too obvious. Hey, it's TV, after all.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Jesus'' is nevertheless a powerful experience and, as it
picks up steam, an energetic departure from most dried-out Biblical
epics.
</P>
<P>
   Its insistence on rooting Jesus in his humanity serves to
heighten the sense of dread over the crucifixion to come. And the
miraculousness of the resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   For the Christian audience, anyway, it's one network miniseries
whose sequel can be awaited with intense interest.

THE PENNEY'S PUSH TO SHED THE DOWDINESS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Vanessa Castagna, J.C. Penney's new executive vice president and
chief operating officer, is making demands again. At a summit
conference for suppliers Thursday at Penney's headquarters in
Plano, Texas, the imposing Castagna, who stands nearly 6 feet tall
in heels, strides backs and forth as she hammers away on what it
will take to turn around the ailing department store chain she now
runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got to be more timely, more current, and ship modern
merchandise that is trend-right,'' she tells them, demanding that
clothing suppliers provide more fashionable goods already priced on
hangers so that they can go right to the selling floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are asking more of them, requiring more of them,'' Castagna
explained in an interview after the meeting, ``and they love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Love, perhaps, is a tad strong, but certainly Castagna has
generated plenty of positive buzz since she jumped ship from
Wal-Mart Stores nine months ago. Fresh off the triumph of revamping
Wal-Mart's once-dowdy apparel section into one of its most
successful departments, Castagna is viewed as the kind of
results-oriented executive who can finally shake Penney's out of
its longstanding ennui.
</P>
<P>
   ``She focused on changes internally as well as externally,''
said Kim Roy, a group president at Liz Clairborne, who attended an
earlier conference for apparel makers. ``It really bodes well for
Penney's.''
</P>
<P>
   Already Castagna has demanded a slew of changes: everything from
giving her suppliers score cards to asking her store managers to
work on Saturdays. But no one underestimates the task before her.
</P>
<P>
   With a decentralized business culture that has left an unusual
amount of buying power in the hands of individual store managers,
Penney's has been slow to reach customers with up-to-date styles.
Its aging stores are overstocked with slow-selling, oddball
merchandise that makes them seem cluttered. And a tradition of
promoting only from within, left them bereft of top talent.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, while direct competitors like Kohl's and Target
have been growing at close to double-digit rates in recent years,
Penney's completely missed the late 1990s consumer spending spree.
On a year-over-year basis, the company's sales per store have
actually declined in all but 9 months of the last 28. Penney's
stock has lost more than two-thirds of its value in the last two
years, leaving investors fuming for change and making the company a
prime takeover target. Last week, in a filing with federal
regulators, Carl Icahn, the corporate raider, indicated that he was
purchasing Penney's stock and might take up to a 15 percent stake
in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn could simply be looking for a passive investment in a
company he thinks is undervalued or he might be considering a
takeover that would allow him to realize big profits by splitting
Penney's into its component parts.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Castagna has had to play a larger role as an
agent of change as other high-level executives have defected. And
the ultimate test could come soon. Just last week, James E.
Oesterreicher, Penney's chief executive and chairman, said that he
would step down and that a search for a replacement was under way.
Penney's said it would look both inside and outside the company to
fill the position, but Castagna is clearly one of the
front-runners.
</P>
<P>
   A 28-year veteran of the retail industry, Castagna is short on
financial and operations background but long on merchandising
talent. She had senior merchandising responsibilities at Lazarus, a
division of Federated Department Stores; at Target, the stylish
discounter; and at Marshall's. But Castagna is best known for her
work at Wal-Mart, where she became senior vice president and
general merchandising manager for women's apparel in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   At that time Wal-Mart's clothing assortment was of low quality
and poorly presented. Customers may have been happy to pick up a
bargain, like a decal T-shirt for $4.99, but they were skipping
over the higher-priced and more profitable sweater sets and jean
jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Castagna is widely credited with helping Wal-Mart clearly
identify a strong image for each of its clothing brands. She had a
keen eye for the one or two fashion items to promote. But just as
important was the structure she built for decision making.
</P>
<P>
   ``She created a process of planning,'' said Tom Burns, who
worked as a consultant to Wal-Mart when he was with the Doneger
Group. ``She created different teams for each brand. And she
created her own product development team that worked on identifying
trends.''
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart does not break out apparel sales in its financial
statements, but analysts say it is clear she helped both sales and
profitability. ``When Vanessa was there, food sales began to
increase at a rate of 30 to 40 percent a year due to Wal-Mart Super
Center expansion,'' said Jeffrey Feiner, a retail analyst with
Lehman Brothers. ``Yet at that time, apparel, as a percent of the
total, remained the same, which confirms the point that apparel
sales did well during her reign.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more critically, Castagna managed to adapt and thrive at
Wal-Mart, which, with its headquarters in the small town of
Bentonville, Ark., and a dearth of woman executives, is known for
its good ol' boy atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   She succeeded, colleagues say, because she is tough _ but in a
nice way. Known to work 100-hour weeks herself, Castagna demands a
lot of her staff but she also entrusts them with a high level of
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``She works through people very well,'' said Paul R. Charron,
chairman and chief executive of Liz Claiborne, which does business
with both Penney's and Wal-Mart. ``You won't see her taking over
meetings and usurping the prerogatives of a subordinate.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren D. Feldberg, who served as Castagna's boss at both Target
and Marshall's, echoes that view. ``She is a cheerleader,'' he
said. ``She describes it as putting on her pompoms.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Castagna is no shrinking violet. ``If you call her to see
how business is going,'' said Richard Baker, the chief executive of
sporting goods manufacturer Ocean Pacific and a long time business
friend, first ``she'll tell you how your business is going.''
</P>
<P>
   All her leadership skills will certainly be tested at Penney's,
which is famously insular and unresponsive. ``When the report card
comes in on Vanessa, she will have earned her `A' grade more for
what she was able to elicit from the J.C. Penney community than
what she did for suppliers,'' predicts Charron.
</P>
<P>
   Castagna has already started pushing internally just as hard as
she has been seeking external changes. Under her direction the
retailer has instituted a new compensation policy, making bonuses
more contingent on total company performance and less tied to the
gains of one division or store.
</P>
<P>
   At an April meeting with store managers, she zeroed in on the
contrast between Wal-Mart managers who take Tuesday and Wednesday
off and store managers at Penney's, who are often off on the busy
weekend shopping days. ``We have to have the best people being
there when the customers need them,'' she said firmly.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she is doing away with many of Penney's
traditional business practices. For example, Penney's had long
prided itself on a decentralized ordering system that allowed
individual store managers to make the bulk of the purchasing
decisions. Not long ago, the company moved to limit the autonomy of
store managers but Castagna wasn't satisfied. She recently demanded
that all ordering be centralized at headquarters to create a more
consistent image.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, Castagna has moved to improve Penney's dealings with
its suppliers. ``It has been our history that we did not share
information with suppliers,'' she explained. ``It was a contractual
relationship. We would say, `This is what Penney's wants.' ''
Castagna has tried to make that a more reciprocal relationship. As
of November, suppliers could monitor sales of any of their own
items at any store through a Web site Penney's established.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of her carrot-and-stick methods, Castagna announced that
Penney's would give suppliers score cards rating them on sales,
profits, swiftness of product turnover and other things. They will
also be able to see other suppliers' ratings, so they can gain
insight on the competition.
</P>
<P>
   In return for all this information, Castagna wants suppliers to
give Penney first crack at offering new products, to shorten
delivery times and to ship merchandise ``floor ready'' with hangers
and price tags in place. She also insists that the suppliers stop
giving Penney's their second-tier staff. ``We want people who can
analyze the business, not just salesmen,'' she explains.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably too early to see much improvement in sales, but
Penney's says inventory and related costs are already down
substantially. Castagna believes the seeds she has planted won't
bear real fruit until next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about remodeling a store, or changing a buying or
shipping mode,'' she says. ``We are changing the business model.''

ARCHBISHOP EGAN HAS A TOUGH ACT TO FOLLOW

<TEXT>
<P>
   The appointment of Edward M. Egan as the ninth Roman Catholic
archbishop of New York represents more than just the filling of an
ecclesiastical position; for the future of the city, it could be
the political event of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past century and a half, Egan's predecessors have
wielded enormous influence in local and national politics, far more
so than the holders of any other religious post. New York's
archbishops have often had more clout than senators or cabinet
members.
</P>
<P>
   Egan, 68, has spent 12 years as bishop of Bridgeport, Conn.,
where he led in fostering Catholic-Jewish relations and also
handled the delicate job of closing and merging several parishes;
in New York, he may be glad for the political skills those
experiences helped him develop.
</P>
<P>
   Egan's predecessor in New York, Cardinal John O'Connor, was a
master of the political give and take, and the turnout at his
funeral Monday rivaled that for a head of state. O'Connor was the
most recent in a long line of bishop-politicians that traces its
lineage to John Hughes, the combative working-class Irishman who
presided over the archdiocese from 1839 to 1864.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes led the New York church during a time when Catholics,
especially Irish Catholics, were regarded as an alien presence in
America. When Democrats ignored his requests in 1842 to curb the
blatantly anti-Catholic religious curriculum being taught in the
city schools, Hughes organized his own slate of candidates for the
state Legislature, took to the stump himself and swept the
election. Hughes was also a one-man anti-discrimination league,
standing up for Irish rights in public accommodations and hiring,
especially in the building trades.
</P>
<P>
   As Hughes consolidated his spiritual and temporal power in New
York, his national profile also rose. Presidents Franklin Pierce,
James Buchanan and Abraham Lincoln consulted with Hughes on the
issues of the day and occasionally called on him for diplomatic
missions. Lincoln even lobbied the Vatican, unsuccessfully, to make
Hughes a cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes' successors also wielded significant influence on
politics. Archbishop Michael Corrigan kept close ties to Tammany
Hall and in 1886 helped to mobilize Catholics against the mayoral
candidacy of the reformer Henry George. And Cardinal Patrick Hayes
used his Tammany connections to line up Democratic support in
Congress for legislation protecting church-run schools in the
Philippines in 1932.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Francis Spellman, who ran the diocese from 1939 to
1967, was considered the church's greatest politician and was
portrayed as close to Franklin D. Roosevelt, John Foster Dulles, J.
Edgar Hoover and important union leaders. Many Americans thought
Spellman had a real shot at becoming pope. The cardinal wasn't the
force he appeared to be in Cold War politics, and policy makers
considered him more of an irritant than an insider. He was ``always
pushing and pushing,'' according to Paul Nitze, an architect of
postwar foreign policy. Spellman was a supporter of Sen. Joseph
McCarthy, and he used his connections aggressively on behalf of
Catholic schools.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor succeeded best in updating Hughes' methods for the
media age. He was a master of turning adversaries into allies. Had
he not been a priest, it would have been easy to imagine O'Connor
as a senator or a governor.
</P>
<P>
   The real test for the new archbishop of New York is how well he
maintains the position's power. It has been decades since Catholics
voted as an identifiable bloc, and an archbishop's influence now
depends as much on charisma as on the inherent power of his office.
There are few bully pulpits to compare to the see of New York. Egan
has a very tough act to follow.

COMMENTARY: A WOMAN SCORNS 
</HEADLINE>
   By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If we accept Clinton-era conventional wisdom and assume that a
male politician's ability to survive a sex scandal depends on the
wife's willingness to impersonate a good sport, Rudy Giuliani has a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   After Giuliani told reporters this week that he and his wife,
Donna Hanover, were separating, Hanover held a press conference of
her own. A professional TV journalist, she didn't bury the lead:
``For several years it was difficult to participate in Rudy's
public life because of his relationship with one staff member.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be Cristyne Lategano, the mayor's former
communications director. Lategano and Giuliani always vigorously
denied having a romantic relationship, and after multitudinous
attempts to track down evidence to the contrary, the exhausted City
Hall press corps pretty much let the matter drop.
</P>
<P>
   Hanover, however, picked it back up again. She added that when
Lategano departed from City Hall last year, ``I made a major effort
to bring us back together,'' but that her husband ``chose another
path.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be Judith Nathan, a nurse whom Giuliani describes as
a ``very good friend.'' For a press conference that lasted only a
couple of minutes, Hanover managed to squeeze in quite a bit of
information.
</P>
<P>
   The ``good friend'' situation may be a private matter, but the
city really does have an interest in what Hanover said about the
mayor's ex-communications director. Lategano came to City Hall with
no strong qualifications except intense loyalty, and helped turn
the administration into a flock of low-profile yes-men and -women,
who encouraged the mayor's tendency to view the world as a war
between the forces of good (himself) and evil (anybody who gets in
the way). When she left, she used Giuliani's intense support to
snag a $150,000 job with the New York Convention and Visitors
Bureau. If this was all done in the name of love, inquiring minds
want to know.
</P>
<P>
   New York City is a pretty sophisticated place, but we have never
before heard a mayoral wife accuse her husband of fooling around.
Back in the 20's, Mayor Jimmy Walker carried on a very public
affair with a young British showgirl, but his missus didn't
complain and the press never mentioned it. A New York Telegraph
reporter once explained that he and his colleagues ``did not wish
to penalize the man for his lack of hypocrisy'' when tons of other
public men pretended to be faithful husbands while cavorting in
secret.
</P>
<P>
   That would be an example of the win-win school of political
philandering.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, right after the mayor announced that he was being
treated for prostate cancer, Hanover appeared ready to be
supportive. She even gave up a part in the Off Broadway show ``The
Vagina Monologues'' _ the sort of sacrifice only a New York City
Republican's wife would be capable of concocting.
</P>
<P>
   But it's pretty hard to stand by a man who appears intent on
bolting out the door. Hanover didn't really have much chance to
follow in the line of Hillary Clinton or Sen. Charles Robb's wife,
Lynda, who managed to pretend that she found that nude-massage
story believable. What Giuliani wants might be more of a friendly
ex-spouse _ somebody like John McCain's first wife, Carol, who took
the curse off his shabby behavior by issuing warm statements in
support of his presidential candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   So far, through two teary press conferences, Hanover has given
no indication she plans to let her husband off the hook. She used
to be a very public political wife, appearing in warm and fuzzy
campaign ads and confiding to a reporter that she felt her husband
was ``the most virile man ... so strong and wonderful.'' Then the
cone of silence descended, and the couple behaved like tenants in
an apartment building nodding vaguely to each other in the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few days the two of them have been confiding in us
quite a lot, really. It sometimes feels as if they're communicating
better with the press corps than with each other. Giuliani looked
ashen and shaky when he announced the separation, surprising not
only his constituents but apparently his wife as well. Thursday,
though, he appeared to be his old cranky self; you could tell he
was feeling better when he told one reporter to ``get lost.'' The
era of sharing, it seems, is over.

<P>
   As a million moms get set to march on behalf of gun control this
weekend, it's not clear how this issue will play in voter decisions
in the fall. The conventional wisdom has held for a long time that
while proponents of more restrictions on firearms outnumber
opponents, it's intensity that counts at the ballot box, and the
Second Amendment crowd has had a big edge there.
</P>
<P>
   For awhile at it looked as if the killings at Columbine High
School might change the political equation. In the months after the
tragedy, not only did polls find an increased number of Americans
favoring more restrictions, but there were indications that the
proponents of gun control were more intent than in the past. For
the first time ever, national polls were finding significant
numbers of respondents volunteering in open ended questions that
gun control was the top issue facing the country.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control looked like a tailor-made issue that Al Gore and the
Democrats could hit out of the park. In post-Columbine America,
George W. Bush seemed very vulnerable, having signed a
conceal-and-carry law in Texas, and having been identified by the
unpopular National Rifle Association as being a potentially
``friendly'' president.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, that's not what the polls are showing. Most surveys have
found about equal levels of confidence in the two candidates on gun
control. And a recent Gallup poll even found a 43 percent to 37
percent plurality thinking Bush would do the better job on this
issue. Two factors account for this unexpected result.
</P>
<P>
   First and most important is that while most people want more
controls, it is easy to overlook concern about gun owner rights.
Yes, with regard to handguns nine in 10 favor mandatory waiting
times for background checks, 89 percent would require childproof
safety locks on new weapons and 75 percent favor registration. But
the public is more divided on registering rifles and other long
guns, is split on laws that would ban concealed weapons and opposes
an outright prohibition on handguns.
</P>
<P>
   So while most Americans want stricter laws, many Americans hold
moderate or mixed views. Recent polls also find some backlash
against calls for control with growing numbers of Americans. A
number of polls have also found majorities agreeing with the NRA
position that better enforcement of existing laws is more important
than new laws.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, voters who take a strong pro-control position
overwhelming favor Gore on this issue, while those who hold the
opposite point of view think Bush best represents them. But voters
with a mixed or moderate position have more confidence in the
governor than the vice president, according to Pew Research Center
surveys. The judgments of the ``moderates'' at this point probably
have less to do with knowledge of what the candidates believe about
specific controls and rest more on hunches about them personally.
</P>
<P>
   A second component of this is gender, one of the most important
prisms in this campaign, especially when it comes to guns. Men have
more confidence in Bush and women more faith in Gore to represent
their views.
</P>
<P>
   How, and if, the issue affects voter decisions will hinge on the
outcome of the campaigns for and against gun control. Can the likes
of a million moms do what the NRA has done for years, that is mold
single issue voters? Can Bush hold the middle while hanging on to
the Second Amendment advocates. Can Gore effectively draw in more
female supporters, who favor controls, without further alienating
men who have less commitment to this cause?

<P>
   WALTHAM, Mass. _ Dr. Jeffrey M. Drazen, a leading asthma
researcher at Harvard with strong ties to the drug industry, was
named the editor of The New England Journal of Medicine on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the Journal's tough conflict-of-interest rules will force
Drazen not to write certain articles and editorials for at least
two years.
</P>
<P>
   Pledging to protect the integrity of the Journal's information,
Drazen, a professor of medicine at Harvard, said he would recuse
himself from the editorial process for any papers submitted that
relate to asthma or to nine major companies from which he has
received research grants or consultation fees.
</P>
<P>
   Drazen, 53, helped pioneer asthma drugs now taken by 4 million
asthmatics worldwide. In a news conference on Thursday, he strongly
defended the need for doctors to work closely and carefully with
the drug industry. He called the industry a powerful force without
which basic research findings made through taxpayer grants from the
National Institutes of Health could not be converted into new
therapies to improve patient care and public health.
</P>
<P>
   Last February, after an internal investigation prompted by
articles in The Los Angeles Times, the Journal found that it had
violated its own rules in publishing 19 articles by Drazen and
other authors with industry ties. The Journal said the articles
should have been written by scientists without such connections,
but its editors blamed themselves and said that Drazen had
disclosed his industry support.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that episode on Thursday, Drazen said that as the
Journal's new editor in chief he would hand over all manuscripts
dealing with his specialty or products made by the nine companies
to deputies ``and make sure that they are on the agenda at a time
when I do not come to the editorial meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   In such cases, Drazen said he wanted ``the Journal to be able to
judge the science that comes in, if it is good or bad, without me
having anything to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want to influence things in either a positive or a
negative way,'' he said. ``We want the good science and good
information to get out there'' in the Journal, which is one of the
most influential in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Drazen, who will leave his Harvard post, will be the Journal's
third editor in chief in less than a year. His selection follows
several years of turmoil between the editors of the Journal and its
owner, the Massachusetts Medical Society, concerning the society's
increasing business ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jerome P. Kassirer was fired last summer because of
conflicts with society officials over proposals to promote Web
sites and create specialty journals using the New England Journal
of Medicine's logo. In recent years, the Journal has become a huge
source of revenue for the medical society, largely through
increased drug company advertising. And the society has become
heavily dependent on the Journal's profits to maintain its new $50
million headquarters in Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1979, the Journal published its profits, which then were
$386,540 a year. The Journal no longer discloses its profits, which
are estimated to be at least $20 million a year, making its owner
the wealthiest medical society in the country. The Journal's
profits help keep the society's dues low and membership high,
giving the society a degree of political and lobbying clout it
would not otherwise have.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Drazen's selection, Kassirer said: ``I wish him
luck, he'll need it.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Angell succeeded Kassirer as editor in chief pending a
search committee's choice of a new editor. Angell, who was a
finalist, withdrew recently as a candidate and said she was
retiring to write a book on alternative medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steven A. Schroeder, president of the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation in Princeton, said he did not recall that the search
committee, of which he was a member, had discussed Drazen's ties to
the drug industry.
</P>
<P>
   Medical society officials said they were vesting Drazen with the
same editorial independence and authority to hire editors and staff
as his predecessors. The society also said Drazen ``will also have
complete authority over the brand of The Journal, including the use
of the name, logo, look and feel, in both the print and electronic
versions of The Journal.
</P>
<P>
   One unresolved issue is whether the society will move the
Journal's offices from a library in the Harvard Medical School
complex to the society's headquarters in a suburb of Boston, a site
that some editors see as too far removed from a hospital setting.
The library is within a few dozen yards of the Brigham and Women's
Hospital, a Harvard teaching hospital where Drazen is chief
pulmonary physician.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of his contract and critics of his ties to the drug
industry, Drazen said: ``I have got what it takes, and you are just
going to have to wait and see whether you believe it. There is no
way to judge it up front.''
</P>
<P>
   The search committee's first choice, Dr. Edward J. Benz Jr.,
physician in chief at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, said he
had been offered the position but had withdrawn for personal
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Dr. Harry L. Greene II, the executive vice
president of the society, Benz said he wanted to remain a full-time
medical school faculty member and continue his research for at
least a few more years. Benz denied in the letter that he was
turning down the editorship because of any dispute with the society
about editorial integrity, use of the Journal's logo, or location
of its editorial offices.

SUIT TO TEST ONLINE FREE SPEECH RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Civil liberties groups backed a lawsuit filed Thursday against
Internet portal Yahoo Inc., in a case that may become a key test of
free speech rights online.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo runs some of the most popular Internet message boards
devoted to chat about publicly-traded stocks. In turn the messages
have prompted hundreds of legal complaints from companies charging
defamation or that anonymous authors have disclosed trade secrets
online.
</P>
<P>
   In these cases Yahoo, of Santa Clara, Calif., has routinely
identified its users in response to subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   But critics including the American Civil Liberties Union say
most of the suits are frivolous and aimed to quash dissent. They
say Yahoo should do more to protect the privacy of its user base,
or at least admit how fragile online-anonymity has become.
</P>
<P>
   Now these critics think they have a test case, filed Thursday in
federal district court in Los Angeles by an Ohio man who says he
was fired after being identified as the author of critical messages
about his bosses at the AnswerThink Consulting Group of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The former employee, who doesn't identify himself in his suit,
seeks damages of more than $75,000. Another aim is to prod Yahoo to
notify users when their identities are being sought, said
plaintiff's attorney Megan Gray, and give them a chance to respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because any lawyer can issue subpoenas without a judge's
approval or a court hearing, Yahoo users are more vulnerable to
corporate bullying tactics,'' said Gray, of the Baker &AMP; Hostetler
law firm in Los Angeles
</P>
<P>
   The suit is supported by the ACLU and the Electronic Privacy
Information Center, which say it is the first time Yahoo has been
sued over its disclosure policies.
</P>
<P>
   The case is only the the latest obstacle for Yahoo as it tries
to develop standards for its online communities, full of
notoriously anarchic chatter. Last fall Yahoo executives admitted
to removing controversial material posted on the chat boards,
sometimes even censoring messages before subjects complained.
</P>
<P>
   In March, in a filing to the Securities &AMP; Exchange Commission,
Yahoo also disclosed a review by the Federal Trade Commission ``to
determine whether we have complied with applicable FTC consumer
protection regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   A Yahoo spokeswoman Thursday declined to comment on the lawsuit
or on the FTC's actions, except to note the disclaimers Yahoo makes
in its terms of service statements to users.
</P>
<P>
   These state that ``Yahoo is committed to safeguarding your
privacy online'' but also that Yahoo may turn over data in cases
``when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Yahoo rivals America Online and Microsoft say they
notify their users when an identity is sought in civil suits,
giving users the chance to try to block frivolous demands for their
identities. Unlike those companies, Yahoo's services are free and
the company has indicated users shouldn't expect the same privacy
protections.
</P>
<P>
   The questions of just how much protection to afford anonymous
speech aren't new. But in the past they often related to political
matters such as the Federalist Papers, published unsigned in 1787.
</P>
<P>
   The content now in dispute is hardly as weighty. In the Los
Angeles case, the plaintiff identifies himself only as ``John Doe''
and chose the Yahoo screen name of ``Aquacool 2000'' after a
water-cooler in his office, Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gray and others, Aquacool wrote 30 messages to the
Yahoo message board devoted to AnswerThink over a five-month
period, about half of which were critical of the company. For
instance, Aquacool wrote that one of AnswerThink's managers ``is so
dull that a 5-watt bulb gives him a run for the money,'' according
to the lawsuit
</P>
<P>
   In response, AnswerThink filed a defamation lawsuit against
Aquacool and several other defendants in federal court in Miami,
and issued subpoenas to Yahoo seeking to learn the real identity of
authors; Gray said Yahoo gave her a copy of the subpoena of
Aquacool's identity, with which it complied.
</P>
<P>
   AnswerThink then filed a second suit against Aquacool
specifically, fired him and denied him compensation, according to
the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Aquacool admits his messages contained criticism and ridicule of
AnswerThink's management, but says they weren't defamatory. By
turning over his identity to AnswerThink, Yahoo violated his
privacy and First Amendment rights.
</P>
<P>
   At the least, the suit says, Yahoo should have notified him when
it received the subpoena. Instead, the suit says, Yahoo has
``consciously ignored such complaints for the sole purpose of
reaping profits for itself and placating the anger of companies
that are the subject of message-board criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, AnswerThink said that its actions ``were taken
to protect the company and its shareholders from a former employee
who was divulging confidential information on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   AnswerThink executives wouldn't say just what information was
confidential.

CANADA IMPOSES SANCTIONS AFTER DR. LAURA INVEIGHS AGAINST GAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ Ruling that respect for gays and lesbians
is a more fundamental value than freedom of speech, Canada's
broadcast watchdog has thunderously condemned American radio host
Dr. Laura Schlessinger, warning that her program could ignite
antigay violence.
</P>
<P>
   In what may be the most strongly-worded ruling in the body's
history, the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council rebuked
Schlessinger for what it called ``abusively discriminatory''
violations of Canada's broadcast code for stating that homosexual
behavior is ``abnormal,'' ``aberrant,'' and ``deviant.'' The
comments were made on her popular radio call-in program.
</P>
<P>
   The council also condemned Canadian radio stations that
broadcast the show, and will require them to censor antigay
comments on future broadcasts and to broadcast statements on the
ruling at prime time _ in effect, warning Canadian listeners
against Schlessinger's ideas.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual aside, the council stepped back from
Schlessinger's show to take a swipe at the fundamental American
precept that even unpopular opinions have the right to be aired.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Canada, we respect freedom of speech but do not worship
it,'' the council stated.
</P>
<P>
   The self-policing industry regulatory group, to which 430
private Canadian radio and television stations belong, denounced
Schlessinger's views as tantamount to racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sexual practices of gays and lesbians are as much a part
of their being as the color of one's skin or the gender, religion,
age or ethnicity of an individual,'' the council ruled late
Wednesday. ``To use such brutal language as she does about such an
essential characteristic flies in the face of Canadian provisions
relating to human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling marked the second time in recent years that Canada
has sought to swat a controversial American radio personality from
the northern airwaves. In the mid-1990s, Howard Stern _ then aired
by two Canadian stations _ came under fire from the broadcast
council for referring to French-Quebecers as ``scumbags'' and
saying they should learn English.
</P>
<P>
   Stern's show has since been dropped by a Montreal station and is
closely monitored and occasionally edited by the Toronto
broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of gay rights in Canada were jubilant about the
harshly-worded ruling against Schlessinger, whose conservative
notions have also drawn protests in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on Cloud Nine,'' said Ian Crowe of Halifax, one of the
four individuals who filed formal complaints against Dr. Laura with
the council. ``I feel I've done good for the world. . . . What this
says is Dr. Laura is not allowed to call me deviant, aberrant,
disordered or dysfunctional.''
</P>
<P>
   According to industry estimates, Schlessinger's show attracts
about 18 million listeners on nearly 500 stations in the United
States and Canada. She also writes a column that appears in more
than 100 newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, it is a criminal offense to ``willfully promote
hatred'' against an ``identifiable group,'' a category that
includes racial, religious and ethnic minorities as well as people
whose only common bond is their sexuality, such as gays or
lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Cohen, chairman of the broadcast council, said Canadian
radio stations may still broadcast Schlessinger's show but must
censor any comments that insult or denigrate homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human rights are very important for the CBSC,'' he said.
``This is one of the clearest judgments on this issue we have
released.''
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling, the council acknowledged that Schlessinger did
not ``advocate any of the homophobic hostility or, worse,
brutality, which can be found in criminal corners of society.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the ruling warned, broadcasting her views on gay
and lesbian issues ``(might) fertilize the ground for other less
well-balanced elements . . . to take such aggressive steps.''

 &HT;    Ford chair defends SUV safety, environment steps
 &HT;    By Russell Grantham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ford Motor Co. admitted at the company's annual
meeting in Atlanta on Thursday that its big, gasoline-thirsty but
popular sport-utility vehicles also have unleashed environmental
and safety problems.
</P>
<P>
   But company Chairman William Clay Ford Jr. also said the
Dearborn, Mich.-based automaker will keep making and selling SUVs
because it has done more to reduce their emissions and their threat
to other drivers than its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't do it, somebody else would, and they wouldn't do
it as responsibly,'' he told reporters Thursday after the company's
annual meeting. SUVs, pickups and vans account for about half of
Ford's North American vehicle sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not encouraging wanton destruction of the environment
using our SUVs,'' said Ford. But he added that he's aware vehicles
like Ford's 19-foot-long, nine-passenger Excursion open it to
criticism by environmental and auto safety groups that claim such
vehicles release more smog-causing emissions, can cause damage to
the environment when used off-road and can overrun smaller cars in
collisions.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co. highlighted those and other issues in a
``corporate citizenship report'' that was passed out to
shareholders Thursday along with annual financial reports.
</P>
<P>
   Ford told about 300 shareholders that he wants the company to be
open about its problems and achievements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to become a more transparent company and to have
everything that we do, good or bad, out there,'' he said. ``We take
our social responsibility very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the company has voluntarily certified its SUVs, pickups
and vans to meet tougher federal emissions standards years before
the standards take effect.
</P>
<P>
   Ford alternates its annual meetings between Detroit and areas
where it has a significant presence.
</P>
<P>
   The company builds the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable at its
Hapeville, Ga., plant, which has been the subject of speculation
about expansion. Ford President and Chief Executive Officer Jacques
Nasser told shareholders it was too early to detail Ford's plans
for the plant, which he said is among the company's best. But, he
added, ``The future of the Atlanta plant is very assured.''
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Nasser said the company would announce
changes today, Friday in its European operations as part of a
restructuring plan there. Nasser said the company would take an
unspecified charge against earnings.
</P>
<P>
   In speaking to shareholders, Nasser said Ford's North American
products are driving the automaker's solid financial performance.
``All of these new products have given us one problem: How to build
enough of them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford shares closed up 68 3/4 cents at $52.93 3/4 on Thursday.

Egan of Bridgeport, Conn., has been chosen the ninth archbishop of
New York, to succeed Cardinal John O'Connor, who died last week. As
a seminary student in Chicago, Egan was the only member of his
class chosen to go to Rome to finish his theology studies. As a

LOS ALAMOS WILD FIRE FORCES EVACUATION OF 25,000 PEOPLE FROM THEIR
HOMES
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. _ Fed by winds gusting at up to 50 miles an
hour, a wild fire here resumed its path of devastation on Thursday,
forcing the evacuation of as many as 25,000 people and destroying
at least 150 homes, perhaps twice that number, but apparently not
causing serious damage at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, where
nuclear weapons are designed.
</P>
<P>
   As officials warned that there was still little chance of
bringing the blaze under control until the weather changed, a
growing chorus of local and national officials began to express
their anger at the National Park Service, which set what it had
hoped would be a controlled fire a week ago before high winds sent
it racing across heavily wooded canyons toward the populated areas.
</P>
<P>
   As reports circulated here that the National Weather Service had
warned before the fire was set that high winds were expected, the
Interior Department, which operates the park service, announced
late in the day that Roy Weaver, the superintendent of the
Bandelier National Monument, where the fire was set, was placed on
administrative leave pending an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe someone is responsible,'' Sen. Pete Domenici,
R-N.M., said at a press conference here on Thursday morning. ``The
person in charge at the park service who authorized the burn is
most responsible.'' He added that he intended to ask for a federal
investigation of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Although more than 18,000 acres have already burned and more
than 1,000 emergency and fire personnel have been brought in to try
and control the fire, there have been no injuries reported and the
hasty evacuation of the huge number of people was described as
orderly.
</P>
<P>
   But Los Alamos presented a disconcerting tableau on Thursday,
during a reporter's visit to the blackened streets. Fire vehicles
rushed about, the skies dark with thick plumes of white smoke and
helicopters occasionally whirring overhead, carrying huge buckets
of water. Most neighborhoods presented an eerie checkerboard of
destruction, with houses seemingly selected at random for total
destruction alongside other homes left unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who flew in from a conference
in San Diego on Thursday morning, said that the Los Alamos National
Laboratory had suffered some fire damage but was secure. He added
that there were no signs that any radiation had been released and
that the modest amount of radioactive materials stored at the lab _
no nuclear weapons are kept there, he said _ was in bunkers that
were far from the fire.
</P>
<P>
   John Brown, the lab's director, said that the government
maintains numerous sensors at the lab to detect any release of
radiation. He said the sensors were still working and that nothing
had been detected. The government said later that it was bringing
in additional detectors to place around the region to insure that
any releases are caught quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, just the 11,000 or so residents of Los Alamos, a tidy
town high on a mesa at about 7,200 feet, had been evacuated. But
starting on Wednesday night and then throughout the day on Thursday
the residents of the nearby towns of White Rock and the Espanola
Valley, as well as Abiqui, were told to leave the area. Abiqui is
famous for having been the home of Georgia O'Keefe, the artist, for
many years and much of her work is still kept there.
</P>
<P>
   A local radio station took calls from people all day who
recounted having been given just minutes to clear out of their
homes. Many said they had had time to do little more than throw
some clothes into plastic garbage bags, grab their pets and
children and flee, with the smoke and flames visible nearby. One
man called in to ask if any of the authorities had information
about his two dogs; he had not had time to bring them in before he
departed in haste on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The streets of Los Alamos were a crazy quilt of random
destruction. The heat of the fires transformed many houses, cars,
utility poles and lawns into cinders. Typical was 49th Street in
the western part of the city, where the once tidy homes were razed
in twos and threes, while right alongside them other homes were
untouched, the grass still green.
</P>
<P>
   Viola Stowe, a resident of the city, who had been evacuated to a
shelter at a high school in Espanola, said she watched a house burn
on the television news on Wednesday night, and only when the camera
pulled back did she realize it was her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't plan for these things,'' she said. ``You don't think
it'll happen to you.''

FAMILY LIFE, NOT A CUP OF TEA 
SLOWLY MOVING INTO DVD

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   FAMILY LIFE, NOT A CUP OF TEA: Alan Ball was talking about his
idea for a movie the other day. ``Can you imagine pitching this?''
he asked. ``Two families, really screwed up. You think you know
what's going on, but it's really something different because
actually the movie is about the elusive nature of reality, and
there's a whole metaphysical bit with this plastic bag.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, ``American Beauty,'' was Ball's first movie script. It
didn't seem to be Hollywood's cup of tea. ``I thought, `If it ever
gets made, it will be for $12,' '' he said. But Steven Spielberg
liked what he read, and his studio, DreamWorks, bought it. Five
Academy Awards later, one of them for Ball as best screenwriter,
the film has been released on videocassette.
</P>
<P>
   Now that it is on tape, what is there new to notice? ``I've seen
it 20 times,'' Ball said. ``I see little continuity glitches, but I
also see things in the performances I didn't see the first 19
times.'' He mentioned the subtlety of Thora Birch's performance as
the mutinous teen-age daughter of Lester and Carolyn Burnham (Kevin
Spacey and Annette Bening) and the many layers Chris Cooper gave
Colonel Fitts, the Burnhams' spectacularly troubled neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   On video, one is again struck by the film's clean structure and
bright look, which sets off the darkness of the material. Ball and
Sam Mendes, the director, made a commentary for the DVD, which
hasn't been released or scheduled. ``Sam explains how at the
beginning of the film everything is a little darker, and as Lester
opens up and starts having a new life, there's more light,'' Ball
said.
</P>
<P>
   At first he did not like the idea that DreamWorks would be
making his film. ``I said no because they'd turn it into something
big and bloated and weird,'' he said. ``But then they convinced me
that they wouldn't. And they didn't.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SLOWLY MOVING INTO DVD: Like ``American Beauty,'' other films
with Spielberg connections are taking their time coming to DVD. The
next arrival will be ``Jaws,'' to be issued on disc by Universal on
July 11 and now No. 4 on Video Business magazine's list of the
biggest movies still missing on DVD.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of them are Spielberg's; it only seems that way. At the
top are the ``Star Wars'' films, which now include ``Episode I: The
Phantom Menace,'' from Fox. No reason is given for their absence,
but release decisions lie with their creator, George Lucas. Next
come the ``Godfather'' films. No blaming Spielberg here, either.
Distributors say the delay is caused by their director, Francis
Ford Coppola.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg's approval is needed for the Indiana Jones films, No.
3 as a group, as it is for ``Jurassic Park,'' No. 5 after ``Jaws.''
He directed them all. From there the list fans out: ``Dr.
Zhivago,'' ``The Sound of Music,'' the three ``Back to the Future''
films (also controlled by Spielberg), ``Ben-Hur,'' the four
``Superman'' movies starring Christopher Reeve, ``Lawrence of
Arabia,'' ``Saturday Night Live,'' ``Grease'' and ``Touch of
Evil.'' &QL;

   ``Were you two lovers?'' Henry (Stephen Rea) asks Maurice (Ralph
Fiennes). In fact, Maurice and Henry's wife, Sarah (Julianne
Moore), had a wartime affair, but now Maurice is about to join
Henry in an investigation of Sarah's latest affair. In his
adaptation of Graham Greene's 1951 novel, the director Neil Jordan
brilliantly turns to the real concern: an agonizing struggle
between religious faith and carnal love. Taking artful liberties,
``he creates a seamlessly engrossing film that does full justice to
its depth of thought and feeling,'' Janet Maslin wrote in The New

   Like a crowded Diego Rivera sociopolitical lobby mural, Tim
Robbins' sprawling cinematic pastiche tries to crystallize
Depression art, government and economics into a single and grand
theatrical gesture: ``The Cradle Will Rock,'' as staged by Orson
Welles and John Houseman. A WPA Federal Theater Project, ``Cradle''
is a Brechtian agitprop work by Marc Blitzstein (Hank Azaria), who
dreams up a musical under the auspices of an imaginary Brecht.
Robbins mounts a parallel ``Ragtime''-like tableau in a ``big,

 LOS ALAMOS, N.M.: to you.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton has already declared the region a disaster
area, making it eligible for federal aid, and emergency officials
flew in on Thursday from Washington to both help control the fire
and to plan relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was burning to the north and to the northeast on
Thursday, away from populated areas. But firefighters were still
concerned, in part because the flames were spewing burning chunks
of wood thousands of feet in the air, where they were being blown
as far as a mile and starting new fires. Also, any shift in the
winds could push the fires toward homes and the nuclear lab, where
some buildings have already been singed.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Purtymun, a Los Alamos police officer, said another
concern was that because the fires had left many houses and trees
standing, there was still plenty of fuel if the blaze roared across
the city again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, anything can happen now,'' said Mike Gowey, a Forest
Service firefighter. ``There are spot fires everywhere. This is
nowhere near under control.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service defended the practice of setting
controlled fires, saying the fires are an essential means of
heading off devastating accidental fires in forests that have grown
overly dense because of fire suppression over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of a prescribed burn is to eliminate underbrush to
head off catastrophic fires,'' said Michael Gauldin, the chief
spokesman for the Interior Department. He said such burns were
conducted over millions of acres every year, by the Forest Service,
the Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was intentionally set last Thursday as part of a
continuing effort by Bandelier National Monument to thin out some
of the dense growth that makes the pine forests in the region among
the most combustible in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Monument officials say they weighed the factors that go into
such planning: the amount of wood and other tinder in the forest,
the moisture content of the fuels, the relative humidity and
temperature of the air, and the speed of the wind. Then they
plugged the data into a computer program and decided conditions
were auspicious for a safe and effective burn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The data and the spot weather forecasts met the fire
prescription,'' the Bandelier superintendent, Weaver, said in an
interview before his suspension was announced. ``It's not like
someone was just picking things out of the air.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Weaver said the fire team had requested and received weather
updates throughout the day, as late as two hours before the flames
were ignited at 7:20 p.m. Thursday. Seeing no reason to call off
the plan, the crew set the fire. Then, he said, the winds whipped
up unexpectedly, and the flames began spreading toward Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   About seven hours before the fire was set, the National Weather
Service office in Albuquerque faxed a report, requested by
Bandelier, predicting that winds on the ridgetops would increase to
10 to 15 miles an hour that evening, gusting to 20 miles an hour
the next day. The report also said relative humidity would not
increase as much as it normally does in the evening, ranging
between 15 percent to as high as 30 percent after midnight. A more
normal nighttime reading is 50 to 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The weather report also predicted that a factor called the
Haines index, which measures the tendency of smoke and flames to
rise vertically, was at its maximum level _ 6 on a scale of 2 to 6.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wallace Covington, a professor at Northern Arizona
University's School of Forestry in Flagstaff, said that these
numbers, while not ideal, would not automatically rule out a burn.
If the ground is too wet and the air too still, he said, a burn
will not do its job. And while a high Haines index might mean
flames are more likely to leap into the tree tops, starting a
rapidly proliferating ``crown fire,'' the vertical motion also
helps keep smoke away from settlements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the devil and the deep blue sea,'' Covington said.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Weaver said that his staff attempted a prescribed burn in
the same area in fall 1992, when the air was more humid and still.
``It accomplished nothing,'' he said. ``We wasted our time and
resources. ``

DELL'S EARNINGS EXCEED EXPECTATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dell Computer Corp. posted better-than-expected
first-quarter earnings on Thursday, benefiting from a richer mix of
products, with particular strength in sales of servers and storage
devices for Internet use.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended April 28, Dell's profit rose 21 percent,
to $525 million, or 19 cents a diluted share, compared with $434
million, or 16 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue
rose 31 percent, to $7.28 billion from $5.54 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected Dell to earn 16 cents a share, according
to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks company earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Before Dell reported its results, its shares closed down 25
cents, to $44.6875. In after-hours trading, Dell rose as high as
$47.625.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's relative strength could help reassure technology
investors coming after a quarter when the Microsoft Corp. reported
slower-than-expected revenue. Many analysts have suggested that
companies are embracing Windows 2000 more slowly. Dell itself said
in February that its historic growth rates were unsustainable and
projected revenue growth in the low 30 percent range.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Kunstler, an analyst with J.P. Morgan, said that Dell's
revenue only modestly exceeded his estimate but that in the current
climate, that was a positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given that everyone is really nervous about PC sales, it's
good that they beat it even by a little,'' Kunstler said. ``Dell
had guided down expectations ahead of Microsoft, so it's not like
one company's results are in conflict with the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell said the portion of its business coming from more
profitable products continued to increase, with revenue from
servers, storage products, work stations and notebook PCs at 48
percent of sales, up from 39 percent in the quarter a year earlier.
At the same time, the cost of components declined, particularly for
memory chips, which had been in short supply until recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some better-than-expected component pricing, and a
better-than-expected product mix,'' said Kevin Rollins, Dell's vice
chairman. ``That contributed to about 2 cents of the uptick,
relative to First Call. The other penny came from tapping into our
investments.''
</P>
<P>
   Rollins said Dell remained comfortable with revenue growth
forecasts in the low 30 percent range for the rest of the year.
``There may be some challenges in the second half of the year
concerning components,'' he said, ``but that will be offset by this
continuing infrastructure build for the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Dell announced a strategy to sell products and
services to Web-based businesses. Dell said sales to the largest
dot-com companies and Internet-service providers had grown nearly
260 percent over the last two quarters. Over the last two months,
the Dell Host Web-hosting service has gained more than 2,000
customers, 40 percent of them new to Dell and half of which
switched from other host suppliers, the company said.  &QL;

THAT'S THE TICKET

By EVAN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've just rolled past a stop sign and been handed a most
unwelcome piece of paper by a police officer who was lurking behind
a nearby hedge. A few phone calls later, a court officer tells you
that you can make things right by giving up a few hours of your
life to (shudder!) traffic school.
</P>
<P>
   Now you have a choice:
</P>
<P>
   A. Spend eight hours in a classroom, watching films, playing
games and interacting with an instructor and classmates.
</P>
<P>
   B. Take the class at home, at your leisure, interacting only
with your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, option A has its perks (who knows? the love of your
life could be in sitting in that classroom), but the ease and
convenience of the Internet combined with a veritable bloom in the
number of providers has more and more people making a bee line for
option B.
</P>
<P>
   People who have erased their ticket from the comfort of their
home or office say the experience sure beats sacrificing a Saturday
listening to someone who thinks he's a comedian lecture you about
drunken driving and road rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took traditional traffic school 15 years ago, and there is
no comparison,'' said Lisa Wiles of West Hills, who erased a
speeding ticket through the On-Line Traffic School. ``They actually
made it somewhat humorous, and I didn't feel like I did when I was
in class and there was a boring person lecturing me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish the officer who had given me the ticket had been as
pleasant to deal with as the class,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get the wrong idea, though _ the Internet is not your easy
way out.
</P>
<P>
   You'll still have to spend several hours boning up on road
regulations and pass a written test to prove the information has
penetrated your brain. But with an online (or home study) program,
you can take the course at your leisure, pausing to answer the
phone, take a nap or write your Nobel Prize acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   And before you even think about cheating, keep in mind that the
site operators designed the programs with safeguards against
fraudulent test-takers.
</P>
<P>
   Operators say an online course is an awfully attractive
alternative for the single parent who would otherwise have to shell
out significant bucks for baby-sitting costs; to women in the later
stages of pregnancy or to someone with a disability for whom
sitting several hours in a classroom would be inconvenient or
seriously uncomfortable; or to motorists who were ticketed a long
distance from home.
</P>
<P>
   Without a single, all-encompassing regulatory agency, there's no
way to determine how much traffic school business goes to online
companies. Since the Web is still very much a middle- to
upper-middle-class medium, online operators point out that large
segments of the population don't have access to a computer, much
less the opportunity to spend several hours online reading about
the difference between a green and yellow curb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine traditional traffic schools having problems,''
says Joel Yarbrough, chief operator of the Oakland-based
Clicklearning.com and WebTrafficSchool.com. ``We have just opened
people's eyes to the existence of the option.''
</P>
<P>
   The online courses all work about the same way. You pay your fee
(via a credit card or check), read the course work, take pop
quizzes periodically at the end of chapters, and take an
all-encompassing final exam at the end. Once you pass, the Web
school sends your certificate of completion to the court that has
jurisdiction over your violation. And, as with a classroom traffic
school, your driving record is cleared of the infraction once the
course is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the county superior court systems _ which are
ultimately responsible for sanctioning the growing number of online
traffic schools _ say the feedback they receive from mandatory
surveys are overwhelmingly positive. Whether the program is in a
booklet, on video, CD ROM or the Internet, customers love the
home-study option.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity also accounts for the boom in the online traffic
school market. In 1997, when Lisa Warren developed the nation's
first Internet-based traffic school (the Westlake Village-based
On-Line Traffic School), her only competition was a video program
available through Blockbuster video.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, the market is flooded.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've copied our name and even our home pages,
unfortunately,'' said Warren, who claims her program is the first
and largest program on the market. ``But it is good for the
industry. People find it more convenient than sitting in class.''
</P>
<P>
   Web traffic schools have tried to price each other out of the
market (courses average $20 to $25) and often look for a
competitive edge by offering everything from a better-written
program to superior customer service. When not competing for
business, they've formed the Association of Online Traffic Safety
Educators _ to set industry standards and have even hired a
Sacramento-based lobbyist to battle a state assembly bill, which,
if passed, would require students to take a proctored test.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, AB 681, written by state assemblyman Thomas Calderon,
D- Montebello, has operators concerned about a provision that would
require attendees to take a proctored final exam. Such a move would
compromise the attractiveness of the home study option, according
to home traffic school proponents. The bill is in the senate
transportation committee.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with online traffic schools, say officials from the
Department of Motor Vehicles, is the potential for beating the
system. How does a Web school operator guarantee the student on the
other end of the keyboard, the one busily typing in quiz answers in
an effort to purify his or her driving record, is the person who
actually got the ticket in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   The potential for fraud is the reason the DMV has avoided
regulating online traffic schools, despite the fact the online
course work is based on information from the DMV manual.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not wanting to license a system that has no way to
verify that the person who got the ticket is actually attending,''
said Evan Nossoff, a DMV spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   With a little ingenuity, you can get someone to do it, say
traffic school operators, but most traffic offenders will find it
isn't worth the effort. Not only do you have to find someone
willing to give up !ital!his time, but you have to trust that
person with privileged information. And both of you face felony
charges if caught.
</P>
<P>
   Internet traffic schools install various safeguards, such as
pop-up questions that ask the student for the type of personal
information nobody but the person who got the ticket should have.
Future cheat-proof upgrades could include such features as
fingerprint identification to voice recognition, although the
fancier you get, the more likely you are to lose customers, say
operators.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that's not to say Internet traffic schools can't be
high-tech. Remember the boom of classroom traffic schools that
promised to be better, smarter, funnier? Their Web counterparts say
they still have to develop a gimmick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to deliver pizza over the Internet,'' said
Yarbrough, ``but somebody will get there.''

RUSSIAN SECURITY AGENCIES RAID DISSIDENT MEDIA EMPIRE
</HEADLINE>
  By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Federal agents wielding guns and wearing black masks
staged a raid on the downtown headquarters of Russia's largest
private media empire on Thursday, raising alarms among politicians
and journalists about the prospects for an independent press under
President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Media-MOST, a holding company that has been in and out of
political favor with the Kremlin for years, controls influential
radio and television stations as well as a newspaper, a news
magazine and other publications. Its corporate offices were still
being searched Thursday night as top law enforcement officials
issued conflicting statements on the purpose of the criminal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   MOST officials condemned the action as a crude attempt at
political intimidation against a media group that had already been
isolated by the Kremlin in recent months for taking a critical view
of Putin, some members of his administration and the conduct of the
war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obvious that what is going on is a factor of political
pressure,'' said Vladimir Gusinsky, president and founder of
Media-MOST, who flew back to Moscow from Israel on Thursday to
handle the crisis. ``It is a simply a pity that just a few days
after the new president of Russia took office _ the president on
whom many people pin hope for a rebirth of the country _ it looks
like everything is going backward, the same masks, the same special
services, the same witch hunting.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Thursday night, Aleksandr Zdanovich, a spokesman
for the FSB, the federal domestic intelligence agency that is the
successor to the KGB, said that the search of Media-MOST offices
had turned up recordings and files containing evidence against the
company's managers and correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   Charges by Media-MOST officials that the raid was politically
motivated were ``but an attempt to distract the attention of the
public from the holding's financial problems,'' Zdanovich said.
``They are trying to conceal the true reasons for what is
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Media-MOST was the target of a raid by federal special agents in
1994, after NTV, its flagship television station, began critical
broadcasts about Russia's first war against Chechnya. This time,
the investigation was not so rough, but no less thorough. Federal
agents _ representing a collection of agencies including the tax
police, the security police and the general prosecutor's office _
carted out boxes of documents, equipment and even cassettes of
popular TV programs reportedly taken from Gusinsky's own office at
the company's recently opened headquarters on a quiet Moscow side
street.
</P>
<P>
   Coming in the first week of the Putin administration, at a time
when observers here and abroad are waiting to see what Russia's new
president will do with the considerable powers of his office, the
raid Thursday was widely seen as an inauspicious beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we saw was some kind of a military operation _
camouflage, weapons, seizure of big buildings, lots of people,''
said Oleg Mironov, who heads the Russian Parliament's human rights
committee. ``It is an alarming fact, a demonstration of force that
is undermining the authority of Vladimir Putin who just took
office, proclaiming the ideas of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those politicians who withheld judgment on the purpose of
the raid were strongly critical of the methods. ``A suspicion
immediately arises that it may be linked with dissatisfaction with
the channel's information policy,'' said Sergei Kiriyenko, a former
prime minister and leader of a liberal party. ``Even if this is not
true, such methods of operations allow doubts, and discredit the
noblest of motives that the tax service might have.''
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Berger, the chief editor of Segnodnya, Media-MOST's
daily newspaper, said he was certain that federal investigators
were set on finding evidence to compromise the entire media empire,
and to silence critics of the Putin administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are looking for anything,'' he said. ``There was an order
issued _ from Putin, from whomever _ to find whatever at
Media-MOST. It is like a military command: find something,
anything, no matter the cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger said he had anticipated a harsh reaction to recent
investigative articles that focused on top officers of the FSB,
Putin's old employer.
</P>
<P>
   The MOST media group has been at loggerheads with the Kremlin
for the last year, ever since its reporters, both in print and on
television, began to aggressively cover charges of corruption at
the very highest levels of the presidential administration.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The conflict deepened as Russia moved into its election season,
and Media-MOST shifted its support to the anti-Kremlin opposition,
headed by Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov. The ensuing war between
Russia's two major media groups soon began to resemble an ugly
vendetta, where political differences blended into personal
rivalries.
</P>
<P>
   One of Media-MOST group's chief enemies is Aleksandr Voloshin,
the chief of the Kremlin staff and a holdover from the
administration of former President Boris Yeltsin, who has openly
vowed to destroy Gusinsky's media empire. Pressure has also come
from Gazprom, the partially state-owned natural gas company that
has recently called on the MOST group to pay back some $200 million
in outstanding credits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several members of the president administration didn't make it
a secret that they regard MOST media as the only signficant
opposition in the country,'' said Masha Lipman, a deputy editor at
Itogi, the group's weekly news magazine. ``Today's action looks
exceptionally brutal, but there have been repeated instances _ tax
inspections, fire inspections _ that could be regarded as soft
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   When the raid began shortly after 9 a.m., federal authorities
offered no explanations at all. According to a news report on NTV,
the agents did not identify themselves, or show any documents, as
they began to search the premises and interrogate employees.
</P>
<P>
   Unofficial spokesmen at first told Russian news agencies that
the raid was connected with an investigation, several years old,
into a former Finance Ministry official, and that the company was
being charged with among other things, disclosure of commercial
secrets. By the end of the day, both the Russian general
prosecutor's office and the Federal Security Service said they were
investigating Media-MOST's private security operations, which they
said had been involved in illegal surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Media-MOST, like many other major Russian corporations, has
hired former top-ranking members of the old Soviet KGB to run both
their security service and a wide ranging intelligence gathering
network, employing hundreds, even thousands, of people.

VICE PRESIDENT VISITS INNOVATIVE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CUDAHY, Calif. _ More accustomed to dealing with conflicts
between senators or nations, Democratic presidential contender Al
Gore began Thursday by listening to fourth- and fifth-graders
explain how they cope with hostile relations at their school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do some kids get into more trouble than others?'' the vice
president asked, triggering nods from a group of students selected
to solve peer conflicts at the Elizabeth Learning Center.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spent the day meeting with students and teachers at this
innovative kindergarten through 12th grade school, which draws from
this poor and predominately Hispanic East Los Angeles enclave.
</P>
<P>
   Seated at a picnic table in the school courtyard, Gore explained
to designated student ``conflict managers'' that some children may
be more belligerent because they have ``been victims of violence''
at home.
</P>
<P>
   He praised the mediators-in-training for helping their
classmates get along without resorting to name-calling or physical
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your parents must be very proud of you,'' said Gore before he
headed off to meet with parent volunteers and then to help teach a
first-grade class.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign visit was the fifth in a weekly series of what the
Gore campaign has dubbed his ``school days,'' where the candidate
devotes an entire day at a public school, usually located in an
important electoral state.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign views the school events as a way to underscore
the candidate's commitment to what voters tell pollsters is their
top priority: education. His Republican rival, George W. Bush, has
stressed education and frequently stops by schools. Last week on a
California swing, the Texas governor visited a San Diego elementary
school.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore the school events also help to soften the vice
president's stiff image by generating photographs of a smiling
candidate interacting with students and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, who arrived in California late Wednesday,
spent the night at the home of the principal, Emilio Vasquez, and
showed up at the school at 7 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of students, dressed in their mandatory uniforms of
white shirts and blue pants and skirts, rushed up to him as he
roamed the concrete walks linking several buildings and temporary
classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Later he plopped cross-legged on the floor with the
first-graders, who engaged him in a contraction word game. As they
repeatedly outfoxed him at the game Gore mockingly moaned ``oh
nooo, you're beating me '' and clasped his hand to his head as he
burst into laughter.
</P>
<P>
   At lunchtime he queued up with the students to receive his
chicken taquitos and beans and then sat down with members of the
student council, who gave him the pros and cons of attending the
school. While many praised the learning environment, they also
complained of crowded facilities, lack of a high school library and
not enough computers.
</P>
<P>
   At an afternoon question-and-answer session with students and
teachers, Gore said he opposed legalizing marijuana for medicinal
purposes and told an illegal immigrant who asked about college aid
to speak to one of his top advisers, Donna Brazile. Last December,
Gore was more equivocal on the marijuana issue, telling an audience
in New Hampshire that doctors ought to have the option to use the
drug. However, he later backed away from that stand.
</P>
<P>
   The trip to the Elizabeth Learning Center also gave Gore the
opportunity to see how an experimental urban school deals with the
problems of poverty, violence and language barriers.
</P>
<P>
   The 3,000-student school is located in an industrial area where
the per capita income is slightly more than $5,000 and 28 percent
of families fall below the poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all of the student body, which is 98 percent Hispanic,
qualifies for federally subsidized student lunches and many do not
speak English as a first language.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Los Angeles Unified School district, the second
largest district in the country, the school has been designated an
``urban learning center,'' which means the educators have tried to
foster closer relations with the community by providing adult
education and health facilities that parents as well as students
can use.

   NEW YORK _ After a week of unusually explicit leaks, the Vatican
formally announced Thursday that Bishop Edward Michael Egan of
Bridgeport, Conn., had been chosen the ninth archbishop of New
York, to succeed Cardinal John O'Connor, who died last week at the
age of 80. Egan is to be installed as archbishop on June 19 in a
ceremony at St. Patrick's Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to say we wouldn't be surprised,'' said the Rev. Roger
Caplis, a seminary classmate of Egan's in Chicago, ``that if
anything happened in New York, Ed would be considered. They know
him in Rome. That makes a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   As a seminary student in Chicago, Egan was the only member of
his class chosen to go to Rome to finish his theology studies.
</P>
<P>
   As a young priest, he spent a mere year in a parish before he
was plucked to serve as an assistant to the cardinal of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   And later in the Vatican, he was one of six experts in church
law selected to spend mornings with Pope John Paul II over
breakfast, helping him review each word of the proposed new Code of
Canon Law.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the Vatican's announcement, Egan appeared before the
news media, saying that when he first learned of the appointment
several weeks ago, ``My first reaction was, Edward, get down on
your knees and beg the Lord to give you a hand, and don't get up
too quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Tall and burly with a voice to match, Egan told a television
reporter who reminded him that he is now the boss, ``I don't feel
like the boss, but give me a little time and I will.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who have tracked Bishop Egan's 43-year career in the
church say that he is a man who likes to take charge. In
Bridgeport, he had his hands in everything from the pension plan to
celebrating the confirmation Masses for nearly every child
confirmed in the diocese. His supporters praise him as a hands-on
administrator, a successful fund-raiser, a lively intellectual and
a talented homilist.
</P>
<P>
   But some who know him worry that he has spent so much of his
career in Rome that he is not adequately in touch with the church
in America, where laypeople have assumed an increasingly important
role. His parish experience was so brief that he has been pegged as
an ``office priest'' rather than a ``street priest.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bridgeport, his critics say he responded more as a legal
adversary than a pastor to parishioners who claimed they had been
sexually abused by priests in his diocese.
</P>
<P>
   People who have known both Egan and O'Connor say that the two
men are temperamental opposites, with very different styles and
skills.
</P>
<P>
   Where O'Connor was spontaneous and blunt, Egan is cautious and
measured. While O'Connor was earthy, the son of a union man, Egan
is courtly, the son of a businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Where O'Connor was more interested in ministering than in
managing the business affairs of the enormous corporation that is
the New York archdiocese, Egan involved himself in everything from
architectural plans for churches to building the endowment of the
Bridgeport diocese.
</P>
<P>
   And while O'Connor was loath to close even underused schools and
churches, Egan has made some tough and unpopular decisions in
Bridgeport to consolidate and, in some cases, shut facilities in
his diocese.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's shown tremendous strength and decisiveness,'' said
Richard F. Futie, pastor at St. Mary's Church in Stamford. ``He's
been efficient, wise, prudent and thrifty, and put us on a solvent
course.''
</P>
<P>
   Egan is, by all accounts, extremely erudite. He is fluent in
Latin, Italian and French, and learned to speak Spanish while in
Bridgeport, which is home to many Hispanic Catholics. He plays
classical piano. He reads up on quantum physics and cosmology.
</P>
<P>
   He has scant experience in the political spotlight, however,
receiving a few national headlines for speaking out against
abortion and in favor of taxpayer-financed vouchers for private and
secular schools. In a little-known move, he was one of only two
Catholic bishops to endorse a group affiliated with the Christian
Coalition, the conservative political lobby founded by Pat
Robertson and Ralph Reed.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Alliance had been set up to attract Catholics to
the work of the Christian Coalition, which was perceived to be
dominated by Protestants. But it quickly ran into fierce opposition
from bishops who did not welcome the idea of a politically
conservative, Republican-leaning group presuming to speak for
Catholics in America.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Egan issued a letter in 1996 congratulating the
Catholic Alliance's leadership and offering ``my prayers and
cooperation.'' Egan now serves as one of five bishop advisers for
the Catholic Alliance, which is now independent from the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Egan is not a newcomer to the New York archdiocese. But last
time, he received a less than warm welcome.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Egan was appointed an auxiliary bishop in the
archdiocese after spending 14 years in Rome. O'Connor made it no
secret that Egan had been foisted on him by the Vatican. Priests in
New York still remember the letter that O'Connor sent to his clergy
members explaining that Egan was not his choice, and that any one
of them would have been just as qualified.
</P>
<P>
   When it came time toast his new auxiliary bishop at a dinner in
Rome in Egan's honor, O'Connor raised his glass and proclaimed him
``Chicago's revenge on New York.''
</P>
<P>
   When Egan left for Bridgeport three years later, many priests
said that O'Connor was not sorry to see him go.
</P>
<P>
   ``His relationship with O'Connor was very professional, but I
don't think it was warm,'' said the Rev. Richard J. Ehrens, an old
friend of Egan who is a priest in Harwood Heights, Ill. ``I think
they just had a mutual tolerance agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Michael Egan grew up in a large, comfortable home in Oak
Park, Ill., the son of Thomas J. and Genevieve Costello Egan. He
had two brothers and a sister. But at 68, he has already suffered
the deaths of his three siblings and his parents.
</P>
<P>
   He decided early on a priestly vocation, attending a junior
seminary before receiving a bachelor's degree in philosophy from
St. Mary of the Lake Seminary, in Mundelein, Ill., and finishing
his studies in Rome at the Pontifical North American College.
</P>
<P>
   He received a theology degree from the Pontifical Gregorian
University, considered one of the best in Rome. On Dec. 15, 1957,
he was ordained there, and returned to Chicago the next year. The
church where he worked so briefly was not just a local parish, but
Holy Name Cathedral in Chicago. But in no time, he was sent to the
chancery offices to assist Cardinal Albert Meyer.
</P>
<P>
   He spent from 1960 to 1964 back in Rome, earning a doctorate in
canon law from Pontifical Gregorian and taking the job of
repetitor, which meant that he would repeat the Latin lectures to
seminarians in English.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The current rector of Pontifical North American, Msgr. Timothy
Dolan, said he was revered by students, and described him as
``lovable and charming, a strong and decisive Irishman _ the kind
who could really touch the heart at a policeman's funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   He spent the next seven years in Chicago, working for Cardinal
John Cody as secretary and co-chancellor, and on commissions on
interfaith relations and social concerns. At one point, Cody named
him to replace an experienced liberal priest as head of a
commission on urban affairs, which meant culling contacts in
minority neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like putting a square peg in a round hole,'' said the
Rev. Thomas Ventura, a priest in Winnetka, Ill. ``If you can
distinguish between a street priest and an office priest, Ed Egan
was an office priest. But in fairness to him, he really worked
hard. It was not his natural milieu, but I think he's a good
soldier and did the best he could.''
</P>
<P>
   From Chicago, Egan was sent again to Rome to be a judge on the
Sacred Roman Rota, a 21-member tribunal of judges who work in
panels of three hearing appeals in many matters of church law,
especially marriage annulments. He also taught canon law at the
Pontifical Gregorian.
</P>
<P>
   During these years he was so immersed in Roman life that once,
as a guest on a television program during a visit back to Chicago,
he had to search for words in English to express himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never seen him at a loss for words, so I said to him,
`Ed, what's going on?''' said his friend, Caplis, the host of the
television show. ``He said: `You know what's happening? I think in
Latin.'''
</P>
<P>
   (At his New York news conference Thursday, Egan answered a
question in English but used an English transliteration of the
Italian word for condoms, ``preservatives,'' to the confusion of
some reporters.)
</P>
<P>
   It was during his years in Rome that Egan once confided his
career strategy to his friend, Ehrens, with whom he vacationed in
Turkey, Greece, Egypt and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always said, `I found it's better not to ask for something
specific, because if you do, you might be sorry that you asked,'''
Ehrens said.
</P>
<P>
   After 14 years in the Vatican, Egan was consecrated a bishop and
sent to New York to serve as an auxiliary to O'Connor, where he was
given the post of vicar for education. He won respect for his focus
on administering Catholic schools.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not hesitate to speak out on public schools,
appearing in 1987 at a contentious City Council hearing about a
proposal to distribute contraceptives in high school health
clinics. He criticized the city's sex education program and
advocated teaching abstinence, telling the council members: ``Try
decency. Try chastity. Try Western civilization,'' instead of
waiting for AIDS ``to put an end to us all.''
</P>
<P>
   As vicar of education, Egan waded into turbulent waters when he
tried to replace the long-serving Catholic chaplains at both
Columbia and New York Universities and replace them with more
conservative clergymen.
</P>
<P>
   Paul E. Dinter, who had served 15 years as chaplain at Columbia,
said that Egan told him to take a sabbatical and that perhaps
afterward the diocese would find him another job. Dinter said the
bishop's approach was ``patronizing, paternalistic,'' and though he
was offended, he decided not to fight it.
</P>
<P>
   Egan also tried to remove the Rev. Raymond Rafferty from the
chaplaincy at New York University. But after the conflict became
public, Egan was overruled by O'Connor, who allowed Rafferty to
stay on for another year and a half, to the cheers of his student
congregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't mind being the bad guy,'' said Dinter, who has left
the priesthood and now runs an education program at the women's
prison in Bedford Hills. ``In a cause he considers right, he will
be a bad guy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Egan spent only a short time in New York, which church
officials say was always the Vatican's intention. After three years
and seven months, he was named bishop of the Diocese of Bridgeport.
</P>
<P>
   The Diocese of Bridgeport is small, home to 360,000 Catholics in
88 parishes, a far more manageable operation than its giant
neighbor to the south, the Archdiocese of New York. The Bridgeport
diocese includes 33 Catholic elementary schools and five high
schools, three nursing facilities, eight homes for the elderly, and
many charitable programs. Although the seat of the diocese is in
struggling Bridgeport, the diocese's borders are also the borders
of Fairfield County, which encompasses wealthy enclaves like
Greenwich, Danbury and Westport.
</P>
<P>
   Egan has spent the last 12 years trying to turn around his
diocese. Friends say that when Egan was installed in Bridgeport in
December 1988, he was shocked to learn just how deeply the diocese
was in debt. Bridgeport was struggling to maintain churches and
schools that depended on dwindling populations of immigrant
Lithuanians, Slovaks, Poles and Italians, who had once been the
mainstays of life in many parishes.
</P>
<P>
   Egan reorganized the school system so that the financing of
schools was shared in common by the entire diocese, and poorer
parishes no longer had to bear the cost of their neighborhood
schools. By pooling the resources, and closing several schools that
were dilapidated or poorly attended, Egan strengthened the
diocese's 38 remaining Catholic schools, say several local Catholic
leaders who have observed the process.
</P>
<P>
   The bishop initiated a fund-raising campaign, beginning in 1995,
that raised $43 million in pledges, of which about $28 million has
been received, said Dr. Joseph McAleer, the diocese's director of
communications. The money has been used to finance seminary
education, open a home for retired clergy, finance Catholic
schools, and to build a substantial endowment. In the past two
years, the diocese has opened two new schools, including the first
Catholic special education school in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept the schools open, and now they're jammed,'' said Msgr.
Stephen DiGiovanni, pastor of St. John the Evangelist Church in
Stamford. ``He set the diocese on a solid financial footing.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Egan has also gained attention for his ability to produce
home-grown Catholic priests in the midst of a severe shortage of
clergymen. He opened the diocese's first seminary residence for
young men considering the priesthood six months after he arrived in
Bridgeport.
</P>
<P>
   The diocese has ordained 52 new priests since the residence
opened, and 30 men are now studying for the priesthood _ a record
that far surpasses the new priests being produced, per capita, in
archdioceses like New York or Boston.
</P>
<P>
   As in many Catholic dioceses, Bridgeport too has been shaken by
lawsuits alleging that priests sexually abused children in churches
and schools. But the small diocese has had up to 30 alleged victims
who have accused eight priests of sexual abuse. The plaintiffs
accuse both Egan and his predecessor, Bishop Walter W. Curtis, of
shuffling clergy pedophiles from one parish to another instead of
confronting the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Most _ but not all _ of the alleged abuse took place before Egan
took office there. But in one case, the plaintiff claims that a
priest who abused him in 1983 was moved by Egan to another parish
in the diocese, when, in 1993, he abused another child. The
lawsuits have dragged on for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   In April this year, the diocese announced that it had settled
one lawsuit for an undisclosed amount. Frank Martinelli had charged
that when he was an altar boy at St. Cecilia Church in Stamford, he
was sexually abused by a priest, the Rev. Lawrence Brett, between
1962 and 1964, and that the diocese covered up the abuse.
Martinelli won a $1 million verdict against the diocese, the
verdict was reversed by an appeals court in 1999, and then the
diocese settled. The diocese asked the court to seal all the
records in this and the other cases.
</P>
<P>
   Egan removed Brett from the priesthood when the lawsuit was
first filed in 1993, and in 1997, after the verdict, publicly
condemned clergy sexual abuse in a letter read during Masses in the
diocese's parishes. But his defense, the same that he used in his
legal deposition, was that priests are independent contractors, and
therefore his diocese was not liable.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy L. Robinson, a partner in the law firm of Tremont &AMP;
Sheldon, which represents 21 people claiming they were abused by
Bridgeport priests, said, ``Neither the bishop nor anyone else in
the diocese has ever offered any counseling or any apology to these
victims, and that we find quite shocking.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to respond, Tom Drohan, a diocesan spokesman, said, ``We
are not going to comment on what we consider less than responsible
comments by plaintiffs' attorneys.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the tests facing Egan in New York is how much latitude he
will give to lay Catholics active in their parishes, and to
Catholic institutions controlled not by the clergy but by
laypeople.
</P>
<P>
   When Egan went to Bridgeport he was surprised to learn that
Sacred Heart University, a Catholic school in Fairfield, was
independent _ a separate corporation run not by the diocese but by
a board of lay people. As bishop, he was chairman of the board, but
his vote counted no more than any of the other 25 board members.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to have that changed. He proposed rewriting the bylaws
so that Sacred Heart University would be owned by the diocese of
Bridgeport. But the university's board voted overwhelmingly against
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was accustomed to being in charge,'' said Dr.
Anthony J. Cernera, president of Sacred Heart, when asked about the
incident. ``An independent university is a standard American model,
but Bishop Egan was coming out of a long experience in Rome where
that's not how it works. But to his credit, he accepted that that's
the reality, and he has worked as very well as a member of the
board in context.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a week of unusually explicit leaks, the Vatican
formally announced Thursday that Bishop Edward Michael Egan of
Bridgeport, Conn., had been chosen the ninth archbishop of New
York, to succeed Cardinal John O'Connor, who died last week at age
80. Egan is to be installed as archbishop on June 19 in a ceremony
at St. Patrick's Cathedral.

</P>
<P>
   The Diocese of Bridgeport is small, home to 360,000 Catholics in
88 parishes, a far more manageable operation than its giant
neighbor to the south, the Archdiocese of New York. The Bridgeport
diocese includes 33 Catholic elementary schools and five high

many charitable programs. Although the seat of the diocese is in
struggling Bridgeport, the diocese's borders are also the borders
of Fairfield County, which encompasses wealthy enclaves like
Greenwich, Danbury and Westport.
</P>
<P>
   As in many Catholic dioceses, Bridgeport has been shaken by
lawsuits alleging that priests sexually abused children in churches
and schools. But the small diocese has had up to 30 alleged victims
who have accused eight priests of sexual abuse. The plaintiffs
accuse both Egan and his predecessor, Bishop Walter W. Curtis, of
shuffling clergy pedophiles from one parish to another instead of
confronting the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Most _ but not all _ of the alleged abuse took place before Egan
took office there. But in one case, the plaintiff claims that a
priest who abused him in 1983 was moved by Egan to another parish
in the diocese, when, in 1993, he abused another child. The
lawsuits have dragged on for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   In April this year, the diocese announced that it had settled
one lawsuit for an undisclosed amount. Frank Martinelli had charged
that when he was an altar boy at St. Cecilia Church in Stamford, he
was sexually abused by a priest, the Rev. Lawrence Brett, between
1962 and 1964, and that the diocese covered up the abuse.
Martinelli won a $1 million verdict against the diocese, the
verdict was reversed by an appeals court in 1999, and then the
diocese settled. The diocese asked the court to seal all the
records in this and the other cases.
</P>
<P>
   Egan removed Brett from the priesthood when the lawsuit was
first filed in 1993, and in 1997, after the verdict, publicly
condemned clergy sexual abuse in a letter read during Masses in the
diocese's parishes. But his defense, the same that he used in his
legal deposition, was that priests are independent contractors, and
therefore his diocese was not liable.

<P>
   It's time for ``Fiscal Jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   The first answer is: About $3.5 trillion, and falling rapidly.

   Well, there are going to be many confusing claims and

<P>
   Vice President Al Gore puts his emphasis on the national debt
held by the public, the $3.5 trillion that the government has
borrowed by selling Treasury securities to individual investors,
banks, pension funds and foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas is taking the view that the
government's obligations include not just the public debt, but also
the special bonds it is issuing to the Social Security system in
ever-growing amounts, representing promises to pay retirement
benefits in decades ahead. By that accounting, the current $5.6
trillion in total debt will grow inexorably for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   The differences are coming into play as the candidates hurtle
into a high-intensity debate about how to shore up Social Security
in time for the aging of the baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has made paying off the entire public debt by 2013 the
centerpiece of his economic agenda. He wants to use excess Social
Security revenue _ more than $2 trillion over the next decade _ to
do it.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would then channel the interest savings from debt reduction
to Social Security, in effect committing trillions of dollars of
general tax revenue to keep the system afloat. In that way, he
would extend the system's solvency from 2037 to around 2050 without
cutting benefits, raising payroll taxes or altering the way Social
Security works.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to helping deal with Social Security in a relatively
painless way, Gore's plan would free up trillions of dollars for
other kinds of investment, helping to put downward pressure on
interest rates and create new economic opportunities for companies
and individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's approach is different. This week he plans to set out a
goal of adding private investment accounts to Social Security, a
major change that would require hundreds of billions, if not
trillions, of dollars over the next decade. The only place to find
that money is the Social Security surplus.
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that the surplus is used to finance private
accounts, it would not be available to reduce the public debt, a
goal in which Gore sees both economic logic and considerable
political appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's team argues that reducing the public debt is not the
only way to improve the government's financial condition. Because
the private investment accounts would replace part of the
government's obligation to pay Social Security benefits in the long
run, his approach would in effect reduce the debt, broadly defined.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be improving the government's balance sheet in an even
more efficient way,'' said Lawrence Lindsey, the former Federal
Reserve governor who is Bush's chief economic adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The scale of any reduction in total debt under Bush's approach
would depend on the amount of money committed to the private
accounts, a decision that Bush says should be made through
bipartisan negotiations after he is elected.
</P>
<P>
   Under Gore's approach, the public debt would sink steadily, but
all the while the Treasury's obligation to the Social Security
trust fund would be rising even faster, from $855 billion today to
$4.2 trillion in 2013. So even if the public debt is retired on
Gore's schedule, the total debt would rise, from $5.6 trillion
today to $6.8 trillion in 2013.
</P>
<P>
   The two plans are pretty much a wash when it comes to improving
national savings. ``Whether you're taking $100 billion and buying
down debt or adding it to a pool of private funds available for
investment doesn't make a great deal of difference,'' said Robert
Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute and a former director
of the Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's approach is conservative in the sense that it is based on
debt reduction, but it affirms Democratic orthodoxy by retaining
Social Security as a guaranteed benefit, even if tax revenue must
pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush bucks mainstream economic thinking to a degree when he
plays down the importance of wiping out the public debt. But at
heart, his plan is about transferring some control of retirement
finances from the government to individuals _ a most basic
conservative value.
</P>
<P>
   We'll be back with the final round of ``Fiscal Jeopardy'' in
November, when the voters will decide. &QL;

<P>
   Eric Lindros, the Philadelphia Flyers' star center, has missed
the first two rounds of the Stanley Cup playoffs and will not be on
the ice Sunday when his team faces the New Jersey Devils in the
first game of the National Hockey League's Eastern Conference
finals.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros, in fact, may not return again this season because of a
severe concussion two months ago, and his athletic future is in
doubt. His ordeal began in March, when for nine days after an
opponent elbowed him in the head, team trainers and doctors gave
Lindros ibuprofen and head massages _ even though he had suffered
three previous concussions and says he complained daily of
headaches, nausea and, eventually, memory loss.
</P>
<P>
   He played in four games before he was finally sent to a Chicago
neurologist, who said he had sustained a severe concussion. Lindros
said he had longed for the team to take him off the ice, but could
not bring himself to ask. There is an unwritten code of stoicism
among hockey players, as there is in football, boxing and other
contact sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to explain my symptoms and that things were not real
good, but I was not going to pull myself out of the game,'' Lindros
told reporters. ``I was hoping the team would take me out, knowing
what went on and expressing to them for days about my headaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, athletes like Lindros shrugged off
concussions as a minor injury. Football players derisively called
them ``dings'' or ``getting your bell rung.'' Only in recent years
have scientists begun to understand what happens to the brain when
it is severely shaken: how one concussion, if not given time to
heal, can make an athlete more vulnerable to others, and how
multiple concussions can lead to permanent brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year alone, elite football quarterbacks like Steve
Young and Troy Aikman have been laid out unconscious on the field,
and hockey players like Lindros have been dazed after collisions on
the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Concussions remain one of the most dangerous and perplexing
injuries in sports, an invisible and unpredictable wound that has
curtailed the careers of some of North America's greatest sports
heroes, from Roger Staubach of the Dallas Cowboys to Pat LaFontaine
of the New York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   And even though awareness about the danger of multiple
concussions has grown, athletes, agents, trainers and coaches on
all levels of sports are still struggling with how to cope with the
injury.
</P>
<P>
   While researchers have not been able to answer definitively how
long it takes the human brain to heal, the American Academy of
Neurology has devised broad guidelines on when it is safe for an
athlete to return to play. But trainers and team physicians,
especially at the professional level, disagree about what
guidelines, if any, should be followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply don't have a standardized diagnostic technique and
that means it's sort of done on a hit-and-miss basis,'' said Leigh
Steinberg, an agent who represents 140 professional athletes,
including 22 pro quarterbacks. ``We need to have some consensus on
when it's acceptable to have a player put back into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the National Football League nor the National Hockey
League has endorsed guidelines on returning to play after a
concussion; both leagues leave such decisions up to team trainers
and doctors. There are about 160 concussions in the NFL and 70 in
the NHL each year, league officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, all NHL teams and about two-thirds of NFL teams have
tested players' cognitive skills at the beginning of a season so
trainers have a baseline against which to measure a player after a
concussion. The NHL encourages teams to keep players off the ice
until they regain the mental skills they had before injury.
</P>
<P>
   But in practice these decisions are still made on a case by case
basis, usually by trainers and team doctors who are not
neurologists, according to players and union and league officials.
Sometimes mistakes are made.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a fool-proof program yet,'' said Tim Wharnsby, a
spokesman for the NHL Players Association.
</P>
<P>
   One major problem is that athletes face enormous pressure to
continue playing, not only from peers, who sometimes ridicule them
for being weak, but also from coaches and owners, who at times
place the team's immediate needs above the athlete's long-term
health, many players said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have guidelines,'' said Merril Hoge, a football
analyst for ESPN and a former Chicago Bears running back who had to
retire after two concussions in 1994. ``There is an enormous amount
of pressure on the player, the owner and the doctor to get that
player back out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindros Diagnosis Slow in Coming  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lindros faced precisely that pressure, people close to him said.
After being hit in the second period of a game against the Boston
Bruins on March 4, his vision faded to yellow and he sat out a
shift on the ice. Between the second and third periods, he vomited
in the dressing room. Both symptoms were clear signs of concussion,
doctors say. He also told trainers that he had a headache and was
given heat packs as a remedy.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next nine days, he complained daily to the the team's
trainer, John Worley, of severe headaches, Lindros' lawyer and
others close to him said. He was treated with over-the-counter
analgesics and massages before games.
</P>
<P>
   Eight days after the injury, the team finally sent him to a
dentist, out of concern that his jaw might have been injured. The
following day, he played a game in Denver. He said later he could
not remember what he was supposed to do on his shifts.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the training staff, in consultation with a team
doctor, decided Lindros was suffering from migraines and put him on
the disabled list. They sent him to a Philadelphia neurologist, Dr.
Stephen Silberstein, who specializes in headaches. Silberstein said
the root of Lindros' symptoms had been a concussion and, after
treating him for the migraines, sent him to Chicago to see Dr.
James Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Kelly is one of a handful of neurologists who have studied
sports concussions and who spearheaded efforts by the American
Academy of Neurology in 1997 to come up with a consensus on
guidelines for returning to play. The guidelines were intended to
help coaches and doctors avoid catastrophic head injuries to
players.
</P>
<P>
   After two days of examinations, Kelly said Lindros' concussion
had been more severe than Silberstein thought. Given the player's
history of past concussions, Kelly prescribed a long rest until his
symptoms disappeared completely.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros, who declined to be interviewed for this article, is
still trying to fight his way back. But he has clearly become more
vulnerable to brain injuries. On May 5, in his first scrimmage
during rehabilitation, Lindros suffered yet another concussion _
his third this year _ when he collided with a defenseman. Lindros
was hit in his jaw and mouth, and again suffered headaches and
other symptoms. He will be sidelined for at least another two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said Lindros had risked a more serious injury by
continuing to skate for four games after the concussion in early
March. ``His symptoms worsened because of returning too early,''
Kelly said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Zack Hill, a spokesman for the Flyers, declined repeated
requests for interviews with the team's doctors, trainers or other
team officials.
</P>
<P>
   But Worley, the Flyers' trainer, defended his decisions in
comments to the Philadelphia Daily News; he said Lindros had
complained of nothing worse than headaches and had told trainers he
was feeling better throughout the week after the injury. ``I feel
confident in the decisions that were made with the information we
were all presented with,'' Worley said.

<P>
   `Sort of Like A Small Seizure'  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Concussions in contact sports have been around since the first
pugilists and wrestlers began competing thousands of years ago.
More than 300,000 people sustain them in sporting events in the
United States each year, federal epidemiologists say. But it is
only in the last 15 years that neurologists have begun to
understand what happens when the brain is severely shaken.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to popular belief, a concussion is not a bruise to the
brain caused by hitting a hard surface. Indeed, no physical
swelling or bleeding is usually seen on radiological scans. The
injury generally occurs when the head either accelerates rapidly
and then is stopped, or is spun rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   This violent shaking causes the brain cells to become
depolarized and fire all their neurotransmitters at once in an
unhealthy cascade, flooding the brain with chemicals and deadening
certain receptors linked to learning and memory. The results often
include confusion, blurred vision, memory loss, nausea and,
sometimes, unconsciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sort of like a small seizure,'' said Dr. David A. Hovda,
the director of the Brain Injury Research Center at the University
of California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Hovda's research with rats suggests that it takes tremendous
energy for the brain to correct the chemical imbalance. The
chemical changes associated with even a minor concussion in rats
last at least 10 days, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hovda and other researchers say changes to the human brain start
to resolve themselves immediately, but the recovery time seems to
vary. It depends not only on the severity of the blow, they say,
but also on how many previous concussions a person has suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Neurologists say that once a person suffers a concussion, he is
as much as four times more likely to sustain a second one.
Moreover, after several concussions, it takes less of a blow to
cause the injury and requires more time to recover.
</P>
<P>
   In some instances, athletes suffer a second concussion before
their brain has recovered from the first. In rare cases, the second
injury can lead to what doctors call second impact syndrome, in
which massive swelling of the brain causes pressure inside the
skull that chokes off the flow of fresh blood and leads to death or
irreparable brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   It was concern over second impact syndrome among adolescents
that led Kelly and several other prominent neurologists to push the
American Academy of Neurology to establish guidelines for returning
to play.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines divide concussions into three grades of severity,
with a prolonged knockout being the worst. In essence, the academy
recommends that athletes whose symptoms _ headaches, nausea,
amnesia, blurred vision _ do not clear up within fifteen minutes,
or who lose consciousness even briefly, be kept out of competition
until their symptoms have disappeared completely for at least a
week.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors on an NFL committee that is studying concussions, as
well as many team doctors and trainers, have criticized these
guidelines, saying they are not supported by research. ``We don't
know whether being knocked out briefly is any more dangerous than
having amnesia and not being knocked out,'' said Mark R. Lovell, a
neurologist at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit who is a
consultant for both the NFL and the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see people all the time that get knocked out briefly and
have no symptoms,'' he added. ``Others get elbowed, go back to the
bench and say where am I?''
</P>
<P>
   Lovell says that because each brain is organized differently,
every athlete responds differently to brain injuries. This explains
why some boxers have a glass jaw, while others can take immense
punishment without being knocked out.
</P>
<P>
   Lovell designed the neuropsychological testing programs used by
the NFL and the NHL. He advocates that team doctors evaluate
players before the season and then after each concussion, looking
for slight changes in memory and information processing speed.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the NFL committee is Dr. Elliott Pellman, an
internist who is team doctor for the Jets and the Islanders.
Pellman also contends that so little is known about concussions
that one-size-fits-all guidelines make no sense. He says team
doctors should be allowed to use ``the art of medicine'' to
determine when a player is ready to return after a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really have to hope that the doctors that deal with this
have a lot of experience with it, use the tools available and are
not affected by the outside din,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pellman said his committee had overseen a study to discover what
sort of football collisions cause concussions, using computerized
analysis of game footage and crash-test dummies to recreate
collisions. The study's preliminary findings suggest that most
football concussions happen during head-to-head collisions and that
blows to the ear are especially likely to produce concussions,
Pellman said. He said the hope is to eventually pressure equipment
manufacturers to devise safer helmets.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other research has suggested even soccer players are prone to
head injuries. A recent Dutch study that compared 53 professional
soccer players to 27 elite runners and swimmers showed the soccer
players had impaired cognitive skills compared to the other
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Among professional football and hockey teams, Pellman said, the
awareness of the problem has grown. ``I think everyone is
profoundly careful now, maybe even too cautious, because nobody
wants to make a mistake,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kelly, who is also a consultant for the Bears, says the
pre-season neuropsychological testing is not being done uniformly
across the NFL and that some teams have refused to participate. Nor
are all trainers as diligent about checking for concussions as they
should be, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some football trainers send people who are unconscious back
into a game,'' he said. ``What is it going to take to get these
guys on board?''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks Are Highly Vulnerable  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no position is sports is associated with concussions
more than quarterback. Two of the NFL's premier quarterbacks, Steve
Young of the San Francisco 49ers and Troy Aikman of the Dallas
Cowboys, were forced out by concussions last season.
</P>
<P>
   Young, 37, was sidelined for most of the season after sustaining
a concession in late September, his fourth in three years. He is
still pondering whether to continue playing, people close to him
said. Aikman sat out two games last November after he suffered
concussions in two consecutive weeks. He has had six in his
professional career, but never previously missed a game because of
a concussion and says he does not intend to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Young nor Aikman was willing to be interviewed about
their injuries. Their silence is a measure of both the macho
culture of football and, people close to the quarterbacks say, the
fear that talking publicly about their concussions makes them even
more vulnerable to defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes them a target on the field,'' said Steinberg, the
agent who represents Aikman and Young.
</P>
<P>
   But other football players whose careers have already been ended
said that for many years the injury had not been considered very
important. Some said the guidelines Kelly and others have proposed
would have helped extend their playing days.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Al Toon, once a mercurial wide receiver for the New York Jets,
said it was not uncommon for him to play the week following a
concussion. He retired in November 1992, after neurologists
informed him that his cognitive skills were deteriorating. He said
at the time that he had endured as many as 10 concussions. Not only
was it taking longer and longer to recover after each one, but the
threat of permanent damage loomed large in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically I played the next week,'' he said. ``It didn't feel
like I was doing something detrimental in the long term. But it
took less and less of a blow to create the same amount of impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Toon, who now owns real estate and a bank in Madison, Wis., said
that for four years after he retired he had trouble remembering
information and focusing on events around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a dark and gloomy low point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A study presented last week at the American Academy of
Neurology's annual meeting suggested that many retired football
players endure similar symptoms. Researchers surveyed 1,090 former
NFL players and found more than 60 percent had suffered at least
one concussion in their careers and 26 percent had had three or
more. Those who had had concussions reported more problems with
memory, concentration, speech impediments, headaches and other
neurological problems than those who had not, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   Some former players remain bitter about their treatment. Hoge
said team doctors in Chicago allowed him to play the following week
after he suffered a severe concussion in a preseason game against
Kansas City in August 1994. The Bears never gave him a
neuropsychological examination, he said, and the team doctor
approved his return to play after a telephone conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been treated as no big deal,'' Hoge said. ``At the
very least you need an expert evaluation.''
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks later, he was hammered on a tackle in a game against
Buffalo and collapsed on the next down. His vital signs vanished
for a few seconds. He spent two days in an intensive care unit, and
was told by neurologists that his eight-year career was over.
</P>
<P>
   For a year, Hoge said, he could not stand bright lights and had
dizzy spells. He struggled with arithmetic and reading was
difficult. He also had no sense of direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the most helpless feelings I ever dealt with,'' he
said. ``I would get lost in my own neighborhood.''

   Seven Concussions And Retirement  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pat LaFontaine, the former star of the New York Islanders, New
York Rangers and Buffalo Sabres, knows precisely what Lindros is
going through. In October 1996, he suffered a concussion when a
defenseman knocked him off his feet. He slammed his forehead into
the ice and lost consciousness for several seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't remember anything until sitting in the training
room looking up at the TV and it was the last period,'' he recalled
in a recent interview. ``My memory recall was blocked out for 45
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the sixth concussion of his career. The team doctor let
LaFontaine back on the ice the following week, but he could barely
play. LaFontaine said he could not sleep and suffered migraines. He
found he could not keep up with the play on the ice. After he
soldiered through six games, he went into a team executive's office
and, in his words, ``broke down.''
</P>
<P>
   Neurologists determined he was suffering from the effects of
multiple concussions. ``I shouldn't have been doing anything for at
least three weeks,'' LaFontaine said. ``Every doctor said just be
thankful you didn't get hit during those three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   It took LaFontaine six months to recover. For weeks he would not
leave the house or shower. When the symptoms vanished, he said, it
was as if someone plugged in a telephone line again.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, he tried to make a comeback, signing with
the Rangers. He played 67 games, but then collided with a teammate
and received another concussion. It took several months to recover,
so in the summer of 1998, he decided to hang up his skates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is the minute a concussion occurs it has to be
dealt with,'' he said. ``The symptoms have to be cleared for at
least a week.''

   ATLANTA _TV's rush to report what happened inside the
camera-free courtroom on Thursday was apparent when WXIA's Jon
Shirek appeared outside as soon as the Gonzalez hearing ended, but
was too breathless to give a full report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me catch my breath,'' he huffed to streetside colleague
Ken Watts. He then moved off camera to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   Shirek returned moments later, still looking over notes as he
described what he'd seen from his seat inside.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's three other local stations followed WXIA, breaking
into their regular programming for varying lengths of time.
</P>
<P>
   With few compelling images and the media dominating the scene,
there were times when one station's cameras showed another station
doing its report.
</P>
<P>
   WXIA's high, overview lens looked down on narrow Forsyth Street,
on a small circle where a reporter stood talking directly into a
camera. A quick surf to WSB, and there was the reporter: Richard
Belcher, giving his level-headed analysis of what went on inside.
</P>
<P>
   The most breathless local coverage belonged to WGNX.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a wild day!'' exclaimed anchor Helen Neill,
hours before the hearing began. Meteorologist Laura Huckabee
worried about the effect of forecasted hot and sticky weather on
demonstrators. ``Makes you cranky,'' she noted. And while other
stations reported that the early crowd was subdued and made up
mostly of other media, anchor Steve Johns let viewers know from his
studio seat, ``You can really hear activity picking up out there.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN's Martin Savidge, shortly after the hearing began at 9 a.m.,
caught himself before falling into the same kind of hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a large crowd _ actually, it was a relatively large
crowd,'' Savidge corrected himself.
</P>
<P>
   While the Gonzalez case has been the national media's ground
zero for months, it became just another story on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The network newscasts largely played it behind the wildfires in
New Mexico and New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani's separation from his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   Fox News anchor Brit Hume sounded tired of the whole thing when
he introduced the political asylum story: ``More on little Elian's
excellent adventure. . .''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Eric Lindros, the Philadelphia Flyers' star center, has missed
the first two rounds of the Stanley Cup playoffs and will not be on
the ice Sunday when his team faces the New Jersey Devils in the
first game of the National Hockey League's Eastern Conference
finals.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros, in fact, may not return again this season because of a
severe concussion two months ago, and his athletic future is in
doubt. His ordeal began in March, when for nine days after an
opponent elbowed him in the head, team trainers and doctors gave
Lindros ibuprofen and head massages _ even though he had suffered
three previous concussions and says he complained daily of
headaches, nausea and, eventually, memory loss.
</P>
<P>
   He played in four games before he was finally sent to a Chicago
neurologist, who said he had sustained a severe concussion. Lindros
said he had longed for the team to take him off the ice, but could
not bring himself to ask. There is an unwritten code of stoicism
among hockey players, as there is in football, boxing and other
contact sports.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, athletes like Lindros shrugged off
concussions as a minor injury. Football players derisively called
them ``dings'' or ``getting your bell rung.'' Only in recent years
have scientists begun to understand what happens to the brain when
it is severely shaken: how one concussion, if not given time to
heal, can make an athlete more vulnerable to others, and how
multiple concussions can lead to permanent brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year alone, elite football quarterbacks like Steve
Young and Troy Aikman have been laid out unconscious on the field,
and hockey players like Lindros have been dazed after collisions on
the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Concussions remain one of the most dangerous and perplexing
injuries in sports, an invisible and unpredictable wound that has
curtailed the careers of some of North America's greatest sports
heroes, from Roger Staubach of the Dallas Cowboys to Pat LaFontaine
of the New York Rangers. &UR;  &LR; Brett Lindros, Eric's brother, also
retired after suffering several concussions while playing for the
New York Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   And even though awareness about the danger of multiple
concussions has grown, athletes, agents, trainers and coaches on
all levels of sports are still struggling with how to cope with the
injury.
</P>
<P>
   While researchers have not been able to answer definitively how
long it takes the human brain to heal, the American Academy of
Neurology has devised broad guidelines on when it is safe for an
athlete to return to play. But trainers and team physicians,
especially at the professional level, disagree about what
guidelines, if any, should be followed.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the National Football League nor the National Hockey
League has endorsed guidelines on returning to play after a
concussion; both leagues leave such decisions up to team trainers
and doctors. There are about 160 concussions in the NFL and 70 in
the NHL each year, league officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, all NHL teams and about two-thirds of NFL teams have
tested players' cognitive skills at the beginning of a season so
trainers have a baseline against which to measure a player after a
concussion. The NHL encourages teams to keep players off the ice
until they regain the mental skills they had before injury.
</P>
<P>
   But in practice these decisions are still made on a case by case
basis, usually by trainers and team doctors who are not
neurologists. Sometimes mistakes are made.
</P>
<P>
   One major problem is that athletes face enormous pressure to
continue playing, not only from peers, who sometimes ridicule them
for being weak, but also from coaches and owners, who at times
place the team's immediate needs above the athlete's long-term
health.
</P>
<P>
   Concussions in contact sports have been around since the first
pugilists and wrestlers began competing thousands of years ago.
More than 300,000 people sustain them in sporting events in the
United States each year. But it is only in the last 15 years that
neurologists have begun to understand what happens when the brain
is severely shaken.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to popular belief, a concussion is not a bruise to the
brain caused by hitting a hard surface. Indeed, no physical
swelling or bleeding is usually seen on radiological scans. The
injury generally occurs when the head either accelerates rapidly
and then is stopped, or is spun rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This violent shaking causes the brain cells to become
depolarized and fire all their neurotransmitters at once in an
unhealthy cascade, flooding the brain with chemicals and deadening
certain receptors linked to learning and memory. The results often
include confusion, blurred vision, memory loss, nausea and,
sometimes, unconsciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say changes to the human brain start to resolve
themselves immediately, but the recovery time seems to vary. It
depends not only on the severity of the blow, they say, but also on
how many previous concussions a person has suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Neurologists say that once a person suffers a concussion, he is
as much as four times more likely to sustain a second one.
Moreover, after several concussions, it takes less of a blow to
cause the injury and requires more time to recover.
</P>
<P>
   In some instances, athletes suffer a second concussion before
their brain has recovered from the first. In rare cases, the second
injury can lead to what doctors call second impact syndrome, in
which massive swelling of the brain causes pressure inside the
skull that chokes off the flow of fresh blood and leads to death or
irreparable brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Kelly of Chicago, who treated Lindros, is one of a
handful of neurologists who have studied sports concussions and who
spearheaded efforts by the American Academy of Neurology in 1997 to
develop a consensus on guidelines for returning to play. The
guidelines were intended to help coaches and doctors avoid
catastrophic head injuries to players.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines divide concussions into three grades of severity,
with a prolonged knockout being the worst. In essence, the academy
recommends that athletes whose symptoms _ headaches, nausea,
amnesia, blurred vision _ do not clear up within fifteen minutes,
or who lose consciousness even briefly, be kept out of competition
until their symptoms have disappeared completely for at least a
week.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors on an NFL committee that is studying concussions, as
well as many team doctors and trainers, have criticized these
guidelines, saying they are not supported by research. ``We don't
know whether being knocked out briefly is any more dangerous than
having amnesia and not being knocked out,'' said Mark R. Lovell, a
neurologist at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit who is a
consultant for both the NFL and the NHL
</P>
<P>
   ``We see people all the time that get knocked out briefly and
have no symptoms,'' he added. ``Others get elbowed, go back to the
bench and say where am I?''
</P>
<P>
   Lovell says that because each brain is organized differently,
every athlete responds differently to brain injuries. This explains
why some boxers have a glass jaw, while others can take immense
punishment without being knocked out.
</P>
<P>
   Lovell designed the neuropsychological testing programs used by
the NFL and the NHL. He advocates that team doctors evaluate
players before the season and then after each concussion, looking
for slight changes in memory and information processing speed.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the NFL committee is Dr. Elliott Pellman, an
internist who is team doctor for the Jets and the Islanders.
Pellman also contends that so little is known about concussions
that one-size-fits-all guidelines make no sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really have to hope that the doctors that deal with this
have a lot of experience with it, use the tools available and are
not affected by the outside din,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pellman said his committee had overseen a study to discover what
sort of football collisions cause concussions, using computerized
analysis of game footage and crash-test dummies to recreate
collisions. The study's preliminary findings suggest that most
football concussions happen during head-to-head collisions and that
blows to the ear are especially likely to produce concussions,
Pellman said. He said the hope is to eventually pressure equipment
manufacturers to devise safer helmets.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly says the pre-season neuropsychological testing is not
being done uniformly across the NFL and that some teams have
refused to participate. Nor are all trainers as diligent about
checking for concussions as they should be, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no position is sports is associated with concussions
more than quarterback. Two of the NFL's premier quarterbacks, Steve
Young of the San Francisco 49ers and Troy Aikman of the Dallas
Cowboys, were forced out by concussions last season.
</P>
<P>
   Young, 37, was sidelined for most of the season after sustaining
a concession in late September, his fourth in three years. Aikman
sat out two games last November after he suffered concussions in
two consecutive weeks. He has had six in his professional career,
but never previously missed a game because of a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Young nor Aikman was willing to be interviewed about
their injuries. Their silence is a measure of both the macho
culture of football and, people close to the quarterbacks say, the
fear that talking publicly about their concussions makes them even
more vulnerable to defenders.
</P>
<P>
   But other football players whose careers have already been ended
said that for many years the injury had not been considered very
important. Some said the guidelines Kelly and others have proposed
would have helped extend their playing days.
</P>
<P>
   For a study presented last week at the American Academy of
Neurology's annual meeting, researchers surveyed 1,090 former NFL
players and found more than 60 percent had suffered at least one
concussion in their careers and 26 percent had had three or more.
Those who had had concussions reported more problems with memory,
concentration, speech impediments, headaches and other neurological
problems than those who had not, the survey found.

OVERWHELMED SOUTHWEST JUDGES ASK FOR HELP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal courts in Texas and other Southwestern
border states have become overburdened by a dramatic increase in
illegal-immigration and drug-related prosecutions in recent years,
judges from the region told Congress on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The seven jurists, in a rare personal lobbying effort by sitting
judges, urged federal lawmakers to add judgeships and increase
funding for the courts to lighten the workload.
</P>
<P>
   The judicial docket is especially large in South and West Texas,
where too few judges are being called upon to handle too many
criminal cases, said Carolyn Dineen King, chief judge of the New
Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get some help,'' said King, who led the delegation
of judges from five courts in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and
California. ``Someone has to speak. Someone has to say this isn't
working.''
</P>
<P>
   King said judges and court employees have been working longer
hours to handle the explosion in prosecutions. Civil attorneys and
their clients, meanwhile, have had to wait much longer than usual
to have their lawsuits heard by judges who are constitutionally
bound to ensure that criminal defendants receive a speedy trial,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   King, who oversees the administration of federal courts in
Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, said she has had to shuffle
judges in the three states to ensure that criminal defendants have
not languished in jail due to the massive backlog or have been set
free too early.
</P>
<P>
   She said she too often has had to send jurists with a relatively
light workload to South and West Texas to help judges there handle
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're managing to tough it out,'' she said. But this temporary
fix will soon fail unless Congress increases the number of judges
and provides more funding for courts, King told lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Gonzalez, D-Texas, expressed strong support for the
judges' call for congressional help but said his colleagues from
states not on the Southwestern border might be less willing to
confront the regional problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing fair about the process up here,'' Gonzalez
said. ``The interest (in border issues) diminishes as you start
going north.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gonzalez said the judges certainly have the backing of
lawmakers from Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California.
</P>
<P>
   The additional burden on the courts affects not only judges but
court staff, including law clerks, U.S., marshals and federal
public defenders, who must often toil longer hours to handle the
workload, King said. In addition, federal detention centers often
fill to capacity, requiring defendants to be held in state-run
facilities hundreds of miles from the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   King and her fellow judges pinned much of the blame for their
increased workload on a Congress intent on stopping illegal
immigration and drug smuggling but unwilling to ensure that U.S.
courts can handle the resulting rise in prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   While funding a 99 percent increase in Border Patrol agents
since 1994, lawmakers have been reluctant to raise the number of
federal judges or increase court funding along the border, the
judges said.
</P>
<P>
   George Kazen, chief judge of the U.S. District Court for
Southern Texas, called on lawmakers to pay as much attention to
prosecuting as they do to catching criminals at the border.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said the costs will only increase in his court as U.S.
attorneys, with Texas Attorney General John Cornyn's approval,
press ahead with plans to prosecute in federal court defendants who
allegedly commit crimes with a gun. The plan, dubbed ``Texas
Exile'' and inaugurated in January, takes advantage of a strict
federal law that demands that gun-toting criminals face at least
five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S. District Court for Southern Texas, which covers
Houston and points south, the number of criminal cases filed rose
145 percent, to 3,387, between 1995 and 1999 while the number of
judges remained steady at 18.
</P>
<P>
   The five U.S. district courts in South and West Texas, New
Mexico, Arizona and Southern California handled 26 percent of the
59,923 federal court criminal filings last year. The rest of the
cases were divided among the 89 other district courts nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   King has a strong ally. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, in a Jan. 1 statement on
the judiciary, urged Congress to assign the five district courts
more judges, citing their ``unmanageable number of immigration and
drug-related cases.'' He specifically said the court in South Texas
needs two more judges.
</P>
<P>
   As for court funding, the federal judiciary is urging lawmakers
to increase its $4.3 billion budget by $363 million, or 8.5
percent, next year. But legislation pending in the House would
provide no increase.

RANGERS SHOW MAJOR DOSES OF TOUGHNESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hockey players are tough, or so we are told.
</P>
<P>
   They whack each other with sticks, pound each other into the
boards and usually walk away from the game with only a handful of
teeth. Never mind they play two or three times a week and there's
usually a line shift every two or three minutes. Hockey players are
tough.
</P>
<P>
   Football players are tough, or so we are told. They block and
tackle and maim the quarterback and usually undergo a half-dozen
knee surgeries during the course of their career. Never mind they
play once a week and are covered with pads and helmets, some
players using Novocain and cortizone shots to dull pain.
</P>
<P>
   Football players are tough.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball players aren't tough, or so we are told. They have a
great union and multimillion dollar contracts, and knowledgeable
writers such as George Will and Doris Kearns Goodwin wax poetic
about emerald grass and blue skies. Never mind they play 162 games
and a 95-mph fastball in the back hurts like ...
</P>
<P>
   Baseball players aren't tough.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was David Segui standing at first base Sunday, playing
in obvious pain because of a strained hip flexor. Of course
football players don't get strained hip flexors; they get broken
jaws and fractured ribs. But anyone who saw Segui limping around
the clubhouse could tell that he should have either taken the day
off or been used at designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   The same probably could have been said for Luis Alicea, who was
still recovering from a strained calf muscle. But the DH spot was
occupied by Rafael Palmeiro, who has a strained left hamstring
muscle, which keeps him running full speed but doesn't keep him
from hitting home runs or driving in runs. Why should it? He almost
won the Most Valuable Player Award in 1999 despite undergoing two
knee operations within two months at the start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro's bat is so valuable that manager Johnny Oates won't
let him play first base until he's as close to 100 percent as
possible. So that left Segui to hobble out to first base all this
week, showing some of the physical toughness that baseball players
aren't noted for.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a gamer,'' hitting coach Rudy Jaramillo said. ``I love
his intensity and his fire. Raffy is the same way. The hamstring is
bothering him just as much as the knee was last year but he refuses
to come out. He's in there every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his injury, Segui said, ``I don't want to talk about
it. Does it really matter?''
</P>
<P>
   Anybody who has watched the Rangers closely knows it matters a
great deal. His two-run game-winning home run on Wednesday was
spectacular; but even before that, Segui's steady stream of two-run
singles and doubles into the gap had become an indispensable part
of the Rangers' offense. If he doesn't make it out to first base
this week, the Rangers are in deep trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of toughness, anybody who has seen Rick Helling's
swollen right hand would also marvel at how he held the Seattle
Mariners scoreless for four innings this week after getting hit by
Tom Lampkin's line drive. Yet if he comes out of that ballgame
early Monday, the Rangers' overworked bullpen is handed an even
greater burden.
</P>
<P>
   This is an extraordinary time for the Rangers. They have more
than a half-dozen key players either on the disabled list or
playing with injuries; their bullpen is sagging from overwork and
Oates doesn't know from game to game if he needs another infielder,
outfielder or pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing he really knows for sure is catcher Ivan
Rodriguez is willing to put the gear on game after game, endure the
physical abuse of one of the most demanding positions in all of
sports and still put up extraordinary offensive numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet somehow during this difficult period, the Rangers have won
seven of 10 going into last night's game against the Anaheim
Angels.
</P>
<P>
   They might not be hockey players or football stars beating each
other senseless but anybody paying attention ought to understand
that the one thing the Rangers have going for themselves right now
is sheer physical toughness.

COWBOYS PLAYERS A HIT IN NFL EUROPE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Cowboys wide receiver Jeff Ogden, now a
starring member of the Rhein Fire in NFL Europe, hasn't had nearly
as much trouble catching passes from Danny Wuerffel this spring as
he has had in trying to find a jar of peanut butter in Dusseldorf,
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Ogden, the Cowboys' fourth or fifth receiver and occasional
return man each of the past two seasons, currently ranks in the top
four among NFL Europe leaders in receptions (20), receiving yards
(276) and a league-high four touchdowns through the first four
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Duane Hawthorne, another Dallas player on loan to NFL
Europe, is tied for the league lead with three interceptions for
the Scottish Claymores.
</P>
<P>
   Ogden and Hawthorne, who are coming off NFL Europe Player of the
Week honors on their respective sides of the ball, meet Saturday
for the league lead in a game to be played at Dusseldorf. Both
teams are 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like the biggest thing going on here. We feel Ogden is
their go-to guy ... and I'll try not to let him catch too many
passes out there,'' said Hawthorne, who is playing right cornerback
for the Claymores after an impressive 1999 season with three
interceptions for the Cowboys as an undrafted rookie free agent
from Northern Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither player has Internet access in Europe, Ogden and
Hawthorne are both aware that the Cowboys have made significant
changes at receiver and cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother, David, who lives in St. Louis, tells me pretty
much what's going on,'' said Hawthorne. ``Like he told that Kevin
Mathis was gone \Rtraded to New Orleans\S. And as far as \Rthe
Cowboys drafting three cornerbacks\S, I knew that was a key area to
address this off-season. I can't worry about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Ogden and Hawthorne welcome the change in being able to
play almost every down in NFL Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are games when I get 70 reps,'' said Ogden, who has
averaged only 10 catches for 103.5 yards and no TDs over the past
two seasons with the Cowboys. ``This allows you to get a feel for
the game. It also eases your anxiety a little bit and allows you to
be more creative out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ogden will have to vacate his Dusseldorf hotel next week and
move into a ``dorm room at the YMCA or something'' because of
convention coming to town.
</P>
<P>
   So, he plans to take two week's worth of dirty laundry with him
because he hasn't been able to find a laundromat, either.

RANGERS HOPING YOUTH WILL SERVE ANOTHER TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON _ Former Rangers manager Kevin Kennedy had a favorite
postgame phrase whenever one of his players made an especially
egregious mistake, particularly when it cost his team a chance to
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't player development,'' Kennedy would say, implying
that the offending player would find himself on the bench or
perhaps back in the minors if they didn't improve.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing that Kennedy isn't in charge of this year's
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The lineup, when everyone is healthy, includes two rookies _
center fielder Ruben Mateo and third baseman Mike Lamb _ a
second-year player, right fielder Gabe Kapler and a rookie utility
player, Scott Sheldon. There's two more rookies on the pitching
staff _ starter Doug Davis and reliever Francisco Cordero _ and two
more second-year players _ Jeff Zimmerman and Mike Venafro _ in the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   They are players who won't hear any Kennedy-esque pronouncements
from manager Johnny Oates when they err. Instead they are getting
the opportunity to play through mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, you have to develop some players,'' Oates said.
``That's what's going on. You're trying to develop people, and
you're trying to win games at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is the tricky part.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers want to win the American League West for the fourth
time in five seasons. But they're also committed to the youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the minor leagues,'' Oates said. ``We can win and
develop at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a theory that Oates is determined to test, even through
mistakes like Mateo failing to slide into second base on a force
play on Wednesday, like missed signs, like throwing to the wrong
base, like hanging sliders and grooved fastballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really worried about the next 140 ballgames,'' Oates
said. ``I want to win every ballgame I play, but there's certain
areas we need to look at. Ruben Mateo is going to play center
field. When Gabe Kapler is well he's going to play right field.
Lamb is going to play third base, with \RTom\S Evans getting some
playing time. Doug Davis we've identified as the No. 1 guy in our
minor-league system.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan has the blessing of general manager Doug Melvin.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Rangers entered last night's game at Anaheim in
last place in the West with a 15-18 record, three games behind the
division-leading Seattle Mariners, and even though they have been
hit hard by injuries, Melvin wants to see if the young players can
do the job rather than try to improve or plug holes with trades,
</P>
<P>
   It's a change in philosophy from the past few years, when young
players and prospects such as Ryan Dempster and Fernando Tatis were
traded for veterans like John Burkett, Todd Stottlemyre and Todd
Zeile, and high-priced free agents such as John Wetteland and
Rafael Palmeiro were signed, all with the goal of winning now.
</P>
<P>
   The results were the three division titles, but also a
burgeoning payroll and three first-round playoff exits.
</P>
<P>
   With the blessing of owner Tom Hicks, Melvin and Oates went with
a new philosophy this season and despite the early setbacks are
determined to stick with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be successful year in and year out getting everybody
retail,'' Oates said. ``You can't afford everybody retail. What
we're trying to do is get some players wholesale for a couple of
years. We got Ruben Mateo wholesale, until he becomes eligible for
arbitration. We got Mike Lamb and Doug Davis, some pretty good
players, wholesale.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers paid retail for free-agent pitchers Kenny Rogers and
Darren Oliver, indicating the desire to win still exists. But they
also traded two-time MVP Juan Gonzalez to the Detroit Tigers last
November in a nine-player deal that landed Kapler and Cordero, as
well as 25-year-old second baseman Frank Catalanotto, 27-year-old
starting pitcher Justin Thompson and minor-league pitcher Alan
Webb.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't trade a player we were going to have for one year
for five players that we're going to have for one year,'' Melvin
said. ``We traded for players that we're going to have for a few
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates not only is playing the youngsters, at times he's
emphasizing future development over immediate success.
</P>
<P>
   Davis had a shaky first start, but remains in the rotation
rather than being banished to the bullpen. Lamb, a left-handed
batter, hit against Mariners lefty reliever Arthur Rhodes in the
eighth inning with the score tied on Wednesday, even though three
right-handed hitters were on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a reason; there's a plan,'' Oates said. ``Why do we
let Lamb hit against left-handers? There's a plan there. We're not
talking about a year; we're talking about a career. He's our future
third baseman. Why is Doug Davis in the starting rotation? This is
his career. This is the year we're trying to look ahead.''

AFTER RECENT NEAR MISSES, PEGASUS A TRIPLE CROWN THREAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A Triple Crown winner is already being
talked about _ in some minds already awarded _ and we're still more
than a week away from the Preakness. But there appears to be reason
to pardon the giddiness.
</P>
<P>
   The Triple Crown is on the tips of tongues because it has almost
been awarded three consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're as close as you're going to get to a Triple
Crown winner at this point,'' trainer Jenine Sahadi said. ``There
are other horses that I didn't think were Triple Crown horses that
got close.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be Silver Charm, the 1997 Derby and Preakness winner
who was considered a lazy horse who only ran when challenged. And
Real Quiet, the 1998 Derby and Preakness winner who had a litany of
shortcomings _ a skinny build that earned him an unflattering
nickname (The Fish), surgery to straighten his crooked legs when he
was a year old, and a racing record with blemishes (the horse
couldn't win two races in New Mexico). Speaking of a blemished
racing record, Charismatic was a claimer before he won the Kentucky
Derby last year.
</P>
<P>
   Those horses didn't fit the picture of a Triple Crown winner,
but Fusaichi Pegasus offers none of that.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, let no one tell you he's a ``freak.'' Some people
in horse racing like to refer to animals who race as easily as
Fusaichi Pegasus as ``freaks.'' No-pedigree, $17,500-yearling
purchase Seattle Slew was a ``freak.''
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus has a bountiful pedigree. He's out of a dam who
is a full sister to 1992 Preakness Stakes winner Pine Bluff. In
human terms, Pine Bluff is Fusaichi Pegasus' uncle. Like 1982
Belmont winner Conquistador Cielo, his father is the late stallion
Mr. Prospector. This colt brought $4 million as a yearling.
</P>
<P>
   He was bred to run like this, look like this and strike our
imaginations like this. He's no freak.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Silver Charm, Real Quiet and Charismatic, the only way
this colt perplexes us going into the rest of the Triple Crown is
the pronunciation of his name (it's not FOO-see-AH-chee).
</P>
<P>
   You can overcome that. And FOO-sah-EE-chee has overcome so many
things by winning the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   It's mostly history he has overcome. He's the first Derby
favorite to win in 21 years. He's the first horse that was winless
at age 2 to win the Derby in 33 years. He's the first horse that
won the Derby while wearing protective front wraps on his ankles in
41 years.
</P>
<P>
   But it's one thing to overcome history. It appears Fusaichi
Pegasus overcame himself to win this year's Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Most everyone saw, or heard about, Fusaichi Pegasus bucking
during his morning exercise. Most everyone knows it got so bad that
he reared, tossed his rider and landed on his back one morning.
</P>
<P>
   The colt matured, and he did it in a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he came around a lot,'' trainer D. Wayne Lukas said,
observing the horse he'll try to beat in the Preakness with High
Yield. ``I was impressed with him. Obviously, all the fears we had
about \Rproblems\S in the post parade have been put to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   The only time he showed emotion during the pre-race activities
came when trainer Neil Drysdale's efforts to place a fly net over
him in the walkover to the paddock were answered by two heels
flying through the air. The colt bucked; otherwise, he kept the
composure he showed during the paddock schooling session Drysdale
sent him through two days before the Derby. It was marvelous _ the
colt didn't turn a hair.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the track, some wonder if Fusaichi Pegasus turned in a
fast final quarter-mile of the race. He did _ with little prompting
from jockey Kent Desormeaux _ but it wouldn't have been the fastest
of the '90s. It's estimated that Fusaichi Pegasus covered the final
quarter in 25 seconds, quite possibly a few hundredths faster. In
'93, Sea Hero came home in an estimated 24 3/5 seconds, and
Unbridled's estimated clocking in '90 was 24 2/5.
</P>
<P>
   Others: Spectacular Bid in 24 4/5, Affirmed in 25 2/5, Seattle
Slew in 26 1/5 and Secretariat (will they ever catch him?) in 23
1/5.
</P>
<P>
   At Pimlico for the Preakness, Fusaichi Pegasus will face maybe
seven other horses. But don't expect him to be as far back as he
was in the Derby. Drysdale accurately refers to him as ``handy,''
meaning he has ability to be close to the lead under slight urging.
</P>
<P>
   And though he's a big colt, the tight turns at Pimlico shouldn't
be a problem. Big horses tend to get in the way of themselves while
running turns. But Fusaichi Pegasus is the most athletic big horse
one can find. His turn move in the San Felipe prep race at Santa
Anita was particularly astounding.
</P>
<P>
   The Triple Crown hasn't been awarded yet, even if
hard-to-pronounce, easy-running Fusaichi Pegasus makes it easy to
think that way.

SOUTH CAROLINA ACTS ON FLAG, BUT NAACP REMAINS MIFFED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.C., Ga., Miss.)   By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ In the space of a remarkable month, South
Carolina has made three momentous strides in its race relations,
voting to remove one symbol profoundly offensive to black residents
and creating two new ones to honor the achievements of black
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But without exception, those actions have been opposed by the
state chapter of the NAACP, which objected to the method necessary
to achieve them.
</P>
<P>
   It was the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People that first engendered national criticism of the Confederate
battle flag that flies atop the state Capitol, which the General
Assembly has now agreed to remove. But the NAACP's refusal to
accept the compromise has brought criticism from the black and
white moderates who have always been the core of the organization's
national support, and raises questions about the continuing
effectiveness of its economic boycott of South Carolina, which was
originally intended to get the flag off the dome.
</P>
<P>
   Just after 10 p.m. Wednesday, the House joined the Senate in
voting to remove the flag from the dome and the legislative
chambers, a goal that black leaders have sought for decades. But to
remove the flag, lawmakers had to agree to the demands of white
supporters of the flag that a smaller Confederate battle flag fly
on a 30-foot pole in front of the Statehouse, near a monument to
soldiers of the Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, after years of refusal, the state enacted an
official holiday to observe the birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr., becoming the last state to do so. But to get the
votes of reluctant white legislators, the General Assembly at the
same time created a state holiday on Confederate Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday morning, a large group of state leaders broke
ground for a monument celebrating African-American history on a
Capitol greensward strewn with memorials to Confederate heroes, a
few feet from a Statehouse built of granite quarried by slaves. But
no officials of the NAACP were present for the event, and several
black legislators, annoyed by the group's absence, said it was
because a staunch flag supporter, State Senator Glenn F. McConnell,
R-Charleston, had been a leader in getting the monument approved.
</P>
<P>
   The group's leaders later said that was not the reason for their
absence, but they did not explain why they were not there.
</P>
<P>
   Although the flag is now scheduled to come down on July 1 _
assuming the Senate and the House iron out minor differences in
their bills _ James Gallman, president of the state NAACP
conference, said Thursday that the economic sanctions against the
state would continue. The group's executive board will meet soon to
discuss the extent of the sanctions, Gallman said, but he predicted
that some form of boycott would remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some satisfaction that the flag will be coming off the
dome, and, of course, we do take credit for that partial victory
that we have won,'' he said in an interview. ``But there is still a
missing piece, because the flag will still be in a position of
sovereignty on the grounds. It's going to be so prominent that I've
even had some people tell me it would have been better to leave it
up.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's absolutist position _ joined by 23 of 26 black House
members who voted against the flag compromise on Wednesday night _
has exasperated white moderates and many other black officials,
particularly the six black senators who helped broker the
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   With national attention now likely to shift to efforts to remove
Confederate symbols from the state flags of Georgia and
Mississippi, several officials said that the NAACP would eventually
have to lift the boycott, or risk having it be ignored by a public
happy to see the flag removed from the dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should be happy,'' said Sen. Robert Ford, D-Charleston, a
life member of the NAACP. ``They should be counting their blessings
that their boycott helped us achieve this victory. Instead, they're
pouting because they didn't get everything they wanted. It's
childish, and it's not realistic. But after a while, I think
they'll get over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Edgar, director of the Institute for Southern Studies at
the University of South Carolina, who was at the groundbreaking,
suggested that the boycott might begin to lose steam once the flag
came down and it was no longer featured on newscasts showing the
Capitol dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it will still be on a flagpole, but taking it off the
dome is what's significant,'' Edgar said. ``Once the flag is down,
I think the criticism will have less impact.''
</P>
<P>
   That clearly is the hope of Gov. Jim Hodges and the state's
business leaders, who are now hoping to convince tourists and
conventions that have canceled their bookings in the state that it
is now acceptable to return. Opponents of the flag compromise have
known that this moment was coming, of course, but they say the risk
of now being marginalized is less important than the principle of
standing up for what is right.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe in finding the easiest way out of a problem,
the quickest compromise,'' said Lonnie Randolph, president of the
Columbia branch of the NAACP. ``There's always an attempt to do
that when dealing with black-and-white issues, but that's not what
the NAACP is about. We are going to stand on principle, even if
that makes things more difficult.''

<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ Monika Horakova, a sparky psychologist
of 26, is a member of the Czech Republic's Parliament _ the only
one who is a Roma, or Gypsy. But she is still seeking criminal
prosecution against the club in her hometown, Brno, that barred her
because of her race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's happened many times to me,'' she said. ``But the problem
is the process. When you want to get your rights and fight, it's
very difficult. It's hard to prove discrimination, and it's up to
the state prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, in 1998, the club owner simply said the place was full
and, after she complained to the police, a bouncer told them that
she had been ``drunk and arrogant,'' she said, laughing. The police
did not bother to investigate her charges further. Last autumn, she
said, she was told explicitly: ``You can't go in because you're a
Gypsy.''
</P>
<P>
   She paused. ``You know, it's really unbelievable in the 21st
century. But the biggest problem in this country remains racism.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, with the Czech Republic's move toward the European Union,
Horakova decided to sue in a civil court, for violation of her
civil rights. Recently, she said, still delighted, the civil court
agreed with her and awarded her damages from the club owner.
</P>
<P>
   If the money is finally paid, she said, she will give it to
children's homes and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a precedent for the Czech Republic,'' she said. ``I
was _ God! _ I was very happy about it. It gave me a bit of hope
that my children will live in a free country, in a country where
you can get your rights.'' She stopped, quickly answering the
imminent question: ``And I hope it's not just because I'm a member
of Parliament.''
</P>
<P>
   Ondrej Gina, the 49-year-old Gypsy advocate who runs the Roma
Cultural Union from a trailer in his hometown, Rokycany, is not so
sure. He has brought many cases of discrimination against
restaurant and bar owners but never won.
</P>
<P>
   The Czech Republic has a big problem in its treatment of its
200,000 or so Gypsies, he said, and while policies are slowly
improving in the capital, huge problems persist in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born here, but the town doesn't like me,'' he said
wryly. His relations with town hall are so bad that the mayor
refuses to see him.
</P>
<P>
   Gina started his protest activity in 1988, under the Communists,
when he went on hunger strike for eight days. The next year, with
the Velvet Revolution, he started a branch of the pro-democracy
Civic Forum in Rokycany, a town near Pilsen with 13,500 people,
about 800 Gypsies among them _ 90 percent of whom are unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Open discrimination in public places and restaurants is common
here, he said. ``It's illegal, but the town silently tolerates it,
or says it's a problem for the restaurant owners.''
</P>
<P>
   For five years, he has been engaged in a court case against one
local restaurant. Local courts throw out his case. When he appeals,
higher courts send the case back down for another round. His goal,
he says, is to get the state prosecutor to enforce the article in
the criminal code that forbids such discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the precedent,'' he said. Asked about Horakova's case
in civil court, he said: ``In civil court, we bring the case as
individuals. I want the state to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He has even had an American-style sit-in, with the press
invited. ``But nobody would serve us,'' he said. ``The staff just
walked around.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of his problem with the mayor stems from a 1997 meeting on
housing, when city officials would not talk to the Gypsies as a
group, but only as individuals. The Gypsies lay on the floor and
would not leave. The police came and filmed the protest, Gina said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they showed it on television, to show the whole nation
what a mess the Roma can make when they are allowed to meet with
public officials,'' he said. ``Now the mayor says he'll never
negotiate with Gina again.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But Gina has another reason to be proud. His son, Ondrej Gina
Jr., 29, is the first Roma news announcer on the nightly prime
time, Czech state television news.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of going to college, ``I was trained to be a cook and a
waiter, but I never worked in this field,'' he said, smiling. ``It
didn't interest me.''
</P>
<P>
   What has shaped his life is having his father as a model, he
said: ``Everything I have in me I have thanks to him.'' But the
younger Gina also took advantage of communism's fall, working for a
non-governmental foundation and then leaving, in 1992, for Germany,
where he worked for a Gypsy group run by one of the few radical
Gypsy advocates, Rudko Kawczynski.
</P>
<P>
   Gina was a press officer for three years, became interested in
journalism and then was chosen to study at the Council of Europe
and the Central European University in Budapest, funded by George
Soros. Hired by Czech Radio in 1998, Gina did so well that a
television producer asked him to try television, and he quickly
became an anchor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viewers reacted very positively to seeing a Romany on the
screen,'' he said. ``I was pleasantly surprised. Of course, I
received some negative letters as well, but everyone has the right
to an opinion, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Going abroad was better than to a university, he said: ``I
learned to fight for my rights. I learned it was possible to
challenge authority. I try to educate myself all the time. But had
I not had this experience abroad, in another culture, I would not
be what I am now.''
</P>
<P>
   To his proud father, the television job has helped all the
Gypsies. ``Of course it's made a difference, it's made us more
visible,'' Gina said. ``They can see a Romany on television every
day. And I think it surprised a lot of people. The idea still
prevails that Roma can only work with their hands and a shovel.''
And Gypsies themselves started watching the news.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gina has seen the sharp change from communism, when life for
most Gypsies was better here, if only because they had jobs and
income. The goal of the communist state was assimilation, ``to turn
us into working socialist citizens of Gypsy origin,'' he said. That
meant the repression of language, songs and culture, as well as a
controversial birth-control program involving paid sterilization.
</P>
<P>
   But it also meant a certain legal equality, guaranteed jobs,
however poor, and the repression of overt racism. Skinheads and
neo-fascists are post-communist phenomena, Gina said, ``and
unfortunately, we were the first to be targeted.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The government was slow to take these phenomena seriously, he
said, and then worried about the country's image. Political parties
``sensed the negative sentiment toward Roma and were afraid they
would lose voters if they pressed Roma issues, so they played it
both ways, doing enough to have something to say abroad, but not to
do so much as to lose votes.''
</P>
<P>
   But with a recent wave of criticism from the U.S. Congress, the
State Department and the European Union about Roma policies here _
beginning with negative human-rights reports in 1997 _ the Czech
government began to deal more seriously with a worsening situation.
</P>
<P>
   Some Gypsies had been killed by skinheads, unemployment among
Gypsies was skyrocketing, the percentage of Gypsy children put into
special schools for the retarded _ after taking tests tilted toward
Czech language and culture _ had increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could no longer ignore it or talk around it,'' Gina said.
``Now they admit that racism and discrimination are big problems in
the Czech Republic, and they are beginning to do something about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, the Gypsies have learned to organize
themselves and to publicize their grievances, not just here but
abroad. There are more indigenous Czech foundations involved with
helping Gypsies, not just foreign organizations like Soros' Open
Society Institute, which helps Gina's organization.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also too much paternalism, Horakova said, with too
many Czechs who speak no Romany making a living by helping a people
they don't understand, while Gypsies themselves go jobless. ``It's
hard to be polite,'' she said. ``I call it the Roma industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, under pressure, the government is moving to create fairer
tests for children that do not depend so much on Czech-language
skills and culture. Because of a change Horakova initiated in the
law, entrance into secondary school is now by examination, open to
anyone, even those assigned to the special schools.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The younger Gina thinks that life is slowly improving here, that
the new openness must eventually filter down from the capital to
the countryside, where local administrators still rule with open
bias.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still many xenophobes,'' he said. ``But many people
realize there is a problem that needs to be solved. I consider the
Czech Republic my homeland. I couldn't live anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   For Horakova, there is still the sense of a double life, in the
outer world and in the Gypsy one, but she enjoys the tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a great example of integration here, but I didn't know how
to describe it,'' she said. ``Then a friend told me, `You have a
permanent oscillation between Czech and Roma culture.' It's true.
Sometimes in an hour, I can switch between thinking in Romany and
thinking in Czech. It gives me a richer life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud I'm Roma, and we're a part of this nation,'' she
said. ``It's not about chauvinism. But you must never bow your
head.''

CLINTON TO SEND JESSE JACKSON ON MISSION TO SIERRA LEONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also SIERRA-LEONE, U.N.-AFRICA) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Thursday that the United
States would try to help the United Nations reinforce its
peacekeeping troops in Sierra Leone and that he was sending the
Rev. Jesse Jackson to the region to see if he could help negotiate
a halt to the recent violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have asked Reverend Jesse Jackson, my special envoy for
democracy in Africa, to return to the region to work with leaders
there for a peaceful resolution of this crisis,'' Clinton said in a
statement. ``Reverend Jackson has been actively involved in our
diplomatic effort to help the people of Sierra Leone realize their
peaceful aspirations.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. peacekeepers have taken up positions to defend the capital,
Freetown, from rebel attack and apparently made some progress
Thursday, but fighting remains widespread.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton conferred Thursday morning by telephone with Kofi Annan,
the U.N. secretary-general, about American support for military
efforts in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president continued to pledge that we would do whatever we
could to support reinforcement of the mission in Sierra Leone,''
said P.J. Crowley, a White House spokesman on national security
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Crowley said the United States would remain engaged in the
conflict politically, ``and we are willing to help militarily to
help end this conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Clinton said, ``I have instructed our military
to provide needed assistance to accelerate the deployment of
troops'' to the region. Freetown has been girding for an assault by
the Revolutionary United Front.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeeping troops number about 8,000, but they are lightly
armed and did not expect to engage in combat. The troops went to
Sierra Leone to help carry out a peace agreement signed last July
between the government and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate task, administration officials said, is to get
reinforcements to Freetown who are properly equipped. The
peacekeeping operation is essentially in West African hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to support the commitment West African nations have
made to send additional troops to Sierra Leone to restore peace,''
Clinton said. ``A U.S. military team is now in Nigeria to determine
what assistance might be needed from the international community to
outfit and transport these forces as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials said they still knew little or nothing about the
whereabouts and condition of about 500 peacekeepers who were taken
hostage by rebels early last week. The taking of the peacekeepers,
most from Zambia, set off the latest crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he welcomed the statement Tuesday by West African
leaders in Abuja, Nigeria, calling for the release of all hostages
and pledging to protect democratic institutions in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Crowley said the United States would help in getting some
Jordanian troops into Sierra Leone in the next few days. He said
other contingents, including Indians and Bangladeshis, would be
arriving in the region within a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Crowley said the international commitment ``should send a clear
signal to the RUF that this mission is going to be reinforced.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.N. is serious about stabilizing the situation and
bringing additional capabilities into Sierra Leone, to try to get
Sierra Leone back towards the peace process,'' he added.

SPAIN FINDS PROMISING FUEL SOURCE IN RESIDUE FROM OLIVE OIL
PRODUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BENAMEJI, Spain _ Travel this corner of Spain, with its endless
hills of olive groves, and you begin to realize why the country
thinks of itself as a kind of Saudi Arabia of olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just the vast scope of Spain's annual olive oil
production, amounting to roughly one-third of the world's total.
Spanish olives, long processed for cooking, are now being
transmuted into a fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Olive oil production leaves behind a residue of roughly 5.5
million tons of crushed olive pulp and skin. For the last three
years, the farmers around this olive-growing hamlet, population
4,600, have delivered the residue to a specially designed power
station where it is burned to produce electricity and hence reduce
Spain's reliance on the oil that the Saudis produce.
</P>
<P>
   ``The farmers used to dry it and burn it in ovens to heat their
homes,'' said Francisco de la Torre, who manages the olive growers
cooperative of Nuestra Senora de la Gracia, which unites 550 local
growers. In the 1970s, when cheap natural gas arrived from North
Africa, the growers began storing the foul-smelling, blackish
sludge in cesspool-like pits that reeked, attracted insects and
often polluted the groundwater.
</P>
<P>
   The power plant in Benameji, nestled between Cordoba and the
sea, produces 12 megawatts of electricity, roughly enough for four
villages this size. It has been so successful that the leading
Spanish utility, Endesa, which built it together with the Abengoa
engineering group, is about to build two more, each costing $19
million, including one near Jaen, east of Cordoba, whose groves
alone account for more than 20 percent of the world's olive oil
production. Endesa has said there is potential in Spain for about
eight more such plants, each producing 16 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
   That is hardly enough to reduce Spain's electricity needs, but
the project is a small sign of Europe's resolve to develop
renewable sources of electricity like solar power, wind energy and
biomass, that do not deplete natural resources, while helping solve
the problem of industrial waste.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish food processing industry produces biomass that must
be disposed of at considerable cost. De La Torre's cooperative, for
instance, after pressing 2,600 tons of virgin olive oil a year, is
left with almost 10,000 tons of crushed olive skin and pulp.
</P>
<P>
   So last month, Loyola de Palacio, the European Union official
responsible for energy, who is Spanish, announced that the
15-nation union would seek to double the share of electricity
produced with renewable fuels in the next 10 years, to 12 percent
of the total from 5.8 percent. In a country where tilting at
windmills has a certain tradition, the number of giant
power-generating windmills has doubled each year since 1995, to
1,400, and is expected to reach 9,000 by 2010; after selling sun to
tourists for decades, Spain now uses it to produce about 9
megawatts of electricity with solar cells, about half the European
total.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the United States, efforts to use natural fuels like biomass
have been stymied in part by relatively low prices for oil and
natural gas. Biomass now accounts for about 3 percent of national
energy use, but that also includes wood burning to heat homes.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Clinton administration announced in August a
long-term effort to triple the amount of energy produced from crop
wastes and farm products by 2010. The idea, administration
officials said, is to reduce reliance on imported oil, create
additional farm income and generate technologies that American
companies can sell abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Carmen Becerril, director of the Institute for Energy
Diversification and Saving in Madrid, which is financed by the
Ministry of Industry, said ``the whole secret is price.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 Spain, lacking domestic oil and gas resources, joined
several other European countries, including Germany and Denmark, in
providing state funds to offset the difference for consumers
between the cost of providing electricity from renewable sources
and the market price. Given the relatively low cost of the required
technology, she said, government price supports for power generated
from agricultural wastes like olive skins are a fraction of those
for electricity generated by solar power or wind energy.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Luis Marin, who is responsible for diversification at
Endesa, said the power generated at Benameji is fed into the
national grid. Given its relatively small share of the company's
total electricity production, he said, only about 2 percent of what
consumers spend for power is covered by the government subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   But even with government help, the path to alternative energies
can be a slippery one. Raimon Argemi Puigdomenech, Endesa's
technical director, who helped design the Benameji plant, said the
high humidity content of the olive waste _ about 50 percent _
hindered combustion and was overcome only by adding special sand to
the mix. Moreover, hauling the olive mass from distant oil-pressing
sites proved difficult and expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, Endesa's future plants will be constructed near plants
that process olive oil. The residue from such plants contains about
8 percent moisture and so burns more easily. ``The ash is very
clean; there is no sulfur, so it is nontoxic,'' Argemi said. In the
next generation of plants, he added, ``we don't expect any burning
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Endesa sees potential export markets for its technology in other
olive growing countries, including Italy, Greece and Turkey.
Indeed, on the Greek island of Crete, local utilities are already
using olive pressing waste to generate small amounts of
electricity, providing extra income to farmers. In Cuba, Endesa is
helping supply similar technology to produce power from sugar cane
waste.
</P>
<P>
   And after that? Besides olive oil, wine is among Spain's
best-known agricultural products. ``Within two years,'' Argemi
said, ``we will decide whether to build a generating plant using
the waste of wine-making.''

 &HT;    Methodists vote against homosexuality
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ In a tumultuous meeting marked by demonstrations,
arrests and a near-tumble from a balcony, the United Methodist
General Conference voted Thursday to reaffirm its stand against
homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 1,000 delegates voted 2-1 to retain language in the
church's Book of Discipline that ``homosexual practice is
incompatible with Christian teaching.'' By a similar ratio, they
voted to maintain prohibitions against the ordination of gays and
lesbians and the blessing of same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   During the votes, protesters stood silently on the floor in
keeping with their agreement not to disrupt the conference.
</P>
<P>
   But afterward, they moved onto the dais behind presiding Bishop
Daniel Solomon of Baton Rouge, La. and began singing the civil
rights anthem, ``We Shall Overcome.'' Among the demonstrators were
Bishop Susan Morrison of Albany, N.Y., Bishop Joseph Sprague of
Chicago and the Rev. Gregory Dell of Chicago. Dell has been
suspended from the ministry for blessing a same-sex union.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have decided as a group to nonviolently break the covenant
we have made with Bishop Solomon because we believe the church has
broken covenant with us,'' said Randy Miller, a spokesman for a
coalition of United Methodist organizations that support gay
rights.
</P>
<P>
   At that, Solomon put his head in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm burying my head in prayer,'' he said. ``I cannot witness
what is about to occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Police removed the demonstrators and charged them with
disrupting a lawful meeting, an offense that carries a maximum fine
of $250 or 30 days in jail, according to police spokeswoman Lt.
Sharon MacKay.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the meeting room, Joe Whittemore, the layman who heads
the North Georgia delegation and a veteran of two previous
quadrennial General Conferences, had tears in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made it clear and unequivocable that the homosexual
community is welcome in the United Methodist Church,'' he said.
``But that does not mean that we can change our doctrine and our
historical position about homosexual practice being incompatible
with Christian teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is taking any joy in this,'' said Tom Jackson from
Athens, who supported the bans on gay ordination and same-sex
unions. ``At some point, though, the church has to clearly express
its stand. It's sad any time there is a deep division in the body
of Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the debate, after losing the first key vote,
demonstrators made their way onto the floor while others lined the
balcony. A delegate identified later as Jeanne Smile climbed to the
rail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am gay,'' she screamed, sobbing. ``I have been gay all my
life. I have tried to be what God wants me to be.''
</P>
<P>
   She teetered above the conference floor over the tables where
the North Georgia delegation sat. Whittemore and others scurried to
catch her in case she fell. But uniformed security officers grasped
the woman, put her into a wheel chair, fitted her with an oxygen
mask and took her away to be examined by paramedics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was horrifying,'' said Kathryn Johnson, executive director
of the Methodist Federation for Social Action, whose 2,000 members
are part of a coalition supporting gay rights. ``I felt for her. I
think it captures her pain.''
</P>
<P>
   The clash over homosexuality resembled previous debates that
have taken place in United Methodist and other mainline Protestant
denominations for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those of us who believe that homosexuality is incompatible
with Christian teaching, this is not an issue on which we can
compromise,'' said the Rev. Roger Elliot of North Carolina. ``It's
doesn't mean we are bigoted or homophobic or mean-spirited.''
</P>
<P>
   Edna Brubaker of Michigan, who said some members of her family
are gay, voiced a different view: ``God is a God who has spread the
table wide, and all have a place at that table.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Miller, a delegate from New Jersey, identified himself as a
gay man born into a family of Methodist ministers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be a handful of gay and lesbian delegates in here,''
he said, ``but the rest of you are heterosexual people making
decisions about us. ... I encourage you to remember that this is my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Creech of Raleigh, N.C., a former United Methodist
minister who lost his credentials for performing same-sex unions in
violation of church policy, said the day's work on the convention
floor was ``an extremely painful defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he said, ``it's a defeat for the moment, not for the
long term.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eric Lindros, the Philadelphia Flyers' star center, has missed
the first two rounds of the Stanley Cup playoffs and will not be on
the ice Sunday when his team faces the New Jersey Devils in the
first game of the National Hockey League's Eastern Conference
finals.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros, in fact, may not return again this season because of a
severe concussion two months ago, and his athletic future is in
doubt. His ordeal began in March, when for nine days after an
opponent elbowed him in the head, team trainers and doctors gave
Lindros ibuprofen and head massages _ even though he had suffered
three previous concussions and says he complained daily of
headaches, nausea and, eventually, memory loss.
</P>
<P>
   He played in four games before he was finally sent to a Chicago
neurologist, who said he had sustained a severe concussion. Lindros
said he had longed for the team to take him off the ice, but could
not bring himself to ask. There is an unwritten code of stoicism
among hockey players, as there is in football, boxing and other
contact sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to explain my symptoms and that things were not real
good, but I was not going to pull myself out of the game,'' Lindros
told reporters. ``I was hoping the team would take me out, knowing
what went on and expressing to them for days about my headaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, athletes like Lindros shrugged off
concussions as a minor injury. Football players derisively called
them ``dings'' or ``getting your bell rung.'' Only in recent years
have scientists begun to understand what happens to the brain when
it is severely shaken: how one concussion, if not given time to
heal, can make an athlete more vulnerable to others, and how
multiple concussions can lead to permanent brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year alone, elite football quarterbacks like Steve
Young and Troy Aikman have been laid out unconscious on the field,
and hockey players like Lindros have been dazed after collisions on
the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Concussions remain one of the most dangerous and perplexing
injuries in sports, an invisible and unpredictable wound that has
curtailed the careers of some of North America's greatest sports
heroes, from Roger Staubach of the Dallas Cowboys to Pat LaFontaine
of the New York Rangers. &UR;  &LR; Brett Lindros, Eric's brother, also
retired after suffering several concussions while playing for the
New York Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   And even though awareness about the danger of multiple
concussions has grown, athletes, agents, trainers and coaches on
all levels of sports are still struggling with how to cope with the
injury.
</P>
<P>
   While researchers have not been able to answer definitively how
long it takes the human brain to heal, the American Academy of
Neurology has devised broad guidelines on when it is safe for an
athlete to return to play. But trainers and team physicians,
especially at the professional level, disagree about what
guidelines, if any, should be followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply don't have a standardized diagnostic technique and
that means it's sort of done on a hit-and-miss basis,'' said Leigh
Steinberg, an agent who represents 140 professional athletes,
including 22 pro quarterbacks. ``We need to have some consensus on
when it's acceptable to have a player put back into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the National Football League nor the National Hockey
League has endorsed guidelines on returning to play after a
concussion; both leagues leave such decisions up to team trainers
and doctors. There are about 160 concussions in the NFL and 70 in
the NHL each year, league officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, all NHL teams and about two-thirds of NFL teams have
tested players' cognitive skills at the beginning of a season so
trainers have a baseline against which to measure a player after a
concussion. The NHL encourages teams to keep players off the ice
until they regain the mental skills they had before injury.
</P>
<P>
   But in practice these decisions are still made on a case by case
basis, usually by trainers and team doctors who are not
neurologists, according to players and union and league officials.
Sometimes mistakes are made.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a fool-proof program yet,'' said Tim Wharnsby, a
spokesman for the NHL Players Association.
</P>
<P>
   One major problem is that athletes face enormous pressure to
continue playing, not only from peers, who sometimes ridicule them
for being weak, but also from coaches and owners, who at times
place the team's immediate needs above the athlete's long-term
health, many players said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have guidelines,'' said Merril Hoge, a football
analyst for ESPN and a former Chicago Bears running back who had to
retire after two concussions in 1994. ``There is an enormous amount
of pressure on the player, the owner and the doctor to get that
player back out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindros Diagnosis Slow in Coming  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lindros faced precisely that pressure, people close to him said.
After being hit in the second period of a game against the Boston
Bruins on March 4, his vision faded to yellow and he sat out a
shift on the ice. Between the second and third periods, he vomited
in the dressing room. Both symptoms were clear signs of concussion,
doctors say. He also told trainers that he had a headache and was
given heat packs as a remedy.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next nine days, he complained daily to the the team's
trainer, John Worley, of severe headaches, Lindros' lawyer and
others close to him said. He was treated with over-the-counter
analgesics and massages before games.
</P>
<P>
   Eight days after the injury, the team finally sent him to a
dentist, out of concern that his jaw might have been injured. The
following day, he played a game in Denver. He said later he could
not remember what he was supposed to do on his shifts.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the training staff, in consultation with a team
doctor, decided Lindros was suffering from migraines and put him on
the disabled list. They sent him to a Philadelphia neurologist, Dr.
Stephen Silberstein, who specializes in headaches. Silberstein said
the root of Lindros' symptoms had been a concussion and, after
treating him for the migraines, sent him to Chicago to see Dr.
James Kelly.

 &HT;    Methodists vote against homosexuality
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ In a tumultuous meeting marked by demonstrations,
arrests and a near-tumble from a balcony, the United Methodist
General Conference voted Thursday to reaffirm its stand against
homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 1,000 delegates voted 2-1 to retain language in the
church's Book of Discipline that ``homosexual practice is
incompatible with Christian teaching.'' By a similar ratio, they
voted to maintain prohibitions against the ordination of gays and
lesbians and the blessing of same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   During the votes, protesters stood silently on the floor in
keeping with their agreement not to disrupt the conference.
</P>
<P>
   But afterward, they moved onto the dais behind presiding Bishop
Daniel Solomon of Baton Rouge, La. and began singing the civil
rights anthem, ``We Shall Overcome.'' Among the demonstrators were
Bishop Susan Morrison of Albany, N.Y., Bishop Joseph Sprague of
Chicago and the Rev. Gregory Dell of Chicago. Dell has been
suspended from the ministry for blessing a same-sex union.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have decided as a group to nonviolently break the covenant
we have made with Bishop Solomon because we believe the church has
broken covenant with us,'' said Randy Miller, a spokesman for a
coalition of United Methodist organizations that support gay
rights.
</P>
<P>
   At that, Solomon put his head in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm burying my head in prayer,'' he said. ``I cannot witness
what is about to occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Police removed the demonstrators and charged them with
disrupting a lawful meeting, an offense that carries a maximum fine
of $250 or 30 days in jail, according to police spokeswoman Lt.
Sharon MacKay.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the meeting room, Joe Whittemore, the layman who heads
the North Georgia delegation and a veteran of two previous
quadrennial General Conferences, had tears in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made it clear and unequivocable that the homosexual
community is welcome in the United Methodist Church,'' he said.
``But that does not mean that we can change our doctrine and our
historical position about homosexual practice being incompatible
with Christian teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is taking any joy in this,'' said Tom Jackson from
Athens, who supported the bans on gay ordination and same-sex
unions. ``At some point, though, the church has to clearly express
its stand. It's sad any time there is a deep division in the body
of Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the debate, after losing the first key vote,
demonstrators made their way onto the floor while others lined the
balcony. A delegate identified later as Jeanne Smile climbed to the
rail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am gay,'' she screamed, sobbing. ``I have been gay all my
life. I have tried to be what God wants me to be.''
</P>
<P>
   She teetered above the conference floor over the tables where
the North Georgia delegation sat. Whittemore and others scurried to
catch her in case she fell. But uniformed security officers grasped
the woman, put her into a wheel chair, fitted her with an oxygen
mask and took her away to be examined by paramedics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was horrifying,'' said Kathryn Johnson, executive director
of the Methodist Federation for Social Action, whose 2,000 members
are part of a coalition supporting gay rights. ``I felt for her. I
think it captures her pain.''
</P>
<P>
   The clash over homosexuality resembled previous debates that
have taken place in United Methodist and other mainline Protestant
denominations for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those of us who believe that homosexuality is incompatible
with Christian teaching, this is not an issue on which we can
compromise,'' said the Rev. Roger Elliot of North Carolina. ``It's
doesn't mean we are bigoted or homophobic or mean-spirited.''
</P>
<P>
   Edna Brubaker of Michigan, who said some members of her family
are gay, voiced a different view: ``God is a God who has spread the
table wide, and all have a place at that table.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Miller, a delegate from New Jersey, identified himself as a
gay man born into a family of Methodist ministers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be a handful of gay and lesbian delegates in here,''
he said, ``but the rest of you are heterosexual people making
decisions about us. ... I encourage you to remember that this is my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Creech of Raleigh, N.C., a former United Methodist
minister who lost his credentials for performing same-sex unions in
violation of church policy, said the day's work on the convention
floor was ``an extremely painful defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he said, ``it's a defeat for the moment, not for the
long term.''

 UNDATED: James Kelly.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kelly is one of a handful of neurologists who have studied
sports concussions and who spearheaded efforts by the American
Academy of Neurology in 1997 to come up with a consensus on
guidelines for returning to play. The guidelines were intended to
help coaches and doctors avoid catastrophic head injuries to
players.
</P>
<P>
   After two days of examinations, Kelly said Lindros' concussion
had been more severe than Silberstein thought. Given the player's
history of past concussions, Kelly prescribed a long rest until his
symptoms disappeared completely.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros, who declined to be interviewed for this article, is
still trying to fight his way back. But he has clearly become more
vulnerable to brain injuries. On May 5, in his first scrimmage
during rehabilitation, Lindros suffered yet another concussion _
his third this year _ when he collided with a defenseman. Lindros
was hit in his jaw and mouth, and again suffered headaches and
other symptoms. He will be sidelined for at least another two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said Lindros had risked a more serious injury by
continuing to skate for four games after the concussion in early
March. ``His symptoms worsened because of returning too early,''
Kelly said.

   Zack Hill, a spokesman for the Flyers, declined repeated
requests for interviews with the team's doctors, trainers or other
team officials.
</P>
<P>
   But Worley, the Flyers' trainer, defended his decisions in
comments to the Philadelphia Daily News; he said Lindros had
complained of nothing worse than headaches and had told trainers he
was feeling better throughout the week after the injury. ``I feel
confident in the decisions that were made with the information we
were all presented with,'' Worley said.

   `Sort of Like A Small Seizure'  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Concussions in contact sports have been around since the first
pugilists and wrestlers began competing thousands of years ago.
More than 300,000 people sustain them in sporting events in the
United States each year, federal epidemiologists say. But it is
only in the last 15 years that neurologists have begun to
understand what happens when the brain is severely shaken.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to popular belief, a concussion is not a bruise to the
brain caused by hitting a hard surface. Indeed, no physical
swelling or bleeding is usually seen on radiological scans. The
injury generally occurs when the head either accelerates rapidly
and then is stopped, or is spun rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   This violent shaking causes the brain cells to become
depolarized and fire all their neurotransmitters at once in an
unhealthy cascade, flooding the brain with chemicals and deadening
certain receptors linked to learning and memory. The results often
include confusion, blurred vision, memory loss, nausea and,
sometimes, unconsciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sort of like a small seizure,'' said Dr. David A. Hovda,
the director of the Brain Injury Research Center at the University
of California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Hovda's research with rats suggests that it takes tremendous
energy for the brain to correct the chemical imbalance. The
chemical changes associated with even a minor concussion in rats
last at least 10 days, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hovda and other researchers say changes to the human brain start
to resolve themselves immediately, but the recovery time seems to
vary. It depends not only on the severity of the blow, they say,
but also on how many previous concussions a person has suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Neurologists say that once a person suffers a concussion, he is
as much as four times more likely to sustain a second one.
Moreover, after several concussions, it takes less of a blow to
cause the injury and requires more time to recover.
</P>
<P>
   In some instances, athletes suffer a second concussion before
their brain has recovered from the first. In rare cases, the second
injury can lead to what doctors call second impact syndrome, in
which massive swelling of the brain causes pressure inside the
skull that chokes off the flow of fresh blood and leads to death or
irreparable brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   It was concern over second impact syndrome among adolescents
that led Kelly and several other prominent neurologists to push the
American Academy of Neurology to establish guidelines for returning
to play.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines divide concussions into three grades of severity,
with a prolonged knockout being the worst. In essence, the academy
recommends that athletes whose symptoms _ headaches, nausea,
amnesia, blurred vision _ do not clear up within fifteen minutes,
or who lose consciousness even briefly, be kept out of competition
until their symptoms have disappeared completely for at least a
week.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors on an NFL committee that is studying concussions, as
well as many team doctors and trainers, have criticized these
guidelines, saying they are not supported by research. ``We don't
know whether being knocked out briefly is any more dangerous than
having amnesia and not being knocked out,'' said Mark R. Lovell, a
neurologist at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit who is a
consultant for both the NFL and the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see people all the time that get knocked out briefly and
have no symptoms,'' he added. ``Others get elbowed, go back to the
bench and say where am I?''
</P>
<P>
   Lovell says that because each brain is organized differently,
every athlete responds differently to brain injuries. This explains
why some boxers have a glass jaw, while others can take immense
punishment without being knocked out.
</P>
<P>
   Lovell designed the neuropsychological testing programs used by
the NFL and the NHL. He advocates that team doctors evaluate
players before the season and then after each concussion, looking
for slight changes in memory and information processing speed.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the NFL committee is Dr. Elliott Pellman, an
internist who is team doctor for the Jets and the Islanders.
Pellman also contends that so little is known about concussions
that one-size-fits-all guidelines make no sense. He says team
doctors should be allowed to use ``the art of medicine'' to
determine when a player is ready to return after a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really have to hope that the doctors that deal with this
have a lot of experience with it, use the tools available and are
not affected by the outside din,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pellman said his committee had overseen a study to discover what
sort of football collisions cause concussions, using computerized
analysis of game footage and crash-test dummies to recreate
collisions. The study's preliminary findings suggest that most
football concussions happen during head-to-head collisions and that
blows to the ear are especially likely to produce concussions,
Pellman said. He said the hope is to eventually pressure equipment
manufacturers to devise safer helmets.

COLORADO PRODUCING AN AVALANCHE OF WHINING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ What's that you're saying? Try to speak up,
OK? It's hard to hear anything at the moment. A loud, annoying
whine keeps coming in full-blast from Denver. So unpleasant. So
unmanly. Yet ...
</P>
<P>
   Here it is, still some 36 hours from initial puck-droppage in
the Western Conference finals, but the Avalanche has already earned
for itself the second annual ``Lindy-Ruff-Cry-Me-a-River'' Award.
</P>
<P>
   Presentation ceremonies will be held in Buffalo as soon as Lindy
can be talked down from the nearest ledge. Meanwhile, tears to you,
Bob Hartley. And take another bite of sour grape, Mr. Patrick Roy.
Boy, Roy, have you ever gone sensitive on us.
</P>
<P>
   In what would appear to be very welcome ear-music to the Stars,
Colorado's coach Hartley filed a restraining order this week with
the NHL high court against one Richard Matvichuk. The charge is
that brutal behavior by our man Matty occurred in the same
conference finals matchup last May.
</P>
<P>
   Let's review the X-rays. A Matvichuk check on forward Milan
Hejduk resulted in a broken collarbone. A Matvichuk check on
forward Peter Forsberg resulted in a separated shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Hejduk said his injury came on a clean blow. Forsberg also had
nary a whine, proving once again why the Angry Swede is the best
player in the game today. Forsberg is a rare trifecta talent _
skill, toughness and meanness. Matvichuk got him only because
Forsberg didn't get Matvichuk first.
</P>
<P>
   Hit happens. And that goes double in the kind of classic series
the Avalanche and Stars gave us a year ago. But along comes Hartley
this week, squealing like an overgrown Eddie Haskell that the
referees need to collar Matvichuk. This from the same coach who had
the despicable Claude Lemieux skating on his team last season.
</P>
<P>
   It's funny that Hartley would be singling out Matvichuk and
making him a focal point before the series even starts. To each his
own, but Ken Hitchcock goes the opposite direction in these
situations. The mere mention of Bryan Marchment creates an
emotional firestorm around here, except it's all based on media and
fan reaction. In the San Jose series, Hitchcock low-keyed the
presence of Marchment, as always, due to the theory that if his
players are thinking about Marchment, then Marchment has already
won half the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Hartley is inflicted with Matvichuk phobia. Does his
team make that same mistake?
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of phobia, Patty Roy has suddenly gotten himself all
geeked-up over something said by Eddie Belfour. That's funny, too,
since Belfour is a man of such few words. In the three years he's
been in town, Eddie's most memorable statement has been, ``I need a
lawyer.'' Unless it was, ``my bail is how much?''
</P>
<P>
   Where words are concerned, Belfour knows when to say when. I've
got a billion dollars of my own that says Eddie has never been
involved in a verbal conflict pertaining to hockey. Every other
kind of conflict, yes. But Belfour doesn't say enough to merit a
scratch-your-eyes-out confrontation. Unless, however, it's the Roy
ego involved.
</P>
<P>
   On a national telephone hookup with hockey writers months ago,
Eddie answered this long, rambling question by saying he considered
himself as good a goalie as Patrick, if not better. I hate to
deflate Roy, but the quote never even made print locally. It was
not considered newsworthy.
</P>
<P>
   But Roy was so insulted he actually spent an ample amount of
time in the middle of the Detroit series answering Belfour's
comment, then said he wasn't. ``I don't feel like I have to answer
because he put all the pressure on himself,'' Roy said. ``He's the
one who's got to outplay me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Patty boy, get yourself a memory. He already has outplayed
you.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Game 6 last May? Then Game 7? The Stars faced
elimination in both, except the Stars won both by the same 4-1
score. Belfour looked like a billion dollars under that kind of
pressure. Roy looked like he should have been working the front
desk at the Mansion Hotel. ``I've got a room with a view for you,
Mr. Keane. And you too, Mr. Langenbrunner.''
</P>
<P>
   Somebody better break this to Roy, but do it gently. He's so
tender, you know. The pressure is squarely on you, Patrick. If your
butt is bested again by Belfour, that will end the current
comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the early returns, however, do expect an endless amount
of whining over the next several weeks. The Avs have spoken. Lindy
Ruff would be proud.

 UNDATED: safer helmets.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other research has suggested even soccer players are prone to
head injuries. A recent Dutch study that compared 53 professional
soccer players to 27 elite runners and swimmers showed the soccer
players had impaired cognitive skills compared to the other
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Among professional football and hockey teams, Pellman said, the
awareness of the problem has grown. ``I think everyone is
profoundly careful now, maybe even too cautious, because nobody
wants to make a mistake,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kelly, who is also a consultant for the Bears, says the
pre-season neuropsychological testing is not being done uniformly
across the NFL and that some teams have refused to participate. Nor
are all trainers as diligent about checking for concussions as they
should be, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some football trainers send people who are unconscious back
into a game,'' he said. ``What is it going to take to get these
guys on board?''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks Are Highly Vulnerable  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no position is sports is associated with concussions
more than quarterback. Two of the NFL's premier quarterbacks, Steve
Young of the San Francisco 49ers and Troy Aikman of the Dallas
Cowboys, were forced out by concussions last season.
</P>
<P>
   Young, 37, was sidelined for most of the season after sustaining
a concession in late September, his fourth in three years. He is
still pondering whether to continue playing, people close to him
said. Aikman sat out two games last November after he suffered
concussions in two consecutive weeks. He has had six in his
professional career, but never previously missed a game because of
a concussion and says he does not intend to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Young nor Aikman was willing to be interviewed about
their injuries. Their silence is a measure of both the macho
culture of football and, people close to the quarterbacks say, the
fear that talking publicly about their concussions makes them even
more vulnerable to defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes them a target on the field,'' said Steinberg, the
agent who represents Aikman and Young.
</P>
<P>
   But other football players whose careers have already been ended
said that for many years the injury had not been considered very
important. Some said the guidelines Kelly and others have proposed
would have helped extend their playing days.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Al Toon, once a mercurial wide receiver for the New York Jets,
said it was not uncommon for him to play the week following a
concussion. He retired in November 1992, after neurologists
informed him that his cognitive skills were deteriorating. He said
at the time that he had endured as many as 10 concussions. Not only
was it taking longer and longer to recover after each one, but the
threat of permanent damage loomed large in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically I played the next week,'' he said. ``It didn't feel
like I was doing something detrimental in the long term. But it
took less and less of a blow to create the same amount of impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Toon, who now owns real estate and a bank in Madison, Wis., said
that for four years after he retired he had trouble remembering
information and focusing on events around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a dark and gloomy low point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A study presented last week at the American Academy of
Neurology's annual meeting suggested that many retired football
players endure similar symptoms. Researchers surveyed 1,090 former
NFL players and found more than 60 percent had suffered at least
one concussion in their careers and 26 percent had had three or
more. Those who had had concussions reported more problems with
memory, concentration, speech impediments, headaches and other
neurological problems than those who had not, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   Some former players remain bitter about their treatment. Hoge
said team doctors in Chicago allowed him to play the following week
after he suffered a severe concussion in a preseason game against
Kansas City in August 1994. The Bears never gave him a
neuropsychological examination, he said, and the team doctor
approved his return to play after a telephone conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been treated as no big deal,'' Hoge said. ``At the
very least you need an expert evaluation.''
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks later, he was hammered on a tackle in a game against
Buffalo and collapsed on the next down. His vital signs vanished
for a few seconds. He spent two days in an intensive care unit, and
was told by neurologists that his eight-year career was over.
</P>
<P>
   For a year, Hoge said, he could not stand bright lights and had
dizzy spells. He struggled with arithmetic and reading was
difficult. He also had no sense of direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the most helpless feelings I ever dealt with,'' he
said. ``I would get lost in my own neighborhood.''

   Seven Concussions And Retirement  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pat LaFontaine, the former star of the New York Islanders, New
York Rangers and Buffalo Sabres, knows precisely what Lindros is
going through. In October 1996, he suffered a concussion when a
defenseman knocked him off his feet. He slammed his forehead into
the ice and lost consciousness for several seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't remember anything until sitting in the training
room looking up at the TV and it was the last period,'' he recalled
in a recent interview. ``My memory recall was blocked out for 45
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the sixth concussion of his career. The team doctor let
LaFontaine back on the ice the following week, but he could barely
play. LaFontaine said he could not sleep and suffered migraines. He
found he could not keep up with the play on the ice. After he
soldiered through six games, he went into a team executive's office
and, in his words, ``broke down.''
</P>
<P>
   Neurologists determined he was suffering from the effects of
multiple concussions. ``I shouldn't have been doing anything for at
least three weeks,'' LaFontaine said. ``Every doctor said just be
thankful you didn't get hit during those three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   It took LaFontaine six months to recover. For weeks he would not
leave the house or shower. When the symptoms vanished, he said, it
was as if someone plugged in a telephone line again.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, he tried to make a comeback, signing with
the Rangers. He played 67 games, but then collided with a teammate
and received another concussion. It took several months to recover,
so in the summer of 1998, he decided to hang up his skates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is the minute a concussion occurs it has to be
dealt with,'' he said. ``The symptoms have to be cleared for at
least a week.''

AFTER RECENT NEAR MISSES, PEGASUS A TRIPLE CROWN THREAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A Triple Crown winner is already being
talked about _ in some minds already awarded _ and we're still more
than a week away from the Preakness. But there appears to be reason
to pardon the giddiness.
</P>
<P>
   The Triple Crown is on the tips of tongues because it has almost
been awarded three consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're as close as you're going to get to a Triple
Crown winner at this point,'' trainer Jenine Sahadi said. ``There
are other horses that I didn't think were Triple Crown horses that
got close.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be Silver Charm, the 1997 Derby and Preakness winner
who was considered a lazy horse who only ran when challenged. And
Real Quiet, the 1998 Derby and Preakness winner who had a litany of
shortcomings _ a skinny build that earned him an unflattering
nickname (The Fish), surgery to straighten his crooked legs when he
was a year old, and a racing record with blemishes (the horse
couldn't win two races in New Mexico). Speaking of a blemished
racing record, Charismatic was a claimer before he won the Kentucky
Derby last year.
</P>
<P>
   Those horses didn't fit the picture of a Triple Crown winner,
but Fusaichi Pegasus offers none of that.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, let no one tell you he's a ``freak.'' Some people
in horse racing like to refer to animals who race as easily as
Fusaichi Pegasus as ``freaks.'' No-pedigree, $17,500-yearling
purchase Seattle Slew was a ``freak.''
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus has a bountiful pedigree. He's out of a dam who
is a full sister to 1992 Preakness Stakes winner Pine Bluff. In
human terms, Pine Bluff is Fusaichi Pegasus' uncle. Like 1982
Belmont winner Conquistador Cielo, his father is the late stallion
Mr. Prospector. This colt brought $4 million as a yearling.
</P>
<P>
   He was bred to run like this, look like this and strike our
imaginations like this. He's no freak.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Silver Charm, Real Quiet and Charismatic, the only way
this colt perplexes us going into the rest of the Triple Crown is
the pronunciation of his name (it's not FOO-see-AH-chee).
</P>
<P>
   You can overcome that. And FOO-sah-EE-chee has overcome so many
things by winning the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   It's mostly history he has overcome. He's the first Derby
favorite to win in 21 years. He's the first horse that was winless
at age 2 to win the Derby in 33 years. He's the first horse that
won the Derby while wearing protective front wraps on his ankles in
41 years.
</P>
<P>
   But it's one thing to overcome history. It appears Fusaichi
Pegasus overcame himself to win this year's Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Most everyone saw, or heard about, Fusaichi Pegasus bucking
during his morning exercise. Most everyone knows it got so bad that
he reared, tossed his rider and landed on his back one morning.
</P>
<P>
   The colt matured, and he did it in a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he came around a lot,'' trainer D. Wayne Lukas said,
observing the horse he'll try to beat in the Preakness with High
Yield. ``I was impressed with him. Obviously, all the fears we had
about \Rproblems\S in the post parade have been put to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   The only time he showed emotion during the pre-race activities
came when trainer Neil Drysdale's efforts to place a fly net over
him in the walkover to the paddock were answered by two heels
flying through the air. The colt bucked; otherwise, he kept the
composure he showed during the paddock schooling session Drysdale
sent him through two days before the Derby. It was marvelous _ the
colt didn't turn a hair.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the track, some wonder if Fusaichi Pegasus turned in a
fast final quarter-mile of the race. He did _ with little prompting
from jockey Kent Desormeaux _ but it wouldn't have been the fastest
of the '90s. It's estimated that Fusaichi Pegasus covered the final
quarter in 25 seconds, quite possibly a few hundredths faster. In
'93, Sea Hero came home in an estimated 24 3/5 seconds, and
Unbridled's estimated clocking in '90 was 24 2/5.
</P>
<P>
   Others: Spectacular Bid in 24 4/5, Affirmed in 25 2/5, Seattle
Slew in 26 1/5 and Secretariat (will they ever catch him?) in 23
1/5.
</P>
<P>
   At Pimlico for the Preakness, Fusaichi Pegasus will face maybe
seven other horses. But don't expect him to be as far back as he
was in the Derby. Drysdale accurately refers to him as ``handy,''
meaning he has ability to be close to the lead under slight urging.
</P>
<P>
   And though he's a big colt, the tight turns at Pimlico shouldn't
be a problem. Big horses tend to get in the way of themselves while
running turns. But Fusaichi Pegasus is the most athletic big horse
one can find. His turn move in the San Felipe prep race at Santa
Anita was particularly astounding.
</P>
<P>
   The Triple Crown hasn't been awarded yet, even if
hard-to-pronounce, easy-running Fusaichi Pegasus makes it easy to
think that way.

CLINTON CALLS FOR BIG INCREASE OF SKILLED WORKERS ALLOWED INTO
U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Racing to keep up with a booming economy, President
Clinton on Thursday proposed an increase of more than 85 percent in
the number of skilled foreign workers who could be admitted to the
United States to fill job openings in high-technology industries.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton asked Congress to provide 200,000 visas for such workers
in each of the next three years. The existing law, adopted in 1998,
limits the number of such visas to 107,500 in 2001. After that,
under existing law, the ceiling will fall back to 65,000 a year,
the level in effect before congressional action in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The president reluctantly supported the much more modest
increase made in 1998. But since then, technology companies say,
the demand for computer programmers, engineers and other skilled
workers has outstripped the supply and exceeded official
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Congress favor an even bigger increase than the one
Clinton proposed on Thursday. Congress therefore appears likely to
approve a very substantial increase in the number of visas, known
as H-1B visas, for high-tech workers.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Cohen, senior vice president of the Information
Technology Association of America, an industry group, welcomed the
president's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very encouraging that the White House sees the need to
raise the cap,'' Cohen said. ``The administration understands
better now than in 1998 that information technology gives an
incredible push to the overall economy. But the number of visas
proposed by the administration is probably not adequate. We would
be pleased to see the cap eliminated, so the marketplace could
decide how many people are needed to get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Nations in Europe and Asia are competing for the same pool of
high-technology workers. And Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., said
some American companies would ``move their operations overseas,
taking American jobs with them,'' if they could not get the workers
they needed here.
</P>
<P>
   India provides by far the largest number of skilled foreign
workers under the H-1B visa program. Its citizens received 47
percent of such visas issued in the last year. The next largest
share went to China, with 9 percent, and then to Britain, Canada
and the Philippines, with about 3 percent each.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, the president's economic policy adviser, set
forth Clinton's proposal in a letter to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to increase the supply of skilled workers is to
improve the education and training of U.S. citizens and other
people already in the country, Sperling said. ``However,'' he said,
``at times, U.S. businesses need additional access to the
international labor market to maintain and enhance our global
competitiveness, particularly in high-growth new technology
industries and particularly in tight labor markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Sperling said the previous increase in the number of H-1B visas
had proved inadequate because ``our economy has grown beyond
anyone's most optimistic predictions.'' Last month the nation's
unemployment rate fell to 3.9 percent, the lowest level in 30
years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., welcomed the president's proposal
to increase the number of H-1B visas. But Dreier said it was
unfortunate that the White House had ventured into ``extraneous
areas'' by insisting, for example, that Congress also legalize the
status of certain immigrants from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras
and Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the
House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, was skeptical. ``There
is still no objective, credible study that documents a shortage of
American high-tech workers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing Thursday's White House proposal, Smith said, ``I
have never seen a more complete disregard for American workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael W. Gildea, a policy analyst in the professional employee
division of the AFL-CIO, said: ``We would have preferred no
increase in the number of visas. We see no credible evidence of
widespread shortages of information technology workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Sperling said technology companies appeared to have difficulty
finding workers with the necessary skills. But he added, ``The lack
of clear data suggests that it's best to offer a temporary
solution, and to make that solution contingent on an increase in
spending for the education and training American workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposed a sharp increase in the fees charged to
employers who use the foreign worker program. He said the fee for
an H-1B visa, now $500, should be raised to $2,000 for most
employers, with a fee of $3,000 for companies that depend heavily
on skilled foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he would use the fees to help pay for the
training of American workers, especially those who are
underrepresented in the information technology industry _ women,
minorities and people with disabilities.

 &HT;    Judge says court 'embraces' task
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Hello, I'm Larry Edmondson,'' the man wearing the
black suit, shiny silver tie and wide grin told the table of
startled attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers in the crowded 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
courtroom sprang to their feet and shook hands with Judge J.L.
Edmondson, who was about to don his robe and join two colleagues on
the bench to hear arguments in the Elian Gonzalez case.
</P>
<P>
   It is Edmondson's custom to address the courtroom from the bench
at the start of a day's arguments. But it is almost unheard of for
him to walk into court and speak to the audience.
</P>
<P>
   He welcomed the spectators, explained his court's procedures and
asked everyone in the gallery to remain quiet during the arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, we don't get many visitors here,'' Edmondson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of you may have strong views (about Elian's case),'' he
added. ``You have a right to those views....But in no way signal to
us what those views are.''
</P>
<P>
   Oral arguments, the judge said, are used by lawyers to clarify,
sharpen and underline their positions and to give judges an
opportunity to ask questions on issues that concern them.
</P>
<P>
   Edmondson, 52, is a former school board lawyer who was appointed
to the 11th Circuit Court in 1986 by President Reagan. He told the
gallery that the judges hearing the contentious case do not shy
away from their duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not fear that burden,'' he said. ``We embrace it. It is
the business of the U.S. Courts of Appeals to decide hard cases. We
believe we know how to do that.''

SENATE APPROVES AFRICA-CARIBBEAN TRADE BILL
</HEADLINE>
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate decisively approved legislation on
Thursday to promote commerce with Africa and the Caribbean, ending
more than five years of defeats on trade bills for the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The 77-19 vote reflected unusual bipartisan support for a
compromise worked out by Senate and House negotiators that would
lower tariffs and quotas on products from sub-Saharan Africa, the
Caribbean and Central America.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation now goes to President Clinton, who is expected
to sign it quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the measure's provisions will not take effect for
several months, until trade officials can determine which countries
and products are eligible for new privileges.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters cheered passage of the bill as an important first
step to build broader commercial and diplomatic ties between the
United States and some of the world's most impoverished nations.
Opponents, largely from textile states in the South and New
England, warned of crippling job losses for U.S. workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing something for Africa besides sending peace forces
or aid,'' said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., one of the
bill's sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would be the first major trade measure enacted
in the United States since approval of the Uruguay Round in 1994,
which set up the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is separate from an even more contentious China
trade bill before Congress, but Clinton and other supporters of the
China bill hope that approval of the Africa-Caribbean measure will
build momentum for the larger legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The House is to vote on the China bill the week of May 22, but
the outcome is considered too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   The Africa-Caribbean compromise drew broad bipartisan support on
Thursday after months of haggling and after last rites were read
over the legislation more than once.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said the measure will help African nations diversify
their trade with the United States to include apparel and textiles,
and translate into $8 billion in new sales and 120,000 jobs for the
United States over the next five years. Oil, platinum, diamonds and
gold make up about 80 percent of current African exports to United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the House and Senate approved different versions of
the measure. Since then negotiators have sought a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Under Thursday's deal, worked out with the help of the House
Speaker, J. Dennis Hastert, and the Senate majority leader, Trent
Lott, R-Miss., the House agreed to grant many of the same duty-free
benefits to 24 Caribbean and Central American countries that 48
African nations will get.
</P>
<P>
   The House had not included the Caribbean in its legislation
because of objections from lawmakers in textile states. But
senators felt strongly about correcting an unintended consequence
of the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement, which drew much
U.S. investment to Mexico from the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the Senate dropped its insistence that duty-free
imports from Africa be made with fabric, yarn or thread from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   In a concession to textile-makers, the agreement initially caps
the volume of duty-free goods at 1.5 percent of all textile
imports. That cap rises to 3.5 percent over eight years.

BOURQUE RESTED, READY FOR OPENER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF WILSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENGLEWOOD, Colo. _ Defenseman Ray Bourque, who missed the final
three games of the Avalanche's playoff matchup with the Detroit Red
Wings, took part in most of Colorado's 75-minute practice
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing my best and doing what I have to do to get back,''
he said. ``Things are going pretty well. To know exactly when or if
it's going to happen for the opening game, we don't know yet. I'm
getting pretty anxious, I would say.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, 39, who injured his left knee in Game 3 of the
conference semifinals, participated in noncontact drills with
teammates for the second time since suffering the injury in a 3-1
loss on May 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been good,'' he said. ``It's something that I welcome,
giving me some time to get ready. We play Saturday, Monday and then
we don't play until Friday. ... The way it's going, hopefully I'll
be ready.'' \Nsubheds:Budding rivalry Colorado is embroiled in a
rivalry with the Detroit Red Wings, but another with the Stars
could be looming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's starting to be pretty good,'' forward Adam Deadmarsh
said. ``We've had some great games this year, and obviously last
year, seven games in the playoffs. Two very evenly matched teams.
If you go through every aspect of a hockey game and really compare
both teams, you'll find it equal on each side.''
</P>
<P>
   Deadmarsh said the games against the Stars have the same
intensity as a game against Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be ready for a war when you play against them.
They've got a big, strong `D' that loves to hit and punish you. And
we have the same situation on our blue line.'' \Nsubheds:''Slight''
home-ice edge Colorado and the Stars are a combined 12-0 at home
during the playoffs this year. Adam Deadmarsh sees only a
``slight'' edge for the team with home-ice advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always nice to have home-ice advantage. To start at home
is always the way you want to go, but we're not to worried about
it. They played really well at home, but it's a really tough
building to win in. Their fans are great; they seem to get real
excited to play in front of them, and every shift is an important
one at home.'' \Nsubheds:Nothing but time The Avalanche will have
had more than a week between closing out the Red Wings last Friday
and its first game against the Stars tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time,'' forward Peter Forsberg said. ``We're
not going to complain. We had a lot of rest. I think it's better
than worse than less.''
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Patrick Roy is eager to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, you'd like to be playing right away and just get
going, but I don't think it'll have any affect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But facing both teams after Game 2, because of a Tina Turner
concert, is a four-day respite before Game 3 in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the middle of the series, it's a little strange to have
three days off, but I guess there's a concert at the Pepsi
Center,'' Forsberg said. ``There's nothing we can do about it.
We've got to make sure we're ready to play the first two games.''

 &HT;    Elian trial excerpts
 &HT;    Compiled by Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Here are excerpts from the Elian Gonzalez hearing before a panel
of judges of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The judges
are: J.L. Edmondson, Joel Dubina and Charles Wilson. The lawyers
are: Kendall Coffey, representing Elian's Miami relatives; Edwin
Kneedler, representing the U.S. Justice Department; and Gregory B.
Craig, representing Juan Miguel Gonzalez, Elian's father.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Wilson: I'm going to read one of the questions . . . on a
standard form asylum application. One of the questions is, ``Have
you or any member of your family ever belonged to or been
associated with any organization or groups in your home country
such as, but not limited to, a political party, student group,
labor union, religious organization, military or paramilitary
group, civil patrol, guerrilla organization, ethnic group, human
rights group or press or the media?'' You're telling me that a
6-year-old is competent to answer questions like that?
</P>
<P>
   Coffey: Your honor, I don't think a 6-year-old can answer in
detail all of the questions, but what the law says is there is an
age-appropriate process for 6-year-olds. For example, subjective
fear of prosecution, the INS is saying in so many words that
children, if they have difficulty articulating a subjective fear of
prosecution, that is, their own fear, they are implying that they
are disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines say the opposite. What they say is that you
reduce the burden on a child where there is a subjective fear of
persecution precisely because they are young and you look to more
objective factors.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Wilson: I've read the answers. . . on this asylum
application, and they all appear to be written in the third person
and reflect maybe a fear of prosecution on behalf of someone else,
like maybe the person who is submitting the asylum application on
behalf of Elian Gonzalez. Doesn't it appear that this is really an
expression of a fear of prosecution on behalf of someone other than
the petitioner himself?
</P>
<P>
   Coffey: You can certainly have, in a sense, situations where a
child can be subjected to harm because of identification with
family members, no question about that. And here, you have a child
who was identified with a stepfather, a mother who gave her life to
bring him to this country, as well as now, the U.S. relatives, all
of whose actions are crimes in Cuba. Make no mistake about it, this
child's mother... is a traitor.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Edmondson: I think there is law in this country that in
the matters of child custody, child welfare and so forth that
relatives related to a degree of the fourth degree have in Kansas
at least by statute, an absolute right, an absolute right to appear
and to argue the welfare of the child.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I don't say that any of that is binding on the INS, I just
want you to understand that it's not so clear to me that there is
only one intelligent legal response, the parent has the right.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Dubina: What did the INS base its decision on that Elian
did not have the capacity to file a petition for asylum?
</P>
<P>
   Kneedler: Elian at age 6 was far below what was the range of age
suggested in (a previous case) decision . . . and for that reason,
the commissioner had serious doubts that a child of this age could
ever have the capacity to file an application.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Dubina: . . . If Elian's mother had survived this tragic
journey, is there any doubt in your mind that her petition as well
as her son's petition for asylum would have been granted by the
INS?
</P>
<P>
   Kneedler: Well, if his mother had survived, it probably would
not have been necessary to invoke the asylum process, because there
is a special statute in the Cuban Adjustment Act . . . that would
have allowed them to stay, because there, you would have had a
parent who said, ``I want to stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   And the great majority of Cuban-Americans who have come to this
country have come and gotten protection under that general statute,
not under the asylum statute.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Dubina: From everything I've read in this case, I have no
reason to believe that your client is anything but a loving father
to his son. Will you explain to us why it took your client five
months to leave Cuba, to come to the United States to see his son,
after he learned that his son had survived?
</P>
<P>
   Craig: His position throughout this, your honor, was that, if I
was confident that I would be given my son the day I arrived in the
United States, I would have been there immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I've gone back and thought in retrospect would he have had
a chance had he come at that window of time when he first learned
that his boy had been recovered and was OK. And I've looked at what
happened within the 24, 48, 72 hours after the time Elian was . . .
brought to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The very next day as he was being taken out of the hospital and
turned over by the INS to the relatives in Miami, one of the
relatives was quoted in The Miami Herald as saying, ``Heaven has
brought him to freedom, we will not let him go back.'' That was the
first thing that happened.
</P>
<P>
   The very next day, the relatives in Miami retained a lawyer for
the purpose of blocking access to the boy by the father and
blocking his ability to return the son to his father in Cuba. That
happened the very next day.
</P>
<P>
   The following day, which is a Sunday, leaders of the
Cuban-American community in Miami visited the boy and made
announcements to the public press that there was no way that this
boy would be sent back to Cuba to his father.
</P>
<P>
   So already, the ground rules of the battle had been set within
two or three days after this poor boy's arrival and the politics
had intruded into what should have been essentially a family affair
and it's unfortunate and it may well have deterred Juan Miguel's
willingness to go.
</P>
<P>
   I begin with that little history that the signals that were
coming down to Cuba from Miami were, ``We're not going to let this
boy go, no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   The second thing to point out, your honor, is that these are two

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ford Motor Co., which depends on sport utility
vehicles for much of its profit, acknowledged Thursday that they
cause serious safety and environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
   In its first ``corporate citizenship report,'' issued at the
company's annual shareholders' meeting in Atlanta, Ford Motor said
SUVs vehicles contributed more than cars to global warming, emitted
more smog-causing pollution and endangered other motorists. The
automaker said it would keep building them because they are so
profitable, but would seek technological solutions and look for
alternatives to the big vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor's voluntary admission that it faces a ``dilemma''
because its most profitable products are not socially responsible
has few parallels, according to Business for Social Responsibility,
a corporate group in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, William C. Ford Jr., the company's 43-year-old
chairman and a great-grandson of Henry Ford, depicted the company's
statements as a combination of altruism and long-term business
planning. He said he worried that automakers could wind up with
reputations like those of big tobacco companies if they ignored
sport utilities' problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court of public opinion sometimes decides before you're
ready for them to decide, and I want to make sure we're ready and
ahead of the curve,'' said Ford, who became chairman 16 months ago.
The company has sought to portray itself in recent months as the
most environmentally conscious automaker.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ford and Jacques Nasser, Ford Motor's chief executive, said
they had no plans to stop making sport utilities, including the
immense Ford Excursion, which weighs as much as two Jeep Grand
Cherokees and gets just 10 miles to the gallon in the city and 13
on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't provide that vehicle, someone else would, and
they wouldn't provide it as responsibly as we do,'' Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser cautioned that while customers consistently said in
market surveys that they wanted more environmentally responsible
products, they were unwilling to pay more for them or to sacrifice
features on their sport utilities.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two years, Ford Motor has voluntarily built its
sport utilities to emit far less tailpipe pollution than allowed by
law. Ford has also voluntarily installed bars below the bumpers of
the Excursion to reduce the risk that it will override cars during
collisions, even though there are no federal regulations on this.
</P>
<P>
   The company is making progress, Ford said. ``It's sort of a
`watch this space' thing, it's going to get better as time goes
on.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With sport utilities accounting for a fifth of Ford's sales _ up
from 5 percent in 1990 _ and the bulk of its profit, the
automaker's financial stability could be affected if the sport
utility market slumped, warns Standard &AMP; Poor's, the credit rating
agency. While Ford does not release profit margins by model,
financial analysts say that the company earns $10,000 to $15,000
apiece on Ford Expeditions and Lincoln Navigators and up to $18,000
apiece on Ford Excursions; the factory in Wayne, Mich., that builds
the Expedition and Navigator is the world's most profitable in any
industry, generating roughly $3 billion a year in pre-tax profit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Thursday's report clearly expressed the company's concern
that the big vehicles have inherent problems. ``Sustainability
concerns associated with SUVs raise issues relative to Ford's
corporate citizenship commitment,'' the report said, later adding:
``We believe that the steps Ford has taken to date are only a
beginning in addressing the issues raised by these products. Our
task is to develop additional technological solutions and identify
and implement alternative ways to satisfy customers that build a
sustainable competitive advantage while meeting our environmental,
social and economic objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   In a question-and-answer section of Thursday's report, Ford said
that it might be difficult to persuade Wall Street that it was
worthwhile for Ford Motor to take big steps to be perceived as a
progressive, environmentally friendly company. ``Analysts are
focused on the next quarter's report, and at most, your next year's
report,'' he said. ``And the kinds of issues we've been discussing
today have payoffs 5, 10, 20, 50 years down the line. I do believe
that I'm building a stronger Ford Motor Co. for my children and
grandchildren. But that's not a theme that resonates very well with
most analysts.''
</P>
<P>
   John Casesa, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said Wall Street would
tolerate the company's emphasis on social responsibility provided
that it did not prove enormously expensive. ``It's not going to
make the stock go up, it may make the stock go down, but good
companies are respected,'' he said. ``It may take years before
consumers buy a Ford because it's a responsible company, but it
won't take years for regulatory authorities and communities to say,
`This is a company we can work with.'''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Ford family has a long tradition of public service, best
shown by the family charity, the Ford Foundation. The Ford family
controls 40 percent of the votes at Ford Motor through a special
class of shares and will cement its grip under a plan announced
last month in which most shareholders will receive a special
dividend of $20 a share but the Ford family will receive additional
common stock in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's comments Thursday confirm a shift in his position on
sport utilities. An ardent fly fisherman who bought his own fly
fishing rod company, he has been active in environmental causes
since his days at prep school and then Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But he was also one of the company board's most enthusiastic
supporters of the decision to introduce the Ford Expedition
full-sized sport utility vehicle in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Sport utilities are three times as likely as cars to kill the
other driver in a crash, but the death rate for sport utility
occupants is just as high as for car occupants because of sport
utilities' tendency to roll over and their lack of crumple zones.
While current regulations allow large sport utilities to emit up to
5.5 times as much smog-causing pollution a mile as cars, President
Clinton announced rules in December that will require sport
utilities to meet the same standards as cars by 2009.
</P>
<P>
   Business for Social Responsibility said one parallel to Ford's
actions lay in BP Amoco's vow two years ago to reduce the global
warming caused by oil consumption, even though it is the world's
second-largest oil company. Another, less direct parallel lies in
the Liggett Group's acknowledgment in March 1997 that cigarettes
are addictive and cause cancer _ an admission that followed years
of litigation and medical studies, the group said. ``Ford's actions
today place it in a small set of companies,'' said Rebecca Calahan
Klein, the group's vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Top executives at other automakers defended their records for
social responsibility, while acknowledging that sport utility
vehicles posed problems. ``We're every bit as responsible on safety
and environmental issues'' as Ford, said James Holden, the
president of DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler unit, while adding that,
``All of the manufacturers are pursuing whatever we can do on
safety while meeting consumer demands, and sometimes those are at
odds.''
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler canceled in December its well-advanced plans to
build a full-sized Jeep. Bud Liebler, the company's vice president
for marketing, said in January that one reason for the company's
decision had been a fear that safety and environmental concerns
would sour the public on large sport utility vehicles before
Chrysler could get the vehicle to market.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, General Motors plans to increase its production of
full-size sport utilities by 20 percent next year. G.M. declined to
comment today on Ford's position. GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler are
roughly tied in global sport utility sales.
</P>
<P>
   While Ford started the sport utility boom in 1990 with the
introduction of the Ford Explorer, the company has not been as
aggressive in expanding production as its rivals since Ford took
over the leadership of the company at the beginning of last year.
And while automakers usually spend $50 million to $100 million on
advertising to promote a new model, Ford spent just $420,000 in the
fourth quarter of last year to announce the introduction of the
Excursion, according to Competitive Media Research, an ad-tracking
service.

JUDGING GIULIANI: DECORUM OUTWEIGHS MORALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With NY-GIULIANI) 
 By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Over sandwiches and keyboards Thursday, around soda
machines and bus stops, it seemed as if New Yorkers were barely
bothering with the news: the marital problems of Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani and his wife, Donna Hanover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, we knew a long time ago this wasn't much of a
marriage,'' said Sidney Levitan, 89, a retired high school
administrator.
</P>
<P>
   There was even more than a bit of boredom over who was to blame.
``With the kinds of lives they lead, always busy, barely seeing
each other, I mean, how can you really hold a marriage together?''
asked Scott Howell, 24, who works in marketing for an office
products company.
</P>
<P>
   Instead _ in a world where divorce is common, where a
presidential scandal has inured people to accounts of infidelity,
where talk shows obliterate lines between public and private dozens
of times every morning _ the questions Thursday seemed to revolve
less around the dissolution of a marriage and more around the way
the husband and wife were conducting themselves as they do the
dissolving in full public view.
</P>
<P>
   Did Giuliani violate what seemed to be a longstanding agreement
with his wife that they would not discuss their marriage in front
of television cameras? Did he force Hanover into the obviously
uncomfortable position of revealing their personal problems
herself? Was it unfair of Hanover, or beneath her, to mention
publicly that the mayor had had a relationship with a member of his
staff?
</P>
<P>
   Or is either to blame for how the revelations unfolded? Instead,
were they backed into a corner by the media coverage of their
marital problems.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases Thursday, the refrain on street corners and in
Internet chat rooms contained more than hint of hypocrisy. In one
breath, people said that the drama of a political-marriage soap
opera was riveting, and they have, of course, been fixated on every
twist. In the next breath, they said they were ashamed that their
mayor and first lady seemed to have taken the media's bait,
lowering themselves to participate in a slightly more decorous
version of the Jerry Springer Show.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is clear. When it comes to assigning blame for how
that all got started, Giuliani comes in for the brunt of the
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him to go on TV and say he was getting a separation,
without talking to his wife ...'' said John Peterson, 44, scowling
as he finished off his fries at the Roosevelt Field Mall in Garden
City, N.Y. ``If he does this to his family, what will he do to the
people?''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson added: ``You don't do it this way. If you have a
problem, you discuss it with your wife, you discuss it with a
priest or somebody, you come to a civil agreement. You don't just
put it out in the media and crush your wife.''
</P>
<P>
   In dozens of interviews Thursday from Albany to downtown
Brooklyn, the overwhelming sentiment about Giuliani's marital
problems seemed to follow a familiar script that played out among
many voters during the impeachment battle over President Clinton's
affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Those interviewed said that Giuliani's actions within his
marriage should have no political consequences, because his conduct
as a husband has little bearing on his abilities to be a mayor or
even a senator.
</P>
<P>
   But for many, his handling of the announcement on Wednesday that
he was seeking a separation, one that took Hanover by surprise, did
have troubling political implications because it reminded people of
the aggressive _ some called it reckless _ way that Giuliani has
handled many other public disclosures, such as the release of the
arrest record of Patrick Dorismond, the unarmed black man who was
shot to death by the police in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that his comments when Dorismond was killed
indicated a lack of control, a lashing out,'' said Nancy Dubler,
the director of the bioethics division at Montefiore Medical
Center. ``That was the analogy that I thought of when he made this
announcement yesterday, an announcement that both his staff and his
wife were unprepared for. I find that disturbing in someone who's
in a position of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Her feelings served as an apt illustration of a theme that
played out in many interviews: criticism of Giuliani _ and to a
lesser extent of Hanover _ seemed to keep returning more to
considerations of decorum, fairness and grace under pressure than
to morality or marital infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   Dubler said she thought that the mayor's surprise announcement
``showed disregard for his wife's feelings, yes, but that seems to
miss the fact that he lost it, and their presumably carefully
negotiated positions of privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He blew it,'' she added. ``Why, we don't know. It indicates a
lack of control over what you say in challenging situations, where
someone in the mayor's position needs more discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Carrington, an administrative secretary who works with
Dubler, echoed that view. ``Somebody's going to get hurt anyway,''
Carrington said, ``but you can do it in a way to lessen the pain as
much as possible. You can be more responsible in how you approach
it. I'm trying to be objective and not be judgmental, but she
seemed to be very hurt by it.''

 &HT;    Avoiding the limelight

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ She was once the media darling, always ready to give
reporters the quote of the day regarding her cousin Elian Gonzalez,
America's most famous 6-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Marisleysis Gonzales, the 21-year-old Cuban-American
who became the little shipwreck victim's substitute mother of
sorts, was constantly photographed or interviewed. But after Elian
was taken from the Gonzalez home in Miami by INS agents on April
22, the young woman shut down, never talking to reporters, except
in the news conferences where she denounced Attorney General Janet
Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a difficult time for this girl and her family,''
said Jose Garcia Pedroso, an attorney who represents the Gonzalez
family in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, she has shunned the media, smiling demurely or
shaking her head when asked to comment.
</P>
<P>
   It was no different when she arrived in Atlanta this week for
Thursday's hearing in the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. She
was ill for most of Wednesday after she and her entourage lunched
on chicken sandwiches at the CNN complex.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, dressed in a black suit, the young woman again
declined contact with the media even after two reporters crowded
with her into the Embassy Suites glass elevator.
</P>
<P>
   She spoke only after one of the reporters stepped on her foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``One should say excuse me,'' she said, ``when they step on
one's foot.''

DRUG COMPANIES OFFER TALKS TO LOWER PRICES FOR AIDS DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Five pharmaceutical companies offered on Thursday to
negotiate steep cuts in the price of AIDS drugs for Africa and
other poor regions afflicted by the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of negotiations, to be held with the World
Health Organization and other international aid groups, was made in
Geneva. It followed mounting pressures on the companies _ including
a personal appeal from the U.N. secretary general, Kofi Annan, at a
special session on AIDS in December _ to make their therapies more
accessible in regions worst hit by the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Piot, the executive director of UNAids, said on
Thursday, ``This is a promising step in a long-term process.'' He
added, ``Lowering the price of medicines, however, is only one
critical factor in what must become a much broader and more urgent
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   In many parts of Africa, for instance, government health budgets
can be as little as $10 a person a year, and treatment programs are
hard to carry out, even among people who acknowledge having the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Though only one company, Glaxo Wellcome, spoke of any specific
prices, the companies were expected to agree to cuts of 80 percent
and more below their American prices. Drug treatments used in the
United States, most commonly the triple-therapy ``cocktails'' that
suppress the replication of the HIV virus, can cost up to $15,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rolf Krebs, vice chairman of one of the five companies,
Boehringer Ingelheim, which is based in Germany, said, ``This is
the first time that both the public and private sector are joining
forces to implement a major change in the care of HIV/AIDS in the
developing world.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Boehringen, the other companies in Thursday's agreement
are Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck &AMP; Co., both of the United
States, Glaxo Wellcome of Britain, and Hoffmann-La Roche of
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Plumley, an official of Glaxo Wellcome, said the company
would sell its Combivir, a blend of AZT and 3TC that sells at a
global average price of $16, for $2 in poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the agreements, first reported in The Wall
Street Journal, followed several weeks of negotiations. Officials
said the companies negotiated separately to avoid falling afoul of
American price-fixing laws.
</P>
<P>
   The five companies will work with five international agencies,
the World Health Organization, the World Bank, UNAids, the United
Nations Children's Fund and the United Nations Population Fund.
</P>
<P>
   At world trade conferences like the one in Seattle last December
that attracted many protesters, drug companies have been portrayed
as racking up record profits by concentrating on drugs to cure
obesity, baldness and impotence among rich Americans, Western
Europeans and Japanese, who make up 80 percent of the world drug
market, while ignoring dire suffering in places like Africa, which
buys 1 percent of the world's drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Gro Harlem Brundtland, the WHO director general, said in an
interview on Thursday that big pharmaceutical companies had
``analyzed their roles more broadly recently.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's increased awareness that it's not just a question of
securing patent rights around the world for the most expensive
drugs,'' she said. ``The reality of poverty and the affordability
of medical technology has led companies to think about their
policies and postures.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials in Geneva and elsewhere cautioned that cheaper
drugs would not provide a quick fix for the epidemic. They stressed
that controlling AIDS also required a developed health-care system,
which many Third World countries lacked, and that even the slashed
prices might be too high for many patients. They also warned that
the cheap drugs could find their way into black markets in richer
countries.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, sub-Saharan Africa has 80 percent of the
world population of people infected by HIV, the virus that causes
AIDS, though few of those people have ever had an AIDS test. In
much of Africa, the disease is treated as a badge of shame; and the
anti-retrovirals, protease inhibitors and other drugs under
discussion are toxic and difficult to monitor even in patients in
the United States..
</P>
<P>
   In many poor countries, distributing the drugs, teaching people
to take them and monitoring levels of virus, T-cells and drug
residues in the blood is a mammoth task.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be realistic, this is not going to fix the problem, but I'm
cautiously optimistic,'' said Piot, the director of UNAids, the
joint U.N. agency fighting AIDS.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While the agencies involved in Thursday's accord emphasized the
hope of lower prices, the drug companies focused on joint
principles for tackling the epidemic. These include stronger
government efforts, better drug-distribution systems, and more
funding from donors, all matters outside the corporate world. Who
would pay to create such standards remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs to treat the epidemic are used to control replication of
HIV. Other medicines used are strong antibiotic and anti-fungal
drugs for the infections that arise with AIDS; these include
Bristol-Myers' Fungizone.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting prices is in some ways a risky concession by the
companies. Soaring prescription prices in the United States have
led some lawmakers to call for European-style price controls. If
the drug companies effectively admit they can sell a drug at an 80
percent discount, they risk congressional pressure to lower
Medicare prices. But over time, the industry argues, skimpy prices
would strangle their immense research budgets and the flow of
valuable new drugs would stop.
</P>
<P>
   Some AIDS activists argue that the companies are lowering prices
simply to forestall the seizure of their patents by Third World
countries desperate for the drugs. Thailand and South Africa have
recently passed laws allowing that seizure; India, Bangladesh and
Brazil have drug industries that ignore patent treaties.
</P>
<P>
   Just Wednesday, the Clinton administration angered the drug
industry by issuing an executive order saying the government would
not interfere with African countries that violate American patent
law to obtain cheaper AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The companies denied that they had asked for any concessions,
such as demanding that countries pass tough patent laws or that the
U.N. agencies endorse them. ``No, we're not asking for a ban on
parallel imports or compulsory licensing,'' said Jacqueline
Wallace, a Roche press spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The fear of all five companies is that corruption in poor
countries is so rampant that millions of their cut-rate pills will
disappear and go north to rich countries to cannibalize their
full-price sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's precisely one of the things that's worried us,'' said
Jeffrey Sturchio of Merck &AMP; Co. ``That's something we hope this
initiative will be able to address.''

 &HT;    Dell ends quarter on a high note
 &HT;    By John Pletz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ After two quarters of missing Wall Street's
expectations, Dell Computer Corp. returned to its old form during
the first quarter, posting higher-than-expected earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Dell got over the Y2K hangover and saw strong growth in sales of
more-profitable servers and notebook computers during the quarter
ended April 28, the company reported Thursday. Costs of parts, such
as chips, also were lower than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue climbed 31.5 percent to $7.3 billion from $5.5 billion a
year ago, and net income climbed 21 percent to $525 million from
$434 million.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's stock _ which has been battered along with the rest of
the tech sector in recent weeks _ fell 25 cents to $44.69 a share
during regular-session trading before results were released. The
stock rebounded in after-hours trading, climbing as high as $48.13
before settling back to close at $47.69. Some of the Round
Rock-based company's net income gains were driven mainly by strong
returns in its investments.
</P>
<P>
   Operating income _ the company's profits from its core business
_ was relatively flat at $625 million, compared with $600 million
in the year-ago quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings per share were 19 cents, compared with 16 cents in the
same period a year ago. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson
Financial said they had been expecting the company to earn 16 cents
per share.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings per share got a two-cent boost from gains Dell made on
investments in young companies preparing to go public.
</P>
<P>
   The company, the No. 1 PC seller in the United States and No. 2
worldwide behind Compaq Computer Corp., has been trying to sell
more profitable products, such as servers and notebook computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's still the group, in our view, to watch, along with
portables,'' said Amir Ahari, an analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray. ``The high-margin business is helping them go through the
(first-quarter) crunch.''
</P>
<P>
   In the desktop computer business, where profit margins have
declined steadily, accounted for 52 percent of the Dell's total
sales in the quarter, down from 61 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of enterprise products _ servers, storage units and
high-end workstations _ rose 52 percent and now account for 18
percent of Dell's revenue. Notebook sales rose 67 percent, and
account for 30 percent of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Dell also benefited from timing. Most computer makers struggled
hard during the first quarter and saw corporate sales return to
normal in February and March. Dell, which uses fiscal calendar that
puts its first quarter between the end of January and April, caught
more of the rebound in the period.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big growth engines are in the entertainment and notebook
areas as well as home and small business,'' said Vice Chairman
Kevin Rollins. ``Our home-and-small business sales globally were up
62 percent from a year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   That sector was a key factor in helping Dell's struggling
European business. Sales in Europe rose 17 percent, which is better
than the disappointing 8 percent growth in the fourth quarter but
still below the traditional 22 percent range. Dell told analysts
that Internet-related sales, a key focus for the company, showed
strong progress, too. Sales to dot-com companies and providers of
Internet service and applications have grown more than 250 percent
in the last six months.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street also is waiting to see how Dell's new storage
products from last fall's acquisition of ConvergeNet will fare.
Dell originally hoped to release a product in the summer, but the
company said earlier it won't happen until fall.

SEXUAL HARASSMENT KEPT UNDER WRAPS, FEMALE OFFICERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Out of the blue, when they were cooling down after
their regular morning jog, a colonel was groped by her male running
partner, another colonel who forcefully tried to embrace her, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were back at my house and he just sort of pushed himself on
me,'' the woman said. ``I pushed him back and said `no' and that
was it.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who is now one of the military's senior officers and
insists that her name not be revealed, said she did not report this
unwanted sexual advance when it happened a few years ago. She said
she feared that her reputation and her career could have been
ruined if she filed an official complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the news this week that the Army inspector general,
acting on a formal sexual harassment complaint, found that Lt. Gen.
Claudia Kennedy was the victim of inappropriate sexual advances
from another Army general, the senior officer who said she was
accosted after jogging still believes she did the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's career was hurt, not mine and not his,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Kennedy, the Army's highest-ranking woman, has
revived the question of how pervasive sexual harassment remains in
the military and how such cases should be handled. Women in the
military are reluctant to file harassment complaints, many female
officers said, because they fear opening their personal lives to
examination and being blamed for inviting a sexual advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, instead of being remembered as the first woman to earn
three stars in the Army, she is going to be remembered as that
woman with the sex complaint,'' said the senior officer who, like
most of the other 15 senior officers interviewed for this article,
spoke only on the condition that she not be identified. Of those
officers, all but three said they had been the target of sexual
harassment in the military.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, these 13 women all said that, to protect their
careers, they never reported a one-time case of sexual harassment.
They marveled that Kennedy, so close to retirement, would have
subjected herself to the backlash and tarnished reputation that
would inevitably come from making a sexual harassment charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``She could have ignored this,'' said another officer. ``I
suspect right now some companies that might have considered her for
employment may not now because of the high visibility of this
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The women said they generally accepted Kennedy's story that she
made the complaint against Maj. Gen. Larry Smith four years after
the incident only upon learning that he had been appointed deputy
inspector general of the Army, a position that included
investigating cases of sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   There could be no other reason, they said, to willingly open
oneself to the personal scrutiny that would come with reporting an
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Under military guidelines, a victim of a one-time incident is
advised to handle the problem herself, unless it is a flagrant
assault. If the harasser makes a second attempt, that is cause for
a complaint. Most of those cases are handled with counseling or
letters of reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   In more serious cases, the charge is rarely sexual harassment;
it is more likely to be maltreatment of a subordinate or assault
and battery.
</P>
<P>
   Women who are senior officers today _ lieutenant colonel or
higher in the Army and Air Force, commander or higher in the Navy,
and command sergeant majors in the enlisted ranks _ were among the
first to integrate their services. They watched as the parade of
public sexual scandals in the military mirrored their private
stories.
</P>
<P>
   They said that during the 1980s, when they were junior officers,
they put up with wolf whistles and catcalls as well as outright
sexual assaults, waiting for the services to change. As they rose
in rank and the military began cracking down on inappropriate
behavior, the harassment became more subtle, ``stealthlike'' in the
words of more than one woman, like getting nuzzled on the dance
floor or having legs massaged under a dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   The progression from the 1991 Tailhook scandal, when 26 women in
the Navy were sexually assaulted at a convention, leading to the
resignation of three admirals and a secretary of the Navy, to the
spectacle in 2000 of a female general accusing a male counterpart
of sexual harassment, reflects how the military has changed _ but
not enough to ensure a woman, regardless of rank, is protected
against the humiliation of sexual harassment, according to the
female officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes so much courage for a woman to come forward with a
complaint,'' said Lt. Col. Elspeth Cameron Ritchie, a forensic
psychiatrist in the Army who works with women who bring charges of
sexual assault, the description that Kennedy has told friends she
believes best describes her encounter.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is most likely to happen is a negative effect on your
career,'' Ritchie said. The women who bring charges against a man
resign from the Army within a year, she said, whether the man was
found guilty or innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Often, Ritchie said, the victims of harassment in the military
have the same reaction: ``Shame, humiliation and wanting to get out
of the service _ they leave within one year.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In recent polls, surveys and reports, incidents of sexual
harassment are down in the military. Even the female senior
officers said they believed all branches of the military have made
progress in combating sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   But the legal and medical experts who supervise these cases say
the figures are low, because most cases go unreported.
</P>
<P>
   The latest figures from the Department of Defense show a
dramatic decrease from 1,599 in 1993 to 558 in 1998. But a top
military legal expert in the department said ``those numbers are on
the low end'' because so many incidents are not reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to be pretty skeptical of those figures _ they are
not going to capture the vast majority of sexual harassment
cases,'' said the senior officer, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   To these experts and many of the female officers interviewed,
the case of Kennedy is typical rather than an aberration _ a woman
who followed the rules and then got caught in the Catch-22 nature
of reporting sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pendulum may have swung from vilifying a woman to saying,
`Hey, if you have substance to your complaint, the Army will take
action,''' said retired Army Brig. Gen. Evelyn Foote. ``But we have
not come as far as we should have come as far as treating everyone
with dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   In a blizzard of e-mail messages and private conversations over
the last month, enlisted women as well as junior and senior
officers are questioning the reporting policies of the military and
searching for a middle ground that would allow women to make a
complaint without risking their careers in unwanted publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm angry and getting angrier by the day,'' wrote one senior
officer, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``What
message does this send to young women?''
</P>
<P>
   Without knowing how many cases go unreported, the women said,
they are wondering how different the military is from civilian
life.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, charges of sexual harassment in the civilian
workplace have risen by 150 percent, from 6,127 cases in 1990 to
15,222 cases last year, according to figures compiled by the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy case has prompted female senior officers to tell
each other and their male colleagues their own stories of sexual
harassment to underscore that Kennedy was not the only senior
officer who resisted reporting a sexual advance.
</P>
<P>
   One woman who is now a higher-ranking officer said that over
five years ago, when she was still a lieutenant colonel, she asked
her boss for advice about advanced training schools. In response,
he requested oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went in to talk to my commanding officer, a colonel, about
which officer training school I would attend and he said he could
get me in anywhere I wanted to go if I would do it for him,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She turned around, walked out of the office without saying a
word and spent the next three days asking herself what she had done
wrong. She said she seriously thought about retiring from the
military.
</P>
<P>
   ``It changed my life,'' she said. ``I feel it just as deeply
today as I did then. I was personally and professionally cut to the
core.''
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Maj. Gen. Susan L. Pamerleau, one of the few officers
who agreed to be named, said she has wrestled with the question of
reporting sexual harassment and the complicated messages coming out
of the Kennedy case. She said she had done exactly what Kennedy did
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past I've experienced inappropriate behavior and I have
personally dealt with it,'' she said. But, echoing the sentiments
of most of the other officers, she said, ``the fact that General
Kennedy raised the issue and that the military gave it such
importance does say we are serious about creating an environment
free of harassment and discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial Army inquiry substantiated the claim of Kennedy that
Smith grabbed her and tried to kiss her in her office at the
Pentagon in 1996, according to Pentagon officials. The vice-chief
of the Army will now review the case and make his finding. Then
Smith has the right to rebut the finding, which could lead to
further investigations, before the vice-chief makes a final
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general of the Pentagon will then review the case
to ensure that there are no procedural problems.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Tailhook scandal in 1991, the Pentagon and the
individual services created anti-harassment policies and took steps
to crack down on the problem, including special training on sexual
harassment for personnel at all ranks, telephone hot lines for
reporting harassment, handbooks and posters explaining regulations,
and the addition of more equal opportunity officers to advise
commanders at all levels.
</P>
<P>
   But in the circumscribed world of the military, where it is hard
to tell when the professional day ends and private life begins,
women and men are together from early morning exercise to the last
beer at the officer's club or barracks. And despite the new
policies, sexual harassment remains a problem, particularly for
women in the junior ranks.
</P>
<P>
   One woman tapped the work of military strategist Karl von
Clausewitz to describe what it is like to have spent the last 20 to
30 years integrating the military. She pointed to his theory of
friction, how the countless small things on a battlefield that a
commander cannot control may come together and have a cumulative
effect that is devastating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same when you are a woman in the military and you put
up with the little slights _ the hesitation to salute, soldiers
calling you mom instead of ma'am, hearing the old debate about
whether we belong in the military and then some event happens to
you, real sexual harassment, and that puts you over the top and you
are out of here,'' she said.

pollution and endangered other motorists. Ford said that it would
keep building them because they are so profitable but would seek
technological solutions and look for alternatives to the big
vehicles. William C. Ford Jr., the company's chairman, depicted the
company's statements as a combination of altruism and long-term
business planning.

CHINA LIKELY TO MODERNIZE NUCLEAR ARMS, U.S. BELIEVES
</HEADLINE>
  By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration, responding to a
detailed public warning by China against proposed national missile
defenses, said Thursday that it believed Beijing would go ahead
with modernizing its nuclear forces regardless of Washington's
plans for a new system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether or not we proceed with national missile defense,
China's nuclear forces would expand in a way that would make this
system less threatening to China,'' said a senior administration
official who briefed reporters on arms control at the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The official, an expert in arms control, sounded an apparently
conciliatory note by saying that while the administration had
explained to China that the proposed system was designed to defend
against ``rogue'' states like North Korea and not against China,
there had been insufficient discussion with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had the kind of deep national security or
international security dialogue with China that we would like to
have for the last couple of years because of the continuing fallout
from the embassy bombing,'' the official said, referring to the
American strike against the Chinese embassy in Belgrade last May
during the air war over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Wednesday in Beijing, China's chief arms
negotiator, Sha Zukang, said that if Washington proceeded with
deployment of missile defenses, ``we will not sit on our hands.''
He described the missile shield as a threat to China's security and
outlined several possible responses, including producing more
nuclear warheads and devising ways to erode the effectiveness of
the missile shield with decoys.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, the strongest proponents of a missile system
interpreted Sha's warnings as confirmation of the need to proceed
with the program.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
who favors a more robust defense than the limited version now under
discussion, asked how China could criticize the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``After issuing nuclear threat after nuclear threat, China now
has the nerve to complain that a U.S. missile defense is a threat
to their security?'' he said. ``To the contrary, leaving the
American people vulnerable to Beijing's nuclear blackmail is a
threat to U.S. national security.''
</P>
<P>
   Another proponent of the missile defense, Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz.,
said he regretted that Sha interpreted the system as a threat to
China. ``This or any other system is purely defensive in nature,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have only recently focused on China's
concerns about the missile program. Japan and Australia,
Washington's allies in the Pacific, have expressed concern that the
system will unsettle the relationship between the United States and
China.
</P>
<P>
   After President Clinton announced in January 1999 that he would
seek, under certain conditions, to deploy missile defenses, the
administration paid most attention to Russia. For the system to go
ahead, the 1972 Anti-Ballisitc Missile Treaty signed by the United
States and the Soviet Union needs to be amended.
</P>
<P>
   In a trip to Beijing earlier this year, Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott and a group of senior officials sought to
explain to the Chinese, including Sha, that the system was not a
threat to China and was not being built because of concerns about
China.
</P>
<P>
   But according to several accounts, the Chinese found the
American arguments unconvincing.
</P>
<P>
   This was in large part because China, unlike Russia, does not
have a large nuclear arsenal capable of overwhelming the limited
program proposed by the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, China's nuclear capacity would be sharply limited even by
the limited system that Washington insists is designed to thwart
North Korea. Western experts estimate that China has 13 to 20
land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, with one warhead
each.
</P>
<P>
   The administration official who briefed reporters Thursday said
China had maintained ``a very small force level of some 20,
roughly, ICBM's.''
</P>
<P>
   A spirited debate has been under way among intelligence
authorities in the past year about China's nuclear missile plans
and what role Washington's missile proposal is playing the
development of those plans.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts believe that a national missile defense would
encourage China to speed up its modernization effort in ways that
it would not otherwise consider.
</P>
<P>
   One of steps China would be likely to take is building missiles
capable of carrying many warheads, each capable of being
independently programmed to hit separate targets, according to
Jonathan Pollack, an expert on the Chinese military at the Rand
Corp.

and cliches and just plain nothing for star Jamie Foxx to do.

   TV-JESUS _ With the Messiah portrayed as a party-loving,
joke-playing average guy and Satan done up like an Armani-clad,
heavily moussed Hollywood mogul, the CBS miniseries ``Jesus'' runs
little risk of being confused with anyone's idea of Sunday school.
But ``Jesus'' is more than just all right. It is enjoyable, and
director Roger Young, a veteran of such biblical TV projects as
``Joseph,'' ``Moses'' and ``Solomon,'' has made ``Jesus'' relevant
and reverent.

 &HT;    Court dismisses case against school district
 &HT;    By Martha Ashe
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The Texas Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed a
lawsuit against the Waco school district and its promotion policy,
ruling the suit was filed before any students were affected by the
policy.
</P>
<P>
   The court majority, in a 6-3 decision, said the four plaintiffs
in the case showed no evidence of damage from the promotion policy,
which requires students pass a state-mandated test.
</P>
<P>
   McLennan County Commissioner Lester Gibson, one of the four who
filed the suit, said Thursday he is considering filing a new
lawsuit should other legal avenues fail.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling, the court said there were no test results
available when the lawsuit was filed in April 1998 to show that the
plaintiffs had been damaged by the promotion policy.
</P>
<P>
   Waco Independent School District's policy, implemented in the
1997-98 school year, requires students pass the Texas Assessment of
Academic Skills test before advancing to the next grade. Test
scores from that year were not available until May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   If students fail the test, the policy requires they participate
in a remediation plan and take the test again.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . The Court's decision still turns on the fact that when
the plaintiffs sued, no test results were available, and no
evidence of the probability of the remediation's success or failure
existed,'' Justice Craig Enoch wrote in the majority opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice Nathan Hecht wrote that the
court majority was wrong in concluding that the plaintiffs could
not prove damage because their claim does not consider the success
of remediation.
</P>
<P>
   Hecht, joined by Chief Justice Thomas Phillips and Justice
Priscilla Owen, said the majority ``ignores the fact that any child
allowed to attempt remediation . . . will be openly stigmatized as
having failed the test . . .,'' which would violate confidentiality
of test scores.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs, including Gibson and his wife, former school
board president Coque Gibson, claim in the lawsuit that use of the
test for promotion purposes is illegal and breaches students'
confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   Lester Gibson met Thursday with attorney Michael Roberts to
discuss the court's decision and review options for future action.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson said he is considering filing a request for another
hearing before the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs also will pursue a lawsuit pending in a Travis County
district court, which they filed after the state education
commissioner denied an administrative complaint, Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   Should those avenues fail, Gibson said plaintiffs will consider
filing a new lawsuit in state district court.
</P>
<P>
   The legality of the promotion policy itself has yet to be
addressed in court through this lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sooner or later, WISD is going to have to address'' whether
the policy is legal, Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   But Phil McCleery, WISD's attorney, said actions by courts and
the Texas Legislature since the suit was filed serve as ``strong
evidence of the legality of the policy.''
</P>
<P>
   A federal court in San Antonio last year ruled in another
lawsuit that the state can require students to pass the TAAS before
earning a high school diploma.
</P>
<P>
   The legislature last year adopted a more lenient promotion
policy similar to WISD's that holds students accountable for TAAS
scores at only three grade levels.
</P>
<P>
   McCleery also said the ``success of the policy'' should
discourage anyone from filing a lawsuit against the district.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the first year the promotion policy was implemented,
nearly 10.5 percent of first- through third-graders were retained.
In 1999, scores rose significantly and retentions dropped to about
7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   WISD officials received scores from this year's TAAS test this
week, but administrators said they will not know until later this
month how many students will be retained.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, a portion of the original lawsuit remains pending
in 74th District Judge Alan Mayfield's court in Waco.
</P>
<P>
   That portion of the test, which alleges WISD violated the Open
Meetings Act by developing the promotion policy in illegal closed
committee meetings of the WISD board, has not been addressed in
court.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield in May 1998 dismissed the portion of the lawsuit
relative to Thursday's Supreme Court hearing, saying he didn't have
jurisdiction because administrative remedies had not been pursued,
but left intact the portion of the suit involving the Open Meetings
Act.
</P>
<P>
   Waco's 10th Court of Appeals later sent the case back to
Mayfield's court for a temporary injunction hearing. Mayfield
denied an injunction, then recused himself from further involvement
in the case.
</P>
<P>
   WISD Superintendent Rosanne Stripling said Thursday's court
ruling ended the battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased that this issue has been resolved,''
Stripling said. ``We felt that Judge Alan Mayfield's ruling was
right, and this affirms it. We're glad this is over.''

DESPITE BROAD SUPPORT, PIPELINE SAFETY LEGISLATION UP IN THE AIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHARLES POPE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite bipartisan support in Congress, the backing
of the White House and the galvanizing memory of last year's
firestorm in Washington state, prospects for passing pipeline
safety legislation anytime soon appear murky.
</P>
<P>
   That realization has spurred a renewed push to approve tougher
standards in the wake last June's pipeline explosion in Bellingham,
Wash., which killed two 10-year-boys and an 18-year-old man. The
fire was touched off after a pipeline ruptured and spilled 275,000
gallons of gasoline into a creek.
</P>
<P>
   What hope there is for quick action rests in the Senate, which
could send a pipeline bill to the floor by early next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am committed to moving a comprehensive pipeline ... bill
through the legislative process as soon as possible,'' said Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Commerce Committee. His
committee Tuesday heard wrenching testimony from the parents of
those killed in the June 10 fire, as well as comments from members
of congress and government officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must act to help improve pipeline safety and prevent future
tragedies like that which occured in Bellingham,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the House, the only attention has been a hearing before a
House subcommittee last year on a bill introduced by Rep. Jack
Metcalf, R-Wash., who represents Bellingham.
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf wrote Wednesday to Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., chairman of
the Transportation Committee handling his bill, beseeching him to
quicken the pace. Metcalf's fear is that if progress isn't made
soon, there will not be enough time in an already shortened
legislative session to bring the bill to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Shuster acknowledged that the safety bill is not
among the committee's top priorities. The aide said there has been
no date set to consider it.
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf's bill, and similar Senate versions backed by Sens.
Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Slade Gorton, R-Wash., would require
safety certification of pipeline employees, public notification of
leaks, periodic internal inspections of pipelines and a nationwide
map pinpointing the location of pipelines. That map would be
available through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   All the bills attempt to address what their authors believe is
lax oversight by the federal Office of Pipeline Safety as well as
spotty efforts by pipeline owners to maintain equipment, train
operators and ensure safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 2.2 million miles of pipelines running across this
country,'' Murray told the Senate committee Thursday. ``We cannot
wait any longer, and we certainly cannot let this year pass without
improving our nation's inadequate pipeline safety laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton was equally adamant. ``At tragic cost, we have obtained a
chance now that we will not have next year,'' he said. ``The
accident in Bellingham and the tireless efforts of the families of
the victims ... have catalyzed interest in this issue, interest
that I'm afraid will wane if we do not act now.''
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf has been leading the effort in the House, and is
intensifying a personal lobbying campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year's deadly pipeline accident in Bellingham ... focused
nationwide attention on the issue of pipeline safety,'' Metcalf
wrote to Shuster. ``We believe that the time is ripe'' for the
Transportation Committee to consider a bill, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf also pointed out that the Senate committee handling
similar legislation ``appears poised to move ... soon. It is
important for the House to affirm its commmitment to the safety of
our communities by passing a bill as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   He also is targeting members in such states as New York, New
Jersey, Minnesota, Georgia, Ohio, Florida and California that have
endured pipeline accidents in recent years. That effort paid off
when Reps. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio and John Lewis, D-Ga., agreed to
support his bill.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any doubt about the human toll of pipeline
accidents it was quickly and solemly dispelled when the parents of
those killed in Bellingham spoke to the committee Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   One of them was Mary King, whose 10-year-old son, Wade, was
killed as he played near the creek that filled with gas and then
ignited.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mother remembers, the silence is deafening,'' King said,
breaking into tears as she recited a poem she wrote in memory of
her son. ``A school bus drives by, my child is not there. ... My
son forever is 10 years old. My arms seem so empty.''
</P>
<P>
   When she finished, her husband, Frank, described how he found
his son and his son's friend, Stephen Tsorvious, who each were
burned over 90 percent of their body. ``The skin was literally
dripping off their fingers,'' said King, who was interrupted gently
by McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. King, I'm not sure that is necessary,'' McCain said of the
graphic testimony.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the four-hour hearing, little had been resolved
beyond the visceral realization of loss suffered by Bellingham and
the need for tougher standards.
</P>
<P>
   King, a car dealer who had scant experience with congressional
politics, could not predict what might happen next.
</P>
<P>
   Except for this: ``To me, it's a no-brainer. These changes are
needed. But if it doesn't happen, the next accident will bring me
back here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope a town doesn't get blown off the face of the Earth
first.''

HOUSE APPROVES $45 BILLION ENVIRONMENTAL MEASURE
</HEADLINE>
  By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House overwhelmingly approved a sweeping
environmental measure on Thursday that sets aside $45 billion over
15 years to buy parks and open spaces, pay for wildlife protection
and restore damaged coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
   By far the biggest environmental initiative of this
congressional session, the bill was supported by large numbers of
Republicans as well as Democrats, reflecting the election-year
appeal of a plan that would channel large sums of money back to
home districts and give lawmakers a chance to cast what many
portrayed as a vote on behalf of the environment.
</P>
<P>
   By redirecting money the government collects from oil drilling
royalties, the bill would commit about $3 billion annually over 15
years to buy private lands considered at risk from development, to
repair coastal lands harmed by oil drilling, to rebuild eroded
beaches and to help communities create soccer fields and bicycle
paths.
</P>
<P>
   In its broadest terms, the measure has support from the White
House but faces an uncertain future in the Senate, where its
prospects may hinge on a handful of Republicans who regard it as a
threat to private property rights.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement on Thursday, Secretary of the Interior Bruce
Babbitt warned against changes that might weaken conservation
provisions in the measure. Babbitt said that a strong act could
leave ``a legacy of parks, green space, wildlife habitat, and
recreational and historic treasures for future generations.''
</P>
<P>
   By any gauge, the vote _ 315-102 in favor of the measure _ was a
powerful indication of bipartisan support. If the bill becomes law,
it would more than double the government's budget for land
acquisition and would institute the broader principle that revenue
from oil and gas leases ought to be channeled toward environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest dollar commitment that American has made
to the conservation of resources in the last 25 years, and maybe
even forever,'' said Rep. George Miller of California, the ranking
Democrat on the House Resources Committee, who has been an
outspoken advocate of conservation issues.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare alliance that reflected the broader bipartisanship,
Miller worked closely in drafting the bill with Rep. Don Young of
Alaska, the Republican who heads the committee. The two men usually
find themselves at opposing sides of environmental questions.
</P>
<P>
   Among the states that would stand to gain most under the
measure, Alaska with its long coastline and extensive oil drilling
ranks high on the list, with $163 million to be set aside for
conservation efforts by local, state and federal agencies.
California, Florida, Louisiana and Texas would be among other big
beneficiaries, but every state would receive some money. New York
would receive about $102 million, including about $28 million for
land acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the measure would devote $900 million a year for land
acquisition, with the money to be divided equally between the
federal and state governments. The legislation does not identify
land to be acquired. The federal budget for buying land is now
about $370 million.
</P>
<P>
   A separate package of $1 billion a year would be set aside for
the restoration of coastal areas, including measures to restore
wetlands, ease beach erosion and otherwise repair to local
ecosystems affected by oil drilling. Other financing would be
allocated for wildlife conservation, historic preservation,
Indian-land restoration, and urban parks and recreation programs.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government now collects about $4 billion annually
from oil and gas leases, mostly for drilling rights in the Gulf of
Mexico and Alaska. That money has long been treated as general
revenue, but in allocating $3 billion of those funds the measure
requires that they be spent only for environmental purposes.
</P>
<P>
   A more modest measure proposed by President Clinton last year
would have set aside $1.4 billion a year for ``land legacy''
programs, and some lawmakers have criticized the House bill as a
unwise blow to budget discipline. But the White House expressed
support for the measure after lawmakers rewrote provisions that had
seemed to hold out incentives for communities that allowed oil
drilling.
</P>
<P>
   Among the bill's opponents were nearly all members of the House
Republican leadership, as well as some rank-and-file Republicans
who have denounced the program as an affront to private-property
rights.
</P>
<P>
   But the leaders said that the breadth of support for the measure
that was expressed by other Republicans left them with little
alternative but to allow it to come to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, 118 Republicans joined 196 Democrats and one
independent in voting for the measure. Ninety-three Republicans,
eight Democrats and one independent voted no.
</P>
<P>
   The battle now shifts to the Senate, whose rules make it easier
for individual lawmakers to disrupt passage. A bipartisan majority
appears to favor the measure, but Western Republicans have
indicated that they may try to derail it on property-rights
grounds.

 &HT;    Protesters vent wrath at Castro
 &HT;    By Mark Bixler
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dan Hernandez has never been to Cuba, but his parents,
who left in 1961, have told him of the bad times.
</P>
<P>
   They have more recently criticized Juan Miguel Gonzalez, the
Cuban whose son, Elian, was found on an inner tube off the Florida
coast last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard some stories,'' said Hernandez, a 35-year-old
college student who held up a sign Wednesday that he made on his
home computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian's Father Is Unfit,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was one of about 45 demonstrators who hissed, cheered,
screamed, clapped and chanted outside the 11th Circuit Court of
Appeals in Atlanta on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers and judges stuck to dry legal language in the courtroom,
but the street outside was alive with emotion. People trembled and
cursed. They got red in the face and wagged their fingers talking
about whether Elian should live with relatives in Miami or go back
to Cuba with his dad.
</P>
<P>
   On hand to document the spectacle was an army of news reporters
and photographers strong enough to muster 23 satellite TV trucks,
18 SUVs and a helicopter or two. Dozens of police officers stood
behind barricades while colleagues on motorcycles, bikes and horses
kept an eye on the crowd. Rembe Rodriguez, 15, a 10th grader, and
his 9-year-old brother, Ignacio, held a sign that said ``Castro's
Cuba : New and Improved Apartheid.'' They were born in the United
States but said their parents and grandparents, who were born in
Cuba, taught them about Fidel Castro's regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm grateful I can be here and express myself,'' Rembe said.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators yelled encouragement in English and Spanish
when Elian's Miami relatives left the courthouse. They denounced
Gregory Craig, attorney for Juan Miguel Gonzalez, when he faced TV
cameras to read a hand-written statement.
</P>
<P>
   There were light moments.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurateur Christman Hampton strolled towards the crowd
holding a posterboard menu hawking ``Eggs Elian for $3.50'' at his
nearby Dugout Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're going to keep protesting, I have good food.''
</P>
<P>
   At a day care center near the courthouse, a handful of toddlers
pressed their faces against a window overlooking the protest. Some
pointed with chubby fingers at all the people outside. Others just
smiled.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen people or so showed up to support Juan Miguel
Gonzalez. Jim Wolbrink and Alice Chen held a sign urging support
for ``parental rights over politics.'' They met in an online
chatroom called the ``Elian Gonzalez Message Board'' and each paid
about $200 to fly to Atlanta from Detroit and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Zizza, 31, said courts pay more attention to mothers than
fathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the mother was in Cuba saying, `I want my son! I want my
son!' we would be, like, `How can we separate a mother from her
son?' Juan and fathers like myself fight for fatherhood.''

OUTSIDER IS OUT AFTER BAD YEAR AT XEROX HELM 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Xerox Corp., besieged by competition and a battered stock price,
ousted its chief executive, G. Richard Thoman, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Anne M. Mulcahy, 47, head of the company's general markets
organization, was named president and chief operating officer.
Because those were the titles Thoman held before being named chief
executive, Mulcahy's promotion seemed to elevate her to heir
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not and are not going to look outside for the next
CEO,'' said Paul A. Allaire, the chairman, who has assumed the
chief executive post for now.
</P>
<P>
   The ouster apparently took Thoman, 55, by surprise. In an
interview last Friday, he acknowledged that Mulcahy ``has a good
chance at being my successor'' but made it clear that he expected
to remain chief executive for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board and I agreed,'' Thoman said in an interview
Thursday, ``that it made more sense to implement our strategy with
an internal team. And I'm a very big shareholder, and a lot of my
future net worth is dependent on how well Paul and Anne do.''
</P>
<P>
   Allaire, who preceded Thoman as chief executive, said the board
moved now to install the new team in time for the company's annual
meeting next Thursday. But analysts said they were concerned that
more was at play.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to wonder if April's numbers turned out to be a lot
worse than they expected,'' said Gibboney Huske, an analyst with
Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Thoman's 13-month reign at Xerox has been marked by more
troubles than triumphs. Xerox hired him away from IBM in 1997 to be
president of the company, with the clear understanding that he
would succeed Allaire as chief executive. It was the first time the
company, which is based in Stamford, Conn., had put an outsider in
its top slot, and Thoman was expected to churn out new products and
technologies and generally invigorate the stodgy culture at Xerox.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the company has had weak sales overseas, particularly
in Brazil. In the United States, fierce competition has kept prices
down for printers and lower-end copiers. Even the Xerox Docutech
line of superfast digital copiers, which command prices well over
$200,000, is facing competition: both Canon Inc. and Heidelberger
Druckmaschinen AG, which bought Eastman Kodak's copier business
last year, now have high-speed products.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Xerox, which traded in triple digits two years ago,
have been in free fall for the last year. Xerox closed Thursday at
$25.50, down $2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was convinced Thoman wouldn't survive the year,'' said Brian
L. Merriman, president of Danka Business Systems, one of Canon's
main distributors. ``If they're going to get aggressive, flexible
and fast enough to compete with the Japanese, they'll need a new
management team.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Xerox has also faced internal tumult. It has eliminated more
than 14,000 jobs in the last two years to reduce costs. It
consolidated many back-office operations last year, causing
backlogs in accounts receivables and billing problems. And it
rejiggered its sales territories, long organized by geography,
around customer industries. Chaos has resulted, as sales
representatives try to acquaint themselves with new accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The company has also been slow to increase sales on its Web
page. ``Their e-business strategy hasn't been clear to customers or
to the street,'' said Stephen Goldstein, vice president of
Renaissance Strategy, a consulting firm that has worked with Xerox.
</P>
<P>
   Mulcahy would not be her industry's first woman executive _
Carly Fiorina, the chief executive at Hewlett-Packard, to whom
Mulcahy bears an uncanny physical resemblance, got there first. But
Mulcahy has scored a number of firsts in her 24-year career with
Xerox.
</P>
<P>
   She has run sales territories in New York City and Boston that
had long been male bastions. In 1985, as head of the Xerox human
resources organization, she became the company's first female
officer. Last year, she led Xerox's first forays onto the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Now she leads the company's fastest growing new entity, the
general markets organization _ a $6 billion business, started in
January 1999, that concentrates on selling Xerox products to small
businesses and consumers. That means pushing Xerox into superstores
like CompUSA and other distribution channels that have long been
Hewlett's forte.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year Mulcahy masterminded the purchase of
Tektronix, a $1 billion business that finally gave Xerox a line of
color printers to compete with Hewlett.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know her offer laundry lists of her positive
qualities. But many question whether her experience is broad enough
to run Xerox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anne is incredibly open and honest,'' said David A. Nadler,
chairman of Delta Consulting Group, which has done work for Xerox.
``But she's not a technologist, and she's never been heavily into
product development.''
</P>
<P>
   James W. Lundy, a research director at Gartner and a former
Xerox employee, said: ``She certainly has leadership and
motivational skills. But she's been at Xerox an awfully long time,
and that doesn't give her an outside perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   An outside perspective did not help Thoman much. ``We haven't
implemented strategies as well as we should have, and I think Rick
Thoman's being an outsider was part of the problem,'' Allaire said.
</P>
<P>
   Thoman agreed. ``It's hard when you come into a company with a
proud heritage and a long culture,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Mulcahy said: ``I know the Xerox team well. I know
how to get things done, and I clearly intend to stay focused on
flawless execution.''
</P>
<P>
   She may be inheriting a company on the mend. Jonathan
Rosenzweig, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, said, ``It's got
two new color copiers that will be gangbuster successes, and a
platform of digital copiers that are truly cost competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, Xerox announced an alliance with the Sharp Corp. and
with FujiXerox, a joint venture with Fuji Photo Film Co., to make
inexpensive ink jet printers. Last month, Xerox and Microsoft Corp.
said they would create a joint venture company, ContentGuard, to
produce and market software that protects copyrighted materials
like books, music and video distributed over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   First-quarter earnings were a pleasant surprise, too. The
company's income before previously announced charges fell to $220
million, or 30 cents a diluted share, compared with $343 million,
or 48 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. But analysts had
not expected it to top 25 cents a share. Revenue was up 3 percent,
to $4.43 billion, which many investors took as a sign that Xerox
was finally back in growth mode.

PLANNED BLAZE IS CLOSE COUSIN OF WILDFIRE

<P>
   The hard truth of fire management is that the conditions most
auspicious for a ``prescribed burn,'' in which dangerously dense
pine forests are purged of combustible debris, are not so very
different from those that can lead to a devastating wildfire. The
weather must be dry enough for brush, dead wood and thickets of
stunted pine trees to ignite, and there must be enough wind to
spread the flames.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never completely safe,'' said Dr. Wallace Covington, a
professor at Northern Arizona University's School of Forestry in
Flagstaff. ``You offer up a little prayer and hope for the best,
because the situation might get out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   If the fires are set in the spring, when conditions in the
Southwest are hot and dry, there is a danger of losing control of
the flames. But if the fires are set in the fall, when it is cooler
and wetter, temperature inversions may trap the smoke, choking
nearby residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the devil and the deep blue sea,'' Covington said. ``More
people die of emphysema and heart disease from smoke than are ever
killed from wildfires.''
</P>
<P>
   In the worst possible case, like the one that set off the fire
around Los Alamos, N.M., the wind and heat become too intense. The
flames leap into the forest canopy causing a raging ``crown fire''
that jumps from tree to tree. Tall dry pines, loaded with sap,
explode from the heat.
</P>
<P>
   To decide whether a planned fire ``meets the prescription,''
meaning that it is likely to remain under control, foresters plug a
list of factors into a computer model: the amount of wood and other
tinder in the forest, the moisture content of the fuels, the
relative humidity and temperature of the air, the speed of the
wind. They also refer to an esoteric gauge called the Haines index.
This factor takes into account the humidity on the ground and how
fast the temperature of the air cools as it is measured higher and
higher above the terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Everything is a tradeoff. Since heat rises, a high Haines index
may mean that flames, climbing the gradient of temperatures, will
leap to form a crown fire. But the vertical motion can also quickly
get rid of suffocating smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very difficult science,' said Dave Simon, Southwestern
director of the National Park Conservation Association, a nonprofit
group that monitors national parks and monuments. ``There should be
more prescribed fires going on in the national parks and forests,''
he said. ``It's absolutely essential that we inject fire back into
these ecosystems.''

 &HT;    United Methodists reject protesters' pleas to end stand against
homosexuality
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND, Ohio _ In a tumultuous meeting marked by
demonstrations, arrests and a near-tumble from a balcony, the
United Methodist General Conference voted Thursday to reaffirm its
stand against homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 1,000 delegates voted 2-1 to retain language in the
church's Book of Discipline that says ``homosexual practice is
incompatible with Christian teaching.'' By a similar ratio, they
voted to maintain prohibitions against the ordination of gays and
lesbians and the blessing of same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   During the votes, protesters stood silently on the floor, in
keeping with their agreement not to disrupt the conference.
</P>
<P>
   But afterward, they moved onto the dais behind presiding Bishop
Daniel Solomon of Baton Rouge, La., and began singing the civil
rights anthem ``We Shall Overcome.'' Among the demonstrators were
Bishop Susan Morrison of Albany, N.Y., Bishop Joseph Sprague of
Chicago and the Rev. Gregory Dell of Chicago. Dell has been
suspended from the ministry for blessing a same-sex union.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have decided as a group to nonviolently break the covenant
we have made with Bishop Solomon because we believe the church has
broken covenant with us,'' said Randy Miller, a spokesman for a
coalition of United Methodist organizations that support gay
rights.
</P>
<P>
   At that, Solomon put his head in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm burying my head in prayer,'' he said. ``I cannot witness
what is about to occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Police removed the demonstrators and charged them with
disrupting a lawful meeting, an offense that carries a maximum fine
of $250 or 30 days in jail, according to a police spokeswoman, Lt.
Sharon MacKay.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the meeting room, Joe Whittemore, the layman who heads
the North Georgia delegation and a veteran of two previous
quadrennial General Conferences, had tears in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made it clear and unequivocal that the homosexual
community is welcome in the United Methodist Church,'' he said.
``But that does not mean that we can change our doctrine and our
historical position about homosexual practice being incompatible
with Christian teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is taking any joy in this,'' said Tom Jackson of
Athens, Ga., who supported the bans on gay ordination and same-sex
unions. ``At some point, though, the church has to clearly express
its stand. It's sad any time there is a deep division in the body
of Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the debate, after losing the first key vote,
some demonstrators made their way onto the floor while others lined
the balcony. A delegate identified later as Jeanne Smile climbed to
the rail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am gay,'' she screamed, sobbing. ``I have been gay all my
life. I have tried to be what God wants me to be.''
</P>
<P>
   She teetered above the conference floor over the tables where
the North Georgia delegation sat.
</P>
<P>
   Whittemore and others below scurried to catch her in case she
fell. But uniformed security officers grasped the woman, put her
into a wheel chair, fitted her with an oxygen mask and took her
away to be examined by paramedics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was horrifying,'' said Kathryn Johnson, executive director
of the Methodist Federation for Social Action, whose 2,000 members
are part of a coalition supporting gay rights. ``I felt for her. I
think it captures her pain.''
</P>
<P>
   The clash over homosexuality resembled previous debates that
have taken place in United Methodist and other mainline Protestant
denominations for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those of us who believe that homosexuality is incompatible
with Christian teaching, this is not an issue on which we can
compromise,'' said the Rev. Roger Elliot of North Carolina. ``It
doesn't mean we are bigoted or homophobic or mean-spirited.''
</P>
<P>
   Edna Brubaker of Michigan, who said some members of her family
are gay, voiced a different view: ``God is a God who has spread the
table wide, and all have a place at that table.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Miller, a delegate from New Jersey, identified himself as a
gay man born into a family of Methodist ministers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be a handful of gay and lesbian delegates in here,''
he said, ``but the rest of you are heterosexual people making
decisions about us. . . . I encourage you to remember that this is
my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Creech of Raleigh, N.C., a former United Methodist
minister who lost his credentials for performing same-sex unions in
violation of church policy, said the day's work on the convention
floor was ``an extremely painful defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he said, ``it's a defeat for the moment, not for the
long term.''

TITANS' OWNER APOLOGIZES FOR GESTURE MEANT FOR EX-HOUSTON MAYOR &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID BARRON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In his zeal to take yet another swipe at old foe Bob
Lanier, Tennessee Titans owner Bud Adams waved his middle finger in
the air _ and promptly stuffed his foot in his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Adams sheathed his finger and extracted his tootsies long enough
Thursday to issue an apology to Lanier, the former Houston mayor
who was at the receiving end of Adams' off-color gesture Wednesday
in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Adams' blunder came at a news conference to unveil the Titans'
American Football Conference championship ring and 1999 highlight
video. The former Houston Oilers, who moved to Tennessee in 1996,
advanced to Super Bowl XXXIV in January but lost to the St. Louis
Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a moment of triumph, Adams couldn't forget his feud with
Lanier, whose opposition to a publicly financed stadium in Houston
prompted the team's move to Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Adams placed a prototype of the new championship ring on the
ring finger of his left hand. A ring from the Oilers' American
Football League championship days in the early 1960s was on the
ring finger of his right hand. He was asked where he would wear a
Super Bowl ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'll tell you, we're going to be there,'' he said.
``Someone said, `Where are you going to put that ring, the first
AFL championship and AFC championship ... where are they going to
put that next ring?'''
</P>
<P>
   Adams then held up his right hand and extended the middle
finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I'm going to put it right on this finger and say to
the mayor of Houston, ``There it is, Mayor, take a look at it,'''''
Adams said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   A clip of Adams' comments was shown on Nashville station WKRN,
which blurred the offending digit. It was fed to KTRK, Houston's
ABC affiliate, and to ESPN, which aired it Wednesday night and
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Adams issued an apology of sorts Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I apologize for my gesture yesterday, which was obviously done
in jest,'' Adams said in a statement. ``I should not have displayed
in public my personal feelings toward the former Houston mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future I will make sure I leave the past behind and
concentrate on the great organization and fans we have here in
Tennessee.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams left his Houston office Thursday afternoon for a speaking
engagement in Mississippi and was not available for further
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lanier, who was out of town on business, said through a
spokesman, ``I appreciate the apology.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said Adams would not be disciplined
for the gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Adams' gesture reveals the apparent depth of bitterness he feels
over his failure in 1994 to obtain Lanier's backing for a new NFL
stadium. Adams began talks in 1995 to move the team to Nashville,
and the Oilers played their last game in Houston in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   After playing in temporary homes in Memphis and Nashville, the
renamed Titans moved to Nashville's new Adelphia Coliseum and rode
a wave of upsets into the franchise's first Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Adams continues to live in Houston, where his role in the city's
pro football history has been largely forgotten in the excitement
over a new NFL franchise, owned by Bob McNair, that will begin play
in 2002 at a new stadium that will be built with public and private
funds. In 1994, Adams had been willing to put millions of his own
money into a Houston stadium as well.

ADMINISTRATION EXPLORES MAKING HANFORD REACH NATIONAL MONUMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Impatient at prolonged inaction by Congress, the
Clinton administration is moving toward designating the 51-mile,
undammed Hanford Reach of the Columbia River as a national
monument.
</P>
<P>
   The Hanford Reach is the last free-flowing stretch of the
Columbia River and home to the most productive salmon run remaining
in the United States outside Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt is tentatively scheduled to
visit the state Tuesday to explore ways to administratively protect
the stretch of river, said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot wait any longer,'' said Murray, a longtime sponsor
of legislation that would give protection to the Hanford Reach
under the U.S. Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have worked a long time to reach a legislative solution on
this,'' Murray said. ``At a time when our region faces tough
choices on salmon runs, the Hanford Reach is a no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten to a point where obstructionists were ready to
wait this out. ... If we are going to ask others to sacrifice for
salmon protection, the federal government must do its part first.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle over the Hanford Reach has raged for more than five
years in Congress, but no legislation has emerged from committee.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Murray nor an Interior Department spokeswoman would
confirm that national monument designation is a likely option. They
emphasized that Babbitt would come to discuss ``administrative
options'' for the Reach.
</P>
<P>
   However, President Clinton recently used his authority under the
1906 Antiquities Act to designate a 1.1 million acre national
monument in Arizona canyonlands adjoining Grand Canyon National
Park, and to protect 383,000 acres of giant sequoia trees in the
Sierra Nevada mountains of California.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many other official designations can the administration
bestow on the area? It appears that the Hanford Reach has finally
bubbled to the top of the list,'' said Bill Arthur, head of the
Sierra Club's Northwest office.
</P>
<P>
   Several of America's most famous national parks had their
initial protection as presidentially designated national monuments.
For instance, Theodore Roosevelt used his presidential authority to
protect the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   The Hanford Reach is the lone free-flowing stretch of the
Columbia River between Bonneville Dam and the Canadian border. It
is not a wilderness. Eight shut-down nuclear reactors sit along its
banks. But due to a half-century of weapons work at the Hanford
Nuclear Reservation, the Columbia River was never dammed there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the biggest spawning area for wild chinook salmon left
in the lower 48 states,'' said John DeYonge of the Washington
Environmental Council.
</P>
<P>
   The Reach is home to a major fall chinook salmon run. It is also
a transit area for salmon and steelhead moving upstream to the
Okanogan and Methow rivers. The upstream runs have been listed
under the Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   The Reach supports large flocks of birds, and is dotted with
islands on which numerous Indian artifacts have been found.
</P>
<P>
   The administration already has moved to protect slopes above the
Reach, which flows through the 560-square-mile Hanford Nuclear
Reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, President Clinton ordered that 57,000 acres
called the Wahluke Slope be managed as part of the Saddle Mountain
National Wildlife Refuge.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether a national monument would include only the
Columbia River and its immediate environs, or would also protect a
31-mile-long stretch of white bluffs above the river and the
wildlife habitat of the Wahluke Slope.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Doc Hastings, R-Wash., who represents central Washington,
has resisted legislation calling for wild and scenic river
designation for the Reach. Local county commissioners, agribusiness
interests and irrigation districts have also opposed federal
protection of the Hanford Reach.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings has introduced a rival bill that would set up a locally
dominated body to protect the river. It would turn large areas of
adjoining federal land over to management by four surrounding
counties. A portion of the now-protected Wahluke Slope would be
developed for agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   The office of Sen. Slade Gorton Thursday denounced the prospect
of unilateral Clinton administration action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reflects a total distrust of local communities' ability to
govern their own affairs,'' said Cynthia Bergman, Gorton's press
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Clinton-Gore administration goes into Eastern
Washington and takes over its backyard, this is only the tip of the
iceberg,'' she added. ``Under an Al Gore administration, we will
see more of the same.''

MAINE PASSES LAW DESIGNED TO REDUCE COST OF DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Maine Legislature gave final passage Thursday to a bill that
makes Maine the first state to threaten the pharmaceutical industry
with price controls, which could come into force in 2003, and in
the meantime effectively turns the state into a giant drug-price
negotiator for about half its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Angus King, an independent, signed the bill Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the industry can consolidate and increase its market power,
so can we,'' King said. ``We're going to bargain on behalf of 50
percent of our citizens and we think that they deserve the same
consideration as other groups that get discounts based on their
volume.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution to rising drug prices really belongs at the federal
level, King said, ``but in the meantime we've got some people up
here who need help.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill, a compromise, is less radical than the original
measure passed by the Legislature on April 11. That bill decreed
that if drug prices in Maine did not fall significantly by Oct. 1
of next year that a ``fair pricing'' commission would mandate that
all prescription drugs sold in the state cost no more than they did
in Canada, where drugs are generally less expensive.
</P>
<P>
   But Chellie Pingree, the Senate's Democratic majority leader and
the bill's sponsor, said the compromise measure was far more
legally defensible. The pharmaceutical industry is expected to
challenge the law in court. Pingree said the new version had the
state make a much more concerted effort to bring prices down
through voluntary measures before clamping on price controls.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate unanimously passed the bill Thursday before it
went back to the House, where it passed overwhelmingly.
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, a similar bill has passed both houses in different
forms and is under negotiation in a conference committee, with
price controls one of the sticking points.
</P>
<P>
   The pharmaceutical industry expressed displeasure with the new
Maine law. Alan F. Holmer, president of Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America, the trade association, said the law,
``gives a `go-away' signal to innovators, including Maine's
promising biotechnology industry and will depress the climate for
investment in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   With passage of the bill, Holmer said, ``Maine has become the
most anti-business state in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   King called the accusation ``utter nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   In a state of about 1 million people, the bill will create the
Maine Rx program that will negotiate prescription drug prices for
the estimated 325,000 who are uninsured or have insurance that does
not cover prescriptions as well as 200,000 people in Medicaid and
prescription drug programs for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also imposes ``profiteering'' penalties of up to
$100,000 per action on manufacturers or distributors who are
considered to be charging excessive prices for drugs or restricting
the state's supplies. It creates a 12-member commission to review
drug prices and access, and provides for an extra $3 fee to
pharmacies for every prescription they fill in the Maine Rx
program.
</P>
<P>
   If the commission determines as of Jan. 5, 2003, that the price
of drugs purchased in the Maine Rx program are not reasonably
comparable with the lowest drug prices paid by patients with
discounts like those offered veterans, then the state can begin
imposing price limits requiring such discounts as of July 1, 2003.

GALAXY EXPECTS LEAGUE OK ON HERNANDEZ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Major League Soccer is expected to announce
today that Luis Hernandez, Mexico's talented and colorful striker,
is a member of the Los Angeles Galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   According to Galaxy officials, MLS executives had hoped to
announce the deal Thursday but weren't able to finalize all the
details of the transfer agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez will not be available for Saturday's game at Dallas,
but he is expected to play in Wednesday's game at San Jose. That
game will pit Hernandez against the Earthquakes and another new
Mexican import, Jose Manuel Abundis, who is expected to be
allocated to the Earthquakes from Toluca of the Mexican first
division.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a huge addition for us,'' said Galaxy coach Sigi
Schmid. ``You're talking about a proven scorer for Mexico on a
consistent basis. He'll give us that extra dimension to go with
Cobi (Jones).''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid might not like what L.A. has to give up to acquire
Hernandez _ three starters _ but he realizes Hernandez brings a
special quality. Hernandez scored 12 goals for Tigres this season
and had four goals in four World Cup matches for Mexico in 1998 in
France.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win championships, you need special players, and he's a
special player,'' said Schmid. ``Hernandez sets a tone for where
this franchise is heading. He goes hand-in-hand with talks of our
new stadium. He'll be special to the people of this city.''
</P>
<P>
   Striker Clint Mathis, defender Joey Franchino and midfielder Roy
Myers are all casualties of the Hernandez allocation. To clear
salary cap space, MLS asked the Galaxy to make three players
available for a ``dispersal draft'' so that New York/New Jersey and
New England, the teams with the worst records in the league the
past two seasons, could acquire Mathis and Franchino for nothing to
improve their rosters.
</P>
<P>
   Unless either team changes its mind, the MetroStars will select
Mathis and New England will select Franchino.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mathis is available, we will pick him,'' said MetroStars
general manager Nick Sakiewicz.
</P>
<P>
   There is speculation, however, that Franchino will be traded
from New England to San Jose in time for the Galaxy's game
Wednesday against the Earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Mathis nor Franchino was at the Galaxy's practice
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Since Hernandez will not be available for Saturday's game in
Dallas, Schmid said Myers will be allowed to travel and play with
the Galaxy against the Burn.
</P>
<P>
   It has not been announced where Myers will be sent, but the 31-
year-old midfielder told a Spanish-language publication that he
would go to New York/New Jersey, where he and Mathis will be
reunited with former Galaxy coach Octavio Zambrano.
</P>
<P>
   While Schmid and other Galaxy officials are upset they had to
give up so much to acquire Hernandez, Zambrano said he doesn't feel
sorry for L.A. But the MetroStars coach said he understands the
team's complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone on my end is going to say it's fair, and anyone on
their end is going to say it's not fair,'' said Zambrano. ``I was
on the top end of it with the Galaxy, when it seemed like nothing
was fair and you couldn't get anything. But I can tell you from the
other end, this is something our team needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Hernandez will not slow the Galaxy down, Zambrano said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luis Hernandez, I will say right now, is in the same league as
Jaime Moreno and Marco Etcheverry,'' said Zambrano. ``He's the type
of player that can win a championship for you. There is no way, no
way anyone can tell me this deal hurts their team. I won't buy
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The focus now turns to the Galaxy's depth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my job as a coach,'' said Schmid. ``We have young guys
like Peter Vagenas, Danny Califf and Adam Frye; we need these types
of players to step up.''

DOCTORS WILL TRY TO REVERSE PROCESS THAT CAUSES JUVENILE DIABETES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The first attempt to harness the immune system to
prevent a disease that affects 1 million people nationwide is
likely to get under way in Seattle this summer when doctors try to
turn off the process that causes juvenile diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major shift in approach,'' said Dr. Gerry Nepom,
director of the Virginia Mason Research Center in Seattle whose
work led to the new approach.
</P>
<P>
   The diabetes trial would test two different immune system
molecules to try to prevent the disease that occurs when the body's
immune system attacks itself, turning on islet cells in the
pancreas and destroying their ability to make insulin. Because the
body requires insulin to regulate blood sugar levels, patients rely
on daily injections of insulin for the rest of their lives.
Serious, sometimes fatal, complications can occur.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers, comprising a new consortium of immunologists, met
in Seattle Thursday night to review the clinical trial protocol.
Once approved, the trial would enroll a total of 60 patients with
newly diagnosed juvenile diabetes in two age groups _ 7 to 14, and
14 to 25. The trial would take place at multiple centers, including
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Consortium members had their inaugural meeting just prior to the
kickoff of the American Association of Immunologists meeting, which
runs through Tuesday in Seattle. The AAI meeting, the world's
largest gathering of immunologists, will bring more than 4,000
immunology researchers to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium, called the Tolerance Network, includes about 15
research sites, and recently received $170 million in startup
funding from the National Institutes of Health, the Department of
Energy and the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation. The aim is to speed
the discovery of new treatments for autoimmune and other
immunological disorders by coordinating trial protocols and sharing
data.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Virginia Mason, four other research centers are
involved in recruiting and testing patients for the diabetes trial.
</P>
<P>
   At the time juvenile diabetes is usually diagnosed, patients
have already lost 80 to 90 percent of their islet cells and will
eventually lose them all.
</P>
<P>
   If the new treatment works, doctors hope they can prevent the
loss of the final cells. More importantly subsequent trials would
look at intervening earlier, eventually saving enough cells to
prevent patients from relying on daily injections of insulin.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is controllable, diabetes can lead to serious
complications, including blindness, kidney failure and circulatory
problems. Juvenile diabetes affects about 0.4 percent of the U.S.
population, and is the second largest autoimmune disorder in the
country, after rheumatoid arthritis, which affects about 1 percent
of the population.
</P>
<P>
   The diabetes work symbolizes a new era in the understanding and
treatment of autoimmune disease.
</P>
<P>
   Autoimmune disorders comprise about 50 diseases that attack
various parts of the body. Rheumatoid arthritis, for example,
causes painful, debilitating joint inflammation while scleroderma
causes a disabling hardening of connective tissue. Taken together,
autoimmune disorders affect about 5 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Although researchers don't fully understand what triggers the
diseases, they suspect some combination of environmental and
genetic factors causes the body to turn on itself.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, all these diseases were treated differently, said
Nepom, who was one of the first researchers to discover that
juvenile diabetes is a form of autoimmune disease.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, scientists have discovered that despite the
wide variety of symptoms and effects, most autoimmune diseases
ultimately involve malfunctioning in some common immune system
pathways.
</P>
<P>
   The only other trial to try to prevent juvenile diabetes was in
Europe in the mid-1980s when scientists tried to use cyclosporine,
a powerful immune suppressant, to halt the disease. But the drug,
which can have toxic side effects, caused kidney failure and the
trial failed.
</P>
<P>
   In the last several years, scientists have discovered a host of
immune system molecules, called cytokines and chemokines, that tell
cells in the immune system what to do and direct them where to go
in the body. Researchers are now on the verge of understanding how
to use these immune system molecules to modify, or even reverse,
autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus,
sceleroderma or Crohn's disease, an inflammatory disease of the
small intestine. Such an approach could be a vast improvement over
the ``brute force'' use of powerful immune suppressants, such as
steroids or chemotherapy drugs, which can have debilitating side
effects, Nepom said.
</P>
<P>
   The common denominator is that T-cells, the body's main attack
cells for protecting it against foreign invaders, get turned on, he
said. But instead of warding off pathogens, such as bacteria or
viruses, the cells mistakenly attack normal tissue and cells in the
body.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile diabetes
couldn't be more different, he said. ``You have joints versus
pancreas, kids versus adults. There are zillions of differences.
But in terms of the mechanism at the cellular level, they are very
similar.''
</P>
<P>
   If scientists can intervene to turn off or stop the spread of
T-cells at the cellular level, they could well change the course of
the disease, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Being able to use those immune cells could also have
implications for fighting infections, and for preventing rejection
of transplanted organs and tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is you can develop common therapies that (could
be) good for everything,'' he said. ``What we learn from one
disease, we can apply to others.''

RILEY WILL ONLY SETTLE FOR TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM HADDOCK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It didn't take long for Ricky Riley to get the hang of racing in
the Tri-State Mini Stock division. In only his second start on the
series, the Lancaster driver put his Hal Racing-sponsored car in
victory lane at Irwindale (Calif.) Speedway Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, Riley jumped to 11th in points and fourth in
the rookie standings. But he has higher goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pretty much expect to win this thing this year,'' said the
38-year-old Riley.
</P>
<P>
   He had the fastest car in qualifying and started the race from
the sixth spot in an inverted grid. He took the lead in lap 15 of
the 20-lap feature on the three-mile oval and led for the race's
final five laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car was handling good all day long,'' Riley said. ``We
were pretty blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tri-State Mini Stock class races at the Orange Show Speedway
in San Bernardino, El Cajon Speedway and Irwindale Speedway.
Saturday night was the first visit the mini stocks made to
Irwindale this season.
</P>
<P>
   The mini stock cars are half-scale replicas of NASCAR Winston
Cup-type cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to climb in through the roof of these things and lay
down in them,'' Riley said. The mini stocks can reach speeds of
between 70 and 80 mph. ``They're right there with the pro stocks.
They're pretty exciting little cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley, who grew up near Chico in Northern California, started
his racing career at Saugus Speedway in the Outlaw Mini Stock
class. He eventually moved up to pro stocks and raced in a
Sportsman class when he lived in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The next race on the Tri-State Mini Stock series is at El Cajon
Speedway Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   In other action at Irwindale Speedway, Kevin Vernon of
Bakersfield won the NASCAR Super Late Model feature, James Weston
of Goleta won the NASCAR Late Models feature, Ron Peterson won the
Mechanix Wear Speed Truck feature and Bob Reed of Riverside won the
NASCAR Mini Stock feature.
</P>
<P>
   __ Long way back: Saugus driver Sean Woodside nearly had the
comeback story of the year on the NASCAR Featherlite Southwest
Series. He rallied from 21st to battle Auggie Vidovich for the
checkered flag in the Patrick's Carpets/E.R. Carpenter 125 at
Tucson Raceway Park. Vidovich won by just .10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the way the day went, we were happy with second,''
Woodside said. ``We had to take a provisional and work all the way
up front.''
</P>
<P>
   With his second-place showing, Woodside, who won the Southwest
Series race at Mesa Marin Raceway in Bakersfield in March, moved
into third in series points. Doug McCoun leads the series with 594,
four points ahead of Jim Inglebright and 17 ahead of Woodside.
Vidovich, who has led the most laps this season with 209, is
seventh in points.
</P>
<P>
   Granada Hills driver M.K. Kanke set a record at Tucson. He won
the pole with a time of 14.985 seconds (90.090 mph). It was the
22nd pole of his career, the most of any driver on the series.
</P>
<P>
   The next event on the Southwest Series is the Sunstate Equipment
Company 100 on May 21 at Pikes Peak International Raceway in
Colorado Springs, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   __ First sprint title: Cory Kruseman of Ventura won his first
race of the season on the Sprint Car Racing Association series at
Perris Auto Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Kruseman, 11th in series points, held off a surging Richard
Griffin of Silver City, N.M., en route to his first SCRA win of
2000.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rookie race heats up: Ron Hornaday Jr. can see Kevin Harvick
in his rear-view mirror. The NASCAR Busch Grand National Series
driver from Palmdale is only nine points ahead of Harvick in the
series rookie points race.
</P>
<P>
   As they head to New Hampshire International Speedway for the
Busch Series 200 on Saturday, Hornaday can go with the comfort of
knowing that the track has been kind to him in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Hornaday won a NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series there in 1996.
That's good news for a driver coming off a 17th-place finish under
the lights for the Hardee's 250 on May 5 at Richmond International
Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire has been a track that has been very good to us
in the past, but it has bitten us as well,'' Hornaday said. ``We
won here in the truck and thought we had a good chance last year
until I got shoved into the turn two wall and tore up my NAPA
Chevy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I can get a feel for the track early because that has
been the hardest adjustment I have faced this year. The Busch cars
are just so different from the trucks. I think this track will
probably seem completely different to me.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hornaday is looking for his groove that produced two
top-five finishes early this season, Harvick seems to have found
his.
</P>
<P>
   The Bakersfield driver turned in a third-place showing at
Richmond, where Jeff Green won for the first time this season.

IN JAIL CELL INTERVIEW, FINANCIER CLAIMS INNOCENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The man accused of masterminding the largest insurance fraud in
American history, Martin R. Frankel, now insists his complex
financial dealings were a legitimate effort to feed the world's
hungry.
</P>
<P>
   In his first interview since his capture eight months ago in
Germany, Frankel portrayed himself as a victim, saying he had been
brought low by a charitable nature and a tendency to trust others
too much. ``Probably the main reason that I'm here,'' he said, from
inside the Hamburg jail where he is being held, ``is that I love
people too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have charged him with bilking insurance companies of
more than $200 million in a scheme they say involved several
priests, a high Vatican judge and a phony charity.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel was interviewed in Germany this week by Brian Ross,
chief investigative correspondent for ABC News. A videotape of the
interview, scheduled to be shown Friday night on ``20/20,'' was
made available to The New York Times under a collaborative
agreement between the news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Frankel never directly denied the charges
against him, which include fraud, money laundering, conspiracy and
racketeering.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said that a life sentence, which he faces, would
violate ``human dignity and human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on camera with a scraggly beard and silver-rimmed
glasses askew, the 45-year-old former stockbroker offered a defiant
case for leniency, saying that his supposed crimes were only
financial. ``There is no violence. No one is murdered. No one is
killed. No one is physically harmed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. prosecutors say that Frankel built an elaborate criminal
empire using a financial trust, a brokerage house and a Catholic
charity with links to the Vatican as fronts to buy small Southern
insurance companies, which he then drained of more than $200
million in assets. From his Greenwich, Conn., mansion, he used the
money to buy luxury cars, fur coats for his girlfriends, and
eventually $16 million in diamonds and gold to finance his flight
through Europe, according to a 36-count indictment issued last
October by the U.S. attorney's office in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   While Frankel declined to discuss the specific charges against
him during the interview, his remarks offer a curious psychological
portrait of an alternately grandiose, glib and self-pitying figure.
``I wish that I didn't have this incredible ability to predict
things in the markets,'' he said, ``because then I never would have
gotten into this position.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 35-minute interview, Frankel said that his goal was never
to get rich but to ``feed all the hungry people in the world;
that's the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Or at least, try to,'' he continued. ``That was my goal of my
whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he granted the interview because he wanted to make the
case that it was against German law for him to be extradited.
``Under German law,'' he said, ``no human being arrested in Germany
can be sent back to a country where they will either execute him,
or put him in jail for the rest of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his German lawyers, Dirk Meinicke, when reached by phone
in Hamburg, said of Frankel's statement, ``It's his opinion.'' He
added that Frankel spoke with ABC against Meinicke's advice.
</P>
<P>
   A high state court in Hamburg has approved Frankel's
extradition, but Frankel must first stand trial next month on
charges of passport fraud and customs-tax evasion. Frankel had nine
false passports with him and a cache of diamonds when he was
arrested Sept. 4 at a luxury hotel in Hamburg.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office, Delcie Thiebault,
said Thursday that she would not comment on Frankel's remarks but
that the process of extradition was ``under way.''
</P>
<P>
   Conditions in the Untersuchungshaften Jail, where Frankel spends
his days alone in a cell, wearing the same blue shirt and khakis in
which he was arrested, are far from the conspicuous luxury of his
past life.
</P>
<P>
   For six years, he ran a stock-trading business from his mansion,
hiring submissive female companions to do office work, indulge his
taste for sado-masochistic sex, and bait potential business
partners.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel said, however, that he was loyal and loving to these
women, and supported them financially even after he stopped dating
them. ``I wanted a woman who loved me, who respected me, who wanted
to stand by me and stick with me and be with me forever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His scheme soon collapsed under its own weight, according to
legal documents and a diary that he maintained in the margins of a
1999 astrology guide that was turned over by a travel companion to
the FBI. The diary documents how state regulators from Mississippi
and Tennessee grew suspicious, asking to see how he had invested
the premiums from various insurance companies. He also notes death
threats and attempts at blackmail by various colleagues alongside
notes about bizarre sexual acts, scheduled haircuts and visits to
his mother in Toledo, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   To persuade Mississippi regulators of his solvency, he had a
now-retired member of the Vatican Supreme Tribunal sign a false
affidavit saying that Frankel had $1 billion in Vatican money in
the Catholic charity that he created and controlled, the St.
Francis of Assisi Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   In his interview with ABC, Frankel insisted that ``never in a
million, never in a billion years,'' was this charity a cover for
criminal activity. He said ``The most hungry people we fed. Yes, we
fed some of the most hungry people in the world.'' He declined,
however, to specify how much money was in the charity, or how it
operated.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, after failing to appease state regulators, Frankel
fled the country, leaving documents ablaze in his mansion. From the
debris, police officers recovered a ``to do'' list, in which
``launder money'' was prominently listed.
</P>
<P>
   During the last eight months _ while he has struggled in jail
with dental problems and tried, unsuccessfully, to get kosher food,
according to his lawyers _ his legal troubles have only deepened.
At least three of his former associates have cooperated with
federal prosecutors, providing information about Frankel's
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a financial genius,'' he said, laughing and shaking
his head during the ABC interview. ``If a financial genius would
end up in here, then they're not a genius by definition.''

 &HT;    OK, I'll think `happy' - but I won't like it!
 &HT;    By The Practical Man
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ This week, the practical man has a promise to
keep.
</P>
<P>
   Be happy.
</P>
<P>
   It happened during a conversation with a reader. This woman,
peeved by his proclamation that males befriend only attractive
females, lingered at length over three pungent points: The
practical man is a) an insensitive idiot, b) an arrogant idiot and
c) merely an idiot.
</P>
<P>
   Then she got personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your whole column stinks, Practical Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Does not!
</P>
<P>
   ``All you ever do is gripe, gripe, gripe.''
</P>
<P>
   Nuh-uh!
</P>
<P>
   ``Would it kill you to say something nice? Doesn't anything make
you happy?''
</P>
<P>
   ``People who know when to shut up'' came to mind, but the
practical man held his tongue. Instead, wearied by his whupping and
desperate to drive her away, he made a fatal vow: This week he
would criticize no one, make no smart remarks and write only about
stuff he likes. It was heavy lifting, but here he goes _
gripe-free.
</P>
<P>
   THREE THINGS THAT MAKE THE PRACTICAL MAN HAPPY
</P>
<P>
   Quilting: No, the practical man doesn't make quilts, but he does
admire skill and he knows it was happiness he felt when he sat on a
porch in the mountains of North Carolina and watched somebody's
grandma work wonders with needle and thread. He bought one _ not
because he needed it, but because her expertise made him feel good
and he wanted to keep the idea of it around.
</P>
<P>
   Similar things also make the practical man happy: Hearing Pat
Metheny play guitar, watching a cabinetmaker fit a dovetail joint,
remembering how his old man _ a lifelong grocer _ could add prices
in his head faster than you could punch them into the register. The
skills smart people can develop over a lifetime of dedication are
truly inspiring, and they inevitably make the practical man smile.
</P>
<P>
   Of course _ and the practical man swears he's not going to gripe
here, but just gently point out a valuable truth _ to appreciate
those skills, you have to invest some effort of your own. A
dovetail joint fails to impress if you've never tried to make one
yourself. A mathematician's manipulations are a mystery to those
who use calculators to balance their checkbooks. And Metheny's
might means nothing to music ``lovers'' who don't know rhythm from
blues, or an E string from a G string. Your chances for happiness
are higher if you spend more time doing things yourself _ even if
you do them poorly _ and less time watching others perform.
</P>
<P>
   The Amish: Sure, the practical man has some religious issues to
work out here, and he's not sold on the eighth-grade education
limit, but you've got to give one thing to the Amish: They don't
need squat _ no malls, no TVs, no SUVs, no nothing that they can't
make or grow or build themselves, and by God, they can make and
grow and build some grade-A stuff.
</P>
<P>
   So while the practical man slaves away on the old Work Boring
Job/Buy Crap You Don't Need treadmill we've all chained ourselves
to, it gives him hope and makes him happy to think there are people
around with the brains and the balls to say screw it, to mean it
and to stick to it.
</P>
<P>
   Pounding nails: The practical man is happiest when he's working,
and he loves work of all kinds _ even the pantywaist keyboard
pecking he's doing right now. But while brain work has its
satisfactions, nothing is more rewarding than work that requires
sweat as well as smarts. Thus, the practical man's favorite jobs
are carpentry, construction, auto mechanics and the like, which can
wear him out in both body and mind, plus produce useful results.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the practical man might make a career of one of these
occupations if they didn't pay so poorly. But in our society, jobs
that require hard work and procure immediate, valuable results are
considered menial and go unrewarded. Instead, venture capitalists,
stockbrokers, bankers, athletes, talk-show hosts and other
parasites who produce nothing are the ones who get rich, while the
folks who build the country and keep it running and feed our
families get diddly.
</P>
<P>
   And that's definitely not griping. That's just the facts.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Practical Man: My 8-year-old daughter keeps pulling the old
``I can't go to school because I'm sick'' routine. Except it's
really the old ``I can't go to school because I want to play
Barbies and watch TV'' routine. I've tried to explain to her that
lying is bad, but it's not getting through. Any practical advice?
And please, don't suggest spanking. I'm not that kind of mom.
</P>
<P>
   It's old-fashioned, but you can still teach a lying child to
stop _ with Aesop. You just have to up the stakes in those
farmer-dude fables to make an impression on TV-tainted tots.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the practical man once solved your parental puzzler by
reciting a special version of ``The Boy Who Cried Wolf'' to one of
his kids. The punchline went something like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``And this time, when the shepherd boy hollered, no one came to
help him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did the wolf get his sheeps?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yep. And then the wolf got him _ ripped him up, dipped him in
ketchup, gobbled him down, howled at the moon and drug the boy's
shepherd stick back to his cave so the baby wolves could sharpen
their teeth on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Who cares if that last part isn't in the fable? Aesop never had
to go to bat against Barbie and ``Rugrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Practical Man: The other day I got cut off in traffic _
again! It really ticked me off, so I cursed the dude out and gave
him the finger like any red-blooded American driver should. But
then the guy slammed on his brakes in front of me, got behind me,
tailgated me, ran up beside me like he was going to run me off the
road and generally terrorized me for about 10 miles down I-95. I
was scared to death. How would the practical man have handled this
situation?
</P>
<P>
   Well, the next time you get cut off, instead of shouting the
same lame old cuss words, you could try swearing in Japanese, or
maybe Elizabethan style: ``Thou prating clapper-clawed manikin!
Thou villainous rough-hewn hempseed! Thou warped shag-eared
varlot!''
</P>
<P>
   The practical man learned these handy slams at The Elizabethan
Curse Generator (www.tower.org/insult/insult.html), and he thinks
they're a brilliant stroke. They get the anger off your chest but
expose you to no danger, for the other driver won't know what
you're talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Your other option is to learn to control your emotions and keep
your mouth shut, but we wouldn't want to go that far, would we?

WHITE SUPREMACIST AGREES TO TELEVISED APOLOGY
</HEADLINE>
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a settlement that entailed as much public
humiliation as punitive fines, the Department of Housing and Urban
Development on Thursday announced that a Pennsylvania white
supremacist must make a public apology to a woman he acknowledged
harassing and must help promote anti-discrimination efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Under the unusual settlement of a civil suit, Roy E.
Frankhouser, a self-described ``chaplain'' to the Ku Klux Klan, has
agreed to issue a televised apology to his victim, Bonnie L.
Jouhari, a former social worker who helped people file housing
discrimination complaints in Reading, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   And not on just any television show. To apply added force to the
punishment, Frankhouser must read the apology aloud on ``White
Forum,'' the public access show he hosts on the local cable system.
He must also submit copies of his apology to Jouhari, who is white,
to be published in the local newspaper and The Philadelphia
Inquirer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Frankhouser must broadcast public service
announcements informing the public about laws against
discrimination in housing, at the end of the show _ or any other
show he hosts _ for three years.
</P>
<P>
   He also must display _ on the front of his house, so that it is
visible to people on the street _ a poster supplied by HUD that
opposes bias in the sale or rental of housing. And he must attend
HUD-approved sensitivity sessions and perform 1,000 hours of
community service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this settlement makes a very loud statement, not just
to this particular case, but to anyone who would think of engaging
or involving themselves in this hideous type of behavior,'' HUD
Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo said.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement ends a case that began in 1997, when Frankhouser
reportedly began his campaign of harassment against Jouhari and her
daughter, Pilar Danielle Horton, who was in high school at the
time. At that time Jouhari had filed a complaint with the police
department accusing Frankhouser of possession of automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Jouhari said, the burley Frankhouser began sitting
on a public bench just outside her office and taking photographs of
her through the front window. He also broadcast pictures on his
show of Jouhari that were taken from the Web site of another white
supremacist, including a computer-generated video of an explosion
destroying Jouhari's office.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, Jouhari said, she and her daughter began
receiving threatening telephone calls and in 1998, Jouhari found a
flier placed on her car reading, ``Race Traitor Beware.''
</P>
<P>
   Jouhari said she first tried to persuade local and federal law
authorities to pursue criminal charges against Frankhouser, who is
a member of the United Klans of America and who, according to HUD
officials, had been arrested at least 142 times. But the local
police and the Justice Department reportedly declined to file
criminal charges, citing Frankhouser's First Amendment rights.
</P>
<P>
   Jouhari said in an interview that the harassment caused her to
fear for her life and to flee with her daughter, first to a nearby
town in Pennsylvania and later to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to leave my job, my home, my career, take my child away
from everything that she knew because they elected not to enforce
the law,'' said Jouhari, who no longer lives in Seattle, but would
not identify her current residence.
</P>
<P>
   With the Justice Department reluctant to pursue a criminal case,
HUD opted to file a civil case.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement announced on Thursday also required Frankhouser
to refrain from mentioning Jouhari or her daughter _ except to
apologize _ in any public forum for the rest of his life. He must
also stay at least 100 feet away from Jouhari and her daughter for
the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, for the next 10 years he must pay 5 percent of his
total salary to Jouhari and 5 percent to her daughter in any year
that he earns at least $25,000.

GOP WILL SCRUTINIZE CLINTON'S NATIONAL SECURITY POLICIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Speaker Dennis Hastert and the Senate
majority leader, Trent Lott, agreed on Thursday to create a
national security advisory panel of senior Republican experts in an
effort to give more credibility to congressional scrutiny and
criticism of President Clinton's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of the panel, which is to be announced next week,
coincides with growing alarm and distrust among many Republicans on
Capitol Hill over crucial decisions Clinton will make in the coming
weeks on missile defenses, nuclear arms reductions with Russia and
other national security issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a growing concern that we need to really monitor
events on how our national security is safeguarded,'' said Lott's
spokesman, John Czwartacki.
</P>
<P>
   Lott and Hastert, who met privately Thursday on a number of
issues, are forming the panel with the knowledge and implicit
blessing of top aides to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the
presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Indeed, the panel is
likely to be stocked in part with experts who are advising Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional aides said the panel of perhaps two dozen members
would include former secretaries of defense and state, and other
experts.
</P>
<P>
   Among those mentioned as leading candidates are Donald H.
Rumsfeld, a former secretary of defense, and R. James Woolsey, a
former director of central intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   The advisers would meet periodically to advise Lott and Hastert
on national security issues. Their first task is likely to be
counseling Republican leaders on Clinton's coming meeting in Moscow
with President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very qualified pool of experts who hold positions of
expertise that fall outside current government channels,''
Czwartacki said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to establish a brain trust that can encompass all
this talent and inform the opinions and decisions made by the
leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   One senior House Republican aide said the group would be asked
to submit reports on various issues to the Republican leadership
with a final, wide-ranging report due in July, possibly for use by
the speaker and majority leader on the campaign trail over the
summer recess in August.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate already have committees intended to provide
Lott and Hastert with the kind of advice and guidance they now
seemingly feel they need from a distinguished group of outside
experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sense we needed to have people involved with the
arms control issues to really provide counsel on a lot of important
decisions,'' said a top House Republican aide.

ESTIMATE OF TOXIC CHEMICAL EMISSIONS IS TRIPLED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, N.J.)  By WINNIE HU   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N. Y. _ The first national accounting of toxic chemical
emissions by electric power plants and the mining industry has
tripled the estimated volume of those releases.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which was compiled by the federal Environmental
Protection Agency, showed that in 1998 7.3 billion pounds of toxic
chemicals were reported released by eight industries including coal
mining, chemical wholesalers and petroleum terminals.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental agency said metal mining accounted for nearly
half of all discharges and that power plants released 1.1 billion
pounds of toxic chemicals in 1998, or about 15 percent of the
total. The previous year's report, which covered just
manufacturing, showed 2.7 billion pounds of toxic emissions.
</P>
<P>
   The report offers the first statistical look at not only the
volume of nationwide toxic chemical pollution but also the
extensive pollution that has become of particular concern in New
York and other Eastern states downwind of the nation's oldest and
dirtiest coal-burning power plants in the Midwest and South.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans now will have the best picture ever of the actual
amounts of toxic pollution being emitted by industry into local
communities,'' said Carol Browner, administrator of the
environmental protection agency, as she made the report public
Thursday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The new data reflect releases in 1998 and agency officials urged
that the information be used as a guide but not an indicator of
health risk because the report provides no information on exposure.
</P>
<P>
   New York officials and environmentalists said Thursday that the
agency's findings would aid their efforts to fight a growing
pollution problem. State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer has already
sued the owners of 12 coal-fired plants in the Midwest, asserting
that they did not install federally required pollution controls and
discharged vastly more toxic chemicals than they would have
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not news that they're polluting, but it is news to the
extent that they are polluting,'' said John F. Sheehan, a spokesman
for the Adirondack Council, an environmental group that is working
to protect the state's wilderness from acid rain and other
pollution. ``In many cases, people will suddenly find that the
power company has become the biggest polluter in their community.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, New York and other Eastern states have mainly
attempted to reduce the levels of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen
oxides that are produced heavily by coal-burning plants. But the
agency's report Thursday drew attention to 641 other toxic
chemicals emitted by industries into the air, water and ground.
</P>
<P>
   The 1.1 billion pounds of toxic emissions released by the power
plants included 536 millions pounds of hydrochloric acid, 180
million pounds of barium compounds and 169 million pounds of
sulfuric acid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all that pollution ends up in New York, but because of the
prevailing winds, much of it does,'' said Peter Lehner, chief of
the environmental protection bureau in Spitzer's office.
</P>
<P>
   The heaviest polluters were the 27 power plants in Ohio, which
emitted 113.9 million pounds of toxic chemicals in 1998. In
comparison, the 34 power plants in New York released 18.7 million
pounds of toxic emissions, and the 15 power plants in New Jersey
released 8 million pounds.

 &HT;    Elian's fate in hands of 3 judges
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A federal appeals court panel will decide ``in a few
weeks'' whether 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez returns to Cuba with his
father or gets the political asylum hearing his Miami relatives
desire.
</P>
<P>
   During a hearing lasting an hour and fifteen minutes, three
judges of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals hammered away with
questions from all sides of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The judges reminded attorneys that Elian's father wants to
return his son to a totalitarian state and wondered aloud what kind
of precedent they would be setting if they don't allow that to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   And through it all, the jurists gave little indication of how
they will decide the contentious dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The case, watched by the world, was argued before a packed
courtroom inside the Elbert Parr Tuttle Courthouse on Forsyth
Street in downtown Atlanta. As lawyers pressed their cause inside,
chants could be heard from dozens of sidewalk demonstrators
outside.
</P>
<P>
   If the court determines that U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno
correctly dismissed the boy's application for political asylum,
Elian and his father could return to Cuba soon afterward, legal
scholars predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Before the hearing, Judge J.L. Edmondson told spectators the
case is on a fast track, predicting a ruling in ``a few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   During the arguments, Edmondson noted that the State Department
calls Cuba ``a Communist, totalitarian state which regularly
violates the freedoms and rights of its citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   He also pointed out that U.S. law provides for a ``wide
variety'' of relatives to come into court and speak on behalf of a
child, against the parent's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   The case argued Thursday has been building since Elian was
rescued Thanksgiving Day, clinging for his life on an innertube in
the Atlantic. His mother died in their attempt to flee Cuba with
about a dozen others in a boat that sank off the coast of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Washington lawyer Gregory Craig, who represents Elian's father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, told the court he was not there to argue the
intricacies of immigration law.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, the attorney said, ``knows this boy better than anyone
in this courtroom or anyone on the face of this planet. Juan
Miguel's concern about his well-being, about his happiness and
about his future take second place to no one.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Joel Dubina said he had no reason to believe that Gonzalez
was anything but a loving parent, but questioned why it took him
five months to leave Cuba and see Elian. Lawyer Kendall Coffey, who
represents Elian's Miami relatives, urged the court to grant the
boy an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   He reminded the judges that Elian's late mother is considered a
traitor in Cuba. ``This child is going to be purged of illegal
thoughts in a communist country,'' Coffey said. ``He is a
traumatized child. That kind of purging is potentially of grave and
serious harm.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez and cousin Marisleysis
Gonzalez sat side by side in the second row of the courtroom.
Neither Elian nor his father attended the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The court may have to decide who is best qualified to speak on
Elian's behalf _ his father or great-uncle _ and whether the
6-year-old was competent to file his own asylum claim.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Charles Wilson, appointed to the court by President
Clinton, wondered what precedent would be set if the court decides
federal authorities do not have the discretion to dismiss the boy's
application for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say a teenage baby-sitter for a 2-year-old alien . . .
takes that child downtown to the INS (Immigration and
Naturalization Service) office while his parents are at the movies
and has him scribble his first name on an asylum application,''
Wilson speculated.
</P>
<P>
   The child's parents come running to the INS office screaming in
protest that they, not the baby-sitter, speak for their child, the
judge continued. ``You're telling me that the INS doesn't have any
discretion whatsoever, they have to go through the time and expense
of having a formal asylum hearing?''
</P>
<P>
   If the form is ``facially sufficient,'' INS regulations call for
a hearing, Coffey replied. And if the immigration agency believes
there is a ``baby-sitter problem,'' it should address the matter in
its own regulations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Would the INS's hands be tied if a kidnapper with a criminal
record brings it a 6-month-old child? Wilson asked. Would they have
``to go through the time and expense of an asylum hearing?''
</P>
<P>
   Coffey responded the INS might be able to reject that
application.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, there is some discretion on the part of the INS then,''
Wilson quickly interjected.
</P>
<P>
   But Coffey shot back that the judge's hypothetical proposition
was different from the case being argued. In Elian's case, the
court must assume that the boy wants to stay in the United States
and in such instances hearings are always provided. Wilson
expressed skepticism as to whether Elian was mature enough to file
an asylum petition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that Elian Gonzalez is a very bright and intelligent
6-year-old,'' the judge said. But he noted it appeared Elian was
unable to write his last name on the asylum petition and that ``a
third party'' answered the questions.
</P>
<P>
   The judge read aloud a question on the asylum form that asks
applicants if they have been associated with various organizations
such as a political party, a labor union, a paramilitary group, a
guerrilla group or the news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're telling me a 6-year-old is competent to answer
questions like that?'' Wilson asked. University of Virginia law
professor David Martin, a former INS general counsel, said if the
court rules on behalf of the government it could lift its current
injunction barring Elian's removal from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After the three-judge panel issues its ruling, the losing party
has 45 days to ask the full 12-member 11th Circuit Court to
reconsider. The ruling also can be appealed to the U.S. Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   But if the injunction is lifted, Gonzalez can take his son back
to Cuba, effectively ending the case, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very possible that if the government wins here, Elian
could be returned to Cuba in a matter of weeks,'' he said.

 &HT;    Hangin' where the auction is
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ There aren't any perfume samples to spritz at
the cosmetics counter, greasy slices of pizza to munch in the food
court, or cute boys to scam on at Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch.
</P>
<P>
   But when mom and pop aren't loaning out the wheels, teen girls
can still shop till they log off thanks to a new auction site.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Girl Zone (www.girlzone.com _ ``where every girl is
cool'') launched an online auction aimed at adolescent shoppers.
BayBuilder of Florida, based in Boca Raton, built the auction
component and will maintain it.
</P>
<P>
   Girl Zone founder and president says bidding on Roxy dresses and
'N Sync CDs is simply one more way to bring girls together. The
site already features interactive features such as chats, bulletin
boards, surveys and a secure e-pal system.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with boys, girls are mostly looking for a sense of
community on the Internet, Mary Jo Reale says.
</P>
<P>
   An auction builds community ties ``with a selling element. Maybe
they'll get a taste for being entrepreneurs,'' Reale says. ``It's
an opportunity for them. . . . Auctions are becoming big in
general, and there aren't a lot of places for teens to do it in
their own community.''
</P>
<P>
   Girls will have the chance to sell and buy everything from art
to jewelry to capri pants. Last week, the most items were on the
block in the site's sports ``department,'' the least in dolls and
dollhouses.
</P>
<P>
   Reale doesn't think the mouse will replace the mall in
teenagers' hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they're like adults who view shopping as a
chore,'' she says. ``They like to go to the mall and see their
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   An online auction ``is just going to be another fun thing for
them to do. . . . An auction implies bargains and fun and all that
kind of stuff.''

 &HT;    Designer lives in the best of both worlds
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Lisa Rowan loves the convenience of Palm Beach _ the
always good-to-go weather, the discount retailers stocked to the
ceiling with everything a home needs, the beach just down the
street from her Chilian Avenue home.
</P>
<P>
   And she loves the culture of Paris _ the art museums, the
fragrant flower stalls, the world-famous gardens and the flea
markets practically at her back door.
</P>
<P>
   So why choose between them? Rowan splits her time between the
two cities, jetting back and forth according to the school schedule
of her 6-year-old son, Krystofer Kimmel.
</P>
<P>
   Her career in the fashion industry _ she calls herself a
``creative consultant'' _ has taken Rowan around the globe. A
Pennsylvania native, Rowan became public-relations and advertising
director for the late designer Willi Smith shortly after college
graduation.
</P>
<P>
   That led to a PR job with Christian Dior in Paris. And then a
promotions position with Revlon in Tokyo. And then a job based in
Milan with Giorgio Armani, as coordinator for his Japanese market.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then I got pregnant and had a baby, and became Mom,'' she
says. The need to slow down during her pregnancy took her to Palm
Beach, where her family had owned a home for years. Rowan bought
her own place, a two-story Mediterranean house built in 1925.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Palm Beach, Krystofer was soon logging frequent flyer
miles with Rowan. He learned to walk in Provence and ski in
Switzerland. But the approach of elementary school meant the pair
needed to settle down, comparatively speaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I happen to like Europe, and my son has roots in Palm Beach,
so I'm trying to keep those roots going,'' Rowan says. ``I have
nothing against the States, but the States will always be there. I
want to take the best of both worlds and marry them.''
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, ``there's life. There's color. You grow up looking at
beauty every day,'' she says. ``Paris is cool, and it's safe. It's
much more interesting and relaxed. The people want to work hard and
do well, but it's not just about money.''
</P>
<P>
   She and Krystofer have flown between Paris and Palm Beach for
the past three years, and almost two years ago they began renting a
140-year-old house near the Luxembourg Gardens on Paris' eclectic
Left Bank, an easy walk from Krystofer's school, L'Ecole
Aujourd'hui (''School for Today'').
</P>
<P>
   It was a long search that led Rowan to her home on Boulevard de
Port Royal. She had looked at 40 apartments in two months, and then
one day saw a newspaper ad for a three-story house for rent. It had
12-foot ceilings, a working fireplace in every room and a
wood-beamed attic with natural light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked in and said, `Oh my God,' '' she recalls. ``It was so
rare, magical and beautiful. But I was afraid I couldn't afford
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners asked Rowan what she would want to change if she
moved in. She said she'd remove the door between the kitchen and
dining room so an old plate warmer built into the wall could be
easily seen. ``This is beautiful. Why hide it?''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that one of the owners was born in the house, and
Rowan's appreciation of its intrinsic beauty touched her. Because
of that, they agreed on a price within Rowan's range.
</P>
<P>
   ``God was looking out for me,'' she says. ``I take zero
credit.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Wednesday, the courtyard shared by Rowan and seven
other families was filled with the laughter of children enjoying a
sunny afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Krystofer took a break to make his friends a snack in the skylit
kitchen. ``I like French cookies a lot,'' he contributed, artfully
arranging a tray with three glasses of milk and a plate of Langue
de Chat cookies (butter cookies that are called ``cat's tongue''
because of their shape). ``This is a collage.''
</P>
<P>
   (How many first graders do you know who throw off the word
``collage'' in casual conversation? Krystofer is already bilingual,
and if Rowan has her way, he'll be multilingual by the age of 15,
adding Spanish and Italian to his French and English.)
</P>
<P>
   The secluded courtyard and each home's private garden were a
major selling point (Rowan's garden is decorated with lawn chairs
from Target). ``There are not a lot of places in Paris where he can
run out the door and play,'' Rowan says. ``You don't have to get in
the car and go somewhere else and drag the bike. It's all right
here.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all of Paris' charms, it is found lacking, too. Rowan's
kitchen, for one example, is stocked with Publix sponges and Target
mixing bowls. ``You can't find this stuff here,'' Rowan says. She
makes a list of household odds and ends and then shops for them
when she returns to the States. ``Target has saved my life.''
</P>
<P>
   So has Costco. ``When I come back here, my suitcase is filled
with Saran Wrap and aluminum foil from Costco because the foil here
falls to pieces as soon as you touch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Day to day, ``the United States functions a lot better in
practical ways,'' says Rowan, though she hastens to add that she's
had more problems with her phone lines in Palm Beach than in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it this way: When I walk into Publix and I think of
the market across the street from me (in Paris), I want to cry,''
Rowan says.
</P>
<P>
   But there is the sense of history in Paris: ``That little corner
restaurant will be there for the next 100 years. Look at Palm
Beach. They change every five days.''
</P>
<P>
   Living in the design capital of the world also allows Rowan, who
says she is ``closing in on 40 and reveling in it,'' to ``take all
the pieces that I know and put the puzzle together.'' She wants to
work with young artists and product designers and help put them in
touch with the contacts she's made over the years. Fashion designer
Tom Ford, now with Gucci, is a friend from her days in Milan, and
French designer Philippe Starck will attend a cocktail party at
Rowan's home this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to take what's good and unique here and take it to the
U.S.,'' she says. ``Now I'm getting into what I really want to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Highlights of Rowan's Paris home, bottom to top:
</P>
<P>
   The stone-walled basement dates to the late 1700s.
</P>
<P>
   It's where Rowan keeps her washer and dryer, and it will be the
location of ``Studio 85,'' a tongue-in-cheek re-creation of a
nightclub replete with disco balls, ponyskin butterfly chairs and,
on the way, a pingpong table from Costco.
</P>
<P>
   A red velvet rope stands ready to barricade the entrance, along
with life-size, wooden cutouts of Bahamian guards. Rowan found the
rope and the ``bouncers'' at Paris flea markets.
</P>
<P>
   She plans to throw her first costume party in Studio 85 this
summer; her friends have decided she's going as Janis Joplin.
</P>
<P>
   The living room and adjoining dining area are so airy and
photogenic that they served as a backdrop for a Christmas catalog
shoot for Marks &AMP; Spencer.
</P>
<P>
   Filled with light from French doors that open onto the garden,
the living room is an homage to Rowan's knack for decorating
inexpensively. It contains a circular, ruby red rug from Ikea, a
pair of antique taupe armchairs and '50s leather chairs from a
Paris flea market. ``The whole place is just a mishmash,'' Rowan
says.
</P>
<P>
   Arrangements of irises, tulips and hydrangeas, purchased from
the neighborhood flower market and plucked from Rowan's own garden,
spring forth from tall, slender vases in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   In the dining area is a colorful glass-blown chandelier by
Washington artist Dale Chihuly. Rowan hosts regular, rambunctious
Sunday brunches at this table. The weekend before our visit,
actress Sigourney Weaver was a guest, and on Easter Sunday, 25
adults and kids showed up for an egg hunt.
</P>
<P>
   If some of the upstairs rooms _ bedrooms, office space and a
room-sized closet _ have a less-than-finished quality, that's
because Rowan doesn't like to rush the decorating process,
preferring to wait until she finds just the right piece for each
spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place was empty until September; but I knew my space and
I would just go down Dixie and find all my different stuff,'' Rowan
says. Before that, when she and Krystofer would visit the
apartment, they'd sleep on futons in the empty living room. ``We
didn't care,'' she says. ``We had our duvet and our pillows.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, some of the upper rooms feature posters and mirrors
from Paris flea markets, cozy antique beds and a blue velvet couch
from Pottery Barn.
</P>
<P>
   And here's a small remembrance of her other home: Copies of
Ocean Drive Palm Beach in a magazine rack. Rowan has tried to
create an informal, welcoming environment on each side of the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both doors are always open. People come in and out,'' she
says. ``I love design, but you live your life and that's its own
design.''

   NEW YORK _ Joking that ``rumors of my demise are greatly

brushed aside repeated questions about whether he had had an affair

Lategano-Nicholas, as the mayor's wife suggested this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said everything I was going to say about that a long time
ago,'' Giuliani said during a packed, raucous news conference in
which he frequently said ``shhhhhh!'' to yelling, shoving
reporters. ``Cristyne Lategano was an excellent communications
director; she did a great job for the city of New York. I've
definitively answered all those questions, and I'm not going to
drag somebody else's reputation into this.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that ``what's going on right now has to do with Donna
and me, and what you're trying to do is a backdoor way of trying to
dredge this all up so you can write more salacious stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   In August 1997, Giuliani said that a Vanity Fair article
asserting that he had had an ``intimate'' relationship with
Lategano-Nicholas was ``scurrilous'' and ``untrue'' and that the
best thing about the article ``is that it can be thrown in the
trash.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday Giuliani added that Lategano-Nicholas was doing an
``excellent job'' as president of NYC and Co., the city's tourism
bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's news conference, at a public school on the Lower
East Side, was the latest public spectacle in the life of a man who
in the last two weeks announced that he has prostate cancer, has a
``very good'' woman friend, is separating from his wife of 16 years
and is still running for Senate against Hillary Rodham Clinton. But
unlike Giuliani's emotional display of sadness and regret on
Wednesday, when he abruptly announced that he and his wife were
separating, the mayor returned Thursday to his more combative, and
familiar, public persona.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani frequently berated reporters for their unruly behavior
_ ``Do you realize that you embarrass yourselves doing this in the
eyes of just about everybody?'' he said at one point _ and snapped
at others. When one reporter asked if there might be
``criminality'' involved with giving Lategano the job at the
tourist bureau, Giuliani shot back: ``Oh, get out of here. Get
lost. Get lost. That's a sneaky way of trying to invade somebody's
personal life.''
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor also displayed his new willingness to answer a
variety of questions about his personal life, and was at times
lighthearted. When one reporter asked if the mayor was
``politically dead,'' Giuliani laughed and responded: ``I'm
sensitive to that word, you know, that last word you used, in any
respect. Dead? No, I'm not dead. Rumors of my demise are greatly
exaggerated.''
</P>
<P>
   While many Republicans across the state continued to express
doubts that the mayor would stay in the race, others said they
believed his performance at his news conference had stanched the
political hemorrhaging, for now. In either case, most said publicly
only that they felt sadness about the mayor's situation. Giuliani
even received words of sympathy from his opponent's husband,
President Clinton, whose relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky
resulted in his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish him and his wife and their children well on the health
front and on the domestic front,'' Clinton said in response to a
question in the Rose Garden of the White House. ``I think that's
all there is _ all anybody would want.'' The president added:
``I've always had a good personal relationship with Mayor Giuliani.
It's not been affected by the fact that I think my wife would be a
better senator. And on this, I think everybody in New York and
everybody in America ought to be rooting for the human side of this
to work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George E. Pataki, speaking to reporters in Rockland County
on Thursday, said: ``My hope is he will still run.'' Pressed on
what contingency plans the party had in place if Giuliani were to
withdraw, Pataki replied: ``We're still letting the mayor with his
family work through the decisions. And I think people should
respect that this is a difficult time for Rudy and his family.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior aide to Pataki told reporters not even to ask Pataki if
he himself would step in to campaign for the Senate seat. ``He's
not running,'' the aide decreed.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign advisers to the mayor, who said they had no idea on
Wednesday that Giuliani was going to announce his separation,
presented a cheerier picture Thursday, and said the mayor had told
them in the morning to proceed with all campaign plans.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But longtime critics of Giuliani criticized the mayor for his
friendship with Lategano-Nicholas and the mayor's involvement in
helping her get a $150,000-a-year post at the tourism bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``This story has legs,'' said former Mayor Edward Koch, a
frequent critic of Giuliani's. ``I think it's an abuse of power. It
may not be a technical abuse, but in the court of opinion, it's an
abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Lategano-Nicholas said she took the day off Thursday to
celebrate the 40th birthday of her husband, Nicholas Nicholas, whom
she married in February. She said in an interview Thursday that she
had never had a sexual relationship with Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Hanover's press secretary, Joannie Danielides, said Hanover
spent Thursday making breakfast for her two children, taking them
to school, handling correspondence at her office and then recording
voice-overs at a New York City studio for her ``House Beautiful''
show on the A&AMP;E network.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he spent his day working in his office at City
Hall, holding his press conference and meeting with two doctors to
talk about his treatment for cancer. He said at his news conference
that he had no timetable for announcing his decision on treatment
or whether he would stay in the race. But aides said Thursday that
they expected him to think about his options over the weekend and
perhaps make an announcement next week.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said he would continue to cut his campaign schedule in
half as he meets with doctors, making it unclear whether he would
attend four fund-raisers scheduled next Tuesday and Wednesday in
California. Aides said that for the time being all four events _ in
Los Angeles, San Diego, Santa Barbara and Orange County _ were
still on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said Thursday that the mayor would decide on the
race based almost solely on his health, but also said that they
would not be surprised if he took a poll in the next few days to
determine how his personal life had affected his standing with
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also said that while there was enormous sympathy for
Giuliani, there was also bewilderment among party members over why
he had announced his separation without first informing his wife _
a decision, they said, that may have caused Hanover's angry
announcement on Wednesday about Lategano-Nicholas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He essentially asked for her to go nuclear by behaving that
way,'' one top state Republican official said.

 &HT;    How to shop a brocante
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ What does it take to score the perfect
headboard or a dinette to die for?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something that clicks, and it's just destiny,'' says
fashion consultant Lisa Rowan, who has decorated her Palm Beach and
Paris homes with purchases from flea markets and thrift stores here
and abroad. ``I don't find anything. It finds me.''
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes in the most unexpected places.
</P>
<P>
   When Rowan dropped by a St. Louis consignment shop in search of
'50s furniture, she wound up wrapped in a leopard coat from the
'60s for $800. Not bad for mint-condition fur with a Paris designer
label.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, she was shopping for shelves (which, incidentally,
she still doesn't have) when a vibrant red rug caught her eye. It's
now the visual centerpiece of her Paris living room. Which brings
us to Rowan's premiere piece of home-shopping advice: ``Luck is one
thing, and paying attention to and taking advantage of luck is the
next thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's more flea-marketing advice from Rowan and Claudia
Strasser, owner of The Paris Apartment store in New York and author
of a book by the same name:
</P>
<P>
   Break away from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Bargains can be found everywhere, but you'll have more
competition if you browse a city's most famous markets or stores.
See what treasures you find off the beaten path, Strasser suggests.
</P>
<P>
   We wanted to accompany Rowan to Porte de Clignancourt, the
oldest and largest flea market in Paris. And we wanted to go on a
Monday, the last day of the weekend market.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong, Rowan said.
</P>
<P>
   She dragged us to a brocante, a sort of traveling market of
dealers. You can find brocantes through listings in the newspaper
or by keeping your eyes peeled for fliers on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Among the boxes of old eyeglasses and crates of cracked kitchen
tile, there's an air of refinement unusual for a street market.
Shoppers rest at a picnic table with a bottle of red wine. Vendors
sell Belgian waffles, foie-gras sandwiches and crepes. German
shepherds, Irish setters and Boston terriers greet each other
between stalls packed with croquet sets and smiling Buddhas.
</P>
<P>
   Go early and often.
</P>
<P>
   Rowan persuaded us to abandon our Monday shopping plans for a
Friday visit, the first day of the annual brocante we had chosen.
Much better pickings, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers ``will give you a quick fix on the first day, then
they'll hold tight over the next several days and unload on the
last,'' Rowan says.
</P>
<P>
   Wake up early.
</P>
<P>
   It's best if you can get there when vendors are still unpacking,
``just so you know what's out there, what's coming out. Then you'll
know if it's going to be worth your while,'' Strasser says. ``The
best stuff gets picked right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Tour the market at least twice.
</P>
<P>
   Navigate the stalls traveling in one direction and then retrace
your steps. ``If you go around once, you only see it from one
side,'' Strasser says.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the vendor's opinion on the piece.
</P>
<P>
   Do this even if you already have a good idea of its value and
condition. If nothing else, you might learn the history behind that
chaise lounge, Strasser says.
</P>
<P>
   Look for potential.
</P>
<P>
   Some flaws can be solved easily and cheaply with refinishing,
reupholstering or rewiring. On the other hand, if a piece has
structural problems such as a broken leg, it should be very
inexpensive to make it worth your while.
</P>
<P>
   Load up.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to bargain with a dealer, pick more than one item.
``That might help you get a better overall deal,'' Strasser says.
``This gives you a little more leverage.''
</P>
<P>
   If you love it, buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it's $5, $10 or $15 more than what you wanted to spend,
Strasser says. Remember how much effort it took for someone to find
the piece for you and haul it there. Consider the extra cash a
finder's fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably one of a kind and you're not going to see it
again, so just get it,'' Strasser says.
</P>
<P>
   Adds Rowan: ``If something catches your eye and you can afford
it, don't let it go.''

STARS' LAST LINE PERFORMS ITS ROLE WITH ZEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING _ Baseball has the relief pitcher to stop the bleeding or
retain the momentum. Hockey has the fourth line.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of ways, it's kind of the fireman's role,'' said
Stars right winger Blake Sloan, who is playing on the Stars' fourth
line after spending the majority of the season on the checking
line. ``You get called, and you have to come to play. It's a job
that is an important one and one you try to embrace.''
</P>
<P>
   It's often an overlooked job. The fourth liners play the fewest
minutes, don't score much and take a back seat to the team's
scoring lines. But, an effective fourth line, one that turns up the
heat, sacrifices the body and gets the opponent's heads spinning,
can create opportunities and reduce taxing checking
responsibilities for its scoring lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives your first and second line an opportunity to rest
up,'' fourth-line left winger Kirk Muller said.
</P>
<P>
   And that can be crucial against a deep Colorado squad that
possesses a ton of team speed and high-caliber offensive players.
Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said the play of his fourth line will be
critical in the best-of-seven Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we play the game is different than the way Colorado
plays it with the puck,'' Hitchcock said. ``We have to use four
lines. We can't win this series playing three lines and nine
forwards. It's impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado uses four lines, but coach Bob Hartley tends to
interchange an array of depth players on his lines rather than
using a standard group the way the Stars do. Either way, the job
remains the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Play with a lot of energy and enthusiasm, have a great
forecheck, be skating well, take the body; those are the real keys
of those guys' line,'' center Mike Modano said. ``Wearing the
defense out, tiring them down, and then the other lines are able to
step up, and they've got a little bit of jump.''
</P>
<P>
   Heading into tomorrow's Game 1, Aaron Gavey is expected to
continue to center the fourth line. Sloan will handle the right
wing and Muller, who has played on the second, third and fourth
line in the playoffs, will play left wing. Hitchcock also has
impressive rookie Roman Lyashenko and Grant Marshall as
possibilities on the wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a fourth line here that is capable of playing
against anybody and being effective,'' Muller said. ``We're strong
enough defensively, and we can produce offensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Gavey, Muller and Lyashenko each have one goal in the playoffs.
Gavey scored the first goal of the San Jose series and set the tone
for that 4-0 victory. Although Lyashenko and Muller scored their
goals while playing on other lines, that group is more than a
couple of bruisers with limited offensive ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a tight series,'' Muller said, ``if we can chip in that odd
goal here and there, I think it would be huge for the team.''

LOVE HOPES HE FINISHES SAME WAY HE STARTED; TIGER DOESN'T 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ It has been more than two years since Davis Love
III last won a golf tournament. That is a long time for a player of
Love's caliber, long enough for confidence to slip, for frustration
to become overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   So after a sorely needed two-week break from competition, Love
returned Thursday with a fresher outlook, hoping his new attitude
would help him break the mental barriers that have kept him from
winning. Perhaps Love is on the right track. Overcoming extremely
blustery conditions that featured 35 mph wind gusts, Love shot a
four-under-par 66, and was tied for first place with Blaine
McCallister after Thursday's opening round of the GTE Byron Nelson
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Six players were tied for third place at 68 _ Lee Janzen, Billy
Andrade, Sergio Garcia, John Huston, Jerry Smith and Kevin
Sutherland.
</P>
<P>
   But the strong wind that howled consistently made it a miserable
day for many. Ask Tiger Woods, who struggled to a 75, including a
40 on the back nine. After reaching three under par through 10
holes, Woods bogeyed No. 11, double-bogeyed No. 14 and finished
with consecutive bogeys on the last three holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't have the feel of my swing,'' said Woods, playing
his first tournament since the Masters. ``I couldn't hit shots the
way I wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   But hitting good shots in the wind was not a problem for Love,
who played at the TPC of Las Colinas, the more difficult of the
tournament's two courses. McCallister, Andrade, Huston, Garcia,
Smith and Sutherland all played at Cottonwood Valley Thursday, but
they will switch to Las Colinas on Friday, while Love, Janzen and
Woods will play at Cottonwood.
</P>
<P>
   Love was five under par through 17 holes, and he would have
finished alone in first place if he had not made a three-putt bogey
at No. 18. Yet, it remained to be seen if Love would finish what he
has started. Since winning the 1998 MCI Classic, Love has been in
position to win many times, only to fall short. This year alone,
Love already has five top 10 finishes, but he has stumbled in key
situations, failing to break 70 on Sunday during his last five
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   After winning his first major at the 1997 PGA Championship, Love
expected even bigger and better things, but the last two years have
been disappointing. He is still ranked No. 6 in the world, he is
ninth on this year's PGA Tour money list and he is still only 36
years old. But as the months have passed without victories to show
for his efforts, Love admitted he has become frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been trying too hard to win,'' said Love, who has 13
career victories on tour. ``It became more than a goal. It was
becoming an obsession. ``I've been at the top of the money list,
the top of the world rankings, and I haven't won. Something is
getting in the way. Sure, I've got to play to win, but not get
obsessed with it, not get obsessed with beating Tiger and obsessed
with beating David Duval. Just play golf and have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   While Love laments not having won in two years, McCallister has
not won since 1993. He let a great opportunity slip away last
weekend, when he finished second at the Compaq Classic of New
Orleans, losing to Carlos Franco on the second hole of sudden
death. McCallister bogeyed the final hole of regulation in New
Orleans, then he missed a four-foot putt for par on the first
playoff hole. Yet, instead of sulking about the loss, McCallister
responded with a solid round Thursday, and growing up in Fort
Stockton, Texas, gave McCallister experience in playing with a
strong wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen wind,'' said McCallister. ``I've hit driver from 130
yards on a par-3. That's windy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a chance to win that golf tournament last week, and that
hurt. But last week is gone and I was very pleased about what I did
today. I came here to play well and I'm off to a good start.''  &QL;

LITTLE PUCK WARS ARE HUGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING _ Name a goal, any goal.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull's goal to win Stanley Cup Finals last season? Fine.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Primeau's goal in overtime No. 5 last week? That'll do,
too.
</P>
<P>
   You know what they, and just about any other goals, have in
common? Somebody won a faceoff to start the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the start of every play,'' Stars defenseman Sylvain Cote
clarified. ``You either go on offense or defense. You find out by
the draw. If you never have the puck out of the draw, you know you
are not going to do well in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   No, faceoffs won and lost aren't the sexiest stats in the
Western Conference finals. But they might be among the
more-important ones in determining whether the Stars or the
Colorado Avalanche advance to the Stanley Cup Finals. In a series
featuring two very evenly matched teams, who starts with the puck
might be a big difference maker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is,'' Stars center Joe Nieuwendyk said. ``I think
that is one of the successes of our team is that we have good puck
control because we win a lot of faceoffs. We take a lot of pride in
it as centermen.''
</P>
<P>
   Through two rounds of the playoffs, the Stars have the
second-best faceoff percentage in the NHL. Their 55.38 faceoff win
percentage puts them slightly behind the Washington Capitals
(55.59) and way ahead of the Avalanche, which is 10th at 48.05
percent. ``In the defensive zone, they're going to be huge,''
Avalanche forward Peter Forsberg said. ``And special teams, when
you win in the offensive zone, that's 30 seconds off the clock
right after that.''
</P>
<P>
   First, a little bit of information on the faceoff.
</P>
<P>
   The faceoff is to hockey what the jump ball is to basketball.
Only every time there is a stoppage in play, the faceoff is how
they start back up. Faceoffs are usually taken by centermen and
there are rules to the faceoff. They weren't really considered that
big of a deal until the NHL started distributing the numbers a
couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes to the players who take them, the Stars and
Avalanche have some of the best in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to face some of the good ones in this series,''
Nieuwendyk said not figuring he needed to mention guys like Joe
Sakic and Chris Drury.
</P>
<P>
   Ask any of the Stars, and they'll tell you Nieuwendyk is one of
the best in the league himself. He ranks second in the NHL through
two rounds of playoffs, winning 62.03 percent of his faceoffs. The
Stars' Guy Carbonneau isn't too bad at 60.6 percent, which is
fifth-best.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very strong, and they're known to have the best team
in the league in faceoffs,'' San Jose Sharks forward Vincent
Damphousse said of the Stars. ``I know what their guys do. It's no
secret.''
</P>
<P>
   There aren't a lot of secrets in the faceoff circle. Back when
it used to be a case of who could cheat the best, there were plenty
of secrets. They started enforcing the rules a couple of years ago,
and the ways to win became simple.
</P>
<P>
   Be quicker. Be stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one or the other really,'' Stars forward Kirk Muller
said. ``You try to beat them with quickness or speed or you try to
outmuscle the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's the key to winning one?
</P>
<P>
   Just line up against Nieuwendyk.
</P>
<P>
   You immediately notice that he has a wide stance, a little bit
wider than shoulder width apart. The knees bend slightly as he
bends at the waist. Nieuwendyk's left hand is lower on the stick
with the top of the hand facing out. The right hand is on the top
of the stick, grabbing it from the underside.
</P>
<P>
   His head turns to the linesman who drops the puck. The key is to
read the drop, win the drop. Timing, indeed, is everything in the
world of the faceoff, and Nieuwendyk has the quickest draw on the
Stars.
</P>
<P>
   So what do Nieuwendyk's teammates notice about his faceoffs?
</P>
<P>
   ``They are usually going to be won,'' Stars winger Jamie
Langenbrunner said. ``It's such a nice thing for me and Scotty
\RThornton\S. You are not focused. You don't have to waste all that
energy chasing the puck. You are starting with the puck. You are
getting the puck to places you want to do, which is key when you
are out there for 40 seconds, to get going right away.''
</P>
<P>
   When you really think about it, the faceoff is kind of a sexy
stat.
</P>
<P>
   You can't win if you don't score. You can't score if you don't
have the puck. You don't have the puck a lot if you don't win a
fair share of faceoffs.
</P>
<P>
   So does it follow that you can't win games if you can't win
faceoffs?
</P>
<P>
   ``Game 7 against Quebec, I lost against Peter Stastny in a
faceoff,'' Carbonneau said. ``We lost the series. After that, it
was kind of ... So you either get better, or they don't ask you any
more.''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ In pointed questions to lawyers for both sides in the
custody battle for Elian Gonzalez, three federal judges wondered
Thursday how a 6-year-old who cannot even sign his full name could
apply for political asylum but questioned whether sending him back
to communist Cuba was in his best interests, regardless of his
father's fitness as a parent.
</P>
<P>
   Judge J.L. Edmondson, a conservative judge appointed to the 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals by President Ronald Reagan, noted
that it was not uncommon for courts to rule that a child's best
interests override the rights of a parent, as in the case of
parents who refuse their child a doctor's care because of their
religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Edmondson, who twice referred to Cuba as a ``communist,
totalitarian state,'' said it was not that such parents did not
believe they were acting in their child's behalf, but that their
actions seemed ``so conspicuously in conflict with the needs of the
child.''
</P>
<P>
   During lulls in the arguments, some 100 protesters just outside
the courtroom could be faintly heard chanting, ``Free Elian!''
Later, as lawyers for the government and for Elian's father left
the courtroom, the protesters shouted, ``Communist!'' over and
over. The outbursts, which have been commonplace in Miami for
months now, puzzled many in Atlanta as they walked past the
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Edmondson, the senior member of the three-judge panel that heard
the appeal of a decision by a federal district judge in Miami that,
in effect, denied a request by Elian's relatives in that city for a
political asylum hearing, said before Thursday's hearing that a
decision would probably come in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Immigration and Naturalization Service have
repeatedly argued that Elian is simply not old enough to understand
the application for political asylum that he signed in a childlike
scrawl after it appeared that federal officials were planning to
send him back to Cuba to be with his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
And, the lawyers for the government argued again Thursday, only the
father can speak for his son.
</P>
<P>
   This hearing may be the last chance the Miami relatives have of
keeping Elian in the United States in defiance of his father's
wishes, legal experts said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. immigration officials and the federal district court in
Miami have already rejected the request for any asylum hearing
filed on Elian's behalf by his great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez, who
took care of the boy after he was found clinging to an inner tube
in the Atlantic. Elian was rescued on Thanksgiving Day after his
mother drowned in an effort to cross from Cuba to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Elian Gonzalez is a very bright and intelligent
6-year-old, but he didn't even have the ability to sign his last
name on the asylum petition,'' said Judge Charles R. Wilson, an
appointee of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, whose third member is Judge Joel Dubina, who was
appointed by President George Bush and is considered a moderate,
has several options, legal experts and lawyers for both sides say.
It could rule that immigration officials were correct in denying
the boy an asylum hearing based on his age, even though immigration
laws guarantee an asylum hearing for ``any alien.''
</P>
<P>
   Or it could order immigration officials to give Elian a hearing,
even though the boy is now in the legal custody of his father in a
secluded federal retreat in Maryland. The reunion followed an armed
federal raid on the relatives' home in Miami in the pre-dawn hours
of April 22.
</P>
<P>
   Or the court could ask immigration officials to speak with the
boy about his wishes, but not in a formal hearing.
</P>
<P>
   If the court rules against the Miami relatives, it could also
lift an injunction that bars Elian from leaving the country,
allowing father and son to return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   There is no guarantee that the full court _ there are 12 active
judges on the 11th Circuit bench _ or the U.S. Supreme Court will
hear the case if the three-judge panel rules against the Miami
family.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual address to the crowded courtroom just minutes
before the hearing, Edmondson, not yet dressed in his robe,
cautioned lawyers and onlookers that they should not try to draw
conclusions from the panel's questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is entirely possible that a judge may make a statement or
ask a question that is the exact opposite of what he is thinking,
because he may want to see how the lawyers respond to it,''
Edmondson said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the hearing, which lasted less than an hour and a half,
it seemed at least that lawyers for Lazaro Gonzalez had found a
sympathetic ear in Edmondson.
</P>
<P>
   He compared the case, in theory, to that of a child who had been
rescued from a communist country in the former Soviet Union by a
mother who gave her life to deliver him to freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall Coffey, a lawyer for the Miami family, said Elian would
be paraded around Cuba, more a trophy than a boy growing up in his
old life there. His father would have little to say about his son's
life, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no parent in Cuba who controls what happens to his or
her child, and there is no power in this country,'' Coffey said of
the United States, ``that can protect this child if he is removed
to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gregory Craig, a lawyer for Juan Miguel Gonzalez, said the
boy's father was not being manipulated by the government of
President Fidel Castro and was free to ``openly express his
feelings and his opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked by the panel why it had taken his client five months to
come to the United States to seek the return of his son, Craig said
Gonzalez tried to work through his own government to get Elian
returned to him.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Wilson seemed skeptical of how Elian could have understood a
complicated form requesting an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   He also questioned whether, considering the fact that Elian is
now in the custody of his father, immigration officials could even
accept an application filed by someone who no longer has custody of
the child.
</P>
<P>
   The question of Elian's request for asylum may be moot if the
judges accept the premise that he never filed for asylum, that he
only scratched his name on the form because he was told to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really wasn't Elian who filed an asylum application; it was
Lazaro Gonzalez who filed the application for him,'' said Bernard
Perlmutter, director of the University of Miami Children and Youth
Law Clinic. ``People other than the father were making claims on
behalf of the child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think the court has to be swayed by the paramount
interest of the child,'' Perlmutter said. ``Are the facts in this
case sufficient to warrant an intrusion in the father's rights to
speak for his son? I don't think there is sufficient evidence that
anyone other than Juan Miguel Gonzalez can speak for Elian in this
case.''
</P>
<P>
   To ultimately win, even if the case does wind up in an asylum
hearing, lawyers for the boy's Miami relatives must prove that
Elian was being persecuted for political reasons and that he was
afraid of that persecution, legal experts said.
</P>
<P>
   That, for a 6-year-old boy, would seem unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no objective basis for an independent asylum claim,''
a spokesman for the Justice Department said.

 &HT;    50 million French women can't be wrong
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ What Switzerland is to timekeeping and Great Britain is
to ceremony, France is to fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The French didn't simply write the book on style, they built the
Librarie du Mode.
</P>
<P>
   Hermes, Chanel and Dior donated their design services. The
French language contributed entire sections to the global fashion
dictionary (see chambray, chamois, chapeau, chenille, chic,
chiffon, chignon...).
</P>
<P>
   And French women established an enviable fashion code, a sort of
Dewey Decimal system of sophisticated dressing that remains
somewhat impenetrable to admiring outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   You say you want a library card? As they say in France, bonne
chance.
</P>
<P>
   You have gone to Paris to study this foreign concept _ the way
French women dress. The way they are cheesecake, and the rest of us
are plain cream cheese.
</P>
<P>
   You have foolishly chosen to wear the internationally recognized
Official Uniform of the Tourist: Schlumpy black turtleneck. Faded
red sweatshirt. Oversized black jeans. Hiking boots that look so
ridiculous on your feet that a friend asks, ``Did you buy those
just for the trip?'' You did.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the natives clicking down the boulevards in their
delicate heels, you are Frumpus Americanus.
</P>
<P>
   ``In America, there's a dressed-down syndrome. It's so dreary,''
says interior designer and author Alexandra Stoddard, who visits
Paris four times a year. ``A Frenchwoman can be going for a root
canal, and you'd never know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another thing about a Frenchwoman: She'd rather have a root
canal than dress like the typical American.
</P>
<P>
   This is what the typical Parisian wears to the dentist, the
cafe, the museum, the office:
</P>
<P>
   Skinny, skinny pants _ To best display her skinny, skinny
figure, which defies logic in a land of croissants, brie and red
wine.
</P>
<P>
   Slim-fitting black leather jacket _ The better to say, ``I am
cool like Jean-Paul Belmondo, no?''
</P>
<P>
   High-heeled boots or pointy-toed mules _ Feminine, but not
necessarily comfortable, footwear.
</P>
<P>
   And, always, a scarf _ Effortlessly tied at the neck or tossed
over the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   When a Frenchwoman wears a scarf, people say, ``Look how
fabulously French she is!''
</P>
<P>
   When you wear a scarf, people say, ``Oh, you're wearing a
scarf!''
</P>
<P>
   American-born Lisa Rowan, who lives in Paris and Palm Beach,
nods sympathetically. ``Frenchwomen will take a paper towel and tie
it a certain way, and they have a whole new deal.''
</P>
<P>
   She offers the example of her Paris neighbor, Beatrice. ``She
can be wearing sneakers and Bermuda shorts, and she still has her
style.''
</P>
<P>
   But why does Beatrice have her style? Why, why, why?
</P>
<P>
   You want answers. Straight from la source.
</P>
<P>
   You seek out Veronique and Virginie Morana, a mother and
daughter who own a small jewelry store on the Right Bank and
recently wrote The Parisian Woman's Guide to Style (Universe, $20).
They welcome you _ a matching madame and mademoiselle with accents
so charming and ... well, so French, that they turn the simplest of
words (''fat,'' ``bag,'' ``shoe'') into pure poetry.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the Moranas point out that there's no such thing
as a single style of dressing in Paris, silly American.
</P>
<P>
   There are the trendy women of the Left Bank, the kind of
hipsters encountered by beatnik-seeking Audrey Hepburn in Funny
Face. Then there's the avant-garde crowd, the risk-taking women of
the hip Marais district who follow the work of young designers.
</P>
<P>
   The style we all ``ooh la la'' over, though, is referred to as
BCBG, or bon chic bon genre, (translated: good style, good
attitude). It's the look most associated with the elegant ladies of
the Right Bank. (No wonder the BCBG clothing line, which has a
store at The Gardens mall, adopted the name.)
</P>
<P>
   For the BCBG woman, ``the basic outfit is really simple and
sober and black,'' Veronique says, ``but the Parisian woman is
always looking for details to bring out,'' such as a brilliant red
necklace paired with that somber black dress. ``It's not nice to
really complicate things. You can always just add accessories. . .
. It's the accessories that make the outfits look `in'.''
</P>
<P>
   There's some strategy behind those accessories, however. If the
Frenchwoman wears an oversized necklace, she'll keep her pearl or
diamond earrings very small or leave off the earrings all together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't wear all matching bracelets, necklaces and
rings,'' Virginie says. ``You want to keep it simple.''
</P>
<P>
   (Michael Kors, who designs for the Paris house Celine when he's
not tweaking his own line in New York, has this advice for American
women wanting to emulate the French: Before you leave the house in
the morning, remove one piece of jewelry. ``Americans have a
tendency to pile too much on,'' he says.)
</P>
<P>
   Frenchwomen also focus on their feet. ``It's the shoes that make
the outfit look good or not,'' Veronique says. ``You can have the
same black dress every year, but the shoes will make the outfit
look fashionable.''
</P>
<P>
   She adds: ``This year, it's the mule,'' slippers that cover the
toes but not the heel. The mid-heeled mules the Moranas are wearing
this season are extra-pointy with a squared-off tip.
</P>
<P>
   (Claudia Strasser, who worked in Paris before opening the Paris
Apartment design store in New York, also stresses the importance of
shoes. Compare the sneakers of the women you see in a New York
subway car to the stilettos you spot on the Paris Metro, she says.
The Parisians ``are probably all wearing Italian shoes,'' says
Strasser, who now lives in Pembroke Pines. A Parisian's shoes, in
addition to the way she emphasizes quality over quantity, set her
apart.)
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the issue of size.
</P>
<P>
   ``French clothing is very close to the body, as Parisian women
of all ages seek to maintain a young, feminine allure,'' the
Moranas write in their book.
</P>
<P>
   ``In France, you don't have extra-large,'' Virginie says. (In
France, they don't need extra-large. The chairs, the beds, the
showers, the entire population is petite compared with Super Sized,
Barcalounging, SUV-driving Americans. Ten percent of French women
are overweight; 55 percent of American women are too heavy.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Parisian woman, if her size is large, she prefers to buy a
medium,'' Virginie says. Some shop owners, conscious of their
customers' self-image, will even replace the tags of large shirts
or jackets. Or they'll simply snip them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Parisian woman doesn't like to have loose things,'' says
Virginie, a slender slip of a young woman. ``She likes to be
small.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's because French women ultimately have a very
specific audience in mind when they dress: French men.
</P>
<P>
   ``They go to lunch with their friends, and they like to show
off,'' to win an admiring glance from the man at the next table,
Veronique says. ``They're happy to be watched and looked at.''
</P>
<P>
   True story: The co-worker you are traveling with ducks into a
bank while you walk down the street to buy a phone card.
</P>
<P>
   You return three minutes later. He looks dazed and feverish.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? An armed robbery? A really great exchange rate?
</P>
<P>
   No, mon ami.
</P>
<P>
   A Frenchwoman smiled at him, and his day, his week, his month
has been made.
</P>
<P>
   He swears it wasn't her slim trousers or close-fitting leather
jacket that did it (although he remembered these items when you
quizzed him about her outfit weeks later, did he not?!). ``She
could have been wearing a potato sack for all I cared,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But you know better . . .
</P>
<P>
   In the country that birthed Brigitte Bardot, the woman most
ogled these days by French men _ quite a few American fellas, too _
is Laetitia Casta.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the bodacious 22-year-old Victoria's Secret and Sports
Illustrated swimsuit model was elected the new ``Marianne,'' the
country's official symbol of beauty and virtue.
</P>
<P>
   Casta's bust _ make that, a sculptural likeness of her head _
will be displayed in town halls across France.
</P>
<P>
   As for the French women whom French women admire, these are
among the creme de la creme:
</P>
<P>
   ``Above all, Catherine Deneuve,'' says Veronique Morana.
</P>
<P>
   Considered by many to be the world's most beautiful woman, the
French actress is forever a picture of sophistication and
understated elegance. For decades she's maintained a sleek look
characterized by her blond mane, demure suits and simple gold
jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incredibly chic, timeless, classic,'' says celebrity stylist
Phillip Bloch, whose clients include Halle Berry and Salma Hayek.
``She's a role model for a woman of any age, for any look. You
don't have to be blond and 50 or 60 to admire Catherine Deneuve's
style. She was my father's favorite, and she's still sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   Also admired, the models and actresses in Chanel advertisements
(Deneuve once shilled for Chanel No. 5). Their upper-class sense of
refinement ``corresponds very well to Parisian style,'' Veronique
says.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most well-known Chanel models was Coco Chanel
look-alike Ines de la Fressange, who served as designer Karl
Lagerfeld's muse throughout the '80s before founding her own design
house in 1991. She was also the pre-Casta ``Marianne.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Fressange, inducted into the International Best-Dressed
Hall of Fame two years ago, embodies several attributes of dressing
the French way: clean-lined clothes, simple hair and makeup, and a
reliance on a handful of wardrobe staples.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I have few clothes, I manage better than when I have a
lot, because I use my imagination,'' she once told Elle magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Also putting a pretty face on French style are the women of
Lancome advertisements, such as actress Juliette Binoche, Veronique
says.
</P>
<P>
   Binoche has said that she prefers natural beauty to
contrivances. ``In Los Angeles, it's incredible how the women all
look like Barbie dolls,'' she said in a interview with a French
magazine. ``But it's a manufactured beauty: makeup, false
eyelashes, false nails, false breasts . . . It all rings false.''
</P>
<P>
   Day after day, outfit after outfit, the Frenchwomen you meet are
an endless parade of cute names, glamorous jobs and sartorial
perfection. And then there's that, how shall we say, admirable
French self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a chic suit, Marika works at Chanel. (And tells you
that you ``do not know enough about fabrics'' to call yourself a
fashion editor.)
</P>
<P>
   Tiny Claire works at the Opera Garnier and, trained as a
ballerina, dresses in the dancer's patented sloppy-yet-stylish way.
(And when you politely try to learn more about the opera after a
hasty tour, she says, ``Now is the time that you must leave!'')
</P>
<P>
   Marie Gabrielle works at Louis Vuitton and sports a scarf that
appears to have been knotted by an origami master. (She has an
uncanny way of ignoring your questions and discussing exactly what
she wants to talk about.)
</P>
<P>
   You stand there in your hiking boots, the big American galoot _
sans a snug Chanel suit, a ballerina's body, a damn scarf or an
Attitude with a capital A.
</P>
<P>
   How can you compete?
</P>
<P>
   And then you meet Alan Faye.
</P>
<P>
   Alan is a student of global fashion, having lived in New York,
Los Angeles, London and, for the past eight years, Paris. He
designs accessories for Issey Miyake and Hugo Boss, and also has
his own line of leather goods and jewelry that's sold by Neiman
Marcus.
</P>
<P>
   Alan tells you that the way Frenchwomen dress is relatively easy
to mimic. No need to feel intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``this is not a fashionable city,'' Alan says. ``People
who you see around town who are fashionable are not from Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   (Then again, who needs fashion? Coco Chanel once said, ``Fashion
changes but style endures.'')
</P>
<P>
   Parisians do know style, Alan admits. ``They're very
suit-oriented, they're very into established labels. They buy
things from Yves St. Laurent, Burberry and Cartier because they
can't go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   He says, ``They don't want to appear vulgar, and if you take a
risk and you don't have personal style, it can be what the French
call vulgar. . . . It's difficult to make mistakes when you don't
take any risks.''
</P>
<P>
   He outlines the safety-first uniform of the older Frenchwoman:
Navy turtleneck, navy knee-length skirt, yellow cashmere cardigan,
navy blue stockings, flat navy shoes, Cartier earrings, Cartier
watch.
</P>
<P>
   The younger generation has changed, he says, and pulls from the
closets of au courant design houses. ``They're more into Prada and
Gucci.''
</P>
<P>
   When icicles hang from the Eiffel Tower, Parisians of all ages
reach for longish parkas that cover the fanny. Alan starts pointing
out parkas as they walk down the street. ``There's one. . . .
There's two more. . . . There's another one. . . . His wife has a
matching one. . . . Look, the whole family has the same jacket.''
</P>
<P>
   While Alan frowns on the unimaginative parka, he applauds the
ubiquitous scarf.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're born knowing how to tie that scarf. It's like how do
ducks know how to fly in that direction,'' he says. ``They've been
tying that little scarf since they were 2 years old.'' (Entire
books on scarf-tying have been written for fumbling Americans. One
of the most recent: Edie Weber's How to Tie Scarves, Sterling
Publications, $10.)
</P>
<P>
   Alan is Chicken Soup for the Feeling-Inferior-to-French-Women
Soul.
</P>
<P>
   And then the wonderful Alan offers the piece de resistance:
Shopping like a Frenchwoman is easy, he says. Simply decrease the
number of things you buy while increasing the quality of the items
you do purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Here, a handy shopping guide, a List of 10 Items Every French
Woman Has in Her Closet (courtesy of Virginie and Veronique
Morana):
</P>
<P>
   1. A suit. Trousers and a fitted coat in either black or dark
gray. A suit can be worn across different seasons and can be
dressed up or down depending on the shirt underneath.
</P>
<P>
   2. A black dress. Always versatile, always in style. It can be
outfitted for evening with sparkly accessories or worn in the day
with the jacket from the black suit.
</P>
<P>
   3. A twin set. The favored colors: Beige, taupe, gray or black.
</P>
<P>
   4. A leather jacket. Preferrably in black.
</P>
<P>
   5. Leather trousers or skirt. Also in _ surprise _ black.
</P>
<P>
   (What's with all the black? The Moranas explain in their book
that neutrals ``never stand out in a crowd. The Parisian woman's
respect for classic, good taste motivates her to dress so that she
will blend into any social milieu.'')
</P>
<P>
   6. A white blouse. ``The only wardrobe element that changes with
different trends,'' the Moranas write. The current look: The
fitted, cotton T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   7. Closed-toe pumps. For daytime wear, the heels should be under
2 inches, ``something you can trot around in,'' Veronique says.
</P>
<P>
   8. A matching bag and belt. Expensive, preferably with a logo.
``Last year it was Dior, this year it's Vuitton,'' Virginie says.
</P>
<P>
   9. A pearl necklace. Never out, a simple strand of pearls can
accessorize the suit, the black dress, the twin set ...
</P>
<P>
   10. A silk scarf. The most important accessory for French style
and one of the few non-black items in a Parisian's wardrobe. The
Moranas favor a mix of bright colors that will complement and add
pop to several outfits.
</P>
<P>
   So how do Frenchwomen know how to assemble that closet of
basics? Do they offer a course at the Sorbonne? Is it something in
the Seine?
</P>
<P>
   It's partly a matter of culture, says Jeff Stone of Chic Simple,
the lifestyle company that preaches the very French gospel of buy
less, own more.
</P>
<P>
   In the years following World War II, Europeans were forced to
learn the art of building a wardrobe, and smart shoppers sought
clothes that would look tres chic longer than a season or two.
``They had to buy things that would have a life to them,'' Stone
says. ``It's a more holistic approach to dressing.''
</P>
<P>
   The French are content with owning, and wearing, fewer pieces
than acquisitive Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not as heavy-duty a consumer as American women,'' Alan
Faye says. ``They buy two or three outfits of higher quality.
That's where the scarves come in, to accessorize and make them look
different.''
</P>
<P>
   And they believe in the basics. In Paris, women cherish a good
haircut, regular manicures and appointments with a seamstress,
designer Michael Kors says.
</P>
<P>
   American women don't like to take the extra step of getting
alterations, which can make all the difference between ``almost
fits'' and ``fits like a glove,'' Kors says. ``I think Americans
just get lazy. Even if you can't afford expensive clothes, go to
the tailor.''
</P>
<P>
   The less-is-more approach extends to a French woman's makeup,
says Laura Mercier, the Paris-born makeup artist and name on a full
line of upscale cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
   In America, she says, teenage girls dive into the world of
makeup face-first, piling on foundation and powder, blush and
beyond.

   Parisian girls, on the other hand, might use just a little
mascara or a touch of lipstick. French boys would be repelled if a
girlfriend's mug was coated in foundation, Mercier says. ``They
would say, `What is this on your face?' ''
</P>
<P>
   But more important than any number of Hermes scarves or pairs of
good shoes is a healthy sense of self.
</P>
<P>
   When Americans admire Frenchwomen, ``they're looking at the
attitude more than what they're actually wearing,'' Alan assures.
</P>
<P>
   This refrain is repeated again and again.
</P>
<P>
   ``French women have tremendous confidence,'' says Alexandra
Stoddard. ``They hold their head high. They're sassy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``French women think of clothes as accessories to a great
attitude,'' writes Veronique Vienne in French Style. ``Posture.
Poise. Presence. Put it on before you dress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not self-conscious at all,'' Alan says. ``They think
they're the biz. It's part of the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   In your impossibly tiny hotel bathroom, you practice in front of
the mirror: ``Now is the time that you must leave!'' You are
starting to get the hang of it, and all too soon it is true. Now is
the time that you must leave . . .
</P>
<P>
   You return to Miami, surrounded by shorts and sandals and
pastels. You sweat in your black turtleneck and your
two-sizes-too-big jeans, and you're the only Tri-Rail passenger
clomping around in hiking boots.
</P>
<P>
   But you wear it all proudly, because it's impossible to go to
Paris and not come back feeling like a million francs.
</P>
<P>
   When you disembark in Lake Worth, a friend is waiting. ``You
look so Continental!'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   And in the days that follow, others ask if the gray suit and
black dress you bought last year at The Gardens mall came from
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oui,'' you say with a toss of your head. ``Oui.''

CLINTON TO SEND JESSE JACKSON ON MISSION TO SIERRA LEONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to change 8,000 to 8,700 in 8th graf.)  
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Thursday that the United
States would try to help the United Nations reinforce its
peacekeeping troops in Sierra Leone and that he was sending the
Rev. Jesse Jackson to the region to see if he could help negotiate
a halt to the recent violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have asked Reverend Jesse Jackson, my special envoy for
democracy in Africa, to return to the region to work with leaders
there for a peaceful resolution of this crisis,'' Clinton said in a
statement. ``Reverend Jackson has been actively involved in our
diplomatic effort to help the people of Sierra Leone realize their
peaceful aspirations.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. peacekeepers have taken up positions to defend the capital,
Freetown, from rebel attack and apparently made some progress
Thursday, but fighting remains widespread.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton conferred Thursday morning by telephone with Kofi Annan,
the U.N. secretary-general, about American support for military
efforts in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president continued to pledge that we would do whatever we
could to support reinforcement of the mission in Sierra Leone,''
said P.J. Crowley, a White House spokesman on national security
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Crowley said the United States would remain engaged in the
conflict politically, ``and we are willing to help militarily to
help end this conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Clinton said, ``I have instructed our military
to provide needed assistance to accelerate the deployment of
troops'' to the region. Freetown has been girding for an assault by
the Revolutionary United Front.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeeping troops number about 8,700, but they are lightly
armed and did not expect to engage in combat. The troops went to
Sierra Leone to help carry out a peace agreement signed last July
between the government and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate task, administration officials said, is to get
reinforcements to Freetown who are properly equipped. The
peacekeeping operation is essentially in West African hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to support the commitment West African nations have
made to send additional troops to Sierra Leone to restore peace,''
Clinton said. ``A U.S. military team is now in Nigeria to determine
what assistance might be needed from the international community to
outfit and transport these forces as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials said they still knew little or nothing about the
whereabouts and condition of about 500 peacekeepers who were taken
hostage by rebels early last week. The taking of the peacekeepers,
most from Zambia, set off the latest crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he welcomed the statement Tuesday by West African
leaders in Abuja, Nigeria, calling for the release of all hostages
and pledging to protect democratic institutions in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Crowley said the United States would help in getting some
Jordanian troops into Sierra Leone in the next few days. He said
other contingents, including Indians and Bangladeshis, would be
arriving in the region within a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Crowley said the international commitment ``should send a clear
signal to the RUF that this mission is going to be reinforced.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.N. is serious about stabilizing the situation and
bringing additional capabilities into Sierra Leone, to try to get
Sierra Leone back towards the peace process,'' he added.

 &HT;    Braves lose 6th in past 8
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The Braves' lesson in offensive futility continues and
no pitcher is too unlikely a beneficiary. The Marlins sent
23-year-old Jason Grilli and 37-year-old Joe Strong to make their
major-league debuts for an ailing pitching staff and they came out
on top.
</P>
<P>
   They teamed up to beat Kevin Millwood and the Braves 5-4 to take
the series 3-1. The Braves lost for the sixth time in their past
eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Wait.
</P>
<P>
   Who?
</P>
<P>
   Grilli was called up from AAA Calgary to replace the injured
Alex Fernandez. He came to the Marlins from the Giants in the Livan
Hernandez trade last July. He was advertised as the Giants'
top-rated prospect for 1998 and 1999 but had done little to back it
up going 1-5 with a 7.68 ERA last year in AAA Calgary and 1-3 with
a 7.34 this year in AAA. He gave up 11 hits to the Braves in 6 2/3
innings but only four runs to outpitch Millwood, who allowed five
runs, including a two-run homer to Preston Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Strong relieved Grilli in the seventh and erased the tying runs
in the seventh and eighth innings. This right-hander has taken
journeyman to new heights, spending 11 professional seasons in
places like Mexico, Korea, Taiwan as well as the minors. He became
the oldest to make his major-league debut since left-hander
Diomedes Olivo started for the Pirates in 1960 at age 41.
</P>
<P>
   Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of the bizarre, the Marlins used a walk-off balk on
Monday, a Tom Glavine baserunning blunder on Wednesday and the
first RBI of the year for leadoff hitter Luis Castillo on Thursday
to win their first series over the Braves since July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves added to the bizarre by turning their first triple
play since 1986 to get Millwood out of a two-hit mess he left for
Greg McMichael in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   With his run-support lacking, Millwood took offensive measures
into his own hands, collecting the first two hits of his 2000
season and driving in his first two runs, but it wasn't enough. It
looked like it might be that kind of night early on after the
Braves netted only one run _ on a Brian Jordan groundout _ out of
two bases-loaded opportunities in the first two innings.
</P>
<P>
   When Chipper Jones popped out to end a bases-loaded situation in
the second inning, it was the 14th time in this series the Braves
had loaded the bases and failed to get a hit.

REPORT SAYS EPA UNDERESTIMATING EMISSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Environmental Protection Agency's computer
model for predicting how much air pollution comes from cars and
trucks underestimates emissions and may overestimate the benefits
of some pollution-control strategies, the National Academy of
Sciences said in a report on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The report did not say how far off the model is, but it said
that the model ``substantially'' underestimates emissions of
unburned fuel from cars and nitrogen oxides from trucks, both major
ingredients of smog. And the model may overestimate the value of
dashboard lights to warn of pollution control problems and of the
value of ethanol and gasoline additives intended to reduce
emissions, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decisions that rely on the results of this model are of
tremendous importance to human health, the environment and the
economy,'' the report said in explaining the value of accurate
computer predictions.
</P>
<P>
   One member of the committee that wrote the report, Dr. Laurence
S. Caretto, dean of the College of Engineering and Computer Science
at California State University at Northridge, said the
investigators questioned whether the EPA was ``looking at the right
things'' in creating a model. A more accurate model would indicate
which pollution-control strategies to pursue, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency developed the program, the Mobile Source Emissions
Factor Model, known as Mobile, in 1978 and has revised it
intermittently since then. The study said it was ``the central tool
used by environmental and transportation agencies to estimate
on-road mobile-emissions and to assess national, state and local
air-quality programs for controlling such emissions.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the agency, David Cohen, said the study was
``constructive, fair and balanced,'' and made good recommendations.
Agency officials noted that they were sometimes accused of setting
emissions rules that were too stringent, but that the study seemed
to say they might be too lax.
</P>
<P>
   The committee said the environmental agency was in the dark on
some crucial issues, like the reaction of drivers to what is
colloquially known as the ``idiot light,'' the federally required
warning light on the dashboard that illuminates when a car's
computer senses a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee is unaware of any studies conducted to assess
the motorist response to illuminated malfunction indicator lights,
although this response rate is one of the most important factors
for determining the effectiveness of on-board diagnostic systems in
reducing emissions,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, the report said, also needs to know more about
``high-emitting vehicles'' _ cars and trucks with smoking tailpipes
_ that are believed to be the source of a large portion of
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Pollution regulators should also pay more attention to off-road
sources of emissions, the report said.

DESPITE PROTESTS, METHODISTS REAFFIRM ANTI-GAY STANCE  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   By RICHARD VARA 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Delegates to the United Methodist Church's General
Conference voted 2-1 Thursday to affirm that ``homosexual practice
was incompatible with Christian teaching'' despite protests that
resulted in the arrest of 30 people, including two bishops.
</P>
<P>
   The 990 delegates to national legislative assembly meeting at
the Cleveland Convention Center also voted 2-1 to forbid the
ordaining of self-declared practicing homosexuals and banning
church blessing for same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   The impassioned debates and votes came the day after 191 gay
rights protesters, including one bishop, were arrested for blocking
a convention center roadway.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative sessions were disrupted by gay rights protesters
who marched onto the conference floor immediately after delegates
voted 628-337 to retain the current church policy that gay behavior
was not in accordance with Christian teaching. About 50 protesters
marched onto the General Conference floor and began singing We
Shall Overcome, a hymn associated with the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a weeping woman stood on a concrete ledge
overlooking the floor yelling ``I have been gay all my life.'' As
stunned delegates below scattered, people pulled her from the ledge
and she was escorted out of the center and taken away by medical
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call upon you prayerfully, our brothers and sisters to lift
the exclusionary policies of the Methodist Church and unite us as
one,'' said Randolph Miller, a protest leader from California. The
protesters were lead by AMAR, a coalition of United Methodist gay
rights groups. Miller asked for a moratorium on gay-related
exclusions in the church's Book of Discipline or church law.
</P>
<P>
   He said the protesters would not move and invited arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Dan Solomon recessed the tumultuous session for 20
minutes as he negotiated with the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a hurting situation,'' said a teary-eyed Rev. William H.
Hinson, senior minister of First United Methodist Church of
Houston, as he left the session. ``It is sad. It is tough to hold
biblical principle when people of good conscience have another
view.``
</P>
<P>
   Delegates were stunned by the actions. Several women delegates
huddled together weeping.
</P>
<P>
   But after they reconvened, delegates voted to ban the ordination
of self-declared gays to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
   During the afternoon session and after delegates voted to ban
the blessing of same-sex unions, the protesters marched onto the
platform and refused Solomon's entreaties to peacefully leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I speak with anguish in my voice for the circumstances that
are about to unfold. I bury my head in prayer,'' said a shaken
Solomon.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward about eight Cleveland police officers moved
onto the stage and arrested the protesters. The demonstrators
peacefully left the stage and were charged with disrupting a lawful
meeting, a misdemeanor. Among those arrested were Bishops C. Joseph
Sprague of Chicago and Susan Morrison of Albany, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow protesters shouted ``Shame!'' at the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel profound sadness and profound rage that the church of
Jesus Christ would exclude people in their midst,'' said Marilyn
Alexander, director of the pro-gay Reconciling Congregations
Program.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a lot of people who will leave in disgust,''
Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is extremely painful,'' said the Rev. Jimmy Creech, a
minister who was defrocked by the church for presiding at a
same-sex union. ``The church continues to persecute and oppress
gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the United Methodist Church has some severe
differences of opinion but the majority by a 2-1 margin have upheld
the tradition of the church,'' said the Rev. Scott Field,
coordinator of several conservative groups.
</P>
<P>
   But few delegates or observers thought the gay rights debate was
over for the 8.5 million member denomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not over,'' said delegate. ``I wish I could say it
was.''

 &HT;    Party of four: Avs hungriest?
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Last season, when the Detroit Red Wings had their run
of Stanley Cups smacked to a halt, Ken Holland believed he had
caught a glimpse of the NHL's new king. Now, he is sure of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Colorado beat us in the playoffs last year, I thought
they would go on to win the Cup,'' Detroit's general manager said.
``They led Dallas, 3-2, (in the Western Conference Finals) but then
it just seemed that Dallas' desire and all those intangibles made a
difference. But I'm picking Colorado again. After watching them, it
seems like they're hungrier and more desperate, and now they have
(Ray) Bourque. I think they're the best team out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The NHL's postseason continues this weekend when Dallas faces
Colorado in the opener of the Western Conference Finals on Saturday
night and Philadelphia visits New Jersey on Sunday in the East. The
focus in the East mostly is on who isn't there: the Flyers are
missing Eric Lindros and maybe Keith Primeau.
</P>
<P>
   But the NHL's playoff showcase is the West, as was expected when
the regular season ended. There is a marquee matchup in goal
(Patrick Roy vs. Ed Belfour), stars on both benches and a certain
Hall-of-Fame defenseman (Bourque) trying to win his first Cup.
</P>
<P>
   This also is a rematch of last season's Western Conference
Finals, when Colorado took a 3-2 series lead, only to get drilled
by a composite score of 8-2 in the next two games. Dallas beat
Colorado the same way it plans on beating the Avs this series _
physically. Defenseman Richard Matvichuk almost single-handedly
crippled the Colorado offense, knocking Milan Hedjuk out for the
last three games with a broken collarbone and rendering Peter
Forsberg harmless with a battered shoulder that required offseason
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Both were clean checks, but that didn't stop Colorado coach Bob
Hartley from jumpstarting a verbal battle this week, saying the hit
on Forsberg was ``an intent to injure,'' and adding, ``I'm just
sorry that Matvichuk did not get the Conn Smythe Trophy (playoff
MVP) last year. With all the destruction he did, maybe he should've
gotten the trophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Matvichuk denied he meant to injure Forsberg or Hedjuk, but
added, ``We want to make our physical presence known. That's my
job.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, who are four victories away from getting back to the
finals despite an inordinate number of injuries, realize this
Colorado team is significantly stronger than last season's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we felt like we were destined to win the Cup, the
way we came back to beat Colorado,'' Dallas center Joe Nieuwendyk
said.
</P>
<P>
   The West winner will meet the winner of the ``Jersey Turnpike
Series.'' The Devils would seem to be a heavy favorite, coming off
lopsided series victories over Florida (4-0) and Toronto (4-2) and
holding the Leafs to a record six shots in the clincher. But few
expected the Flyers to get this far without Lindros and with coach
Roger Nielson bumped to the press box after the team got hot during
his recovery from cancer surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The series is a rematch of the 1995 conference finals, when the
Devils won en route to their lone Stanley Cup. New Jersey has had a
string of playoff failures since.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of turning the page. Winning the first round was
not enough,'' goalie Martin Brodeur said.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Islamic rebels mounted a major attack outside
Chechnya's borders for the first time in nearly nine months
Thursday, all but wiping out a convoy of 22 Russian soldiers as it
moved down a mountain road in Ingushetia, a Russian region
bordering Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The mid-morning ambush of two troop trucks and an armored
vehicle in the foothills of the Caucasus Mountains killed 18
Russian Interior Ministry troops and wounded three others. One
soldier was reported missing.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said the servicemen had finished a tour of
duty in Ingushetia and were preparing to head home when the attack
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were attacked treacherously with grenade launchers by
bandits who hid in the roadside bush,'' the first deputy chief of
the Russian general staff, Col. Gen. Valery Manilov, said. ``We
hope that we will track them down and punish them for their
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian planes later bombed forests near the ambush site, north
of the village of Galashki and just a few miles from the major
government-run camps for Chechen war refugees. It was not known
whether the attackers were hit.
</P>
<P>
   With Thursday's deaths, Manilov said, 2,251 Russian servicemen
have died in the Chechen conflict, a figure some outside experts
contend is well below the true number.
</P>
<P>
   The ambush was a departure for the battered rebels, who had not
attacked Russian troops outside Chechnya's borders since the early
stages of the Chechen war in September. The war began last summer
after rebels invaded the neighboring province of Dagestan, touching
off a struggle with Russian troops along the border of the two
provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel leaders threatened on Tuesday to carry their war for
Chechen independence into nearby provinces unless Russian troops
withdraw from Chechnya by the end of May.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels' website, www.kavkaz.org, quoted the guerrilla
commander Shamil Basayev as saying that the rebels would ``declare
jihad across the whole of the Caucasus, everywhere the Russian
aggressors are.''
</P>
<P>
   The main Russian spokesman on the conflict, Sergei
Yastrzhembsky, dismissed the threat as ``mere bravado not backed by
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear if the rebels, backed into southern Chechnya's
mountains by the Russians, could widen the conflict beyond periodic
ambushes like the one Thursday. The Russian military says many
guerrillas have melted into the civilian populations of Chechnya
and Ingushetia.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, ambushes like Thursday's make it clear that
Russian forces have not restored order to the area, as spokesmen
are now claiming. The rebels have staged damaging attacks on
Russian convoys on the average of every two weeks since general
fighting ended in March, killing as many as 32 soldiers in a single
ambush.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military says it has killed about 100 rebels this
month alone.
</P>
<P>
   Manilov argued Thursday that ``despite all the difficulties and
complexities, life is returning to normal'' in Chechnya. He said
296 of the 353 schools had reopened; 37 of 60 hospitals were in
operation; and some 2,500 rebels had taken up an amnesty offer,
extended to May 15, and laid down their arms.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The subsiding of open war appears to have won over the Council
of Europe, a 41-member group that threatened to suspend Russia's
membership over human-rights violations in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The group dropped the threat Thursday at a meeting in
Strasbourg, France, after Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov argued that
Russia has established its own agency to investigate allegations of
crimes and human-rights abuses by its troops.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The council repeated its demand that Russia open talks with
Chechen representatives on a political settlement, but Manlilov and
Yastrzhembsky re-stated Thursday that that is not an option.
</P>
<P>
   The prospects for a political dialogue briefly brightened this
week after it was disclosed that the head of an independent Russian
commission looking into wartime abuses, the Russian legislator
Pavel Krasheninnikov, had met in Ingushetia with a top
representative of Chechnya's president, Aslan Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
   Krasheninnikov apparently traveled to the meeting under the
protection of Russian troops, lending the air of an official
endorsement to the session.
</P>
<P>
   But Manilov on Thursday repeated the official line on talks,
saying that the notion of negotiations with Maskhadov is
``nonsense.''

Y&AMP;R CHIEF EXPECTED TO STEP DOWN AFTER MERGER WITH WPP 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Young &AMP; Rubicam's president and chief executive, Thomas
D. Bell Jr., will most likely step down from the advertising agency
after it is acquired by WPP Group, executives close to the
negotiations said early Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Both advertising companies were working into the early morning
to formalize WPP's acquisition of Y&AMP;R, one of the last independent
advertising agencies, in hopes of formally announcing the deal
before the stock market opens in London on Friday, the executives
said.
</P>
<P>
   Y&AMP;R's annual meeting will take place Friday in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The companies agreed in principle earlier this week to merge,
although they have not announced the deal. As agreed to earlier in
the week, WPP will pay 0.835 American depository receipt for each
share of Y&AMP;R While the value of the acquisition has become a moving
target because the stocks of both companies have fluctuated, as of
Thursday the deal was worth $4.8 billion, down $900 million from
when the companies agreed in principle to the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   While Bell will play a prominent role in the integration of the
two companies by sitting on a four-person transition committee, he
has told executives he has decided to leave once the merger is
complete.
</P>
<P>
   According to executives close to the talks, Bell originally
spurned an acquisition by Martin Sorrell, WPP's chief executive,
but later decided it was strategically sound. He also declined an
offer by Y&AMP;R's board to make the acquisition conditional upon his
employment in a job of his choosing, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Several executives said that his relationship with Sorrell had
soured during the earlier negotiations but that over the last week
the two had become friendlier.
</P>
<P>
   Bell has been chief executive of Y&AMP;R only since January. Before
that, he served as chairman and chief executive of Young &AMP; Rubicam
Advertising, the company's flagship agency. &QL;

SENATE APPROVES AFRICA-CARIBBEAN TRADE BILL
</HEADLINE>
 (Repeating to add write-thru designation)  
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate decisively approved legislation on
Thursday to promote commerce with Africa and the Caribbean, ending
more than five years of defeats on trade bills for the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The 77-19 vote reflected unusual bipartisan support for a
compromise worked out by Senate and House negotiators that would
lower tariffs and quotas on products from sub-Saharan Africa, the
Caribbean and Central America.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation now goes to President Clinton, who is expected
to sign it quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the measure's provisions will not take effect for
several months, until trade officials can determine which countries
and products are eligible for new privileges.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters cheered passage of the bill as an important first
step to build broader commercial and diplomatic ties between the
United States and some of the world's most impoverished nations.
Opponents, largely from textile states in the South and New
England, warned of crippling job losses for U.S. workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing something for Africa besides sending peace forces
or aid,'' said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., one of the
bill's sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would be the first major trade measure enacted
in the United States since approval of the Uruguay Round in 1994,
which set up the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is separate from an even more contentious China
trade bill before Congress, but Clinton and other supporters of the
China bill hope that approval of the Africa-Caribbean measure will
build momentum for the larger legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The House is to vote on the China bill the week of May 22, but
the outcome is considered too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   The Africa-Caribbean compromise drew broad bipartisan support on
Thursday after months of haggling and after last rites were read
over the legislation more than once.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said the measure will help African nations diversify
their trade with the United States to include apparel and textiles,
and translate into $8 billion in new sales and 120,000 jobs for the
United States over the next five years. Oil, platinum, diamonds and
gold make up about 80 percent of current African exports to United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the House and Senate approved different versions of
the measure. Since then negotiators have sought a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Under Thursday's deal, worked out with the help of the House
Speaker, J. Dennis Hastert, and the Senate majority leader, Trent
Lott, R-Miss., the House agreed to grant many of the same duty-free
benefits to 24 Caribbean and Central American countries that 48
African nations will get.
</P>
<P>
   The House had not included the Caribbean in its legislation
because of objections from lawmakers in textile states. But
senators felt strongly about correcting an unintended consequence
of the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement, which drew much
U.S. investment to Mexico from the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the Senate dropped its insistence that duty-free
imports from Africa be made with fabric, yarn or thread from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   In a concession to textile-makers, the agreement initially caps
the volume of duty-free goods at 1.5 percent of all textile
imports. That cap rises to 3.5 percent over eight years.

EX-COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR DENIES AFFAIR WITH GIULIANI
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Nicholas Nicholas is cq.) 
(With: NY-GIULIANI, NY-GIULIANI-REACT, NY-GIULIANI-CLINTON) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cristyne Lategano-Nicholas said Thursday that she had
never had a sexual relationship with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, and
that they merely had ``a very close friendship'' during the six
years they worked side by side in City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Her remarks came a day after Donna Hanover, Giuliani's wife,
announced that his relationship with Lategano-Nicholas had damaged
their marriage. Lategano-Nicholas was the mayor's closest aide for
six years, accompanying him frequently as his press secretary and
then his communications director.
</P>
<P>
   ``What needs to be clear is that the only relationship I ever
had with the mayor was a professional one,'' Lategano-Nicholas said
in a telephone interview Thursday night from Yankee Stadium, where
she was watching a baseball game with her husband, Nicholas
Nicholas. ``There is nothing to prove other than a very close
friendship and working relationship.'' She added, ``I'm happy to
say we are still friendly with each other, although obviously I
don't see him very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanover said on Wednesday that for several years, ``it was
difficult to participate in Rudy's public life because of a
relationship with one staff member.'' Her aides later confirmed
that she was referring to Lategano-Nicholas, 35, who left City Hall
last spring.
</P>
<P>
   She was married in February to Nicholas, a golf writer.
</P>
<P>
   Lategano-Nicholas is president of NYC and Co., the city's
tourism board, a job that one former city official said was almost
certainly arranged by Giuliani. She is paid $150,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   She left City Hall last May, after taking a leave of absence to
aid her mother, who had cancer. She returned briefly in August,
when executives at the tourism bureau made clear that she was the
front-runner as soon as she asked for the job.
</P>
<P>
   One former city official familiar with Lategano-Nicholas'
performance at the tourism bureau said that Giuliani had indeed
pressured executives there to hire her. But Giuliani is also
believed to have asked them to hire her predecessor, Fran Reiter,
who was a deputy mayor before getting the tourism job in 1997. The
city provides $5.6 million of the bureau's $13.6 million annual
budget.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Giuliani and representatives of the tourism bureau
defended Lategano-Nicholas' work at the bureau, and her hiring
there. ``Cristyne Lategano was an excellent communications
director,'' Giuliani said at his daily news conference. ``And the
reality is that she's doing an excellent job now.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she feared that Hanover's statement would damage
her reputation, Lategano-Nicholas said, ``You're always concerned
about that,'' but added, ``This will pass, and my work stands for
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The former city official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said that some of the bureau's board and staff members were
initially unhappy that Lategano-Nicholas got the job. But the
official said that Lategano-Nicholas quickly won them over, in part
by working tirelessly. The official said that while people at the
tourism bureau viewed Lategano-Nicholas as a patronage employee,
they saw the situation not as ``the mayor's girlfriend being
rewarded,'' but as ``the mayor's loyal aide being rewarded.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Rubenstein, the bureau's spokesman, said Hanover's
statement would ``absolutely not'' hurt Lategano-Nicholas' career.
``She's done probably the best job in that position of any
executive they've had in recent history,'' Rubenstein said. ``She
has been very good at the trade shows and conventions. She's
strengthened the staff and they are loyal to her.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the main gallery of the American Craft Museum in
Manhattan, an airless space with room for just 300 seats, the art
world waited to see how the first major evening auction by
Phillips, the world's third-largest auction house, would fare. And
waited. And waited.
</P>
<P>
   The auction began nearly an hour late, and then it started with
an announcement that 3 percent of the hammer prices would go to the
American Foundation for AIDS Research. Dressed in a bright orange
dress with matching lipstick, the movie star Sharon Stone, campaign
chairwoman for the charity, made a speech about AIDS. Throughout
the evening, she wandered up and down the aisles trying to drum up
excitement in the otherwise dead room.
</P>
<P>
   Was this a charity auction or a sale of serious art? several
people in the audience asked. It quickly became apparent that even
limitless pots of money can't buy a respected place in the art
world.
</P>
<P>
   The auction was not only Phillips' first time selling
multimillion-dollar Impressionist and modern art in a big evening
sale, but also its first sale since LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis
Vuitton bought the company in October. The parent company's
chairman, Bernard Arnault, had spent million of dollars trying to
make Phillips a major player in an unforgiving art world.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of the works went unsold. Of the 31 offered,
only 18 sold, and of those only 4 were within or above their
estimates. The sale totaled $43.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward Arnault was upbeat about the results. ``It's the
largest sale ever for Phillips,'' he said. ``This is a good first
step. We are here for the long term, and we will make this work.
Today is a start.''
</P>
<P>
   To compete with Sotheby's and Christie's, LVMH had given sellers
some kind of financing for 30 of the 31 works offered Thursday
night, reportedly an investment of $100 million. In some cases
Phillips gave sellers a straight guarantee (an undisclosed minimum
price given to the seller regardless of a sale's outcome), an
advance, a loan or a combination of the three. Often, experts at
competing auction houses said, Arnault had paid more for the works
than their estimates reflected.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do is not different from the others,'' Arnault said
when asked about the financial arrangements he made with sellers.
</P>
<P>
   He also spent well over $1 million renting and renovating the
American Craft Museum, just four blocks from Christie's and across
the street from the Museum of Modern Art, for the sale. Phillips'
New York headquarters on East 79th Street was too small to
accommodate the curious crowd of several hundred.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the catalog was circulated to collectors last month,
the sale had been the talk of the art world. The estimates were too
high, experts said. All the negative talk affected the reaction
last night. With only a few exceptions, bidding was thin and most
often by unidentified telephone bidders.
</P>
<P>
   The final work in the sale was the most important: Malevich's
``Suprematist Composition,'' an austere abstract painting that hung
in the Museum of Modern Art until recently. Before the sale, the
painting was placed on an easel in the front of the room shrouded
by a black velvet cloth, which Stone dramatically removed when the
bidding began. But even that didn't help generate excitement. Only
two telephone bidders went for the painting, which finally sold for
$17 million. Phillips had refused to estimate the selling price,
but LVMH had reportedly bought the painting for $15 million.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Malevich's 31 heirs won a claim to get the painting back last
year, and they consigned it to Phillips to sell. While the auction
house says the painting dates from 1919, curators at the museum say
it was painted later, from 1923 to 1925. The difference in dating
is important, experts say: if it was made in 1919, it is far more
valuable.
</P>
<P>
   The other 30 works in the sale were a mixed bag, dominated by a
group of paintings that an unidentified Japanese collector bought
for high prices during the 1980s art market boom. The Wildenstein
Gallery represented the Japanese seller. Both Sotheby's and
Christie's made a play for the works, but no one was willing to pay
the $27 million that Phillips reportedly spent. The group included
works by Monet, Cezanne, Pissarro and Vuillard.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few popular works Thursday night, part of the
collection from Japan, was Sisley's ``Garden at Louveciennes (Path
to l'Etarche)'' from 1873, a lush landscape. It finally sold to an
unidentified telephone bidder for $3.5 million, double its high
estimate of $1.5 million. Picasso's ``Sleeping Nude and Woman
Washing Her Feet'' (1944) had three bidders and ended up bringing
$4.4 million, just above its $4 million high estimate.
</P>
<P>
   But a majority of works that sold went for far less than
Phillips had estimated. Take Cezanne's ``View of Gardanne,'' a
landscape from 1886-90 that was expected to bring $6 million to $8
million. Only one bidder wanted it, and it sold for $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Many drew no interest at all. Monet's ``Seine Near Bougival''
(1872) came with an estimate of $5 million to $6 million. Bidding
started at $3 million and never went higher than $3.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Another seller last night was the Nahmads, a family of Lebanese
dealers with galleries in New York and London who have been among
the biggest buyers at Sotheby's and Christie's for the last decade.
An 1898 Renoir, ``The Loge at the Theatre des Varietes,'' one of
the artist's loge scenes, was expected to sell for $5 million to $7
million. There were no bids.
</P>
<P>
   (Final prices include Phillips' commission, 15 percent of the
first $50,000 and 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect
commissions.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the sale, dealers and collectors milled outside the
museum, gossiping about the evening's outcome. ``I felt sorry for
them, but it was the worst combination,'' said Alexander Apsis, the
former head of Impressionist and modern art for Sotheby's in New
York, who is now a partner of C&AMP;M Arts, a Manhattan gallery. ``When
you have not-great paintings and estimates that are too high, you
can't help but get killed.'' &QL;

   McCAIN RESPONDS TO SUPPORTERS ABOUT BUSH
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., are inundating him with
hundreds of e-mail messages and telephone calls complaining about
his endorsement of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas for the Republican
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has responded with an e-mail message of his own, sent to
120,000 supporters on his campaign list, that recalled that he had
promised at the start of his campaign to support the eventual
Republican nominee and that he always makes good on his promises.
In any event, the message continued, Bush is now ``our best hope''
to oust the Democrats from the White House. ``To those who I have
disappointed,'' McCain wrote, ``let me simply reiterate that I will
never give up my fight for real government reform.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Bush, he said, still have ``a few principled
disagreements,'' but he did not elaborate. McCain aides said the
senator expected complaints about his endorsement but went ahead
because breaking a promise would not only have tarnished his
straight-talking image but also have made him appear a poor loser
and a less-than-faithful Republican, should he ever seek the
presidency again.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH COMMENTS ON 2 POSSIBLE RUNNING MATES
</P>
<P>
   When Gov. George W. Bush of Texas was asked about vice
presidential candidates in an interview with the Lifetime women's
cable channel Thursday, he had notably different reactions to two
names, suggesting that he was concerned about appearing too open to
the idea of a running mate who strongly supports abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Elizabeth Dole, an opponent of abortion, was on his
list, he said that she was and then praised her as ``a good friend
of mine who has had a great career.''
</P>
<P>
   But when asked about Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey, who
supports abortion rights and whose selection would undoubtedly
provoke many religious conservatives, Bush's response seemed
conspicuously restrained. ``There's a lot of people on the list,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER SURVEY SHOWS A STRONG BUSH LEAD
</P>
<P>
   For the second time this week, a national presidential
preference poll has Gov. George W. Bush leading Vice President Al
Gore by at least half a dozen percentage points. The newest survey,
released Thursday by the Voter.com group, puts Bush ahead by 48
percent to 42 percent. A poll released on Wednesday by The Los
Angeles Times had Bush ahead by eight percentage points. Like the
Times poll, the Voter.com poll found Bush now pulling about as much
of the female vote as Gore, though that voting segment has
traditionally leaned heavily to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Bush continues to lead among men, and he has moved ahead in the
struggle for independents, a toss-up earlier. The Voter.com poll
also found Bush leading among Democrats who had supported Ronald
Reagan and also found that half of all voters had grown pessimistic
about the state of the nation and its direction, despite the strong
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to rank top issues for Congress, voters most often
mentioned ``restoring moral values,'' followed by education. They
said Republicans would be best at restoring moral values _ 6 in 10
disapproved of President Clinton ``as a person'' _ but believed
Democrats would do more for education. The poll surveyed 1,000
likely voters from May 1 to May 3 and had a margin of sampling
error of plus or minus three percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   GORE MAKES MOST OF WASHINGTON CONNECTIONS
</P>
<P>
   Many are the perks of being vice president, particularly when
you are running for president. Al Gore demonstrated that anew this
week, first by handing out what his office called ``deliverables''
_ more than $25 million in grants to expand tourism and businesses
in the financially struggling Mississippi Delta _ and then by
announcing ``improvements'' in veterans' education benefits worth
$1.2 billion over five years. (Never mind that the money will come
from savings in other veterans' programs.)
</P>
<P>
   Gore boasted that the improvements were ``the single largest
increase in veterans' education benefits'' in more than 15 years.
Gov. George W. Bush said that Gore was being hypocritical because
the Clinton administration had earlier proposed sharp cuts in
veterans' benefits.
</P>
<P>
   WEDNESDAY'S SCHEDULES:
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE W. BUSH: Austin, Texas &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AL GORE: Burbank, Calif., and Portland, Ore.

PSYCHIATRIST SAYS RAILYARD SUSPECT THOUGHT VICTIM LOOKED LIKE AN

<P>
   HOUSTON _ A defense psychiatrist testified Thursday that Angel
Maturino Resendiz at first thought his victim looked like a
beautiful angel as she slept, but after he found signs of evil in
her house God told him to kill her.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn to the suburban West University Place home by ``evil
forces,'' he found in the study of Dr. Claudia Benton, a pediatric
geneticist, pictures of children with birth defects and an African
carving he thought depicted an evil deity who persecuted Jews, Dr.
Bruce Cohen testified.
</P>
<P>
   During the second day of defense testimony in Maturino
Resendiz's capital murder trial, his mother, Virginia Maturino
Resendiz, testified that she had given birth standing up and her
newborn son fell on his head. He also suffered several blows to the
head growing up and witnessed her being attacked by a man wielding
a machete, she said.

   Other family members testified that as a child Maturino Resendiz
was sexually abused by a stranger.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen described the Mexican national as a paranoid
schizophrenic, a condition that had been caused by a combination of
head injuries, drug abuse and a family history of mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   The defense is trying to prove those traumas led to a diminished
mental state that ultimately sent him on a mission to destroy
``evil people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time of that offense, as a result of schizophrenia, he
did not know that his conduct was wrong,'' Cohen testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to this day I don't feel guilty,'' Maturino Resendiz told
Cohen. ``I feel for the families, but I will tell you I feel like
somebody else did it and not me. ... I know it was me, but I can't
point the finger and say it was me. ... I know the jury won't like
hearing this, but how can I feel sorry for evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz, 40, is charged with the December 1998 slaying
and rape of Benton, one of six Texans he has admitted to killing,
as well as two others in Illinois and one more in Kentucky over a
two-year period.
</P>
<P>
   The self-described ``half angel, half man'' has pleaded not
guilty by reason of insanity, claiming God had told him to destroy
abortion clinics, but along the way an evil presence led him to
kill at random.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, he would &UR;  &LR; get the death penalty or life in prison.
Under Texas law, jurors can only find an accused person legally
insane if they believe he suffered a severe mental disorder and
could not tell right from wrong at the time of the offense.
</P>
<P>
   The state has rested its case linking Maturino Resendiz to the
Benton death through fingerprints, DNA and stolen items recovered
from his home in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said Maturino Resendiz is an organized, higher-functioning
schizophrenic able to carry out his delusions by stowing away on
freight trains to move from town to town looking for abortion
clinics. At each city he spent the day searching for clinics and at
night tried to find a place to sleep near the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   That's what he was doing the night he attacked Benton, Cohen
said. He was particularly drawn to Houston, which he called Sodom.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz was diverted that night by a sudden feeling
that he should walk along the railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then I found the doctor's place,'' Cohen testified
Maturino Resendiz told him during 19 hours of examinations, and a
``cold chill'' filled his head. Earlier witnesses testified he
forced the garage door open and entered the home from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something told me to go in and led me to the computer room and
I saw the evil pictures of experiments she was doing on babies,''
Maturino Resendiz told Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Benton did no such experiments. She was preparing a report on
her work on Angelman syndrome, a condition that causes retardation,
and had left her computer on when she went to bed.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said Maturino Resendiz then returned to the bedroom,
bludgeoned her head with a bronze statute, turned her body face
down on the floor and wrapped her head in a plastic bag to try to
make her look like a blonde angel.
</P>
<P>
   As she lay dying, he raped her.
</P>
<P>
   In a move by the defense that backfired, lawyers for Maturino
Resendiz called his sister, Manuela Maturino Karkiewicz, in an
attempt to establish that Texas Ranger Drew Carter had tricked her
into helping persuade her brother to surrender by not discussing
the possibility he would get the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who took Maturino Resendiz into custody in July at the
Mexico-Texas border, earlier testified that he had expressly told
her that death was an option.
</P>
<P>
   During defense questioning, Karkiewicz said Carter only
guaranteed that the family would be allowed to visit her brother in
jail and he would receive psychiatric help.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Allen Tanner has said the family's demand of
``humane'' treatment meant he would not be put to death. Karkiewicz
denied she had ever discussed the death penalty with Carter.
</P>
<P>
   But under cross-examination by prosecutor Devon Anderson,
Karkiewicz admitted she had asked Carter about the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson asked if it were true she had asked if she was eligible
for any reward money.
</P>
<P>
   Karkiewicz adamantly denied it, even when Anderson produced a
certified letter addressed to the sister stating that she had
helped in the capture of her brother.
</P>
<P>
   Karkiewicz said Carter had told her she would need the letter if
she wanted to use the money for her brother's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the ones that told me about it, but I never asked
for the money,'' Karkiewicz said
</P>
<P>
   ``But you took the money, ma'am,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' the sister responded quietly.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much was it,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty-six,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty-six thousand dollars?'' Anderson asked. ``How much of
that has been used for the defense of your brother?''
</P>
<P>
   ``None,'' Karkiewicz said.
</P>

 MERRILL LYNCH INVESTING IN NEEDY AREAS  &HT;     By CHRONICLE STAFF

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Investment giant Merrill Lynch said Thursday
that it will invest $159 million in low-income neighborhoods in
California during the next three years in partnership with
Greenlining Institute, a San Francisco community activist group.
</P>
<P>
   Greenlining will be Merrill's liaison to community groups and
advise the brokerage as it builds its low-income lending operation.
</P>
<P>
   The program earmarks $120 million for small-business lending,
$15 million for affordable housing, $16 million for recruiting
financial advisers from minority communities and $8 million for
supporting businesses and nonprofit groups in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative is an expansion of a program Merrill started in
Southern California in 1996, shortly after Orange County went
through one of the highest-profile local-government bankruptcies in
recent U.S. history. The county cut services in low-income
neighborhoods after it went broke.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill, which had been an underwriter of the county's bonds,
responded with a $77 million investment program in Orange and Los
Angeles counties. In addition to its brokerage business, the firm
is a major small-business lender.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law requires banks to provide credit to all communities,
and banks have long sponsored programs to offer banking services in
low-income neighborhoods. But brokerages have been exempt from such
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time a brokerage house has made this kind of
commitment to inner cities in California, in cooperation with
community groups,'' said Bob Gnaizda, the Greenlining policy
director.

</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For a few hours Thursday night, the Internet
industry forgot its recent worries about falling stock prices and
nonexistent profits to congratulate itself on a job well done.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives and designers gathered at the Masonic
Auditorium on Nob Hill in San Francisco for the 4th Annual Webby
Awards, a celebration in the tradition of the Oscars that honors
the world's best Web sites in 27 categories.
</P>
<P>
   The awards have become increasingly popular as a measure of
quality and as a source of bragging rights, especially in the Bay
Area, considered the capital of the technology industry. The rapid
growth of the Internet has propelled the Webbys from its modest
birth in a San Francisco nightclub to Thursday night's extravagant,
Hollywood-style event.
</P>
<P>
   Creating a veneer of prestige was clearly a goal of the event's
organizers. Guests entered the auditorium on a red carpet patrolled
by paparazzi, actually actors paid to shout questions and use flash
cameras that had no film.
</P>
<P>
   The event itself had some more authentic Hollywood touches. Alan
Cumming, the Tony Award winning actor who has appeared in films
like ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' was the master of ceremonies, while
actress Sandra Bernhard and Talk magazine editor Tina Brown
presented awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think awards shows in general fulfill this primal need in
people to seek validation,'' said Tiffany Shlain, the event's
founder and director. ``And really, the Webby Awards are a large
dramatic way of saying `Good job.'''
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case throughout the Webbys' short history,
invitations were difficult to come by. Signaling how much the
Internet industry covets awards, or simply how much it enjoys a
night out, Shlain said that ticket demand exceeded the venue's
2,400-seat capacity by at least a factor of two or three.
</P>
<P>
   The Webby ceremony was a mixture of tribute, irreverence, satire
and multimedia spectacle that mimicked the tenor of the Internet.
Event organizers called it an ``antidote to the Oscars,'' and in
many ways that was true.
</P>
<P>
   As has been the Webbys' hallmark, victory speeches were limited
to five words. However, the winners still managed to include some
whimsical phrasing that made the audience laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Award presentations were juggled between animated film clips,
live music and special effects. The hall was decorated to the theme
of H.G. Wells' ``The Time Machine,'' which meant futuristic decor
like a round movie screen and flashing lights.
</P>
<P>
   Categories included arts, commerce, games, humor and kids.
Judging was done by 270 members of the International Academy of
Digital Arts and Sciences, a group that describes itself as
encouraging the ``progress of new media,'' and includes celebrities
such as actor Robin Williams and musician David Bowie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, it wasn't very difficult for me to choose a
winner,'' said Deepak Chopra, the spiritual adviser and author who
was a judge in the health category but did not attend the ceremony.
``I think the Webbys are a good way to get people interested in the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, representatives from the Webby-nominated sites
were pleased at being part of the competition. Their sentiments
ranged from pride at the recognition to the expectation of free
publicity and its residual riches.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge validation,'' said Thomas Hale, chief executive
of  &LR; WiredPlanet.com,  &LR; a music Web site based in San Francisco.
``There are thousands of music sites out there and being picked
among the top five is key.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Rinella, vice president and general manager of
 &LR; bluemountain.com,  &LR; a Redwood City, Calif., greeting card Web site
that was nominated in the living category, said that the
competition puts a deserved spotlight on his Web designers and
programmers, who usually ``get recognition only when something goes
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Others had a more understated view of the event and downplayed
its significance. Michael Gough, chief creative officer for
Quokka.com, a San Francisco site that was nominated in the sports
category, debated whether to wear jeans or a tuxedo to the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the Oscars or the Emmys,'' said Gough, who decided to
wear jeans. ``But then again, we're not nominated for an Oscar or
Emmy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some categories featured relatively unknown Internet sites
rather than the multimillion dollar companies that can afford to
build fancy ones. In many cases, the operators of those small sites
had no idea how they got nominated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to get all dressed up and go to some fancy
shindig,'' said Jason Kottke, a Web designer from Minneapolis,
whose online diary,  &LR; kottke.org &LR; , was up for an award in the
personal category. ``It's an excuse to go to San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   One early winner was Entropy8Zuper, a graphics-intensive Web
site ( &LR; www.entropy8zuper.org &LR; ) operated by Michael Samyn, of
Belgium, and Auriea Harvey, an American living in Belgium. It won
the inaugural SFMOMA Webby Prize for Excellence in Online Art, run
in conjunction with the Webbys and the San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the other Webby awards, the winners of this prize
received $30,000. The judging was also different in that it was
based on a body on work rather than a single Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The Webby ceremony was preceded by a party at Grace Cathedral
that featured ``cyber angels,'' acrobats that appeared to dangle in
the air inside the church. A party after the ceremony was held in
the cathedral's plaza and in a tent at nearby Huntington Park.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the event's satirical edge, the Webbys hired
people to roam the festivities and fuss over guests to make them
feel important. But what got much of the attention were some of the
outrageously dressed guests, including ones wearing silver insect
wings and space suits.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the buzz around the Webbys, it is difficult to
measure what winning one means. Some Webby-winning sites report a
surge in visitors, while others say the benefits are unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, companies try to capitalize on the event as much
as they can, judging from the number of them that issued press
releases touting their nominations. Many nominees also placed the
Webby emblem on their Internet sites and encouraged their users to
vote for them in the Webby's popularity competition, the People's
Voice.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest beneficiary of the Webbys are the Webbys
themselves, which are owned by IDG, a technology market research
company in Framingham, Mass., that publishes the ``... for
Dummies'' series of books. The event has grown dramatically from
its first year in 1997, when it was held at Bimbo's nightclub in
North Beach and one of the categories was devoted to pornography,
an award that has since been discontinued.

NET WORTH: BAY AREA HOME BUYERS MAY GET A BREAK AS
INVENTORIES  RISE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By KATHLEEN PENDER 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Now that the tech-stock bubble has burst, can
the Bay Area's overinflated real estate market be far behind?
</P>
<P>
   Some agents say that in the past few weeks, insanity seems to
have slipped out of the housing market, particularly at the higher
end, and particularly in Silicon Valley, which in the late 1990s
led the Bay Area out of its real estate slump.
</P>
<P>
   The signs (don't laugh): Some houses are staying on the market
more than a week, attracting only a handful of offers, and selling
at their asking prices.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons (from Econ 101): Supply is growing and demand is
slipping.
</P>
<P>
   The number of homes for sale is increasing, partly because this
is the peak selling season, but also because many people saw their
neighbors' homes fetch unimaginable prices and decided to fling
their own houses onto the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of greedy sellers,'' says Lauren Lai, a broker
with Coldwell Banker in San Francisco. ``They say, `Put it out
there and see what happens.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Nasdaq's 30-percent plunge since March 10 has
driven some buyers out of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Nina Hatvany, a broker with TRI/Coldwell Banker, says that on
the Sunday before last, there were three homes in San Francisco
ranging from $700,000 to $800,000 that were back on the market
after pending sales fell through. She heard the deals unraveled
because of the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Lai had listed one of the homes, on Turk Street. She confirmed
that the buyer dropped out because his stock portfolio got hit and
he had trouble selling his own house. She said a new offer has been
accepted on the house that is ``comparable'' to the first one.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they haven't lost money in the stock market, some buyers
have retreated to the sidelines because they're tired of losing out
in bidding wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had folks who've said, `I'd like to stand back from the
market for a while. I'm exhausted. I'm beat up. I'm taking a
rest,''' says Susan Peterson, a broker with Pacific Union in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson says the market is not heading south, it's just
``leveling off.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty Weeks, a broker with Coldwell Banker in Silicon Valley,
has a different opinion. ``I think the bubble has burst,'' she
says. ``There are 66 houses on the market in San Mateo right now.
That is roughly three times what we were seeing earlier in the
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Weeks says she welcomes the change. The market got so nutty that
her company recently started requiring buyers to sign a two-page
disclosure statement that basically says, ``I know I'm paying too
much money for this house but I'm doing it anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Carole Rodoni, president of Alain Pinel Realtors in Saratoga,
Calif., concurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very good correction,'' she says. ``Buyers will have
more choices. Where there used to be seven, eight or nine houses on
tour in Palo Alto, now you'll see 30.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, ``We have seen the number of multiple offers come
down. Where there were 17 or 18, now you see three or four.''
Rodoni predicts that ``rapid appreciation will become more mild
appreciation.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, there are no statistics that suggest a slowdown. Neither
DataQuick nor the California Association of Realtors have released
their April figures for Bay Area home sales and prices.
</P>
<P>
   So I called the individual real estate associations for San
Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Alameda, Contra Costa and Marin
counties and got data on prices, days on market, inventory and
sales for the past three months.
</P>
<P>
   These figures are not always complete or comparable.
Nevertheless, they show that homes continued to sell faster in
April, and for more money, and even though inventories grew from
March, there were still fewer homes on the market last month than
there were in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But agents point out April sales were usually started in March _
before the worst of the Nasdaq crash. Furthermore, they say that if
there is a slowdown, it only started a couple weeks ago and won't
show up in the numbers until May or June.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the next two weeks will be a good indicator'' of where
the market is going, says Monica Rohrer, a broker who works in
Oakland and Berkeley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the market stalls, no one is predicting a crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a very, very active market,'' says Rodoni.``It's
not a market in stress, in the toilet, or a market that has gone
down the drain.''
</P>
<P>
   For every sale that has fallen apart, agents can name at least
one that has far exceeded the asking price.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not seeing any of the indications we typically see when
the market starts to level out or dry up,'' says John Karevoll of
DataQuick, which tracks home sales.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side (if you're a seller), there is still pent-up
demand from people who desperately need a place to live. The Bay
Area unemployment rate is below 3 percent, and the number of jobs
created has far exceeded the number of homes built.
</P>
<P>
   People who are sitting on stock options that have suddenly
become worthless probably can't buy the house of their dreams. But
plenty of people with good-paying jobs can still afford a house,
especially if they're not competing against instant millionaires
who might come in with a bid 25 percent above asking price.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Bruzzone is a broker with Security Pacific who operates in
Marin and the Oakland-to-Richmond, Calif. corridor.
</P>
<P>
   Although Marin may have cooled off a degree or two, ``in
Richmond and Oakland, there's absolutely no slowdown. There are 20
to 30 offers on every house. But the houses cost $200,000,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dot-com bubble bursting has had zero impact on houses
under $400,000.'' The only way that market will be hurt is ``if
there was another 20 percent drop (in the Nasdaq index) and the
people who have a bunch of money stop employing the people who are
buying under-$400,000 houses.''
</P>
<P>
   But some experts think there is a very real chance of that
happening. John Goode, chief investment office with Davis Skaggs
Investment Management, cautions that a gargantuan amount of stock
could flood the market in the next few months as ``lockup'' periods
expire.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, when a company goes public, its employees, venture
capitalists and other insiders can't unload their stock for six
months. When this period ends, the number of shares these investors
can sell might be many times greater than the amount sold in the
IPO.
</P>
<P>
   Although few companies have gone public since March, a huge
number went public in the previous 12 months. And many analysts
believe that the enormous supply of stock coming from those
companies has hurt the market and will continue to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Goode thinks that banks will be less willing to approve home
loans that are based on stock options or locked stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who says the real estate market is independent of the
stock market is wrong,'' says Goode. ``A year from now, the real
estate market will be a far different place than it is today.
Things will take longer to sell. Probably you'll be dealing with
discounts from asking prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Buyers who wait, however, may face even bigger payments if the
Fed continues to raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, mortgage rates have risen by more than one
percentage point, according to Jann Van Heuver, senior loan
consultant with Advantage Financial in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is now around 8.5
percent for a loan under $240,000 and 8.75 percent for a loan over
that amount, she says. Both loans require payment of one point, or
1 percent of the loan amount.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens to rates or prices, Jeannette Fung says
she's never getting back into the fray.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Fung and her family, who owned a nice home in San
Francisco west of Twin Peaks, started house hunting on the
Peninsula. They wanted to escape the fog and find a better school
for their 6-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the biggest shock of our lives,'' she says. ``We bid on
a lot in Redwood City. The guy wanted $750,000. He wanted us to
close in a week, with no due diligence.'' They lost the lot to
someone who was willing to buy without an inspection.
</P>
<P>
   They were one of 11 bidders on a 2,200-square-foot house in
Millbrae that was listed at $695,000. ``It went for $812,000,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   After that, they dropped out of the market and found a new
school for their son in the city. Today, Fung says she has no
desire to get back into the market, even if prices decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1990, we had a similar kind of superheated market. My
brother and I paid $400,000 for a two-unit place in Duboce
Triangle. We put $100,000 into rehabbing it.'' But her brother got
sick and they were forced to sell in 1996. They got $450,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember that lesson now,'' she says.

 EXCITEATHOME EXODUS GROWS  &HT;     By TODD WALLACK 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The resignations continue to pile up at
ExciteAtHome.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Fred Siegel, senior vice
president of marketing, plans to quit next month to spend more time
with his family in Philadelphia, the fourth notable departure at
the Redwood City, Calif., Internet company in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel, 46, a former QVC marketing executive, joined Excite two
years ago before the portal merged with AtHome, the country's
biggest provider of cable modem service.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel's resignation comes just days after former Chief
Executive Officer Tom Jermoluk stepped down as chairman, taking a
job with venture capital firm Kleiner, Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers.
George Bell, a onetime documentary filmmaker who become chief
executive of ExciteAtHome in January, took his place.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Adam Grosser, president of subscriber networks,
resigned two weeks ago, and David Pine, the company's top lawyer,
is leaving in June to join Handspring, a competitor to 3Com's Palm
spin-off. Both resignations became public two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bell is building his own team,'' said Abhishek Gami, a
financial analyst with William Blair &AMP; Co. in Chicago, who
predicted in an interview Monday: ``We are going to hear about more
management defections.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the change in CEOs, analysts cited other reasons
for the turnover.
</P>
<P>
   ExciteAtHome's stock has slipped 76 percent over the past 12
months, worse than most of its rivals. Yahoo is up 44 percent,
Lycos is up 9 percent and America Online has fallen 24 percent
during that span. ExciteAtHome shares edged up 13 cents yesterday
to $19.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the company reorganized its divisions last month and
shifted its priorities.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the company scrapped plans to break into the black
this year so it could spend more money signing up customers and
building the infrastructure to support them.
</P>
<P>
   Bell told analysts last month that he hopes to sign 3 million
cable modem customers by year's end, up from 1.5 million at the end
of March. ``The best thing we can do is be in heavy growth mode,''
Bell told analysts in a conference call.
</P>
<P>
   Although some stock watchers said the decision makes some sense
in the long term, it could hurt ExciteAtHome's short-term stock
price (and the value of executives' stock option packages), as
investors begin paying more attention to Net firms' bottom lines.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T also announced plans in March to take control of the firm,
buying out partners Comcast and Cox Communications for as much as
$3 billion. Zona Research analyst Harry Fenik said AT&AMP;T's large
bureaucracy could make it harder for ExciteAtHome executives to get
swift approval for decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a senior executive at a place like ExciteAtHome is not
all that pleasant when you have a parent like Ma Bell,'' Fenik
said. ``It's a lot harder to accomplish anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But ExciteAtHome spokeswoman Melissa Walia pointed out that
turnover is common at Internet companies. Several of the executives
left after joining AtHome shortly after it was founded in 1995.
``Four years is a long time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the resignations, two people close to the company
said Dean Gilbert, chairman of the company's AtHome Solutions
subsidiary, has scaled back his work hours because of an illness in
his family. But company spokeswoman Alison Bowman insisted he had
no plans to leave. ``He is firmly in place at this company,'' she
said.

 GAMERS SHOOT FOR THE NET  &HT;     By KELLY ZITO 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A more optimistic video-games industry emerged
Thursday from the shadows cast by the post-Columbine
finger-pointing, as hardware- and software-makers looked toward a
new generation of consoles to become the hub of home entertainment
in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   While last year's Electronic Entertainment Expo keynote speaker
fielded questions about the industry's role in the deadly
Littleton, Colo., high school shooting after it was revealed that
the two teens responsible played violent video games like Doom and
Quake, the kickoff presentations at this year's conference focused
on both the promise and problems raised by the Internet and other
cutting-edge technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year it seemed video games were being blamed for
everything wrong with today's youth,'' Doug Lowenstein, president
of the Interactive Digital Software Association, a Washington,
D.C., industry trade group, told roughly 200 attendees. Unbowed by
criticism, however, the industry ``is stronger than ever before and
refocused not on peripheral issues but on computer and video games
both as they are and on what they are becoming.''
</P>
<P>
   Although last year's $6.1 billion in game software sales didn't
surpass movie ticket sales _ as many had projected _ Lowenstein
said it will happen soon, as more consumers move away from
``passive'' forms of entertainment like radio and films and toward
the ``immersive,'' ``emotional'' world of games.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that will depend on the rise of online gaming and the
slew of next generation, Internet-connected consoles scheduled to
hit store shelves during the next two years. Sony's
much-anticipated PlayStation2 will premiere in the United States in
October. And both Microsoft's X-Box and Nintendo's Dolphin machines
are scheduled for a 2001 release.
</P>
<P>
   The graphics improvements embodied in those consoles _ evidenced
by a video showing the evolution from Pong, circa 1978, to today's
almost photo-realistic Final Fantasy series _ is winning over a
growing number of ``casual gamers'' who play a couple of hours a
week.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, many believe those machines' decidedly
un-consolelike features _ PlayStation2 doubles as a DVD player and
the X-Box will have a hard drive _ will determine the look of home
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Consoles are becoming the fifth box after the television,
personal computer, stereo and telephone, said Bob Pittman,
president of America Online.
</P>
<P>
   And just as the ``Internet is becoming central to everyday life,
playing games is developing into an everyday online activity,'' he
said. ``We're beginning to see numbers that say this isn't a fad,
it's a way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   However, even the most enthusiastic still hedge their bets when
it comes to online gaming, which was responsible for about $500
million in sales last year, according to the IDSA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any question that online games will
fundamentally realign the world of interactive entertainment in the
future,'' Lowenstein said in a recent interview. ``The $64 million
question now is when. Until we get some broadband in a critical
mass of homes, I think the growth of online games will continue to
be steady, but modest.''
</P>
<P>
   Online games, in which people can play other humans _ rather
than the artificial intelligence of a software program _ over the
Internet, has long been trumpeted as the Next Big Thing in gaming.
One of the most successful online titles is Sony's EverQuest, the
role-playing adventure game that boasts 210,000 active users who
pay $10 a month to play it.
</P>
<P>
   But that's still a relatively thin slice of the game market.
Internet games will probably only spread as far as broadband _ DSL
or cable modem _ does. And so far, the numbers don't look
promising.
</P>
<P>
   Technology research firm Cahners In-Stat predicts that there
will be 9 million broadband users by end of this year in United
States. And though that number is forecast to swell to 49 million
by 2003, it's still well below the number of narrowband users.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, companies like San Francisco's Zupit.com are
creating Web sites where people with 56K modems can access chunks
of a game rather than spending two hours to download the whole
thing.
</P>
<P>
   The other sticky issue, as with all things Web related, is
money.
</P>
<P>
   EverQuest's model has worked. But the industry will be watching
the fate of more mainstream companies like AOL and Redwood City,
Calif.'s Electronic Arts, which just signed a deal in which EA will
provide the content for AOL's game channel.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter Luisi, product manager for EverQuest, says that all games
will rise or fall on their ability to tap into one simple human
trait: socializing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When games first came out, there was just a single player,
where you're playing with the artificial intelligence of the
game,'' he said. ``Then it was two person _ now you don't see games
without two-player mode. In the future, you won't see a game
without an online component. No matter what kind of AI is in the
game, people are smarter than games, and people like playing
against other people.''

 TECH LINK PLANNED AT WELLS

   &UR; c. 2000 the San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Wells Fargo will unveil next week a series of
partnerships with Internet companies that will provide technology
and content for the bank's new Web site for small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the San Francisco bank said that joining forces
with the seven Internet companies allows them to put together
rapidly a broad package of products and services for businesses.
These include features that have little to do with banking, such as
news and marketing software.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Internet economy, there is no way we could have moved
fast enough on our own,'' said Mark Baumli, vice president in
Wells' business Internet services unit.
</P>
<P>
   Such partnerships between established companies and Web-based
startups have become a staple feature of the Internet economy.
Established companies like Wells bring their millions of customers
to the relationships, while Web companies offer cutting-edge
technology plus online savvy.
</P>
<P>
   ``These upstart companies are not getting the brand recognition
they hoped for and they are running out of money,'' said Sutro &AMP;
Co. analyst Campbell Chaney. ``Now they are looking for strategic
partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells has more than 1 million small-business customers and is
the nation's largest lender to the sector, according to some
surveys.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's partners include DigitalWork.com, a Chicago provider
of online materials in such areas as marketing and human resources,
and NetSales, a Kansas company that sells resources for setting up
online stores. The two partners will charge Wells' customers fees
for using their products, splitting revenue with the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Other partners are Accrue Software, which will track customer
data for Wells, and Art Technology Group, which will provide its
Dynamo design tools that will allow the bank to customize its Web
site for individual customers.
</P>
<P>
   Three other companies will provide online tools and content for
Wells' small-business customers. Signio will offer online payment
processing tools; Vicinity will provide mapping and directory
services; and iSyndicate will offer news, stock quotes and other
online content.
</P>
<P>
   While Wells is a leader in Internet banking for consumers, it is
behind such rivals as Bank of America, Citibank, American Express
and financial softwaremaker Intuit in using the Web to reach
small-business customers.
</P>
<P>
   The bank presently offers several Web-based small-business
services, including access to NetSales' online sales materials. It
also provides account information over the Internet. But Wells
hasn't had an integrated small-business Internet package that
includes a variety of account-management features.
</P>
<P>
   The service Wells will begin offering next week will combine
basic banking services, such as electronic bill payment, with the
business resources provided by the bank's partners. Most online
banking services will be free, though there will be a $5 monthly
charge for bill payment, in line with most competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Wells officials say they want to establish their site both as a
banking center and as a resource businesspeople come to for a broad
range of information and services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are positioning ourselves as a small-business financial
destination site,'' Baumli said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the bank will be forced to play catch-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are late and it's very competitive,'' said Sutro's
Chaney. ``It will be expensive for them, but they will spend the
resources needed to make themselves a player.''

(With: NY-GIULIANI, NY-GIULIANI-REACT, NY-GIULIANI-LATEGANO) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the last two months, one sure way to coax Hillary
Rodham Clinton into attacking Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was to ask
about tense relations between Giuliani's police department and the
city's minority communities. But when Katie Couric asked Clinton
that question on a nationally televised town hall meeting Thursday
morning, the first lady let the pitch pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it is useful for us to point fingers at any
one person,'' Clinton said, showing uncharacteristic restraint.
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil surrounding the mayor's personal life has produced,
obviously, a challenge to his presumed campaign for a seat in the
U.S. Senate. But Giuliani's difficulties have also produced an
undeclared shift in strategy by Clinton these last few days, as her
campaign adopts a deliberately low profile while maneuvering to
adjust to an unsettled period filled with opportunities and perils.
</P>
<P>
   The result of that strategy was on display at the town meeting
from NBC studios at Rockefeller Center, where the name Giuliani
barely passed Clinton's lips during an hour of questioning by an
audience of New York voters and the hosts of the ``Today'' show. At
the direction of Clinton's senior advisers, an aide said Thursday,
the first lady and Democratic supporters have moved to shut the
spigot on almost all anti-Giuliani rhetoric, as Clinton adopts a
posture that is intended, unconventionally in this business, to
avoid trying to make news, which would have the effect of shifting
attention away from the mayor and his problems. (Even the normally
voluble state Democratic chairwoman, Judith Hope, did not return
phone calls to discuss the state of the race.)
</P>
<P>
   And next week's state Democratic convention in Albany is being
planned as a low-voltage affair, one aide said. Clinton's
acceptance speech is expected to be undramatic _ devoid of any
sweeping philosophical or policy pronouncement _ and President
Clinton is unlikely to attend, in part to lower the attention
factor, a friend of the Clintons said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for this is that Clinton's aides believed,
even before Giuliani's recent run of difficulties, that the first
lady had hit something of a stride, with a daily mixture of attacks
on Giuliani and policy pronouncements. But the first lady's
advisers are now making a deliberate decision to avoid doing
anything that might take the spotlight away from the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're making all the news,'' one of Clinton's senior
advisers said of the Giuliani campaign. ``What do we need to make
news for? If we make news, you can bet it's the wrong kind of
news.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the first lady's advisers said, Clinton is staying
close to the ground: continuing her travels across the state, but
eschewing the daily attacks on Giuliani's temperament, which have
drawn much coverage, and focusing instead on the kind of dry policy
pronouncements that won't get much attention now. So it was, that
for 60 minutes Thursday Clinton rebuffed attempts by Couric to get
her to discuss Giuliani's problems, and instead plunged into long
discussions about health care, education and other issues that, if
informed, seemed aimed at not breaking any new ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our game plan is simply to stay on plan,'' Sen. Bob Torricelli
of New Jersey, the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee, said in an interview. ``Hillary Clinton is beginning to
assume a commanding position. It's now just a question of
consolidating her lead.'' Torricelli's observations aside, some of
Clinton's advisers view this as a period of risks as well. For one
thing, if Giuliani does not run, they face the task of retooling a
campaign to deal with a new candidate. Clinton's advisers said they
were most concerned at the prospect of running against Gov. George
Pataki, given his fund-raising abilities and popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's advisers said that the governor had no interest in
running for the Senate. But if Giuliani decides not to run, the
governor will face strong pressure to get into this race,
Republicans said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Clinton's aides are wary about their candidate or
any of her surrogates saying anything that might be perceived as
insensitive to Giuliani's situation, particularly in such a charged
media atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of period when you can make mistakes, where
you can say the wrong thing,'' a senior adviser said. ``It's easy
to make a slip of language on Rudy. You can do a lot of harm in
this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been two months since Clinton _ who had been repeatedly
criticized by Democrats for running an unfocused and passionless
campaign _ turned up her attacks on Giuliani, assailing him for his
response to the police shooting of Patrick Dorismond, the same
topic that Clinton avoided discussing with Couric. And in a sense,
Clinton, in moving to the back of the stage, is responding to the
reality of Giuliani's situation; her campaign strategy is now being
driven, at least for the time being, by Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   When or if Clinton reassumes a more aggressive pose is also a
function of what Giuliani does and says. For now, though, Clinton
was described as more than happy to yield to her presumed
Republican opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``She should continue just doing her job: talking about the
issues, visiting the entire state,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y. ``The same exact thing she is doing.''

<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ Shaquille O'Neal was an on- court spectator
for the biggest play of the Los Angeles Lakers' Game 2 victory over
the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday, but he didn't mind.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' leading man and go-to scorer in most situations was
ready to run a pick-and-roll with Kobe Bryant on the final play,
but Bryant had a choice, and he chose to go solo: He ran down the
clock, then hit the game-winner with 2.6 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kobe's probably going to take that shot seven out of 10 times.
And we don't mind him taking that shot,'' O'Neal said. ``I was
joking with him in the locker room. I told him it's about time he
hit one of those shots.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a sequence Bryant has been trained for. Coach Phil Jackson
has put the ball in his hands to create a final shot at the end of
most every quarter, half and game this season. It hasn't always
produced great results, but Bryant's first career game-winner is
certain to boost his confidence _ and confidence in him by his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a redemption,'' Jackson said. ``That was a great
redemption for him and for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't want games to have to come down to that
situation,'' Jackson said. ``Yes, we want him to hit them. I think
he can. He has shown it in the past, he has had struggles in the
past, so it's a 50-50 proposition right now. But we think that we
can eliminate those kind of hail-Mary type opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, of course, a bit Michael Jordanesque.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's Kobe's billing,'' Jackson said. ``That's what
he's going to be as a basketball player, the kind of guy that can
do that. And we want to see him have that success.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant himself had but one regret on the play, which gave the
Lakers the 97-96 win, and a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little upset actually,'' he said, ``because I wanted
to hit it at the buzzer, like Larry Bird used to do.''
</P>
<P>
   __ One more thing: Although Bryant took the last shot, Jackson
said he's perfectly comfortable running a final play for O'Neal in
a similar situation. That, despite O'Neal's 46.6 percent foul
shooting in the playoffs, which Jackson said has been discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows the importance of it to our organization, our team,
everybody is relying on it,'' Jackson said. ``That's for him to
work on. I think he knows how to coach himself in this regard.''
</P>
<P>
   With O'Neal struggling, the Suns actually went to the
intentional foul late in the fourth quarter. O'Neal missed both
free throws and knows that will only invite further fouling.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might do it,'' O'Neal said, ``but it can only get better.
It can't get no worse. . . . Usually, I hit them in situations like
that, but they're good misses. I don't have Olden Polynice-type
misses. I only have good misses, they'll be in and out, and you
know it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ The numbers: Only seven teams have ever come back from an 0-2
deficit to win a seven-game series, and no team has come back from
0-3, a fact the Lakers are conscious of as they head into Game 3 at
America West Arena tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody will come off a 3-0 deficit some day,'' Jackson said,
``but it hasn't happened yet. So I mean, it's pretty obvious that
it means a hell of a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   __ One slip: That the Lakers needed a game-winning shot after
leading by 13 was irksome to all involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we just got bored after getting the 15-point lead and we
took them for granted,'' O'Neal said. ``That's probably what it
was, we probably took this team for granted. And they came down the
stretch, got a couple steals, hit a couple 3s and they're a
dangerous team that way.''

ruling by the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council, a
self-regulatory group. It said Schlessinger, the target of a

REPUBLICANS TO VOTE ON NEW PRIMARY SCHEDULE
</HEADLINE>
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Setting the stage for a major vote Friday on a
new presidential primary system, a Republican committee acted on
Thursday to give its national party new authority to make rules and
punish states if they break them.
</P>
<P>
   The Rules Committee of the Republican National Committee will
vote Friday on a plan to have the least-populous states hold their
primaries first and the most-populous states go last, a proposal by
Bill Brock, a former senator from Tennessee and national party
chairman, that is intended to maintain voter interest throughout
the primaries. Brock said Thursday night that he expected the plan
to be adopted.
</P>
<P>
   That plan, which Brock argued would also give lesser-known
candidates with smaller financial resources a better chance to
compete for the nomination, was hotly debated on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hellon of Arizona argued: ``If you don't get out of ahead
of the process, you're going to get rolled over by it. This is the
time to show some leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   And Diana Adams of Indiana, where the primary came after the
nominations had been decided on March 7, said, ``We ate everybody's
dust.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barbara Alby of California complained, ``The states at the
end of the calendar would never have a chance to influence the
process.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the media would declare someone a winner before then,
even if no one had majority of delegates. Under the plan, 12 large
states with about 47 percent of all delegates would vote last.
</P>
<P>
   Another speaker for a late state, Bill Powers of New York, spoke
for ``states' rights,' saying ``let the states pick the dates.''
</P>
<P>
   If the proposal is adopted by the committee, it must still go to
the full national committee, where chairman Jim Nicholson supports
the Brock plan, and then to the national convention, where big
states wary of the plan have great voting strength.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Thursday's votes marked a significant change in
Republican attitudes, as the complaints of committee members on the
losing side showed.
</P>
<P>
   Alby objected, ``We are not a party that operates as a top down,
command and control model.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton Blackwell of Virginia said it was a conservative
principle that ``Concentration and control of power in the national
party should be avoided wherever possible.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hellon said party rules, even the modest ones already in
force, would be ``irrelevant and academic'' without enforcement
powers.
</P>
<P>
   David Norcross of New Jersey argued for giving party leaders the
flexibility to change the rules between conventions. Without the
hope of negotiating a compromise with Democrats which that
flexibility would allow, he said, ``We are going very, very shortly
to be facing a national primary.''
</P>
<P>
   The new provisions voted would allow the national committee to
strip states of up to 90 percent of their delegates if they held
their primaries or caucuses earlier than the rules allow.
</P>
<P>
   They would also allow the national committee, up until Feb. 1 of
the year before a presidential election, to change the rules about
the timing of primaries. Now only the Republican convention can
change those rules.

DENVER PAPERS TO COMBINE BUSINESS OPERATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After losing $123 million since 1990 in an unsuccessful effort
to win the country's fiercest newspaper war, the owners of The
Denver Rocky Mountain News announced on Thursday that they intended
to combine their business operations with those of The Denver Post,
effectively ceding victory to The Post's owner, William Dean
Singleton.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement ending the war would leave the Denver area with
two newspapers that would compete journalistically but split their
profits equally. To gain its 50 percent share, the E.W. Scripps
Co., the owner of The News, is paying $60 million to Singleton's
MediaNews Group, the owner of The Post.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed joint operating agreement is subject to Justice
Department approval, under the terms of a 30-year-old law that
allows newspapers to skirt antitrust provisions in order to
maintain two editorial voices in a community. If approved, the
Denver arrangement would be the first new joint operating agreement
in 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth W. Lowe, the president and chief operating officer of
Scripps, said at a news conference on Thursday that the losses,
averaging more than $12 million a year, were ``not a situation
Scripps could sustain.'' Scripps is a public company with interests
in newspapers, broadcast television stations and cable television
channels like the Food Network. MediaNews is privately held.
</P>
<P>
   The two newspapers together employ more than 3,600 people, with
1,785 at The News and 1,870 at The Post. In a news release, Scripps
said, ``It is currently anticipated that any need to eliminate
positions will be done primarily through attrition.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement brought gloom to the newsroom of The News, a
tabloid. In recent years, the newspaper has expanded its business
coverage and competed fiercely on breaking news like the murder of
JonBenet Ramsey, last year's killings at Columbine High School and
the sale of a local sports arena. ``People are upset,'' one
reporter said.
</P>
<P>
   Each newspaper won a Pulitzer Prize for Columbine coverage last
year. The Post won in the breaking news category, The News for
breaking news photography.
</P>
<P>
   The aggressive editorial competition was matched, or exceeded,
by an economic competition that led both newspapers to lower their
subscription prices to as little as a penny, cutting circulation
revenues by as much as two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   The price drop, which began almost three years ago, helped pump
up the two newspapers' circulations; the latest daily figures _
446,465 for The News and 413,720 for The Post _ put both in the
ranks of the country's top 25 daily newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   But The News could not translate its circulation gains,
including a 25 percent increase in the most recent report from the
Audit Bureau of Circulations, into profits, Lowe said. The paper
had enjoyed only ``a modest increase in advertising.'' Scripps
also, he said, has ``not been able to turn circulation gains into
operating profits.''
</P>
<P>
   William R. Burleigh, Scripps' chief executive, was to travel to
Washington on Friday to give the Justice Department a statement
declaring The News ``in probable danger of financial failure,''
Lowe said.
</P>
<P>
   Both The News and The Post would continue their daily
publication schedules. On Saturday, the editorial staff of The News
would produce a broadsheet newspaper under both mastheads. The
Post's newsroom would produce the Sunday newspaper, the best-read
newspaper of the week.

HOW ABOUT AN ASSIST FOR APTITUDE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ There's always got to be a wise guy. So
right on cue, and right in character, Bobby Frankel stepped forward
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the horse racing nation is planning a coronation
parade for Kentucky Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus. Frankel is ready
to drop a banana peel in his path.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a great, great horse, possibly,'' the Hall of
Fame trainer said in the morning at his Hollywood Park barn. ``But
he had a pretty good horse chasing him, too.''
</P>
<P>
   That pretty good horse is Aptitude, the Frankel-trained colt who
rallied for third place behind Fusaichi Pegasus in the April 15
Wood Memorial at New York's Aqueduct racetrack and second in last
Saturday's Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel reads about the Derby and wonders if he missed something
that afternoon at Churchill Downs. Was Fusaichi Pegasus the only
horse on the track?
</P>
<P>
   ``What did he beat me by, five f------ lengths?'' the
Brooklyn-born trainer said sarcastically.
</P>
<P>
   No, Fusaichi Pegasus beat Aptitude by 1 moderate lengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was right on his tail,'' Frankel said with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   This is what the 2000 Triple Crown season needed. A dissenting
view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gotta stir it up a little bit,'' Frankel said. ``Hey, I got an
opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the victory by Fusaichi Pegasus and jockey Kent
Desormeaux, the first by a Derby favorite since Spectacular Bid in
1979, the consensus has been that only injury or bad luck can stop
the winner from the first Triple Crown sweep since Affirmed in
1978.
</P>
<P>
   It !ital!was a superb performance. And Frankel doesn't mean to
knock Fusaichi Pegasus. But he rejects some of the conventional
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Did Fusaichi Pegasus have to overcome a bad trip in the Derby as
he rallied from 15th? Frankel maintains that, on the contrary, he
benefited from running most of the race on the firmest part of the
track, next to the rail; only as he turned into the stretch did he
angle seven-wide. Meanwhile, Aptitude and jockey Alex Solis had to
go wide earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kent took the gamble and got through (traffic) all the way.
Alex took the safe way and lost ground,'' Frankel said. ``If
anybody had got in front of Kent, I'd have won. . . . I'm not
saying I should have won it. I'm saying I could have won it.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankel points out that the Sheets, which rate horses'
performances based on final clockings adjusted for factors such as
ground lost on the turns, gave Fusaichi Pegasus and Aptitude
identical 1's for the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Did Fusaichi Pegasus, unwhipped in the final three-sixteenths of
a mile, win with a lot left in the tank? ``How do you run that fast
and win easy?'' Frankel said. The winner ran the sixth-fastest
Derby (1 milesin 2:01).
</P>
<P>
   Is it impossible to see how Fusaichi Pegasus can get beat at the
May 20 Preakness, in Baltimore, and the July 10 Belmont Stakes, in
New York? ``He's coming back in two weeks and he's facing some
fresh faces,'' Frankel said.
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday, seven 3-year-olds, three of whom did not run in
the Derby, were scheduled to challenge Fusaichi Pegasus in the
Preakness: Red Bullet, Wheelaway (fifth in the Derby), Captain
Steve (eighth), High Yield (15th), Hal's Hope (16th), Snuck In
(second in the Arkansas Derby) and Hugh Hefner (the Ed Nahem-owned
California-bred who was second in the Snow Chief Stakes at
Hollywood Park last time out).
</P>
<P>
   This assumes trainer Neil Drysdale will ultimately commit to the
Preakness after making sure Fusaichi Pegasus is 100 percent healthy
following the Derby. Drysdale upgraded the horse's chances of being
at Pimlico from ``possible'' to ``probable'' on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-horse field would match the smallest for the Preakness
since seven ran in 1986, the year Snow Chief and Solis bounced back
to beat Derby winners Ferdinand and Bill Shoemaker.
</P>
<P>
   For all of Frankel's bravado, Aptitude won't run in the
Preakness, waiting for the Belmont, where the trainer hopes the
extra rest and the 1-mile distance will move his colt forward and
prove his point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I run my horse (in the Preakness)?'' said Frankel,
who plans to train Aptitude at Hollywood Park. ``He's a young
horse. I want to have something for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, it's Fusaichi Pegasus and Drysdale who have
something to gain by running in every Triple Crown event.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of the Derby runnerup, the Preakness second
choice is likely to be the Wood Memorial runnerup. That's Red
Bullet, who skipped the Derby so trainer Joe Orseno would have a
``fresh horse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to get my horse into the race at his best,'' Orseno
said. ``If we do that, in my heart I believe we can win the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Frankel and the Derby, Orseno looks at the Wood and sees
how it might have turned out differently. Solis, riding Red Bullet
then, put the colt closer to the pace than the trainer would have
preferred.
</P>
<P>
   Orseno maintains that if he'd lagged early, Red Bullet would
have been able to stay with Fusaichi Pegasus late. He's encouraged
by Aptitude's sharp performance in the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``His being able to lose the ground he did, and only get beat
the margin he did, makes me feel good about my chances,'' Orseno
said on the phone from New York. ``I think my horse is better than
Aptitude.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's a debate for another day. &QL;

MERRILL LYNCH JOINS PUSH TO IMPROVE EMPLOYEE PERKS
</HEADLINE>
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. has joined the rush of Wall
Street firms offering perks and risk-free investment opportunities
to attract young investment bankers and prevent others from
defecting to Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill, one of the nation's biggest securities firms, is
building a fitness center for employees near its headquarters in
lower Manhattan and providing a concierge service to handle chores
like shopping and laundry. The firm also hopes to lock in
investment bankers by giving them chances to invest _ with a
financial sweetener from the firm _ in new-economy companies that
are still private.
</P>
<P>
   The moves, some of which Merrill announced internally on
Thursday, are the latest in a series of efforts by Wall Street
firms to stem defections. The firms are still developing these
benefits despite the recent weakness in technology stocks and
rising doubts about many Internet businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fever pitch has died down,'' said Mary Taylor, a
senior vice president at Merrill. ``People are a little more
even-keeled about it and not just saying, `I have to go to a
dot-com.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wall Street executives say the competition for people
with strong analytical skills remains fierce. To compete, some
firms are simply raising salaries. But most are trying to devise
incentives that will have a minimal impact on their firms'
quarterly income if the stock market remains shaky.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill's mid-level to senior investment bankers will be able to
invest as much as $1 million of their own money in a new
private-equity fund with a focus on companies in technology, media
and telecommunications. For each dollar an employee invests, the
firm will put in $2 and let the employee keep the return on the
full amount.
</P>
<P>
   Younger bankers who are not qualified to _ or cannot afford to _
invest their own money will receive options worth as much as
$100,000 on shares in the fund next month. Those options will give
bankers in their first few years out of college or business school
the chance to reap big gains without putting up any money. The
catch is that they have to stay around to collect the gains when
they are distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor described those benefits are ``more cost-effective and
efficient'' than increasing salaries or cash bonuses. She declined
to say how Merrill would account for them but hinted that they were
designed to have a limited impact on the firm's reported
compensation expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs Group, which recently handed out shares of its own
stock to 8,000 junior employees, and Credit Suisse First Boston are
drawing up similar plans.
</P>
<P>
   Some investment banks, including Lehman Brothers Holdings and
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, have offered senior bankers similar
leveraged investment opportunities for years. Now, they and other
firms are spreading the potential wealth more broadly to retain the
young bankers who are most likely to be enticed by the prospect of
quicker riches.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette shook up the industry a few weeks
ago when it offered hefty guaranteed pay for two years to young
bankers who would sign agreements not to go to work for
competitors. But other big firms have declined to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Locking in base salaries and bonuses for two years, given the
uncertainties of the market, is not the prudent thing to do,'' said
Alicia Whitaker, a managing director at Credit Suisse First Boston.
``We continue to believe that a high percentage of variable
compensation is what's appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker said her firm's recent increase of base salaries to
$55,000 from $40,000 for first-year bankers, and to $65,000 from
$45,000 for second-year bankers, shows that the firm is committed
to paying some of the highest base salaries in the industry. Those
raises, in turn, will drive up salaries through the rest of the
investment bank, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The firm is also planning to offer private-equity investments to
bankers all the way down to the lowest levels, Whitaker said,
because the tug of war among investment banks and dot-com companies
rages on. ``We'd love to think that it's over,'' she said, ``but
our people are still getting calls.''

SUPPORT FOR GUN CONTROL HAS DECLINED, SURVEY SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBIN TONER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Against the political backdrop of Sunday's Million
Mom March for gun control, a new poll shows that overall support
for restrictions on guns has declined in the last two months,
mostly because men have grown increasingly sympathetic toward the
rights of gun owners.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, conducted by the Pew Research Center for The People
and The Press, found that the gender gap on the gun issue is
getting bigger. When asked what is more important, 49 percent of
the men said the rights of gun owners, while 46 percent said gun
control. In contrast, 28 percent of the women said the rights of
gun owners were more important, while 67 percent said gun control
was.
</P>
<P>
   Men over 50 were particularly supportive of gun owners' rights;
55 percent said those rights were more important than gun control,
a sharp increase from the 37 percent who said that two months ago.
The poll found that women were strong supporters of gun control
regardless of age.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, 57 percent of the public put the priority on gun
restrictions in the new poll, 38 percent on the rights of gun
owners. A Pew survey in March found that 66 percent support gun
restrictions, 29 percent gun owners' rights.
</P>
<P>
   After the shooting last year at Columbine High School, which
left 15 dead, many pollsters found support for gun control soared.
But Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Poll, said the latest survey
hints at a pro-gun backlash among men, and suggests the
effectiveness of campaigns by groups like the National Rifle
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Second Amendment proponents are campaigning,
they're clearly making a case with their constituents _ white men _
and it's having some effect,'' Kohut said.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also found that Americans are skeptical about the
chances of Congress passing major gun legislation this year; only
14 percent said it was very likely, 34 percent said it was somewhat
likely. And 10 percent had heard a lot about the Million Mom March,
while 42 percent had heard a little.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted May 2 to 6 and was based on a sample of
1,303 adults, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus
three percentage points.

LOS ALAMOS WILD FIRE FORCES EVACUATION OF 25,000 PEOPLE FROM THEIR
HOMES

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. _ Fed by winds gusting at up to 50 miles an
hour, a wild fire here resumed its path of devastation on Thursday,
forcing the evacuation of as many as 25,000 people and destroying
at least 150 homes, perhaps twice that number, but apparently not
causing serious damage at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, where
nuclear weapons are designed.
</P>
<P>
   As officials warned that there was still little chance of
bringing the blaze under control until the weather changed, a
growing chorus of local and national officials began to express
their anger at the National Park Service, which set what it had
hoped would be a controlled fire a week ago before high winds sent
it racing across heavily wooded canyons toward the populated areas.
</P>
<P>
   As reports circulated here that the National Weather Service had
warned before the fire was set that high winds were expected, the
Interior Department, which operates the park service, announced
late in the day that Roy Weaver, the superintendent of the
Bandelier National Monument, where the fire was set, was placed on
administrative leave pending an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe someone is responsible,'' Sen. Pete Domenici,
R-N.M., said at a press conference here on Thursday morning. ``The
person in charge at the park service who authorized the burn is
most responsible.'' He added that he intended to ask for a federal
investigation of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Although more than 18,000 acres have already burned and more
than 1,000 emergency and fire personnel have been brought in to try
and control the fire, there have been no injuries reported and the
hasty evacuation of the huge number of people was described as
orderly.
</P>
<P>
   But Los Alamos presented a disconcerting tableau on Thursday,
during a reporter's visit to the blackened streets. Fire vehicles
rushed about, the skies dark with thick plumes of white smoke and
helicopters occasionally whirring overhead, carrying huge buckets
of water. Most neighborhoods presented an eerie checkerboard of
destruction, with houses seemingly selected at random for total
destruction alongside other homes left unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who flew in from a conference
in San Diego Thursday morning, said the Los Alamos National
Laboratory had suffered some fire damage but was secure. Energy
Department officials said the fire had passed over some concrete
and earth bunkers where conventional explosives are stored, causing
no damage. The officials said that at one point the fire had come
within 300 yards of a building where plutonium is stored but that
the building is heavily fortified and is safe. Though some nuclear
material is stored at the laboratory, there are no nuclear weapons
there.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said there were no signs that any radiation had been
released.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 11,000 people who work at the laboratory, only security
guards and one dozen or two dozen workers in the emergency
operations center remain, said Kay Roybal, a spokeswoman for the
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Roybal would not speculate on how experiments might be affected
by the closing of the laboratory but said that scientists each year
must plan around a shutdown from Christmas through Jan. 1. ``I
think there are ways to handle most of that,'' she said. ``Whether
people had time to do that this time, I can't say.''
</P>
<P>
   Each day of the shutdown costs from $3.5 million to $5 million
in salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, just the 11,000 or so residents of Los Alamos, a tidy
town high on a mesa at about 7,200 feet, had been evacuated. But
starting on Wednesday night and then throughout the day on Thursday
the residents of the nearby towns of White Rock and the Espanola
Valley, as well as Abiqui, were told to leave the area. Abiqui is
famous for having been the home of Georgia O'Keefe, the artist, for
many years and much of her work is still kept there.
</P>
<P>
   A local radio station took calls from people all day who
recounted having been given just minutes to clear out of their
homes. Many said they had had time to do little more than throw
some clothes into plastic garbage bags, grab their pets and
children and flee, with the smoke and flames visible nearby. One
man called in to ask if any of the authorities had information
about his two dogs; he had not had time to bring them in before he
departed in haste on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The streets of Los Alamos were a crazy quilt of random
destruction. The heat of the fires transformed many houses, cars,
utility poles and lawns into cinders. Typical was 49th Street in
the western part of the city, where the once tidy homes were razed
in twos and threes, while right alongside them other homes were
untouched, the grass still green.
</P>
<P>
   Viola Stowe, a resident of the city, who had been evacuated to a
shelter at a high school in Espanola, said she watched a house burn
on the television news on Wednesday night, and only when the camera
pulled back did she realize it was her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't plan for these things,'' she said. ``You don't think
it'll happen to you.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials said it appeared that at least 150 houses had
been destroyed and that the number might go as high as 300.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has already declared the region a disaster
area, making it eligible for federal aid, and emergency officials
flew in on Thursday from Washington to both help control the fire
and to plan relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday in Washington, when asked about the government's
liability for the fire, the president said, ``We have to look in to
see what the real facts are and what the responsibility of the
government is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we should be focusing on doing everything we can to
minimize the damage of the fire and protect the lab assets, deal
with the human problems,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was burning to the north and to the northeast on
Thursday, away from populated areas. But firefighters were still
concerned, in part because the flames were spewing burning chunks
of wood thousands of feet in the air, where they were being blown
as far as a mile and starting new fires. Also, any shift in the
winds could push the fires toward homes and the nuclear lab, where
some buildings have already been singed.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Purtymun, a Los Alamos police officer, said another
concern was that because the fires had left many houses and trees
standing, there was still plenty of fuel if the blaze roared across
the city again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, anything can happen now,'' said Mike Gowey, a Forest
Service firefighter. ``There are spot fires everywhere. This is
nowhere near under control.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service defended the practice of setting
controlled fires, saying the fires are an essential means of
heading off devastating accidental fires in forests that have grown
overly dense because of fire suppression over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of a prescribed burn is to eliminate underbrush to
head off catastrophic fires,'' said Michael Gauldin, the chief
spokesman for the Interior Department. He said such burns were
conducted over millions of acres every year, by the Forest Service,
the Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was intentionally set last Thursday as part of a
continuing effort by Bandelier National Monument to thin out some
of the dense growth that makes the pine forests in the region among
the most combustible in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Park Service officials say they weighed the factors that go into
such planning: the amount of wood and other tinder in the forest,
the moisture content of the fuels, the relative humidity and
temperature of the air, and the speed of the wind. Then they
plugged the data into a computer program and decided conditions
were auspicious for a safe and effective burn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The data and the spot weather forecasts met the fire
prescription,'' the Bandelier superintendent, Weaver, said in an
interview before his suspension was announced. ``It's not like
someone was just picking things out of the air.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Weaver said the fire team had requested and received weather
updates throughout the day, as late as two hours before the flames
were ignited at 7:20 p.m. Thursday. Seeing no reason to call off
the plan, the crew set the fire. Then, he said, the winds whipped
up unexpectedly, and the flames began spreading toward Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   About seven hours before the fire was set, the National Weather
Service office in Albuquerque faxed a report, requested by
Bandelier, predicting that winds on the ridgetops would increase to
10 to 15 miles an hour that evening, gusting to 20 miles an hour
the next day. The report also said relative humidity would not
increase as much as it normally does in the evening, ranging
between 15 percent to as high as 30 percent after midnight. A more
normal nighttime reading is 50 to 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The weather report also predicted that a factor called the
Haines index, which measures the tendency of smoke and flames to
rise vertically, was at its maximum level _ 6 on a scale of 2 to 6.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wallace Covington, a professor at Northern Arizona
University's School of Forestry in Flagstaff, said that these
numbers, while not ideal, would not automatically rule out a burn.
If the ground is too wet and the air too still, he said, a burn
will not do its job. And while a high Haines index might mean
flames are more likely to leap into the tree tops, starting a
rapidly proliferating ``crown fire,'' the vertical motion also
helps keep smoke away from settlements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the devil and the deep blue sea,'' Covington said.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver said that his staff attempted a prescribed burn in the
same area in fall 1992, when the air was more humid and still. ``It
accomplished nothing,'' he said. ``We wasted our time and
resources. ``

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In pointed questions to lawyers for both sides in the
battle over the future of Elian Gonzalez, three federal judges
wondered Thursday how a 6-year-old who cannot even sign his full
name could apply for political asylum but questioned whether
sending him back to communist Cuba was in his best interests,
regardless of his father's fitness as a parent.
</P>
<P>
   Judge J.L. Edmondson, a conservative judge appointed to the 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals by President Ronald Reagan, noted
that it was not uncommon for courts to rule that a child's best
interests override the rights of a parent, as in the case of
parents who refuse their child a doctor's care because of their
religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Edmondson, who twice referred to Cuba as a ``communist,
totalitarian state,'' said it was not that such parents did not
believe they were acting in their child's behalf, but that their
actions seemed ``so conspicuously in conflict with the needs of the
child.''
</P>
<P>
   During lulls in the arguments, some 100 protesters just outside
the courtroom could be faintly heard chanting, ``Free Elian!''
Later, as lawyers for the government and for Elian's father left
the courtroom, the protesters shouted, ``Communist!'' over and
over. The outbursts, which have been commonplace in Miami for
months now, puzzled many in Atlanta as they walked past the
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Edmondson, the senior member of the three-judge panel that heard
the appeal of a decision by a federal district judge in Miami that,
in effect, denied a request by Elian's relatives in that city for a
political asylum hearing, said before Thursday's hearing that a
decision would probably come in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Immigration and Naturalization Service have
repeatedly argued that Elian is simply not old enough to understand
the application for political asylum that he signed in a childlike
scrawl after it appeared that federal officials were planning to
send him back to Cuba to be with his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
And, the lawyers for the government argued again Thursday, only the
father can speak for his son.
</P>
<P>
   This hearing may be the last chance the Miami relatives have of
keeping Elian in the United States in defiance of his father's
wishes, legal experts said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. immigration officials and the federal district court in
Miami have already rejected the request for any asylum hearing
filed on Elian's behalf by his great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez, who
took care of the boy after he was found clinging to an inner tube
in the Atlantic. Elian was rescued on Thanksgiving Day after his
mother drowned in an effort to cross from Cuba to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Elian Gonzalez is a very bright and intelligent
6-year-old, but he didn't even have the ability to sign his last
name on the asylum petition,'' said Judge Charles R. Wilson, an
appointee of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, whose third member is Judge Joel Dubina, who was
appointed by President George Bush and is considered a moderate,
has several options, legal experts and lawyers for both sides say.
It could rule that immigration officials were correct in denying
the boy an asylum hearing based on his age, even though immigration
laws guarantee an asylum hearing for ``any alien.''
</P>
<P>
   Or it could order immigration officials to give Elian a hearing,
even though the boy is now in the legal custody of his father in a
secluded federal retreat in Maryland. The reunion followed an armed
federal raid on the relatives' home in Miami in the pre-dawn hours
of April 22.
</P>
<P>
   Or the court could ask immigration officials to speak with the
boy about his wishes, but not in a formal hearing.
</P>
<P>
   If the court rules against the Miami relatives, it could also
lift an injunction that bars Elian from leaving the country,
allowing father and son to return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   There is no guarantee that the full court _ there are 12 active
judges on the 11th Circuit bench _ or the U.S. Supreme Court will
hear the case if the three-judge panel rules against the Miami
family.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual address to the crowded courtroom just minutes
before the hearing, Edmondson, not yet dressed in his robe,
cautioned lawyers and onlookers that they should not try to draw
conclusions from the panel's questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is entirely possible that a judge may make a statement or
ask a question that is the exact opposite of what he is thinking,
because he may want to see how the lawyers respond to it,''
Edmondson said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the hearing, which lasted less than an hour and a half,
it seemed at least that lawyers for Lazaro Gonzalez had found a
sympathetic ear in Edmondson.
</P>
<P>
   He compared the case, in theory, to that of a child who had been
rescued from a communist country in the former Soviet Union by a
mother who gave her life to deliver him to freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall Coffey, a lawyer for the Miami family, said Elian would
be paraded around Cuba, more a trophy than a boy growing up in his
old life there. His father would have little to say about his son's
life, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no parent in Cuba who controls what happens to his or
her child, and there is no power in this country,'' Coffey said of
the United States, ``that can protect this child if he is removed
to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gregory Craig, a lawyer for Juan Miguel Gonzalez, said the
boy's father was not being manipulated by the government of
President Fidel Castro and was free to ``openly express his
feelings and his opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked by the panel why it had taken his client five months to
come to the United States to seek the return of his son, Craig said
Gonzalez tried to work through his own government to get Elian
returned to him.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Wilson seemed skeptical of how Elian could have understood a
complicated form requesting an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   He also questioned whether, considering the fact that Elian is
now in the custody of his father, immigration officials could even
accept an application filed by someone who no longer has custody of
the child.
</P>
<P>
   The question of Elian's request for asylum may be moot if the
judges accept the premise that he never filed for asylum, that he
only scratched his name on the form because he was told to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really wasn't Elian who filed an asylum application; it was
Lazaro Gonzalez who filed the application for him,'' said Bernard
Perlmutter, director of the University of Miami Children and Youth
Law Clinic. ``People other than the father were making claims on
behalf of the child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think the court has to be swayed by the paramount
interest of the child,'' Perlmutter said. ``Are the facts in this
case sufficient to warrant an intrusion in the father's rights to
speak for his son? I don't think there is sufficient evidence that
anyone other than Juan Miguel Gonzalez can speak for Elian in this
case.''
</P>
<P>
   To ultimately win, even if the case does wind up in an asylum
hearing, lawyers for the boy's Miami relatives must prove that
Elian was being persecuted for political reasons and that he was
afraid of that persecution, legal experts said.
</P>
<P>
   That, for a 6-year-old boy, would seem unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no objective basis for an independent asylum claim,''
a spokesman for the Justice Department said.

FLORIO PUTS CORZINE ON THE DEFENSIVE IN THEIR FIRST DEBATE
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ After enduring an eight-week barrage of costly
television commercials by Jon Corzine, his opponent in the
Democratic primary, former Gov. Jim Florio, seized control of their
first debate Thursday, forcing Corzine on the defensive for a full
hour as the two men showed why theirs is perhaps the most
captivating Senate race outside New York.
</P>
<P>
   Florio, who had to wait nearly a year for the chance to debate
his rival, made the most of the opportunity, ridiculing Corzine's
proposals, likening his views to those of Republican politicians
and repeatedly attacking his main qualification for the Senate: his
record as the former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   But Corzine, an unpolished speaker who had seemed reluctant to
attack Florio personally, criticized the former governor for
raising taxes by $2.8 billion during the 1990 recession, a decision
that cost Florio his job and led to a Republican takeover of the
state Legislature. ``I think we took a problem and made it a
crisis,'' Corzine said.
</P>
<P>
   In his prepared opening statement, Corzine sought to cast Florio
as a bad memory best forgotten. ``People can embrace the past
without embracing its failures,'' he said. ``The voters of New
Jersey are looking to the future, and the Democratic Party should
as well.''
</P>
<P>
   But when their exchanges were extemporaneous, Florio was far
more effective. When Corzine tried to talk about the specifics of
what he calls his ``bold ideas,'' for example, Florio delivered a
withering retort: ``Words,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bold is about taking on the gun lobby,'' Florio said. ``Bold
is raising the money to finance education for our children. Bold is
going out and making sure that we have a clean environment by
taking on corporate polluters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rhetoric is rhetoric, words are words,'' he added. ``This is
not bold; this is baloney.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate Thursday was the first chance for most New Jerseyans
to see the two Democratic candidates side by side, and it gave
Florio, who has not yet been able to afford his own television ads,
a chance to address a broad audience of voters.
</P>
<P>
   The debate was taped in Trenton for broadcast Thursday night on
the New Jersey Network, a state-owned group of public television
and radio stations that sponsored the event with The New York
Times. It will be shown again on Sunday at 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Florio held a wide lead in the polls against Corzine, a newcomer
to politics, until Corzine started his ad campaign in mid-March and
began steadily eroding that gap. Officials in both campaigns say
the former governor holds an edge of about only 6 percentage points
among likely Democratic voters, and they expect the race to be
close right up until the primary on June 6.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Thursday's encounter, Corzine tried several times to
outline his ideas for universal health care, long-term care for the
elderly or disabled, and education, and Florio belittled them as
unrealistic and too expensive. But the two men focused far more on
their backgrounds in business and politics than on their proposals.
</P>
<P>
   When Corzine spoke in favor of gun control measures, for
example, Florio zeroed in on Goldman Sachs' links to gun
manufacturers, saying the firm had advised the makers of Smith &AMP;
Wesson, Remington and Ruger firearms in various transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine first denied he had led Goldman Sachs while it was
advising those companies, then said that the stocks of companies
that make guns occasionally ``flow through our portfolios provided
for the investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Florio responded: ``Jon is getting very good at the political
art of squirming off the hook. We're not talking about trading
stocks, we're talking about raising capital to go into gun
manufacturing companies. And through this whole last decade, Jon
was either the CEO or he was a member of the nine-member management
commission.''
</P>
<P>
   Florio's attacks were so persistent that Corzine at one point
felt compelled to defend his former employer. ``I'm proud of my
record at Goldman Sachs; I'm proud of Goldman Sachs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine offered his most extended rebuke of Florio for raising
taxes in 1990, after promising as a candidate the year before that
he would not. Had he been in Florio's shoes, Corzine said, he would
never have made such a promise. And he would not have raised the
sales tax, the ``most regressive'' kind of tax, in any case, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor, you told the New Jersey public that you would look
at the $12.6 billion state budget and find savings,'' Corzine said,
adding that Florio's actions evinced ``a ready, fire, aim
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Florio called Corzine's recollection ``an Orwellian
rewriting of history,'' and questioned how Corzine would have
replaced the sales tax revenue. ``Jon just took $700 million out of
the equation,'' he said. ``That's fine, but I'm still waiting for
him to say what he would have done.''

KART GROUPS NEGOTIATING FOR WEEKLY RACING SCHEDULE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH LAIR  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRWINDALE, Calif. _ Two karting organizations are negotiating to
hold racing events at Irwindale Speedway in August. Superkarts USA
and Southern California Sprinters would like to race on the track's
asphalt infield, speedway general manager Bob DeFazio said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They liked how good the surface is,'' DeFazio said.
</P>
<P>
   The track, which is negotiating with various parties to build
and operate a world-class facility in the parking lot, held a
practice last week in the speedway infield and along turns 1 and 2
of the half-mile oval. Twenty-eight karts raced the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we had a fabulous response,'' DeFazio said. ``It was
all word of mouth. We're trying to see if this is do-able on a
weekly basis. We're just trying to see if people like it.''
</P>
<P>
   DeFazio says the speedway will probably hold another practice
session next Thursday with the same format. The track would open at
some point after 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 100 kart racers live in the San Gabriel Valley,
according to driver Ken Madison of Monrovia, and a permanent
facility would be ideal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adams (in Riverside) is as rough as a cob and it's a long ways
to Willow Springs (in Rosamond),'' he said. ``Guys need a facility
that is close to here, so hopefully, they can do something.''
</P>
<P>
   DeFazio says he has been working with Italian karters on the
design of a track.
</P>
<P>
   One driver who would like to see this happen is Al Arciero. One
of the partners in the speedway, Arciero took part in last week's
practice session. But he says that even though he favors the
building of a track, he has no say in the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all what (CEO) Jim Williams wants,'' he said. ``He knows
how important it is to nurture young drivers and he knows how
important it is from a business aspect. If he puts a kart track in,
great. But he has to have the business aspect to back up a go-kart
track.''
</P>
<P>
   __ SRL returns: Davey Hamilton's Supermodified Racing League
will return to the speedway, along with the American Racing Truck
National Championship Finals.
</P>
<P>
   The SRL, which raced on April 1, will return on Oct. 21. Troy
Regier set a track record of 118.781 mph, 15.154 seconds during
qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   The ART National Championships _ also held at the speedway last
year _ will again be a two-day affair with qualifying and heat
races on Friday, Nov. 3, and the finals on Nov. 4. The series will
also race at the speedway on June 17, Aug. 26 and Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   __ Featured races: NASCAR Late Models will be the featured
series in Saturday's card, which gets underway at 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR Super Stocks, the MSRA Pro-4 Modifieds, USAC
three-quarter midgets and figure-8s will also be racing.
</P>
<P>
   Radio personality Rick Minyard will make his Irwindale debut in
the MSRA class. Minyard is the co-host of a nationally syndicated
talk radio show, broadcast on KRLA-1110 AM in the L.A. area.
</P>
<P>
   In honor of Mother's Day, all moms will be allowed to take a lap
around the track after Saturday's racing.

CUTTING-EDGE GAMES, SYSTEMS TAKE STAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Sony's PlayStation 2 might be the homecoming
queen at this year's Electronic Entertainment Expo, but Sound
Source Interactive is a scene-stealing debutante.
</P>
<P>
   The Calabasas, Calif.,-based publisher of video games for young
children is changing its focus and hoping to drum up some business
among retail buyers at the trade show that runs through Saturday at
the Los Angeles Convention Center and is expected to draw 55,000
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a coming-out party for us,'' said Vincent
Bitetti, Sound Source's chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sound Source has entered the (game) console business. We're
really trying to make a statement that Sound Source is growing.
We're here and we're here to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has been plagued by slow sales as it exits the
CD-ROM category, a market segment crowded by big-name game
publishers. Its stock, which has traded as high as 81.25 cents in
the past 12 months, closed at 34 cents Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At E3, as the interactive software industry's largest
international trade show is known, Sound Source is showing off some
of the titles it plans to release for game consoles, its new market
niche. They include ``The Land Before Time: Return to The Great
Valley,'' an adventure game for the Sony PlayStation based on Sound
Source's popular license from Lucas Entertainment. The game is
expected to hit stores in September.
</P>
<P>
   Another new game from Sound Source is ``Casper: Friends Around
the World,'' also for Sony PlayStation. Scheduled for release in
October, the game targets an older audience than Sound Source
usually goes after, Bitetti said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Calabasas neighbor, THQ Inc., also is using the
show to cover new ground. THQ on Thursday rolled out its 2000
product lineup, which includes ``Summoner,'' a title it is
developing for PlayStation 2.
</P>
<P>
   THQ spokeswoman Liz Pieri said the company has several other
titles in development for the new console, but only Summoner has a
release date right now. THQ plans to develop titles under its
license with the World Wrestling Federation for PlayStation 2, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The company also is expanding into the online gaming arena,
albeit slowly, with ``WWF With Authority,'' an online trading card
game designed by THQ's in-house design division, Genetic Anomalies,
for dial-up Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   Pieri said THQ has big plans for online gaming, but that the
technology isn't quite to the point where it can support the
transmission speeds necessary to do justice to its games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be there. People are definitely exploring and
researching,'' she said. ``Our first step is (through) Genetic
Anomalies.''
</P>
<P>
   While others venture into new territory, Disney Interactive is
sticking with the familiar and the successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire'' has driven Disney's ABC to the
top of the television ratings, so why shouldn't the show be the
driving force behind Disney's interactive software division as
well?
</P>
<P>
   A follow-up to the first version of the game for PCs is now in
stores, and it is the highlight of Disney Interactive's booth at
the trade show.

CITY CAN DEAL WITH LAPD, MAYOR SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BETH BARRETT AND GREG GITTRICH 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Back in Los Angeles after days of meetings in
Washington, D.C., Mayor Richard Riordan on Thursday stood by his
insistence that local leaders - not the federal government - should
carry out reforms of the Los Angeles Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``In these discussions and meetings on police issues, I wanted
to make clear to them that we know what the problems are. We know
what must be done to correct those problems,'' Riordan said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The two-page statement did not diverge from earlier comments the
mayor made during a telephone interview with the Los Angeles Daily
News on Tuesday, one day after U.S. Justice Department officials
threatened to sue the city unless significant police reforms are
implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan, who flew to Washington last week after getting early
word of the federal ultimatum, has consistently supported LAPD
Chief Bernard C. Parks. But the mayor has not indicated whether he
is willing to fight the threatened civil rights lawsuit if federal
officials insist upon taking control of the LAPD under a federal
court consent decree.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations over the terms of a proposed consent decree,
required by the federal government to avoid the lawsuit, are
scheduled to begin next week.
</P>
<P>
   In his Thursday statement, Riordan said reforms in the LAPD are
``well under way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an inspector general and his independent review panel
that is investigating the department and returning with its own
findings. We have a police chief who has made it a priority to
implement sound management, supervision, training and officer
discipline. And we have expedited the implementation of a computer
system to track bad cops,'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political leadership of Los Angeles, the City Council, and
the mayor have embraced the spirit of reform and has the resolve to
bring about those changes.''
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the City Council has conceded the city needs
federal help to clean up problems in the LAPD but stopped short of
saying the city should hand over control of the department to a
federal monitor. Parks has declined to comment publicly since
Justice Department officials met with him and other city leaders on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan said he met with Bill Lann Lee, acting chief of the
Justice Department's civil rights division, upon returning to Los
Angeles on Wednesday afternoon. According to the mayor, Lee ``wants
to work with the city as a partner in reaching a realistic
resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he recognizes the willingness of our city's leadership
to implement reform. He also said the Justice Department wants to
avoid a costly and damaging lawsuit as much as we do.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor argued the purpose of next week's negotiations and
future meetings is not to appease the Justice Department in order
to avoid a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our purpose is positive,'' he said. ``Together we want to
identify the most effective remedy to ensure the Justice Department
concerns are addressed and that best serves the interests of Los
Angeles and its Police Department.''
</P>
<P>
   The strength and specifics of the Justice Department's case
against the LAPD remain unknown and likely would not be revealed to
the public in detail unless the city fights the lawsuit in court.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities have said a four-year probe of the LAPD
found lax supervision in the department has led officers to engage
``in a pattern or practice of excessive force, false arrests, and
unreasonable searches and seizures.''
</P>
<P>
   Empowered by a 1994 federal law, the Justice Department has
hashed out consent decrees with state and city police departments
in Pennsylvania, Ohio and New Jersey. In each case, a federal
monitor was put in place to oversee the reforms, federal officials
said.

STANLEY BOXER, 73, PROLIFIC ARTIST KNOWN FOR ABSTRACT PAINTINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stanley Boxer, a versatile artist known for his thickly brushed
abstract paintings, died on Monday at the Berkshire Medical Center
in Pittsfield, Mass. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from colon cancer, according to his
wife, Joyce Weinstein, a painter.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York City, Boxer was a natural draftsman but began
formal art training only after leaving the Navy at the end of World
War II, when his brother persuaded him to take classes at the Art
Students League. He was immediately drawn to painting and stayed
with it for nearly five decades.
</P>
<P>
   A prolific and tireless worker, he was in the studio seven days
a week, preferred the term ``practitioner'' to ``artist'' and
routinely rotated his attention among several media, including
painting, drawing, sculpture and printmaking. Within painting, he
explored a variety of styles.
</P>
<P>
   At one point he caught the eye of the critic Clement Greenberg,
and he was sometimes lumped in with the ``color field'' painters
whom Greenberg championed, notably Jules Olitski. But Boxer himself
was adamant in rejecting this stylistic label. Over the years, he
remained loyal to the materially dense abstract mode on which his
reputation rested.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer had his first solo exhibition of paintings in New York in
1953. He showed regularly with Tibor de Nagy through 1975, and in
that year began an association with Andre Emmerich Gallery that
lasted until 1993. At the time of his death he was represented by
Salander-O'Reilly Galleries, where a selection of his sculpture was
on view last summer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University in Waltham,
Mass., organized a career retrospective of Boxer's work in all
media. Traveling retrospectives of his drawings, which are largely
figurative, were organized in 1978 and 1991. A one-person show of
his paintings appeared at the Butler Institute of Art in
Youngstown, Ohio, last year. His work is in the permanent
collection of many museums, including the Museum of Modern Art and
the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, the Boston Museum
of Fine Art and the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, of Ancramdale, N.Y., he is survived by
a brother, Louis, of Key Largo, Fla.

TAKE A KITTY TO LUNCH, INDOORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIK NELSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This Saturday, it's OK to let your cat out of the
bag or even allow a cat to get your tongue. Just don't let Tiger
out of the house if you want to observe ``National Keep Your Cat
Indoors Day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cats are a threat to wild birds,'' said Gavin Shire of the
American Bird Conservancy, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group
that created this day of kitty incarceration last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kill birds by the millions. We don't even know how many
cats there are out there, let alone how many birds they kill.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitty keepers say: So what?
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't necessarily that they like to eat birds; it's that
cats require a high-protein diet. They are built to eat this kind
of thing, just like cows eat grass,'' said Susie Page, corporate
secretary of the Panorama City, Calif.-based American Cat
Association, a cat registry.
</P>
<P>
   And loose cats have also benefited mankind since they were
domesticated in ancient Egypt, Page pointed out. ``Since man and
animals began, cats have been used to control the rodent
population.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Page, a former cat magazine columnist and author of the
1998 book, ``The Complete Cat Owner's Manual,'' said she keeps her
own cats indoors to protect them from such hazards as cars,
pesticides and disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a pet, you cannot control the pestilence, the
fleas, the worms, the ringworm, that they pick up outdoors,'' Page
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cat keeper Amanda Collins is one of 32.1 million families that
have 64.2 million cats, and she believes they deserve to be
free-range felines. At least that is what she practices with hers,
an orange tabby called Shere Kahn, a black cat named Bagheera and a
white cat named Blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had them inside for a long time, and they're just not
happy,'' said Collins as her 10-year-old son, Justin, played with
Shere Kahn on the family's front lawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're responsible with them, if they're healthy, not out
making babies and not out spreading disease, there should be no
reason why they shouldn't be out,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Justin, however, said he knows a secret about Shere Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one eats doves,'' he said, pointing at the tabby.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Richard Felosky, district manager for Los Angeles' West
Valley Animal Shelter, knows about mixing cats and birds in the
same neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've personally seen the results - we get complaints all the
time'' about bird baths becoming bloodbaths and bird feeders
becoming cat feeders, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The other side of the equation is that some people retaliate for
this behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shoot (cats) with pellet guns, they trap them, they'll
spray them, stone them and poison them,'' Felosky said, adding that
killing cats is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   In the political arena, bird advocates can be just as ruthless,
insisted Nathan Winograd, director of community programs for the
San Francisco Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
</P>
<P>
   ```Keep Your Cat Indoors Day' is nothing more than a vehicle for
them to push their anti-cat rhetoric,'' Winograd said. He cited a
1994 study by the Worldwatch Institute that blamed the decline of
bird species not on cats but rather on urban sprawl, overtrapping,
drought and pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the cat vs. bird argument can be moot in some
neighborhoods, such as the Santa Monica Mountains foothills, where
nature does a pretty good job of protecting birds from cats.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Heaton keeps her Dweezil and her son's Vanna inside -
safe from ``coyote country,'' where cat skulls and bones turn up on
the hillsides.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will not see an outdoor cat around here,'' she said. ``If
you do, soon you will see it on a `missing' sign.''
