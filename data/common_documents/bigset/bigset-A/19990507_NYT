HEARTY WELCOME FOR SHIP'S CREW DEPLOYED SIX MONTHS

   BREMERTON, Wash. _ Streaked with corrosion and rust but with
sailors in immaculate white uniforms manning the rail, the aircraft
carrier USS Carl Vinson received a hero's welcome Thursday as it
returned home from a six-month deployment to the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier's 47,000-mile journey ended where it began exactly
six months ago as Navy tugs pushed the 95,000-ton warship into its
mooring spot at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton shortly
after 8:30 a.m. More than 5,000 family members and friends jammed
the narrow streets of the naval shipyard, transforming the
industrial facility into a sea of colored balloons and hand-painted
posters.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier reciprocated, serenading the crowd with classical
and pop music broadcast over its flight deck and releasing 5,000
colored balloons as it approached.
</P>
<P>
   The Carl Vinson served nearly half its time in the Persian Gulf
region, taking part in the final day of ``Operation Desert Fox,''
the four-day U.S.-British bombing campaign against Iraq in
mid-December, and conducting repeated air strikes against Iraqi
anti-aircraft units and other sites over the next three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very challenging and a very exciting time for us,''
said Rear Adm. Al Harms, who as commander of Carrier Group 3 led
the Vinson and eight escort ships to the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks into what had appeared to be a routine cruise to
the western Pacific and Indian Ocean, Harms received urgent orders
to abandon a scheduled visit to Australia and proceed directly to
the Persian Gulf. In fact, the admiral said, the nuclear-powered
carrier and two cruisers went ``ballistic'' for the last 2,000
miles, traveling non-stop at speeds in excess of 30 knots. The
ships sprinted through the Strait of Hormuz on Dec. 18, and
launched warplanes against Iraq the next night, he said. Two escort
ships fired Tomahawk cruise missiles at other Iraqi targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We proved the concept of `ready on arrival' by being fully
ready, flexible, mobile and self-sustainable,'' Harms said.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier left Bremerton with 300 vacancies, nearly 10 percent
of the crew roster. However, as the deployment continued,
replacement personnel steadily arrived and by the end of the cruise
the ship and its air wing were at full strength, the admiral said.
</P>
<P>
   He credited new naval communications systems with enabling his
staff to be prepared for complex air strikes on short notice. ``We
were fully integrated'' with the U.S. Central Command headquarters
and were able to receive detailed operational plans, satellite
images and other intelligence data as the Vinson sprinted toward
the combat zone, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The capability did not exist during the Persian Gulf War, when
the Navy could not talk directly to the other military services,
and daily targeting orders had to be photocopied and flown to the
carriers from Saudi Arabia, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Harms said he and Capt. David Crocker, the Vinson's commanding
officer, were especially proud of two facts: The carrier lost no
aircraft to hostile fire or accidents despite thousands of flights
conducted during the cruise, and there were no fatalities among the
combined ship and air wing crew of 5,000 personnel. Moreover, the
Carl Vinson was awarded the Battle E award recognizing it as the
outstanding carrier in the U.S Pacific Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Another recent high-technology innovation greatly helped crew
morale during the six-month separation from family members, Vinson
sailors said.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Internet and satellite telephone services, crew
members and their families were in nearly continuous contact via
e-mail and direct telephone services.
</P>
<P>
   Electrician's Mate 1st Class William LeVasseur III said he and
his wife, Susan, kept in daily contact throughout the deployment,
which meant much to him because she is pregnant with their second
child. Such a connection was unheard of when he joined the Navy 16
years ago, LeVasseur said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You used to have to write a letter and it took 2-3 weeks to
get there,'' he recalled. ``And it took another 2-3 weeks to get an
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   For Aviation Ordnanceman Senior Chief Bill Sinyard, the
communications linking sailors and families kept crew morale
strong. ``This makes the work go by quicker and the days go by
easier,'' said Sinyard, a veteran of nine deployments.
</P>
<P>
   First off the ship upon arrival were about 50 sailors who had
become parents during the six months at sea. They were met by a
delegation of new mothers pushing strollers on the crowded pier.

TWO CRUISE LINES WILL BASE VESSELS IN SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ARTHUR C. GORLICK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For years, the Port of Seattle and the region's
business leaders battled futilely to get a cruise ship line to
operate from the city's waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two cruise ship lines say they will base vessels here.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean International announced Thursday that next year
it will become the second cruise ship line to operate at the Port
of Seattle's Bell Street Pier facilities at Pier 66.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami-based cruise line said it will base its
2,000-passenger Vision of the Seas in Seattle for voyages through
Puget Sound, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, the San Juan Islands and
Canada's Inside Passage to Vancouver and Victoria, B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian Cruise Line announced last year that it will operate
21 seven-day summer cruises to Alaska aboard its 2,000-passenger
Norwegian Sky from Seattle's Bell Street Pier terminal beginning
May 7, 2000, under a four-year agreement with the port.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that cruising is an ideal way to really experience
this part of the country, which boasts spectacular scenery and
wonderful ports of call,'' said Jack Williams, president of Royal
Caribbean International.
</P>
<P>
   Port of Seattle officials said that each vessel call will pump
nearly $1 million into the community. The two cruise lines are
expected to create 400 new jobs, produce $74 million in business
revenues and generate $8.4 million in state and local taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Besides longshore and stevedore jobs, the cruise ships directly
create jobs for ticketing and reservations agents and business for
provisioners of bunker fuel, food and a range of items and services
that include flowers and piano tuners.
</P>
<P>
   Port of Seattle commissioners have authorized construction of a
$12.9 million cruise terminal at the Bell Street Pier facility,
which contained only a shell for a cruise terminal when the $110
million, 11-acre pier opened in July 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Royal Caribbean is using the seven cruises next year as a test
of the itineraries in the new market,'' said port spokesman Imbert
Matthee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this works out well, we assume they will go for a longer
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean will launch its Port of Seattle operations with
a one-night cruise for travel agents on May 14, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   On May 15, 22 and 29, 2000, it will have four-night cruises into
British Columbia. On May 19 and 26, it will have three-night
cruises and on June 2, 2000, a two-night cruise.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian Cruise Line's lease gives it exclusive use of the
port's cruise ship terminal on Sundays, a preferred day for
departure.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean will operate its Vision of the Seas voyages on
Mondays and Fridays, Matthee said.
</P>
<P>
   Large vessel cruising from the Port of Seattle had been stymied
for years by the 1886 Passenger Service Act, which bars
foreign-registered cruise ships from stopping at more than one U.S.
port per voyage to pick up or drop off passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the law's restrictions, cruise lines have operated
extensively from Vancouver, B.C., with many cruise ship passengers
arriving at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and being bused to
Vancouver. Vancouver's harbor has become increasingly crowded with
cruise ships.
</P>
<P>
   The Port of Seattle and Greater Seattle Chamber of Commerce
unsuccessfully backed efforts to get Congress to change the law,
but the two cruise lines that will operate here have found ways
around the limitations.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Caribbean cruises will stop at two Canadian ports
before completing a round-trip voyage to Seattle, complying with
the 113-year-old law.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegian Cruise Line voyages will stop at Alaskan ports,
but won't drop off passengers before heading back to Seattle with a
stop in Vancouver, B.C., also under the law's provisions.

 By JEROME SOLOMON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich did not know it when he scoured the
list of prospects before the NBA draft last June.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Barkley did not know it when he re-signed with the
Rockets, shunning several teams waving millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   And Scottie Pippen surely did not know it when he decided not to
go down with the NBA's version of the Titanic, choosing instead to
head south for the winter to become a Rocket after spending the
first 11 years of his career winning championships in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   No, not even Michael Dickerson and Cuttino Mobley knew that when
the 1999 NBA season shifted into overdrive, as it does every year
when the playoffs begin, they would be the starting backcourt for
the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   But they are.
</P>
<P>
   Two rookies are charged with helping the Rockets return to the
top of the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   They get their first playoff test Saturday in Los Angeles when
the Rockets take on the Lakers in a matchup of the Nos. 4 and 5
seeds from the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to it,'' Dickerson said. ``I'm curious.
The veterans have talked about how different the playoffs are from
the regular season, and I can't wait to experience it.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA lockout aside, Dickerson didn't have to wait long to go
from college star to professional. He was snapped up by the Rockets
with their first pick (14th overall) in the 1998 draft, and then
when the labor agreement was reached he was dropped into the
starting lineup at shooting guard before the regular season began.
</P>
<P>
   It took Mobley, who did not play in the season opener at Los
Angeles, 10 games to find himself thrust into a starting role at
point guard. After a brief interruption, he has made himself at
home with 33 consecutive starts.
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich said he had no long-range plans when he plugged
Mobley into the starting lineup Feb. 21, forming the all-rookie
backcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even think about them being rookies. Honestly, I was
just doing what I thought was best for the team,'' Tomjanovich
said.
</P>
<P>
   So what might seem like a bold, maybe even questionable move was
a no-brainer to Tomjanovich _ he was trying to win games. The two
have responded, combining for more than 20 points per game, with
Dickerson leading the team in 3-point shooting at 43 percent and
Mobley near the top with 82 percent free-throw shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, who has been part of six NBA championship teams, had no
reservations about the rookie starters, though when he was traded
to the Rockets he expected Rodrick Rhodes, a second-year player who
has since been traded, to be a starter.
</P>
<P>
   But shortly after his arrival in Houston, Pippen said he saw
something from the rookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't take long,'' Pippen said. ``During the exhibition
games, I realized that they play with a lot of confidence, a lot of
tenacity, a lot of love for the game, and they work very hard. So I
was impressed then. They're not just average rookies, I don't
think. They have a lot to bring to the table for you.''
</P>
<P>
   They bring it on different plates, or so it seems.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson is the quiet sort, though with guys like Barkley and
Antoine Carr sharing the locker room, a chainsaw could go
unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   But that is OK with Dickerson, who shies from the media
spotlight _ literally. After three months of dealing with it, he
finally let on Thursday that shyness is not his problem; the bright
camera lights hurt his sensitive eyes. He has just been too polite
to tell the television cameramen that. It might be too late now.
</P>
<P>
   After pouring in 58 points in the last two regular-season games,
the South Carolina-born 23-year-old, who attended high school in
Seattle and college at Arizona, will draw much attention when the
Rockets roll into Los Angeles this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   He just doesn't know it yet.
</P>
<P>
   Mobley, who answers to the nickname ``Cat,'' is a cool customer.
Though he went to high school in Maine and played college ball at
Rhode Island, he is more suited to the in-your-face hoops stylings
found in his hometown of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Confident and rarely shaken, Mobley, who posted 18 points in
each of the last two games, is even a bit surprised by his early
success in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really think about anything big. I just came in (to
training camp) trying to get a spot on the team,'' Mobley said.
``Fortunately, I've started. I'm just happy to be here, that's
all.''
</P>
<P>
   And Tomjanovich, for one, is happy he is here as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was (about) survival,'' Tomjanovich said of the insertion
of Mobley into the starting lineup. ``I just picked a guy that I
thought could do a job defensively, and he came in and handled the
job. Then I went back and tried to do it with other combinations,
and I felt that with Cuttino in the lineup was the best way to
start.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Mobley: ``I appreciate it tremendously that he believes in
me, and I don't want to let him down. That helps me play better.''
</P>
<P>
   It also helps that opponents remain willing to leave Dickerson
and Mobley wandering unguarded on the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be like that for a while,'' Mobley said. ``For
right now, we're the guys they come off of until we prove
ourselves. And hopefully, like it has lately, it will continue to
work to our advantage. That's what we're out there for.''
</P>
<P>
   They have come through often enough that good play is more of an
expectation than a surprise. They even have Hakeem Olajuwon, the
team's leading scorer, saying he is counting on them to continue to
lead the way as long as the shots are there and they maintain their
groove.
</P>
<P>
   Each is confident they can pull it off, even if a few months ago
they didn't know they would have to do it from the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always have confidence in myself; I may not have confidence
in my shot all the time, but I always have confidence in myself,''
Dickerson said. ``I worked extremely hard in the summer to be able
to step in and contribute right away. But to have the type season
that I'm having, no, I never thought I could do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had some downs during the season, but to have the season
I am having, I thank God every morning when I wake up.''
</P>
<P>
   If opponents don't wake up and recognize Dickerson and Mobley
for the players they are, teams might not have much of a prayer of
stopping the Rockets. &QL;

A LONG DAY IN COURT FOR 1 IMMIGRANT AND 5 POLICE OFFICERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He looked small and frail in a dark blue suit that
seemed three sizes too large. Abner Louima gazed across the packed
courtroom. He blinked several times, and his dark eyes seemed to
widen at the sight of so many faces focused entirely on him.
</P>
<P>
   Then he took the witness stand to give his account of vicious
abuse by New York City police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Louima told of officers who held him face down in a precinct
house bathroom, rammed a stick into his rectum, then threatened to
kill him and his family if he ever breathed a word of what
happened.
</P>
<P>
   A prosecutor asked Louima what he was doing when a police
officer allegedly removed the stick from Louima's rectum and thrust
it into his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was crying,'' Louima replied quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the moment when Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Vinegrad
asked Louima to look around the court and identify the officer who,
prosecutors charge, inserted the stick into Louima's rectum.
</P>
<P>
   Louima stood and methodically searched the courtroom with his
eyes. ``He's right there,'' he said. At the prosecutor's prodding,
Louima pointed a shaking finger at Officer Justin Volpe, who did
not visibly react.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe is one of five New York City police officers on trial this
week in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn in the alleged assault of
Louima. They have denied all the charges, and their lawyers have
said Louima is fabricating the assault to win millions of dollars
in a civil suit against the city.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was the first day that Louima appeared on the witness
stand. He answered prosecutors' questions about the alleged assault
and questions from defense lawyers about seeming inconsistencies in
his account. He recounted the months of pain as he recovered from
extensive internal damage. He recalled how, before he was wheeled
into surgery, a doctor asked him to drink some fluid, only to feel
it immediately pass through his body.
</P>
<P>
   An immigrant from Haiti, Louima has a voice so heavily accented
that Vinegrad asked him again and again to repeat his answers.
During most of his three and a half hours on the stand, he
maintained his composure, and there were moments of humor. At one
point, Louima described how, on the night of the alleged assault,
which followed his arrest in a street brawl, he danced with several
women at Club Rendez-vous on Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn while his
wife was at home.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, prosecutors presented Louima to jurors in a
manner clearly intended to undercut some of the major defense
arguments. Defense lawyers contend that Louima was injured through
consensual sex with a man.
</P>
<P>
   Vinegrad asked Louima about his wife of three years, and about
his two children. Then he asked if his wife was expecting another
child. Yes, Louima replied, later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also raised some blemishes in Louima's background
that defense lawyers are sure to explore as they try to attack
Louima's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Louima admitted to jurors that he failed to report as much as
$10,000 he earned while working as a used-car salesman, and that he
lied when he told reporters that police officers had tauntingly
told him, ``It's Giuliani time,'' a reference to the pro-police
administration of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers immediately seized on those failings as they
began their questioning of Louima, which will continue next week.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the day was devoted to questions from prosecutors,
who repeatedly drew Louima back to the events of that August night
in 1997, back to what he described as one humiliation after another
at the hands of police officers. At one point, Louima said, they
ridiculed his command of English, telling him to go back to his
country.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he testified, another sort of immigrant experience was
being played out Thursday in the same building, as hundreds of men
and women gathered in another federal courtroom to be sworn in as
U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country embraces you and protects you,'' said Judge
Allyne Ross. ``My hope for all of you and your children is that you
share to the fullest in the American dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone applauded, oblivious to the man in the baggy blue suit
sitting four floors above.

GREENE KNUCKLES DOWN WITH SPARKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Steve Sparks has found a new partner. which is not
easy for a knuckleball pitcher to do. Most catchers don't
particularly enjoy spending a game flagging down fluttering pitches
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Phil Nevin became Sparks' batterymate, but when
Nevin was traded to the San Diego Padres just before the start of
the season, Sparks was left with no one in particular to be his
catcher. That has changed. Todd Greene has become Sparks' personal
catcher, and with good reason.
</P>
<P>
   In Sparks' first four starts, either Matt Walbeck or Charlie
O'Brien caught him and he went 0-3 with a 6.75 ERA. In his past two
starts with Greene behind the plate, Sparks is 1-0 with a 1.15 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when you've got a catcher who has caught his whole
life, it's more difficult to catch a knuckleball pitcher,'' said
Greene, who was an outfielder in college. ``Converted catchers
might have it easier because you're not so set in your ways and you
allow the pitch to come to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene caught Sparks on Wednesday and Sparks got his first
victory of the year _ eight innings, one run, three hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called a good game,'' Anaheim Angels manager Terry Collins
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My rhythm's been a lot smoother because I've been throwing
strikes,'' Sparks said of his past few starts. ``Obviously I give
(Greene) a lot of credit because he's been doing a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Injury reports: Second baseman Randy Velarde was scratched from
Thursday's game because of a stiff lower back. Velarde had started
all of the Angels' first 28 games before Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Tim Salmon, who sprained his left wrist last
Monday, was sent to Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit for an MRI test.
Results are expected to be released today.

COLUMBIA ANNOUNCES PLANS FOR SOAP CITY, SOAP OPERA CABLE CHANNEL   
()
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Sony Corp.'s Columbia television studio on
Thursday became the second owner of hit network soap operas to
announce plans for a soap opera cable channel.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbia Tristar Television Group said it would initiate a
cable channel called Soap City next January, the same month when
ABC, owned by the Walt Disney Co., plans to begin its own soap
opera channel.
</P>
<P>
   Like ABC, Columbia plans to rely on same-day repeats of soap
operas it owns, in this case ``Days of Our Lives,'' the
highest-rated soap opera on NBC. Columbia also has an interest in
several other soaps, most prominently ``The Young and the
Restless'' on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   But CBS retains the rights to broadcast all its soap operas
exclusively, a right that has become a point of dispute in the
increasing friction between several networks and their affiliated
stations.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's decision to start up a soap channel, repeating in prime
time the episodes of soaps like ``General Hospital,'' was strongly
opposed by ABC's affiliated stations. NBC's affiliates vocally
objected when the network decided to use material from news
programs like ``Dateline: NBC'' on its news channel, MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Schwartz, the senior vice president of communications for
CBS, said CBS had ``no intention'' of releasing its exclusive
rights to broadcast ``The Young and the Restless.'' CBS' contract
with Columbia on that show has two years to run. NBC's deal with
Columbia for ``Days of Our Lives'' allowed for the episodes to be
repeated.
</P>
<P>
   Two Columbia executives, Jon Feltheimer, the president of
Columbia Tristar Television, and Andy Kaplan, the executive vice
president, both said in interviews Thursday that they would welcome
the idea of adding CBS and NBC as partners in the new soap channel.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan noted that Columbia had experimented for a year with
selling same-day repeats of ``Days of Our Lives'' on a pay-per-view
basis to viewers with the Hughes Electronic's satellite service
DirecTV. ``We were encouraged by the results,'' Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   Feltheimer said the channel would also contain other programming
of interest to soap fans, including perhaps repeats of prime-time
serial dramas like ``Party of Five,'' which Columbia owns, and the
soap ``Santa Barbara,'' which was canceled by NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan also pointed to the success of a soap Web site
established by Columbia, also called Soap City, and said the new
channel and the Web site would be closely linked. ``We're going to
expand the Web site and pump investment into it,'' Kaplan said.
``It'll be an ongoing convergence, including video streaming of
programming from the cable channel on the Web site.''

MACHON IS JUST THE STAR FOR GALAXY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There has been speculation since former UCLA coach
Sigi Schmid became the Los Angeles Galaxy coach April 21 that
former midfielder Martin Machon would return to the team.
</P>
<P>
   Machon's contract was loaned to Santos of Mexico for the summer
and winter seasons because the Guatemalan couldn't get along with
former Galaxy coach Octavio Zambrano. It was a costly move that
Major League Soccer didn't want to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly would not have loaned him if Los Angeles had told
us that was not their desire,'' said MLS executive vice president
Ivan Gazidis. ``If the Galaxy is interested in getting him back,
you'd have to ask them. He's on loan with Mexico until the end of
the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy general manager Sergio Del Prado says he has already
expressed his interest in re-acquiring the central defensive
midfielder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have actually approached the league with that suggestion,''
Del Prado said. ``We hope there is a way to get him back, but we're
not optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Valda-drama: Those who criticize MLS' single-entity concept must
be laughing at the way Commissioner Doug Logan handled Carlos
Valderrama's personal dispute with the Miami Fusion.
</P>
<P>
   Fusion coach Ivo Wortman benched the Columbian standout early in
the season because he refused to follow game plans. After that,
both Wortman and Valderrama agreed that they could not work
together.
</P>
<P>
   Miami looked to trade Valderrama and secure the best deal
possible for its club, but Logan grew impatient and stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   Since the league owns the players' contracts, Logan simply moved
Valderrama to Tampa Bay without compensating Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became apparent that there was no possibility of a trade
materializing within any reasonable time frame that would be
satisfactory both to Miami and another MLS team,'' Logan said. ``I
have therefore decided, under the powers vested in me as
commissioner of MLS, to reassign the service of Mr. Valderrama from
Miami to Tampa Bay.''
</P>
<P>
   Incredible.
</P>
<P>
   Especially since Logan is not in charge of player contracts. One
man cannot play general manager for the entire league, especially
if he's supposed to be an impartial commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Rough exchange: Major League Soccer referees have taken a public
beating from players, coaches, general managers and the media since
the league's inception in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   First, it was American officials who were scorned, prompting MLS
to agree to a referee exchange program with foreign FIFA officials
two years ago. MLS executives hoped American referees would gain
valuable experience in other top leagues around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the foreign refs MLS received in the exchange are also
being criticized.
</P>
<P>
   In D.C. United's 3-2 loss to Chicago last week, Scottish referee
Stuart Dougal handed out a league-record 10 yellow cards and
ejected three players.
</P>
<P>
   It made United general manager Kevin Payne so upset that he lost
his cool afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I generally try to be pretty quiet on the quality of
officiating,'' Payne said. ``But I thought what we witnessed out
there was an absolute travesty. I don't understand why we need to
go 4,000 miles to get a referee that poor. This referee clearly has
no respect for our league and he should be sent home. I'll be happy
to pay for his flight.''
</P>
<P>
   Those remarks earned Payne a $15,000 fine, the second-largest in
the league's four-year history. Only New England midfielder Edwin
Gorter has paid more, when he was tagged for $20,000 last season
after a racially-charged fight with a teammate.
</P>
<P>
   Payne suggested that foreign officials do not respect the level
of MLS play, especially since most are accustomed to officiating in
Europe and South America. Those comments upset MLS officials, who
responded during a conference call Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A team like D.C. United that goes into the InterAmerca Cup and
plays against Vasco de Gama (Brazil) and also games in the CONCACAF
club championships brings respect from referees who are doing games
in other places,'' said Esse Baharmast, U.S. soccer director of
officials. ``Yes, we are not the (German) Bundesliga, but
(referees) have respect for the level of play and the technical
ability of our players.
</P>
<P>
   ``All over the world, there are different kinds of referees. It
seems that because Dougal gave a lot of cards that there is some
lack of respect.... I don't think that's the case. He seems to be
very technical and his method of solving problems on the field is a
quick card.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the exchange program will continue.

NEW JERSEY DELIVERY SERVICE WITH EXPANSION PLANS ACQUIRES RIVAL
WESTWIND EXPRESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Westwind Express, a delivery service based in
Ventura County north of Los Angeles, with seven locations
nationwide, has been purchased by an East Coast rival.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidated Delivery &AMP; Logistics of Clifton, N.J., bought
Westwind for $5.5 million to expand its operations on the West
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to grow dramatically _ from Seattle to San Diego,''
said Drew Kronick, a vice president at Consolidated. ``Westwind has
an exceptional reputation in the marketplace and a history of very
strong profitability.''
</P>
<P>
   Westwind co-founder Steven Keihner said he and his father James
decided to sell. The Keihners had received other buyout offers but
chose Consolidated because the company gave them a better deal and
they liked the management. Consolidated also had an aura of
professionalism and sophistication not often seen in the courier
services industry, Keihner said.
</P>
<P>
   Four-year-old Consolidated had 1998 sales of $185.7 million,
growing mainly through acquisitions. Westwind, a 15-year-old firm
with $7 million in annual sales and 250 employees, is
Consolidated's 24th purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Westwind will not be laying off any people or closing its
offices in Van Nuys, Palmdale, Ontario, Fresno, Sacramento, Kansas
City and Lexena, Mo., as a result of the purchase. However,
Westwind will be renamed Consolidated.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Keihner will become Consolidated's West Coast regional
manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can grow with them,'' said the 38-year-old Keihner.
</P>
<P>
   On the West Coast, Consolidated has offices in Los Angeles,
Burlingame, Santa Rosa and Seattle. It employs 3,500.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Consolidated increased 18.75 cents to $3.3125, or 6
percent, on 20,100 shares traded, more than double the 20-day
average volume.

<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SO now they must do it the long, hard way.
</P>
<P>
   Again.
</P>
<P>
   They have emphasized in the past week they are not the old
Rockets, and yet they enter the playoffs following a familiar path.
</P>
<P>
   The road.
</P>
<P>
   Like Sherpas trekking toward the summit of Mount Everest, they
know their way to the top. They also know getting there can be
difficult. Pack the oxygen tanks and the crampons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put ourselves in this position,'' Scottie Pippen said with
a shrug. ``I wish I could say that it doesn't matter. But it
does.''
</P>
<P>
   It matters because there is little margin for error along this
route. It matters because a team that has been largely unsuccessful
away from home through this makeshift season now will have to pull
more than its share of victories out of the luggage.
</P>
<P>
   It means everybody must concentrate. It means the part of the
Rockets' game that has often been their weakest will be put to the
test _ their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to play smart,'' Pippen said. ``Honestly, there have
been a lot of times this season when we haven't done that. Nights
when the shots weren't falling when we didn't do the other things _
defense and taking care of the ball _ that can still get you wins
in those situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider that the Rockets' most significant win away from home
this season came April 12 at Minnesota. It is the only time all
year they won a road game against a team without a losing record.
The Timberwolves finished 25-25, exactly .500.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the mood inside the locker room at Denver's McNichols
Arena was by no means funereal as the Rockets sat watching a tiny
TV screen as the Lakers thumped Portland to wrap up the home-court
advantage in the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are worse places to spend the weekend than LA,'' Charles
Barkley said. ``And the truth is that if this team still has the
belief that it can win a championship _ and I'm telling you it does
_ then we're going to have to win on the road eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   Having seen this team ride a roller coaster of emotion and
effort all season, the deeper truth is that opening at the Great
Western Forum in front of Jack Nicholson and the Laker Girls might
be just the prescription to cure the Rockets' road woes.
</P>
<P>
   After those two fateful visits by the Dallas Mavericks over the
past two weeks, who is sure about the Rockets' chances of defending
their home court in the first two games anyway?
</P>
<P>
   They have a tendency to drift mentally and let teams settle into
a comfort zone against them. They have a bad habit of getting
sloppy physically, committing turnovers on offense and playing soft
on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the ups and the downs we've experienced, this is still
a team with a lot of confidence in what it can do,'' Pippen said.
``It's a team that plays very well when it wants to or needs to. It
seems like we need a challenge, and there's no bigger challenge
than the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The impressive April wins over Portland and the Lakers are proof
the Rockets have the ability.
</P>
<P>
   There is no bigger opportunity than in the first two games in
LA, where the Lakers are just as big a question mark, one huge
dysfunctional family that has, at times, made the Rockets look like
a model for success.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Rodman and his distractions are gone, but the Lakers
still carry so much excess baggage. Can Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe
Bryant find a way to coexist with only one basketball and two
different views of who should shoot it?
</P>
<P>
   Can the Lakers succeed in the playoffs without their best
perimeter defender, Eddie Jones, who was shipped off to Charlotte
with Elden Campbell to bring in yet another shooter? Can first-year
coach Kurt Rambis get any of his players to even look in his
direction, let alone listen, when he draws up plays in a timeout?
</P>
<P>
   If you're the Rockets, you have to view this as more of an
opportunity than a daunting obstacle. What would happen to the
Lakers if the Rockets were to ``steal'' one of the first two games
in LA? Would Shaq squash Kobe like a grape? Would they fracture
from disharmony?
</P>
<P>
   The truth is the home-court advantage does not become
overwhelming until the final game of any series, and in a five-game
set the pressure to defend it at the outset might actually be
greater.
</P>
<P>
   At least that is the Rockets' hope, because it's now the only
option at their disposal.
</P>
<P>
   The familiar way. The long, hard way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only six teams in the playoffs with a chance to win
it all,'' Barkley said. ``Two in the East, Indiana and Miami, and
four in the West. You've got Utah, San Antonio, Portland and us. We
belong on that list.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course. Now all they have to do is prove it.

A FRIEND IN NEED . . . COULD BE A BANK ROBBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Lenore Atagi was just doing a favor for
friends. What a favor.
</P>
<P>
   Atagi, 18, of Independence, had driven two friends to an Army
recruiting center. On the way home, one friend asked to stop at a
bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, he gets in the van and yells, `Roll out! Roll
out!' '' Atagi said.
</P>
<P>
   She said he mentioned something about 15 G's, ``And I thought,
`Oh no, you didn't just rob a bank.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Officials say he did. He and the other man are expected to be
charged today, FBI spokesman Jeff Lanza said.
</P>
<P>
   They said they don't think Atagi was involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``This woman realized something was going on, there was a large
sum of money involved, and she didn't want any part of it,'' said
Gladstone Detective Dave Smith.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning Atagi agreed to take her two friends to the
recruiting center. On the way there they stopped at Hillcrest Bank
to ask for directions.
</P>
<P>
   After visiting the recruiting center, one friend said he wanted
to go back to the bank. So Atagi made the stop.
</P>
<P>
   As she drove away, she heard sirens. When she saw police behind
her, she pulled into a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically turned us in,'' Atagi said.
</P>
<P>
   Police took the three in for questioning, but let Atagi go
later.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said money was found in the van.
</P>
<P>
   Atagi said she realized later that more was at stake than
friendship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still can't believe it happened,'' she said. ``Through this
whole thing, it was my life on the line and I didn't even know it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not how I expected my day to go.''

COURT RULES PASTOR CAN'T BE FORCED TO TESTIFY IN MURDER CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELAINE PORTERFIELD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A state Supreme Court ruling Thursday that a Tacoma,
Wash., pastor cannot be forced to testify about an alleged murder
confession protects the sanctity of the confessional, supporters
said.
</P>
<P>
   The high court unanimously dismissed a Pierce County Superior
Court's contempt charge against the Rev. Rich Hamlin, ruling that
he was protected by a state law that guarantees the confidentiality
of religious confessions.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the ruling significantly broadened legal
protections to any religion, regardless of whether a religion has a
recognized right of confession.
</P>
<P>
   Theologians were buoyed by the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (ruling) will be the latest authority on the subject in
the country,'' said Steve McFarland, director of the Virginia-based
Christian Legal Society. ``It will be hopefully a beacon light to
warn other prosecutors away from this unconstitutional sandbar.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamlin, the ordained minister of the 75-member Evangelical
Reformed Church in South Tacoma, was ecstatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just thrilled that the state Supreme Court has ruled and
ruled decisively,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the state Court of Appeals sided with Hamlin in a
3-0 vote, ruling the law protects clergy members if they believe
they are hearing a confession out of a religious obligation. The
high court's decision affirms the Appeals Court.
</P>
<P>
   But the Washington Supreme Court ruling does come with a caveat:
The privilege enjoyed by a pastor who hears a confession could be
nullified if there is a third party present _ something that could
affect the case at hand.
</P>
<P>
   The case revolves around the death two years ago of 3-month-old
Devyn Martin. Pierce County prosecutors charged Devyn's father,
Scott Anthony Martin, with second-degree murder, saying he shook
his son to death in a fit of frustration.
</P>
<P>
   To try him, they said they needed to call Hamlin as a witness.
They believe Martin confessed the slaying to Hamlin, who met with
Martin three times after the baby died.
</P>
<P>
   But Hamlin refused to testify, claiming that to do so would
violate the privacy protecting what a penitent tells him in
confidence. Pierce County Superior Court Judge Brian Tollefson
found him in contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Martin has been in custody since he was charged in 1997; his
bail was set at $250,000. His trial was put on hold while the high
court reviewed Hamlin's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce County Prosecutor John Ladenburg said state law before
Thursday's ruling only protected confessions between a penitent and
clergy in a religion with a recognized right of confession, such as
the Roman Catholic or Episcopal churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing they (state justices) did, which is very
significant, is say that it's up to the priest to decide if it's a
confession, as opposed to another statement that is
non-confessional in nature,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ladenburg noted, however, that the high court also said that
having a third party present during the confession could negate the
priest-penitent privilege.
</P>
<P>
   In Martin's case, his mother was present as least during part of
his conversations with Hamlin, Ladenburg said. The mother has told
authorities she doesn't remember what she heard Hamlin and her son
discuss.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also believe that yet another person was present
when the pastor spoke with Martin a third time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have evidence that at least two of the three times someone
else was present'' during the conversations, Ladenburg said.
``We'll give whatever evidence we have to the judge and say, `What
do you want to do now?'''
</P>
<P>
   Steven O'Ban, Hamlin's attorney, said a hearing will be held
shortly for a judge to explore that question.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as what will happen at the evidentiary hearing, I'm not
in a position to guess,'' O'Ban said. ``But I am confident the
judge will not force Pastor Hamlin to testify.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Maddox, a theology professor at Seattle Pacific
University, said the court's ruling affirms an important religious
right that dates to the earliest days of the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``If parishioners did not have the confidence (his confession)
would remain confidential, it would remove an important tool of
spiritual life,'' Maddox said. ``The promise that whatever is
revealed remains private ... goes back very far in the Christian
tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Said the Christian Legal Society's McFarland: ``The court has
protected the sanctity of the confessional. You can confide in your
clergy with the assurance what you say will stay between you and
God.
</P>
<P>
   ``Troubled people can unburdened their consciousness to clergy
without worrying their pastor will become the government's
snitch.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THE Astros had a dreadful spring, and they have subsequently lost
two starters to injuries, after having subtracted no less of a
luminary than Moises Alou from the every-day mix until, at the
earliest, late August.
</P>
<P>
   Also, prodigal son/cleanup hitter Ken Caminiti is only now
completing what would constitute a spring training's worth of
preparation and conditioning, having wasted most of his Florida
laid low by a stubborn sinus infection.
</P>
<P>
   By all rights, the Astros should be treading water. Instead,
they're swimming like Mark Spitz. If 17-10 doesn't sound
impressive, consider that, over the course of a season, it
extrapolates to 102-60.
</P>
<P>
   That W-L ratio should ring familiar to you. It, of course, is
the franchise record they compiled last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are doing everything well and can offer up a broad
statistical sampler to prove it. They lead the National League in
hitting, slugging and on-base percentage, with their batting
average a lofty nine points higher than anyone else's. They are
second in stolen bases with 32, and just two teams have committed
fewer errors or converted more double plays.
</P>
<P>
   Astros pitchers have given up one more earned run than Atlanta's
perennial NL leaders; their opponents' on-base percentage is
second-lowest to the Mets. Their 12 saves converted in 13
opportunities ranks first by a comfortable margin, with Billy
Wagner's 10-for-10 as perfect as it gets.
</P>
<P>
   And coming off a 5-1 Florida-New York swing, they're 10-4 away
from the Astrodome, the best traveling record in the major leagues.
No road toads, these guys.
</P>
<P>
   Need a negative? OK, their 7-6 standing in this Dome farewell
celebration could use marked improvement, but three games starting
tonight against Montreal (8-18) and three with middling Pittsburgh
offer a good opportunity to get that apparent aberration righted as
well.
</P>
<P>
   And, true, they are a ``lowly'' fifth in runs scored, meaning
they're leaving a tad too many men on base (7.7 per game).
</P>
<P>
   But let's not quibble here. Grading on the curve, which means
taking into account the fact one-third of the starting lineup is
off line, they're off to a remarkable start, one of the best in
franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   Can it last? First let me say it had better because the Central
Division appears significantly stronger than it has been in the
Astros' past two championship seasons. But, yes, it can, absolutely
_ as long as more players don't stagger off to the infirmary. Depth
remains a potential problem, particularly with the farm system
having been hammered by injuries.
</P>
<P>
   But the ever-worrisome health variable notwithstanding, what
favors the odds of such a solid run continuing is there have been
no fluke heroes. The stars carrying the Astros are the ones who are
supposed to be, hence there's no reason to expect them to tail off
precipitously as the months drag on. They are proven commodities,
with well-documented standards of consistency.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a stiff neck, Jeff Bagwell barely could turn his head
in Florida. But he's turning heads now with nine home runs and 26
RBIs. If you multiply those numbers by six (the season is one-sixth
complete), you get 54 and 156, a monster year even in the age of
Big Mac.
</P>
<P>
   (Who, by the way, isn't on the leader board in either category.)
</P>
<P>
   Shane Reynolds, in turn, goes after his sixth victory Saturday
night, proving a lucrative contract extension doesn't necessarily
have to turn a man's head. How can Reynolds, in as impressive a
groove as we've seen him, not finally post a breakthrough 20-win
season?
</P>
<P>
   As for Jose Lima, who seeks his fifth W this evening, he's
pitching as well as he did a year ago. And much to everyone's
relief _ mercifully, he hasn't needed much of that lately _ Mike
Hampton has come around nicely after a troubling start, posting a
pair of victories and a 1.20 ERA in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   Among the starters, only 0-4 Chris Holt lags behind, yet Larry
Dierker maintains Holt has had much better stuff than his record
indicates, and who are we to argue with the skipper, he of the
lumbering gait, disarming manner and golden touch?
</P>
<P>
   Every move Dierker makes seems the right one instinctively.
Either managing a ballclub is a lot easier than baseball people
would have us believe, or the former broadcaster his partners in
the booth called ``Sluggo'' has reinvented the proverbial wheel,
having found the secret to keeping a team at once relaxed,
confident and clearly focused on the prize.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker manages for results, not effect. He checks his ego at
the clubhouse door. He neither beats a team up nor beats it down.
He simply lets players play, and when you have as many good ones as
the Astros, the results follow accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in their undermanned state, these Astros are
overachieving. At full force, they could be awesome.
</P>
<P>
   Randy who? Roger who?

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Offer a person incentive, and almost anything is possible. Even a
pitcher coming up with a hit.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once a reliever in the American League, Jose Lima didn't even
own a wooden bat, much less use one, for several seasons. The
feeling of baseball people has long been that pitchers get paid to
pitch, not hit. In Lima's case, it depends on how you look at it.
</P>
<P>
   With his move to the National League and the Astros before the
1997 season, Lima finally found out what the other side was like. A
relative even bet Lima $5,000 last season, his first as a full-time
starter, that he couldn't get at least one hit.
</P>
<P>
   Lima got his first major-league hit May 10, 1998, the first of
11 he collected last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't need the money, but I just wanted to prove I could do
it,'' Lima said.
</P>
<P>
   For most pitchers, success is measured in victories, innings and
earned run average _ not doubles, home runs and RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   But through 27 games, Astros pitchers have become almost as
dependable at the plate as on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Reynolds was the first NL starter to win five games. He
also has five runs batted in. Mike Hampton has won his last two
starts, getting two hits in the process. Sean Bergman, who
possesses the best power potential, hit a pair of solo home runs in
consecutive starts to begin the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're bringing nine guys to the plate instead of eight,''
first baseman Jeff Bagwell said. ``As a ballclub, especially in the
National League, if your pitcher can hit, field his position, bunt
guys over and things like that, it's such an added plus to your
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swear, every time a pitcher gets a hit, something good
happens during that inning.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' pitching staff ranks a modest eighth in the NL with
a .182 batting average. The pitchers have driven in 11 runs. (The
Florida Marlins' pitching staff leads the NL with a .292 batting
average; the rest of the Marlins' lineup is hitting .249.)
</P>
<P>
   With the Astros, it has been all about timing. Of the 10 hits by
the five starting pitchers, nine have directly figured in scoring
or extended an inning.
</P>
<P>
   The highlights:
</P>
<P>
   Bergman's first homer, a solo shot, tied the Brewers in the
fifth inning April 9. The Astros won 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds' two-run double during a three-run seventh against
Arizona on April 27 helped the Astros cruise to an 11-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
   On May 1 against the Marlins, Lima's two-out blooper to right
field _ his first hit of the season _ kept a second-inning rally
alive; the Astros scored five en route to a 6-4 win.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton's two-out triple, his second in 236 career at-bats,
helped the Astros erupt for five runs in the final three innings of
Tuesday's 6-1 win over the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole staff takes pride in hitting,'' said Hampton, who is
tied with Reynolds with a .273 average. ``We know the little things
can help.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton said the more pitches the pitchers see in practice, the
greater the chance they will get a hit. On a normal day at the
Astrodome, pitchers are the first to arrive in the batting cage,
spending 20 to 30 minutes taking cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds and Hampton are considered the contact hitters of the
group, the two most likely to come up with a hit or get down a
sacrifice. ``I'm not going to strike out a lot. I'm going to put
the ball in play,'' Hampton said.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman has wowed some of his teammates with upper-deck blasts
in batting practice. He is 0-for-7 since his last hit, a homer
April 15. If he is going to hit, the pitch must be in just the
right spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it (the ball) hits his bat, he can hit it a long way,''
hitting instructor Tom McCraw said. ``He's hit some no-doubters.''
</P>
<P>
   McCraw says Lima is the most improved hitter on the staff over
the past year. While he may have just one hit in 1999, Lima has
focused on making contact and has struck out only three times in 13
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Striking out an opposing hitter is one thing; being on the
receiving end is another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to strike out. Sometimes you feel bad when you
strike out and you are a pitcher, because you want to show you can
hit,'' said Lima, who began the season 0-for-9. ``Why do you think
the crowd gives such a loud ovation when a pitcher gets a hit?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I win 20 games, I can go 0-0-0-0. They don't pay me to
hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Griffin owns the highest single-season batting average by a
pitcher in Astros history, when he hit .294 (20-for-68) in 1974.
The club record for career average for a pitcher with at least 200
at-bats is .196 (60-for-306) by Dave Giusti from 1962-68.
</P>
<P>
   The major-league record for highest batting average by a pitcher
in a season is .440 by Washington's Walter Johnson in 1925.
</P>
<P>
   Those records seem safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``They aren't going to be .300 hitters, but if they can get a
walk or make contact, those contributions can extend an inning or
ignite an inning,'' McCraw said.
</P>
<P>
   And when Astros pitchers aren't driving in runs, they are moving
runners into scoring position. Reynolds already has seven
sacrifices in six games after getting seven in 35 games in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   So with the Astros tied with the Mets 1-1 in the seventh inning
of Tuesday's game, did manager Larry Dierker consider pinch-hitting
for Hampton?
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' said Dierker, a .180 hitter during his playing
career. ``I know he can do more than most pitchers in the sense
that he can hit and run fast. He can draw walks and steal bases. He
makes plays you wouldn't believe. He's good enough where if you hit
for him, it's only a marginal upgrade. And you lose the guy who's
been shutting the other team down.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Chris Holt said, ``No pitcher is faster than him
(Hampton) in either league.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton sent a drive to the center-field wall over a drawn-in
outfield, sparking a three-run inning. He also combined with Scott
Elarton on a three-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't expect a pitcher to hit the ball 400 feet,'' said
New York center fielder Brian McRae. ``You don't normally see
pitchers hit a ball that far.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything is possible.

VAUGHN RETURNS TO BOSTON FOR FIRST TIME WITH ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ There will be no welcome-back parade for their
hometown hero, and that's just the way Mo Vaughn wants it.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn returns to Fenway Park tonight to face the Boston Red
Sox, his team in his town for eight seasons. Vaughn's dispute with
Red Sox management has been well-documented, but he is still loved
by the fans and particularly the children, for whom Vaughn has
given his time and money with the development of the Mo Vaughn
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, however, will not hold a pregame news conference. He
refuses to make more of his return than he feels it deserves. He
wants things to be as normal as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really no big deal to me,'' said Vaughn, who is staying
in his North Easton, Mass., home this weekend. ``I'm an Anaheim
Angels baseball player. That's where my heart is.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt I had good times there. But my thing is to get past
the rhetoric and play the game. I've understood for a long, long
time that nobody's bigger than the game. I want to get past the
garbage and play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn says he's got bigger concerns. Like making sure his ankle
is healthy, like swinging the bat better, like making the Angels a
winner.
</P>
<P>
   But there will be no way to avoid the initial response by the
Fenway Park fans. Angels shortstop Gary DiSarcina grew up in
Massachusetts and attended Red Sox games at Fenway as a kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't expect a real rousing ovation, but at the same time
I don't expect him to get booed,'' DiSarcina said. ``He'll get a
nice reception, but not like David Wells got at Yankee Stadium.
Because he still lives there and has roots there, he'll get a nice
little ovation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an opposing player coming in, so I don't expect too
much,'' Vaughn said. ``It would be nice (to get an ovation), but
it's not going to affect me either way.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said he feels he has nothing to prove to Red Sox
management, their fans or his ex-teammates. He wants to win, but no
more than he wants to win every game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited to play, but it's not a personal thing,'' he said.
``I don't have a vendetta against management. I'm very happy with
the move I made.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn seems to have a flair for the dramatic, and certainly
there is no better place for him to do something big than in
Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in all sincerity,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said, ``I
don't know how much of a chance they'll give him to be dramatic.
We've got to set up the opportunity. But it should be fun to watch.
They'll have big crowds all weekend. It's a great baseball town.''

KC-BASED FARMLAND, ST. PAUL'S CENEX HARVEST STATES TO MERGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC PALMER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The nation's two largest farmer-owned
cooperatives, Farmland Industries of Kansas City and Cenex Harvest
States of St. Paul, Minn., are planning to merge.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed deal would create an agribusiness behemoth with
about $17 billion in annual sales, nearly double Farmland's 1998
sales and more than four times the size of the next largest
farmers' cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   The combined operation would enter the Fortune 100 and be second
only to Sprint Corp. as the metropolitan area's largest company.
Farmland now ranks 184th on the Fortune 500 list.
</P>
<P>
   Directors for Farmland and Cenex approved pre-merger
preparations in hopes of creating an international cooperative that
would give their owner-members more muscle in the global
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The farmer needs two checks. One for his production and one
for his investment in the market from processing and value-added
work,'' said Noel Estenson, chief executive of Cenex Harvest
States.
</P>
<P>
   Estenson and H.D. Cleberg, chief executive of Farmland, would
serve as co-chief executive officers until the businesses had been
blended enough to allow for a more traditional management
structure. The reconstituted board of the combined group then would
determine leadership issues.
</P>
<P>
   Decisions on what the new entity will be called or where the
headquarters will be located are expected to be made by the end of
the year, with final approval for the merger expected by June 1,
2000.
</P>
<P>
   The cooperatives said they expect to retain large presences in
both Kansas City and St. Paul. Farmland said the proposed merger
would not affect plans to build a 1.3-million-square-foot campus
near Kansas City International Airport. The same cost benefits and
efficiencies Farmland expects from that project would be realized
by the new entity, Farmland spokeswoman Sherlyn Manson said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known what effect the merger would have on the number
of employees needed. Farmland has 16,000 employees worldwide and
2,000 employees in Kansas City. Cenex has about 5,600 employees
nationwide, about 700 in St. Paul.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the merger's benefits will be derived from
transportation efficiencies and expanded purchasing power, not from
employee reductions, officials said. Any employees who do lose
their jobs would be given assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Cleberg said the companies will use outside professionals to
help make such decisions so they are not influenced by ``emotion or
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason that our concern in this community will be
any different in the future than in the past,'' Cleberg said. ``I
mean that with sincerity. We understand the importance of a
community role. I am most fearful there will be an overreaction
that creates more nervousness than is necessary in the community
and among our employees.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first trip to the altar for Farmland and Cenex.
In late 1988, the cooperatives announced merger plans but called
off the engagement six months later.
</P>
<P>
   Things are different this time, said Cleberg, who became chief
executive of Farmland in 1991. He said the merger was a natural
transition from a growing number of joint ventures over the last 10
years that Farmland has had with Cenex and Harvest States, which
merged last year.
</P>
<P>
   Those ventures range from pet food manufacturing to marketing of
tires and batteries. In March the two announced plans to merge some
aspects of their grain businesses after Cargill Inc. and
Continental Grain, the first- and second-largest U.S. grain
companies, announced plans to merge their grain operations.
</P>
<P>
   Cleberg said he would not expect big reductions in employees
coming from the Farmland and Cenex merger. The benefits are more in
the areas of transportation and in the sourcing of grain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have about 5,000 rail cars and they have about the same.
The harvest seasons in the upper Midwest and the lower Midwest are
different, so you can see the advantages there,'' Cleberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Farmland's largest concentration of employees is in meat
processing and marketing, a business that Cenex is not in, so there
should be little effect on employees there.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason Farmland has so many more employees than Cenex,
even though their sales are about the same, is because of the
labor-intensive nature of its thriving meat processing, Cleberg
said. Farmland has 10 pork, three beef and one catfish processing
plants.
</P>
<P>
   While staff reductions may not be driving the move, one of the
prime benefits of such a merger would be the economies of scope and
scale, said Mike Cook, professor of agriculture economics at the
University of Missouri-Columbia. Cook specializes in the study of
farm cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``With advances in information and other technologies, for much
less money you can perform the same functions,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   Efficiency for the American farmer is essential, Cook said,
because other parts of the world, eastern Australia and South
American for example, now have the infrastructure in place to rival
America.
</P>
<P>
   Estenson said that the competitor for the American farmer is now
in countries such as Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the price of soybeans goes up, Brazil will plant another 10
million acres. This is why we have to be looking at how we can best
help our farmers generate income by adding to their crops.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond rating company Standard &AMP; Poor put Farmland's bonds on its
watch list after the announcement. That means the ratings could be
raised, lowered or affirmed after it evaluates the deal.

 American Century takes role in electronic stock exchange in
Britain  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES R.T. CRUMPLEY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Kansas City's American Century Investments is
joining with four other financial-service firms to buy a majority
share of a company that acts as an electronic stock exchange in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The company being acquired is Tradepoint Financial Networks PLC,
and American Century executives think it could emerge as a model
for the way stocks are bought and sold in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Buying and selling stocks on electronic exchanges is faster and
cheaper than traditional exchanges. Tradepoint can sell about 2,000
British stocks, but the consortium thinks Tradepoint can expand and
its system could be adapted to work for stocks in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see the Tradepoint investment as consistent with our
mission to lower trading costs for our investors, to promote
efficient markets and, ultimately, to increase investment returns
for our mutual fund shareholders,'' said Harold Bradley, senior
vice president of American Century.
</P>
<P>
   American Century manages about $85 billion for its 2 million
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium is being led by Instinet Corp., a subsidiary of
Reuters Group PLC. An Instinet executive, Richard Kilsby, will
become chief executive of Tradepoint.
</P>
<P>
   The other members of the consortium are Archipelago, an
electronic communications network partly owned by the investment
banking firm Goldman Sachs and the online investing service ETrade,
and J.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co., both of which
are financial-services firms.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium's stake amounts to about $22 million and will
equal 55 percent of Tradepoint's stock.

LITTON BIDS TO BE TOP MILITARY SHIPBUILDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX AND BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Litton Industries Inc. has made unsolicited bids
totaling nearly $2 billion for two big shipbuilding companies,
officials said late Thursday, in deals that would turn the defense
contractor based in Woodland Hills in Los Angeles' San Fernando
Valley into the nation's preeminent military ship contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Litton made a $1.25 billion bid for Newport News Shipbuilding
Inc. of Newport News, Va., and a $503.9 million offer for Avondale
Industries Inc. of Avondale, La. Officials of both companies said
they would consider the offers.
</P>
<P>
   If the deals are accepted, the combined company would have
58,000 employees and annual revenue of $7.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The huge proposed deals, revealed early Thursday evening, are
surprising because Avondale had earlier agreed to be acquired by
Newport News.
</P>
<P>
   Litton's offer comes only about two weeks after the Defense
Department rejected General Dynamics Corp.'s $1.4 billion
unsolicited bid for Newport News Shipbuilding. Saying the potential
cost savings did not justify the deal, Pentagon officials feared
giving one company so much control over the nation's military ship
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of the Defense Department announcement April 14,
General Dynamics withdrew its offer.
</P>
<P>
   A proposed deal between Newport News and Avondale already has
received antitrust clearance from the Department of Justice.
Litton's offers, if accepted by the companies, would be subject to
the same kind of review.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Litton, a Fortune 500 company with 34,900 employees
nationwide, did not return messages for comment. But Michael R.
Brown, chairman and chief executive of Litton, issued a printed
statement late Thursday saying, ``When combined with our highly
efficient Ingalls Shipbuilding business, this triumvirate would
create a world-class leader in shipbuilding.''
</P>
<P>
   The company made its offers in a letter dated May 5.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of Newport News Shipbuilding would be a
tax-free, stock-for-stock merger in which each Newport News
Shipbuilding common share would be converted into 0.55 Litton
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Litton's deal for Avondale would be an all-cash transaction of
$38 per common share. The offers are above Thursday's closing
prices for both companies' shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our board is fully committed to acting in the best interest of
Newport News shareholders,'' said William P. Fricks, the company's
chairman and chief executive officer. Newport's board authorized
talks with Litton executives to evaluate the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Fricks said Newport's board has not determined whether the terms
Litton is proposing are adequate.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Paul Nisbet at JSA Research Inc. in Newport, R.I., said
that while Litton's bids were unexpected, they make sense. ``You'd
end up with two very powerful shipbuilders instead of one powerful
one and one weak, which you now have.''
</P>
<P>
   Litton is the weak one now, Nisbet said, but would gain a
competitive advantage over General Dynamics, the nation's other
major military shipbuilder, by pulling off these deals.
</P>
<P>
   A combined Litton-Avondale-Newport News could build nuclear
submarines, aircraft carriers and noncombatant support ships,
although General Dynamics still would have a lock on Navy
destroyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It evens the playing field. In fact, it tilts it a little in
Litton's favor over General Dynamics,'' Nisbet said.
</P>
<P>
   Newport News Shipbuilding designs and constructs nuclear-powered
aircraft carriers and submarines for the U.S. Navy and provides
life-cycle maintenance services for ships in the Navy fleet. The
company employs 18,000 people and has annual revenues of about $1.8
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Avondale is a major supplier of noncombat vessels to the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Litton's Ingalls Shipbuilding division makes guided missile
destroyers.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Litton reported sales of $1.13 billion and earnings
of $40.6 million for its most recent quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Litton's stock closed Thursday at $64.75, up 18.75 cents.

KANSAS REGULATORS APPROVE MERGER OF WESTERN RESOURCES, KCP&AMP;L 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The proposed merger of Western Resources Inc.
and Kansas City Power &AMP; Light Co. moved a step closer Thursday when
the utilities settled their differences with the staff of the
Kansas Corporation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement still must be approved by the commission, and by
Missouri and federal regulators. But the compromise is the first
big break in a logjam that has threatened to kill the merger.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for a four-year moratorium on rate increases
and an additional $45 million in rebates to be divided among the
Kansas customers of KCP&AMP;L and Western's KPL and KG&AMP;E electrical
utilities. The allocation among the utilities will be decided
later.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Western and KCP&AMP;L gave up on a plan that would have
allowed their merged utility to keep at least a share of any
profit. Instead, rates would be set in the traditional manner, by
basing them on a percentage above the utility's cost of providing
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sends a strong signal that in the state of Kansas this
merger is considered doable,'' said Michel' Philipp, a spokeswoman
for Western Resources.
</P>
<P>
   Glenda Safer, Kansas Corporation Commission general counsel,
said: ``They give up some pretty big things, and in return they get
some assurances.''
</P>
<P>
   But as details of the settlement emerged, some critics of the
merger said the two utilities got more than assurances. The critics
said they got the best of the deal, including keeping all cost
savings to themselves for the first four years of the merged
company's existence.
</P>
<P>
   The merger has picked up important political support in Kansas,
including that of Gov. Bill Graves, and some think the agreement
was hammered out, in part, because the Kansas Corporation
Commission staff didn't want to be blamed for torpedoing the
merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question they caved in,'' said Walker Hendrix, the
counsel for the Citizens' Utility Ratepayer Board in Topeka, which
represents consumers on utility issues.
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary Foreman, a spokeswoman for the commission, said that
there was no political pressure and that the staff thought the
agreement was good policy.
</P>
<P>
   The merger would create a company called Westar Energy, which
would absorb KCP&AMP;L and Western's KG&AMP;E and KPL utilities. It would
have 1 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, which is also supported by Topeka officials and
a local of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers,
comes as the commission completes its first week of hearings on the
merger.
</P>
<P>
   Those hearings will continue, with the agreement becoming part
of the proceedings. The agreement is expected to smooth the way for
Kansas regulators to approve the merger.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony filed a few weeks ago, the Kansas Corporation
Commission staff recommended that the combined company plow back
$24 million in annual rate relief to KG&AMP;E customers. The agreement
calls for rate rebates in 2001, 2002 and 2003 totaling $45 million.
</P>
<P>
   And the rate relief could be split among Kansas customers of
KPL, KG&AMP;E and KCP&AMP;L. The rebates would amount to only a few dollars
for residential customers, with the final allocation among the
utilities to be determined by the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Wichita, which is served by KG&AMP;E, has argued that because its
residential rates are much higher than for KPL and KCP&AMP;L customers,
KG&AMP;E customers should get the rate relief to make them more equal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed,'' said Mayor Bob Knight of Wichita.
</P>
<P>
   Rates would not increase in the first four years of the merged
company. But the merged company would be able to keep all cost
savings, which could amount to $300 million or more during the
moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   Safer, the general counsel of the Kansas Corporation Commission,
said those savings could end up benefiting consumers because any
rate hearing after the moratorium would account for the lower cost
of service.
</P>
<P>
   But Hendrix of the Citizens' Utility Ratepayer Board said the
merged company also would be able to recover other costs that make
further rate reduction more unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   In its previous testimony, the commission's staff said the
merged company could recover $230 million of the acquisition
premium _ the price paid for KCP&AMP;L over its book value _ from
Kansas consumers. The amount that it could recover has been
increased to $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the merged company would be able to recover
carrying charges on about $330 million in new plants that could be
collected after the rate moratorium. Those plants would also become
part of the cost of service in any rate hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Western and KCP&AMP;L ``carved a fat hog,'' Hendrix said.

SCIENTIST'S LAWYER MAKES A VIGOROUS DENIAL OF SPYING 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Far from being an atomic spy, Wen Ho Lee is a loyal
American who cooperated in the government's hunt for real spies,
his lawyer has told two newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Mark O. Holscher of Los Angeles, issued a six-page
statement in which he said Lee had never ``given any classified
information to any unauthorized persons.'' Lee was fired from his
job as a scientist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New
Mexico amid suspicions that he passed classified nuclear weapons
information to China.
</P>
<P>
   Holscher said his client ``will not be a scapegoat for alleged
security problems at our country's nuclear laboratories,'' and that
he and his wife, Sylvia, had repeatedly cooperated with federal
investigators on the trail of Chinese agents.
</P>
<P>
   Holscher has previously issued denials on his client's behalf,
and it has been reported that Lee may have had earlier contacts
with the FBI. But Thursday's denial and assertion of his client's
patriotism, to be reported in The Washington Post and The Los
Angeles Times on Friday, were by far the most detailed remarks
regarding his client.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer's statement said that Lee took ``substantial steps''
to guarantee the safety of computer programs he had downloaded.
``We are confident that no third party could have or did access his
protected computer files,'' the statement said, according to The
Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Holscher said Lee cooperated with the FBI on an undercover
mission to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory near San
Francisco in which a Taiwanese-born Livermore scientist was
investigated for possible espionage.
</P>
<P>
   The statement also said trips Lee made to China in 1986 and 1988
had been approved by officials at the FBI, Los Alamos and the
Energy Department.

LITTON BIDS TO BE TOP MILITARY SHIPBUILDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX AND BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Litton Industries Inc. has made unsolicited bids
totaling nearly $2 billion for two big shipbuilding companies,
officials said late Thursday, in deals that would turn the defense
contractor based in Woodland Hills in Los Angeles' San Fernando
Valley into the nation's preeminent military ship contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Litton made a $1.25 billion bid for Newport News Shipbuilding
Inc. of Newport News, Va., and a $503.9 million offer for Avondale
Industries Inc. of Avondale, La. Officials of both companies said
they would consider the offers.
</P>
<P>
   If the deals are accepted, the combined company would have
58,000 employees and annual revenue of $7.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The huge proposed deals, revealed early Thursday evening, are
surprising because Avondale had earlier agreed to be acquired by
Newport News.
</P>
<P>
   Litton's offer comes only about two weeks after the Defense
Department rejected General Dynamics Corp.'s $1.4 billion
unsolicited bid for Newport News Shipbuilding. Saying the potential
cost savings did not justify the deal, Pentagon officials feared
giving one company so much control over the nation's military ship
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of the Defense Department announcement April 14,
General Dynamics withdrew its offer.
</P>
<P>
   A proposed deal between Newport News and Avondale already has
received antitrust clearance from the Department of Justice.
Litton's offers, if accepted by the companies, would be subject to
the same kind of review.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Litton, a Fortune 500 company with 34,900 employees
nationwide, did not return messages for comment. But Michael R.
Brown, chairman and chief executive of Litton, issued a printed
statement late Thursday saying, ``When combined with our highly
efficient Ingalls Shipbuilding business, this triumvirate would
create a world-class leader in shipbuilding.''
</P>
<P>
   The company made its offers in a letter dated May 5.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of Newport News Shipbuilding would be a
tax-free, stock-for-stock merger in which each Newport News
Shipbuilding common share would be converted into 0.55 Litton
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Litton's deal for Avondale would be an all-cash transaction of
$38 per common share. The offers are above Thursday's closing
prices for both companies' shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our board is fully committed to acting in the best interest of
Newport News shareholders,'' said William P. Fricks, the company's
chairman and chief executive officer. Newport's board authorized
talks with Litton executives to evaluate the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Fricks said Newport's board has not determined whether the terms
Litton is proposing are adequate.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Paul Nisbet at JSA Research Inc. in Newport, R.I., said
that while Litton's bids were unexpected, they make sense. ``You'd
end up with two very powerful shipbuilders instead of one powerful
one and one weak, which you now have.''
</P>
<P>
   Litton is the weak one now, Nisbet said, but would gain a
competitive advantage over General Dynamics, the nation's other
major military shipbuilder, by pulling off these deals.
</P>
<P>
   A combined Litton-Avondale-Newport News could build nuclear
submarines, aircraft carriers and noncombatant support ships,
although General Dynamics still would have a lock on Navy
destroyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It evens the playing field. In fact, it tilts it a little in
Litton's favor over General Dynamics,'' Nisbet said.
</P>

aircraft carriers and submarines for the U.S. Navy and provides
life-cycle maintenance services for ships in the Navy fleet. The
company employs 18,000 people and has annual revenues of about $1.8

of $40.6 million for its most recent quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Litton's stock closed Thursday at $64.75, up 18.75 cents.

HEARTY WELCOME FOR SHIP'S CREW DEPLOYED SIX MONTHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ED OFFLEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BREMERTON, Wash. _ Streaked with corrosion and rust but with
sailors in immaculate white uniforms manning the rail, the aircraft
carrier USS Carl Vinson received a hero's welcome Thursday as it
returned home from a six-month deployment to the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier's 47,000-mile journey ended where it began exactly
six months ago as Navy tugs pushed the 95,000-ton warship into its
mooring spot at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton shortly
after 8:30 a.m. More than 5,000 family members and friends jammed
the narrow streets of the naval shipyard, transforming the
industrial facility into a sea of colored balloons and hand-painted
posters.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier reciprocated, serenading the crowd with classical
and pop music broadcast over its flight deck and releasing 5,000
colored balloons as it approached.
</P>
<P>
   The Carl Vinson served nearly half its time in the Persian Gulf
region, taking part in the final day of ``Operation Desert Fox,''
the four-day U.S.-British bombing campaign against Iraq in
mid-December, and conducting repeated air strikes against Iraqi
anti-aircraft units and other sites over the next three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very challenging and a very exciting time for us,''
said Rear Adm. Al Harms, who as commander of Carrier Group 3 led
the Vinson and eight escort ships to the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks into what had appeared to be a routine cruise to
the western Pacific and Indian Ocean, Harms received urgent orders
to abandon a scheduled visit to Australia and proceed directly to
the Persian Gulf. In fact, the admiral said, the nuclear-powered
carrier and two cruisers went ``ballistic'' for the last 2,000
miles, traveling non-stop at speeds in excess of 30 knots. The
ships sprinted through the Strait of Hormuz on Dec. 18, and
launched warplanes against Iraq the next night, he said. Two escort
ships fired Tomahawk cruise missiles at other Iraqi targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We proved the concept of `ready on arrival' by being fully
ready, flexible, mobile and self-sustainable,'' Harms said.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier left Bremerton with 300 vacancies, nearly 10 percent
of the crew roster. However, as the deployment continued,
replacement personnel steadily arrived and by the end of the cruise
the ship and its air wing were at full strength, the admiral said.
</P>
<P>
   He credited new naval communications systems with enabling his
staff to be prepared for complex air strikes on short notice. ``We
were fully integrated'' with the U.S. Central Command headquarters
and were able to receive detailed operational plans, satellite
images and other intelligence data as the Vinson sprinted toward
the combat zone, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The capability did not exist during the Persian Gulf War, when
the Navy could not talk directly to the other military services,
and daily targeting orders had to be photocopied and flown to the
carriers from Saudi Arabia, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Harms said he and Capt. David Crocker, the Vinson's commanding
officer, were especially proud of two facts: The carrier lost no
aircraft to hostile fire or accidents despite thousands of flights
conducted during the cruise, and there were no fatalities among the
combined ship and air wing crew of 5,000 personnel. Moreover, the
Carl Vinson was awarded the Battle E award recognizing it as the
outstanding carrier in the U.S Pacific Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Another recent high-technology innovation greatly helped crew
morale during the six-month separation from family members, Vinson
sailors said.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Internet and satellite telephone services, crew
members and their families were in nearly continuous contact via
e-mail and direct telephone services.
</P>
<P>
   Electrician's Mate 1st Class William LeVasseur III said he and
his wife, Susan, kept in daily contact throughout the deployment,
which meant much to him because she is pregnant with their second
child. Such a connection was unheard of when he joined the Navy 16
years ago, LeVasseur said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You used to have to write a letter, and it took two, three
weeks to get there,'' he recalled. ``And it took another two, three
weeks to get an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   For Aviation Ordnanceman Senior Chief Bill Sinyard, the
communications linking sailors and families kept crew morale
strong. ``This makes the work go by quicker and the days go by
easier,'' said Sinyard, a veteran of nine deployments.
</P>
<P>
   First off the ship upon arrival were about 50 sailors who had
become parents during the six months at sea. They were met by a
delegation of new mothers pushing strollers on the crowded pier.

GAY COUPLES IN L.A. REGISTER PARTNERSHIPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JESSE HIESTAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles City Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg and
her partner of 20 years filled out forms Thursday to become one of
the first couples to register as domestic partners.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg and Sharon Stricker were among dozens of same-sex
couples to seek purple-inked certificates on the first day the Los
Angeles County Registrar-Recorder offered domestic partner
registration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't confer any legal rights,'' Goldberg said. ``But we
do know that in the city of Los Angeles and the county of Los
Angeles, there are many employers who would be more than willing to
do domestic partner benefits if they didn't have to worry about,
Well, what exactly is a domestic partner?''
</P>
<P>
   County Assessor Kenneth Hahn said becoming an official domestic
partner means he and longtime companion Louis Mangual are no longer
``just two guys living down the street.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're loving and committed,'' said Hahn, who was second in
line to register. ``It gives me great pleasure that this celebrates
our 25th anniversary. I'm just extra delighted.''
</P>
<P>
   Over slices of ``Just Registered'' cake, the couples and gay and
lesbian activists said their ultimate goal _ civic marriage with
all its binding legal responsibilities _ will take years to get and
will be a tough fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about the homosexual agenda, it's about civil
rights,'' said Andy Ball, public policy manager of the L.A. Gay and
Lesbian Center, a sponsor of the celebration Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, activists count domestic partner registration as an
important first step.
</P>
<P>
   Hahn said he has been pressing for this option for two years.
Goldberg joined in last year and enlisted the help of county
Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky so it would apply countywide.
Supervisors approved it a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   The one-page form requires only that the two people give their
name, address, date of birth and a signature. Optional information
can be included such as the length of a relationship, whether the
couple jointly own property or if they share a household.
</P>
<P>
   Registration costs $20 plus $6 for a certified copy. The
registry is also open to heterosexual couples who choose not to
marry, according to county officials.
</P>
<P>
   Some couples said registering was uneventful, but for Rebecca
Luckett, 28, and Lisa Belsanti, 30, who have been a couple for the
past 2{ years, the wait in line was nerve-racking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got butterflies even though we knew we weren't getting
married,'' said Luckett, a college student.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems so sterile to come to a government office and fill
out paperwork, but it was exciting to sign it together,'' Belsanti
said. ``At least we know there's something that has a record of our
committed relationships to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whereas before it was just word of mouth,'' Luckett said
before they went for a ``honeymoon'' breakfast.

DODGERS HAPPY WITH TRIP, ESPECIALLY SINCE PEREZ IS OK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers hit well, pitched well and beat up on
the low budget bottom-feeders of the National League to finish a
nine-game road trip with seven wins. They went from despair to a
half-game out of first place.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it wasn't until after approximately 7 p.m. Thursday that
the road trip could actually be declared a success. That's when
left-hander pitcher Carlos Perez's right knee injury was diagnosed
as, for all intents and purpose, a bruise.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers officials said it was a soft tissue injury to his right
distal thigh (just above the kneecap). An MRI revealed no tears to
the muscles or tendons in the knee and Perez is listed as
day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm going to be ready for my next start,'' Perez said
by telephone. ``I'm walking better than (Wednesday) and I don't
have to use the (cane) the Dodgers gave me. I think I'm OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez, scheduled to start Tuesday against the Chicago Cubs,
spent five hours at Centinela Hospital Medical Center and was
examined by team physician Dr. Ralph Gambardella.
</P>
<P>
   How Perez injured his knee remains a mystery. Though he can't
pinpoint a moment when he felt a twinge, Perez said he injured it
while shagging fly balls before Tuesday's game on Montreal's
unforgiving Olympic Stadium turf.
</P>
<P>
   Perez denied that he injured his knee while out late the night
before he was scratched from his Wednesday start. General manager
Kevin Malone said he's heard stories that Perez injured his knee by
banging it on something during a night out in Montreal, where Perez
used to pitch, but said he believes Perez's story right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I talked to him (Wednesday night),'' Perez said about
meeting with Malone. ``I'm going to do it (today).''
</P>
<P>
   The Perez incident brought a curious and hectic end to a strong
Dodgers road trip. It began with the team flailing, looking
miserable after losing four of six at home _ low-lighted by St.
Louis' Fernando Tatis becoming the first player to hit two grand
slams in one inning.
</P>
<P>
   But a three-game sweep of the Milwaukee Brewers and series wins
against the Philadelphia Phillies and Montreal returned the aura of
a contender to the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven-and-two is a great trip,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson
said. ``We didn't play well on the last trip (going 2-5) so it was
good to play well on this one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers fell one win short of their first eight-win road
trip since 1997, but they had the winning formula down to near
perfection. And it always began with sensational starting pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Concluding with righty Jamie Arnold's 62/3 innings of one-hit
ball in Wednesday's finale, Dodgers starters went 7-2 with a 3.05
ERA. They pitched at least six innings in each start and allowed
more than three runs only twice.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Todd Hundley also showed signs of life hitting from the
left side, allowing Johnson to use the switch-hitter in the middle
of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley, batting fifth, hit .400 in the past five games with two
homers and seven RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd's keeping his head still,'' Dodgers batting coach Rick
Down said. ``By getting wider, staying still, he doesn't need to
move that front foot. His hands and his weight are coming through
together. He can hit it out to left-center. He's strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at that lineup, one through eight, there aren't
a lot of choices there now. It's a potent lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   An offense that scored 4.7 runs per game before the road trip
averaged 5.4 runs during the nine-game trip. It culminated with
left fielder Gary Sheffield's two homers and four RBI in
Wednesday's 8-2 win.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so strong and such a competitor and such a
perfectionist,'' Johnson said. ``He's so hard on himself, and it's
such a long road trip and he comes in early and works with the
weights and is in the trainer's room. He wants it.''

TOXIC PROBLEMS HALT CONSTRUCTION AT TWO L.A. AREA SCHOOLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREG GITTRICH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ State environmental inspectors halted construction
temporarily at two primary schools in the San Fernando Valley after
finding toxic soil problems at both sites, possibly delaying their
planned September openings.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental problems at Valerio Primary Care Center in Van
Nuys and Monroe Primary Care Center in Panorama City are the latest
in a series of site contamination problems that have plagued the
Los Angeles Unified School District. The most serious stalled
construction of the Belmont Learning Complex downtown and were
supposed to lead to tighter controls.
</P>
<P>
   If the primary centers in the Valley aren't completed on time,
540 children will be forced to double up at three elementary
schools in the area, according to Gordon Wohlers, assistant
superintendent in charge of policy, research and development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, in these very overcrowded areas, extra space
doesn't exist,'' Wohlers said after warning board members that the
deadlines must be met to avoid shuffling around the students.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said it is still possible Valerio and Monroe could be
ready for occupancy Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Soil samples from the Valerio site revealed that trace levels of
pesticides, probably from gardening in the past, cover the 3.4-acre
lot. In addition, the results of lead testing won't be completed
until Monday, said Erik Nasarenko, a spokesman for the district.
</P>
<P>
   If the tests do not find elevated levels of contaminants,
Nasarenko said, the district will remove the top six inches of soil
next week and test the ground underneath it to determine whether
toxins seeped below the surface level.
</P>
<P>
   Barring any deep contamination, another four- to five-foot layer
of dirt will be excavated and replaced with clean fill.
Construction should proceed at the end of this month, Nasarenko
said.
</P>
<P>
   Delays at the Monroe site arose after a ``miscommunication''
between the project contractor and the district, according to Hamid
Saebfar, chief of Southern California cleanup for the state
Department of Toxic Substances Control.
</P>
<P>
   The LAUSD Environmental Health and Safety Branch had performed
the required testing at the site and received approval from the
state, but failed to monitor the contractor's actions. Days after
the soil samples were taken, the contractor added tons of dirt to
the land from an outside source that had not been tested, Saebfar
said.
</P>
<P>
   Additional soil tests at Monroe were completed Thursday
afternoon and revealed that toxin levels at the site are not
dangerous. Construction is scheduled to resume Monday, Nasarenko
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the bungling has held up work for at least a week
and prompted board members to question why the Environmental Health
and Safety Branch failed to follow new rules that ensure all soil
is tested. The new procedures were put into place following the
problems at Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   Board member David Tokofsky said that with all the new schools
being built, the district should make sure the regulations in place
after Belmont are being followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should get these new rules down,'' Tokofsky said at
Thursday's committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Nasarenko said the mix-up at Monroe will cost the district ``a
few thousand dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Several recent leadership changes in the Environmental Health
and Safety Branch had nothing to do with the problem, Nasarenko
insisted. But, in the future, no grading or excavation can occur
without the permission of the branch's deputy director, Yi Hwa Kim,
he said.

NEW JERSEY DELIVERY SERVICE WITH EXPANSION PLANS ACQUIRES RIVAL
WESTWIND EXPRESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Westwind Express, a delivery service based in
Ventura County north of Los Angeles, with seven locations
nationwide, has been purchased by an East Coast rival.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidated Delivery &AMP; Logistics of Clifton, N.J., bought
Westwind for $5.5 million to expand its operations on the West
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to grow dramatically _ from Seattle to San Diego,''
said Drew Kronick, a vice president at Consolidated. ``Westwind has
an exceptional reputation in the marketplace and a history of very
strong profitability.''
</P>
<P>
   Westwind co-founder Steven Keihner said he and his father James
decided to sell. The Keihners had received other buyout offers but
chose Consolidated because the company gave them a better deal and
they liked the management. Consolidated also had an aura of
professionalism and sophistication not often seen in the courier
services industry, Keihner said.
</P>
<P>
   Four-year-old Consolidated had 1998 sales of $185.7 million,
growing mainly through acquisitions. Westwind, a 15-year-old firm
with $7 million in annual sales and 250 employees, is
Consolidated's 24th purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Westwind will not be laying off any people or closing its
offices in Van Nuys, Palmdale, Ontario, Fresno, Sacramento, Kansas
City and Lexena, Mo., as a result of the purchase. However,
Westwind will be renamed Consolidated.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Keihner will become Consolidated's West Coast regional
manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can grow with them,'' said the 38-year-old Keihner.
</P>
<P>
   On the West Coast, Consolidated has offices in Los Angeles,
Burlingame, Santa Rosa and Seattle. It employs 3,500.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Consolidated increased 18.75 cents to $3.3125, or 6
percent, on 20,100 shares traded, more than double the 20-day
average volume.

ANGELS LOSE THEIR PUNCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The Anaheim Angels began the 1999 season with
legitimate concerns about their pitching, but thinking their
offense would be fine.
</P>
<P>
   Funny how things turn out.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, though, was laughing in the Angels clubhouse after
Thursday's 4-2 loss to the Detroit Tigers before 12,510 at Tiger
Stadium. The Angels lost two of three to the Tigers and scored only
seven runs in the three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pitched great for three games,'' Angels manager Terry
Collins said. ``And believe me, I'm not taking anything away from
the Tigers pitching staff, but when you've got to shut a team out
to win, there's trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to pick the offense up. We come in and score seven
runs in the series. You're not going to win many games that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels wasted a solid performance by starter Chuck Finley
(1-3) _ 71/3 innings, four runs, 10 hits, eight strikeouts, one
walk. But they couldn't do much with Tigers starter Bryce Florie
(1-0) and five Tigers relievers.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers got just enough offense _ three hits and an RBI from
ex-Angel Damion Easley and a two-run homer by former Taft High star
Gabe Kapler (No. 2). The Angels' only runs scored on solo homers by
Todd Greene (No. 5 in the fifth inning) and Garret Anderson (No. 6
in the sixth).
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe every run we scored in this series was via home
run,'' Collins correctly noted. ``That tells you something.''
</P>
<P>
   What it tells Collins is that the Angels are failing to do the
little things to score runs. And with an offense that has in recent
days lost Tim Salmon (sprained left wrist) for three games and
Randy Velarde (stiff back) for one, every little bit counts.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Huson was a last-minute replacement for Velarde at second
base Thursday, and came up in key situations. In the third inning,
Huson came to the plate with the bases loaded and one out, but
ended the inning by grounding into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, he batted with runners on first and third with two
out and flied out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Huson was batting in Velarde's No. 2 spot in the lineup, and
Velarde is hitting .336. He said he's scheduled to have an MRI test
performed today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt this pain before during the week, but it gradually got
worse,'' he said. ``(Thursday) I tried to hit in the batting cage,
and even when I tried to jog it was real tight. Any time it's a
back, it's something to be concerned about.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins has plenty of concerns these days as he tries to field a
lineup that must stay in contention until Salmon, Velarde, Jim
Edmonds and Gary DiSarcina get back.
</P>
<P>
   They held their own with Mo Vaughn out of the lineup, but ``when
Mo was out we had several guys swinging the bat better than they
are now,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   It has made things a little frustrating for the starting
pitchers as well. In the three games with Detroit, Ken Hill, Steve
Sparks and Finley each pitched at least seven innings. They
combined for 221/3 innings and allowed six runs, but left town with
only one win among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a starting pitcher, you can't get wrapped up in that,''
said Finley, who hasn't won since his first start of the season
April 9. ``As a starter, you've got to go deep into the game, go
seven or eight innings and take your chances. The offense has their
thing and the pitchers have their thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley, though, showed frustration in the eighth inning when he
wanted a new baseball, and fired the old one in to catcher Charlie
O'Brien at about 90 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was probably just a little frustrated _ I usually don't do
stuff like that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Finley has pitched into the seventh inning or longer in each of
his past three starts but has nothing to show for it. And he says
it's tough to look at the bright side.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like going to the shrink and he tells you everything's
going to be all right,'' he said. ``But when you leave the office,
you don't feel any better.''

SLIP TO LOTTERY STATUS LEAVES FRANCHISE AT CROSSROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It is like being bounced from a first-class seat to
the worst in coach.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics these days are in the rear of the airplane, in a seat
that just does not recline.
</P>
<P>
   Uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling is undeniable throughout an organization that just
three years ago soared to the NBA Finals. The Sonics were on the
cusp of Western Conference supremacy. But in what seems like a snap
of the finger, they have failed to make the playoffs for the first
time in nine seasons, spiraling from contender to the NBA draft
lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it is as simple as looking at a situation and
saying `Well, that team failed and they can't get it done
anymore,''' first-year Sonics coach Paul Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   So how did it happen?
</P>
<P>
   As fast as it seems, the Sonics' undoing has been slow. It does
not rest solely on this 25-25, lockout-abbreviated season. In fact,
the team has not advanced past the second round of the playoffs
since the 1996 title run.
</P>
<P>
   Why? There are a number of factors:
</P>
<P>
   CURIOUSLY SHAKEN UP
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the team that pushed the Chicago Bulls to six
games in the 1996 NBA Finals was not given a second chance.
Starting center Ervin Johnson was allowed to sign elsewhere as a
free agent. The Sonics also did not bring back Vincent Askew and
Frank Brickowski, each of whom played key roles that season.
</P>
<P>
   That group of players brought toughness and meshed on the court.
</P>
<P>
   Although the team's core of players remained intact, the Sonics
returned the following season with a noticeably weaker roster.
</P>
<P>
   Team president Wally Walker signed free agent center Jim
McIlvaine, a move that still haunts the Sonics even though he was
traded before this season. McIlvaine's limited production often had
the Sonics playing four-on-five.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Larry Stewart and Craig Ehlo proved just as
futile. The Sonics' lack of toughness and rebounding compelled them
to sign veteran Terry Cummings midway through that 1996-97 season.
</P>
<P>
   FAILURE TO PLACATE KEMP
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, the Sonics found themselves reaching for more than
just playoff wins. The McIlvaine signing set off a ripple effect
that ultimately cost the team power forward Shawn Kemp. Kemp
loathed that the Sonics signed McIlvaine to a seven-year, $33
million deal in the summer of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics also rewarded All-Star point guard Gary Payton with
an $87 million contract in 1996. The soonest they could sweeten
Kemp's contract was October of 1998. The team said it planned to
reward Kemp, but he was unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
   Because Kemp eventually forced a trade, the Sonics virtually had
to start over.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp and Payton were supposed to be a new-and-improved John
Stockton and Karl Malone. As it turned out, the Kemp-Sonic divorce
allowed the Utah Jazz to stake claim on the West. Utah, with only
minor tinkering, has played in the last two NBA Finals and is
favored to reach a third.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics got All-Star Vin Baker in a three-team exchange for
Kemp, but they have been busy trying to doctor their chemistry ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   THE GEORGE KARL FACTOR
</P>
<P>
   While no one can dispute his coaching record , it could be
argued that former Sonics coach George Karl did not sustain the
growth of the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Karl did not entrust young players to provide significant
contributions. He relied solely on veterans and was unable to
develop rookies, which mortgaged the future of the team. The most
recent example is point guard Eric Snow, traded so Karl could play
veteran Greg Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   This team could have used Snow, who played his first two NBA
seasons with the Sonics. Instead, Snow became a starter with the
Philadelphia 76ers. His strong defense and ballhandling allowed
Allen Iverson to move to the shooting guard _ a switch the Sonics
would welcome for Payton.
</P>
<P>
   Karl was often stubborn. His personality clashed with a number
of players _ Askew, Johnson and Kendall Gill to name a few _ who
Karl ultimately ran out of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, the Sonics have begun each season with an average of
six new players.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Westphal replaced Karl as coach. The team also
welcomed eight new players and a new system that included the
development of rookies but minimal defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``In hindsight it's easy to say that those things had an adverse
affect,'' Walker said. ``But when you're in the situation at the
time, and in those two years (following 1996) we won 118 games, you
think a lot of things are going right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, when you fall short, you look back and say this or that
could have been better or different. For a variety of reasons we
weren't as good as we needed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   THE FUTURE
</P>
<P>
   Walker has reached a serious crossroad.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Payton and Detlef Schrempf, he is
responsible for another roster that did not cut it. His intention
was to make the team younger, bigger and more athletic. However,
the Sonics still appeared old, too small and too slow this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take the responsibility that we are where we are,'' Walker
told The Associated Press. ``We've just got to take our lumps and
not make excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics' goals in the offseason are clear-cut. A priority is
to re-sign Baker, who will opt to become a free agent, and add a
tough, defensive-minded center. If the Sonics cannot find an
explosive guard who can create his own shot, they will try to land
a quality point guard and move Payton to the shooting guard.
</P>
<P>
   But first they hope to get a solid player from the draft
lottery.
</P>
<P>
   In other words: Next season will be more of the same. Starting
over without any promises.
</P>
<P>
   Fasten your seatbelt.

HEARTY WELCOME FOR SHIP'S CREW DEPLOYED SIX MONTHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ED OFFLEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BREMERTON, Wash. _ Streaked with corrosion and rust but with
sailors in immaculate white uniforms manning the rail, the aircraft
carrier USS Carl Vinson received a hero's welcome Thursday as it
returned home from a six-month deployment to the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier's 47,000-mile journey ended where it began exactly
six months ago as Navy tugs pushed the 95,000-ton warship into its
mooring spot at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton shortly
after 8:30 a.m. More than 5,000 family members and friends jammed
the narrow streets of the naval shipyard, transforming the
industrial facility into a sea of colored balloons and hand-painted
posters.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier reciprocated, serenading the crowd with classical
and pop music broadcast over its flight deck and releasing 5,000
colored balloons as it approached.
</P>
<P>
   The Carl Vinson served nearly half its time in the Persian Gulf
region, taking part in the final day of ``Operation Desert Fox,''
the four-day U.S.-British bombing campaign against Iraq in
mid-December, and conducting repeated air strikes against Iraqi
anti-aircraft units and other sites over the next three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very challenging and a very exciting time for us,''
said Rear Adm. Al Harms, who as commander of Carrier Group 3 led
the Vinson and eight escort ships to the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks into what had appeared to be a routine cruise to
the western Pacific and Indian Ocean, Harms received urgent orders
to abandon a scheduled visit to Australia and proceed directly to
the Persian Gulf. In fact, the admiral said, the nuclear-powered
carrier and two cruisers went ``ballistic'' for the last 2,000
miles, traveling non-stop at speeds in excess of 30 knots. The
ships sprinted through the Strait of Hormuz on Dec. 18, and
launched warplanes against Iraq the next night, he said. Two escort
ships fired Tomahawk cruise missiles at other Iraqi targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We proved the concept of `ready on arrival' by being fully
ready, flexible, mobile and self-sustainable,'' Harms said.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier left Bremerton with 300 vacancies, nearly 10 percent
of the crew roster. However, as the deployment continued,
replacement personnel steadily arrived and by the end of the cruise
the ship and its air wing were at full strength, the admiral said.
</P>
<P>
   He credited new naval communications systems with enabling his
staff to be prepared for complex air strikes on short notice. ``We
were fully integrated'' with the U.S. Central Command headquarters
and were able to receive detailed operational plans, satellite
images and other intelligence data as the Vinson sprinted toward
the combat zone, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The capability did not exist during the Persian Gulf War, when
the Navy could not talk directly to the other military services,
and daily targeting orders had to be photocopied and flown to the
carriers from Saudi Arabia, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Harms said he and Capt. David Crocker, the Vinson's commanding
officer, were especially proud of two facts: The carrier lost no
aircraft to hostile fire or accidents despite thousands of flights
conducted during the cruise, and there were no fatalities among the
combined ship and air wing crew of 5,000 personnel. Moreover, the
Carl Vinson was awarded the Battle E award recognizing it as the
outstanding carrier in the U.S Pacific Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Another recent high-technology innovation greatly helped crew
morale during the six-month separation from family members, Vinson
sailors said.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Internet and satellite telephone services, crew
members and their families were in nearly continuous contact via
e-mail and direct telephone services.
</P>
<P>
   Electrician's Mate 1st Class William LeVasseur III said he and
his wife, Susan, kept in daily contact throughout the deployment,
which meant much to him because she is pregnant with their second
child. Such a connection was unheard of when he joined the Navy 16
years ago, LeVasseur said.

   ``You used to have to write a letter, and it took two, three
weeks to get there,'' he recalled. ``And it took another two, three

<P>
   For Aviation Ordnanceman Senior Chief Bill Sinyard, the
communications linking sailors and families kept crew morale
strong. ``This makes the work go by quicker and the days go by
easier,'' said Sinyard, a veteran of nine deployments.
</P>
<P>
   First off the ship upon arrival were about 50 sailors who had
become parents during the six months at sea. They were met by a
delegation of new mothers pushing strollers on the crowded pier.

BOEING INVESTIGATORS CONFIDENT THEY'LL FIND ROCKET ENGINE'S
MALFUNCTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The second-stage engine on The Boeing Co.'s new Delta
3 rocket fired for only one second of a burn that was supposed to
last nearly three minutes, which left a $230 million Asian
communications satellite stranded in a useless orbit, investigators
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But they are confident the cause of the engine malfunction can
be found and fixed in time to possibly fly Delta 3 before the end
of the year _ this time successfully.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the record for Boeing's important Delta 3 program is
0-2. The first rocket exploded on its maiden flight last August.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators do not know why the engine abruptly shut down
without being commanded to do so after what looked to be a
successful launch Tuesday night from Cape Canaveral, Fla. But they
said the rocket sent back a wealth of good telemetry data to ground
tracking stations that can be analyzed to help find the cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investigative team now has a good focus with regard to
what we want to do,'' Russell Reck, Boeing's director of
engineering technology for its launch systems, told reporters
Thursday during a teleconference. He is leading the investigative
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are headed in the right direction,'' he added. ``I'm very
optimistic ... we will have some resolution to this problem in a
reasonable length of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the latest problem, Delta 3 was next scheduled to loft an
ICO communications satellite into orbit during the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Witzling, Boeing's vice president of Delta 2 and Delta 3
programs, said during the teleconference he believes Delta 3 will
fly again before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to fly successfully,'' he said. ``We are
committed to making Delta 3 work.''
</P>
<P>
   While the investigators focus on the rocket, engineers for
Hughes, which built the Orion 3 satellite for Loral, are trying to
put the spacecraft into a low-Earth parking orbit to give them more
time to study options for possibly salvaging the mission.
</P>
<P>
   Those options include an astronaut rescue mission using the
space shuttle, sending the misplaced satellite around the moon and
back to ease it into the correct orbit, or using the craft's
on-board engine to push it into the proper orbit.
</P>
<P>
   None of those options at this point look particularly promising,
said Hughes spokesman Don O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Even if NASA agreed, a shuttle rescue mission probably could not
be launched in time, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't leave it there for four or five years waiting for a
mission from NASA,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes has in the past sent a misplaced satellite around the
moon to slingshot it into the proper Earth orbit after it was left
in a useless orbit by a Russian rocket that failed.
</P>
<P>
   Had the launch gone as planned, after the satellite separated
from Delta 3 its small on-board engine would have been sufficient
to kick it into a circular orbit 22,300 miles above the equator.
</P>
<P>
   To buy some time, Hughes engineers Thursday were in the process
of moving the satellite into a nearly circular orbit of 1,100
kilometers at its low point to 1,300 kilometers at the high point.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite can remain in that orbit for as long as three
years before it re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and burns up. But
after a year or so the electronic systems would be damaged by the
radiation belts that circle the Earth, O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes is part of the Boeing-led investigative team, as is
Loral, the Air Force, Lockheed Martin and Pratt &AMP; Whitney, the
maker of the second-stage engine for Delta 3.
</P>
<P>
   The second stage on Delta 3 is similar to the upper stage on an
Air Force Titan 4B rocket that did not work properly last Friday
after its launch from Cape Canaveral. Investigators said the
Titan's upper stage misfired and placed an $800 million military
communications satellite into a useless orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin is part of the Delta 3 investigative board
because it makes the Titan.
</P>
<P>
   The RLB10-2 second stage engine on Delta 3 was supposed to fire
twice following separation from the first stage.
</P>
<P>
   The first 10-minute burn was successful and the telemetry data
shows nothing unusual occurred, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   After about 10 minutes, the engine was supposed to fire again,
this time for nearly three minutes. Instead, it suddenly shut down
after only a second.

TWO CRUISE LINES WILL BASE VESSELS IN SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ARTHUR C. GORLICK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For years, the Port of Seattle and the region's
business leaders battled futilely to get a cruise ship line to
operate from the city's waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two cruise ship lines say they will base vessels here.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean International announced Thursday that next year
it will become the second cruise ship line to operate at the Port
of Seattle's Bell Street Pier facilities at Pier 66.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami-based cruise line said it will base its
2,000-passenger Vision of the Seas in Seattle for voyages through
Puget Sound, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, the San Juan Islands and
Canada's Inside Passage to Vancouver and Victoria, B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian Cruise Line announced last year that it will operate
21 seven-day summer cruises to Alaska aboard its 2,000-passenger
Norwegian Sky from Seattle's Bell Street Pier terminal beginning
May 7, 2000, under a four-year agreement with the port.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that cruising is an ideal way to really experience
this part of the country, which boasts spectacular scenery and
wonderful ports of call,'' said Jack Williams, president of Royal
Caribbean International.
</P>
<P>
   Port of Seattle officials said that each vessel call will pump
nearly $1 million into the community. The two cruise lines are
expected to create 400 new jobs, produce $74 million in business
revenues and generate $8.4 million in state and local taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Besides longshore and stevedore jobs, the cruise ships directly
create jobs for ticketing and reservations agents and business for
provisioners of bunker fuel, food and a range of items and services
that include flowers and piano tuners.
</P>
<P>
   Port of Seattle commissioners have authorized construction of a
$12.9 million cruise terminal at the Bell Street Pier facility,
which contained only a shell for a cruise terminal when the $110
million, 11-acre pier opened in July 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Royal Caribbean is using the seven cruises next year as a test
of the itineraries in the new market,'' said port spokesman Imbert
Matthee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this works out well, we assume they will go for a longer
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean will launch its Port of Seattle operations with
a one-night cruise for travel agents on May 14, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   On May 15, 22 and 29, 2000, it will have four-night cruises into
British Columbia. On May 19 and 26, it will have three-night
cruises and on June 2, 2000, a two-night cruise.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian Cruise Line's lease gives it exclusive use of the
port's cruise ship terminal on Sundays, a preferred day for
departure.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean will operate its Vision of the Seas voyages on
Mondays and Fridays, Matthee said.
</P>
<P>
   Large vessel cruising from the Port of Seattle had been stymied
for years by the 1886 Passenger Service Act, which bars
foreign-registered cruise ships from stopping at more than one U.S.
port per voyage to pick up or drop off passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the law's restrictions, cruise lines have operated
extensively from Vancouver, B.C., with many cruise ship passengers
arriving at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and being bused to
Vancouver. Vancouver's harbor has become increasingly crowded with
cruise ships.
</P>
<P>
   The Port of Seattle and Greater Seattle Chamber of Commerce
unsuccessfully backed efforts to get Congress to change the law,
but the two cruise lines that will operate here have found ways
around the limitations.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Caribbean cruises will stop at two Canadian ports
before completing a round-trip voyage to Seattle, complying with
the 113-year-old law.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegian Cruise Line voyages will stop at Alaskan ports,
but won't drop off passengers before heading back to Seattle with a
stop in Vancouver, B.C., also under the law's provisions.

PRESCOTT VALLEY TEENS CHARGED IN SCHOOL SHOOTING PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRESCOTT VALLEY, Ariz. _ Two teenagers were charged Thursday in
what police say was a meticulous plan for shooting classmates and
teachers, and 400 parents demanded to know why they weren't warned
about the threats.
</P>
<P>
   The unidentified teens, 13- and 14-year-old students at Liberty
Traditional School, were picked up Wednesday and charged Thursday
with misdemeanor counts of disorderly conduct and threatening and
intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities originally had considered charging them with
conspiracy to commit murder and solicitation to commit murder.
</P>
<P>
   Yavapai County Sheriff's spokeswoman Sharron Wachter said the
14-year-old confirmed a plot that the 13-year-old had described to
authorities on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-year-old sketched a diagram, showing how the two planned
to position themselves on rooftops at the kindergarten through
eighth-grade school, what weapons they would use, what walkways
they would target and their escape routes, Wachter said.
</P>
<P>
   The pair also targeted specific students and teachers, she said,
and both teens expressed interest in ``Nazi philosophies.''
</P>
<P>
   No weapons were found and there was no evidence of Internet
usage in either boy's home, she said. No more arrests are expected.
</P>
<P>
   But coming weeks after the massacre at Columbine High in
Littleton, Colo., the arrests sent shock waves through this booming
bedroom community in the rolling hills east of Prescott.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies were called Wednesday by two teachers concerned that
Principal Carol Lyons had taken no action on the threats. They told
deputies that the teenagers had been making threatening statements
about shooting teachers and students since January.
</P>
<P>
   But Humboldt Unified School District Superintendent Gary Spikes
disputed that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a couple of comments a couple of weeks ago,'' he
told emotional parents in the school gym Thursday night. ``The
statement was made, `If I was to do that, I'd take the teachers out
first.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He said the two teens have been suspended indefinitely and Lyons
has been placed on paid administrative leave.
</P>
<P>
   The parents criticized administrators for not notifying them
Thursday morning, even though the teens were picked up Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teachers told my kids that they weren't supposed ot talk
about it,'' said Debbie Griffin, a mother of two Liberty students.
``You're playing Russian roulette with the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Denise St. Clar, who teaches second grade at Liberty, said the
incident had been ``blown totally out of proportion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was like any other day here,'' she said. ``I took my
class on a field trip, nobody was worried and we were assured that
everything was safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Wasem's jaw dropped when told of the arrests. She was
preparing to enroll her 5-year-old daughter at Liberty next fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goodness, I have another child at Bradshaw Mountain High
School, and they just had two evacuations there because of
threats,'' Wasem said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought this traditional school would be the safest
alternative of all. I guess this is happening everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The 5-year-old Liberty school is a public school of about 350
students. It emphasizes traditional teaching methods, and every
parent is expected to take part in school activities.
</P>
<P>
   In a note Thursday afternoon to parents of Liberty students,
school administrators said, ``There are no serious issues of
student safety.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rita Frye, co-owner of Self Defense Academy, a Prescott
Valley martial-arts school, said all the recent threats of violence
in the local schools had been doing wonders for business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've grown quickly, from 40 to 80 students,'' Frye said.
``Parents say they are very concerned about all of these things,
even here in a little town like this.'' &QL;

NEW JERSEY DELIVERY SERVICE WITH EXPANSION PLANS ACQUIRES RIVAL
WESTWIND EXPRESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Westwind Express, a delivery service based in
Ventura County north of Los Angeles, with seven locations
nationwide, has been purchased by an East Coast rival.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidated Delivery &AMP; Logistics of Clifton, N.J., bought
Westwind for $5.5 million to expand its operations on the West
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to grow dramatically _ from Seattle to San Diego,''
said Drew Kronick, a vice president at Consolidated. ``Westwind has
an exceptional reputation in the marketplace and a history of very
strong profitability.''
</P>
<P>
   Westwind co-founder Steven Keihner said he and his father James
decided to sell. The Keihners had received other buyout offers but
chose Consolidated because the company gave them a better deal and
they liked the management. Consolidated also had an aura of
professionalism and sophistication not often seen in the courier
services industry, Keihner said.
</P>
<P>
   Four-year-old Consolidated had 1998 sales of $185.7 million,
growing mainly through acquisitions. Westwind, a 15-year-old firm
with $7 million in annual sales and 250 employees, is
Consolidated's 24th purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Westwind will not be laying off any people or closing its
offices in Van Nuys, Palmdale, Ontario, Fresno, Sacramento, Kansas
City and Lexena, Mo., as a result of the purchase. However,
Westwind will be renamed Consolidated.
</P>
<P>

BYU BEATS PENN STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Brigham Young's two first-team All-Americans, who
were feared to be ill with an ``intense intestinal distress'' on
the eve of the NCAA Men's Volleyball Championship, recovered nicely
for the semifinal Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Ossie Antonetti had 24 kills and 14 digs and Ryan Millar had 20
kills and four blocks for the top-seeded Cougars.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars felt right at home with a boisterous fan base
cheering them on as the eliminated Penn State, 10-15, 15-15, 15-11,
15-5, in opening semifinal match in front of at UCLA's Pauley
Pavilion Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up this morning and felt better,'' Millar said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a perfect match, but BYU coach Carl McGown will take
it. This is the Cougars first appearance in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first game, Penn State's serving and receiving was
exceptional well,'' McGown said. ``As the match progressed I don't
think we ever were good in the match, but our receiving got better.
I hope that we can play better than that Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   BYU (29-1) will play the winner of the Long Beach State-Indiana
Purdue Fort Wayne semifinal, played late Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The closer the Cougars (29-1) came within winning the match,
their fans starting chanting ``bring on the beach.'' Their only
loss came at the hand of the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   The Nittany Lions opened the match, hitting .353 to take the
lead, but they faltered offensively in the second game. They had 13
attack errors and hit .083, while the Cougars easily tied the
match, 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Ossie Antonetti, who had eight kills but five errors in the
opener, was errorless in Game 2 with six kills. The Cougars also
put up a ferocious block, with five team blocks compared to one by
the Nittany Lions.
</P>
<P>
   With the momentum on their side, the Cougars went ahead 7-3 and
8-4 in the third game, but their lead didn't last long. PSU
rallied, scoring five unanswered point to take their first lead in
the game on a kill by Tony Mazzullo.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cougars regained the lead, 10-9, on a kill by Rich
Lambourne (10 kills, eight digs) and never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   BYU ran away from the Nittany Lions in Game 4, opening with a
7-1 advantage, and never relenting. On match point, Millar made a
spectacular save, when he dug the ball with his foot to keep it in
play. The Nittany Lions were out of position and setter Jose
Quiones hit into the net to end the match.
</P>
<P>
   BYU, which leads the country in hitting percentage, hit .344.
</P>
<P>
   ``We showed flashes of being able to play with anyone and then
flashes of being a junior high school girls team, not being able to
hit the ball on the court,'' Penn State coach Mark Pavlik.''
</P>
<P>
   Brad Miller had 20 kills, and Mazzullo had 15 kills, but also 15
errors. The Nittany Lions hit .204. They finished their season,
22-13.

   BOSTON _ Dominik who?
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins said all the right things going into
Thursday &UR;  &LR; night's opener against the Sabres. They said they
respected Dominik Hasek's ability, his Hart and Vezina trophies,
and his Olympic gold medal. They also talked about ways to beat the
Buffalo goalie. They talked about shooting and shooting and then
shooting some more.
</P>
<P>
   But didn't you wonder, just a little bit? Didn't you fret the
Bruins were going to be just a little intimidated going against the
unorthodox Dominator after his sweep of the Ottawa Senators in
Round 1 and considering the Bruins went 1-4 in the regular season
against Buffalo?
</P>
<P>
   Be honest. You wondered just a little, didn't you?
</P>
<P>
   Well, wonder no more.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins showed there is no respect like self-respect as they
defeated the Sabres, 4-2, in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference
semifinals at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth straight playoff win for Boston, which got
solid netminding from its own Vezina finalist, Byron Dafoe (28
saves).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to stay focused when you come off winning a first
round like that,'' said coach Pat Burns, who had cautioned his team
about being too high coming off the series win over the Hurricanes.
``It's very important that everybody relaxes, even after tonight,
and have our two feet firmly planted on the ground and that the
helmets will fit tomorrow. It's only one step and many steps to go.
They got the message, and I think they handled themselves well.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been pointed out many times that one of the keys to the
Bruins' attack is contribution from the top line, which was only
so-so against Carolina. Center Jason Allison, who had six assists
in six games against the Hurricanes but no goals, was a force
Thursday &UR;  &LR; night. He had four shots in the opening 20 minutes and
was buzzing all around the Buffalo zone. He potted his first goal
of the playoffs at 13:59 with Boston on the power play, increasing
his point streak to seven games. Allison took a pass from Darren
Van Impe and skated through the right circle toward Hasek.
Defenseman Richard Smehlik tried to lay the lumber on Allison, but
Allison had built up a head of steam and kept on going. He fired a
shot that went off Hasek's left shoulder and popped over the
netminder and into the cage for a 1-0 lead, providing a giant lift.
</P>
<P>
   Dmitri Khristich dinged his right shoulder when he checked
Sabres defenseman Rhett Warrener at 18:27 of the first but he shook
it off and not only came back to play but scored his first two
goals of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   At 15:21 of the second, Allison skated around the net and
centered a pass for Kyle McLaren. McLaren fanned on the shot and
the puck found its way to Khristich, who was parked at the left
post. He batted it out of the air, giving Boston a 2-0 lead. It
extended Khristich's point streak to four games.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres battled back at 18:19, tallying a power-play goal
during a four-on-three advantage. Jason Woolley set up defense
partner Alexei Zhitnik for a one-timer from the right circle and it
eluded Dafoe's glove to pull Buffalo to 2-1. It ended Dafoe's
scoreless streak at 134 minutes 49 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins regained their two-goal advantage in the final
seconds of the period when Joe Thornton potted his second goal of
the playoffs. With the Bruins on the power play, Van Impe dished a
pass to Ray Bourque, who fired a shot from the point that went off
Thornton and past Hasek with 13.3 seconds remaining. The goal
increased Thornton's point streak to five games, with two goals and
four assists in that span.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres made it interesting at 9:37 of the third when they
converted a Boston turnover into an unassisted Woolley goal to pull
within 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   But they could get no closer, and Khristich closed out the
scoring with an empty-netter at 19:48.
</P>
<P>
   At least for a night, Hasek proved mortal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goals we scored, there's nothing Dominik could do,'' said
Burns. ``Khristich's (first) goal, I don't care who you are, you're
not going to stop that. Same with Joe Thornton's goal. Who's going
to stop those, whether your name is Dominik Hasek or whatever your
name is? That's nothing to do with him being on top of his game.
He's still on top of his game, we just found a way, that's all.''

IT TOOK NO TIME FOR HASEK TO BECOME SORE SUBJECT 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ One game into the series, the Bruins are already tired
of answering questions about the other team's goalie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he let some goals in this year,'' sniffed coach Pat
Burns. ``His goals-against average was not 0.00.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of silly,'' declared Jason Allison, who had a vital
first goal and a superb assist. ``We won, 4-2, we played great, and
all anyone wants to talk about is that Dominik Hasek got beat.''
</P>
<P>
   We are guilty as charged. Journalists are always searching for
The Hook, and in this Eastern Conference semifinal confrontation
The Hook is The Goalkeeper. And why not? Here is a twice, and,
perhaps, future MVP and Olympic hero for the ages who has just come
off a playoff series where he carried his team to victory. Not for
nothing is he called The Dominator.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday &UR;  &LR; night he was, if not Mr. Ordinary, at least Mr.
Beatable. Well, kinda. He had no chance on goals two and three.
Four was a Dmitri Khristich empty-netter. He wasn't horrible. He
just got beat.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry. I'd better not let the coach hear me say that. He didn't
get beat. They got beat. If I'm not careful, Pat Burns will wash my
mouth out with lye.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not the only part of their game,'' reminded Burns. ``We
have other things to worry about in these games other than Dominik
Hasek.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, OK, sure. That makes sense. But let's not have these
people attempt to tell us that it didn't give them a huge lift when
they got on the scoreboard first against the Buffalo Sabres and
their Dominator, courtesy of an Allison goal that had the phrase
``big-time'' written all over it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they had that many good chances,'' said Hasek.
``I don't want to say they had lucky goals. But they did get the
first goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes, the first goal. One thing everyone on both sides could
agree on: the first goal in this game was hugely huge and even
humungous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first goal in a game between teams that can play defense
like these two,'' observed the ballyhooed Michael Peca, ``gives you
a big advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Bearing down on the right side, Allison fought off some
pressure, held his shot, waited for the great man to make a move
and then beat him over the left shoulder at 13:59 of the first
period. You don't score that goal unless you really know what
you're doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be able to carry it in like that was a natural goal
scorer's move,'' lauded Steve Heinze, himself an invaluable guy of
late. ``He did what he did, knowing he was going to get whacked and
hacked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I brought it in,'' explained Allison. ``He goes down a lot. I
saw him go down and I tried to get it over him.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison initiated the action on the second Boston goal as well.
This time he came swooping down the left side, went behind the
cage, and then whipped a pass to Kyle McLaren, who got it to an
uncovered Khristich on Hasek's right. Khristich tapped it in. Hasek
was powerless to stop him.
</P>
<P>
   Goal No. 3 was scored by Joe Thornton, who somehow managed to
get a stick on a Ray Bourque blast from the point. How the puck got
by Hasek might forever remain a mystery. But it most certainly
counted.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Khristich goal there was nothing Dominik could do,''
maintained Burns. ``The Joe Thornton goal? Who's gonna stop that?
It doesn't matter if your name is Dominik Hasek.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Burns is knocking Hasek. I don't doubt he has
great respect for the man. But the Boston mentor has got to
convince his team that Hasek is a man, and not a legend. He has to
fill them with confidence. That's part A. Part B is that he's got a
damn good goaltender himself, and he'd like the world to know about
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't hear as much about our guy because his name is Byron
Dafoe and not Dominik Hasek,'' said Burns. ``But Byron is gaining
stature in the National Hockey League. And I said this morning that
there is more pressure in this series on Dominik Hasek than there
is on Byron Dafoe. It's like being a 50-goal scorer. People expect
a certain production from you once you've done it. But he's only
human. He lets goals in. So I'm not surprised we scored a few.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always pressure on the goalie,'' countered Hasek,
``especially in the playoffs. One goal can be the difference in the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a whole lot more to this Boston victory than just the
idea that the red light was actually lit three times behind Dominik
Hasek. Ray Bourque was positively ubiquitous, dishing out hit after
hit, breaking up plays, and initiating offense. Thirty-eight? Not
possible. Allison was simply sensational. Dafoe did what he had to
do. And although you won't see Heinze's name on the scoresheet, be
it known he had another strong game which included drawing two
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``You noticed, huh?'' he smiled. ``I didn't think you guys
noticed things like that. It was just hard work. You want to help
the team any way you can.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, they all figured they'd know what to expect when they
picked up the paper or flipped on the TV this morning. ``Oh,
sure,'' said Allison. ``All the hype has been about Dominik. He's a
great goalie, but he's human. If some people are going to say that
the story tonight is that we beat him, that's fine. I've been
reading for three days now how one man's going to win the Stanley
Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong with saying that, as long as you realize
it is very early in the series. The Bruins would do well to listen
to their newly-bearded leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you beat him,'' said Bourque, ``you count your blessings,
and you move on to the next game.''

RED SOX MAY HAVE SUFFERED LOSS IN WIN 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-RANGERS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Bret Saberhagen always knew the road back wouldn't be
easy. Even in victory, the Red Sox starter wasn't surprised to
learn he would endure yet another round of pain and suffering.
</P>
<P>
   But this time there will be no rush to judgment or treatments
designed to expedite the healing process. No matter what the
doctors say, Saberhagen will have an MRI Friday and then accept a
spot on the disabled list to rehabilitate the muscle strain in his
right shoulder that won't go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm frustrated,'' Saberhagen said after lasting only three
innings in a 3-2 victory at Fenway Park that gave the Sox a split
of a two-game series with the Texas Rangers. ``I do stuff to get
this strong and get to this point. What can you say? The team has
been struggling. I feel like I can help the team, but I can't help
the team when I'm feeling this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Saberhagen's injury, the Sox would have had a lot to
celebrate. On the eve of Mo Vaughn's return, Boston won with sharp
hitting. Jose Offerman went 3 for 5. John Valentin, Damon Buford,
and Trot Nixon had big hits.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 21,412 went home happy after seeing relievers Derek
Lowe, Rheal Cormier, and Tim Wakefield perform beautifully after
replacing Saberhagen at the start of the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   But all of that seemed to fade into the background afterward,
when it was obvious that Saberhagen's condition had taken center
stage.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox are expected to make a move Friday to fill Saberhagen's
spot. The details are sketchy, but one thing is certain, according
to Sox general manager Dan Duquette: ``There is no pitching,'' he
said. ``Anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this may have come to fruition had Saberhagen not
injured himself April 24 while facing Cleveland. Thursday &UR;  &LR; night,
after throwing 43 pitches, Saberhagen returned to the mound to warm
up and felt something familiar. The stiffness he had experienced
before returned. It felt like a knot, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no warning,'' said Sox manager Jimy Williams when asked
to explain how Saberhagen could reinjure himself without anyone
knowing something was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hear any statements from anyone that there was any
problem,'' he said. ``I was still in the dugout when I looked out
and saw Bret standing on the mound, looking our way. I knew that
was not good.''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good throwing on the side in between starts,'' said
Saberhagen. ``I felt good Friday and Monday. I've been getting up
and down. I don't know if it (the shoulder) is fatigued or just
stiffens up somehow and causes a knot that affects the shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen's replacements, Lowe and Cormier, did their part in
keeping the Texans in tow while the Boston lead grew to 2-0, 2-1,
and 3-1. In the ninth inning, the Sox called upon a rare trump card
when Wakefield relieved Cormier with one out, a runner on second
and Boston clinging to a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield retired the only two batters he faced _ picking up his
first career save _ by getting Lee Stevens to ground to third and
pinch hitter Luis Alicea to fly to right.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield hasn't fared particularly well as a starter this year,
but he did just fine as the Sox' closer in a pinch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always told me he would put on the spikes if we needed
him,'' said Williams. ``Nobody even knew he was out there for a
while. But we're trying to win ballgames. Even though he has to
pitch in two days, we'll use every sound arm we can get.''

A BIG RELIEF FOR WAKEFIELD 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-WAKEFIELD-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He's often joked about starting 30 games and relieving
30 games, and if you don't think Tim Wakefield can do it, well,
don't be so sure.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Wakefield played the role of Tom Gordon,
pitching two-thirds of an inning to earn his first career save in a
3-2 Red Sox victory over the Texas Rangers at Fenway Park.
Wakefield is still scheduled to start Saturday night against
Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a night the Red Sox look back upon as a turning point,
despite Bret Saberhagen having to leave the game after three strong
innings because of shoulder stiffness that will place him in an MRI
machine Friday morning and on the disabled list. The bullpen, which
had been catastrophic of late, seemed to end its slide with strong
performances by Derek Lowe (2 1/3 innings, one run), Rheal Cormier
(3 innings, one run), and finally Wakefield.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield had informed manager Jimy Williams, as he has in the
past, that he would be available to come out of the bullpen if
needed.
</P>
<P>
   When Saberhagen couldn't start the fourth, Wakefield ran out to
the bullpen to get himself ready if needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart's still beating a thousand miles an hour,'' said
Wakefield. ``It's a great feeling to be standing out there at the
end shaking everyone's hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield has been in a slump as a starter, allowing 18 earned
runs and 26 hits in his last 15 innings. He is a knuckleballer and
his streaks start one way and go the other when he's boosted by a
performance. This might have been it.
</P>
<P>
   Bullpen coach John Cumberland, who watched Wakefield throw
before the game, also monitored him during the eighth and ninth
innings and came away feeling he had a good knuckleball working.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has got to be a confidence boost for him,'' said
Cumberland. ``It's a huge lift for Tim and it's a huge lift for the
team. We've been slumping lately, but you can't say enough about
this performance and the job the guys did ahead of him tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield recalls saves in the minors, when he was in the
Pittsburgh Pirates system. He recalls playing one game at second
base and then coming on to pitch the final three innings for the
save.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday &UR;  &LR; night, the Red Sox held a 3-1 lead heading into the
ninth. Williams elected to stay with Cormier, who was pitching with
great confidence. Cormier induced Rafael Palmeiro to line softly to
Nomar Garciaparra, but Ivan Rodriguez rocketed a single off the
wall before Todd Zeile doubled him in with a shot to right-center.
</P>
<P>
   Even with lefthanded batter Lee Stevens coming up, Williams, who
also had righthander Kip Gross warming, called for Wakefield. The
knuckleballer fell behind, 2-0, to Stevens before getting the
benefit of a high strike called by home plate umpire Rick Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens then muscled a knuckler to John Valentin at third, who
threw him out at first. Former Red Sox second baseman Luis Alicea
pinch hit for shortstop Kelly Dransfeldt and flew out to Trot Nixon
in right, preserving the win and ending a stretch of five straight
games in which the Red Sox had blown a save and six out of seven
since Gordon went down.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't a novelty,'' said Williams. ``He's been a reliever
before. Maybe it was a different look. If ever he was going to go
out there in relief, it was going to be today.''
</P>
<P>
   The few scouts who were around the ballpark, who normally like
to clock the speed of the closer's pitches, turned off their radar
guns.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Wakefield had done to change his approach worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a game of adjustments and I hadn't been making them
mentally,'' he said. ``Tonight, it worked out. I helped win a game
and I'm happy about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield could not explain the dynamic of being the pitcher who
closes a game as opposed to one who starts and gets the win. But he
probably was going to go home to think about it and hope it carries
over into his start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I might get a chance in middle relief, but I was
surprised I got in there in the ninth,'' said Wakefield. ``My job
was come in and keep the runner on first and get the guys out at
the plate. It worked out tonight.''

ALLISON'S GOAL PROVIDES SHOT OF CONFIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The puck was in the net, tucked neatly over Dominik
Hasek's left shoulder and it was, oh, about one one-millionth of a
second later that the obvious thought crossed Byron Dafoe's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' said Dafoe, ``we got our one.''
</P>
<P>
   There would be more, of course, three to be exact, before the
Bruins exited the Vault with their 4-2 playoff win Thursday &UR;  &LR; night
over the Sabres. But Allison's first goal of the post-season was
the biggest, because it provided that instant booster shot of
confidence that Hasek so seldomly affords the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   For proof of that, if you need it, go to your favorite Internet
provider and plug in the key words ``Hasek'' and ``Nagano.''
Warning: You may get a blank screen, which is precisely what the
rest of the world saw when facing the Dominator in the 1998
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Allison, without a goal in Boston's first-round victory over
Carolina, played his most impressive game since joining the Bruins
just over two years ago. He was strong on the puck, at times
looking like an elongated, somewhat gangly Peter Forsberg, the
heralded Avalanche centerman who is as tough to knock off the puck
as Alan Dershowitz is to knock off the Larry King Show.
</P>
<P>
   With 6:01 to go in the first period, Allison gained the blue
line on right wing and did a power sashe past Buffalo defenseman
Richard Smehlik. In order to keep his pace to the net, Allison had
to suffer a healthy bump from the 6-foot-3-inch defenseman, but
just kept skating, throwing off the whack as if it were just a
pesty gnat along Alligator Alley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing, really,'' said Allison. ``As long as I've got the
puck on the outside, he can hit you on the arms, or the leg, that
really doesn't make much of a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the sequence had Hasek dropping down to cover the
ice at the right post and Allison roofing a short wrister to the
top right corner. Come game's end, the Bruins would show 46 minutes
and 1 second of lead time. When Hasek's at his best, he can go
substantial chunks of the season without working in arrears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I elevated my game a little,'' said Allison, who
tallied six assists in the six games vs. Carolina, but couldn't
once dent the net. ``I thought I controlled it sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   He was in complete control again at 15:21 of the second period
when the Bruins boosted the lead to 2-0. He swooshed behind the net
and dished out from behind with a perfect relay to charging,
slightly gambling Kyle McLaren. Dmitri Khristich finished off the
play with a bunt at the left post, but it was Allison's sweet feed
to the opportunistic McLaren that provided all the footwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Jason was going to give it to me even before he
did,'' said McLaren. ``Jason played well. He's one of our better
players. When he's got it going at his pace, and he controls the
game, he's a pretty good player.''
</P>
<P>
   It was clear before this series began that the Bruins would be
in for a long battle if the Allison-Khristich-Sergei Samsonov
combination didn't come alive. Khristich also popped in the
end-of-game empty-netter, which left he and Allison with a combined
3-1_4 for the evening. If Khristich had missed on the long-range
empty-netter, it would have meant a faceoff in the Boston zone with
about 12 seconds to play. Sometimes the right things happen for all
the wrong reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Allison finished with a team-high four shots (all in the first
period) and went an impressive 14 for 22 on faceoffs (63 percent).
He showed more jump than in any of his six games against the
'Canes. The Sabres don't attack with Carolina's force and ferocity,
but they have a more sustained, relentless attack, one with a
little less forechecking than Carolina showed but one with a much
smarter, refined system in the neutral zone (read: the dreaded
trap).
</P>
<P>
   ``They're more controlled,'' said Anson Carter, the
opening-series standout. ``In the neutral zone, it's like we're
playing against ourselves _ our two games are so much alike.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe did more than match Hasek save for save. For one night,
the Bruins had the better goalie. That can be debated, if you want
to say the Bruins' shots were unstoppable (essentially Pat Burns's
point in the post-game news conference). But Dafoe faced more shots
and made better stops, by a wide margin. He out-Haseked Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   Is that enough for the Bruins to win this series? Yes.
</P>
<P>
   But will this series come down to Dafoe outplaying Hasek? Very
doubtful. Because, just as Hasek is human, so, too, is Dafoe, and
the Sabres put on an impressive show, extremely impressive, for
more than 40 minutes. Dafoe alone won't win the series if the
Sabres can keep coming with that game. They'll get their goals.
</P>
<P>
   Which leads us back to Mssrs. Allison, Khristich and Samsonov,
the latter of whom didn't land a single shot and didn't factor at
all in the scoring. It would be unfair to say it's all up to
Allison from here, but for Game 1, it was all up to Allison.
Khristich's goals were gimmes, but he does at least get credit for
being in the right place (not always true against Carolina).
</P>
<P>
   Hasek will get better. The Sabres will keep up their persistent
attack. What they have to do now is come back with the same game
and tie up Allison. Then it will be up to the Bruins to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't going to beat Buffalo with one guy going,'' Said
Carter, ``or with one line going. They're too good a team for
that.''

DAFOE OVERSHADOWED, NOT OUTPERFORMED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He's a finalist for the Vezina Trophy. He had two
shutouts in the Bruins' opening playoff series, a 1.46
goals-against average, and a scoreless streak that ran to nearly
135 minutes before it ended Thursday &UR;  &LR; night. But Byron Dafoe is the
Other Goaltender in this series, and he accepts that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all Dominik Hasek, Dominik Hasek, and how are we going
to beat him?'' Dafoe acknowledged after the Bruins had solved Hasek
for three goals to take the quarterfinal opener from Buffalo, 4-2,
at the FleetCenter. ``He's done it for so long. He's been
considered the top guy. He makes these unbelievable saves, and
people expect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, nobody expected that from Dafoe. But
Thursday &UR;  &LR; night his 28 saves, a dozen of them in the middle period,
kept the Bruins topside in a grinder of a hockey game that figures
to be followed by four or five or six just like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how the whole series is going to be, low-scoring,''
said Dafoe, after he'd backstopped his mates to their fourth
straight victory. ``Every goal is going to be big.''
</P>
<P>
   While his mates were putting a pair of huge goals past The
Dominator, Dafoe was calmly keeping the Sabres off the board the
same way he'd shut down Carolina. And he did his best work when
Buffalo was down a goal and on the power play early in the second
period.
</P>
<P>
   After shrugging aside a bid by Joe Juneau, Dafoe kicked out a
55-foot bomb by Geoff Sanderson that had equalizer written all over
it. ``Was it Sanderson?'' Dafoe said. ``I just see the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubber is rubber, he figures, and Dafoe has been stopping enough
of it with high stakes that the Lord Byron Fan Club is grousing _
especially after Thursday &UR;  &LR; night _ that he deserves to have his
name up on the marquee alongside Hasek's. So why isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because his name is Byron Dafoe and not Dominik Hasek,'' said
Bruins coach Pat Burns. ``Byron is gaining steps in the NHL. He's a
kid who's getting his recognition now. Byron has never gotten the
credit. Now, he's getting his due.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres, who didn't crack Dafoe until defenseman Alexei
Zhitnik blasted one off him on the power play (``I was mad at
myself,'' Dafoe said, ``because I knew I was there and I thought I
had it''), knew he'd be far from a simple sieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came into the league with Dafoe and he's gotten better and
better and better,'' said Jason Woolley, who scored Buffalo's
second goal through a partial screen with Dafoe down. ``He's got a
little bit of Dominik in him. He's very acrobatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe needed to be down the stretch, when the Sabres had yanked
Hasek and were buzzing the Boston end desperately trying to pop
something in and force overtime. ``They gave us everything they
had,'' Dafoe said. ``They showed us they can come when they want
to.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the siren went off, the Bruins had a critical victory _
but only one. ``We haven't accomplished anything,'' Dafoe shrugged.
``We're supposed to win the home-ice games. If we don't win the
next one, this won't mean anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, history shows that the Sabres, who've won only one of
their previous six playoff series with the Bruins, are usually dead
meat (as in 1-15 lifetime) when they lose the opener. There are
times when one victory is more than one victory.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe is familiar with history and he'll admit to peeking at the
statistics. He knows his current numbers can stand with Hasek's,
and he also knows that Thursday &UR;  &LR; night's story was that the Bruins
beat The Dominator. No problem, muses the Other Goaltender. ``I
don't mind getting second fiddle,'' he said. ``I'll quietly go
through this series.''

<P>
   So far, the West's war against Serbia has been a shambles.
</P>
<P>
   The humanitarian catastrophe it was designed to avert has merely
been intensified.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a million people, over half of Kosovo's population, have
been driven from their homes; thousands are missing, perhaps dead.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's military machine looks defiantly intact: barely a score
of its 1,300-odd tanks have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Dazzled by technology and obsessed with avoiding casualties of
their own, the allies seem unable even to hurt, let alone destroy,
Serbia's army.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the list of accidents _ innocents bombed, aircraft
lost _ grows longer, and Slobodan Milosevic sits tight, waiting for
cracks to open in the western alliance.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the alliance is holding together _ just. If that is to
continue, the allies must start to speak with a single, consistent
voice about their aims, taking a clear view about what is bound to
be a long involvement, and thinking through the consequences of the
choices that lie before them.
</P>
<P>
   The five initial aims were explicit. They were that the refugees
should be able to return safely home; that all Serb forces should
withdraw from Kosovo; that an international military force should
oversee peace on the ground; that Kosovo should be granted a wide
measure of autonomy; and that a multi-ethnic democracy should be
entrenched.
</P>
<P>
   To those five, some alliance leaders have added two more:
Milosevic must be overthrown; and a military victory must somehow
be won without NATO's forces fighting on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   These two extras, however desirable, should never have been
turned into outright aims _ not least because they may be mutually
incompatible. They should be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   As for autonomy and multi-ethnic democracy, after six weeks of
bombing and ethnic cleansing, they look more and more like distant
dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo, if it is to be anything, must for the foreseeable future
become some kind of international protectorate, ideally authorized
by the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Its final status and territorial shape can be left vague,
matters perhaps for a conference of interested parties in ten years
or so, when, who knows, other Balkan boundaries, maybe including
Bosnia's, can be redrawn.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, it would be unwise to insist now either on
independence for Kosovo as the sole road to a lasting peace or, as
some argue, on partitioning the province. Neither possibility
should be ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   The important points to emphasize, however, are that people of
all ethnic groups and religions should be free to live in peace in
Kosovo, and that Serbs should have access to their holy places.
</P>
<P>
   As for the overthrow of Milosevic as a precondition for peace,
as Britain's Tony Blair and several Americans have insisted, that
is unwise. His expulsion by force would probably prove hideously
difficult, as well as intensely controversial abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, today, even more than in the past, there is no serious
alternative to him as a leader of the Serbs. The war has
strengthened him at home, and most of those who might replace him
are as obnoxious as he is.
</P>
<P>
   It is peace, not war, that is likely to be his eventual undoing.
</P>
<P>
   The West's disavowal of a ground war was from the outset a
mistake. A huge buildup of troops, able to fight in Kosovo, would
not have been a commitment to use them, but would have provided the
option _ and created uncertainty in the enemy's mind.
</P>
<P>
   A decision to invade on the ground would, it is true, be a last
resort: it would be militarily difficult and politically divisive.
But such difficulties and divisions might be less grave than an
outright defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Bombing may yet do the trick, but it is not too late for NATO to
start building up its forces now, to be ready to go in if the worst
comes to the worst, and to intimidate Milosevic in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, far more Apache helicopters should be rushed in and
put to immediate ``tank-busting'' use. The slow, accident-prone
arrival of the first 24 has been one of the saddest examples of
NATO's unreadiness in this war.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to hesitate over an opposed invasion (a
logistical nightmare, whose costs might be very great). It is quite
another, and downright immoral, to conduct this action with the aim
of sustaining no allied casualties whatever, knowing that such a
policy means death and devastation for many innocent Kosovars (and
Serbs).
</P>
<P>
   With a bigger stick to hand, the West can also afford to talk,
using Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The allies and Russia have narrowed their differences enough to
prepare a joint statement this week, and further compromise should
be possible, on, for instance, a bombing pause during a Serb
military withdrawal, or the exact nature of the authority that is
to run Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But on the central issue of what should be at the core of the
peacekeeping force there should be no concession: it must be, in
essence, a NATO-run affair, preferably blessed, Bosnian-style, by
the U.N. and certainly including Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
   Peace or no peace, the West will have a huge refugee problem on
its hands. Germany has been conspicuously generous; other
countries, such as Britain, have been conspicuously ungenerous,
though that may be changing.
</P>
<P>
   Far more help must also go to Kosovo's neighbors, Albania and
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   But the top priority is that America, the key to the entire
affair, should steel itself for the possibility of a protracted war
involving allied casualties. Bill Clinton must recognize that
brutal truth, and tell the world forthwith. &QL;

<P>
   Perhaps Wan Azizah Ismail is not yet a household name, even in
her own country, Malaysia. But then it was not so long ago that few
people, outside of Arkansas, had heard of Hillary Rodham, yet now
it seems her political career may well continue long after her
husband's.
</P>
<P>
   What future then for Dr. Wan Azizah, the wife of Anwar Ibrahim,
formerly Malaysia's deputy prime minister and now its most famous
convict?
</P>
<P>
   She has just been in the Philippines, talking to Corazon Aquino.
Once Mrs. Aquino, too, was just the wife of a persecuted opposition
leader. She went on to become her country's president.
</P>
<P>
   All right, the Philippines is not Malaysia, and history seldom
repeats itself exactly, in Asia or anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it sometimes seems that Asian women who want to get on in
politics would be well advised simply to marry a man with the same
ambition. Even if that fails to get them to the top, it may be that
their daughter, or daughter-in-law, will fulfill their ambition.
</P>
<P>
   The downside, it should be added, is a seriously disturbed
family life, usually involving exile, imprisonment and, almost
invariably, assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Widows' politics is especially eye-catching in the Philippines
because of the personalities involved: the redoubtable Mrs. Aquino
and the well-heeled, indeed well-shod, Imelda Marcos, whose husband
was the dictator Mrs. Aquino deposed.
</P>
<P>
   The Philippine variant of this kind of politics exhibits some
familiar features _ Benigno Aquino was assassinated, Ferdinand
Marcos died in exile _ but it has yet to develop fully into a
multigenerational affair.
</P>
<P>
   There are some signs of that in Myanmar, where Aung San Suu Kyi,
even under house arrest, bravely carries the torch for democracy
amid the darkness imposed by the ruling junta.
</P>
<P>
   She is the daughter of Aung San, who negotiated his country's
independence but did not live to see it: he was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia, the independence leader was Sukarno. His daughter,
Megawati, hopes to win the presidency in next month's election.
</P>
<P>
   For the genre in its most elaborate form, however, go to Sri
Lanka, where the president, Chandrika Kumaratunga, is the daughter
of two prime ministers. Dad came first, but was, yes, assassinated,
in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Mum, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, took over in 1960, becoming the
world's first elected female head of government. She no longer has
that job, but she is still prime minister (the post carries much
less weight now). Mrs. Kumaratunga's husband was assassinated in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries in South Asia are also exponents of widows' and
daughters' politics.
</P>
<P>
   Bangladesh, for example, is these days alternately ruled by
Sheikh Hasina Wajed, the current prime minister, and Khaleda Zia,
her predecessor. The former is the daughter of Sheikh Mujib ur
Rahman, the country's first prime minister, assassinated in 1975;
the latter the relict of President Zia Rahman, assassinated six
years later.
</P>
<P>
   In Pakistan, Benazir Bhutto is a former prime minister, no
stranger to either jail or exile; her father, an earlier prime
minister, was hanged, or, as some would say, judicially
assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   It takes the world's biggest democracy, however, to produce
Asia's greatest dynasty, replete with both daughters' and widows'
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister, begat Indira
Gandhi, its third and sixth prime minister (assassinated 1984), who
begat Rajiv, its seventh (assassinated 1991), whose widow, Sonia,
now hopes to become its 15th.
</P>
<P>
   So what conclusion should Dr. Wan Azizah draw from all this?
Certainly, that politics can be a dangerous avocation in Asia, for
women as for men. But perhaps too that wives and daughters perform
no worse, as a rule, than anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it would be nice to see more women win power on their
merits, not on their husbands' or fathers' names.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the most popular alternative route, at least in
India, is through the movies _ and that, to judge by the capers of
Jayaram Jayalalitha, who has just brought down the Indian
government, hardly seems to engender a sense of responsibility. &QL;

   She has just been in the Philippines, talking to Corazon Aquino.
Once Mrs. Aquino, too, was just the wife of a persecuted opposition
leader. She went on to become her country's president.
</P>
<P>
   All right, the Philippines is not Malaysia, and history seldom
repeats itself exactly, in Asia or anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it sometimes seems that Asian women who want to get on in
politics would be well advised simply to marry a man with the same
ambition. Even if that fails to get them to the top, it may be that
their daughter, or daughter-in-law, will fulfill their ambition.
</P>
<P>
   The downside, it should be added, is a seriously disturbed
family life, usually involving exile, imprisonment and, almost
invariably, assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Widows' politics is especially eye-catching in the Philippines
because of the personalities involved: the redoubtable Mrs. Aquino
and the well-heeled, indeed well-shod, Imelda Marcos, whose husband
was the dictator Mrs. Aquino deposed.
</P>
<P>
   The Philippine variant of this kind of politics exhibits some
familiar features _ Benigno Aquino was assassinated, Ferdinand
Marcos died in exile _ but it has yet to develop fully into a
multigenerational affair.
</P>
<P>
   There are some signs of that in Myanmar, where Aung San Suu Kyi,
even under house arrest, bravely carries the torch for democracy
amid the darkness imposed by the ruling junta.
</P>
<P>
   She is the daughter of Aung San, who negotiated his country's
independence but did not live to see it: he was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia, the independence leader was Sukarno. His daughter,
Megawati, hopes to win the presidency in next month's election.
</P>
<P>
   For the genre in its most elaborate form, however, go to Sri
Lanka, where the president, Chandrika Kumaratunga, is the daughter
of two prime ministers. Dad came first, but was, yes, assassinated,
in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Mum, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, took over in 1960, becoming the
world's first elected female head of government. She no longer has
that job, but she is still prime minister (the post carries much
less weight now). Mrs. Kumaratunga's husband was assassinated in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries in South Asia are also exponents of widows' and
daughters' politics.
</P>
<P>
   Bangladesh, for example, is these days alternately ruled by
Sheikh Hasina Wajed, the current prime minister, and Khaleda Zia,
her predecessor. The former is the daughter of Sheikh Mujib ur
Rahman, the country's first prime minister, assassinated in 1975;
the latter the relict of President Zia Rahman, assassinated six
years later.
</P>
<P>
   In Pakistan, Benazir Bhutto is a former prime minister, no
stranger to either jail or exile; her father, an earlier prime
minister, was hanged, or, as some would say, judicially
assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   It takes the world's biggest democracy, however, to produce
Asia's greatest dynasty, replete with both daughters' and widows'
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister, begat Indira
Gandhi, its third and sixth prime minister (assassinated 1984), who
begat Rajiv, its seventh (assassinated 1991), whose widow, Sonia,
now hopes to become its 15th.
</P>
<P>
   So what conclusion should Dr. Wan Azizah draw from all this?
Certainly, that politics can be a dangerous avocation in Asia, for
women as for men. But perhaps too that wives and daughters perform
no worse, as a rule, than anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it would be nice to see more women win power on their
merits, not on their husbands' or fathers' names.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the most popular alternative route, at least in
India, is through the movies _ and that, to judge by the capers of
Jayaram Jayalalitha, who has just brought down the Indian
government, hardly seems to engender a sense of responsibility. &QL;

   ``When circulating libraries were first opened,'' wrote Charles
Knight in 1854, ``the booksellers were much alarmed; and their
rapid increase added to their fears, and led them to think that the
sale of books would be much diminished by such libraries.
</P>
<P>
   ``But experience has proved that the sale of books, so far from
being diminished by them, has been greatly promoted.''
</P>
<P>
   As it was with books in the late 18th century, so it is with
music today.
</P>
<P>
   A new distribution channel has opened: the Internet. The
question is whether its impact on today's music business will be as
benign as the impact of libraries was on the bookselling business.
</P>
<P>
   After all, today, bookselling still booms _ and, indeed, now
flourishes online, where a bookseller has become the best-known
brand. The circulating libraries are gone.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, it looked as though the Internet might ring the
death knell of the music business.
</P>
<P>
   Because music is so easily compressed and sold online, the
record companies feared that their intellectual property would be
stolen by the bucketful. With the help of a common standard adopted
by websites, consumers and hardware producers, Internet music
boomed and sales of CDs to the young declined.
</P>
<P>
   Panic-stricken, the companies rang their lawyers; they sent
fierce letters to colleges, warning students against piracy; they
sued one of the producers of the devices on to which music can be
downloaded; and they forced bands to remove tracks that they had
posted on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, technology seems likely to rescue the music
companies from the threat technology has created.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are trying to replace the Internet's standard for
digital download with their own, which would allow them to encrypt
their product, and thus protect their copyright.
</P>
<P>
   On May 4 the first of the big music companies, Universal,
announced plans to sell music online. As a result, music is likely
to become the most valuable product to make the move from the
physical world to the virtual.
</P>
<P>
   By selling their wares online, the record companies will not
only save the costs of manufacturing and distribution. They will
save on stocks _ indeed, they will be able to keep unlimited
supplies of golden oldies, since the virtual world offers unlimited
storage space.
</P>
<P>
   And they will get rid of the costly business of dealing with
returns of CDs that flop, because nobody will buy them in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   For music-lovers, this is a happy song. Scrapping distribution
costs means slashing the price of music _ and probably bypassing
the taxman too, in many countries.
</P>
<P>
   It means quick access to new music. For the massed ranks of the
middle-aged who have neither the time nor the inclination to hang
out in record stores, rubbing stubble with the hip, it means pure
joy: at the click of a mouse, they will be able to download that
seminal Beach Boys album.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder online sales are already broadening the customer base.
</P>
<P>
   For record stores, though, this is glum news. Unless they can
find a new role _ as music clubs, perhaps, or coffee houses _ their
days are limited.
</P>
<P>
   And for the record companies themselves, this will be a mixed
blessing. Between them, they control most of the music that has
ever been recorded _ including that ancient Beach Boys special,
whose initial costs have long since been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Back lists will thus be played con brio and with profit. But,
like publishers, airlines, stockbrokers and any other firm whose
product can be readily distributed online, the record companies now
have to rethink the way they do business.
</P>
<P>
   If they no longer make and distribute CDs, what are they for?
Plugging artists, presumably. But here there is plenty of
competition _ from agents, from managers, even the artists
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, manufacturing plants and distribution networks
created sizeable barriers to entry which kept upstarts out of the
record companies' business. In the new world, physical capital is a
costly overhead, not a protection.
</P>
<P>
   In this new era, the record companies have a further
disadvantage: everybody dislikes them. Artists dislike them because
they think the record companies rip them off. Consumers dislike
them because the artists dislike them.
</P>
<P>
   Because Internet businesses are increasingly about building a
community of loyal users, record companies must learn to be loved
if they are to flourish like booksellers rather than go the way of
the circulating library. &QL;

<P>
   The contours of a settlement for Kosovo were sketched out at a
meeting of Russian and western foreign ministers on May 6 in Bonn,
though not the all-important details.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably too soon to proclaim an early peace. But the
developments are bad news for Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Using careful diplomatic language to paper over their
differences, the ministers agreed that an ``effective international
civil and security presence'' would be needed to police any peace
deal and to oversee the return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   In a huge step towards imposing an international protectorate on
Kosovo, they also called for an ``interim administration'' of the
province which would be appointed by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The gradual _ but not total _ convergence of Russian and western
views on Kosovo is potentially a much greater threat to Milosevic
than NATO's continuing bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   The allies' strikes managed this week to disrupt Serbia's
electricity system but have still had trouble in finding enemy
aircraft and armor.
</P>
<P>
   Joschka Fischer, the German foreign minister, said after playing
host to his colleagues from the G7 rich nations and Russia that it
was too early to speak of an immediate halt to NATO's bombs.
</P>
<P>
   But the breakthrough in Bonn could pave the way for a U.N.
Security Council resolution that would lend international authority
to a peace formula and redouble the pressure on Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Milosevic, though, there are important issues on
which the West and Russia remain at odds, despite this week's visit
to Washington by Viktor Chernomyrdin, acting as President Boris
Yeltsin's Kosovo envoy.
</P>
<P>
   At least some senior Russians, including Igor Sergeyev, the
defense minister, sympathize with Serbia's insistence that western
countries which have taken part in bombing have no moral right to
police a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, for its part, insists on forming the main component of any
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that Russia and the West are talking, rather than
rattling sabres at each other, must disappoint those in Belgrade
still hoping that Russia will switch from passive to active support
of the Serb cause.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, reckons that Russia has
become more favorable to cooperating with NATO since the alliance
rejected British calls for an open commitment to a ground war.
Serbia's hawks have certainly held the view that Russia would
switch back to a more firmly anti-western position if NATO embarked
on a ground war.
</P>
<P>
   Hints of what this could mean have been provided, in recent
days, by the Russian Security Council's call for a new nuclear
doctrine. In any event, Milosevic is unlikely to rely too heavily
on the uncertain prospect of Russian support.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing that he might lose his (hitherto impressive) ability to
set the pace of events, Milosevic has been taking every available
opportunity to set off diplomatic fireworks of his own.
</P>
<P>
   His decision over the May Day weekend to free three captured
American servicemen _ in response to an appeal from Jesse Jackson,
a pastor-politician _ was accompanied by a stream of proposals for
direct talks with President Bill Clinton, as well as appeals to the
American people.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is also working on a peace plan of his own, which
would provide for a lightly armed U.N. police force, including a
large Russian component and NATO countries such as Greece,
Portugal, Hungary and Poland, which have not dropped any bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The most eye-catching gesture was the release of Ibrahim Rugova,
the Kosovar Albanians' moderate leader, who has been under Serb
``protection'' in recent weeks, to talk peace in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another diplomatic initiative is being jointly pursued by
some American legislators, including a Republican arms-control
expert, Curt Weldon, and members of the Russian parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Hovering in the background of their meeting in Vienna last week,
which produced agreement on the broad outlines of a settlement, was
the influential figure of Dragan Karic, one of three Serbian
brothers whose business empire straddles Moscow and Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   As though to underline the gap between these initiatives and
anything he might accept, Clinton promised during a visit to an
American base in Germany this week to ``intensify...in an
unrelenting way'' the air attacks against Serbia until the
objectives were met.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, on a trip to NATO headquarters in Brussels, he had
agreed with alliance commanders on the need for a large force to be
ready to roll into Kosovo to escort refugees home ``once we have
prevailed'' _ through bombing. &QL;

<P>
   General Hugh Shelton, the chairman of America's joint chiefs of
staff, issued a grim warning against the assumption that incoming
NATO troops would have an easy time of it.
</P>
<P>
   If, he insisted, circumstances in Kosovo were
``non-permissive...we'll assume we could face hostile action and
prepare our forces accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports from the war zone, meanwhile, suggested a close
correlation between the intensity of NATO's air strikes and the
brutality of the Serbs' repression _ but not of the kind NATO
intended.
</P>
<P>
   On May 3, for example, NATO claimed its ``most successful'' day
of bombing so far, with attacks on tanks and artillery in Kosovo
and about 40 fixed targets elsewhere in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, an exceptionally brutal round of ethnic
cleansing was carried out by the Serbs, with sickening atrocities
reported around Vucitrn and Podujevo in northern Kosovo, as well as
Prizren in the south.
</P>
<P>
   The latest refugees arriving by tractor in Albania and by train
in Macedonia are hungry, exhausted and traumatized by experiences
whose horror far exceeds that of the opening weeks of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Many have seen close relations sadistically murdered, and walked
past piles of newly slaughtered, often mutilated, bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Their stories, and physical condition, have shocked the most
hardened aid workers. But NATO acknowledges there is little it can
do immediately to prevent such horrors or even to ward off the
threat of starvation among Kosovo's internally displaced people.
</P>
<P>
   NATO forces in both Albania and Macedonia are vulnerable to
Serbia's Orkan multiple rocket-launchers, and America's
much-vaunted fleet of 24 Apache helicopters, deployed in Albania,
suffered a second crash this week, resulting in NATO's first two
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the darkest assessment of NATO's progress was offered by
the outgoing chairman of the alliance's Military Committee, General
Klaus Naumann, a German, on May 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly and honestly, we did not succeed in our initial
attempt to coerce Milosevic through air strikes to accept our
demands, nor did we succeed in preventing Yugoslavia from pursuing
a campaign of ethnic separation and expulsion,'' he conceded.
</P>
<P>
   NATO might have fared better, he suggested, if it had dropped
even more bombs even sooner, and been less constrained by the need
to avoid hitting civilians, churches and mosques.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, there was still a ``real chance we can make it'' and
prevail in Kosovo through air power alone, the general thought. But
it was also possible, he admitted, that Milosevic might succeed in
his plan to deport the entire ethnic-Albanian population. &QL;

 c.1999 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time was when Latin American governments tried to do everything,
from industrialization on. They had some successes, and then,
mostly, got bogged down (or worse).
</P>
<P>
   Then _ headed by Chile's military regime, which had inherited an
extensively statist economy from the socialist government it
overthrew in 1973 _ they discovered privatization. On the block
went public-sector industries and banks, oil and mining, utilities,
transport, telecoms.
</P>
<P>
   Now the privatizers have a new target: the welfare state, in
particular, health care.
</P>
<P>
   Most countries in the region began to develop social-security
systems in the 1940s; some even earlier.
</P>
<P>
   These schemes, providing pensions and health care to the new
urban middle classes, did much in their early decades, becoming as
popular and entrenched as their European equivalents. But monopoly,
mismanagement and lack of money led many to become ineffective,
often inequitable and sometimes corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Now-spurred on by the World Bank and the Inter-American
Development Bank, both eager to diversify beyond infrastructure
lending-governments are turning to the market to put things right.
</P>
<P>
   Though the region's new democrats dislike admitting it, it was
the Pinochet regime in Chile that led the way in social services,
as it had in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, it inherited over 250 state enterprises. By 1980, it
had cut the total to fewer than 50. That was bold, maybe, but not
amazing: in 1970, before President Salvador Allende set to work,
the figure had been only 20 higher.
</P>
<P>
   What followed in 1981 was far bolder, almost unthinkable at the
time: Chileans got the right to opt out of the state health
service.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they were offered a choice of new, private-sector
health insurers, known as Isapres. These bodies act like American
health-maintenance organizations, HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   They contract with hospitals and doctors to provide care, or
manage and hire for themselves. They have flourished. In 1981,
62,000 Chileans entrusted their health care to Isapres; by 1998,
some 3.8 million, about a quarter of the entire population.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the shift was not easy. The similar opt-out provision
introduced in 1981 for pensions was soon popular _ within a year 30
percent of eligible Chileans had made the switch _ and has been
widely imitated elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Health has proved trickier. Privatizing pensions costs
relatively few public-sector jobs, and has (mostly) met only mild
opposition, whether from ideological foes or the trade unions
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Health care, in contrast, is highly labor-intensive. The unions
tend to be strong, and fear that many thousands of jobs are at
risk.
</P>
<P>
   True, new private-sector jobs would be created in their place,
but no longer under union control. The Pinochet regime had its own
crude ways of dealing with union opposition. Later reforms
elsewhere have involved hard-fought political battles.
</P>
<P>
   There are other big differences. A pension is easily measured.
Health care is not. As in the United States, private-sector
insurers in Latin America face suspicion that they will cut corners
in treatment (and, conversely, that doctors will try to earn extra
fees _ part of which still fall on the user, albeit insured _ by
carrying out unneeded procedures).
</P>
<P>
   And the range of costs is far wider: some people are healthy
most of the time, some chronically ill for years on end. So there
has to be greater cross-subsidy-between rich and poor, healthy and
sick _ and more regulation, to ensure that all get tolerably equal
access to similar levels of care. In short, more politics.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder that even in rich Europe (ask Britain's Conservative
Party) voters distrust the idea of taking the state out of medical
care.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Chile's example has been followed. In 1993 Colombia
opened the way for people to opt for private health insurers, known
there as EPSs.
</P>
<P>
   This reform sought to bring in the efficiencies and consumer
satisfaction that had won Chile's Isapres public acceptance, but
also to offer better care to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The main way to that was to bring more people into the
social-security net: coverage rose from 6 million in 1993 to 22
million in 1996, including 7 million poorer folk whose premiums are
paid by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Peru is now creating a similar system. At the start of this
year, its social-security institute, Essalud, was told that it too
would have to compete with private EPSs for members; it may also
contract with an EPS to provide care.
</P>
<P>
   For now, EPSs will handle only primary and out-patient services,
leaving Essalud to provide hospital care. But the goal is
competition across the board.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina is moving in the same direction, though timidly, and
against much resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Its workers and their families have traditionally had compulsory
health insurance with one of more than 200 obras sociales, operated
by their respective trade union. These are often small, inefficient
and, sometimes, corruptly managed.
</P>
<P>
   So in 1996 a decree allowed the 18 million people involved at
least to choose a rival union's obra. But not many have done so.
</P>
<P>
   Reformers in Mexico seem keen to follow the trend. A 1995 law _
it also opened the way to private pensions _ already allows
opted-out health care. But it has not been fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil has already seen a large switch to the private sector _
less by design than because of discontent with the state system
since it was opened to all comers in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Over 45 million Brazilians were covered by private health plans
in 1998, four times the 1988 figure. Many others are treated in
private hospitals, under contract to the public system. Coverage
and levels of treatment vary widely from one city or state to the
next.
</P>
<P>
   Greater uniformity may be difficult, given Brazil's
decentralized system. The central government is concentrating on
encouraging more efficient contracting-out and on regulating the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Why make the change? Why have Latin American governments become
ready to privatize health care, when in Europe (and Canada)
governments have been decidedly less bold?
</P>
<P>
   One reason is external prompting and support. Last year Mexico
benefited from a World Bank loan of $750 million, mostly directed
at ``structural'' change in the social-security institute's
health-care operations. That is the biggest loan the Bank has ever
made for health care.
</P>
<P>
   The Inter-American Development Bank too is pushing market-based
reforms. It hired Juan Luis Londono, the Colombian health minister
responsible for the 1993 reforms, to help.
</P>
<P>
   The two banks have begun an unusual joint loan of $650 million
to Brazil, mainly to stimulate health-sector reform.
</P>
<P>
   But the impetus for change comes also _ and quite as strongly _
from within: from a new breed of policymaker within Latin America's
finance and health ministries.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Griffin, the World Bank's foremost health specialist for
the region, says these officials, home-grown though often armed
with economics degrees from North American universities, are
producing unprecedented and welcome ``creativity and risk-taking''
throughout the area. &QL;

   Chilean Isapres and Colombian EPSs are launching themselves
abroad, marketing their experience of middle-income markets.
Conversely, foreign managed-care providers are entering the region
rapidly, especially from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Lewis, the president of the American Association of
Health Plans, explains why: ``450 million Latin Americans
constitute a health-care market of $120 billion a year _ of which
only 15 percent is spent on private insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   The care at present on offer, he points out, is of uneven
quality, and, in the public sector, usually underfinanced.
</P>
<P>
   It is also rationed by income. Though insured, users have to pay
much of their health-care costs themselves; on average 45 percent
of total spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a perfect environment for managed care to demonstrate
its commitment to cost-effective, high-quality health care,''
claims Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   American HMOs will have to adapt their ways and their costs to
this new market-to ``tropicalize'' as one executive puts it. But
the potential is huge.
</P>
<P>
   Home-grown or foreign-controlled, private-sector providers will
be grabbing for, and probably getting, an ever larger share of it. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Time was when Latin American governments tried to do everything,
from industrialization on. They had some successes, and then,
mostly, got bogged down (or worse).
</P>
<P>
   Then _ headed by Chile's military regime, which had inherited an
extensively statist economy from the socialist government it
overthrew in 1973 _ they discovered privatization. On the block
went public-sector industries and banks, oil and mining, utilities,
transport, telecoms.
</P>
<P>
   Now the privatizers have a new target: the welfare state, in
particular, health care.
</P>
<P>
   Most countries in the region began to develop social-security
systems in the 1940s; some even earlier.
</P>
<P>
   These schemes, providing pensions and health care to the new
urban middle classes, did much in their early decades, becoming as
popular and entrenched as their European equivalents. But monopoly,
mismanagement and lack of money led many to become ineffective,
often inequitable and sometimes corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Now-spurred on by the World Bank and the Inter-American
Development Bank, both eager to diversify beyond infrastructure
lending-governments are turning to the market to put things right.
</P>
<P>
   Though the region's new democrats dislike admitting it, it was
the Pinochet regime in Chile that led the way in social services,
as it had in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, it inherited over 250 state enterprises. By 1980, it
had cut the total to fewer than 50. That was bold, maybe, but not
amazing: in 1970, before President Salvador Allende set to work,
the figure had been only 20 higher.
</P>
<P>
   What followed in 1981 was far bolder, almost unthinkable at the
time: Chileans got the right to opt out of the state health
service.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they were offered a choice of new, private-sector
health insurers, known as Isapres. These bodies act like American
health-maintenance organizations, HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   They contract with hospitals and doctors to provide care, or
manage and hire for themselves. They have flourished. In 1981,
62,000 Chileans entrusted their health care to Isapres; by 1998,
some 3.8 million, about a quarter of the entire population.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the shift was not easy. The similar opt-out provision
introduced in 1981 for pensions was soon popular _ within a year 30
percent of eligible Chileans had made the switch _ and has been
widely imitated elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Health has proved trickier. Privatizing pensions costs
relatively few public-sector jobs, and has (mostly) met only mild
opposition, whether from ideological foes or the trade unions
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Health care, in contrast, is highly labor-intensive. The unions
tend to be strong, and fear that many thousands of jobs are at
risk.
</P>
<P>
   True, new private-sector jobs would be created in their place,
but no longer under union control. The Pinochet regime had its own
crude ways of dealing with union opposition. Later reforms
elsewhere have involved hard-fought political battles.
</P>
<P>
   There are other big differences. A pension is easily measured.
Health care is not. As in the United States, private-sector
insurers in Latin America face suspicion that they will cut corners
in treatment (and, conversely, that doctors will try to earn extra
fees _ part of which still fall on the user, albeit insured _ by
carrying out unneeded procedures).
</P>
<P>
   And the range of costs is far wider: some people are healthy
most of the time, some chronically ill for years on end. So there
has to be greater cross-subsidy-between rich and poor, healthy and
sick _ and more regulation, to ensure that all get tolerably equal
access to similar levels of care. In short, more politics.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder that even in rich Europe (ask Britain's Conservative
Party) voters distrust the idea of taking the state out of medical
care.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Chile's example has been followed. In 1993 Colombia
opened the way for people to opt for private health insurers, known
there as EPSs.
</P>
<P>
   This reform sought to bring in the efficiencies and consumer
satisfaction that had won Chile's Isapres public acceptance, but
also to offer better care to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The main way to that was to bring more people into the
social-security net: coverage rose from 6 million in 1993 to 22
million in 1996, including 7 million poorer folk whose premiums are
paid by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Peru is now creating a similar system. At the start of this
year, its social-security institute, Essalud, was told that it too
would have to compete with private EPSs for members; it may also
contract with an EPS to provide care.
</P>
<P>
   For now, EPSs will handle only primary and out-patient services,
leaving Essalud to provide hospital care. But the goal is
competition across the board.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina is moving in the same direction, though timidly, and
against much resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Its workers and their families have traditionally had compulsory
health insurance with one of more than 200 obras sociales, operated
by their respective trade union. These are often small, inefficient
and, sometimes, corruptly managed.
</P>
<P>
   So in 1996 a decree allowed the 18 million people involved at
least to choose a rival union's obra. But not many have done so.
</P>
<P>
   Reformers in Mexico seem keen to follow the trend. A 1995 law _
it also opened the way to private pensions _ already allows
opted-out health care. But it has not been fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil has already seen a large switch to the private sector _
less by design than because of discontent with the state system
since it was opened to all comers in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Over 45 million Brazilians were covered by private health plans
in 1998, four times the 1988 figure. Many others are treated in
private hospitals, under contract to the public system. Coverage
and levels of treatment vary widely from one city or state to the
next.
</P>
<P>
   Greater uniformity may be difficult, given Brazil's
decentralized system. The central government is concentrating on
encouraging more efficient contracting-out and on regulating the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Why make the change? Why have Latin American governments become
ready to privatize health care, when in Europe (and Canada)
governments have been decidedly less bold?
</P>
<P>
   One reason is external prompting and support. Last year Mexico
benefited from a World Bank loan of $750 million, mostly directed
at ``structural'' change in the social-security institute's
health-care operations. That is the biggest loan the Bank has ever
made for health care.
</P>
<P>
   The Inter-American Development Bank too is pushing market-based
reforms. It hired Juan Luis Londono, the Colombian health minister
responsible for the 1993 reforms, to help.
</P>
<P>
   The two banks have begun an unusual joint loan of $650 million
to Brazil, mainly to stimulate health-sector reform.
</P>
<P>
   But the impetus for change comes also _ and quite as strongly _

<P>
   Bring on the lightsabers.
</P>
<P>
   Ewan McGregor knows what he's getting into. As a star of the
year's most anticipated movie, he'll be the subject of fan frenzy.
He'll be a media magnet. He'll even be an action figure.
</P>
<P>
   Because, after all, he'll be Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi knight, in
``Star Wars: The Phantom Menace,'' the eagerly awaited prequel to
the most popular film of all time that's set to open on May 19.
</P>
<P>
   And, for that matter, in the next two films in the series. We
don't know what will happen in the long-awaited ``first trilogy,''
but we know that McGregor's character has to survive long enough to
reappear as Alec Guinness in the original ``Star Wars'' (1977).
</P>
<P>
   Which means that McGregor will be wielding Obi-Wan's lightsaber
well into the next millennium, which is fine with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of that is great,'' the actor says. ``I've never done
it before. Instead of doing it over eight weeks, it'll be over a
few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old, Scottish-born McGregor, best known for edgy
roles in quirky independent films such as ``Trainspotting'' (1996),
``The Pillow Book'' (1997), ``A Life Less Ordinary'' (1997) and
``Velvet Underground'' (1998), relished the opportunity of stepping
into the mythic role of Obi-Wan Kenobi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got really fond of Guinness by watching him in a lot of his
films,'' McGregor says during a conversation at a New York hotel.
``He's a great actor, and so lovely in the `Star Wars' movies. It's
a lovely character, gentle and kind of fatherly.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an almost religious way, Jedi knights are at one with
themselves,'' he says. ``They're completely centered people, and so
they never get flustered or in a flap about anything. The idea that
they can see into the future is fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   ``To follow Guinness and to play a character who is that
together was appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other Jedi knights and masters who appear in ``Phantom
Menace'' are the diminutive Yoda (Frank Oz), the tough-as-nails
Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) and the swashbuckling Qui-Gon Jinn
(Liam Neeson). But the real master, McGregor says, was
writer/director/kingpin George Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   ``George was great and so smart,'' he says. ``I suppose if
you've got 400 or 500 people running around after you, you can be
as calm or crazy as you like. But George was very calm _ he never
lost his temper.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of film is very hard to do,'' he adds. ``It's a huge
task. George had to watch us, but he also had to be aware of all
the other things that were going to happen, things that no one else
knew were going on.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the challenge of doing a film whose ending is already
known to literally millions of moviegoers _ most of its fans can
quote ``Star Wars'' almost in its entirety _ McGregor promises that
Lucas won't let them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to spend 20 years waiting to do a new `Star
Wars' without pulling the rabbit out of the hat,'' the actor says
sagely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Phantom Menace'' was filmed on location in the Tunisian
desert and at Leavesden Studios in London, both used for the
original film as well. For McGregor, it was a complicated exercise
in suspension of disbelief, working with sets, props and even other
actors that would be added later through the magic of digital
animation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long shoot and very tiring,'' he says. ``I had to
deliver the lines and hope they do the backgrounds nicely. You are
a cog in the machine. I appreciate now that sci-fi movies are very
taxing, very difficult to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Since completing ``The Phantom Menace,'' McGregor has been
shooting more conventional films almost nonstop. He's due to open
soon in the films ``Rogue Trader,'' ``South from Hell's Kitchen,''
``Eye of the Beholder'' and ``Nora,'' a drama that casts him as
Irish novelist James Joyce.
</P>
<P>
   McGregor even found time to appear in a recent London staging of
the play ``Little Malcolm and His Struggle Against Eunuchs,''
directed by his uncle, Denis Lawson. ``Star Wars'' aficionados will
remember that Lawson played Wedge, the X-Wing Red Leader, in the
original trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a tiny part in all three,'' his nephew says, ``and I
think it's rather bemusing to him that he still gets mail from
people. Everyone asks if he'll have a cameo in the movies, but he
can't because Wedge wouldn't be born yet.''
</P>
<P>
   When not working, McGregor says, he's ``a regular bloke'' who
rides his motorcycle, parties hard and relaxes with his wife and
3-year-old daughter, Clara, at their home in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work in my films and then I go and have a life as well,'' he
says. ``You can make life as complicated as you want and, within
reason, you can make it as simple as you like. I've always just
gone about my business.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most regular blokes' business doesn't involve
battling the minions of evil and wielding The Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my own lightsaber,'' he concedes, ``and that's something
the boys will understand. It felt pretty goddamn good!
</P>
<P>
   ``I got home one day,'' he recalls, ``and my wife and some of
her friends were there. I said, `I acted with R2-D2 today,' and
they all went, `Who? What?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Oh, it's a boy thing. Sorry.'''  &QL;

   Bring on the lightsabers.
</P>
<P>
   Ewan McGregor knows what he's getting into. As a star of the
year's most anticipated movie, he'll be the subject of fan frenzy.
He'll be a media magnet. He'll even be an action figure.
</P>
<P>
   Because, after all, he'll be Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi knight, in
``Star Wars: The Phantom Menace,'' the eagerly awaited prequel to
the most popular film of all time that's set to open on May 19.
</P>
<P>
   And, for that matter, in the next two films in the series. We
don't know what will happen in the long-awaited ``first trilogy,''
but we know that McGregor's character has to survive long enough to
reappear as Alec Guinness in the original ``Star Wars'' (1977).
</P>
<P>
   Which means that McGregor will be wielding Obi-Wan's lightsaber
well into the next millennium, which is fine with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of that is great,'' the actor says. ``I've never done
it before. Instead of doing it over eight weeks, it'll be over a
few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old, Scottish-born McGregor, best known for edgy
roles in quirky independent films such as ``Trainspotting'' (1996),
``The Pillow Book'' (1997), ``A Life Less Ordinary'' (1997) and
``Velvet Underground'' (1998), relished the opportunity of stepping
into the mythic role of Obi-Wan Kenobi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got really fond of Guinness by watching him in a lot of his
films,'' McGregor says during a conversation at a New York hotel.
``He's a great actor, and so lovely in the `Star Wars' movies. It's
a lovely character, gentle and kind of fatherly.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an almost religious way, Jedi knights are at one with
themselves,'' he says. ``They're completely centered people, and so
they never get flustered or in a flap about anything. The idea that
they can see into the future is fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   ``To follow Guinness and to play a character who is that
together was appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other Jedi knights and masters who appear in ``Phantom
Menace'' are the diminutive Yoda (Frank Oz), the tough-as-nails
Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) and the swashbuckling Qui-Gon Jinn
(Liam Neeson). But the real master, McGregor says, was
writer/director/kingpin George Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   ``George was great and so smart,'' he says. ``I suppose if
you've got 400 or 500 people running around after you, you can be
as calm or crazy as you like. But George was very calm _ he never
lost his temper.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of film is very hard to do,'' he adds. ``It's a huge
task. George had to watch us, but he also had to be aware of all
the other things that were going to happen, things that no one else
knew were going on.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the challenge of doing a film whose ending is already
known to literally millions of moviegoers _ most of its fans can
quote ``Star Wars'' almost in its entirety _ McGregor promises that
Lucas won't let them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to spend 20 years waiting to do a new `Star
Wars' without pulling the rabbit out of the hat,'' the actor says
sagely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Phantom Menace'' was filmed on location in the Tunisian
desert and at Leavesden Studios in London, both used for the
original film as well. For McGregor, it was a complicated exercise
in suspension of disbelief, working with sets, props and even other
actors that would be added later through the magic of digital
animation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long shoot and very tiring,'' he says. ``I had to
deliver the lines and hope they do the backgrounds nicely. You are
a cog in the machine. I appreciate now that sci-fi movies are very
taxing, very difficult to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Since completing ``The Phantom Menace,'' McGregor has been
shooting more conventional films almost nonstop. He's due to open
soon in the films ``Rogue Trader,'' ``South from Hell's Kitchen,''
``Eye of the Beholder'' and ``Nora,'' a drama that casts him as
Irish novelist James Joyce.
</P>
<P>
   McGregor even found time to appear in a recent London staging of
the play ``Little Malcolm and His Struggle Against Eunuchs,''
directed by his uncle, Denis Lawson. ``Star Wars'' aficionados will
remember that Lawson played Wedge, the X-Wing Red Leader, in the
original trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a tiny part in all three,'' his nephew says, ``and I
think it's rather bemusing to him that he still gets mail from
people. Everyone asks if he'll have a cameo in the movies, but he
can't because Wedge wouldn't be born yet.''
</P>
<P>
   When not working, McGregor says, he's ``a regular bloke'' who
rides his motorcycle, parties hard and relaxes with his wife and
3-year-old daughter, Clara, at their home in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work in my films and then I go and have a life as well,'' he
says. ``You can make life as complicated as you want and, within
reason, you can make it as simple as you like. I've always just
gone about my business.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most regular blokes' business doesn't involve
battling the minions of evil and wielding The Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my own lightsaber,'' he concedes, ``and that's something
the boys will understand. It felt pretty goddamn good!
</P>
<P>
   ``I got home one day,'' he recalls, ``and my wife and some of
her friends were there. I said, `I acted with R2-D2 today,' and
they all went, `Who? What?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Oh, it's a boy thing. Sorry.'''  &QL;

ALBANY PROSECUTORS STRIKE OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Here's a little story about political life in one
of this country's most intensely political cities:
</P>
<P>
   Ted Williams, the great baseball player, once said he could see
the laces on the ball as it came roaring in at 95 mph. For once, I
know how he felt.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, even I could see how dopey the Albany Police
Department and the Albany County district attorney's office was
going to look on the Rachel McEneny business. I could see the laces
on this ball.
</P>
<P>
   This one wasn't moving at 95 mph, either. This was a slow,
sloppy pitch. The McEnenys smacked it right out of the park.
</P>
<P>
   This all started when state Assemblyman Jack McEneny, whose lust
to serve as mayor has been an open secret in this town for 20 years
now, made a misjudgment two years ago. Faced with a mayor younger
than he is, a guy who showed no signs of retiring or moving on to
another office, McEneny challenged Mayor Jerry Jennings in a
mayoral primary.
</P>
<P>
   Not a smart move. The last time Albany threw out an incumbent
mayor, Teddy Roosevelt was just finding his way around the state
legislative chambers. And that was a unique situation, totally
unrelated to the circumstances of two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   McEneny knew that. He writes books on local history. He just
couldn't resist giving it a shot, was all.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, Jennings rolled over him. Then, in the time-honored
tradition of Albany politics, the mayor set out to assassinate the
guy who'd had the temerity to challenge him. If you're the mayor,
you're more or less obligated to do things like that. Otherwise,
who knows who else might get out of line?
</P>
<P>
   So, the mayor backed County Legislator Gary Domalewicz last year
in a primary challenge against McEneny, who was running to hold on
to his seat in the State Legislature. McEneny won handily.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign manager in both races was his daughter, Rachel, 26.
After last year's win, Rachel McEneny and her boyfriend went to a
bar. She'd had a sip of champagne at headquarters and downed about
a beer and a half at the bar. And, when she left the bar and drove
away, by purest coincidence an Albany cop pulled her over and
charged her with drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, did I mention that the police union had backed Jennings the
year before? Well, they had.
</P>
<P>
   McEneny was dragged back to headquarters, in shackles and in a
paddy wagon. They gave her a breathalyzer test. They said that she
blew a 0.11 percent blood-alcohol content, making her legally
drunk. Then, when her parents sprang her, McEneny went to the
hospital and had a blood alcohol test. It read .04, well within the
legal limit.
</P>
<P>
   Since the human body sheds alcohol at the rate of .02 per hour,
on average, it was obvious that she would be exonerated of this
charge. In fact, some people thought it obvious that this was a
politically motivated frame-up from the start.
</P>
<P>
   I, of course, would never say anything like that. Hey, I can't
read minds. I can't see into people's hearts. I urge you only to
draw your own conclusions from this fact pattern.
</P>
<P>
   The cops and the DA's office, instead of dropping the charges,
insisted on a trial. On Thursday, Rachel McEneny was acquitted,
after Judge John Egan Jr. threw out that highly questionable
breathalyzer test.
</P>
<P>
   And, incidentally, after her lawyer, Steve Coffey, told the jury
that the cop who'd busted her had lied on the stand about her
condition that night. Why the cops and the DA would insist on such
a public humiliation is anybody's guess.
</P>
<P>
   So now will we see a civil lawsuit against the City of Albany
for false arrest?
</P>
<P>
   Well, look closely. You might see the laces on this one, too.

BACKGROUND CHECK: STILL TROUBLESOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
 c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Earlier this year, I wrote a pair of columns looking at the
issue of software that runs in the background, monitoring a
computer for various events, such as viral activity or a software
installation.
</P>
<P>
   In the first column, I wrote that conflicts between background
programs and other software can cause problems on a PC, and
advocated that people run as ``pure'' a system as possible:
(www.chron.com/content/chronicle/tech/99/02/12/compute.html).
</P>
<P>
   In the second, I told how to identify and turn off these
background programs:
(www.chron.com/content/chronicle/tech/99/02/19/compute.html).
</P>
<P>
   I used Norton SystemWorks 1.0 as an example of the type of
package that can cause problems. SystemWorks comes with several
components that run in the background, including Norton AntiVirus,
the Norton Utilities System Doctor, CrashGuard and CleanSweep's
Usage Watch. I reported that running all or even just some of these
components slowed my computer down, and in some cases caused
problems with other applications.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Symantec has introduced a new version of SystemWorks
and its central component. The Norton Utilities SystemWorks 2.0
($70) includes Norton Utilities 4.0, CleanSweep 4.5, Norton
AntiVirus 5.0, CrashGuard 4.0 and Norton Web Services, a help
feature. The package also comes with a bonus pack that includes
Norton 2000, which scans your system for Year 2000 issues; a
``basic'' version of WinFax Pro; Zip-It, a Zip-file manager; and
Visual Page, a Web-authoring program.
</P>
<P>
   CrashGuard, Norton AntiVirus and CleanSweep essentially are the
same programs found in SystemWorks 1.0. But they have been tied
together better with a one-click control panel called the
Integrator. From this single window, you can launch any of the
programs' various components.
</P>
<P>
   The LiveUpdate feature, which lets you download patches and new
virus definitions, also has been integrated, so you need click only
one button to get upgrades for each component.
</P>
<P>
   Norton Utilities has had several new components added, as well
as work done under the hood of some others.
</P>
<P>
   Symantec has added the Connection Doctor, a utility that
troubleshoots modem connections, checking everything from Windows'
settings to the health of the modem. It will tell you what's wrong,
but doesn't necessarily tell you how to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   If you were to run all the Norton SystemWorks background
modules, you'd have as many as six different icons added to the
Windows system tray _ the recessed area to the right of the
taskbar. One new feature is a kind of ``holder'' for all these
icons. There's only one icon in the tray representing all the
Norton pieces. Hold your cursor over it, and the individual icons
appear for quick access to their features.
</P>
<P>
   There have been significant changes made to two very useful
modules that didn't always behave as they should. The System
Doctor, which monitors your PC's status, and ZipRescue, which lets
you make Windows 95/98 system disks on a Zip drive, have both been
reworked internally.
</P>
<P>
   The System Doctor is much less intrusive in the background, and
it conflicted with only one application _ the game Half-Life, which
requires all the attention of your PC to run. I noticed no slowdown
in my PC's performance as a result of running System Doctor, unlike
the previous version.
</P>
<P>
   The initial version of ZipRescue often didn't work at all. It
was supposed to grab a working copy of Windows from your hard drive
and install it on a Zip disk, giving you enough of an operating
system that you could boot from it in a crisis. It didn't work on a
lot of PCs; this new version is much more reliable. It worked on
all three of the systems I tried _ a Dell Dimension, a
Hewlett-Packard Pavilion and a Compaq Presario.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Norton AntiVirus, CleanSweep and CrashGuard still
presented me with problems. Even on a 500-megahertz Pentium III
system, I could tell when the AntiVirus and CleanSweep programs
were running _ they noticeably slowed performance.
</P>
<P>
   And I still found I had more program crashes when running
CrashGuard than I did when it wasn't present _ particularly in Web
browsers.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, I still think the utilities included in this package
are the best Windows 95/98 utilities out there _ so long as you run
most of them manually.

EVEN IF YOU DEFINE YOUR TERMS PRECISELY, YOU CAN'T BE SURE OF CABLE
MODEM SPEED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
 c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Question: Your recently reported on the high-speed Internet
access to be offered by Southwestern Bell and Time Warner
Communications. Speaking of the downsides in both cases, you noted
that cable would slow as more people in the ``neighborhood'' used
it.
</P>
<P>
   But the Warner people said that even the slowest cable would be
far faster than the ADSL phone line. Does ``neighborhood'' refer to
the people on your street or in, say, a subdivision? Or does this
refer to the entire area or town served by a particular cable
station? And when Warner says that slow cable is still far faster
than phone lines, do you know what they mean by ``slow''?
</P>
<P>
   A. The meaning of ``neighborhood'' in this case depends on a
variety of factors, the density of housing being the primary one.
</P>
<P>
   Cable modems work off a node system, where a number of houses
connect to a central point, or node. The cable system is designed
to have a certain number of connections per node.
</P>
<P>
   If you're in a neighborhood where houses are packed closely
together, and a lot of people have cable, you may have multiple
nodes. In large apartment complexes, for example, there typically
are multiple nodes.
</P>
<P>
   But in an area where houses are spaced farther apart, or in
rural areas, there may be fewer nodes.
</P>
<P>
   Warner is saying its cable modems will be capable of an average
speed of around 10 megabits a second and is guaranteeing five
megabits, minimum, even if things bog down. The company promises to
add more nodes in neighborhoods that drop below that.
</P>
<P>
   Five megabits is much faster than a dialup connection at 28.8 to
53 kilobits a second, and also faster than the 1.5 megabits for
residential ADSL from the phone company. On the other hand, in some
communities where cable modems have been widely deployed _ most
notably Fremont, Calif. _ service has been a problem and speeds
have sometimes dropped way below dialup levels.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I would like to bypass the Windows 95 logo screen when I
start my computer. I think I can do this, because I see the screen
twice during bootup, with a glimpse of the DOS prompt in between.
</P>
<P>
   A: To do this, you'll need to use Notepad to edit a file in your
c: folder called MSDOS.SYS. Look for a line that says Logo1 and
change it to change it to Logo0 If you don't see the Logo line, add
it to the end of the file, then save it. You can also use the handy
TweakUI utility to do this, available as part of the PowerToys set
for Windows 95 at 
www.microsoft.com/windows95/downloads/contents/wutoys/w95pwrtoysset/
default.asp.
</P>
<P>
   For Windows 98 users, TweakUI is on the upgrade CD-ROM in the
ToolsReskitPowertoys folder.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have figured out how to clear the history information out
of my browser, but it still leaves information in the toolbar area
for America Online 4.0. How do I clear it that out so prying eyes
don't know where I've been?
</P>
<P>
   A: From the My AOL button, go to Preferences, then click on the
Toolbar button. From there, choose Clear History Now.
</P>
<P>
   How you clear the general history in a Web browser depends on
the software. For Internet Explorer, right-click on the IE icon on
the desktop, choose properties. In IE4 and 5, Clear History is on
the General tab.
</P>
<P>
   In Netscape Communicator, click on Edit, then Preferences, and
it's in the initial Navigator configuration screen.
</P>
<P>
   The TweakUI application, mentioned in another Help Line item
above, also has the ability to clear histories from Internet
Explorer. It also can clear other records, including the documents
listed in the Documents area off the Start menu. To get to this
area, use the Paranoid tab.

FDR'S QUICK ACTION GUIDED AMERICA THROUGH DARK DECADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRED LeBRUN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Franklin Roosevelt was impatient to get started.
There was so much to do.
</P>
<P>
   Across America the lights had been dimming into the darkness of
the Great Depression for at least two years before his election in
November 1932. Barely regulated banks inclined to underwriting wild
speculation were failing at an ever-increasing rate everywhere.
Since 1925, unused and unsold stockpiles of manufacturing
inventories and raw materials were choking warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, more and more businesses were laying off more and
more employees. There was no other work to be found, and
unemployment zoomed.
</P>
<P>
   Since at least the end of World War I, those living on farms
were already in a deeply depressed economy, although their chronic
despair had been largely ignored by a Washington establishment
intent on big business and plain old greed. The Great Depression
began on the farm, not on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a widely believed misconception is that the October 1929
stock market crash ``caused'' the Depression. In truth, only about
2 percent of Americans owned any stock in 1929. The vast majority
of Americans had jobs. When they lost those, and banks failed, they
didn't have anything.
</P>
<P>
   By 1933, America was perilously close to chaos _ and more than
ready to be saved. In perhaps the greatest whirlwind of
presidential activity ever, FDR responded.
</P>
<P>
   FDR was inaugurated on March 4, 1933, and a day later he closed
banks for a week's ``holiday,'' to stop the run on them _ the most
immediate crisis at hand. A week later, the Emergency Banking Act
was passed.
</P>
<P>
   Eight days after taking office, in a daring and unprecedented
move, FDR held the first of his ``fireside chats,'' telling
Americans glued to their crystal sets that it was ``safer to keep
your money in a reopened bank than under the mattress,'' in that
distinctive voice of calm, authority and unflagging optimism that
would get the nation through the darkest decade of American life.
</P>
<P>
   When the banks reopened, the money and gold poured back in.
FDR's appeal had worked magic, as he would again and again.
</P>
<P>
   Within two weeks, FDR and his ``brain trust'' provided
government intervention for agriculture and massive programs aimed
at unemployment relief. Probably the most popular among those
throughout the decade was the CCC _ the Civilian Conservation Corps
_ to this day inspiring fierce loyalty and the fondest memories
from deep conservatives and New Dealers alike.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to employ out-of-work unmarried men from 18 to 25
years of age on forestry, flood control and outdoor beautification
projects. Ultimately the mission expanded to include such tasks as
fighting forest fires, rescuing snowbound livestock and cutting the
Appalachian Trail.
</P>
<P>
   The CCC planted 8 billion trees, built 800 state parks, restored
4,000 historic structures _ among them the Gettysburg Civil War
battlefield _ to name but a very few of its accomplishments. By the
time the CCC dissolved in 1942, when America was at war and needed
foot rather than tree soldiers, 3 million had passed through the
camps. More than 250,000 learned to read and write there. Others
earned high school and college degrees _ education was a
requirement of the contract _ while the majority were given trade
skills.
</P>
<P>
   A regular or reserve Army officer ran each camp, although the
discipline was not as rigorous as Army life. Each camp hired
teachers and doctors, offered religious services and entertainment.
Enrollees, as they were called, were fed well and clothed and
earned a respectable $30 a month, $25 of which had to go back to
the folks.
</P>
<P>
   In many instances, that was money desperately needed back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I quit after my junior year in high school,'' recalled
81-year-old Frank Leonbruno, then of Whitehall, N.Y. ``Things
weren't that good at home. The silk mills closed, the railroads
laid everybody off. I saw the notice in the Whitehall Times, so I
signed up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you, it was great,'' he said. ``Reveille was 6
a.m., and we got up quicklike and put in full days, spraying for
gypsy moths, cutting trails or making campsites. Classes weren't
until after dinner and before lights-out, so we slept well. There
were five barracks at (Camp) Bolton, and 40 men to each barrack.
They were always full.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonbruno became the camp cook. He liked it so much he stayed as
custodian nearly six years, even after the camp broke up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finished high school there. We had a beautiful library. One
of the supervisors took an interest and helped me get a job with
the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonbruno became a New York Department of Environmental
Conservation forest ranger and retired after 42 years as head of
the state's Lake George operation.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lavigna, 86, of Cohoes, N.Y., served in CCC camps in
Michigan, New York and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we didn't do wasn't worth doing,'' Lavigna said.
``Everything. Rescues, built dams, planted trees, took seeds from
cones, even sold cord wood at a dollar a cord, delivered. To this
day, I'm convinced it was one of the best programs that this
country ever had.''

WILL THERE BE LIFE AFTER NEXT EPISODE OF `HOMICIDE'? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It was a little bit of fraud, not rising to the
level of crime (I think), and long before I became a television
critic. In fact, given the same circumstances, I would do it again.
</P>
<P>
   I was a Nielsen cheater.
</P>
<P>
   It was back in 1994. When the Nielsen folks sent the diary in
which my wife and I were supposed to chronicle our television
viewing habits for a week, it was thrown on a coffee table and
temporarily forgotten. Then came the time to submit the diary;
there was a week's worth of blank spaces.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing my wife and I did was mark down watching
``Homicide: Life on the Street,'' which was then airing Thursdays
at 10 p.m. We knew we were out that night, but it didn't matter. We
would have marked down that the whole neighborhood was crammed into
our living room if we thought we could get away with it.
</P>
<P>
   Here was a great show with lousy ratings, and we realized that
we were not going to give it up without making a probably futile
statement.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not a column questioning the accuracy of the
Nielsens (another day, perhaps). Instead, we should talk about a
show that has clung on through artistic success and commercial
failure since its debut after the Super Bowl in January 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homicide'' has hung around, always a favorite more with
critics than the masses, but once again it finds itself on life
support. In less than two weeks the networks will unveil their fall
lineups to advertisers. ``Homicide'' may make the cut, or may get
the ax.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, fans can't have a gripe.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe a dozen shows are ``on the bubble'' to be dropped for next
season (not counting programs voluntarily ending their runs like
``Home Improvement'' and ``Mad About You''). Most deserve to be
dropped _ provided a new show at least as good can be slotted. But
none of the others has the pedigree of ``Homicide'' and its
creator, Tom Fontana, who is also responsible for the even edgier
``Oz'' on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   But while in past years I would have railed against network
hacks if the show was canceled, I would have no beef if
``Homicide'' (Friday nights on NBC) were sent to the morgue. I
wouldn't like it, but you won't see any ``What is NBC thinking?''
harangues.
</P>
<P>
   While I think the gritty _ and there is no more fitting word _
Baltimore cop drama could, and should, go on, you have to
acknowledge that NBC has stuck with the show despite the ratings,
and maybe long enough.
</P>
<P>
   If new NBC entertainment head Scott Sassa was to say that's it,
especially when he notes that viewers will tune in to Friday shows
as evidenced by the dreck that is ``Providence,'' then ``Homicide''
fans will have to concede that television is first a business, and
the show could have been canned four or more years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homicide: Life on the Street'' has had a hit-or-miss season.
The departure of Andre Braugher (Detective Frank Pembleton) was a
creative drain on the show, and focusing on the personal/amorous
pursuits of the squad somewhat derailed the focus.
</P>
<P>
   But when done right, the cop drama can still rank among the best
on television. The May 14 episode, titled ``Lines of Fire,'' proves
it.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Eldard (``ER,'' ``Men Behaving Badly'') guest-stars as a man
who takes his children hostage in an apartment after a falling-out
with his wife over the loss of his job.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Agent Mike Giardello (Giancarlo Esposito) _ the son of Lt.
Al Giardello (Yaphet Kotto) _ emerges as the chief negotiator in
what develops into a taut psychological standoff.
</P>
<P>
   Esposito, who at times struggled to find his niche in the
ensemble show, shines in the spotlight. Eldard's performance is so
good you may be willing to forgive him for ``Men Behaving Badly.''
</P>
<P>
   So, does ``Homicide'' have legs for another year? Sure. But we
can't really complain if NBC knocks those legs out from under it.

MOTHER BECOMES CRUSADER ABOUT DISFIGURING BIRTHMARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, New York, South
Carolina)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LATHAM, N.Y. _ The photos in Linda Rozell Shannon's album
weren't easy to look at.
</P>
<P>
   One image showed Shannon's daughter, her upper lip swollen as if
she'd been punched. Another focused on an infant's deformed cheek,
inflated like a grotesque balloon.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of such disfigurement seemed like unthinkable trauma
or injury, not a fairly common birthmark in children known as a
hemangioma.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pediatrician looked at this every week and said, `It's
just a hemangioma, leave it alone,''' said Shannon, a specialist in
birthmarks and executive director of the Hemangioma and Vascular
Birthmarks Foundation in Latham.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine just looking at this and saying it's going to
go away?'' Over the past four years, Shannon has become a crusader
for more openness about hemangiomas, developing an international
reputation for her work.
</P>
<P>
   Her goal is to encourage physicians to treat disfiguring
birthmarks more aggressively, get insurance companies to cover
related surgery rather than call it cosmetic, and to increase
research into the cause and cure of hemangiomas.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, medical textbooks have taught doctors to let nature
take its course with these red-purple lesions.
</P>
<P>
   Caused by an abnormal distribution of blood vessels under the
skin, hemangiomas are the most common benign tumor in infants,
affecting one in 100 babies with varying severity.
</P>
<P>
   Although many hemangiomas disappear entirely on their own
without any medical intervention, others can take years to go away,
leaving behind disfiguring scars and psychosocial problems.
</P>
<P>
   It's those worst cases that concern Shannon, an author of the
only general book on the topic, ``Birthmarks: a Guide to
Hemangiomas and Vascular Malformations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids have trouble in school, they have trouble
adjusting,'' said Shannon, who works part-time as a research
analyst for the New York Department of Motor Vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon, 43, had never heard of hemangiomas until shortly after
her daughter Christine's birth in February 1994. She didn't think
twice about the tiny red mark that appeared on her baby's bottom
lip, until it began to grow.
</P>
<P>
   By the time her daughter was 18 months old, the tumor was as big
as a golf ball. The family's pediatrician continued to offer only
the vague prognosis that it would eventually go away.
</P>
<P>
   After consulting with specialists in Boston and New York, she
was told her daughter was too old for steroid treatment and too
young for the multiple surgeries needed.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon eventually found Dr. Milton Waner, a plastic surgeon in
Little Rock, Ark. During a three-hour outpatient procedure, he used
a laser to remove her daughter's lesion before reconstructing the
girl's lip.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Christine Shannon, 5, shows few signs of her ordeal. She
is outgoing and has only a tiny scar from her surgery. ``Every
child has a right to look normal and every parent has the right to
a normal looking child or to at least have options,'' Shannon said.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage more aggressive treatment of hemangiomas, Shannon
has helped set up multidisciplinary clinics of dermatologists,
surgeons and pathologists to evaluate and treat children in Atlanta
and Boston; Albany and Buffalo, N.Y.; Arkansas; and, most recently,
in London.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Shannon will travel to South Carolina to work with
doctors there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really on a crusade to offer proper therapy to these
patients,'' said Dr. Martin Mihm, an internationally known
specialist on skin cancer and vascular tumors who has worked with
Shannon to establish some clinics, including one in Tokyo slated to
open next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medical community is very slow to change. The dictum is
that the great majority of these lesions will go away,'' he said.
``The reality is that only 25 percent go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Mihm, director of the newly founded Rare Tumor Institute of the
World Health Organization, credits Shannon for increasing awareness
about vascular birthmarks and treatment options, including
steroids, lasers and surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's really an inspiring example of what a lay person can
do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers don't know what causes hemangiomas, though they tend
to be more common in premature infants. But unlike other
birthmarks, they don't appear until after the baby is born and
then, most often, on the face.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is catching them early,'' said Dr. Edwin Williams,
chief of facial plastic and reconstructive surgery at Albany
Medical Center Hospital and principal surgeon for the Albany
clinic.

WINMODEM IS A LOSERMODEM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I can't use Linux on the Web because I have a
Winmodem, which only works with Windows. Unlike other modem cards
I've seen, this one connects to other cards via small cables. Do
you know if a standard, non-Winmodem card were to replace the
existing one, would it work?
</P>
<P>
   _Linux Wannabe
</P>
<P>
   DEAR WANNABE: Just take the sucker out and see what happens. You
can always put it back later if removing it hammers your system.
I'm guessing you tossed the instruction book like most people, so
this is about the only way to do it unless you can find some
documentation on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   No telling what those wires are for. I've seen some goofy modems
in my time, like the ones that were part sound card. They hooked up
to other stuff. I've seen ones that were built into the motherboard
or relegated to a proprietary slot that grabbed the communications
port you really needed for something else.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, since you have a Winmodem, the real solution is to
take a big wooden mallet and pound it into its component molecules.
These cheesy things use your microprocessor instead of on-board
chips like regular modems do. The software that drives them only
runs under Windows, so if you want to play with DOS or Linux,
you're out of luck.
</P>
<P>
   If it turns out you absolutely need to keep that piece of junk
in your PC to make other stuff work right, there's no law against
having two modems, assuming you have a free slot. Just make sure
you set the new modem's communications port and interrupt to
something different from the Winmodem's. Yes, that means you have
to keep the instruction book this time.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're serious about playing with Linux, avoid Plug and
Play, a Windows abomination that automatically assigns ports and
interrupts. You'll have to set a few jumpers on the modem, but
you'll save yourself a ton of migraines later.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I don't think Bill Gates has a great deal to
fear until the Linux documenters learn to use English instead of
Linux-speak. They are so enamored of their jargon that they make it
next to impossible, even for an experienced user like myself, to
understand what they're saying.
</P>
<P>
   _ Forms Complete Sentences
</P>
<P>
   DEAR FORMS: On the other hand, they probably didn't understand a
single word you wrote. You know how it is: Linux-speak is like the
secret handshake of the geek fraternity. I suppose it makes them
feel special.
</P>
<P>
   Just remember how bad DOS documentation used to be, though. I'm
sure as soon as Linux goes mainstream, all the people running Linux
companies will realize the value of users actually being able to
understand the documentation, and they'll be clamoring for me to
write it for a seven-figure salary. Then I guess all the geeks will
have to make up a new language.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I find your comment ``You know who I'm talking
about: the four-eyed geek in Information Systems who gives
`socially dysfunctional' a whole new spin'' to be absolutly
repulsive! As an IT proffesional I am outraged that you would use
such a discription in a new artical.
</P>
<P>
   _ In a Snit
</P>
<P>
   DEAR SNIT: Gee, I thought a big-time IT ``proffesional'' would
at least know how to use his spell-checker.

GEORGE W. BUSH'S STAND ON EMOTIONAL GUN ISSUE HAS LEFT BOTH SIDES
UNHAPPY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ First the gun control advocates criticized him
for not going far enough. Now many gun rights enthusiasts are
pounding Gov. George W. Bush for going too far in the debate over
instant background checks at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   A national gun rights organization has put out a ``multistate
alert'' on Bush, calling his stand on instant background checks a
``scheme to take away yet more of the rights of law-abiding
owners.''
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail alert from the hard-line Gun Owners Association of
America sparked hundreds of phone calls to Bush's state offices and
presidential campaign headquarters in Austin, Bush officials said.
</P>
<P>
   After the Littleton, Colo., school shooting, the gun control
debate has become a focus of the 2000 presidential race, which Bush
is leading.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's comments about guns have left few happy on either
side of the emotional debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people who I think tend to be one-issue voters are
indicating a great deal of concern over quotes they have read from
some of the (presidential) candidates,'' said Rep. Suzanna Hupp,
R-Lampasas, a gun rights supporter.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Bush was one of them, Hupp said he was.
</P>
<P>
   The other, she said, was Elizabeth Dole, who expressed support
in a recent New Hampshire speech for retaining the ban on assault
weapons and mandatory trigger locks on guns, among other
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Bush supports federal legislation _ though not
state efforts _ to require background checks on people buying
weapons at gun shows, according to Bush and his aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the federal law ought to change to give gun show
operators the ability to conduct instant background checks at gun
shows,'' Bush told reporters this week. ``If instant background are
good enough for gun dealers and storefronts they ought to be good
enough for gun shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he favors a federal approach because the law now says
only federal firearms dealers who have established storefronts must
conduct checks. That law needs to be changed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Dave Beckwith said the governor wants to require
that all sales by gun show vendors be subject to background checks
by making the National Instant Check System available to the gun
show organizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who is a vendor, that is, who has bought a table, or
is setting himself up in business there,'' would be subject to a
background check under Bush's proposal, Beckwith added.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would screen out criminals, you'd screen out minors and
you'd screen out mental patients and others,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over the gun control issue began after reporters
asked Bush to explain his gun control stands in the wake of the
Colorado shooting.
</P>
<P>
   When he expressed support for instant background checks, gun
control advocates criticized him because a state bill that would
require those checks had died in a legislative committee the day
before.
</P>
<P>
   Beckwith said that Bush does not support that now-dead
legislation, and that that's what the campaign has been telling
upset gun enthusiasts who call.
</P>
<P>
   ``He opposed that bill and it died. The Gun Owners of America
know that Governor Bush opposes the legislation and he assured them
it won't pass,'' Beckwith said.
</P>
<P>
   Nina Butts, a lobbyist for Texans Against Gun Violence, said she
was disappointed that Bush did not get behind efforts to pass the
controls on the state level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his heart is in the right place, but I'm very
frustrated that he has not helped us pass a strong gun show law,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Had Bush gotten behind the state legislation, it's still not
clear whether the bill would have passed.
</P>
<P>
   Texas hosts nearly 500 gun shows a year _ twice more than any
other state _ and well-publicized efforts to revive the bill in the
pro-gun Legislature have gone nowhere.

 &HT;    A GENERATION LATER, GERMANY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GENOCIDE
ISSUE
 &HT;    With Photo.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., May 9 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ In the half-century since World War II, Germans have
been taught two maxims: No more war; no more genocide.
</P>
<P>
   With the war in Yugoslavia, these principles are in deep and
unresolved conflict.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since being defeated in World War II, German
forces are engaged in armed military action. An estimated 3,000
German soldiers are in Macedonia as part of a multinational
security force and perhaps as an expeditionary force into Kosovo.
Since the start of the war in late March, 14 Luftwaffe Tornado
warplanes have been flying combat missions over Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Riveted by the images of an estimated 1.5 million Kosovar
Albanian refugees forced from their homes -- images that are
hauntingly reminiscent of Nazi purges of Jews and others -- Germans
support doing something.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the German government has been a leader in bringing
humanitarian aid to Kosovar Albanian refugees in Macedonia, and
taken in nearly 10,000 of them to ease the burden on the cash-poor
Macedonian government. And last week(CQ), German officials were out
front in bringing Russia to the table to narrow its differences
with Western allies over a future international force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, still for many Germans it remains unthinkable that any
efforts should involve force.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls reveal this duality: Most Germans favor NATO
airstrikes, but even more oppose a ground invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we should contribute,'' said Ernest Roeger, 68, a
retired Berlin chemical engineer. ``We could build up hospitals,
refugee camps and help the people build up their country afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we should not take military action,'' Roeger said.
``Because of German history and because Germany has already dropped
bombs on Belgrade, there should be no Germans among the soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   This thinking spans the generations. In Dresden, a city
decimated by Allied bombing near the end of World War II,
15-year-old Melanie Eberle pauses from a sundae at a McDonald's to
profess her horror at the thought of Germans taking up arms.
</P>
<P>
   In her view, the military is an emergency assistance force
rather than a fighting force trained to capture objectives and kill
the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would never be justified for us to go into another country
and start shooting people,'' said Melanie, who is the only one
among her half-dozen friends sitting at the table to express a
willingness to join the military.
</P>
<P>
   Ruprecht Polenz, a senior member of the foreign affairs
committee in the German parliament, said Germans view war
differently from other Europeans and Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Germans have come to equate war and doing wrong as the same
thing,'' he said. ``For other nations, war can connote liberation
or coming to the aid of allies, but for Germans, it means having
done wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany is so bereft of a military culture that there are no
medals to honor war heroes. The traditional Iron Crosses -- a medal
won by Adolf Hitler in the World War I -- were abolished.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for many, the presence of German forces represents evidence
that the country is at last part of the mainstream. ``I don't know
very much about the Luftwaffe, but I am thrilled to see them fly,''
said Gebhardt von Moltke, the German ambassador to Britain, who was
a child during the last war. ``It means we have finally been
forgiven and can have equal rights and responsibilities with the
rest of NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   The belief that Germany is fighting now because of its
obligation to NATO as opposed to some national aspiration or
interest seems to ease the concerns of many. ``We're an integral
part of NATO,'' said Matthius Griebel, the director of the Dresden
city museum and a survivor of the 1945 fire-bombing. ``When we have
benefitted from NATO security then we must also take part in an
action such as this.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, other Germans remain deeply opposed to the war.
</P>
<P>
   Ilona Rothe of Berlin has formed a group called Mothers Against
the War. She says she has received more than 1,000 phone calls from
people who agree with her assertion that the war must be stopped
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have touched a nerve in Germany,'' she said. ``I hear the
women crying on the telephone for their sons or their husbands.''
</P>
<P>
   Her 24-year-old son is among the German troops in Macedonia --
where they have built and operate the best of all the refugee camps
there. So far, Rothe's son has seen no action. ``I heard an
interview with a Serbian mother, in which she said, 'I want my son,
I don't care about (Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic.' That's
how I feel,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   German Chancellor Gerhardt Schroeder(CQ), the first German
leader with no personal experience with World War II, acknowledged
the dilemma in a recent magazine interview. But he argued that this
generation of Germans must not be in the position of trying to
explain to later ones why they did nothing to respond to the plight
of the Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to be able to say: We did what was possible and
right,'' Schroeder told Der Spiegel. ``Especially as Germans, our
response must be clear: We must never again allow murder,
expulsions and deportations to be tolerated.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _Itzik Sudri's vision of Israel is different from the
one most Americans imagine from afar.
</P>
<P>
   For Sudri, a spokesman for the ultra-religious Shas Party,
Israel is not the mythic Zionist refuge, where pioneers band
together for common survival.
</P>
<P>
   He sees what is often called the ``tribal'' Israel. In that
Israeli reality, Shas and their supporters, the ``Sephardim'' of
Asian and North African descent, battle daily against the
``Ashkenazim'' elites from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to start from the assumption that there's a culture
war in the country,'' Sudri says. ``In the last 15 years, Shas has
been destroying everything (the elites) have tried to create . . .
what we're doing frightens every secular Ashkenazi.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the May 17 elections for parliament and prime minister are
intensifying Israel's battles between the tribes. Tribes that seem
to be growing farther apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are remarkably similar to each other compared to
Israelis,'' says Michael Walzer, who studies Israel for the
Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, N.J. ``Among the
(countries) I know, Israel is the most polarized.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel's current divisions are no surprise. The country was born
only 50 years ago. It has since been rapidly populated by
immigrants speaking different languages, socialist ideologues
fighting for liberation and ultra-religious Jews seeking biblical
land.
</P>
<P>
   Shas and the other Sephardim, olive-skinned and usually working
class, clash with the fair-haired and wealthier Askenazim.
Ultra-Religious Jews in black suits and fedoras attack secular Jews
in tie-dye. The growing Russian and Arab minorities cluster in
their own ethnic parties seeking influence as tie-breakers among
the bigger players.
</P>
<P>
   The population of 6 million is changing. Religious Jews and
Arabs have large families, so their numbers increase. A million
Soviet immigrants have arrived since 1989. And, Israelis are what
one pollster calls, ``calcified voters.'' Repeatedly, Sephardim and
the religious Jews back right-wingers, while Ashkenazim, secular
Jews and Arabs back left-wingers.
</P>
<P>
   They battle daily in the press, politics and sometimes the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each group thinks they only have to worry about themselves.
Extremism is growing,'' said Orthodox Rabbi Yehuda Gilad, leader of
a small mixed party of religious and secular leaders. ``I think the
majority is sick of this trend.''
</P>
<P>
   But, moderation does not look likely.
</P>
<P>
   The Center Party, formed to bridge cultural and political gaps,
is floundering. Extreme religious parties are flexing their muscle
with street protests. The small, combative Change Party benefits
from the backlash by attacking the religious, their military
exemptions and their use of government money for their schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we were defending the state, somebody stole it from
behind our backs,'' says Change candidate Tommy Lapid.
</P>
<P>
   The major candidates for prime minister, right-wing incumbent
Benjamin Netanyahu and left-wing Labor Party challenger Ehud Barak,
are tuning their appeals to ethnic ears. Sometimes they try to
remind people of the common good, sometimes not.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has publicly apologized for historic mistreatment of the
Sephardim by his Ashkenazim. Both parties run campaign ads with
Russian subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   But, this week, a comedian at a Labor Party rally made fun of
the Sephardim -- calling them ``rabble'' -- and Netanyahu's Likud
Party turned it into a campaign commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu later toured a produce market, reportedly saying,
``these so-called elites, they hate the people. They hate
Sephardim.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sephardim make up about 35 percent of the voters -- more
than the Ashkenazim -- and the parliamentary system increases their
clout.
</P>
<P>
   Since only a majority of parliament can recall a prime minister,
any leader has to build a coalition of several small parties to
stay afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Amid it all, the country's major issue, relations with it's Arab
neighbors, can be decided almost as a by-product of the tribal
competition.
</P>
<P>
   A prime minister can either find himself hostage to the many
demands of small parties or exploit the competition between them to
steer the country toward solutions with the Arabs -- something most
Israelis support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you a lot of leverage,'' said Israeli political
scientist Shmuel(cq) Sandler. ``You can buy them off.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Shas wants more government money for religious
schools and Shas welfare services. The peace process is less
important.
</P>
<P>
   When left-winger Yitzhak Rabin agreed to their demands, they
joined his coalition and helped him ratify the historic Oslo Peace
Accords. In 1996, when Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to their demands,
they bolstered his coalition and helped him bring the Oslo process
to a tense standstill.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Shas finds new competition from other ethnic parties.
</P>
<P>
   The main Russian party is running commercials in Russian
exhorting voters to give it more parliamentary seats than Shas.
</P>
<P>
   With that clout, the ad promises, it will be able to force the
next prime minister to remove the Shas leadership of the
immigration ministry and install a secular Russian in the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is going to give (the ministry) to us just as a
gesture,'' says Natan Sharansky, leader of the party.
</P>
<P>
   In return for its demands, the Russians would set aside their
hawkish views on the peace process. They backed the dovish Rabin in
1992. Seeking a better deal, they flipped and backed the hawkish
Netanyahu in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But, prime ministers can also find themselves at what many call
the ``blackmail'' of the tribes.
</P>
<P>
   The religious parties, for example, threatened to bring down
Netanyahu's government if he backed proposals to recognize the less
traditional Reform and Conservative forms of Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's predicament is summed up artfully by an animated
political commercial for the left-wing Meretz Party.
</P>
<P>
   It shows an exhausted Netanyahu dancing to a caricature
``Klezmer'' band of notable religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the tribes choose the music and the prime
minister dances.
</P>
<P>
   Even Netanyahu supporters found it amusing. But, given the tense
political climate and Israel's tribal voting habits, few will
change their vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least it brought a smile to people's faces,'' said Meretz
parliamentarian Nomi Chazan. ``That's something.''

   JERUSALEM _ The May 17 elections for Israeli prime minister, and
the possible June 1 run-off, are expected to be split along ethnic
and religious lines. That's how elections have long been decided in
what many call Israel's ``tribal'' society.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, Jews of European descent, Arabs and secular voters
prefer the left-wing Labor Party while Russian immigrants, Jews of
North African and Asian descent, and religious voters back
right-wing Likud.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at ethnic voting patterns based on research on the
1996 election when the Likud Party's Benjamin Netanyahu narrowly
beat the Labor Party's Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
   ETHNIC GROUPS:
</P>
<P>
   Group: Jews of recent African and Asian descent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _Itzik Sudri's vision of Israel is different from the
one most Americans imagine from afar.
</P>
<P>
   For Sudri, a spokesman for the ultra-religious Shas Party,
Israel is not the mythic Zionist refuge, where pioneers band
together for common survival.
</P>
<P>
   He sees what is often called the ``tribal'' Israel. In that
Israeli reality, Shas and their supporters, the ``Sephardim'' of
Asian and North African descent, battle daily against the
``Ashkenazim'' elites from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to start from the assumption that there's a culture
war in the country,'' Sudri says. ``In the last 15 years, Shas has
been destroying everything (the elites) have tried to create . . .
what we're doing frightens every secular Ashkenazi.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the May 17 elections for parliament and prime minister are
intensifying Israel's battles between the tribes. Tribes that seem
to be growing farther apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are remarkably similar to each other compared to
Israelis,'' says Michael Walzer, who studies Israel for the
Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, N.J. ``Among the
(countries) I know, Israel is the most polarized.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel's current divisions are no surprise. The country was born
only 50 years ago. It has since been rapidly populated by
immigrants speaking different languages, socialist ideologues
fighting for liberation and ultra-religious Jews seeking biblical
land.
</P>
<P>
   Shas and the other Sephardim, olive-skinned and usually working
class, clash with the fair-haired and wealthier Askenazim.
Ultra-Religious Jews in black suits and fedoras attack secular Jews
in tie-dye. The growing Russian and Arab minorities cluster in
their own ethnic parties seeking influence as tie-breakers among
the bigger players.
</P>
<P>
   The population of 6 million is changing. Religious Jews and
Arabs have large families, so their numbers increase. A million
Soviet immigrants have arrived since 1989. And, Israelis are what
one pollster calls, ``calcified voters.'' Repeatedly, Sephardim and
the religious Jews back right-wingers, while Ashkenazim, secular
Jews and Arabs back left-wingers.
</P>
<P>
   They battle daily in the press, politics and sometimes the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each group thinks they only have to worry about themselves.
Extremism is growing,'' said Orthodox Rabbi Yehuda Gilad, leader of
a small mixed party of religious and secular leaders. ``I think the
majority is sick of this trend.''
</P>
<P>
   But, moderation does not look likely.
</P>
<P>
   The Center Party, formed to bridge cultural and political gaps,
is floundering. Extreme religious parties are flexing their muscle
with street protests. The small, combative Change Party benefits
from the backlash by attacking the religious, their military
exemptions and their use of government money for their schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we were defending the state, somebody stole it from
behind our backs,'' says Change candidate Tommy Lapid.
</P>
<P>
   The major candidates for prime minister, right-wing incumbent
Benjamin Netanyahu and left-wing Labor Party challenger Ehud Barak,
are tuning their appeals to ethnic ears. Sometimes they try to
remind people of the common good, sometimes not.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has publicly apologized for historic mistreatment of the
Sephardim by his Ashkenazim. Both parties run campaign ads with
Russian subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   But, this week, a comedian at a Labor Party rally made fun of
the Sephardim -- calling them ``rabble'' -- and Netanyahu's Likud
Party turned it into a campaign commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu later toured a produce market, reportedly saying,
``these so-called elites, they hate the people. They hate
Sephardim.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sephardim make up about 35 percent of the voters -- more
than the Ashkenazim -- and the parliamentary system increases their
clout.
</P>
<P>
   Since only a majority of parliament can recall a prime minister,
any leader has to build a coalition of several small parties to
stay afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Amid it all, the country's major issue, relations with it's Arab
neighbors, can be decided almost as a by-product of the tribal
competition.
</P>
<P>
   A prime minister can either find himself hostage to the many
demands of small parties or exploit the competition between them to
steer the country toward solutions with the Arabs -- something most
Israelis support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you a lot of leverage,'' said Israeli political
scientist Shmuel(cq) Sandler. ``You can buy them off.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Shas wants more government money for religious
schools and Shas welfare services. The peace process is less
important.
</P>
<P>
   When left-winger Yitzhak Rabin agreed to their demands, they
joined his coalition and helped him ratify the historic Oslo Peace
Accords. In 1996, when Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to their demands,
they bolstered his coalition and helped him bring the Oslo process
to a tense standstill.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Shas finds new competition from other ethnic parties.
</P>
<P>
   The main Russian party is running commercials in Russian
exhorting voters to give it more parliamentary seats than Shas.
</P>
<P>
   With that clout, the ad promises, it will be able to force the
next prime minister to remove the Shas leadership of the
immigration ministry and install a secular Russian in the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is going to give (the ministry) to us just as a
gesture,'' says Natan Sharansky, leader of the party.
</P>
<P>
   In return for its demands, the Russians would set aside their
hawkish views on the peace process. They backed the dovish Rabin in
1992. Seeking a better deal, they flipped and backed the hawkish
Netanyahu in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But, prime ministers can also find themselves at what many call
the ``blackmail'' of the tribes.
</P>
<P>
   The religious parties, for example, threatened to bring down
Netanyahu's government if he backed proposals to recognize the less
traditional Reform and Conservative forms of Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's predicament is summed up artfully by an animated
political commercial for the left-wing Meretz Party.
</P>
<P>
   It shows an exhausted Netanyahu dancing to a caricature
``Klezmer'' band of notable religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the tribes choose the music and the prime
minister dances.
</P>
<P>
   Even Netanyahu supporters found it amusing. But, given the tense
political climate and Israel's tribal voting habits, few will
change their vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least it brought a smile to people's faces,'' said Meretz
parliamentarian Nomi Chazan. ``That's something.''

   Q. My husband and I are both 44 and I am concerned about the
allotment of our portfolio. I work part time and have a 401(k) plan
through my employer. I contribute $120 a month, which is 5 percent
of my salary, and my employer contributes 3 percent. This goes in
equal amounts to SSGA Growth and Income fund, where I now have
$6,300, and SSGA Small Cap fund, where the balance is $6,000. We
have these mutual fund IRA accounts: $11,800 in Fidelity Puritan,
$20,700 in Fidelity Contrafund, $$10,500 in Fidelity Convertible
Securities, and $35.000 in Fidelity Asset Manager. My husband works
for the local government, and can expect a pension representing 80
percent of his average salary for the last three years he works.
What do you estimate our present holdings will be worth at age 60?
Would you suggest any changes?
</P>
<P>
   J.J., Norwood, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, the math is the easy part: If you simply left the
401(k) and IRA portfolios alone and they produced average annual
returns of 10 percent for 16 years, your retirement savings would
grow to $418,142. If you continued your contributions of $120 a
month and your employer added a further $72 each month, the account
would grow to $504,745. And if you maintain your contributions as a
percentage of salary, the contributions and likely accumulation
would rise every time during the next 16 years that you get a
raise.
</P>
<P>
   Would I recommend changes? Maybe. It seems to me that three of
your holdings, including the largest, are pretty conservative for a
person 16 years away from retirement. Fidelity Asset Manager and
Puritan both maintain 35 to 40 percent of their portfolios on the
fixed-income side of the ledger, and while Fidelity Convertible
Securities has produced solid results, by its nature it is unlikely
to outperform traditional stock funds over the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   But before you rush out to make changes, there's also the
question of whether you are comfortable with this fairly
conservative portfolio and would be uncomfortable with a higher
risk profile. No portfolio can be right for all investors, and if
what you now hold reflects your appetite for risk, by all means
stick with it. And I've found over the years that when a portfolio
has been built along fairly conservative lines, it's because the
owner knows his or her own risk tolerence better than I ever can.
</P>
<P>
   That said, if it were my portfolio and I were 44, I'd reduce the
Asset Manager position sharply, putting about $10,000 in Fidelity
Select Health Care and another $10,000 in Fidelity Spartan Market
Index, a fund which tracks the results of the Standard and Poor's
500 index. I probably would stick with Convertible Securities for
the short term, based on my distrust of the current market, but
when the market seemed neutral to me, I would transfer that money
to either Contrafund or Market Index.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, while dividing your contributions evenly between the
SSGA Growth and Income and Small-Cap funds is fine at this point,
you'll want to watch those accounts over the years, since you
should want the small-cap holding to eventually represent some 10
to 15 percent of the total portfolio (including the IRAs) wheras
the Growth and Income account can be combined with your other
large-cap positions (Contrafund and the stock sides of the Puritan
and Asset Manager portfolios) to comprise your core position, which
might run as high as 60 percent of the portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Now that Vanguard's Health Care fund is closed to new
investors, could you recommend another in the sector? Both Fidelity
Select Health Care and Putnam's Health Sciences charge loads. Would
you invest in these funds anyway? These are the only three health
care sector funds I can find.
</P>
<P>
   P.H., South Boston
</P>
<P>
   A. My instinct would be to pay the small load _ 3 percent _ and
go into Fidelity Select Health Care. But if you insist on finding a
no-load fund in the sector, consider Invesco Health Sciences, which
also wins the highest grades from Morningstar Mutual Funds and
charges only a 12b-1 fee.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the sector which are followed by Morningstar and worth
considering are AIM Global Health Care, Eaton Vance Worldwide
Health, Franklin Global Health Care, MSDW Health Sciences, Warburg
Pincus Health Sciences, and H&AMP;O Healthcare Investors.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In a previous column you said proceeds of a home sale could
be used to establish up to $2,000 in IRA accounts each year.
Doesn't an IRA account have to be funded with earned income?
</P>
<P>
   R.T., Haverhill, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The rule establishes that the individual opening an IRA
account must have earned income representing at least the amount
that is put into the IRA _ but the money need not come directly
from the earned income. In fact, a number of parents have written
to me proposing to fund their working children's IRAs as a form of
a gift _ and it's perfectly all right, so long as the children's
earnings exceed the amount that goes into the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Please help my children, ages 13 and 15, invest what they
call their _ life savings. Each has about $2,500. I would like to
see the money invested in a fund which would be profitable for them
and would prove interesting to them, so they could learn how to
invest and save. I will assume that the money will be used for
their education in the near future, or for a car for work. What
fund would be best?
</P>
<P>
   J.M., Ortonville, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   A. Alas, I think all they can learn at this stage is that the
first rule of investing, which is to match the duration of the
investment with the time frame in which the money is likely to be
used. It sounds to me from what you say that the older child is
likely to tap into this money in about two years, and the younger
in four. Either way, that's short-term money, and so your
investment should match.
</P>
<P>
   At the most venturesome, I'd look at a fund such as the
Fidelity's or Vanguard's Short-Term Bond funds, which are pretty
far from the kind of things which generate a lot of excitement. But
they will give the kids an idea of how mutual fund investments
work, and the chances are strong that over the next two to four
years they will generate a slightly better total return than if you
left the money in the bank, bought CDs, or put it in a mutual fund
company's money market fund.

HEATING, COOLING AN ENCLOSED PORCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 9, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I enclosed my 10- by 12-foot porch, with virtually 100
percent windows on three sides, and am wondering how I can best
heat and air-condition it. Would those windows make it difficult to
heat and cool? It faces west.
</P>
<P>
   R.S., Brockton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The fact that it faces west means that at least one side (the
south side) gets sun for at least half a day, and the west side
gets sun (albeit a setting sun) for part of the day. That should be
good in winter, but tough in summer, making a/c more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The small size of the room will make it all possible. If you
cannot extend the cool from the house, I suggest a window a/c would
work.
</P>
<P>
   As for heat, you could buy a power-vented gas stove, the type
that doesn't need a chimney and shows the dancing flames. It looks
good, and turns on with the flip of a switch. The smallest such
stove will heat the room in minutes. Such a stove costs about
$1,000. Another option is to buy a power-vented pellet stove. You
could also adapt the stove to burn propane gas, but the bottled gas
is very expensive. Energy companies sell both, plus accessories.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can I clean my wide pine floor boards that have been
stained and oiled? The sander said he can't sand them any more
because some are tongued and grooved.
</P>
<P>
   SALLY KITTROSS, Acton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The reason tongued-and-grooved boards cannot be sanded is
because there is only 1/4 inch of sandable wood surfaces, as
opposed to a full inch or 3/4 inch of sandable surface of
square-edged boards. That 1/4 inch probably cannot be sanded more
than three tmes, and you must have reached the limit.
</P>
<P>
   And, alas, an oiled finish cannot be cleaned except by dry
mopping or vacuuming.
</P>
<P>
   But hope springs eternal, and you can try this: Hand sand to
remove the dirt, which has been ground into the wood. If that
works, you will probably restain the entire floor; then apply two
coats of an oil-based polyurethane varnish over the oiled finish;
the longer the oil has been on and in the wood, the better the
varnishing will work.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Two years ago I bought Sears exterior latex paint, and
recently painted ceilings with it. It smelled skunkish, and the
stench is still there. How can I remove or cover that odor?
</P>
<P>
   GENE SAVAGE, Hopkinton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. That is one of the reasons that exterior paint should not be
used indoors, but you already know that. Other reasons for the
taboo is that exterior paint is heavy, and would be more likely to
pull itself off a ceiling than regular ceiling paint; exterior
paints may exude more fumes than interior paints; and exterior
paints take longer to cure than interior paints.
</P>
<P>
   Try covering the odor by applying a latex enamel undercoater or
BIN, a shellac-based white primer. Then you can apply a white latex
ceiling paint (it's by definition interior).
</P>
<P>
   The only reason there is a taboo against interior paints
outdoors is that they simply do not stand up outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have three layers of wallpaper to remove from a room. I
used a paper tiger to score it so the steamer will soften the
paste, but I find that the steamer produces too much water, and it
is difficult to take the paper off when it is sprayed by hot water.
Is there an additive I can put in the water to make it easier?
</P>
<P>
   JOE NORMANDY, Andover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. There are many additives to make the stripper water wetter,
keeping it on the paper longer so it can do its work. They might
help, but I have found that getting the water almost boiling, then
applying it with a roller is most effective and uses very little
water.
</P>
<P>
   A steamer will provide heat with a minimum of water; your
steamer might not be creating enough steam. And, to prevent excess
water from hitting the floor and/or baseboards, tape a light
plastic tarp on the wall just above the baseboard and cascading
over the floor.
</P>
<P>
   I never used a tarp, because I was going to sand and finish the
floors anyway. It was amazing how much paper that I took off and
pasted right on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a small dilemma; I can't find filters for my oil-fired
hot air furnace. They are an odd size, 18 by 20 inches. Any ideas?
</P>
<P>
   HOWARD KATZ, Boston
</P>
<P>
   A. That is a dilemma, and I don't think 18 by 20 inches is an
odd size, unless someone cut a larger filter to fit your furnace.
Some permanent filters (the kind you can wash when they get dirty)
can be cut with scissors. The other type, with a cardboard border,
cannot be trimmed practically.
</P>
<P>
   So, check your filter; if it does not have a border, it is a
permanent one and can be washed _ and trimmed. Also, check your oil
dealer; he should know, or carry them. Or, call the manufacturer to
find out what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   If your filters have the cardboard border, you can clean them a
little by whacking them against a hard surface, just to remove some
of the dust and dirt.

KEEP THE HEAT ON MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What may be the beginning of the end of the NATO's Balkan air
war brings the Russians back under the West's tent, totally
isolates the Serb menace, Mr. Milosevic, and sets out on the
diplomatic table a solution that is acceptable, if not ideal.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, Slobodan would be Slobo-gone after a stray piece of
NATO ordnance found him during a night raid; that would be justice
in action. But the Group of Eight agreement announced Thursday
achieves the NATO objectives and fences off the Serb threat,
quarantining the rabid Serb chief in his own lair.
</P>
<P>
   Till he knuckles under and pulls his military machine out of
Kosovo, NATO should hammer him day and night. The blowing up of
petroleum supplies, after the reduction of power plants and the
knockdown of bridges and rail connections, imposes a frightening
price on his resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, his marauders forced more than half the Kosovars out of
their territory, and no, NATO was unable to really get at the Serb
ground forces and artillery that did most of the damage. In that
sense, Milosevic has achieved more of his infernal objectives than
NATO's hurried rush to prevent more massacres.
</P>
<P>
   But the character of modern Balkan politics is irretrievably
altered. Milosevic is a war criminal in search of indictment. Like
Chile's Pinochet, he'll be at risk of arrest, imprisonment and
trial if he ever leaves Serb territory. He and many of his thugs
will be identified, labeled, and their pictures will be on post
office walls all over Europe. Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide,
these men have no future in the civilized world.
</P>
<P>
   To an extent unimagined by Bill Clinton's many enemies at home,
the White House has managed one of the astonishing balancing acts
of modern warfare. With US forces in the lead, mounting 15,000 air
sorties, 5,000 of them combat strikes, with all sorts of missiles
and bombs and guns filling the often-murky skies over Serb
territory, enough damage was wrought to bring the Serb assault to
the brink of extinction.
</P>
<P>
   All of this took place, at least up till Thursday afternoon,
without any NATO combat casualties. Two planes were downed, three
soldiers captured, but both pilots were rescued, and the three
soldiers were sprung. True, there were the two regrettable deaths
in a training mission of the Apache helicopter crew.
</P>
<P>
   But to manage such a complex and vast military operation, with
fighting forces of 16 nations in place, without any more losses
than these, and the political coalition still intact, is
remarkable. A week ago the West was rattled by Kremlin bluster,
talk of World War III, and a Slav alliance rallying behind
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The White House cajoled the Yeltsin government back under the
tent. Russia needs its IMF and World Bank infusions, the Serbs have
made hardly a dent in the resolve of Western governments to see the
bombing campaign through, and the much-trumpeted second-guessing
and misgivings about how the war was waged seem less impressive
now. Alas, we may have to put up with the Milosevic regime. He'll
join the nose-thumbers in Iraq, Libya, and Cuba, dictators rattling
diminished cages, cowing their own people.
</P>
<P>
   But one can hope that the NATO chiefs keep up the pressure,
unrolling the B-52s and all they can carry, till Milosevic is truly
back in his cage. That may only be a matter of days. It's hard to
envisage Milosevic staying defiant with the Russians on record as
favoring the G-8 deal.
</P>
<P>
   What will the peacekeepers _ I prefer the term
``peace-enforcers'' _ find when they roll into Kosovo? Blood-soaked
soil. Hastily-buried bodies. Raped womenfolk. Traumatized children.
Wasted crops. Slain livestock. Burned houses. Destroyed
infrastructure. Broken families. Desperate needs for housing, a
reliable food supply, medical, and psychiatric care.
</P>
<P>
   We already have the testimony of tens of thousands of victims as
to the ferocity and extent of Serbian war crimes. Milosevic's
forces swept through the southeast corner of Europe like the Nazis,
Goths and Vandals before them.
</P>
<P>
   What's different now from the days when Western diplomats
deliberated endlessly with Slobodan the Slaughterer over his
depradations in Bosnia is that there are no more illusions about
the Serb chief. He's not to be trusted; he must be trussed up.
</P>
<P>
   There are lessons we learned closer to home. Where was the
``Never Again!'' chorus when the refugees by the hundreds of
thousands were driven from Kosovo at bayonet-point? What did we
hear most, in the Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave? Don't
fight, don't bomb, don't join 18 other NATO allies, cried many.
It's too dangerous, mysterious, uncertain and treacherous. You know
those Balkan peoples, they're always at each other's throats, let
them kill each other, it's not our fight. That sentiment slopped
over the Congress too, and quenched the fighting spirit of our
Quisling Quongress .
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will slaughter Milosevic in the PR war to come. The
president pointed to a woman refugee wearing an Olympic T-shirt.
``I could imagine that any of you could be my neighbors in
America,'' cooed the president whose bedside manner infuriates his
Republican enemies.
</P>
<P>
   A young woman from Pristina told Clinton: ``You understood us
and you understood our pain. And even if we die, the dying would be
easier because we know that somebody knows what we're going
through.'' Clinton told the refugees to forego becoming embittered.
``I ask you not to give them that victory,'' the president said.
``Don't let yourself be broken by this.'' Vintage Clinton. Bill
pulls it off yet again.

JONATHA BROOKE'S INDEPENDENCE DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine you're a major label recording artist on a national tour
to support a new album. The single is just beginning to move on the
radio. You're selling out theaters. A month into the tour your
record company calls to inform you that your option is coming up.
They ask you to take a giant cut in budget for your next project.
You _ who are more concerned with promoting your current record and
are frankly inclined to defer this final judgment of your worth _
ask for a six-month extension on the option. You wait for word.
They never call back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deadline for the option came and went. There was no phone
call. No nothing,'' says Boston-bred singer-songwriter Jonatha
Brooke, who was unceremoniously dropped by her label, MCA, in March
of last year. So Brooke did what any levelheaded, recently rejected
girl would do: She threw a dinner party and invited all her friends
who'd been dumped. ``Wendy and Lisa were there. Me'Shell
Ndegeocello, all my friends who had been dropped from labels,''
recalls Brooke, on the phone from a hotel in Albany, N.Y. ``It was
like, `I've been dropped three times.' And someone would say,
`That's nothing. I've been dropped four times.' It became a
celebration. We figured we all must be so good,'' she says,
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to suggest that Brooke didn't take an emotional
nosedive as well. ``It was an incredible blow, to be in the middle
of a national tour and suddenly be label-less again. And I couldn't
believe it had happened to this record in particular. I was so in
love with `10(CT) Wings,' '' she says of her 1997 album for MCA.
``It broke my heart.'' But Brooke persevered, went back out on the
road using her own means, and the tour wound up being supplying her
with the reassurance she needed to pick herself up by her
bootstraps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beautiful thing about the situation was that I realized
nothing had really changed. I was selling out concerts. I was
intact. My career was intact. MCA had nothing to do with that.''
Last summer Brooke created her own label, Bad Dog Records, and
released ``Jonatha Brooke Live,'' a collection of 10 tracks
recorded during the 1998 spring tour _ about half of them in Boston
at a WXRV-FM (92.5) concert at City Hall Plaza and at the
Somerville Theatre. It includes material from Brooke's early days
in the Boston-based duo the Story (with Jennifer Kimball) as well
as songs from her two solo albums.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started listening back to those shows last summer, the
live thing had this energy. It was an intenseness and sparseness,
with everything centering around the performance.''
</P>
<P>
   No longer supported by the corporate machinery, Brooke released
the album through her Internet Web site (www.jonathabrooke.com), an
experience she says was initially daunting for a self-described
``computer spastic,'' but ultimately fruitful. ``We've sold 3,500
records over the Internet. It was a great way to get it out there,
to get things started and see what the vibe was, and then come out
with a commercial release.'' Koch International, an independent
company that also distributes indie-queen Ani DiFranco's records,
has put ``Jonatha Brooke Live'' in retail stores nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Brooke moved from Boston to a hillside cottage in the Brentwood
section of Los Angeles several years ago. ``I'd been here a long,
long time,'' says Brooke, the daughter of a journalist father and
poet mother who grew up in Weston and the Back Bay. She says Boston
was a great place to cut her acoustic chops, but that ``I wasn't
really being supported or challenged. Although that was probably in
my own mind. I had all these musician friends in LA. And it seemed
like it would be a good place to be heard, you know, to be in close
proximity to my record label. That worked out really well, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   Brooke has learned, however, that neither location nor label has
much to do with the creative aspect of making music, ``which is
hell either way. You'd think that after 10 years it would be no
problem. But it's a strange masochistic process for me, this
incredible wrangling with the muse.'' Indeed, Brooke's songs _
finely cut, exquisitely wrought folk-pop gems that are as precise
in melody and tone as they are elliptical in their poetic
excavation of relationships _ sound as if they've been wrenched
from deep inside, painstakingly sculpted and sanded, and finally
polished to a glow.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few are gifts,'' Brooke concedes. ``They plop in your lap.
But mostly it's this game of hide-and-seek. It's like a very
superstitious ritual. I have notebooks full of ideas. Bits and
pieces that I'm working on. And you have to chain yourself to the
table to find out which page fits with which melody. Plus I'm such
a brutal, brutal critic of my own work, it's amazing that anything
gets through.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooke's music is complex, spare but remarkably sophisticated,
and just plain better than much of the singer-songwriter fare
that's out there. Asked if she feels she hasn't received her due
respect or success, especially in light of the current wave of
chart-topping female artists, Brooke is circumspect. ``I think it's
more that people haven't had a chance to hear me, that all these
opportunities just haven't worked out. We were just starting to
chart when MCA dropped me. I don't know . . . maybe it's good to
build a career this slowly and steadily.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the false starts and dashed hopes, Brooke has a sure
sense of herself and her music. As to whether she'll try to jump
back in the game, Brooke says she's of two minds. ``I do appreciate
what the major label can do for you, if you're the lucky girl who
wins the lottery and gets a person who sticks behind you. I haven't
had that luxury. And it would probably take a lot to convince me to
go back. But I will go ahead and record the next studio project. I
don't have $200,000. But I'm liking the sparse, visceral sound,''
Brooke says. ``And I wouldn't necessarily have known that if things
hadn't happened this way.''

BURNSIDE UPDATES HIS MISSISSIPPI BLUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The blues never sounded like this before. Take three hip-hop
DJs, including Beck's mix-master genius, Tom Rothrock, and have
them rework the music of Mississippi hill-country bluesman R. L.
Burnside. The results are revelatory on Burnside's latest disc,
``Come On In,'' a techno-blues breakthrough that is one of the
best-selling blues records in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I was going to like it, but man, it came back
good,'' says Burnside, a 71-year-old golden ager whose deep
brawling voice and cutting slide guitar have been modernized but
not bastardized by the remixers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never done nothing like that, you know? But the people
like it and it's selling good, and that's the main thing,'' says
Burnside. These will be stripped-down, juke-joint affairs _ don't
expect any sampled hip-hop beats _ but ``we might decide to jam''
on some of the songs from ``Come On In,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Burnside, who was rediscovered in 1992 in the documentary film
``Deep Blues'' and later recorded with the Jon Spencer Blues
Explosion, has also made history by being the only blues act
distributed by the punk-oriented Epitaph Records. Usual Epitaph
clients include the Offspring and Rancid, so you get the picture.
Burnside's home label remains Fat Possum Records _ a label beloved
by blues connoisseurs _ but Epitaph is thrilled with its
partnership with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``R. L.'s album has definitely hit a nerve with a different
crowd,'' Epitaph spokeswoman Kathie Koehler says. ``It has sold
50,000 copies _ and many have been bought by young people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seeing a lot of young faces at our concerts now,'' adds
Burnside, whose touring group features his grandson, Cedric, on
drums. ``Young people are just now beginning to realize that all
the music started from the blues.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnside is one of the last living masters. He learned from
guitar great Fred McDowell (a neighbor) and Muddy Waters, who
married his first cousin, Anna Mae. ``I heard Muddy's music in the
'40s when I went up to Chicago to live with my father for a
while,'' says Burnside. ``I'd go to his house about every other
night to listen to him play. I loved his music.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the ``Deep Blues'' movie, Burnside has toured eight months
annually, at a time when other bluesmen his age are winding down.
``If the Lord will bless me, I'll do it for a few more years,''
says Burnside.

   Getting Staind: It's been an uphill climb, but the Springfield,
Mass.-based Staind has joined Godsmack as Bay State metal-rockers
with a national profile. The band toiled for years just trying to
break into the Boston market through such clubs as the Rat, Mama
Kin, and Middle East, but a chance meeting with Limp Bizkit singer
Fred Durst has propelled the band to a larger spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   It started when Staind handed a tape to Durst at a Limp Bizkit
show in Hartford two years ago, then they saw Bizkit again at a St.
John's Gym show in Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 2:30 in the morning after that show and my phone
rang,'' says Staind guitarist Mike Mushok. ``I heard our tape
blaring in the background as Fred said, `I love this. I'm going to
get you signed.' '' Durst kept his word and co-produced the new
``Dysfunction,'' a high-octane, atomic bomb of an album that has
come out on Elektra Records. Durst also got the band signed with
the Firm, a management agency that represents Bizkit and Korn.
</P>
<P>
   Staind has lyrics that make Pearl Jam seem like well-adjusted
Boy Scouts. Singer-lyricist Aaron Lewis sings: ``I hate myself and
I hate my face and I hate my world.'' Maybe he'll be hating it a
little less now that the record is selling, but regardless, he
sounds genuine and is a remarkably powerful singer. ``When I first
heard him, he was in my cellar with just an acoustic guitar, but he
woke my parents up,'' says Mushok.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Sunday's Worcester show, Staind is expected to open for
Limp Bizkit this summer. Look for that tour to hit Lowell's Tsongas
Arena in July.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Bits and Pieces: Dave Matthews has stadium shows in only four
markets this summer. He's at Foxboro Stadium May 29-30, plus two
nights at Giants Stadium in New Jersey, three at Veterans Stadium
in Philadelphia, and one at Mile High Stadium in Denver. Otherwise,
it's sheds and arenas. . . . Guster's new CD is produced by Steve
Lillywhite of U2 fame and will be out Aug. 3. . . . Aerosmith plays
the Hollywood Bowl Friday night. The band's return to the Tweeter
Center, though, now appears unlikely. Aerosmith's last show of the
tour will be Woodstock '99. They'll also be feted this summer with
the opening of an Aerosmith ride at Disneyland. Details to come. .
. . Sad news: Boston-based Joe Pope, who published the Beatles
fanzine Strawberry Fields Forever, died April 22. Nazareth drummer
Darrell Sweet died of a heart attack before a show in New Albany,
Ind., April 30.

A PRESENTATION WORTHY OF EVERYONE'S `EXPECTATIONS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
GREAT EXPECTATIONS 
Directed by: Julian Jarrold 
Starring: Ioan Gruffudd, Justine Waddell, Bernard Hill, Ian
McDiarmid, Charlotte Rampling, Clive Russell 
On: PBS, Ch. 2, Sunday and Monday nights at 9 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not too surprising that moviemakers continue to mine the
novels of Charles Dickens. For one thing, Dickens's best work is
profoundly cinematic, as it reaches from the shadowy, grimy London
lowlife to the lonely landscapes of rural England. Just the
topography of his vivid characters' faces would be enough to seduce
a filmmaker. And Dickens invites contemporary interpretation with
his moral passion for elaborate plots that cross over
socio-economic boundaries. So many contemporary writers, after all,
aim for smaller, more culturally specific stories. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's one quality in Dickens' fiction, however, that doesn't
travel easily to the 20th century: sentimentality. And that is the
one quality that the appealing new PBS adaptation of ``Great
Expectations'' wisely avoids. Presented on Sunday and Monday nights
at 9 as part of ``Masterpiece Theatre,'' this BBC-WGBH production
is a cool, picturesque, suspenseful, and slightly ambiguous movie
that hardly recalls director David Lean's 1946 black-and-white
version, the most famous film of the novel. It has a look and feel
of its own, with a realism that well suits Dickens' famous tale of
a poor boy who is made into a gentleman with the help of a
mysterious benefactor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most obviously, the cinematography in this ``Great
Expectations'' is dynamic and gritty, with sustained close ups of
the maggots and rats crawling over Miss Havisham's rotting wedding
table, and glimpses of blood trickling along the streets of
London's marketplace. As the adult Estella waits for Pip on a gray
street, her red dress is a small explosion of color, and lawyer
Jaggers' office is a lofty morgue out of ``The Cook, the Thief, His
Wife, and Her Lover.'' The camera moves right up to the faces --
the mouth of the piggish Pumblechook as he eats, the hateful eyes
of Pip's cruel sister -- as often as it distantly pans the marshes
of the North Country where Pip grows up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But, more subtly, director Julian Jarrold distinguishes his
movie by keeping the reigns in on his characters, emotionally and
morally. They are unromanticized and low-key performances that only
rarely spill over into the maudlin and righteous. As Pip, Ioan
Gruffudd (pronounced YO-an GRIF-ith) is unshakeably deadpan, an
approach that works slowly but surely. By the end of the movie,
once his character has grown from an arrogant youth into a true
gentleman, Gruffudd's wide-eyed face acquires a hidden, but
definite, air of nobility. His expressive final scenes with the
dying Magwitch, the man he accepts as his father, work beautifully
because of Gruffudd's previous restraint. Justine Waddell deepens
her dollike Estella with similarly slight shifts, changing almost
invisibly from the heartless pawn of Miss Havisham to the needy
rejected wife of the nefarious Bentley Drummle. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Miss Havisham, Charlotte Rampling is remarkably effective.
She avoids appearing demented and over the top, emphasizing instead
the wounded side of the jilted woman who plays ruthlessly with Pip
and Estella. Her power over the two children has as much to do with
her insidious, hypnotic personality as it does with her money.
Jarrold avoids lapsing into cartoonishness throughout, not even
letting the good characters -- Biddy, for instance, or Joe --
appear too unbelievably good. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour movie, shown in two parts, might have benefited
from another hour or two. Some of the pacing is off, as the plot
starts its inevitable, Dickensian slide toward denouement before
our curiosity has been sufficiently aroused. Also, some of the
smaller characters -- Jaggers, for instance -- could stand closer
scrutiny. Surely, in 1999, there is more than a small interest in
lawyers who are detached from the consequences of their work.

`MUMMY' TOO WRAPPED UP IN SPECIAL EFFECTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE MUMMY 
Directed and written by: Stephen Sommers 
Starring: Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo,
Kevin J. O'Connor, Jonathan Hyde 
Running time: 134 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (pervasive adventure violence and some partial
nudity) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's more Indiana Jones than Boris Karloff in the remake of
``The Mummy.'' What was original about the original 1932 version
was its spooky romanticism. Subtly lit and potently shadowy, it
projected the silence of the grave. So moody a piece was obviously
deemed insufficiently commercial for the '90s, but the route taken
by the new version just isn't as interesting. Instead of being
haunted by the mummified 4,000-year-old priest, who was sealed into
a stone sarcophagus with a swarm of flesh-eating beetles as
punishment for making love to the pharaoh's mistress, and never got
over it, the film seems haunted by the image of Harrison Ford
swashbuckling his way out of a succession of tight corners.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Fraser brings all the right equipment to what turns out
to be an insufficiently imagined conception. He's strappingly
energetic in the action scenes, supplying a comic-strip heightening
that preserves a knife-edged balance between heroics and zaniness.
Rachel Weisz brings a kewpie-doll mischievousness to the part of
the female lead, projecting in the desert a competence that her
character isn't allowed to show back in so-called civilization (the
film takes place in the 1920s, a time when the clothes and cars are
snazzy, but attitudes toward women and non-whites aren't). And John
Hannah segues nicely from ``Sliding Doors'' to a role as her twerpy
brother who somehow stumbles into more than his share of good luck.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think that even a scriptful of sheltered treasure-hunters
would have seen enough Egyptian tomb movies to know enough to take
seriously the curses plastered all over every stone and metal
surface in Egypt. But no. This genre depends on nobody taking dire
warnings seriously, so into danger this bunch plunges, scratching
about for treasure in a city of the dead after a prologue that
plays like live outtakes from ``The Prince of Egypt,'' showing us
what they're in for. Actually, the scariest thing in ``The Mummy''
isn't the mummy. It's a swarm of computer-generated beetles that
pop out of iridiscent scarab shells, literally get under the skin
of anybody unlucky enough to be in their path, and promptly devour
them.
</P>
<P>
   The computer-generated Mummy looks more campy and funny than
frightening. No tape, just a lot of decomposed innards clinging to
a skull and skeleton, suggesting grey spaghetti. Moreover, the
mummy and its army of mummy priests and soldiers move so rapidly
that they're only startling, but never really scary. It would have
been much creepier to have them move with slow inexorability. Most
run-of-the-mill theme parks have scarier creatures, and it's here
where the film stumbles most seriously, wasting its authentic
eye-filling Moroccan locations. This ``Mummy'' remake, despite the
actors' spirited work ethic, just seems to be going through a
series of motions so obviously virtual that it makes you wish that
the filmmakers had stayed away from the computer keyboards entirely
and stuck with the rotting tape look.

THE VIOLENT GAME CALLED TV NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a Senate hearing Tuesday on violent youth entertainment,
Kansas Republican Sam Brownback railed against ``movies that depict
teens killing their classmates; music with lyrics that glorify
suicide, torture, and murder; TV that trivializes the consequences
of violence; and video games that simulate real-life killing and
give points for each death.''
</P>
<P>
   Utah's Orrin Hatch and Connecticut's Joseph Lieberman raised the
idea of a federal probe into the marketing of violent video games,
movies, and music. Lieberman said that senators do not want to
resort to regulation, but if the entertainment industry ``continues
to market death and degradation to our children, and continues to
pay no heed to the genuine bloodshed staining our communities, then
one way or the other, the government will act.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Education Secretary William Bennett showed clips of
violent movies that made some in the audience turn their heads.
After the second clip, Bennett asked: ``Had enough?''
</P>
<P>
   Have we ``had enough'' of the marketing of death? I doubt it,
since meaningful gun control is still way off the table on Capitol
Hill. I also doubt it because while the question is being asked
with refreshing force about our fantasies and fiction, Littleton
has not yet sparked a simultaneous tossing and turning in the
medium that we get our real information from: The news.
</P>
<P>
   In our family, we turned off the local TV news a decade ago. We
refused to be prisoners to ``If it bleeds, it leads.'' This is
humorous to television executives, but it has led to a horrible
distortion of the world we present to our families.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 study by the University of Miami of local TV news in New
York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, Indianapolis, Austin, Texas,
Syracuse, N.Y., and Eugene, Ore., found that 29 percent of
newscasts were about crime. A study last year found that 33 percent
of local TV news in Baltimore and Philadelphia was on crime.
</P>
<P>
   Crime received twice as much coverage than politics in the Miami
study and 14 times more than education and 24 times more than race
relations. Of course, as a 1994 study of Chicago TV news found,
news executives degrade race relations by disproportionately
singling out black criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Princell Hair, news director at the NBC affiliate in Baltimore,
said stations sometimes purposely tie a real murder story to lead
the late-night news right after movies on the Mafia and shows like
``Homicide.'' ``Whenever we have the opportunity to tie into a
preceding program, we try to take advantage of it,'' Hair said.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, the news media cross the line into a ratings game
that, no less than a video game, gets points for every death.
``What television seems to cultivate is what we call the
`mean-world syndrome,' said longtime media analyst George Gerbner
of the Annenberg School of Communication at the University of
Pennsylvania. ``If you're growing up in a heavy-viewing home, for
all practical purposes, you live in a meaner world.''
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of evidence that constant exposure to mean
worlds creates meaner people, whether we are talking about
aggression after watching ``Power Rangers'' or the rise of crime
among nations and groups of people as they watched more television.
</P>
<P>
   There is so much evidence that there is no longer any excuse to
present news as one-third crime. Crime rates have fallen in most
cities. There is no excuse to report on violence with no context. A
1997 study of 26 California TV stations found that 84 percent of
stories on violence covered just the act, but no factors that led
to or could have prevented the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Every one is angry about how innocence was stolen at Columbine
High. TV news steals innocence every night. The California study
found that even though less than one-half of 1 percent of youths 10
to17 years old were arrested for violent crimes in 1994, 55 percent
of the television news stories on youths involved violence.
</P>
<P>
   It is no wonder, then, that despite the highly publicized
national drop in violent crime, a Gallup poll last fall showed that
56 percent of Americans felt there was more crime than five years
ago, compared to 35 percent who felt there was less.
</P>
<P>
   Had enough? The answer will be yes when Americans reject the
distorted reality that passes as news; when we reject not only the
quantity of stories about violence but also photos of dead bodies
that do not add to stories; and when we stop stripping people of
their dignity. Do we need to see mothers in primal screams at death
scenes? Do we need to hear every 911 call?
</P>
<P>
   The answer will be yes when we reject ``news'' that becomes
wallet photos for gang members and Trenchcoat wannabes. The answer
will be yes when we stop feeding on a fear and paranoia that
focuses us more on revenge and the death penalty than the
prevention of gun control. Had enough? We can prove it by sending
the news makers a loud and clear message. Click.

ON-LINE GROUP ORGANIZES UNIQUE AID FOR REFUGEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like many other concerned citizens, Douglas P. Williams has been
haunted by the images of refugees streaming out of Kosovo, limping
across the border with empty hands and empty eyes. From his home in
Boston, Williams felt there must be something he could do to help,
so shortly after he began hearing reports of atrocities in the
Balkans, he contacted more than a dozen aid organizations working
in the area and offered to volunteer. He was turned down by all of
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were looking for medical help,'' said Williams, 27, a
marketing professional who is between jobs. ``Or they only relied
on experienced volunteers. It was frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he came upon a group on the Internet called the Balkan
Sunflowers, and he found his calling. He's now working as the US
coordinator for the grass-roots organization and receives 70
e-mails a day from kindred spirits nationwide. He will join other
Sunflower volunteers in Albania or Macedonia early next month to
work in the refugee camps. The group, organized exclusively on the
Web, has already amassed volunteers working in 20 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to supplement the essentials provided by traditional
humanitarian groups. The Red Cross, for instance, distributes food
for the body; the Balkan Sunflowers offers sustenance for the soul,
organizing schools and play groups, arts projects and sports
events, self-help groups and cottage industries.
</P>
<P>
   The unique effort was launched by Wam Kat, a Dutch sociologist
who has spent seven years promoting nonviolent conflict resolution
in Eastern Europe. In 1992, he traveled to Zagreb, a city divided
by the war between the Croats and the Serbs. UN peacekeeping forces
had occupied Zagreb, and the streets were littered with sandbags
used to shore up antiartillery shelters all over the city. Kat
planted sunflower seeds in the sandbags, and when the plants
blossomed, the flowers became a symbol of hope and the metaphor for
Kat's humanitarian work.
</P>
<P>
   Kat, 43, spearheaded SunCokret (Croatian for sunflower), a
grass-roots organization made up of 5,000 international volunteers
who helped rebuild the Croatian town of Pakrac, among other
projects. Members of the group came from all over the globe, from
South Africa to South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a way of empowering people to say, `OK, there is a way
we can help even if we are not trained in special situations,' ''
Kat said from Germany, just before he set off for Albania to set up
the Sunflower office there. ``This is about the emotions of normal
people who are saying, `This is not human. We should start acting.'
You could say that professionals have to do this job, but I think
it should just be humans doing the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanja Nikolic is one of those humans. Born in a small town in
Croatia, she was a student in Zagreb when SunCokret sprouted. ``I
am not a statement-writing or demonstrations against war or
peace-marching sort of activist,'' she said. ``I love concrete,
grass-roots, practical and creative types of work.'' Since working
with the Sunflower efforts, she is now a full-time activist at the
Center for Peace Studies in Zagreb.
</P>
<P>
   Though its 1992 creation was two years before the invention of
the Web, news of Sunflower's work spread worldwide when Kat
published his Zagreb diary on electronic bulletin boards. The group
caught the attention of Vice President Al Gore, who applauded it in
a 1994 speech about global communication. ``After reading Kat's
Croatian diary, people around the world began to send money for
relief efforts,'' Gore said. ``The result: 25 houses have been
built in a town destroyed by war. Governments didn't do this.
People did. But such events are the hope of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those who took action is Sinisa Slijepcevic, who was a
21-year old math major at the University of Zagreb in 1992. He
spent six months working with children in Sadudrija, a refugee camp
in Croatia near the Italian border. ``Most of my friends went to
fight, but I was lucky enough not to have to go,'' said
Slijepcevic, now a doctoral student at the Cambridge University.
``But I couldn't just stay home and not do something.''
</P>
<P>
   The group also recruited former Croatian soldiers to its cause.
``I would run into them and say, `You are perfect for running a
children's garden,' '' Kat recalled. ``They would say, `You are a
fool. I am a soldier.' But they actually learned to do it, and some
of them stayed working with children and became very good at it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Balkan Sunflowers will attempt to plant such gardens in
refugee camps in Albania and Macedonia, working to improve quality
of life for the refugees once their essential needs have been met
by the traditional aid operations. The group emphasizes that its
work is not about rescue efforts; it is about relieving the
monotony of life in the refugee camps and establishing a sense of
normalcy under abnormal conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't do this kind of work if you want to change the world
or solve other people's problems,'' said Kees Driessen, a Dutch
psychology student who volunteered in 1992 and will travel to the
camps later this year. ``It's about simple things such as
organizing a Christmas party . . . or learning to make something,
painting for the first time in your life, acting in some small
play. It's not feeding my soul but feeding their brains with
something other than misery and dread.''
</P>
<P>
   Driessen, like other volunteers, was untrained but motivated
when he joined the group. Volunteers receive about a week's worth
of training before they go into the field for stays of three weeks.
Kat and his colleagues are planning the training sessions now, in
addition to setting up field offices in Skopje and Tirana and
connecting with such established groups as the International Rescue
Committee and the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees,
which supported their work during the Croatian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Kat is treading carefully as he does the groundwork for the
volunteers. ``We are not naive,'' he said. ``We're not saying,
`Just get on an airplane and come.' There is enough chaos going on,
and we have to try to find a way to help rather than create more
chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   When Williams and the US volunteers make their sojourn next
month, they will live in the same conditions as the refugees.
Brought together by sophisticated technology, they will work
together in primitive conditions. ``The camps are hell,'' recalled
Slijepcevic, who plans to volunteer again once he submits his
doctoral thesis in June.
</P>
<P>
   But for the members of this unusual cyber group, the experience
has changed their lives. ``It brought war, the effects of war,
closer to home, but it also brought it down to earth,'' said
Driessen. ``It all comes down to this: War is simple, peace is
difficult. And as soon as the fighting stops, the struggle for
peace begins.''

<P>
   It is the second departure of one of the ad agency's three
principal owners in a little more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   Garrison said the departures were coincidental and unrelated.
``This is not an owners-in-collision situation,'' said Garrison,
who added that the purpose of the restructuring was to position the
agency for robust growth in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Following last week's sale of Mullen to a unit of a New York
communications giant, Boston-based Ingalls has emerged as the
largest independently owned ad agency in New England and the
region's fourth-largest agency as measured by billings.
</P>
<P>
   But Ingalls, whose big clients include T.J. Maxx, Radisson
Hotels, and Citizens Bank, endured a lackluster 1998 while New
England's three largest agencies, now all controlled by outsiders,
enjoyed growth of 20 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   Garrison, who is also the majority owner of Ingalls, says he has
no plans to sell Ingalls and follow the lead of Hill Holliday
Connors Cosmopulos, Arnold Communications, and Mullen.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ingalls just won the account for the Cambridge
SoundWorks retail chain, it has gone through a string of
second-place finishes in recent ad agency pitches.
</P>
<P>
   According to Garrison, that had nothing to do with the departure
of Steve Connelly as president of Ingalls Advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly's departure may be partly a sign of the times as money
made from creating TV and print ads account for a smaller and
smaller percentage of an agencies' total revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the action _ and profits _ now come from direct
marketing, interactive marketing, and public relations. Ingalls had
been organized into six divisions. Besides the advertising unit
under Connelly, there were, among others, an interactive marketing
unit and a PR shop.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to differentiate itself from other ad agencies and to
help clients better build brands, those units have been integrated
into a single entity under a ``brand team'' of 10 people reporting
to Garrison.
</P>
<P>
   But one side effect of that restructuring may have been that
Connelly's bailiwick, traditional advertising, lost some of its
preeminence over PR and other disciplines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We offered Steve a spot on the team, but he chose not to take
it,'' Garrison said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bink felt we needed one leader going forward and he was
determined to be that leader,'' said Connelly. ``I'm deciding what
to do with my life right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Connelly owns a piece of Ingalls, but both he and Garrison
declined to say how the ownership issue would be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to offer a variety of services, many agencies are now
made up of several divisions _ one for advertising, another for PR,
each accountable for its own profit-and-loss statement. That means
there's no incentive for the ad department to propose a
direct-marketing solution because revenues then might be credited
to a different agency unit. By integrating all divisions into a
single entity, Garrison hopes to transform Ingalls into a single
brand team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes a lot of sense for them,'' said Adweek New England
editor Judy Warner of the restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly is the second top official to leave Ingalls recently.
About a month ago, executive vice president Tom Block resigned to
take a job with an Internet company in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The new job was too good to resist, and in no way should his
departure be interpreted as bailing out of Ingalls, Block said.
</P>
<P>
   Garrison said Thursday he does not expect more departures; the
restructuring will result in no layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In this market at least, it seems that big and small shops can
thrive, but the middle can be a tough place.
</P>
<P>
   One reason other local agencies agreed to be bought by outside
companies: They could be part of a larger network that lets them
offer their clients a wider range of services and benefit from
economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
   But Garrison sees an opportunity in winning the business of
firms with annual advertising budgets of $7 million to $18 million.
They're too big for a boutique ad agency to handle but too small
for a behemoth, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Ingalls had billings of $141 million; revenues fell 9
percent to $17 million after four years of growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ingalls has been around for more than 75 years,'' says Skip
Pile of Pile and Co., a Boston firm that helps companies find ad
agencies. ``And Bink Garrison is resourceful and creative. There's
no doubt they'll survive.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Larry King, known almost as well for his serial marriages as
his &UR;  &LR; softball interview style on CNN, is Splitsville again: this
time from his longtime Boston agent, Bob Woolf Associates.
</P>
<P>
   National Enquirer, start your engines!
</P>
<P>
   Can you imagine where this could go? King, the 65-year-old,
gravel-voiced broadcaster, has been with Woolf longer than any of
his seven wives. Over the last two decades Woolf has negotiated the
contracts, arranged the speaking engagements, coordinated the
weddings (and the divorces), bought all those gifts for all those
women, some of whom ended up as wives, some of whom didn't. Talk
about knowing where the bodies are buried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think King has thought through what he is going to
have to go through in this case,'' Boston attorney Harry L. Manion
III, who has sued the King of Gab on behalf of the Woolf agency,
warns not so subtly.
</P>
<P>
   Now that this long marriage is quite definitely done, there's
the matter of the financial settlement. And Woolf, run by Larry
Moulter, the man who helped buy the down-and-out agency in 1996
after founder Bob Woolf's death, says King owes it roughly $1.3
million as its share of King's latest CNN contract.
</P>
<P>
   A King spokesman didn't return my calls.
</P>
<P>
   The basic facts in a nutshell:
</P>
<P>
   Bob Woolf, a pioneer in the business, had been King's agent
since 1978, when King was making $50,000 a year as a Miami DJ. As
King's star rose, so did his paycheck. In 1993, just before he
died, Woolf negotiated a $14 million CNN contract for King, running
into this year. Woolf's cut: 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, with Woolf dead, King got the agency to cut its share
to 7.5 percent. According to the Woolf suit, the agency agreed to
reduce its fee in exchange for a promise that it would receive 5
percent on any future contracts ``or any modifications, extensions
or renewals thereof irregardless (sic) or whether (Woolf
Associates) negotiaties the contract, modifications, extensions or
renewals.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year International Creative Management, the giant Hollywood
talent agency, negotiated a new five-year, $25 million CNN contract
for King. Woolf maintains it is entitled to 5 percent of that deal.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Moulter says King wanted to change his deal
with Woolf to a flat-fee arrangement, and the agency tried to
accommodate him. King later wanted a contract that would only pay
Woolf a commission on any new deals it brought him. Moulter called
King's latest proposal, made just last week, ``worse than an
insult.''
</P>
<P>
   Moulter and his people sound a little like the good wife who
raised the kids and worked part-time to get hubby through med
school only to be dumped when the big dough started rolling in.
Woolf, and its lawyer Manion, could be just about as willing to
even the score, too.
</P>
<P>
   What did Woolf do for King?
</P>
<P>
   There was the time Woolf overnighted a diamond ring to a hotel
room so King could get engaged on the spot. (This was, ultimately,
one union that didn't happen.) There were years of shopping for
expensive gifts for the wives, the ex-wives, and the girlfriends,
not to mention cars for the children of the wives and girlfriends.
</P>
<P>
   Woolf helped King manage his 1985 bankruptcy. And it is still
steamed about the one-man Broadway-bound show it helped King
develop, right up through the preview in Louisville, only to have
King walk away after a single performance.
</P>
<P>
   There was the time, just two days before he was to get married
in 1997 to his current wife, 39-year-old Shawn Southwick, that
Woolf arranged a Medivac flight from Los Angeles to New York for
heart surgery. Woolf recommended _ and King rejected _ that he sign
a prenuptial agreement; think Mrs. King number seven might still
harbor a little resentment?
</P>
<P>
   This could be fun in discovery, unless you're Larry King.
</P>
<P>
   Says Moulter: ``Our agency believes the relationship is a
two-way street. We can only help a client if a client wants to be
helped.''
</P>
<P>
   Call me a homer, but I'll take my chances in a foxhole with
Moulter. He may not be half as entertaining, but 20 years later,
he's still on marriage number one.

EMERGING MARKET FUNDS RIDING HIGH IN CYCLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark Madden has been waiting years now for a market like this.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't own suddenly rediscovered value stocks or an obscure
corner of commerce blessed by the Internet bug. Madden, manager of
the Pioneer Emerging Markets fund, is invested in Asia, Latin
America, and developing economies in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Madden and other managers like him are among some of the best
performers of the mutual fund world this year. His Emerging Markets
fund was up 27.7 percent for 1999 as of midweek, and most of its
competitors have gained 20 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   The rally hasn't come a minute too soon. The five previous
years, highlighted by Asia's collapse of 1997, Russia's financial
meltdown in 1998, and the scare of an economic contagion in Latin
America that peaked at the start of 1999, have pulverized emerging
market funds.
</P>
<P>
   Madden points to cycles, typically lasting several years, that
alternately trounce and boost emerging stock markets. This, he
hopes, is the latest turning point in the cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're going to see a period of pretty good returns,''
he said. ``Retail and institutional money will start to reallocate
(into emerging stocks) and that will drive these markets for two or
three years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   To get an idea how tough emerging markets have been on mutual
fund investors, consider the track record of State Street Global
Advisors' Emerging Markets fund. It ranks as the single best
emerging markets fund over the last five years but returned a mere
16.95 percent during that period, according to Lipper Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 25 emerging market funds with five-year track records, 21
have lost money. During the same period, the US stock market
boomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our net asset value has returned to the levels where it was in
1998,'' said Tom Haslett, chief investment officer for emerging
markets at Putnam Investments. ``So if you went back a little
further you would find we're still massively below the levels where
emerging market funds were in the first half of 1997, before the
Asian crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   The revival of emerging market funds began modestly near the end
of 1998, when Korea and a few other Asian countries bounced off
rock bottom and began to climb.
</P>
<P>
   But the true spark took place half a world away in January, when
officials in Brazil first decided to devalue their currency and
days later chose to let the value of the real float. The economic
crisis that seemed imminent began to fade and stocks soared.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the good news for Latin America's largest economy,
Brazil's bounce nipped worries that trouble would spread to a new
continent.
</P>
<P>
   But further gains in emerging markets around the world are
strikingly dependent on many events, some of them beyond the
control of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, business has to continue to improve. The gap in
price-earnings ratios awarded to emerging market stocks and US
equities is larger than historical norms, but not wildly out of
whack. Emerging market stock profits need to grow.
</P>
<P>
   A key economy that needs to remain stable for all emerging
markets to perform well: the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emerging markets are exporters, they need the developed world
to be growing to accept their exports,'' said Joshua Feuerman,
manager of the State Street Global Advisors Emerging Markets fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we saw a dramatic slowdown in the US market, that would
negatively affect emerging markets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging countries also need international investors to take
notice of improving conditions and redirect money into those
markets. In small markets with limited liqiuidity, nothing succeeds
like success, though it can also be disastrous in excess.
</P>
<P>
   The value of all the world's emerging market stocks is less than
the combined capitalization of General Electric Co. and Microsoft
Corp. They don't require huge investment to push prices higher.
</P>
<P>
   Most funds dedicated to emerging markets have liquidated cash
positions and become fully invested in stocks over the last six
months. Despite their big returns so far this year, investors have
not pumped significant new cash into the emerging funds.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer's Madden believes the next source of additional
investment for emerging stocks will come from global funds that
usually invest in the United States and more conservative
international markets.
</P>
<P>
   Global funds, which combined manage about 13 times the assets of
emerging market funds, may have about 1 percent of their money sunk
in developing markets at the moment, according to Madden. ``Before
this is all over, we'll see them at 10 percent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But if emerging market investors have discovered anything in the
1990s, it is that plenty of surprises can throw them off the path
to riches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is getting in and waiting it out,'' said Feuerman. It
can be a long wait.

LAST LICKS FOR THE BIG `LOLLIPOP'? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's an outdoor art flap percolating in Boston, where the new
owners of 100 Summer St. are not-so-graciously giving the heave-ho
to Gloucester, Mass. artist Rob Amory's 26-foot-tall kinetic
sculpture, ``Helion.'' More informally known as the ``Lollipop''
sculpture, the gaudy orange assemblage has been a landmark for
almost 25 years. The site's new owners, Chicago-based Equity Office
Properties Trust, plan to ``reposition'' (read: raise rents) the
building, and they want ``Helion'' out of there.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, no one wants the thing. The Children's Museum
doesn't want it. The University of Massachusetts won't take it for
their harborside sculpture garden. ``It's an unfortunate kind of
deflated pop art,'' UMass art historian Paul Tucker told the Wall
Street Journal. Amory is waging a publicity counterattack through
his lawyer against what he perceives as negative coverage of the
sculpture's plight in the Journal and by WHDH-Ch. 7, Boston.
</P>
<P>
   I am in receipt of two testimonials, drafted by friends of
Amory's, hailing the timeless nature of ``Helion'' 's contribution
to the Boston landscape. New York-based artist Karen Lukas bemoans
Boston's shortsightedness in ditching the sculpture: ``The
philosophy of New Urbanism and its emphasis on humanism and
diversity relating to architecture and urban development has arisen
in response to this lack of perspective and represents a corrective
effort to restore a sense of continuum and familiarity within our
environments.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey _ she's an artist, not a writer . . .
</P>
<P>
   I like Amory, and I gently suggested that a quarter-century was
a pretty good run for a project that he got paid for. How many
books, I asked, stay in print for 25 years? (Answer: virtually
none.) But he was not to be assuaged. ``This piece has spoken to a
lot of people,'' he says. ``I think it still has life to it.''

   It was exactly a year ago that liberal dweebs ran Boston Beer
Co. founder Jim Koch out of his Little League sponsorship (Globe,
May 6, 1998). Koch, who had been invited to become a sponsor, was
hooted out of the league where his own son played baseball when the
PC patrol took offense at a Boston Lager poster in left field _ a
poster that read: ``Our beer is carefully aged before drinking. You
should be, too.''
</P>
<P>
   So one can only imagine the reaction of the Volvo-NPRniks when
they discover that 11-teaspoons-of-sugar-per-serving Pepsi is
invading Boston's Little League. Pop quiz: Which is the greater
health problem in America? Sugar-fueled obesity or alcoholism?
(Answer: obesity.) But I digress . . .
</P>
<P>
   Here are the facts. Pepsi has just launched its ``Takin' It to
the Field'' promotion in the Greater Boston area. Little League
coaches who participate agree to display a 3-foot-tall cooler
designed like a Pepsi can on the sidelines during the game. They
also get 144 free Pepsis, a free score pad, and some coupons for
Pizza Hut comestibles and Major League Baseball kitsch. Pepsi has
assigned ``spotters'' to roam the ballfields and hand out more
rubbish to the teams that have the coolers displayed front and
center.
</P>
<P>
   About a thousand teams have signed up for the free caffeine and
sugar water, says Pepsi spokesman Dave DeCecco. ``Most people love
it because they'd take the kids out for a soft drink after the game
anyway, and now they don't have to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   I've discussed the promotion with coaches in Watertown, Newton,
and Roslindale. Some have refused the offer and some have signed
on. (One friend attributes a recent late-inning comeback victory to
a much-needed Pepsi jolt.) One coach who turned down the Pepsi
offer admits that his decision triggered a near revolt in the
dugout. ``The kids think I'm nuts,'' he admits. ``They'd love to
have a soft drink after the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi in Little League? I'm told the really interesting story is
how Coca-Cola has insinuated itself into the middle schools. A
future column perhaps . . .

AS BAD MEMORIES OF '97 FADE, TALBOTS LOOKS TO REGAIN MOMENTUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a fashion misstep two years ago, can Talbots Inc. regain
the momentum it enjoyed in the early 1990s?
</P>
<P>
   President and chief executive Arnold B. Zetcher thinks so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're right on target now,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Hingham, Mass. retailer's 50th anniversary, Talbots
had a midlife crisis, or what Queen Elizabeth might call an ``annus
horribilis'' _ a horrible year.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the 1990s, Talbots boomed as its stores and catalogs
sold classic clothing, shoes, and accessories to affluent women 35
and older.
</P>
<P>
   But overreacting perhaps to casual Fridays and a move toward
less formal careerwear, Talbots attempted in 1997 to woo younger
women with some shorter skirts and flashier styling.
</P>
<P>
   What ensued was disaster, as what was meant to be incremental
shift turned into a radical fashion faux pas in execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``1997 was horrible,'' concedes Zetcher, who adds, ``I don't
ever want to go through another 1997.''
</P>
<P>
   Young women weren't at all impressed by the 1997 fashions, and
the chain's loyal middle-aged customers reacted with shock and
dismay. The result? Profits dropped lower than an ankle-length
skirt's hem line _ from $63.6 million to $5.84 million.
</P>
<P>
   Talbots has since repaired much of its self-inflicted damage,
rebounding to a profit of $36.7 million last year as it won back
many of its core customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``1998 was a comeback, a very good year,'' Zetcher says.
</P>
<P>
   So far in 1999, the comeback seems to be continuing apace.
Talbots said Thursday first-quarter earnings should be above Wall
Street's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Talbots' experience is an extreme example of what can happen
when a retailer implements a new strategy too suddenly. Having come
full circle, Talbots has been able to return to its roots and win
back customers.
</P>
<P>
   But for Talbots a question remains: Can the chain regain the
momentum it enjoyed in the mid '90s?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the big question,'' says PaineWebber analyst Richard E.
Jaffe, who's in the wait-and-see mode.
</P>
<P>
   Besides lengthening skirts and returning to classic styles,
Talbots has taken a number of steps to avoid another 1997. It's
replaced its merchant team twice. And new checks and balances are
in place to prevent another fashion mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The company has also introduced a larger-sized clothing line,
and an ad campaign created by Arnold Communications of Boston
promotes the image of a customer who wants to be well dresed but is
too smart to be gulled by Paris fashion trends.
</P>
<P>
   If the 1997 plan was to expand the customer base and sell to
women under 35 and over 35, part of the comeback strategy is to
persuade women who are already customers to spend a bigger share of
their wardrobe dollars at Talbots.
</P>
<P>
   A second part of the strategy is to attract middle-aged women
who don't include Talbots on the list of clothing stores they shop.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Talbots is trying to listen more closely to its
customers who can get passionate about its clothing and who were
appalled by the chain's fashion shift in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   `` `You jilted me! I've got no place to shop,' '' Zetcher says
of the feedback he got in customer focus groups.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Talbots, some trends now break its way.
</P>
<P>
   Clothing sales are strong for many retailers, and pastels are
nearly as hot this spring as capri pants and Irish linen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pastels help Talbots,'' says Hambrecht &AMP; Quist analyst Harry
A. Ikenson, adding, ``We're having one of the strongest spring
seasons for apparel for the entire decade.''
</P>
<P>
   After major consolidation among department-store chains, many
consumers find department store merchandise ``homogenized and
stale,'' analyst Jaffe says; looking for excitement, more are
shopping at specialty chains such as the Limited and Ann Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Talbots may be another beneficiary of this shift. Sales at
Talbots have been ``above plan'' since last fall, Ikenson says.
</P>
<P>
   For its most recent fiscal year, Talbots had sales of $1.142
billion, up from $1.054 billion. Roughly 15 percent of sales come
from the 53 million catalogs it mailed out last year, but catalogs
also play a key role in attracting traffic to the chain's 651
stores, which include Misses, Petites, and Kids stores.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of store customers receive a Talbots catalog,
says Michele Mandell, Talbots senior vice president of stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come into the stores with dog-eared copies'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In helping to put together the fateful spring collection of
1997, Zetcher was like someone trying to figure out a jigsaw
puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   With a lead time of more than a year, Zetcher could look at one
or two pieces of the puzzle at a time, but he says he never saw the
full picture until he walked into a Talbots store in Memphis in
early spring 1997. What in planning was meant to be a nuanced
change was, in reality, a dramatic departure from what Talbots was
known for.
</P>
<P>
   By his own account, what Zetcher saw in Memphis nearly floored
him, a vista of low hemlines and trendiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't seen the whole assortment together before,'' Zetcher
says. ``I stopped and said, `Wait a second. Where am I? Show me
what's classic.' And they couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customer expects us to upgrade our fashion with regularity
but not go to extremes,'' Zetcher says.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, he says, ``We went too far.''
</P>
<P>
   In looking back at 1997, the chain's great strength may have
also turned out to be its great weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike department stores, which stock their apparel sections
with a wide variety of designer labels, nearly everything sold by
Talbots is made exclusively for the chain through contracts with
clothing factories around the world.
</P>
<P>
   When popular, this so-called private-label clothing provides a
retailer with a high profit margin. With designer clothing, in
contrast, store profits are shared with the designer.
</P>
<P>
   For a retailer, the downside of private label is that the
operative cliche can be ``having all your eggs in one basket.''
</P>
<P>
   A department store can spread its bets. If one designer label
fares poorly, merchandise can quickly be replaced, an option
unavailable to a retailer reliant on private label.
</P>
<P>
   ``A private-label company is less nimble,'' Zetcher says.
``There's risk with private label.''
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, a retailer will use a catalog to test a new
clothing line. That's what L.L. Bean Inc. may be doing with
Freeport Studio, a line of women's career-wear that's a far cry
from the outdoor clothing stocked at Bean's store in Freeport.
</P>
<P>
   If Bean is cautiously experimenting in 1999, Talbots seemed to
take a headlong leap in 1997, stocking too much of what turned out
to be unwanted inventory. To clear out this merchandise, Talbots
had to mark down prices, which hurt profits.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how Talbots could have so miscalculated, Zetcher noted the
chain was coming off several years of record performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You end up taking some things for granted that maybe you
shouldn't have,'' he says, adding that perhaps he had delegated too
much authority for the 1997 collection.
</P>
<P>
   Preventive measures, including lower inventory levels, have
since been put in place, and recent revenues, with customers again
paying full price, are cause for optimism, Zetcher stresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the fashion business,'' he says. ``You have to take
chances . . .. We'll continue to make changes. We'll continue to
make mistakes. But I don't think we'll have another 1997.''
</P>
<P>
   Talbots stock, trading near its 52-week high, closed Thursday
down 9/16 at 31 5/8.

ISRAELI HOPEFULS TURN TO AMERICANS TO SHAPE CANDIDACIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ With Pizza Hut and McDonald's ubiquitous across the
Israeli landscape, it should come as no surprise that this country
has imported another franchise: American-style politics.
</P>
<P>
   The result, familiar to Americans but a rude awakening for
Israelis, has been a diet of political fast food that puts sound
bites over substance, shock over complexity, and winning over
governing.
</P>
<P>
   As Israel heads into the final stretch of a too-close-to-call
campaign for prime minister, the messages of the leading candidates
are being shaped by two of America's most influential Washington
insiders. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party
has again hired the reclusive conservative political strategist
Arthur Finkelstein, while challenger Ehud Barak's Labor Party has
brought in liberal pitbull James Carville.
</P>
<P>
   But Israel is not America, especially when it comes to the
issues voters face. In the May 17 election, the issues are: the
fate of the peace process and the redrawing of Israeli-Palestinian
borders, the battle for the soul of Israel as a secular democracy
or a religious state, the deep cultural divides among Israel's
ethnic groups, and a flagging economy that threatens its future.
Overriding these themes is an even more primal concern of security
against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   With such daunting challenges before them, many voters,
political analysts, and even insiders in the campaigns are alarmed
that Israel's electoral debate _ always vitriolic but rarely
lacking substance _ has been reduced to an American brand of slick
TV marketing, attack ads, focus groups, and relentless polling.
</P>
<P>
   In the run up to the May 17 election, Finkelstein, who used
skills honed in Washington to bring Likud to victory in 1996, flew
in last weekend from his horse farm in Ipswich, Mass. and is
running Likud's ``war room'' at an undisclosed location.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's choice, Carville, whose ferocity couched in a Cajun
drawl helped bring President Clinton to the White House in 1992, is
the leader of an American trio of advisers trying to clinch the
election for Labor. For now, he is still advising from Washington,
but has been visiting Israel on and off for months to focus Labor's
message and unleash his trademark tirades on talkshows.
</P>
<P>
   A third important candidate, Yitzhak Mordechai of the new Center
Party, has not retained any American consultants, his staff says,
primarily because they cannot afford them. Despite early excitement
about his prospects, polls show Mordechai slipping dramatically,
while the race between Netanyahu and Barak remains neck and neck.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-paced, no-holds-barred political style imported by
Finkelstein and Carville, critics argue, has encouraged candidates
to obscure their views on seminal issues in favor of a battle over
personalities, trivializing Israeli politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israeli politics has always been tough, but never trivial. The
fact that it is less focused on the issues may be nothing new for
Americans, but it is utterly foreign to us,'' said Leslie Susser,
who covers politics for The Jerusalem Report, an English-language
magazine that targets Israeli and American Jews. ``And it couldn't
have come at a worse moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The images in the parties' television campaign ads are the
battleground in this election, which almost certainly will have to
be settled in the June 1 run-off.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, beginning to trail Barak by as much as 8 percent in
polls taken over the last two days, has stepped up his television
ad campaign of fear, a classically Finkelstein approach. One
searing image is of a burning bus in the aftermath of a suicide
bombing in 1996 by the Islamic resistance movement Hamas, while a
narrator, speaking over the sirens and screams, asks voters,
``Remember this?'' His use of these images is credited with winning
Netanyahu the 1996 election, by less than one percent, over
then-Labor Party leader Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
   This year Netanyahu's party has also focused on the emotionally
charged issue of Jerusalem, whose final status is yet to be debated
under the terms of the 1993 Oslo peace accord. Israel sees the city
as its indivisible and eternal capital, but the Palestinian
leadership sees East Jerusalem, which Israel occupied after the
1967 Six Day War, as the capital of a future state. In one ad,
Netanyahu shows Jews praying at the Western Wall in Jerusalem's Old
City. In reality there are no flags at the wall, but the ad shows
Israeli flags, until the sky darkens and the camera pans up to show
them replaced by Palestinian flags.
</P>
<P>
   Labor's Barak faces the challenge of convincing voters that he,
too, will be tough on terrorism, but that Netanyahu is ``stuck,''
as Barak often puts it, and unable to move a deadlocked peace
process forward. After close scrutiny of focus groups and polls by
Carville and two other American advisers, Bob Shrum and Stanley
Greenberg, Barak seems to have constructed a policy on the peace
process that is nearly indistinguishable from Netanyahu's. He, too,
insists that the future of Jerusalem is ``non-negotiable'' and
fosters an image of toughness by trumpeting his career as a
distinguished army general.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is also using attacks ads. One features ominous shots of
Netanyahu winking to a far-right Cabinet minister who was indicted
on fraud charges. In another, haunting music creeps in over a
scowling Netanyahu, followed by a graphic of rising unemployment as
a narrator asks, ``A hundred thousand people lost their jobs, why
should he keep his?''
</P>
<P>
   Television ads, restricted to only three weeks before the
election, are broadcast nightly in two, half-hour blocks. Most are
a minute or less, and time is allocated based on each party's
representation in the Knesset, or parliament.
</P>
<P>
   This is a unique, almost quaint, Israeli political tradition,
and many analysts saw it as a solid format for debate. Since the
mid-1970S, Israelis gathered around the television to watch focused
explanations of each party's positions. The next day, the parties
would respond to each other or perhaps deepen their message. Visual
techniques were crude, mostly talking heads and a clear focus on
the party platform.
</P>
<P>
   Although American political advisers have come and gone in
elections here since at least 1981, when Prime Minister Menachem
Begin hired David Garth, their presence was previously low key and
they operated within this Israeli style of campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   That began to change in 1996, when Israel shifted to direct
elections for prime minister. Before that, voters had chosen a
political party, which nominated its leader and clumsily
constructed political platforms. In 1996, Netanyahu hired
Finklestein and almost overnight changed Israeli political
discourse by focusing on key issues and personalizing the debate.
He was the first to shorten the ads to 20-second visual blasts with
a slogan of only several words, such as ``Peace with security.''
</P>
<P>
   This time around, ads for both parties are a rush of images.
Sentences are short and declarative. The message is simple. For
Netanyahu, it's security. For Barak, it's the economy. The
graphics, the quick cuts, the music, the mood are as American as
MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Yaron Ezrahi, a professor of political science at Hebrew
University of Jerusalem, said, ``It is utterly unprecedented that
the most salient issue of this campaign is the campaign itself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is discussing the Americanization of our politics,
and mourning the fact that it comes just as we face monumental and
historic decisions about peace and war and borders,'' he added.
``We are a society whose identity is still in a formative phase and
we end up being brought to the ballot box by Americans whose
expertise is in how to divert the attention from the performance of
the leaders they represent.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those directly involved are wary. David Bar-Illan, a
spokesman for Netanyahu who used to write a scathing weekly column
on foreign media coverage of Israel for the Jerusalem Post, is
among them. Even though Netanyahu is credited with starting the
trend, Bar-Illan believes that this time, it works against
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tendency of the American system is to concentrate on
personalities, which does not work to his adavantage,'' explained
Bar-Illan. ``The concentration on policies would be more to his
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Bar-Illan and others are also quick to assign some of the blame
for the downward spiral of political debate to the Israeli media.
Ehud Ya'ari, Israel's top TV political commentator who has also
been a correspondent in Washington, admits the media hold some
resonsibility for getting caught in Finkelstein and Carville's spin
cycles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that Finkelestein and Carville do not understand
the nuances of Israeli politics,'' he said. ``We should be more
vigilant in not allowing them to set the agenda. There is too much
at stake here to let that happen.''

SAFETY A PRIORITY AT NHIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The auto racing world, rocked once again by tragedy, returns to
Loudon, N.H., and the New Hampshire International Speedway this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   NHIS opens its 10th season with a NASCAR Busch Grand National
race and Busch North race Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, three fans watching an Indy Racing League event at
Lowe's Motor Speedway _ formerly Charlotte (N.C.) Motor Speedway _
were killed when a tire and debris from a crash flew off the track,
over a protecting fence, and into the crowd. It was the second such
incident at a major racetrack in less than a year. Last July, three
fans were killed as a result of a similar crash and flying debris
at Michigan Speedway in a CART Indy car race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racing is obviously a dangerous sport, but it shouldn't be
dangerous for folks sitting in the grandstands, that's for sure,''
said Gary Bahre, president of NHIS. ``You should be able to cross
the street downtown and be able to live to tell about it. Freak
things happen every day. But that doesn't make it any more
acceptable. It's a shame, it really is a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   The cars involved in the accidents at Charlotte and Michigan
were open-wheeled Indy race cars.
</P>
<P>
   The NASCAR Busch Grand National and Busch North cars at NHIS
this weekend race at slower speeds, have fenders, and the wheels
are less likely to fly off in a crash. The Indy cars are designed
to break apart upon impact. Breaking apart absorbs the impact from
the crash and helps protect the driver.
</P>
<P>
   Reports out of Charlotte, which is a mile and a half long track
with longer straightaways than NHIS, had the cars going about 210
miles per hour on the straights. Last year, the IRL ran the last of
three races at New Hampshire, and CART had run there several years
before that. The Indy cars went about 185 m.p.h. down the
straightaways at the track, Bahre said.
</P>
<P>
   Bahre and his father, Bob, ended their affiliation with the IRL
last year because they were losing money and had been unable to
increase attendance.
</P>
<P>
   The NASCAR cars this weekend should hit speeds of about 140
m.p.h., Bahre said.
</P>
<P>
   As with Charlotte and other tracks, the racing surface at NHIS
is surrounded by a high catch fence and cement walls. The fence,
Bahre said, is reinforced by a cabling system.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are huge concrete barriers every 300 feet and if a car
gets into the fence, it would spring back,'' Bahre said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been two fatalities at the track. One man was killed
in a go-cart crash and another had a heart attack while racing a
motorcycle, Bahre said. No spectators have been injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``The safety of our guests and folks who work here is
paramount,'' Bahre said. ``We're real comfortable with what we
have, but that's not to say accidents can't happen. They can happen
to anybody at any time. But we are comfortable with the precautions
we've taken here.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup drivers Terry Labonte, Geoff Bodine, Kenny Wallace,
Kevin Lepage, and Johnny Benson are taking advantage of the break
in their schedules to compete in the Busch Grand National race . .
. The Busch Series, the main event, goes off at 12:30, with the
North race to follow . . . Dale Earnhardt Jr. leads the Busch
Series points standings and Matt Kenseth is second. Elton Sawyer,
Jason Keller, and Mike McLaughlin round out the top five . . . Brad
Leighton of Center Harbor, N.H., sits atop the North series point
standings with Tom Carey of Orange, Mass., close behind.

ALICE COOPER BOX SET KEEPS THE HORROR ALIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Capital punishment may be a divisive issue in America, but it
has been very good to Alice Cooper. It's uncertain as to whether
Cooper is a fan or foe, but it's an undeniable fact that capital
punishment has been a big part of his professional life: The singer
has been executed night after night on the concert stages of the
world for more than a quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've been offed in every sort of capital punishment
sort of way you could be,'' says the ever-affable Cooper, often
dubbed the King of Shock Rock, from his home in Phoenix. ``Tens of
thousands of times. I have been electrocuted; I have had my head
cut off; I have been hung. I've been put into a coffin and had
blades put through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gas chamber?
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't done the gas chamber because I couldn't figure out a
way to make it exciting,'' he admits. ``I think you could do lethal
injection if the needle was about 40-feet long and came down from
the ceiling.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper may die for his sins, but he always comes back from the
grave, prancing and preening. ``Always with the best of taste,'' he
adds. His tastefully packaged boxed set _ Alice's face peers out
from behind a prison cell window _ called ``The Life and Crimes of
Alice Cooper,'' a 4-CD, 84-track compilaton on Rhino was recently
released.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent years and years trying to say, `OK, we are a band and
we do theatrics, but we are also a really good band,''' says
Cooper. ``It was hard to convince people of the fact that you could
actually do visuals and music at the same time because they figured
one had to suffer. It's more like giving the audience more rather
than taking away.''
</P>
<P>
   For years _ way before Marilyn Manson, GWAR and Rammstein, all
acts with a bit of Alice in them _ Cooper was viewed by mainstream
America as the epitome of bad taste. And by post-hippie, pre-punk
hard-rock America as the coolest thing going. His music was a rock
'n' roll horror show: visceral, flashy, grotesque, seductive,
gender-bending. Who can forget ``I Love the Dead,'' his ode to
necrophilia? ``I love the dead, before they're cold,'' sang Alice.
``Their bluing flesh for me to hold/Cadaver eyes upon me
see/Nothing.'' Or the plastic dolls, baby and adult, that Cooper
brought on stage to thrash and slash every night.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 51, he's an icon. Cooper, a longtime avid and excellent
(four handicap) golfer, advertises clubs on the golf cable TV
channel. He just opened a rock-n-jock theme restaurant in Phoenix
called Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   On his new CD collection, there are pre-Alice Cooper band songs
with the Nazz and the Spiders. There are hard rock classics from
the glory days _ ``I'm Eighteen,'' ``Ballad of Dwight Frye,''
``Dead Babies,'' ``Be My Lover,'' ``Elected,'' ``Billion Dollar
Babies,'' ``No More Mr. Nice Guy.'' There are smoother hits from
his cruising-into-the-mainstream period _ ``Only Women Bleed,'' ``I
Never Cry'' ``You and Me.'' And there's nearly two discs worth of
post-peak, B-level Cooper from part of the 1980s and '90s. A
portion of the box set liner notes are written by former Sex Pistol
John (Johnny Rotten) Lydon. He praises Cooper's ``gall and
bravery,'' chafes against any who might think the Pistols were the
real thing and Alice Cooper wasn't. ``WRONG!'' Lydon bellows in
print. He tells the story of mimimng to Cooper's ``I'm Eighteen,''
auditioning for Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren. He was hired.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper has a revealing take on why a lot of his stuff during the
early part of era failed to click: demon alcohol. This comes as a
surprise. The early Alice was a well-known boozer, hardly ever seen
without a Budweiser in his hand, but he went through a
much-publicized clean-up and was presumed a sober man.
</P>
<P>
   Here's Cooper's story. He Cooper grew up with self-destructive
hereos like Jim Morrison and Jimi Hendrix _ ``Those guys were kind
of my big brothers,'' he says _ and he emulated what he saw when
the guy born Vincent Furnier created his character Alice Cooper.
``Alcohol was certainly part of the formula of being Alice,'' he
says. ``You want to be notorious and it gets to the point where
`OK, I am notorious, I have proven that. Now, I want to go to the
mall.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper realized his character was getting to be more extreme
than Morrison's or Hendrix's. ``I was going to kill myself if I was
going to try and be this all the time. There was a time where I
finally got self-preservation.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was a relapse. ``I did four albums where I was totally
blacked out,'' Cooper says. ```Flush the Fashion,' `Special
Forces,' `Dada,'' I forget, there's one more (`Constrictor'). Four
in a row I don't remember writing them, recording them. I was in an
absolute alcoholic state.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper explains that after he was hospitalized in the late '70s
was ``sober almost a year'' and then ``went back for a while'' in
1983. He's been sober since.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cooper's music took a swerve toward the mainstream when the
Alice Cooper band disbanded and Cooper set off with other musicians
to make ``Welcome to My Nightmare,'' a concept album, TV special
and tour. Cooper says the band split because the musicians wanted
to work on solo projects and ``on top of that, weren't into the
theatrics anymore. They felt we were past that, and I'm going
`Guys, this is absolutely what we've been waiting for! People are
now trying to look like us. Now is not the time to wear Levis and
t-shirts and try to save the world.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to My Nightmare'' was a commercial hit, but the
two-year tour burned Cooper out and led to his hospitalization.
Subsequently came a creative lull.
</P>
<P>
   But Cooper's metier has always been the stage _ he's toured
through up years and down years _ and that's where he continues to
reign. ``I tour three or four months a year,'' he says, noting a
summer/fall shed tour is highly probable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something comes along that really sounds like a great idea
for a rock 'n' roll album or if something inspires me,'' Cooper
continues, ``I'll make an album. The next album is going to be a
real good rock 'n' roll album, to sort of introduce Alice into the
millennium. Consider: Alice is not old, fat, tired and has lost his
hair. I'm still sleek and have every bit of energy that I ever had.
''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper doesn't have a label currently. He calls himself ``a .300
hitter with power, without a team, a free agent. Every once in a
while I can knock it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper says what's he's planned is another concept album
collaboration with Bob Ezrin. (Ezrin did Cooper's ``Nightmare'' as
well as Pink Floyd's ``The Wall,'' Lou Reed's ``Berlin'' and many
others.) ``It's a concept album,'' Cooper says, ``pretty
classically themed, called `The Seven Deadly''' as in the Seven
Deadly Sins. ``It's pretty much written and I'm working, actually,
with Alan Menken, who wrote all the Disney stuff, `The Little
Mermaid' and all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh no!
</P>
<P>
   Says Alice: ``Somebody else put it together, Rob Ross who did
`The Beauty and the Beast,' and he's the biggest Alice Cooper song
of all time. Alan also did ``Little Shop of Horrors' so I'm
thinking anybody who can write this stuff can write rock 'n' roll.
So I sat down with thte guy and everything the guy writes is a hit,
and when he writes it with me it's really an adventure. He's used
to working with Tim Rice and I'll come in with a lyric and he'll go
`That's cool, very experimental.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``The final thing you gotta remember,'' says Cooper ``is Ezrin.
You gotta remember Ezrin is sicker than me. He is a sick man.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to pick the quintessential Alice Cooper song, Alice Cooper
doesn't hesitate: ``Ballad of Dwight Frye,'' originally on the
``Love It To Death'' album, included on ``The Life and Crimes'' box
set. A gorgeous song that begins softly with acoustic guitar and
piano, it builds into a monstrous, cathartic crescendo with Cooper
_ as the locked-up patient at an insane asylum _ screaming ``I
gotta get out of here! I gotta get out of here! I gotta get out of
here!'' It still holds up today.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper: ``A classic. Probably my most psychologically disturbed
song. Well written, well performed, and I don't know what it is
about the song people realte to, but it's about a character who was
the guy who played Renfield in `Dracula.' He was the guy nobody
ever recognized but was the scariest guy. So we found out his name
and said `Let's put this guy in a straightjacket and, suddenly, it
was Alice. Alice was this guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we actually did the vocal (producer Bob) Ezrin put me in
a straightjacket and said, `Sing your way out of this.' I said `Are
you kidding me?' and he says `Nope' and puts the straightjacket on
and I'm singing in it for six or seven hours. Finally, at the end
when I get to the `I gotta get out of here!' part I actually wasn't
able to get out of the straightjacket. Wow, talk about method
acting.''

MADELEINE ALBRIGHT 
A Twentieth-Century Odyssey 
By Michael Dobbs 
Henry Holt, 466 pp., illustrated, $27.50 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Madeleine Albright tensed up in her first interview with Michael
Dobbs, knowing from subordinates that the Washington Post reporter
would be dropping this bombshell: Did Albright, the devout Roman
Catholic emigrant from Czechoslovakia, know that her family was
Jewish and that her parents concealed their past to survive the
Nazis and prevail in the postwar Czechoslovak government? Did she
know that many of her relatives were killed in the Holocaust?
</P>
<P>
   In digging up background on Albright's Old World roots,
interviewing relatives, visiting gravesites, death camps and old
apartments, Dobbs researched a story that won journalistic awards
and makes up a highly compelling first third of his biography,
``Madeleine Albright: A Twentieth-Century Odyssey,'' which was
excerpted in the New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   But in questioning an uncomfortable Albright about her lost
history, of which she had generally professed ignorance, the
veteran foreign correspondent alienated his best source,
complicating his task as he moved beyond newspaper articles to his
book.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to find a more timely subject to chronicle or a
better time to publish this work. Washington is on battle-footing
in what Dobbs's paper has dubbed ``Albright's War.'' And in seeking
to comprehend the deepening US involvement in the Balkans, it is
useful to understand the Czechoslovak emigrant who rose to become
the US secretary of state. And Dobbs, who has spent years reporting
from Moscow and Belgrade, is comfortable in reporting on her
European roots and the crises that convulsed the region.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbs delivers lyrical, compelling prose, with references to
Franz Kafka, cameos by George Kennan, detailed descriptions of the
Nazi killing machine and F. Scott Fitzgerald quotes in evoking the
Long Island high life of Albright's future relatives by marriage,
Harry Guggenheim and Alicia Patterson. Albright's years at
Wellesley College and as a young wife and mother, a woman too
preoccupied to catch the Sixties rebellion, would contrast with her
later activist career. Dobbs describes her as the prototype of the
``new woman'' heralded by Betty Friedan's ``The Feminine
Mystique.''
</P>
<P>
   Dobbs carefully traces Albright's ascent, as the wife of
newspaper heir Joseph Medill Patterson Albright, as board chief of
a prestigious private school in the shadows of the National
Cathedral, as Democratic fund-raiser, campaign worker,
congressional aide, National Security Council assistant, university
lecturer, foreign policy expert and US ambassador to the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbs traces her steadfast loyalty to a series of mentors and
employers _ Edmund Muskie, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Geraldine Ferraro,
Michael Dukakis and an early favorite at her informal and
policy-oriented Georgetown political salon, Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many sides of Madeleine Albright that it is
difficult to sum them up in a sentence,'' Dobbs writes. ``She can
be both charming and ruthless. She can be extraordinarily kind and
generous but also abrupt, even vindictive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Madeleine Albright'' is a vital guide to understanding the
forces that she fought on her rise _ and the intensity of the
scapegoating and backstabbing of Albright that began in the first
days of this increasingly complicated US-led offensive on Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Albright irritated some Pentagon officials earlier
this decade when she argued, correctly, that limited US force could
ensure peace and stop the killing in Bosnia. Her rivalry with
Balkans troubleshooter Richard Holbrooke is well known. Her rapid,
unorthodox and caste-crashing climb to power _ she is the first
female secretary of state _ has irked Washington's social,
political, and academic Brahmins.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, without significant cooperation from Albright or
some of her close associates, Dobbs raises many potent questions
that linger long after his attempts to answer them. A conclusion
such as this by Dobbs _ ``she can be understood only in the context
of where she came from and the struggle to get to where she is'' _
only deepens curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   Did she, like her father, fashion her faith for survival and
success, converting from Catholicism to Episcopalianism for a
marriage that made her a millionaire, denying her Jewish background
until presented with Dobbs's reportage from Eastern Europe? Or had
her parents successfully obscured her past and Albright never
seriously questioned it?
</P>
<P>
   A broader question, particularly timely in the waning years of
the ethically challenged Clinton administration, also remains: Is
her drive for assimilation, acceptance and success so strong that
it could alter her principles?
</P>
<P>
   It is this point where Dobbs's biography suffers from Albright's
cold shoulder _ and from its publication in the thick of her
career. In a way, Dobbs was cursed with blessings. The very
immediacy that makes this work such a compelling magazine excerpt
and trendy page-turner consigns it to second-rough-draft-of-history
status, its material waiting to be turned over and re-examined
years later by a scholar seeking to realize the promise of a more
comprehensive biography.

'MIRROR' REFLECTS A DULL IMAGE OF HITLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE EMPTY MIRROR 
Directed by: Barry J. Hershey 
Screenplay by: Hershey, R. Buckingham 
Starring: Norman Rodway, Camilla Soeberg, Peter Miochel Goetz, Doug
McKeon, Glenn Shadix, Joel Gray 
Running time: 129 minutes 
Rating: Unrated 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So how did Hitler pass the time in his bunker at the end? It
well may have been that he spent his last hours in bombastic rant.
There is, after all, ample filmed evidence to support the
contention that his natural form of address was the harangue, even
when he was talking to himself, which he mostly does here. But
watching talented British actor Norman Rodway impersonating Hitler
in ``The Empty Mirror'' fills us with no terror or pity or,
unfortunately, much of anything except sympathy for an actor
laboring against great odds. He is largely getting nowhere,
dramatically speaking, even when we get past our initial
impression, after seeing that little streetsweeper mustache on a
face that obviously isn't really Hitler's, that we're about to see
John Cleese do a Monty Python Hitler bit.
</P>
<P>
   As he gazes raptly upon filmed footage of himself, the film's
Hitler keeps raving on about what a master of illusion he is. But
his then-novel skill at image manipulation is now high school
textbook stuff, and does not strike with the force of revelation.
The truth is that we're never convinced for a minute that we're
watching the real Hitler in this labored little psychodrama that
also is unable to bring off its conceit of having pointed questions
posed by the spectre of Sigmund Freud. Joel Gray's Goebbels _ a
more silken version of the serpent-like emcee he payed in
``Cabaret'' _ is wasted, too. And so is the poor actor who's
supposed to be playing the SS trooper, obedient to the end at his
typewriter, following orders, taking dictation from Hitler, however
incoherent it gets as Hitler's mind doesn't so much wander as stall
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Empty Mirror'' is no mirror, but it is empty. It plays
like a stage piece, artificial and claustrophobic, that hasn't been
translated into a film. Even if it were, it would still face
formidable and ultimately overwhelming competition from the real
footage the film uses _ newsreels, Eva Braun's home movies that
remind us of the banality of evil, and Leni Riefenstahl's
still-frightening documentary, ``The Triumph of the Will,'' from
whose massed symmetries Hitler still gets off, arch control freak
that he was. At every turn, the real footage withers the would-be
dramatization, making it seem rudimentary and contrived, even when
it goes for the jugular by switching from vague master race
gassiness to vicious anti-semitic fits. But why bother to fantasize
what might have gone on in Hitler's head if you aren't going to
tell us anything we didn't already know? There's just nothing scary
or cathartic, much less revealing, in ``The Empty Mirror.''

BASEBALL'S SQUEEZE PLAY IS PURE SUICIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only thing missing from Major League Baseball is a tin cup
and monkey. League officials might as well remove the mask of being
America's national pastime and tell the world they are shamelessly
trying to keep up with the Joneses.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the Joneses are the other professional sports,
each flush with new staggering television deals. The most
astounding is the $600 million deal between ESPN and the NHL, one
of the lowest-rated sports on TV.
</P>
<P>
   The deal averages about $120 million per year for the next five
years. ESPN pays Major League Baseball about $40 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Guess who wants a new deal?
</P>
<P>
   Yup, those needy brats at Major League Baseball. They claimed to
be upset about the three games that ESPN wanted to air on ESPN2.
They whined about ``being forgotten'' by ESPN. But the real deal is
that they wanted ESPN to fork over $350 million for a new contract.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, last season's home run chase was great for the sport.
It doesn't mean baseball has the ratings muscle to command a
gigantic increase in rights fees.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, baseball has earned a 1.3-rating average on
ESPN. That's pathetic for the so-called national paastime. As ESPN
vice president Dick Glover said, the NFL is the gold standard for
television ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, baseball was decimated by the players' strike.
The game's popularity was low and it took Sammy Sosa and Mark
McGwire to put a little strut back in the sport. All of that good
will was erased when Major League baseball tried to terminate its
deal with ESPN, its partner of the last decade. The contract was
scheduled to end in 2002, and, as a result, ESPN has filed suit for
breach of contract.
</P>
<P>
   As ESPN explains the story, Major League Baseball was upset over
switching three games to ESPN2 to air NFL games.
</P>
<P>
   They have a point. ESPN has 76.2 million subscribers; ESPN2 has
64.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   According to ESPN, Major League Baseball agreed to allow ESPN to
pre-empt as many as 10 games for ``events of significant viewer
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, ESPN has bumped baseball games to show auto racing,
NHL playoffs, golf, World Cup soccer, the College World Series, and
NFL games. Until now, baseball approved of each of those events.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Major League Baseball is miffed that ESPN decided to
bump games to earn higher ratings with the NFL. The feud came to a
head April 21 when ESPN received a letter from Major League
baseball's chief operating officer Paul Beeston terminating their
contract at the end of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball needs to understand some new economic realities. For
one thing, it signed an agreement through 2002. It signed that
extension in 1997 when the sport's popularity was at an all-time
low. That's not ESPN's problem. Nor does ESPN have to worry about
Major League Baseball's agreement with Fox and NBC, both of which
expire in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   It would be better for baseball if all of its television
contracts expired at the same time in order to negoitiate a better
deal. But they don't.
</P>
<P>
   And to try to make up any old reason to end its contract with
ESPN is preposterous, especially considering that baseball games in
September are the lowest rated of the regular season. Last year,
September games received a 1.7 rating on ESPN; the three NFL games
earned a 7.3 average.
</P>
<P>
   It's not about the nine hours of programming.
</P>
<P>
   It's about baseball standing up for its right to squeeze a few
more nickels out of a network.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder baseball doesn't have anything to say when the
Fox-owned Dodgers sign Kevin Brown for $90 million or the
Disney-owned Anaheim Angels spend $80 million for Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   They are trying to get some of that television money as well.
Its the American way, trying to get something for nothing.
</P>

   The NBA and Radio Unica signed a deal to allow the Spanish radio

WHITHER THE DECENT MONSTER FLICK? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Horror films used to be terrifying. Monsters used to be
mysteries. And movies used to be more than an excuse for insensate
violence and gruesome special effects, 90 percent of which are
aimed straight at the gag reflex.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this is a nostalgic rant, but the folks who made ``The
Mummy'' are asking for it. Any remake of a 1932 horror classic
starring Boris Karloff as a 3,700-year-old dead guy demands
comparison with the original _ and with the later Christopher Lee
version, released in 1959 by that venerable cheese factory, Hammer
Films. The Hammer version is the nastier of the two, but both are
gripping tales with moody settings and slowly mounting suspense.
And they're both _ ready for this? _ scary.
</P>
<P>
   The new one isn't. Written and directed by Stephen Sommers
(``Deep Rising''), ``The Mummy'' is less a horror film than a
frenzied hybrid of ``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' and the ``Alien''
sequels, a bloated gross-o-rama that mistakes jokiness for humor,
action for excitement and violence for bona fide chills.
</P>
<P>
   It's a prime example of what happens when the urge to show off
(look, Ma, new computer gimmicks!) overwhelms the urge to tell a
story. Filmmakers don't care about spooking us any longer; they
want to make us retch.
</P>
<P>
   The elements are familiar: 3,289 years ago, a high priest named
Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) canoodled with the Pharaoh's mistress.
Unfortunately, Pharaoh discovered them in flagrante delicto they
stabbed him to death, after which the mistress was executed, after
which Imhotep tried to revive her with a blasphemous prayer from
The Book of the Dead (no relation to Tibet).
</P>
<P>
   Pharaoh's guards stopped him, cut out his tongue, wrapped him in
linen and entombed him alive in a secret compartment alongside his
mummified lover. There he remained, bearing a curse for anyone who
dared open the vault.
</P>
<P>
   Skip ahead a few years, to 1923. The French Foreign Legion is
battling an army of fierce Egyptians sworn to protect Hamunaptra,
the elaborate underground ``city of the dead'' where Imhotep nurses
his curse. One of the legionnaires is a smart-aleck American named
O'Connell (Brendan Fraser, trying hard), who gets a whiff of evil
when the sand around him rises into the shape of a mummy's face.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Connell escapes, and before long he's chaperoning a
feisty, klutzy English librarian (Rachel Weisz) and her no-goodnik
brother (John Hannah) back to Imhotep's resting place in hopes of
finding a royal stash. Along the way they bump into a bunch of
treasure-seeking Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Oops, the Americans wake up the mummy. And oops, the roused
mummy embarks on a maiming-and-killing spree of astonishing range
and computer-generated ingenuity, plucking organs from the unlucky
explorers and sucking the juice out of them like milkshakes through
a straw. In a bold stroke, he also inflicts upon humanity the
plagues of Egypt. Imhotep: demon mummy from hell.
</P>
<P>
   Bits of this are entertaining. The first 20 minutes (the
ancient-Egypt flashbacks and legionnaire battle scenes) are
magnificently conceived and staged, and the mummy itself is an
amazing feat of animation. But Sommers doesn't know when to end it:
He piles on the visual showstoppers until the entire thing is a
nonstop parade of disfigurements, dismemberments, exposed entrails,
gouged eyes, rotting faces and skin-burrowing beetles reminiscent
of ``The Matrix.'' Keep in mind, this is a film in which the
mum-man's one kissing scene is cut short when his face starts to
decompose.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the trouble is modern Hollywood's tendency to inflate
everything, from budgets to body counts to the producers'
blimp-size egos. The running time is inflated from 72 minutes to
two hours plus. The tomb is inflated into a subterranean metropolis
with chasmal, jewel-filled crypts. Suspense is inflated into
flat-out shock, ignoring Hitchcock's old dictum that waiting for a
bomb to go off is vastly more interesting than watching it explode.
</P>
<P>
   And the mummy? He's inflated, too _ from a walking Band-Aid into
a flesh-eating, viscera-spewing, sandstorm-blowing, semi-decayed
corpse who growls like a T-Rex and slings swarms of locusts onto
the streets of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think is out there?'' asks Weisz. ``In a word:
evil,'' says Fraser, doing John Wayne one second, Clint Eastwood
the next.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser is well cast for this sort of thing; he has a natural
goofiness that offsets the movie's abundant gore. Sommers' jocular
script is alternately punchy and trite, including a few profoundly
racist cracks about an Egyptian guide's body odor. It's all a big
joke, you see _ a far cry from the deadly earnest monster films of
yore, when manly men with British accents saved well-coiffed
damsels from lumbering ghouls.
</P>
<P>
   The men are still manly, the damsels still coiffed, but no one
takes the ghouls too seriously these days. Terror in the splatter
era is by definition comic: Even the most gruesome (and genuinely
frightening) examples, like ``Evil Dead 2'' or ``Scream,'' mix
irony in with the blood.
</P>
<P>
   That's what ``The Mummy'' aims for, and that's where it fails.
By emphasizing waggish, nonstop violence over a cool, slow scare,
Sommers and company have made a film as eager to please as it is
fatiguing. Is it revolting? Yes. Is it fun? Now and then. But is it
horror? Not even close.

EVERYONE WINS THIS `ELECTION' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
ELECTION 
Directed by: Alexander Payne 
Screenplay by: Payne, Jim Taylor (novel: Tom Perrotta) 
Starring: Matthew Broderick, Reese Witherspoon, Chris Klein, Phil
Reeves, Mark Harelik, Delaney Driscoll, Molly Hagan, Colleen Camp,
Jessica Campbell, Frankie Ingrassia 
Running time: 103 minutes 
Rated: R (strong sexuality, sex-related dialogue and language, and
a scene of drug use) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Election'' is an invigoratingly mordant comedy that proves
that Alexander Payne's rambunctious debut, ``Citizen Ruth,'' was no
fluke. That film pivoted on Laura Dern's far from model citizen and
her fight to avoid being turned into an abortion pawn. This one is
driven by Reese Witherspoon's high school overachiever wh is too
much of a perfect citizen for her well-intended civics teacher's
comfort. You've got to laugh at Witherspoon's tightly wound Little
Miss Perfect, rising at dawn to do her hair and encase herself in a
preppy look before baking cupcakes to pass out at school as
vote-getters in her campaign for student council president.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Flick is the name of this Stepford Candidate. It's a name
that goes with her hard, snappy manner and the don't-mess-with-me
look behind her frighteningly synthetic cheeriness. The message,
written in icing on top of those cupcakes, is Pick Flick. The
unwritten message is: Look out if you don't. Matthew Broderick's
teacher, afraid of her relentlessness, thinks maybe it would be
better for everybody if she were stopped. So he talks a popular
jock with a disarmingly modest manner into running against her.
That turns the life of the jock's sister upside down when her
bisexual girlfriend dumps her and begins chasing her brother
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Campbell's angry and jilted outsider, alienated to begin
with, jumps into the race as a third party candidate, promising to
abolish the student council altogether if elected. Drawing upon Tom
Perrotta's novel inspired by the three-way 1992 presidential
election and a high school principal's attempt to nullify the
election of a pregnant prom queen, Payne boldly weaves a morality
tale peopled by spineless administrators, sexually wayward teachers
and merciless students. As he did in ``Citizen Ruth,'' he convinces
us that there's something rotten in Omaha, his hometown, and, by
extension, everywhere. By the time he's finished, there's smoke
coming off the screen as well as laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Following the dictum that no good deed goes unpunished,
Broderick's earnest teacher finds himself paying dearly for daring
to cross Witherspoon's steely Tracy. But part of his undoing is his
involvement with the wife of a colleague fired for having sex with
a student. To Payne's credit, the characters in ``Election'' aren't
wholly virtuous or villainous. Broderick's teacher is as much a
victim of boredom and marital dissatisfaction as he is of Tracy.
And there's something touchingly vulnerable in Tracy's enslavement
by her own ambition. Without hitting the point too hard,
Witherspoon makes clear that there's something pitiable about
Tracy's compensation for her own feelings of inadequacy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that doesn't mean she can't do considerable damage. But
then nobody is very nobly motivated in the seamy little microcosm
on view here. These days, it doesn't take much to float a black
comedy view of high school, and ``Election'' accomplishes this with
Swiftian brilliance. In fact, the film's most sympathetic
characters aren't Witherspoon's rigid little success machine or
Broderick's nice guy about to self-destruct on a midlife crisis.
They're Chris Klein's charmingly affable jock and Campbell, as his
understandably angry and bracingly honest sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Election' is the scalding morality fable it is because it
never falls into the trap of dividing the world between caricatures
of good and bad. It proceeds from an essentially pessimistic view
of human nature. Its performances achieve the impact they do
because Broderick makes contact with a good man's tragic flaw and
Witherspoon tempers her fury with a sense that she works as hard as
she does partly to avoid confronting her own inner emptiness.
``Election'' is a natural running mate to the decade's other
exceptional high school movie, ``Rushmore.'' It's as original, and
has sharper teeth.

WILLIAMS SOARS ON NEW SCORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Lucas and Steven Spielberg can sing all of John
Williams's main themes from the ``Star Wars'' trilogy. In that
respect, they are scarcely unique _ probably most Americans under
the age of 50 can duplicate the feat. The original ``Star Wars'' LP
outsold every other soundtrack album in history _ and every
orchestral recording ever made _ and it's likely to leave last
year's ``Titanic'' behind in a cloud of Pod-racer exhaust.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just in advance of the eagerly-awaited release of ``Episode
I _ The Phantom Menace,'' &UR;  &LR; Sony has delivered Williams's new CD to
the stores. It's a stirring and far-reaching score, one of the most
ambitious that Williams has ever crafted. In it one can hear the 20
years of additional experience in composing, recording, and
conducting his music and that of others that Williams brought to
this task. Some of the thematic material is familiar _ he could
hardly avoid the ``Star Wars'' main title _ but there is a lot of
entirely new music, and some of it transcends generic categories.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there is billowing flight music sweeping across galaxies;
jagged fight music; whirring infernal-machine chase music; striding
marches of nobly resolute character and marches of heavy and
sinister tread; there's a whimsical novelty bit, ``Augie's Great
Municipal Band,'' with children's chorus and police whistles, that
reminds us of Williams's deft cabaret parody in the original ``Star
Wars.'' The harp is repeatedly used to add a touch of mystery and
wonder. But there are also many new colors in this score, which
features a prominent role for the chorus for the first time (London
Voices joining the London Symphony Orchestra, which has performed
throughout the series), and an equally prominent part for
synthesizer, which contributes some chilling otherworldly touches
and a few slices of the light sabre too.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking passage may be the second track, ``Duel of the
Fates,'' for chorus and orchestra, which comes back in the end
credits _ a battle between the forces of good and evil turned into
a violently rhythmical pagan ritual; Stravinsky lurks in the
background. The text Williams found in an old Celtic poem
translated into English by Robert Graves in ``The White Goddess'';
Williams had it translated into a number of ancient languages, and
chose Sanskrit because he loved the vowels. Another key passage is
``Anakin's Theme,'' depicting the child-hero of the film _ the
figure who will grow up during the next two films and cross over to
the Dark Side and become Darth Vader. A melody of innocence spins
out over a gently flowing accompaniment; the whole thing is so
attractive we almost don't notice how unstable it is harmonically,
and how underneath and within it the familiar theme of Darth Vader
is threatening to take over.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner wrote the librettos for his ``Ring'' cycle backwards,
adding the ``back story'' that would make sense of ``Siegfried''
and ``Die Gotterdammerung'' But Wagner had the advantage of writing
the music in order, and of knowing he was composing a vast,
unprecedented cycle of works. Williams has had to work backwards,
so among other things, his score is a triumph of professional and
imaginative craftsmanship. It is also remarkably fluid; Williams
knows how to change musical character within a few beats, and how
to develop themes and interweave them to achieve an emotional
complexity that matches the way Lucas's primal images recur
throughout the films, assembling and reassembling in the memory,
and accruing a different resonance every time.
</P>
<P>
   The principal new novelty character, Jar-Jar Binks, is likely to
prove as controversial as the Ewoks in ``The Return of the Jedi''
did. Jar-Jar is there for the kids, and the ``Star Wars'' junkies
are going to grow impatient with him. Williams may help win people
over with his music, the way he made the audience fall in love with
Princess Leia even though Carrie Fisher didn't make it easy. For
Jar-Jar, Williams has fashioned a charming lopsided theme,
captivatingly orchestrated, that sounds like an extra ``Enigma''
variation from Elgar. The English composer, Williams's favorite,
also influences the noble music for the death and funeral of the
Jedi knight Qui-Gon (Liam Neeson).
</P>
<P>
   Williams's music is unabashedly and affectionately derivative of
music the composer loves _ Prokofiev as well as Elgar _ and
including the film music of ``golden age'' composers like Erich
Wolfgang Korngold and Miklos Rozsa, to which he pays conscious
homage. In this, the music parallels the films, which are an
anthology of themes from ancient and Wagnerian epics, comic books,
serials, and old movies. After all, the opening scroll firmly
places the action in the distant past, not in the future (``A long
time ago, in a galaxy far, far away''). Out of his sources, George
Lucas created a personal synthesis that is original, and Williams's
music is original too. Listening, in advance of actually seeing the
movie, one can nevertheless clearly hear the story that is
unfolding, and the emotional resonances that it unleashes.
</P>
<P>
   In the album, Lucas writes a brief tribute to Williams. ``John
had to draw upon the signature themes while creating a new, if
somehow familiar, musical galaxy. And he had to visit new emotional
territory in Episode 1. His music had to help tell the story of a
pacifist Queen who confronts the need to fight for the survival of
her people, a mother who must give up her son that he might achieve
his true potential, and noble Jedi faced with the rise of an
unimaginable. Once again, John has exceeded my expecations and
produced a lavish, rich, moving and thrilling score. Every fan of
`Star Wars' _ and of great music is in his debt.'' What lingers in
the memory after hearing the music to ``The Phantom Menace'' is not
bombast and outsize heroics but the richness of emotional texture _
this is a score that only John Williams could have written, and
that John Williams probably couldn't have written 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's presentation leaves a lot to be desired. The CD does not
present the complete score, which means that fans will have to buy
another album at some future point (just as they did with the
earlier films in the series). The annotation is skimpy _ no text or
translation for the choral episodes _ and it is printed in sepia
type on a yellow-orange background that is almost impossible to
read. The sticker on the box promises that the leaflet will unfold
into a poster, and so it does, if your idea of a poster is about
the size of a Sunday bulletin in church, 19 by 14 inches. This may
be the only thing about ``Star Wars'' that isn't outsize.

`WINSLOW BOY' A SOBERING LOOK AT THE HIGH COST OF JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE WINSLOW BOY 
Directed and written by: David Mamet, based on Terence Rattigan's
play) 
Starring: Nigel Hawthorne, Jeremy Northam, Rebecca Pidgeon, Gemma
Jones, Guy Edwards, Matthew Pidgeon, Colin Stinton, Aden Gilette,
Sarah Flind, Neil North 
Running time: 110 minutes 
Rated: G 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The name of David Mamet would not be the first to spring to mind
as the one to update ``The Winslow Boy,'' Terence Rattigan's
portrait of British justice celebrating its own oaken decency. But
it works beautifully on several levels. In some ways, Mamet's new
film even exceeds the fine 1950 film of Rattigan's 1946 play. Nor
is it the leap it might at first seem for Mamet. His reputation as
a writer rests on the words he puts in the mouths of American
lowlifes. But his writing has always been exquisitely precise and
chiseled, and it's easy to see how the equally lapidary writing of
Rattigan would appeal to him. The important point in all this is
that they are soulmates linked by a passion for crafting spoken
lines, however different they may be in other respects.
</P>
<P>
   The calibration of passions in Mamet's take on ``The Winslow
Boy'' is as keenly gauged as anything in any of the recent Jane
Austen films. And there are passions. Foremost, the simple but
profound passion for right. It's not difficult to see, beneath the
play's Edwardian carapace, how subversive Rattigan's play was. It
zeroed in on a cause celebre of the time, the expulsion of a naval
cadet accused of stealing a five-shilling postal note, and the
one-sidedness of it because under the law the boy's parents had no
way of clearing their son, whom they believed innocent. Because,
legally speaking, the naval academy and by extension the king could
do no wrong, the Winslows' recourse is limited. There is a
loophole, but the odds are against them slipping through it.
</P>
<P>
   Which of course makes the struggle more dramatic and noble.
Nigel Hawthorne as the elder Winslow, respectable and financially
comfortable enough to enjoy societal perks as a retired bank
manager, although not really wealthy, is the film's center of
gravity. Although an initially forbidding patriarch, he softens in
his moments with his young son, whom he believes enough to gamble
everything on clearing his name, even to the point of exhausting
his family's security and his own health. He's stern, but loving
and humane, a believable incarnation of moral passion. It's an
underplayed performance of silken delicacy and inner ruggedness,
the kind for which awards were invented.
</P>
<P>
   He's not alone. In addition to knowing how to alter the original
(mostly, he pares), Mamet in his sixth film continues to grow and
deepen as a director of actors. He impressively orchestrates the
largely unspoken but increasingly eloquent duet between Rebecca
Pidgeon as the Winslow boy's suffragette sister and Jeremy Northam
as the taciturn but brilliant lawyer the family engages to defend
and exonerate him. Mamet encourages them to express what lies
between the lines, and they do so satisfyingly, merging the high
passions they attach to their respective callings with their more
reserved personal lives.
</P>
<P>
   Visually, Mamet gives us a world bathed in a grave clarity and
somber light, analogue to its moral climate. There's nothing
nostalgic or celebratory about it. Clearly, it's a world rumbling
with change and it requires strength to negotiate. The film
craftily puts the focus on the economic, social, emnotional, and
physical drain the case puts on the family. If the elder Winslow is
visibly aged and walking on canes as the case drags on, wondering
if he hasn't been more motivated by destructive pride than by a
search for justice, Pidgeon's wan, pale visage convincingly
reflects the erosion of her hitherto undentable resolve. That we
see the cost of fighting for justice is what's so touching here. In
a world where nothing comes easily, justice certainly doesn't. In
the film's muted style lies its own integrity and its own success.

`PHANTOM' SETS NET ABUZZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Force is out, and the reviews are, well, lukewarm to
glowing.
</P>
<P>
   In case you live in a non-Jedi universe, the reviews in question
concern ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' the
long-awaited prequel to George Lucas's wildly popular trilogy. Ever
since the film was screened Tuesday night for industry types at
``private'' sneak previews in eight cities the Internet has been
abuzz with advance word. Thursday afternoon it was nearly
impossible to gain access to many of the popular movie gossip
sites, which were overloaded with hits. Some of the headlines on
reviews posted at www.ain't-it-cool-news.com, the site run by cyber
renegade Harry Knowles, ranged from hesitant pans like ``Er'' and
``D'oh'' to enthusiastic raves like ``WOW'' and ``Yeah, baby!''
</P>
<P>
   Industry insiders are usually reserved about such advance
screenings, but the general consensus on line was that the film
doesn't disappoint when it comes to the wow factor. The special
effects were ``mind-boggling,'' according to Wired News. Ditto for
the costumes and cinematography.
</P>
<P>
   But insiders differed on their view of the characters and the
story. The anonymous Wired report claimed, without a touch of
irony, ``The story is the weakest aspect of the film.'' Daily
Variety reported that the New York audience ``was ready to embrace
the film but never did.'' The Hollywood Reporter praised the film
as kid-friendly, but other reviewers complained that it was aimed
too heavily at children instead of adults.
</P>
<P>
   In short, every ``Er'' was countered by a ``Wow.'' Without
giving away any secrets, here are some of the key points.
</P>
<P>
   --Acting: Some folks had less than positive things to say about
Jake Lloyd, the boy who plays 10-year-old Anakin Skywalker (a.k.a.
Darth Vader). But a reviewer who calls himself Sithslayer who saw
the film in Detroit and wrote about it on ain't-it-cool-news begged
to differ: ``He was fantastic,'' he cooed. Most folks agreed that
the malicious Darth Maul was sufficiently evil, but some wanted to
see more of him while others thought he was too scary for younger
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   --Jar Jar Binks, the computer-generated cuddly character, was
described as adorable for the kiddies but annoying (and cloying)
for grown-ups. ``What's up with the Jamaican accent?'' one reviewer
wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   --The special effects, most sneak-preview attendees agreed, are
as good as they get, especially when they're generated by the
legendary Industrial Light and Magic.
</P>
<P>
   No matter which way the thumb points, the film is still expected
to rake in about $400 million in domestic ticket sales after it
opens officially on May 19. What do you expect from a film that has
fans camping out on street corners to buy tickets and lining up at
toy stores to buy trinkets at midnight?
</P>
<P>
   The on-line fan sites have been gearing up for the opening for
more than a year, posting the tiniest tidbits of information about
the upcoming release. But for the most part, the fans didn't manage
to sneak into the advance screening, which is creating contention
among some diehard enthusiasts. ``The problem is that these reviews
are not coming from fans, they're coming from industry types,''
says Steve Head, a Weymouth real estate professional and a
contributor to TheForce.net fan site. ``Positive reviews would have
filtered out if the fans had been let in.'' All in good time.

FARMER TURNS EXCESS GOAT MILK INTO NATURAL SOAPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By H.E. MacDONALD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ You probably won't come across this goat-milk
soap in a chain supermarket or drugstore. But according to one goat
farmer who makes it, the product is drawing interest _ and
customers _ from all across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to get away from commercial products,'' said
Dottie Cross, owner of Capri-Dot's Nubians, a dairy goat farm in
Rensselaer County, N.Y.. ``I think it's a growing trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Cross has found a new and potentially profitable niche in skin
care. She began making Capri-Suds goat milk soap about a year ago,
hoping to find a good use for her herd's excess milk. Since then,
she has attracted a customer base that includes a 4-H club, a Long
Island health food store, a church in Rochester, N.Y., and an Ohio
candle shop. She also makes goat milk shampoo bars.
</P>
<P>
   Goat milk soap isn't such an unusual idea _ milk baths go back
to the days of the ancient Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
   Cross came up with her original recipe through trial and error,
research on the Internet and contacting other soap makers. Each bar
contains about an ounce of milk along with olive oil, palm oil,
coconut oil and other natural ingredients, including glycerin, a
good-for-your-skin byproduct often removed from commercial soap.
The mixture is poured into a mold and frozen. After about 24 hours,
the soap bars _ embossed with a figure of a Nubian goat _ are
removed, dried and ready to sell.
</P>
<P>
   The soap comes in over 20 different fragrances, including
vanilla musk, cucumber, milk 'n honey, orange blossom, spicy lime,
peaches 'n cream, apple blossom and one scent with a racy name _
naked ladies.
</P>
<P>
   Cross named the product Capri-Suds to establish a link between
the soap and her herd. Also, capri goat.
</P>
<P>
   So far, sales have varied widely. Cross says she makes about 60
bars each week and doesn't plan to build up too large an inventory.
At this point, she sometimes goes a few weeks between sales, then
might receive an order for 32 bars at once. At $2.50 to $3 per bar,
Capri-Suds bars are competitive with the $4 bar of goat milk soap
sold at specialty shops.
</P>
<P>
   Cross currently markets her soaps on the Internet at
www.enaturalmall.com, an on-line natural products shop, and
www.simplerway.com, a craft fair site. She plans to create a Web
site of her own to promote the farm as well as Capri-Suds. She also
may develop goat milk soap for animals that will include citronella
to repel fleas.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Capri-Suds portion of Cross' business is small
compared to the breeding and selling of dairy goats, which keeps
her busy and close to home. However, she hopes to do more business
with Capri-Suds by selling wholesale to stores and reaching out to
customers herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream is to have a mail-order business from the house,''
she said.

 &HT;    WOMEN LESS LIKELY TO BE MOTHERS THAN IN THE PAST
 &HT;    For release Sunday, May 9.
 &HT;    By SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ American women are less likely to be mothers than a
generation ago, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and those who
are mothers have fewer children and go back to work sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, two out of five women of child-bearing age won't be
celebrating Mother's Day. According to the latest Census Bureau
statistics, 42 percent of women aged 15 to 44 were childless in
1995. That's up from 35 percent in 1976, the first year such
figures were available.
</P>
<P>
   Women who do become mothers have fewer children, the census data
shows. In 1995, the average mother had 1.2 children, down from 2.0
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``This data might possibly indicate that women have better
access to contraception and are making different life choices than
in 1976,'' said Diane Bell, director of the George Washington
University Women's Studies program.
</P>
<P>
   Today's mother is more likely to work outside the home during
the first year of their child's life than a generation ago. More
than 55 percent of women who had a child in 1994 went to work
within a year, up from 31 percent in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women can't afford not to return to work,'' said Karen
Johnson, vice president of membership for the National Organization
of Women. ``We are seeing that more and more families have to
become two-income families.''
</P>
<P>
   The census data also showed that older women were more likely to
work sooner than younger women. Among women having a first child,
77 percent of those 30 to 44 went back to work in the following
year, compared to 72 percent of women 25 to 29, 63 percent of women
20 to 24, and 43 percent of women 15 to 19.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau report for 1995 recorded 60.2 million women
between 15 and 44 years of age. Of these women, there were 35
million mothers and nearly 3.7 million births within the year.
</P>
<P>
   The District of Columbia had the most childless women, with 55.4
percent, followed by Massachusetts with 51 percent. The states with
the lowest percentages of women without children were Arkansas,
with 34.8 percent, and Wyoming, with 35.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of unwed mothers has also risen. In 1995, of the
22.8 million women who had never been married, 21 percent had given
birth to at least one child. Just five years earlier, 18 percent of
the 20.7 million mothers had never been married.
</P>
<P>
   While the majority of mothers in 1995 were adults, 800,000 teens
aged 15 to 19 were mothers, up from 450,000 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``Families are changing, and the only question is whether it
will be for the better or for worse.'' said Johnson.

MEDEM FILM IS THE `DIE HARD' OF LOVE STORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Julio Medem's ``Lovers of the Arctic Circle'' has the potent
detailed beauty of an autumn gale in which the leaves do a slo-mo
blow-by and the raindrops seem to need parachutes to descend. It's
sopping wet with involving comeliness and its action divinely
telegraphed.
</P>
<P>
   But it's easier to get inside one of those little wintry snow
domes than to access Medem's star-crossed love saga.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Lovers'' has a similarly hypnotic arrangement in which
everything has been situated just so. Medem constructs a world with
the surgical meticulousness it takes to build a ship in a bottle _
and the effect is just as how'd-he-do-that mysterious, and just as
synthesized. Not in the way a film-by-committee would be but in
that grand experimental way most writer-directors ruin in the
execution. Medem earns the unique distinction of having made one of
the greatest love stories never felt.
</P>
<P>
   Photographed by Kalo F. Berri with exceeding vibrancy,
``Lovers'' is the ballad of two people meant to be together. But
you know this only because the refrain is ``we were meant to be
together.'' Otto and Ana, the film's lifelong paramours played in
three stages of life by six different actors, live in a state of
irony that Medem concocts to bring them together then drive apart,
with the constant ebb and flow of complication, coincidence or
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The moment young Otto (Peru Medem) sees young Ana (Sara
Valiente), he knows they were meant to be together, and when he's
unsure, she isn't. The film see-saws between each other's memory _
told in chapters _ of the evolution of their mutual intoxication.
</P>
<P>
   Medem would have you believe the two were born in love. Through
a gracefully imagined series of happy accidents and bizarre
tragedies, Otto's father (Nancho Novo) remarries Ana's mother (Maru
Valdivielso), and brother and sister discover the joys of each
other's sex, in secret as a gaggle of jokes only we're let in on.
</P>
<P>
   Medem, in fact, makes us privy to everything we need to know
about Otto and Ana without allowing them to do more than dangle
from the strings attached to his agile screenwriting like a
marionette rendition of ``Romeo and Juliet,'' or an Isabelle
Allende version that goes easy on the history and politics. Medem
fancies himself a magic-realist, and he is. He's also an emotional
illusionist who makes you think you're experiencing something when
you're not.
</P>
<P>
   His script is too rich to start giving it away. But it has the
hocus-pocus velocity of a roller coaster cum tunnel of love, ending
where it began, suffocatingly self-contained like Otto and Ana's
palindromic names. And the story seems told on levers and pulleys
as though it were a Rube Goldberg love story, in which Alberto
Iglesias' soaring, inflamed score and each of the fantastic
performances _ particularly Valiente and Najwa Nimri, who plays Ana
as a drifting love-sick adult, looking alternately like Winona
Ryder and Natalie Wood _ are so beautifully windswept but airtight
that no one seems to breath organic air. This may be the ``Die
Hard'' of love stories: so much adrenalized pulchritude your heart
barely feels a thing.

TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE KOSOVO WAR

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Please, somebody, explain this Kosovo thing to
me.
</P>
<P>
   I've watched the news, clicked on background stories on the
Internet, and I still don't get it. I know it's more than a
``Gulliver's Travels'' tale _ a war over cracking soft-boiled eggs
at the pointed end or the fat end. And yet, as I watch the six
o'clock news, the people involved look pretty much the same to me.
And I wonder: How do the bad guys even know who to shoot?
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help that I can't even get the name of the country
straight. It's not Yugoslavia, but it used to be Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is not a state, but it looks like one on the map with its
solid yellow border. The region. The Balkans. The Albanians. The
ethnic Albanians. The conflict. The war? Could it happen here? What
if a private army bankrolled by the Haas family (forgive me,
darling, civic-minded Haases), decided to run all the folks who
quit wearing Levi's button-fly 501's out of San Francisco?
</P>
<P>
   What if soldiers wearing rasping, hard jeans marched half the
people of San Francisco across the Golden Gate Bridge in their
Diesels, VC and Arizona jeans to camps dotting the Marin Headlands?
</P>
<P>
   It's cold up there overlooking the bridge, you know.
</P>
<P>
   Cold and wet. There is no shelter, no water, no sanitation.
You'd have to go to the bathroom in front of thousands of
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   If it happened here, Apache helicopters and guided missiles
couldn't be used because the concentrated cellular phone use would
jam all frequencies. And whom would everyone be calling? Their own
voice mail, of course. To check for messages because we're all so
damned important. The traffic would eventually crash the system,
forcing folks to actually walk around and look for loved ones. And
we'd all need our own personal covey of friends and family nearby,
because tomorrow _ off to Norway!
</P>
<P>
   Don't panic. I've heard Norway is lovely in the spring. The
goats, the Gruyere, the 100-proof glug. And it's one of those
countries you never get to. France. Italy. Greece. They get all the
vacation action. But in this special circumstance, you've won a
lottery ticket for Norway and that's OK. The women are pretty,
right? Socialized medicine, right? They probably have really,
really nice refugee camps. Scandinavian furniture, I bet.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that smelt is their main source of protein. Think of
the calcium. And you'll get used to only three hours of sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   So, that's the ticket. Look on the bright side. You didn't want
to finish that Y2K project at work anyway. And truth be told, even
if you had rent control, you were pretty sick of that dingy little
apartment, weren't you? And who really needs pets, anyway? Let the
Levi's people turn San Francisco into a pure, jack-booted,
lock-stepped 501 city. Who cares if they sponsor sporting events at
the Oakland Coliseum? People who wear Lee jeans deserve to be fed
to the lions and televised live on Fox TV.
</P>
<P>
   So, relax. it's just a conflict. When you get to Norway, they'll
let you eat your soft-boiled eggs from whichever end you choose.

HIGH SCHOOLS ARE HOTBEDS OF EXCLUSION

   Commentary

<P>
   SEDONA, Ariz. _ How many alienated youth are out there? I
suspect that many are quietly simmering in the shadows of the
gruesome headlines from Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were alienated young men. But what
was their problem? Alienation is a social disease, not something
you ``catch'' like the flu. Alienation is something people do to
each other.
</P>
<P>
   For often rather shallow reasons, people selectively ignore
other people. They reject. They exclude. They alienate.
</P>
<P>
   Being denied or excluded from parental love is undoubtedly the
most destructive form of alienation. But as Hollingshead and later
James Coleman wrote in their celebrated studies of American youth,
adolescents in this culture wage an active campaign of exclusion
and status one-upmanship within their peer society.
</P>
<P>
   Bullying by one's peers, if it occurs regularly throughout one's
middle and high school years, can take a toll.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the bullying is a value system that establishes who
warrants exclusion and why.
</P>
<P>
   The murderous outcasts in Littleton targeted school ``jocks,''
who other students said had been targeting them for months, maybe
years. Having come of age in an American high school, I remember
the envy and isolation that accompanied my being less competitively
athletic than I thought I should have been.
</P>
<P>
   I got good grades, yet to really attract the good graces of
students and teachers, I felt I would have had to be first-string
on the football team, or at least visibly involved in some
competitive sport. (That I was on the tennis team didn't seem to
count.) Being in school was an alienating experience on a daily
basis, even though I cannot remember anyone ever overtly hassling
me. Since I had internalized the value system, I hassled myself.
</P>
<P>
   Jocks seemed to enjoy more of everything: more information,
privileges, attention from teachers, career advice, interpersonal
intimacy in the school. I didn't feel resentful so much as
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   A value system that promotes ranking results in the labeling of
``cool'' and ``uncool'' students. These values are more pervasive
than any single instance of bullying on school grounds. We don't
think of schools as places where kids come to believe that there is
something fundamentally ``uncool'' or deficient about them, but
schools often are.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't have to be the case, and in many school systems
overseas _ in Asia for example _ schools are places where students
are intentionally shielded from the status differences that pervade
society beyond school walls.
</P>
<P>
   School officials in Japan and China require school uniforms as
one means to equalize the disparate backgrounds of students.
</P>
<P>
   In other ways as well, students are actively prevented from
reveling in their differences, either as groups or as individuals.
</P>
<P>
   We cannot reinvent American schools, but we can learn from other
societies that recognize the insidious results of allowing the
social distinctions which pervade society to blossom in school
where adolescent identities are nascent and fragile. We should keep
such distinctions and hierarchies at bay.
</P>
<P>
   While grades may be a necessary evil, it is the more invisible
forms of exclusion and status ranking that are, precisely because
of their invisibility, much more dangerous and difficult to
regulate.
</P>
<P>
   To have to be reminded every day that one is at the bottom of
one or more of these informal hierarchies can easily become too
much to bear.

   WALNUT CREEK, Calif. _ It's time to repeal the Second Amendment.
As beautiful and majestic a blueprint as is the Bill of Rights in
the U.S. Constitution, 'tis not infallible, no more than the
oft-contradictory Bible or any other work of man.
</P>
<P>
   Even our great nation was based on a lie, built on the backs of
slaves. It took us another 75 years to end that institution, and
yet another 102 years to guarantee Americans of African ancestry
the right to vote without being beaten or lynched.
</P>
<P>
   We repealed the 18th Amendment, the prohibition on alcoholic
beverages, in 1933. All the ``noble experiment'' did was empower
and entrench organized crime in America.
</P>
<P>
   Are we so smitten by top 10 lists and the divinity of numbers,
that by virtue of being the Second Amendment, the ``right'' to bear
arms becomes sacrosanct? Even the noblest and brightest of
slave-owning land barons could not foretell a distant future of
armor-piercing 12 rounds-a-second at Guns-R-Us.
</P>
<P>
   So, if it took us 133 years (144 since the Declaration of
Independence) to give women the vote, 177 years to safeguard all
citizens' right to vote, perhaps 212 years is high time to deliver
us all from the ever-present threat of impromptu insta-death.
</P>
<P>
   Those suffering a compulsion to bang away at targets with deadly
ammunition could still do so at gun clubs _ as they do in the
United Kingdom, a grown-up country, where the lethal toys are
returned to locked storage at the club after playtime.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Charlton Heston, the president of the National Rifle
Association, might one-up his Moses role by not parting but
cleaning up the Red Sea and all the world's oceans, a timely adult
campaign. Why play great men, visionary leaders, when you might
become one, using your acting gift to encourage the populous to
sacrifice for the greater good?
</P>
<P>
   We did this, gave up our guns, once before. They were called
scrap metal drives during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom is an adult concept. Children are meant to graduate
beyond self, to comprehend the ``us'' of adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA is a small-minded, albeit focused (aimed) organization
hinged solely on an ancient amendment of an agrarian, tentative,
experimental society whose members might at any moment have had to
drop their plows and hoist single-shot muzzleloaders.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA's insistence on legalized assault weapons underscores
its members' shallow, immature self-interest. Concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Cop-killing bullets. What's next _ bazookas, personal cannons?
</P>
<P>
   At what precise diameter does bullet become projectile? If
exploding bullets are validated, what size personal bomb might the
18th-century Second Amendment allow?
</P>
<P>
   OK. If you really are the National Rifle Association and stand
proudly for the Second Amendment of 1787, you may register, license
and keep your 6-foot-long, single-shot, flintlock muzzleloaders
with the explosive chemistry and metallurgy available during the
1780s. Nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   See how many banks are knocked over with one of these; how many
children and police officers are slaughtered; how many innocent
bystanders, shoppers and postal workers mowed down.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, gun nerd: Freedom. To keep and bear 1787 squirrel guns
not one whit better than those available when the Second Amendment
was written by slave-owning, female-vote-denying, indigenous
peoples-killing, land-grabbing patriarchs. Your hefty taxes,
license and registration fees will fund national trauma centers for
the rest of us.

 &HT;    LEGAL EXPERTS SAY SETTLEMENT A LIKELY END TO COCA-COLA BIAS SUIT
 &HT;    700&AMP;add. With COKE-EEOC. For release Sunday, May 9.
 &HT;    By DAVID McNAUGHTON

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The advice may be hard to swallow, but some crisis
managers and marketing specialists suggest Coca-Cola should settle
an employment discrimination lawsuit filed against the company.
</P>
<P>
   One former and three current employees sued April 22 in federal
court in Atlanta, charging the company discriminated against
African-Americans in pay, promotions, evaluations and terminations.
They also sought class-action status, which would raise the stakes
considerably for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the most important thing is that a company take a look
at what we call its trust bank, or how likeable it is,'' said Eric
Dezenhall, a crisis manager and a founder of Nichols-Dezenhall
Communications Group in Washington. ``A company like Coca-Cola is
an extremely likeable company.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The general rule of thumb (for companies) with a high trust
bank is to keep it out of the news and settle it promptly,''
Dezenhall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand not wanting to settle,'' said Pam Scholder
Ellen, an associate professor of management at Georgia State
University who specializes in marketing and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The down side of going through with the lawsuit is that the
connection between Coca-Cola and racism gets played over and
over,'' she added. ``In the long run, it may not be worth the
negative publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the easiest way is to settle,'' offered Asterios (CQ)
G. Kefalas, a management professor at the University of Georgia and
a Coca-Cola shareholder. The benefit of doing so, he said, is that
it gets ``all the bad publicity off your back.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, argued Martin R. Stoller, a professor of
organizational behavior at Northwestern University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why capitulate the moral high ground unless there is clear and
compelling evidence you don't deserve it?'' asked Stoller, who has
helped defend companies in employment-related litigation. ``A
vigorous defense of your innocence is my advice.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he added, it is ``rare'' for a company to mount a
proactive defense like the one put on by Johnson &AMP; Johnson during
the Tylenol poisoning scare of 1982. Instead, he said, ``The
company will leap on its own sword without being pushed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of good crisis management is to fight on the
territory between what you did and how deliberately you are alleged
to have done it,'' Stoller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Settlement is the safest course of action from a legal
standpoint,'' advised Ian I. Mitroff, a professor of business
policy at the University of Southern California and founder of the
school's Center for Crisis Management.
</P>
<P>
   If a company defends itself, it needs to be ``squeaky clean, or
you're going to make the crisis worse,'' he said. ``If (the
allegations are) not true, and you have the hard facts, I would
come out blasting.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the four plaintiffs and what they allege:
</P>
<P>
   _ Gregory Allen Clark, a security officer at Coca-Cola. The suit
charges ``he has been denied promotions on the basis of race, and
has been repeatedly denied the opportunity to even apply for
promotions, because of the common practice of filling supervisory
jobs without posting the positions.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Motisola Malikha Abdallah, an administrative assistant at the
company. The suit alleges she ``has experienced discrimination in
performance evaluations and in the terms and conditions of her
employment.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Linda Ingram, an information systems analyst at Coca-Cola. The
suit alleges she ``has been consistently paid below her grade level
and thousands of dollars less than comparable Caucasian
employees.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Kimberly Gray Orton, a former employee of Coca-Cola. The suit
charges she ``was significantly underpaid compared with comparable
Caucasian employees, was compensated at the low end of her pay
grade range, and supervised Caucasian employees who were paid more
than she was.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit also alleges a company-wide pattern of discrimination,
a charge Coca-Cola Chairman M. Douglas Ivester denied in a memo to
employees.
</P>
<P>
   He also issued a statement saying the lawsuit is without merit.
``Discrimination at the Coca-Cola Co. is not tolerated,'' Ivester
said. ``If discrimination is alleged, we investigate it. If we find
it, we act to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Companies that find themselves under attack have to deal with
two courts, Mitroff said. One is the actual legal system, and the
other is public opinion. ``Even if you are not guilty, in the court
of public opinion, the burden of proof is on you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What a company has to do, he said, is ask: ``What's going to do
the least damage?''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, calculating the long-range impact of publicity goes
into formulating strategy, according to attorneys. And that
apparently is not lost on Cyrus Mehri, whose Washington-based law
firm filed the suit against Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a public dimension to (the suit), that's something
the company may have to deal with,'' Mehri said in a recent
interview. ``They are the most prominent company in Atlanta.
There's an African-American community there, and the
African-American community has a right to know what is going on in
this company.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, said Northwestern University's Stoller, the publicity
is not necessarily going to affect business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unlikely, in my mind, that a customer of Coca-Cola is
going to make a change based on some as-yet-unproven allegation,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, which has not filed a legal response to the suit,
says it would be premature to comment on the issues, including on a
debate whether it would be more advantageous to fight or settle.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, attorneys say, most employment discrimination suits
are not resolved by trial, particularly class action ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``If class action gets certified, generally they work out some
means of trying to settle,'' said Max G. Brittain Jr., a Chicago
attorney who specializes in employment law.

 BEYOND ROLLERDOME: DANCING ON SKATES BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER  
 For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By ROSS FINLEY  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A short, balding man in a beige shirt and black
trousers skates with a troupe of twenty-somethings, all of them
swaying to a dance beat in synchronized steps. A young woman in
spandex shorts glides around the dreadlocked DJ, hop-stepping, then
twisting around to skate backwards, and twisting around again.
</P>
<P>
   The sun is shining in Central Park, and the regular dance
skating crowd _ all smoothness and cool energy _ is out doing its
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an oasis in a concrete jungle,'' said Aristides Ruiz, a
regular who keeps his inline skates moving while taking a breather.
``To me, this is one of the best social scenes in New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene is the ``Dead Road'' between 66th and 72nd streets in
the park, where dance skaters show up each weekend sporting jogbras
and tight shorts or tie-dyed shirts or preppy pants. And as they
skate, they groove to the musical gamut: techno, hip-hop, funk and
salsa. Motion and music are mixed in a polyglot of cultures. Young
and old, dark and light-skinned _ all mingle to the beat-and-glide
rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   Looking good takes a lot of practice, though. ``It's tough _ I
always feel like I'm embarrassing myself,'' said Charlie Koven, 22,
on his second time in the dance-skate zone.
</P>
<P>
   While Koven attempted to boogie off by himself to the throbbing,
techno beat, others skated partners or bobbed and whirled in
synchronized groups. The eye-catching tableau, as usual, attracted
more than 100 appreciative onlookers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is great is that all kinds of people are here,'' said
Delphine Bedson, a visitor from Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   She and her friend ogled Jose Arzola, 48, a Puerto Rico native
who has been roller skating here for 22 years. Arzola says he also
appreciates how skating seems to attract people of all ages and
ethnicities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody leaves their baggage outside the park,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only place I've noticed where black and white, Jew
and Muslim, gay and straight, all kinds of backgrounds, you know,
just get together,'' said Steve Kay, a professional dance skating
instructor. ``Wheels and the music are a common denominator to
which these people can bond.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Williams, president of the Central Park Dance Skaters
Association, said the dance skating scene appeals not only to
teen-agers but to doctors, accountants, Wall Street brokers _ even
a few police officers. But the best thing about it is, Williams
said, ``It allows people with no cash to boogie.''
</P>
<P>
   The association was formed after a tumultuous period in the
early 1990s when rowdy DJs battled with police and park officials
over how loud they could play their music.
</P>
<P>
   Lezly Ziering, one of the founders of the skating association,
met his wife, Robbin, on skates in the park. They were married in
1997 at the Roxy rollerskating rink _ on skates, of course. ``The
whole park was there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kay also said that skating in Central Park changed his life. A
onetime Manhattan lawyer, Kay was practicing his moves one weekend
when an advertising crew spotted him and asked him to do a
commercial for Guess clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year, Kay had become a full-time inline dance skating
teacher, and professional performer who has skated on Broadway and
in a soap opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did this for pure enjoyment, not thinking that this would be
any kind of career move,'' Kay said.
</P>
<P>
   Another skater who has turned his expertise into a career is
Roger Green, who is well-known in Central Park for his odd choice
in skates. He wears an inline skate on one foot and a traditional
roller skate on the other. He toured with Michael Jackson in 1987
and once opened a show for Stevie Wonder. Green said skating has
become a kind of religion for him. ``It's not just about skating
for me. It's another level now.''

   NEW YORK _ The burly old Russian strapped himself with a bundle
of oak leaves and grunted in the eucalyptus-scented heat. Lesser
men can't take the pain for more than a few minutes, but this
Russian, who has more hair on his body than this head, motioned for
another ladle of the leaf-infused water to be thrown on the sauna
rocks. In seconds, brutally hot air covered him.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Bania, a Russian-style bath house in Brooklyn, where
$15 buys all the heat and steam you can stand. The oak-leaf
whipping costs extra, unless you do it yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is one of the best gifts you can give to your
body,'' said Dimitri Lamdon, a native of the former Soviet republic
of Moldova, as he watched Russian music videos in the bath house
lounge. A few yards away, the burly Russian continued to bake,
silent save for a snort or two and an occasional heavy sigh.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian bath, or bania, is a centuries-old tradition
designed to warm the bones and relax the body. It cleans the pores
and, some say, sweats toxins out of the body. The tradition is
alive and well in New York City, thanks in part to a new wave of
immigrants from the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Around the turn of the century, large numbers of Russians and
East Europeans immigrated to New York and brought the bania
tradition with them. The newcomers, many of them Jewish, called it
schvitzing, Yiddish for sweating.
</P>
<P>
   Besides offering a place to talk and argue, the baths served a
practical purpose. As in the old country, many couldn't afford an
apartment with a bath.
</P>
<P>
   The bath house in Brooklyn began, co-owner Craig Brasky said,
when Russian native Alona Kruglak approached him with the idea of
opening a bath for the newest wave of immigrants, who had come to
New York during the early 1990s. Brasky, who previously ran a
school bus company, agreed. The two opened Bania in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Russians are not the only people who like to schvitz. Alexia
Brue, 26, a Vermont native, visits a bath house on Manhattan's
Lower East Side about once a month.
</P>
<P>
   Brue, a marketing manager who lives in Manhattan, even tried a
platzka treatment, paying a professional to beat her body with the
leaf broom. Brue doesn't like the traditional drubbing of oak or
birch leaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like you're a human being in a car wash,'' Brue said.
``It's definitely not as pleasant as getting a massage.''
</P>
<P>
   A Russian bath sometimes starts with a dip in a heated pool. The
idea is to warm the body in preparation for what's to come.
</P>
<P>
   The two saunas and one steam room in Bania have three tiers of
benches. Each puts the bather in a different heat zone. The higher
the seat, the hotter the temperature. The so-called Russian Room in
one of the saunas heats to a sizzling 200 degrees. The wood-lined
sauna rooms each seat about 30 people. But, the heat can be more
intense than newcomers are used to. Water on the body dries so fast
it can give a chilling sensation, much the way rubbing alcohol
cools the skin as it evaporates. After the chill, the sweating
starts. Men and women share the facility in Brooklyn and wear
bathing suits. Brue prefers to visit the sauna on the Lower East
Side on ``women-only'' days.
</P>
<P>
   A platzka treatment, as the oak- or birch-leaf scrubbing is
known, is considered a way to further open the pores. At Bania, a
10-minute scrubbing costs $20. Customers can also select a broom
from a barrel of soapy water and give themselves or a friend a
platzka.
</P>
<P>
   After a good bit of schvitzing, a dip in the 58-degree cold pool
brings relief. The quick move from hot to cold makes the skin
tingle and brings the blood to the surface, sometimes producing a
sunburned look.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, patrons can relax at one of the poolside tables with
a glass of juice or vodka. If all the sweating has induced hunger,
Bania's restaurant offers a full Russian menu.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bernstein was a bath house aficionado when he moved to
Manhattan from Michigan in 1977. He's been going to the baths ever
since, frequenting an East Village bath house until about two years
ago, when he switched to Bania.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein used to schvitz daily, if only for 15 minutes. He
remembers seeing John Belushi, the former ``Saturday Night Live''
comedian infamous for his hard living, at the East Village bath,
sweating out the weekend's excesses. Now Bernstein goes about once
a week.
</P>
<P>
   The long hours in the heat have given him a deep appreciation
for the bath's relaxing qualities.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the deepest sense of the word, tension is an impurity,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein figures that a good schvitz also exposes him to
ancient air trapped inside the sauna rocks, which is released as
they crack in the heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a primal level, you're reconnecting with something that was
there millions and billions of years ago,'' he said. ``All you have
to do is sit there.''

PHOTO EXHIBIT CAPTURES AMERICA'S CENTURY, WITH A TWIST 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Monica didn't make the cut. Neither did the sailor
kissing the nurse in Times Square. Or the South Vietnamese general
executing a Viet Cong operative during Tet. Or the astronaut
standing on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``Picturing the Century: One Hundred Years of
Photography from the National Archives,'' which opened here in
March, includes surprisingly few of the pictures that a visitor
with a head full of best-of-the-century lists would expect to see.
</P>
<P>
   What it does include is 200 images of America during its first
fully angle than you're used to. Which is exactly what curator
Bruce Bustard had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain images become icons beyond just capturing a moment,''
said Bustard, a federal archivist. ``They're part of our collective
memory.'' The problem with these greatest hits is, they're so
familiar that we no longer really see them.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Bustard avoided the century's most famous
fractions-of-seconds as he selected photos from the eight
million-plus in the National Archives and Records Administration's
collection.
</P>
<P>
   As he began preparing the exhibition in 1997, he had already
decided on many of the images that would represent events and
photographers. While he admitted his list was limited, he also said
it was the only option.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way you can go through eight million pictures,''
Bustard said. ``You wouldn't want to'' _ especially since many of
the archives' photos are purely informational, depicting machinery,
land surveys, agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing only from this federal library also afforded him
different perspectives. Unlike the news media's more publicized
images, the archives' photos were taken by government photographers
to document the work of agencies, social programs, the military,
and official ceremonies, depicting America in its everyday moments.
</P>
<P>
   Arranged chronologically along the archives' Circular Gallery _
which curves behind the hall where the Declaration of Independence,
Constitution and Bill of Rights are displayed _ the photographs are
mostly sharp black-and-white until the exhibition's last quarter,
when the standardization of color film processing in the mid-1960s
becomes apparent.
</P>
<P>
   The photos range from turn-of-the-century panoramas of bustling
street scenes and sprawling farm landscapes, to President George
Bush among American troops in Saudi Arabia during Thanksgiving
1990, to President Bill Clinton playing a saxophone, to a beaming
President Boris Yeltsin of Russia at a 1994 summit.
</P>
<P>
   Often the scene is familiar history from a unique angle, since
the government photographer was not among the rest of the press.
American soldiers wade into the surf and German gunfire at Normandy
beach, as seen from the Coast Guard landing boat they have just
left. President Richard Nixon bids the White House farewell, as
seen from inside the helicopter he is boarding.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's an unfamiliar photo that connects the familiar
ones. A 1913 assembly line. A 1965 portrait of a young Marine
standing by during a troop arrival at Da Nang shows his uncertainty
weighing as heavily as the duffel he carries.
</P>
<P>
   Other times a renowned photographer puts a signature style to
work for Uncle Sam. Dorothea Lange's pictures of Depression
breadlines and children peeking out of shanties extend an influence
felt by anyone who's ever seen a ``Save the Children'' television
commercial, and Ansel Adams's landscapes of the American West are
echoed in the best nature and travel magazines.
</P>
<P>
   In photography, government work often means undistinguished
``grip-and-grin'' handshakes. ``For a government photographer, it's
harder to have a point of view,'' Bustard said. These photographs
contain a surprising range of emotion, though. There's fairy-tale
wonder in the shot of a mother and daughter in a sparkling white
1950s kitchen, an image that ran in a propaganda magazine sent to
the Soviet Union. There's the vaguely sinister inner-city teen-ager
leaning against an alley wall, from a study on urban renewal. Or
the sublime view of the Statue of Liberty's back, seen through a
clutch of telephone poles on the flats of Hoboken, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition does include, of course, some images you may have
seen before: Lyndon B. Johnson taking the presidential oath of
office next to a shock-scarred Jacqueline Kennedy, or President
Richard Nixon's 1970 meeting with Elvis Presley. ``I wanted some
markers, to remind people of the time period,'' Bustard said. In
this fresh context, however, they are hardly cliche.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure my collection could be absolutely
comprehensive,'' he said, ``but I hope this covers some of the
major events of the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Picturing the Century'' is a small, simply presented
exhibition. It possesses the energy of an anthem or a march,
though, a tune that reminds a nation who it is, and what's defined
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Picturing the Century: One Hundred Years of Photography from
the National Archives'' continues to July 4, 2001 at the National
Archives Building, Constitution Avenue at 7th Street NW,
Washington, D.C. Open every day except December 25. Hours: April 1
to Labor Day, 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Sept. to March 31, 10 a.m. to 5:30
p.m.

ALL-NIGHT GYMS WORK OUT FOR MANY 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By LULADEY B. TADESSE  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Physical conditioning is for daytime. Night is for
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   That is, unless one is a sanitation worker, theater manager, cop
or cab driver. For folks whose work may not fit a 9-to-5 pattern,
getting buffed can mean late hours and someone like Gil Flores.
</P>
<P>
   Flores, who studies film in his off time, works in one of a
handful of gyms in the city open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
The 30-year-old is the night manager at one, Crunch Fitness, an
international chain. Most of the city's more than 250 gyms operate
somewhere between the hours of 6 a.m. and 11 p.m., the peak times
for gyms-goers. But they miss potential customers seeking the
flexibility of an around-the-clock fitness facility.
</P>
<P>
   Flores says Crunch's night and day clients differ. ``The people
that come at night are more lively than the ones that come in the
morning,'' he said. ``In the morning, they don't want to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to work out when the rest of the city sleeps can be
job-related. ``Twenty-four hours is a very important factor because
we have the airport, Rikers Island, police precincts and Yellow Cab
people,'' said Peter Sarkissian, managing owner of BQE gym in
Woodside, Queens, one of the largest and oldest 24-hour gyms in the
city. ``Our parking lot looks like a TLC lot after midnight,''
Sarkissian said, referring to the Taxi and Limousine Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Velasquez and his fiancee, Vivian Bargas, both 30,
joined BQE two weeks ago. ``I live down in Corona,'' Velasquez
said. ``She lives in Brooklyn. We got very different schedules at
work,'' but they want to exercise together. Both work at the
airport and their schedules can vary from month to month.
</P>
<P>
   But clientele is not always limited to those who have irregular
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Igor, who would not to give his last name, a manager at Hardcore
Muscle &AMP; Fitness in downtown Manhattan, says some of his clients
like the quietness of the gym at night. About 75 percent of his
clients are men, mostly ``serious body builders,'' who prefer a
less crowded environment that allows them to concentrate.
</P>
<P>
   Crunch's Flores said: ``The people that come at night, they put
more in their workout, they have more enthusiasm. They are a lot
faster, more energetic on the machines than the morning ones.'' He
said he could not explain it, but guessed that they were coming
from work and were more focused on getting a good workout before
going home to crash.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason more gyms are not open all the time is
financial. ``The 24-hour upkeep becomes a big problem because there
is no down time for this equipment,'' said Sarkissian, who also
owns two other gyms, in Harlem and the Bronx, neither of which is
open 24 hours. ``You don't want to have yellow ribbons on your
equipment, he said, referring to indicators that the machinery is
out of order. BQE's biggest expense is payroll for its 40 to 50
employees. Utilities, which ``go up to $2 million a year,'' and
insurance are its next highest expenditures, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To stay competitive you have to diversify,'' he said. ``We
have to offer more than any gym is offering. Our biggest thing is
our price. You have two years for $149 a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Convenience is at the heart of most people's choice of a gym.
With that in mind, BQE has a free parking lot, a juice bar, a
restaurant, a pro shop, separate kids' and ladies' gyms, daycare
and other amenities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of gyms better than this but this is open 24
hours,'' said Ali Bazzi, 24, a three-year member of BQE. Bazzi, who
is about 6 feet tall with crisply defined muscles, said he works
out every day. A salesman in Connecticut who commutes from his home
in Inwood, Queens, Bazzi goes to the gym whenever his unpredictable
schedule permits.
</P>
<P>
   The main competition to BQE are smaller ``localized,''
neighborhood gyms in Queens that are also open 24 hours, Sarkissian
said. Cynthia, who would not give her last name, is the manager of
Platinum, a small 24-hour gym in Rego Park. Platinum, which looks
much like the neighborhood stores lining Queens Boulevard, offers
many of the same perks as BQE, including a juice bar, parking lot,
babysitting facilities and exercise classes, she said.
</P>
<P>
   For Igor, who now is daytime manager at Hardcore, having a gym
that was open at night was good for his health in more ways than
one. ``I was on dialysis,'' he said. ``I needed to go to the
hospital practically every second day.'' He said he no longer needs
dialysis and can now work when he pleases.
</P>
<P>
   Although Crunch's all-night policy allows Flores to spend his
days studying film, working the graveyard shift can take a personal
toll. ``I don't have any relationships at all. Period,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His weekends are devoted to making short films. ``Even on the
two days I have, I don't go out,'' Flores said. ``It has to be that
way.''

THE QUEST FOR FAME: THE PATH FROM THE DOGHOUSE TO THE PENTHOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By ERIK LINDEN  
 c.1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was their first trip to Manhattan. Like so many
young and aspiring actors, Reba and Sondra King were innocent and
starry-eyed, filled with dreams of hitting the big time. Their
acting careers might start with a dog food commercial or two, then
maybe Broadway or a debut on the silver screen.
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmed by the behemoth skyscrapers and the yellow cabs
crawling like ants down 34th Street, the suburban damsels wrestled
their leashes and panted anxiously.
</P>
<P>
   Two rotweillers from Staten Island can feel a bit out of place
in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this wasn't the best idea,'' Heather King, 23, the proud
mother, said to her husband. ``This was your idea. They're not used
to this.''
</P>
<P>
   King and her husband, Kevin, and their two dogs ventured into
the city to attend a seminar called ``How to Make Your Pet a
Star.'' Taught by seasoned animal trainer Barbara Weir, the
one-time class shows people the tricks of the trade for launching
their pets into careers in advertisements, on stage and screen.
</P>
<P>
   While many pet owners think their animals are cut out for
stardom, getting a pet into the acting business is no walk through
the park. Becoming Eddie from the TV sitcom ``Frasier'' or Morris
from the Nine Lives cat-food commercials is a rare feat. More
often, pets from New York City land relatively anonymous jobs in
print advertisements, photographs on greeting cards, or in theater
and opera.
</P>
<P>
   In the tiny room on 34th Street where the $40 seminar was held,
Reba and Sondra were the first to arrive; eventually, 16 other
owners and their pets trickled in. Two Jack Russell terriers, a
handful of poodles and a Bichon Frise arrived. Then a woman from
Queens named Maureen Kelley came in and unzipped a black duffel bag
with breathing vents. Out crawled Piper _ a 13-pound Turkish Angora
cat with style.
</P>
<P>
   Named after the pricey Champagne, Piper Heidsieck, the lone
feline sat patiently on Kelley's lap, while the drooling dogs faced
her down.
</P>
<P>
   Class began with the bad news. Weir, a tall, thin 66-year-old
who lives in New Jersey on a horse farm, told participants: ``Your
pets will not make you famous, nor will they make you rich.'' She
went on to say that, first and foremost, when considering the
acting business what every pet should be able to do is, well,
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   If a pet can't sit or stay in one place for five minutes, Weir
says, forget about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Animals are basically props,'' said Weir, who has been in the
animal training and agent business for 10 years. ``That means no
sniffing or socializing, and complete calm.'' Directors of
commercials, theater and film look for placid animals who obey
orders, she said. ``One growl and a director will throw you out and
get another dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Weir's animals have impressive resumes. Her two greyhounds
performed in ``Don Giovanni'' at the Metropolitan Opera, and her
mutt named Fancy appeared regularly on ``The Cosby Show'' in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Weir brought along a veteran performer and her master to the
seminar: Carolyn ``Cookie'' Baker and her Yorkshire terrier named
Tiger Lily. The miniature, sandy-colored terrier appeared recently
in the Lillian Vernon catalog, and on a Valentine's Day greeting
card in which she held a long-stemmed rose in her tiny jaws.
</P>
<P>
   Showing off her stuff, Tiger Lily rolled over on command, as
other participants looked with admiration. Baker then placed a pink
rubber bone in Tiger Lily's mouth and stepped back to the rear of
the room. The redheaded Baker then instructed the dog to ``drop
it,'' and obediently, she did.
</P>
<P>
   Baker says that she enjoys doing different acting jobs with
Tiger Lily, and more for the novelty than for the money. ``I've
been doing this for a while,'' Baker said. ``And I'm not rich
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Income from commercials or theater, Weir told her audience, is
usually around $150 per hour. But they can earn more if their
particular breed is in demand, or if a project lasts for several
days.
</P>
<P>
   Most pets that land parts in movies live in Hollywood. Their
owners usually have several dogs of the same breed who look
identical. ``Some of them have eight of the same dog,'' Weir said.
``It's their living, and it's their business.'' In the movie
``Beethoven,'' she said, directors used eight different Saint
Bernards on the set.
</P>
<P>
   The first step for getting into the business, Weir told
participants, is to have a pet obedience-trained. Then, shoot some
simple 5-x-7 photographs of the animal against a flat background.
And finally, send the photos to a talent agency such as All-Tame
Animals or Dawn Animal Agency, both based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   After Tiger Lily did her pink bone routine, Piper, the calm cat,
went to the head of the class and _ despite facing 16 dogs _
remained mellow. Piper sat on a tattered black chair and withstood
several growls and swipes from Reba and Sondra, the two
rotweillers.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Maureen Kelley said Piper has always been a looker. That's
why she brought him today. ``Everybody keeps telling me how cute he
is,'' Kelley said. ``I think he'll be happy if he can get some
work.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Reba and Sondra, the rotweillers won't be getting work
anytime soon. The two dogs left early with their owners after
Sondra lunged at Piper. ``I'm not sure it's for her,'' King said,
smiling. ``I don't think she really cares about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Piper, on the other hand, might have what it takes. Kelley said
she plans to shoot some glossy photos of Piper, send them to an
agency, and hope for the best. As Kelley zipped Piper back into the
breathable duffel, the two headed toward the Empire State Building
and into the New York night.

   NEW YORK _ It's shortly after 10 p.m. on a clear April evening
as A.J. Calloway struts through Justin's, a popular lower Manhattan
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   His shoulder-length dreadlocks pulled back to show off his
chiseled features, Calloway stops to chat with a group of young
men, giving handshakes as he moves on to another group. With a
drink in hand, he looks as if he's unwinding from a long day's
work. Actually, his workday has just begun.
</P>
<P>
   His place of operation is in clubs such as this one, filled with
young, good-looking people, dancing and drinking the night away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody parties,'' said Calloway, a member of Black Diamonds
Entertainment, one of New York's most active event promotion teams.
``It's all about making sure everybody is having a great time. It's
not all fun and games, trying to throw parties in New York, but
somebody's got to do it, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, more and more young entrepreneurs think so. Black
Diamonds Entertainment and other events groups, like ProLinks Inc.,
Net2 and Partners in Soul, hold parties several nights throughout
the week at New York clubs like NV, the Metronome, Vivid, Cream and
Nell's, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   Calloway said he believed people spend a lot of energy figuring
out what to do after work or over the weekend. Wayne Shields,
one-fifth of ProLinks, agreed. Like Black Diamonds Entertainment,
ProLinks has been on the party scene since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is a large town, but there's not many places to party
and network for professionals,'' said Shields, a senior investment
specialist at T.I.A. Kraft by day. ``I wanted to set the type of
ambiance and environment where you could meet your peers,
especially if you're a professional or corporate type.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Shields and Calloway said they went after a ``professional,
25 and older'' crowd. While making sure their clients have a good
time, the promoters say they are also concerned with matters such
as contracts with club owners, security and disc jockeys.
</P>
<P>
   But, for Calloway, there's one major downside to the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleep deprivation,'' he laughed. ``You're up at events during
the day, booking venues, going after sponsors. Then, at night,
you're at the parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Shields, Calloway, a 1997 graduate of Howard University,
does not have a day job. Still, he and his partners are doing well
financially, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he wouldn't get specific about revenues. ``Let's just say
that we're making more than the average young doctor coming out of
school,'' he said. ``The money depends on the venue you choose and
the agreement you have with the owner.''
</P>
<P>
   Some expenses Black Diamonds incurs come from providing
security, which Calloway said, can cost up to $700 a night. But
sponsors, such as FUBU Clothing, Johnnie Walker or Philip Morris
can offset this.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Black Diamonds, ProLinks is steering clear of the typical
club scene, opting to hold events at private lofts in the Flatiron
District that normally are used for magazine photo shoots.
</P>
<P>
   ``People get tired of that club atmosphere or environment,''
said Shields, adding that his group pays up to $6,000 for eight
hours at a venue like Nancy's Loft at 20th Street and Fifth Avenue.
The only club ProLinks deals with is Vivid Bar and Lounge at
Madison Avenue and 31st Street. There, the group holds its ``First
Fridays After-Work Mixer'', which is an ``invitation-only'' event,
Shields said.
</P>
<P>
   Shields said the Internet has been a big help to the business.
Gone are the days where promoters are handing out fliers on street
corners. Sending e-mails messages, Shields said, is the best way to
assure a safe, fun party environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got 10,000 people on our e-mail list,'' Shields said.
``By sending out these e-mails, it maintains a certain quality of
people. Instead of putting up posters and having street teams,
you're able to be a little discerning as to who comes in.''
</P>
<P>
   Calloway agreed, adding that Black Diamonds' motto, ``We reserve
the right to be selective,'' is placed at the end of every
promotion that appears on Web sites like Socialstep.com, a popular
Internet destination where parties and other entertainment events
are listed.
</P>
<P>
   Calloway says holding a party at Justin's, which is owned by
rapper and record producer Sean ``Puffy'' Combs, is a great way to
draw people in.
</P>
<P>
   ``People know Puffy and other celebrities often frequent
Justin's, so they may come out with the hope that they might run
into someone,'' he said. ``We never guarantee it, but it almost
always happens that someone big comes through.''
</P>
<P>
   Shields doesn't see the logic in such advertisements because,
``Puffy and Jay-Z aren't going to announce what parties they go
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Anika Warren, a 27-year-old student at Columbia University's
Teachers College, said she chooses parties based on the promoter's
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my girls and I are looking for a hot party and there are a
lot of things going on, we'll decide by what type of crowd we think
the promoters will attract,'' said Warren, who frequents Black
Diamond parties at Aubette and NV.
</P>
<P>
   Shields said this has been the trend for most of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The social scene has changed a lot. There was a time,
particularly in the Studio 54 days, when clubs were in,'' Shields
said, referring to a popular nightspot in the days of disco.
``Then, violence happened and clubs fell out of favor. That's when
promoters came into the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Shields said promoters became as popular as the clubs
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, it was all about the venue, but as the '90s started,
it was who was throwing the party,'' Shields said. ``Clubs didn't
need promoters, but now, people follow the promoter.''

 GAYS STRUGGLE FOR PLACE IN ORTHODOX COMMUNITY  
 For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as
desired.  _
 By SARAH DOUGHERTY  
 c.1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Michelle, a 30-year-old office worker, has been
disowned by her parents. When she saw them a year ago, at her
grandparents' anniversary, it was the first time she had seen her
parents in seven years, even though they live in the same city. She
is forbidden from speaking to her youngest sibling, now 12. Her
older sister is one of her only connections to her family.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle is a lesbian. She is also a Hasidic Jew. Hasidism is
one of the most traditional branches of Orthodox Judaism _ and in
the eyes of Michelle's family and community, there is no room for
being both Hasidic and homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle, who asked that her full name not be used, has had few
people to turn to. She tried joining a more liberal synagogue, but
did not feel at home. And she felt rabbis were not properly
educated to deal with her problems.
</P>
<P>
   Now she has found some solace with a support group for Orthodox
women who are lesbian, bisexual or transgender. About 20 women
ranging from 19 to 50 years old meet monthly, and with the help of
a facilitator discuss family difficulties, coming out, and finding
a partner who shares their traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Such groups have been around for over a decade, in some cases,
in cities from Los Angeles to London to Tel Aviv, helping their
members _ both men and women _ reduce their sense of isolation and
reconcile their religious beliefs with their sexual orientation.
But now the message of such groups is beginning to find its way
into public dialogue. Some members of the Orthodox community have
come out in recent years, and struggles of Orthodox gays and
lesbians will be highlighted in the film ``Trembling Before G-d,''
by filmmaker Sandi DuBowski, due to be released next year.
</P>
<P>
   The dilemmas faced by those struggling with their sexual
orientation are compounded by the fact that the Orthodox life can
be all encompassing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The religion really circumscribes your whole day from the time
you open your eyes in the morning to when you go to sleep,'' said
Shlomo Ashkinazy, facilitator for a men's group in New York City.
``There are prayer services, rituals to observe, certain foods you
can eat and dress you can wear.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Greenberg, an Orthodox rabbi who recently came out,
agrees. ``The Orthodox life is both oppressive, if you don't fit
well, and very sweet for those for whom its rhythms are natural,''
Greenberg said. ``The calendar, relationships, and expectations are
set out in advance and there's a dependability and meaningfulness
of life that is never questioned.''
</P>
<P>
   Many years ago, Greenberg was a rabbi at a synagogue, but would
not have been able to remain there if he had revealed his
homosexuality. He is now an educator and community developer at the
National Jewish Center for Learning and Leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family's reaction has been, 'It's hard, but we love you,'''
Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg has given interviews to newspapers in the United
States and Israel and strongly believes that change will happen
only when sufficient numbers of people come out to family and
rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they see that these people are their children, their
friends, their students and nephews and nieces leading decent
lives, things may change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions differ on whether Orthodox Judaism will ever be
completely accepting of homosexuality. Although there is a range of
communities within Orthodoxy itself, with some being more
traditional than others, other movements, like Reform and
Reconstructionist Judaism, are much more accepting.
</P>
<P>
   The Reconstructionist movement, for example, voted in 1984 to
accept openly gay and lesbian students to its seminary and to
ordain them. It urges rabbis and congregations to be as inclusive
as possible, but leaves decisions on performing same-sex marriage
ceremonies up to individual rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Richard Hirsch, executive director of the
Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association in Philadelphia, believes
that there will be liberalization in the Orthodox movement in the
future. ``There are lots of prohibitions Orthodoxy has gotten
around in the past,'' he said. He cited the prohibition on burying
suicide victims in Jewish cemeteries with a Jewish ceremony as an
example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, the prohibition on male homosexual acts may have been
based on the assumption that homosexuality was a choice,'' Hirsch
said. ``That is a receding assumption.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Orthodox rabbis do not believe that fundamental change
will occur _ in particular for the prohibition on male
homosexuality, which appears in the Torah. (The rule against
lesbianism appears in rabbinical writings.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Torah is God's revealed word to man,'' said Rabbi Steven
Dworken, executive vice president of the Rabbinical Council of
America, which represents about 11,000 mainstream Orthodox rabbis.
``So any new scientific knowledge about the nature of sexuality
will not change the prohibition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But we demonize the act and not the person,'' Dworken said.
``I don't know of any congregations that are not open to admitting
homosexuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many gays and lesbians don't feel comfortable going to
their rabbis for support. Myriam K., the facilitator for the
support group that Michelle attends, said, ``The reaction of rabbis
varies. Often their public position and private responses varies.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashkinazy agreed. ``Rabbis will often say, this is between us,''
he said. ``Not many want to go on the record'' _ which effectively
forces gays and lesbians to stay in the closet.
</P>
<P>
   But most Orthodox homosexuals look for approval closer to home.
``We always talk about the family issue in the group,'' Myriam
said. ``It's the issue that brings the most distress to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Michelle is still trying to replace the family and community she
has lost. She focuses a lot of energy on developing a talent she
was never able to pursue in her family's home _ singing. It was
considered immodest for women to sing in front of men. She now
sings with two choral societies in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Although Michelle claims that the pain of being cut off does not
hurt as much now, the look in her huge blue eyes seem to suggest
otherwise. ``Jews of all people should know what it's like to be
oppressed,'' she said.

CALL IT NETIQUETTE: E-MAIL INTRODUCES A NEW ERA OF ETIQUETTE 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as
desired.  _
 By HANNAH MITCHELL  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was just another e-mail message. ``Hi, sweetie,
how are you?'' Audrey Le wrote the message to her kid sister and
sent it on its way. No problem.
</P>
<P>
   Except that she entered the wrong address. The e-mail went to
the male teacher's assistant in her economics class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have the right address?'' he asked her gingerly the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said 'Oh, my God,' '' recalled the 20-year-old Columbia
University student, laughing and adding, ``It wasn't funny at the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Electronic messaging makes communication easier than ever
before, but with its speed, affordability and accessibility come
downsides, sometimes major ones. Send the wrong message and a
friend can be permanently deleted from your address book. Send to
the wrong mailbox, and you could lose your job.
</P>
<P>
   Given these new hazards, someone has to outline the dos and
don'ts.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the etiquette experts, who have recently turned their
discriminating eyes to e-mail. These arbiters of good taste and
manners are warning of the dangers of sending the wrong message.
Even the queen of etiquette herself, Emily Post, posthumously
includes an e-mail section in her latest edition, written by her
daughter, Peggy Post. And entire Web sites are devoted to what's
commonly known as ``netiquette.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Barbara Pachter, president of a New Jersey-based
business etiquette and communications company, added e-mail
etiquette to her traditional staples such as business dining and
letter writing. Companies pay for most of the seminars, though
Pachter has also advised civic clubs and taught for Rutgers
University's M.B.A. program.
</P>
<P>
   Pachter says the biggest mistake most people make is to treat
electronic messages like casual phone calls between old friends.
E-mail should be used with care, she says. ``It's a word document
and it will come back to haunt you'' is the recurring theme of
Pachter's e-mail sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, people laughed when I said that,'' she said. ``But
there are consequences to the quality of the writing. People print
them out and people circulate them. E-mail is not private. Your
company has access to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Two executives at Salomon Smith Barney lost their jobs in 1998
for transmitting pornography electronically. At Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, two former employees who are black sued the company after
receiving racist jokes by e-mail. The case was dismissed in 1997.
The e-mail was sent from outside the office and circulated among a
few employees, who the employer disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   While e-mail is speedy, it can have long-term consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Sternberg has written her doctoral dissertation on
Internet misbehavior, from electronic crime like e-mail viruses, to
gaffes like Li's. People send electronic messages to the wrong
addresses all the time, said Sternberg, who recalled one example
that left someone in a shaky spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was trying to put together a panel and was inviting
participants,'' said Sternberg, a doctoral degree candidate in
media ecology at New York University. ``Someone on the list, who
was more famous, wanted money to be on the panel.'' The panel
organizer obliged, but did not compensate the other panelists. He
received a thank-you e-mail from the celebrity, who mistakenly sent
it to the unpaid participants.
</P>
<P>
   Pachter advises that when sending an e-mail message to a
prospective employer or client, you should make sure your spelling
and grammar are perfect. E-mail is technically in memorandum form,
but senders should still include a salutation and ``sign'' their
name. If you don't know whether to call or e-mail, follow the other
person's lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they call you, chances are you should call them,'' Pachter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Common sense may still be the best guide. ``E-mail erupted so
quickly that the guidelines and how to handle it are still
evolving,'' Pachter said.
</P>
<P>
   Sternberg agreed: ``We've only had e-mail for about 15 years,
for most people less than 10 years. It will take time, in the same
way it took us time to develop codes of conduct for the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, the rules of the game are being disseminated through the
e-mail grapevine. Bruno Pelletier, a San Francisco jazz musician,
uses e-mail to send his clients invoices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks better than a hand-written note,'' said Pelletier,
39. ``It means you're established.'' But he is careful with his
newfound business device. ``I had friends that kind of showed me.
Apparently, you're not supposed to use all caps, because it looks
like you're shouting.''
</P>
<P>
   The rule on capital letters happens to be one of Pachter's eight
``ways to mind your electronic manners.'' The others are: don't
contribute to e-mail overload; keep messages short, one screen or
25 lines maximum; use short paragraphs, they are easier to read;
fill in subject lines to help the reader focus; limit each message
to one subject; proofread messages, and remember e-mail isn't
always private.
</P>
<P>
   Pachter also advises e-mailers never to send a message when they
are angry. ``It's too quick, too easy to push the button and it's
gone,'' she said. ``If you're writing a letter, at least you've got
to print it out, address the envelope and send it. And usually by
then you've come to your senses.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Bennett, a 28-year-old computer graphics artist, likes
communicating with pen pals by e-mail, but acknowledges it has its
shortcomings. She recalls one regrettable message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said something, not realizing this person doesn't know me,
and they took it the wrong way,'' said Bennett, smoking Marlboros
and sending e-mails at Internet Cafe in Greenwich Village. ``That's
kind of hard, too, going in and saying, 'I'm sorry.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Had she had the benefit of italicizing or underlining some of
her words, Bennett said, her dry humor might have been understood.
``It's hard to express actual emotion'' by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The Emily Post etiquette guidebook addresses that lesson. ``The
fact that the recipient cannot see you and you cannot see him or
her imposes certain limitations,'' it reads. ``The recipient can't
hear the tone of your voice, so it is especially important not to
offend people.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Riffe, 34, manager of the Internet Cafe, says he has
never knowingly committed an e-mail etiquette blunder, but he has a
friend who has done so. ``They thought he had an attitude,'' he
said. ``Somebody can read anything into anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem may be that people are out of practice. Back
in the 1800s, for instance, Riffe said, people wrote many letters.
But these days, virtually everyone has given up the pen.
</P>
<P>
   Sternberg said : ``There's probably a whole generation of people
who simply never did much letter writing. E-mail is bringing them
back to the written word. But I don't think people can assume that
e-mail is like written letters.''
</P>
<P>
   Pachter added, ``E-mail doesn't replace face-to-face
communication.''

NORTHERN UNDER-EXPOSURE HITS U.S. COLLEGES 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By CHRIS NUTTALL-SMITH  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Minot State University, a tiny school in the northwestern North
Dakota farm belt, has always looked north to fill its classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the school relied on students from Saskatchewan and
Manitoba to increase its enrollment. Canadians often made up 15
percent of the student body and gave a significant lift to the
school's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   But now the university of 3,150 is facing a population crisis.
Already facing a gradual decline in enrollment of American
students, Minot this past fall found only 281 Canadians, just 9
percent of its student body, enrolled at the school _ down from
602, or more than 15 percent, in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   That drop in students, and the decline in revenue they bring to
the school, has forced Minot to cut faculty positions and some
courses, said Nancy Hall, Minot's registrar and dean of
institutional planning. For example, the school has essentially
shuttered its political science department, declining to replace
its sole instructor after he left the school, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the bottom line is we brought in fewer tuition
dollars, so we had to reduce the budget,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit is the same one that has thinned Canadian enrollment
at colleges across the country: the Canadian dollar. At an average
of 65 cents to the U.S. dollar, the currency this year has been at
its weakest ever. As its value has fallen, paying U.S. tuition fees
and living expenses has grown more expensive for Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   Faculty and administrators around the country complain that the
decline in Canadian enrollment hits more than the bottom line. They
say it also affects the level of diversity in classes, and it
strips away some of the students many U.S. educators consider among
their best.
</P>
<P>
   Many schools are being forced to adapt. Some offer incentives,
such as lowered tuition rates to Canadians; others have stepped up
financial aid and recruiting. But for many colleges, locked into
tuition levels set by state boards, and unable to increase
scholarships, the options are few.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless that exchange rate turns around,'' Hall said, ``we
could send four more recruiters up to Canada, and I don't think
we'd get more students.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada's presence in U.S. colleges is still strong. Only five
other countries, all in Asia, send more students to the United
States. Canada sent 22,051 students across the border to study this
fall, according to the Institute of International Education, a
non-profit research and advocacy organization for international
education exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that number is 4 percent lower than in the fall of 1997. And
the dip could be steeper than the figures show, said Peggy
Blumenthal, the institute's vice president of student services. The
institute records only the total number of Canadians enrolled in
education programs, not the number of new students. The drop in new
enrollments, she said, is likely higher than 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the colleges noted by the institute for their sizable
Canadian populations now report falling numbers. The University of
North Dakota in Grand Forks has 100 fewer Canadians than it had
four years ago, bringing its current total to just over 200.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just not as good a deal as we used to be,'' said Barry
Stinson, the university's director of international programs.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers at Calvin College, a Christian school in Grand
Rapids, Mich., mirror those at North Dakota: In 1992, the college's
292 Canadians formed 8 percent of the student body. Today, there
are just 212 Canadians, constituting over 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This despite Calvin's long history of admitting Canadians, its
strong French department and its political science and history
courses tailored for Canadians. Tuition and board there total
nearly $18,000 per year, or nearly $28,000 Canadian.
</P>
<P>
   An education at the most expensive Canadian university,
including tuition and living expenses, costs Canadians about
$12,000 in Canadian dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Like many colleges, Calvin has also put in place some hefty
carrots to keep Canadians coming.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it has beefed up Canadian exchange grants _ worth
$2,000 a student _ to lessen the effect of the currency exchange,
and officials there say the grants will likely increase in value
next year. Calvin also supports more than two-thirds of its
Canadian students with financial aid; the average amount is $7,500.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne State University, near Detroit, has always relied on
Canadian students who come to the school, just a few minutes south
of Windsor, Ontario. Last June, the university lowered tuition fees
for Ontario residents to the same rate Michigan residents pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that Windsor is so close that we should be providing
the same opportunity to them,'' said Tom Sees, Wayne State's
associate vice president of student affairs. More than 500
Canadians enrolled there this fall, up nearly 150 from the
preceding year.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, many colleges and universities do not depend so
strongly on Canadian enrollments as Minot State, and many more,
such as Wayne State, have managed to hold onto and even increase
their Canadian population in spite of the feeble Canadian dollar.
And some schools, such as hard-to-find chiropractic programs and
the Ivy League, are in such demand that affordability won't stop
students from coming.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Minot, the school's directors are in the midst of
considering whether to continue recruiting Canadians, or whether
their recruiting dollars would be better rewarded in the United
States. They say they might focus more on nearby states, such as
Montana.

   NEW YORK _ Jason Edmonds, a flower seller, begins his day at
3:30 each morning. Mother's Day is coming on May 9, and he wants to
be ready.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds, 29, works in a small room where the aroma of roses,
carnations and chrysanthemums guides buyers to one of the several
cut-flower wholesalers in midtown Manhattan, a group whose members
face cutthroat market conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds tells his Mexican employees how to handle the flowers
newly arrived from Europe and South America. The five hours leading
up to 8:30 a.m. are crucial, as floral designers and retailers will
have come and gone by then, their purchase orders _ if any _
filled.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, wholesalers on the block of 28th Street
between Fifth and Seventh Avenues, where Edmonds operates, not only
compete with ``delis,'' or small groceries, but also with growers,
retailers, and other flower-related businesses. Time, location and
transportation are also factors that determine economic success or
failure.
</P>
<P>
   Wholesalers are being bypassed by chain supermarkets and small
Korean groceries, which buy as a group, directly from growers. The
market is ``decreasing in Manhattan because there's a non-literal
Korean mafia,'' said Edmonds, sales director of the New Concept
floral shop, referring to what he says is price-fixing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all agreed to have the same prices,'' Edmonds said. ``If
you look at the volume that they sell, that was all business that
we were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Society of American
Florists say they have not heard of such a claim. But ``we don't
monitor the industry that closely,'' said Doyle Johnson, an
agricultural economist at the USDA.
</P>
<P>
   The competition in New York City is fierce, Edmonds said,
because ``there are fewer delis in other cities.'' In New York, he
said, ``you can find two delis in one block open 24 hours a day.
How can you compete with that?''
</P>
<P>
   Ari Koukladas, a Greek retail florist who owns Flowers by Valli
on the Upper West Side said he faced the same competition from
delis, even though ``here we have a refrigerator while they have
them out in the heat. Now even newspaper stands sell flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   Supermarkets are also competing with wholesalers buying the
stock in bulk directly from importers. ``Supermarkets are buying
bouquets straight from Miami,'' Edmonds said.
</P>
<P>
   Miami is the biggest entry point for flowers from Latin America,
receiving 95 percent of all the flowers brought from Colombia and
Ecuador, according to the Colombian Flower Council. Colombia is the
biggest cut-flower exporter, providing 64 percent of all the
flowers bought in the United States, and receiving $500 million a
year in revenue, the Colombian Flower Council said.
</P>
<P>
   With the development of telecommunications, such as the
Internet, large supermarket chains and retailers are finding it
easier, faster and sometimes cheaper to buy cut flowers directly
from growers. That eliminates the middle man, which ``is called
'Disintermediation,' '' said Philip Nowers, managing director of
the Colombian Flower Council in Miami. With Web sites and
advertising, growers ``feel they need fewer people'' to sell their
flowers to consumers. Nowers said wholesalers also avoid importers,
approaching the growers directly.
</P>
<P>
   But for other wholesalers near the New Concept shop, the biggest
problem affecting sales is the lack of space.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stores are very small,'' said Rob Hountenbos, one of the
three owners of another wholesaler, Dutch Flower Line, also on 28th
Street. Retailers, customers and designers cannot easily come into
Manhattan to buy and carry away flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working in early-century buildings,'' Hountenbos said,
referring to the early 1900s. ``If you create a building where
people can go in and choose their flowers _ and with parking _ we
could grow far more.'' There is one parking lot between Fifth and
Seventh Avenues with a capacity for 45 cars, but there are about 40
shops.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation also affects the market. Once Edmonds had to
deliver a flower shipment for a reception for President Bill
Clinton at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, but the flowers never arrived
from Holland because inspectors found bacteria in them. ``See,
Clinton has been affected by the flower business too,'' Edmonds
said.
</P>
<P>
   Refrigerated trucks carrying flowers at 34 degrees Fahrenheit,
to keep them from blooming prematurely, arrive in Manhattan at
sunrise. Edmonds says he buys about 400 boxes of flowers a week,
which is about 80,000 to 100,000 bunches. But, as many as 100 boxes
might be thrown away if the trade hits a low ``like right now,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   This year has not been good for anyone who sells flowers because
of the timing of some holidays. The most important days for the
cut-flower market are Valentine's Day and Mother's Day. But if
Valentine's Day ``falls on a Sunday it is a tragedy,'' Edmonds
said. ``It's good for restaurants, bad for the flower industry.''
People prefer to dine on the weekends; if the holidays fall during
the week, then the fastest and easiest thing is to buy a bouquet of
flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine's Day fell on a Sunday this year, and the New Concept
shop received its shipments of flowers late. Anticipating good
sales, they imported 150,000 ``stems'' of flowers from Ecuador and
Colombia. But the flowers did not begin selling until the end of
the week because ``Ecuadorean pilots went on strike, so everything
came late,'' Edmonds said.
</P>
<P>
   Mother's Day always falls on a Sunday, but Edmonds plans to buy
``probably a million stems'' for the occasion. ``It's now or
never,'' he said, to make up for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be crazy,'' Edmonds said comparing the week with
that of Valentine's. ``Not everybody has a girlfriend but everybody
has a mother.''

TV REVIEW: PBS OFFERS NOT-SO-GREAT `EXPECTATIONS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The learned producers of the latest ``Great Expectations'' know
what was wrong with Charles Dickens and what to do about it.
</P>
<P>
   Dickens was a sentimental slob. That's the problem. So ice his
story and then surgically excise the sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   Which leads to a ``Masterpiece Theatre'' rendering of ``Great
Expectations'' that's hard as a diamond and likable as a rabid
squirrel.
</P>
<P>
   Coolly intelligent and yet off-putting, the BBC production _
it's at least the fifth film version of the Dickens tale _ stars
Ioan Gruffudd as Pip, Justine Waddell (``Tess of the
D'Urbervilles'') as Estella and Charlotte Rampling as a
bleached-out Miss Havisham.
</P>
<P>
   Rampling is pale-eyed and dreary in the role. When a ``Great
Expectations'' won't give any juice to the dotty Miss Havisham, who
lives among the maggoty ruins of her unconsummated wedding feast,
you've got one frigid TV show.
</P>
<P>
   Gruffudd is the ticket. He came to ``Great Expectations''
straight from his star-making title role in ``Horatio Hornblower''
(televised on A&AMP;E cable last month), and the Welsh actor has every
reason for expectations.
</P>
<P>
   He's more loose-jointed as Pip than he was as Hornblower, and
here his innocence mixes with a nastily haughty streak. But
whatever the role's veneer, Gruffudd is a naturally appealing
actor. If only movie audiences can look at his name and learn to
say ``(set ital)Yo(end ital)-an (set ital)Griff(end ital)-ith,''
without thinking ``Elmer Fudd.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Marchant's script takes some liberties with Dickens' story,
especially in sealing up the conclusion. But in the main, a long
work has been smartly compressed into three hours _ 90 minutes each
night.
</P>
<P>
   Pip (played as a child by Gabriel Thomson) is a north country
orphan raised by his shrewish sister (Laila Morse), whose kindly
husband, Joe (Clive Russell), a blacksmith, takes Pip on as an
apprentice.
</P>
<P>
   Two events alter Pip's destiny. First is a brutish encounter in
a marsh with an escaped prisoner, Magwitch (Bernard Hill), whom Pip
helps. The second is a summons from the wealthy Miss Havisham to
become the playmate of her ward, Estella (Gemma Gregory plays the
young Estella).
</P>
<P>
   Years later, when a mysterious benefactor brings Pip to London
with the promise of a handsome property and a gentleman's station,
Pip assumes that Havisham is grooming him for marriage to Estella.
</P>
<P>
   But Dickens has surprises, which Marchant's script grudgingly
concedes, and Pip needs to learn that one's humanity isn't divvied
out on a class basis. Indeed, as one of Pip's tutors observes, ``No
varnish can hide the grain of the wood.''
</P>
<P>
   Gruffudd's Pip ingests his lesson and finds his Dickensian
reward without much violation, but the production around him is
chillingly austere.
</P>
<P>
   At first, ``Great Expectations'' plays almost like a hard-edged
psychological thriller. In the starkly photographed north country,
Pip is beaten down and abused by his sister, and terrorized by
Magwitch.
</P>
<P>
   Then it seems intent on proving the comment of the solicitor,
Jaggers (Ian McDiarmid), that ``there are two sorts in life, Pip _
beaters and cringers.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, when we see Pip screw up his tormented face and shout,
``Estella!'' you might sense a hint of Tennessee Williams. Either
that, or director Julian Jarrold was enjoying a bizarre little
joke.
</P>
<P>
   What the production never gets around to willingly is the full
Dickens. Yes, there's the blistering bleakness of the new
industrial age in England but scarcely any of Dickens'
counterbalancing poignancy.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose apparently is to modernize ``Great Expectations'';
the recent Americanized film with Gwyneth Paltrow was similarly
intended. It's a compliment to Dickens, in a way, implying that his
characters and their predicaments are timeless.
</P>
<P>
   But one reason Dickens is adored is that he is rooted in 19th
century England. In fact, he defined the time and place as much as
Queen Victoria. And in that setting, Dickens could point his
reportorial finger at greed and grime, then finally surrender to
love, charity and redemption.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Great Expectations'' seems to smell weakness in Dickens'
optimistic bow to humanity. It would be better with Charles in
charge.

PLAINTIFFS DROP CHARGE IN FORD FRAUD CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SETH ROSENFELD  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISO _ Lawyers suing the Ford Motor Co. for allegedly
covering up a defective ignition part they say could cause
dangerous stalling in millions of cars dropped one count of fraud
from their case.
</P>
<P>
   But they proceeded with two other claims accusing Ford of
deceptive business practices and false advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The move was announced Thursday as lawyers on each side of the
case prepared for opening statements May 11 before Alameda Superior
Court Judge Michael E. Ballachey, in the largest-ever class-action
lawsuit to go to trial against an automaker.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit contends that Ford withheld information from federal
regulators and the public about alleged defects in its Thick Film
Ignition module, which was mounted on the distributors of 22
million vehicles nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was brought on behalf of 3 million Californians who
own or owned 1983 to 1995 Ford vehicles. It seeks more than $3
billion in fines, and an order that Ford give back money to
consumers who had to pay for module problems.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has acknowledged the module was flawed, but denies it posed
a safety risk. The company said it fixed some cars under warranty,
others under a service campaign and improved the module in newer
models.
</P>
<P>
   In pretrial sparring, Ford on Thursday issued a press release
saying the lawyers for the plaintiffs ``have dropped charges of
fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Fazio, one of the lawyers bringing the case, called the
public relations release ``blatantly misleading.'' He said the one
count was dropped for ``strategic reasons,'' but added that ``each
and every claim in this case is based on fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford also claimed the plaintiffs had admitted they ``cannot
prove a single accident or injury'' due to the module.
</P>
<P>
   Fazio called the statement ridiculous, adding, ``We know that
Ford had a (module) failure rate that was unacceptably high. We'll
stand or fall on the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The case pits the nation's second largest automaker against an
unusual team: the San Francisco law firm of Hancock, Rothert &AMP;
Bunshoft, which is best known for insurance coverage work; and
Clarence Ditlow, director of the Center for Auto Safety, a
Washington, D.C., nonprofit organization started in the 1970s by
Ralph Nader.

TV REVIEW: DEFTLY TOLD CRIME TALE IN NBC'S `UNICORN' 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Noah's Ark'' was such a smash-mouth Nielsen hit _ hey, 63
million sets of eyeballs, at one time or another _ that from now
on, we'll have to look clinically at sweeps-month spectaculars and
say, ``Well, it was good, but it was no `Noah's Ark.' ''
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ``The Hunt for the Unicorn Killer'' is very good indeed.
And, thank goodness, it isn't ``Noah's Ark.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hunt for the Unicorn Killer'' is a rare network triumph
for unvarnished storytelling. Confident it has the goods without
stooping to trickery, it's the deftest crime grabber in many a
sweeps month.
</P>
<P>
   Based on fact, the two-parter stars Kevin Anderson (``Nothing
Sacred''), Tom Skerritt and Naomi Watts and airs Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The case involves the 1977 murder of Holly Maddux, a Bryn Mawr
graduate whose remains were found in a trunk at her former
boyfriend's apartment. He was Ira Einhorn, a well-known political
activist and New Age guru in Philadelphia. Also, a professed
pacifist with influential friends.
</P>
<P>
   Those are all the details you get from me, though the case is
well-known and continuing. It was in the headlines only three
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatically, the key fact about ``The Hunt for the Unicorn
Killer'' is that it's produced by Dan Wigutow, whose credits
include the 1984 NBC blockbuster ``Fatal Vision.'' ``Fatal Vision''
was a thinking man's thriller, at least by TV standards. It
captured a chilling murder case by means of studiously paced
suspense, solid characterization and meticulous plotting, rather
than souped-up gimmickry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hunt for the Unicorn Killer'' is cut from the same fabric.
Once again, the viewer's shiver comes from the unfolding evidence
that a talented, respected man committed a horrific act in a
murderous rage.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's first installment unhurriedly details the unholy
relationship between Maddux (Watts) and the scruffily charismatic
Einhorn (Anderson). She's the moth to his flame, subordinating her
own personality and ambitions to his.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Ira cheats on her, humiliates her in front of their
friends and forces her to have an abortion she doesn't want.
</P>
<P>
   Holly's family, in far-off Texas, endures all this with grudging
forbearance. Her father (Skerritt) can barely conceal his own
worries.
</P>
<P>
   Holly vanishes at the close of the first installment. Obviously
she's dead, and we know who did it, but the case drags on for
years.
</P>
<P>
   The case drags, not the production. The miniseries never flags
until the last few scenes on Monday, and by then any viewer can
toddle off to bed satisfied with two nights of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who fought to save ABC's ``Nothing Sacred'' last year
will be shocked to see Anderson _ sweet Father Ray, the
ever-compassionate Catholic priest _ as a heavy.
</P>
<P>
   But heavy he is; he's practically uranium, a man whose wits and
progressive social agenda conceal a seething, violent rage. He's a
man with an ego so huge that he'd sooner kill Holly than let her
leave him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women don't leave me,'' he says dismissively to a private
detective hired by Holly's father. ``I leave them.''
</P>
<P>
   True, in a way. He leaves them in locked trunks off his bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   There's no guesswork in the miniseries, except for if, when and
how Ira will be brought to justice. That's enough.
</P>
<P>
   I do have quibbles. Three hours would have been a better length
than the more conventional four. There are too many shots of young
women oozing with doe-eyed admiration as they hear Ira lecture. I'm
not sure why Holly's mother, Elizabeth, is practically invisible.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the networks has approached perfect since ``Lonesome
Dove.'' These days, I'll settle for pretty damn good. With its
intelligence, restraint and sure-handed pacing, this one will do.

ON FONDA: WAS THAT `GREAT' OR `GRATING'?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barbara Walters, shame on you.
</P>
<P>
   To include Jane Fonda among the cast of notables in the April 30
special ``A Celebration: 100 Years of Great Women'' is an insult to
every American man and woman who ever donned a U.S. military
uniform, and an affront to the survivors of every Vietnam War
veteran whose name is etched in the black granite wall in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   All 58,000 of them.
</P>
<P>
   And shame on you, ABC. Doesn't the ``great'' Ms. Walters have
editors who should have said: ``Hey, Barb, let's think about this a
minute. We know you have canned footage of an interview with Fonda,
but maybe you should dig a little deeper in the archives and come
up with someone who actually deserves the accolade.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly which definition of ``great'' did Walters and the
high-paid suits at ABC use when deciding to include Hanoi Jane
among the honorees in last week's 90-minute special? My dictionary
doesn't include committing treason as a qualifier.
</P>
<P>
   What sad, sad irony that PBS, at least in this part of the
country, was airing a segment of its moving series ``Battlefield:
Vietnam'' during an overlapping time slot. This exceptionally
well-done documentary, running every Friday night in the Fort
Worth-Dallas market until June 3, catalogues the military realities
of that ``conflict'' without including social slant or political
bias.
</P>
<P>
   ABC chose to celebrate the career of a woman who personifies all
the political ugliness of that chapter in American history _ and
just as this nation sits mired in another war-that's-not-a-war,
with pundits right and left drawing analogies to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Have the myopic egos at ABC totally forgotten history? Are they
so used to the revisionism seen through the animated eyes of parent
company Disney that they were oblivious to the fact that Fonda was,
and to many Americans still is, a traitor to her country?
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming to a theater near you, Disney presents `Jane Err,' the
delightfully touching story of a misunderstood American lass who
travels halfway across the world in search of peace and finds true
love chanting the poetry of Ho Chi Minh.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone under 30 out in TV land might be excused from not knowing
much about Fonda beyond her marriage to media titan/ballclub owner
Ted Turner and her ``earn the burn'' exercise videos. But for
crying out loud, Walters and ABC surely remember.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it was Walters who landed the 1988 ``20/20''
interview with the pseudo-repentant actress when she apologized to
veterans for her ``thoughtless and careless'' judgment in going to
North Vietnam to be used as a propaganda pawn for the communists.
</P>
<P>
   Thoughtless and careless judgment? This woman went invited to
the enemy's side of a war zone to broadcast anti-American
propaganda over Radio Hanoi. She peered into the sights of an NVA
anti-aircraft artillery launcher and wistfully pined that she
wished she could target one of those blue-eyed U.S. imperialists
dropping bombs on the Viet Cong.
</P>
<P>
   That's a whole lot of thoughtless and careless.
</P>
<P>
   Fonda had the same right as every other American to protest what
was happening in Southeast Asia in 1972, but she crossed the line
from exercising freedom of speech to treason when she aided and
comforted the enemy during wartime. Photographs of Fonda sitting
around a firebase with communist troops singing camp songs are as
nauseating today as they were almost 27 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As for that ``apology'' 16 years after the fact, it had more to
do with quieting the daily protesters mobbing the set of the movie
she was shooting in New England than it did with any epiphany to
seek forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Where does the ``great'' part come in? Her Best Actress Oscar in
1971 for playing a hooker in ``Klute'' (apparently good experience
for prostituting herself for the communists)? That she's in darn
good shape for a woman her age? That she married ``up''? Or was it
that recent crack in front of the United Nations about northern
Georgia being a Third World country when it comes to how its
children are treated?
</P>
<P>
   Lucille Ball and Golda Meir are lucky not to be around to see
their names linked with such an outrage. Hillary Rodham Clinton and
Oprah Winfrey probably didn't care.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, Fonda will be ``celebrated,'' all right _ as a traitor who
to this day has escaped punishment. Let's not forget that little
piece of reality as Disney tries to make her a female icon for the
20th century.

WILL GUMBEL'S RETURN TO MORNING KEEP HIM AWAKE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bryant Gumbel is said to be heading back to morning television
as joyfully as a kid let loose in toyland, but I've heard more
convincing stories emanating from jail cells. Of late, CBS has been
paying its prize defection from NBC so much for so little that it
was a certainty he'd either help revamp the dead-and-buried morning
show or start mopping floors and emptying trash bins.
</P>
<P>
   The question now isn't whether Gumbel will successfully
resuscitate the lifeless, third-place-out-of-only-three program
that will undoubtedly drop its name of ``This Morning,'' but
whether he'll be bored stiff trying.
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel, who starts Nov. 1, has never struck me as a morning
person, and this observation has nothing to do with him having to
rise at 3 a.m. and slip on a tie. It's about having to work in a
setting that didn't, and won't now, use his skills.
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel's perceived stuffy, snooty demeanor is twofold, one part
being that for a large chunk of his 15-year reign as co-host at
``Today,'' he figured life had to be far more challenging than what
was before him. I'll address the other later.
</P>
<P>
   With due respect to those who make their living in the
infotainment biz, the job calls for someone willing to endure
fluffy celebrity chats, ``People-''type human-interest stories and
those dreadful cooking segments.
</P>
<P>
   There's the occasional early morning wrap-up of breaking
stories, such as the recent Colorado shootings, but it's like
watching a pitcher take the plate with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Gumbel report on forged golf clubs on the acerbic HBO
magazine series ``Real Sports With Bryant Gumbel'' the other night,
I was reminded of his deft, no-frills interviewing skills, as well
as his poise and exquisite preparation. It also reminded me that
Gumbel, long known as a perfectionist, has never felt comfortable
being in the ``comforting'' business, which is what those breakfast
shows are all about.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in the Ken-and-Barbie context of on-air talent, he is
more apt to come across as rather intimidating, and certainly not
warm and fuzzy, either to the subjects paraded before him or to the
viewers watching. He certainly never seemed all that interested in
the hordes of sign-wavers freezing their petunias off on 49th
Street and Rockefeller Plaza, even though I truly believe that it
was that darn window that put ``Today'' over the ratings top.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose Gumbel believes that, too, because he reportedly
signed on after being promised a move to a studio with a ``window
to the world,'' as NBC calls it, at Trump International Plaza in
the heart of New York City's foot traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Window or no, Gumbel might still feel a sense of slumming. Just
watch Gumbel's expression when he's facing some celeb promoting
whatever and he's trying his best to look intrigued. You figure he
must be compromising every bit of his journalistic integrity.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the thought of Gumbel returning to a.m. fluff TV is
unnerving, if only to wonder if he's going there with his heart
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, his choices were limited. CBS lured him from NBC in
January 1997 by tossing a newsmagazine with his name in the title
and millions on his doorstep. ``Public Eye With Bryant Gumbel,'' a
high-minded hour refusing to stoop to the gutter level of
manipulative fear TV supplied by the likes of ``Dateline,'' won a
pair of Peabody Awards, an Overseas Press Club Award, and an
American Women in Radio and Television Award, but few repeat
viewers. CBS axed it at midseason last year.
</P>
<P>
   You have to respect a man who vowed to take the high road
despite the price. Now conjuring up morning ratings magic looms as
yet another hurdle. Not that he hasn't cleared others before.
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel was a print journalist before turning to television in
1972, and he's had to battle viewer and industry misperceptions
ever since. One was that a print sports reporter couldn't do
television, another that a TV sports journalist couldn't switch to
news, yet another that an African-American shouldn't have the
audacity to reek of confidence (read: ego and conceit).
</P>
<P>
   That's the second theory for Gumbel's perceived cockiness. Blame
my cultural bias if you wish. But black men who wear their
intellect on the outside are, more so than their white
counterparts, viewed as blowhards full of themselves. We can start
with Paul Robeson and work our way up.
</P>
<P>
   Reasons won't matter when ratings come out and the CBS sales
team wants to boost the price of a 30-second commercial, and can't.
When just as many viewers detest you as love you, there's a reason
for concern.
</P>
<P>
   It's bad enough that Gumbel has placed himself into the position
of savior, shoving aside current hosts Mark McEwen and Jane Robelot
(the plan is for them to stay until November), but he'll have to do
it against former co-host Katie Couric and golfing buddy Matt
Lauer.
</P>
<P>
   Climbing the ratings hill will be tough. There are 6.1 million
viewers who watch ``Today,'' 2 million more than ABC's ``Good
Morning America'' and 3 million more than the program CBS will
literally start from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Next up will be the selection of a co-host, which I think will
be a difficult task, seeing that conventional wisdom would lean
toward perky cuteness over substance, something that would only
irritate its star.
</P>
<P>
   What's certain, though, is that despite any disinclinations from
CBS' new a.m. star, this is a win-win for us early morning viewers.
The moment Gumbel arrives, the wake-up television wars will be
watchable again.

MEXICAN PRESIDENT TO VISIT CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo will make
his first official visit to California May 18 to 20, Gov. Gray
Davis announced.
</P>
<P>
   Davis invited Zedillo to the state while the newly elected
governor visited Mexico City in February.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo, who was elected in 1994, likely will travel to Los
Angeles, the Central Valley and to Sacramento, where he is expected
to address a joint session of the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Details were being mapped out, but Davis has said Zedillo would
meet with California business leaders to promote trade.
</P>
<P>
   During his campaign, Davis, a Democrat, promised to usher in a
new era of warm cross-border relations with the state's southern
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Trade was at the heart of the governor's February mission to
Mexico City, and Davis said fostering a cooperative climate would
achieve that goal.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico surged past Japan to become the No. 1 importer of
California goods in the third quarter of 1998. The state shipped
$12 billion worth of goods to Mexico in 1997.

 Barbara Stanny is the author of ``Prince Charming Isn't Coming: How
Women Get Smart About Money''(Penguin Books, 1997).  
 By BARBARA STANNY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Growing up, the only advice my father ever gave me about money
was ``Don't worry.'' Beneath those words, of course, was an
unspoken assumption: There will always be a man to take care of
you.
</P>
<P>
   One would expect something more substantial from Richard Bloch,
the ``R'' of H&AMP;R Block. But my father was well-meaning. He truly
didn't want his daughter to worry about money, and he sincerely
believed that managing it was a man's job.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't going to argue. Money was too complicated. And my
husband, a former lawyer who became a stockbroker and financial
planner, was perfect for the job. Or so I thought, until I found
out that my Prince Charming was a lousy money manager.
</P>
<P>
   But even knowing that, I continued to let him handle the
finances. That's how intimidated I was by money. I just signed
whatever he told me to sign. Over the course of our 15-year
marriage, he lost a fortune.
</P>
<P>
   That would have kept up indefinitely had it not been for an
incident at the ATM. I wanted to withdraw something like $60, but
the machine wouldn't give me the money. ``Insufficient funds,'' the
screen told me. I panicked, raced home and angrily confronted my
husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry,'' he said calmly. ``I'll take care of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words felt so soothing, like a warm bath on a chilly
morning. I desperately wanted to stay submerged in my illusion of
safety. But the ATM had just thrown a bucket of ice water in my
face. I could no longer not worry. I knew I had to do something.
</P>
<P>
   After the divorce, I made some feeble attempts to learn about
money, but my brain would fog up and my eyes glaze over. I quickly
gave up and returned to my blissful state of financial ignorance.
Life, however, had other plans.
</P>
<P>
   Within two years, I received over $1 million in bills for back
taxes my ex-husband never paid. He had left the country; my
signature was on the documents, so I was left holding the bag.
Unable to pay, I asked my father for a loan. He refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not supposed to worry about this stuff, remember,'' I
screamed as I slammed down the phone. I was furious, but also
terrified. I had three daughters, one just a baby. At that moment,
I knew that staying stupid was no longer an option.
</P>
<P>
   Then fate intervened. Working as a journalist, I joined a
research project on women and money. I interviewed more than 100
financially savvy women. Those interviews were life-changing.
</P>
<P>
   As I listened to how they went from being ignorant to smart
about money, I saw that it wasn't so much what they did, but how
they thought that made the difference. Each woman had come to a
series of seven realizations. I recognized immediately that those
realizations, when combined, were a process I could follow.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly what was inconceivable looked possible. In a short
time, I not only became smart about money, but I also wrote a book
to urge women to do the same. Now my publisher bills me as a
financial expert.
</P>
<P>
   How did I do it in such a short period after a lifetime of
financial lethargy? The key lies in the first realization _ the
quintessential step.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every woman I interviewed spoke of it as a turning
point, the defining moment in her financial life. They all started
with essentially the same realization: No one will do this for me.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Prince Charming isn't coming _ and please note
that the prince need not be a man. Our prince could be an insurance
settlement, the lottery or anything we fantasize will rescue us
financially.
</P>
<P>
   To become genuinely savvy, we must be able to say with total
conviction that we can do it ourselves. It doesn't matter if we are
male or female, single, married or living with a partner.
</P>
<P>
   As long as even a tiny part of us is waiting for, hoping,
expecting someone or something to assume responsibility for us, we
will never fully take charge of our finances _ and our future
security.
</P>
<P>
   For that lesson, I owe my father a debt of gratitude. He had the
guts to say no when I asked for a loan. I know now that it wasn't
easy for him. In hindsight, I see his refusal as both an admission
of wrong thinking on his part and a vote of confidence in me. It
was his way of saying: ``You can do it, I know you can, and it's
time you did.''
</P>
<P>
   I guess we both had to learn the hard way that Prince Charming
isn't coming.

<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ In an economy as polymorphously diverse as
America's, it seems unlikely that Harper's II Exotic Car Wash is
the only one of its kind. But it could be. ``It's the only one I'm
aware of,'' said Eddie Collins, who owns both the car wash and a
nearby strip club.
</P>
<P>
   Seven year ago, Collins, who drives a blue Corvette convertible
and is partial to gold jewelry, was ``looking to make money during
the day'' at his club. He considered selling used cars or getting a
U-Haul franchise. Then the detailer who had worked on his own cars
quit. A neon light bulb came on over his head: Why not open a
topless car wash?
</P>
<P>
   City officals resisted at first, but Collins took steps to
preserve public decorum. A privacy fence eight feet high surrounds
the entrance to the metal building behind the club, where women in
G-strings wash the cars.
</P>
<P>
   Business has been brisk, he said, averaging 25 cars a day _ more
during the Greater Greensboro Open golf tournament or the ACC
basketball championships. The wash is open year-round; there are
heaters in the building for the comfort of workers, who do not
dress warmly.
</P>
<P>
   Washes are $15 a car, competitive with other hand washes in the
area. The workers receive only tips, plus what they make from table
and couch dances in the car wash area _ $10 and $20, respectively.
In a corner of the shed, ``V.I.P. areas'' are set aside for private
dancing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the hours,'' said Tammy, 24, who declined to give her
last name. ``It's more laid back, and you get tan.'' In the summer,
cars are often washed outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, the car washers do not work after hours at the club,
and vice versa. ``It's hard to find enough pretty girls who want to
do the work,'' Collins said. Sometimes, however, he will punish a
club dancer by sending her to the car wash _ ``especially those
prima donnas who think they are too good to wash cars.''
</P>
<P>
   And the cars do come clean, to the surprise of a first-time
customer. After he parked his green Saturn and took a seat nearby,
two attendants, Ariel and Tiara, untrussed themselves and began
hosing the car with warm water. They used lamb's-wool mitts to
lather up the car, raising the windshield wipers and paying close
attention to the wheels. After rinsing, they dried the car with a
hand chamois. Given that Ariel managed these feats in thigh-high
patent leather stilettos, a $5 tip did not seem extravagant.

`UNICORN' IS SINGULARLY AND SADLY TRUE TO LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those still disgusted when seeing O.J. Simpson putt-putting
around golf courses, attending movie premieres and, well,
breathing, what's your take on Ira Einhorn? The mummified body of
Tyler native Holly Maddux was found stuffed into a trunk tucked in
the corner of Einhorn's back porch, reeking from 18 months of
decomposition. She'd been beaten by one or two heavy objects; her
skull was caved in.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested Einhorn and charged him with murder. That was 20
years ago. Where is Einhorn now? Last report had him in rural
France, where he's been living quite well, and quite free.
</P>
<P>
   The two-night, four-hour ``The Hunt for the Unicorn Killer'' (8
p.m. CDT, NBC) arrives Sunday and Monday, telling the absorbing
story of a sad affair that doesn't seem to have an end.
</P>
<P>
   This well-crafted NBC movie dramatizes the events that led to
Einhorn's dash out of the country and the initial legal and illegal
maneuvers that allowed him to escape capture. How he met Holly. How
he seduced, manipulated and systematically abused her. How she
became so drastically dependent on him that she sought therapy to
break the bond. How Einhorn became a legendary figure in
Philadelphia's political, social and intellectual circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hunt for the Unicorn Killer'' is based on a book by Steven
Levy, who had full cooperation from the Maddux family. It's upfront
about Einhorn's guilt. If anything, it's the movie's shedding of
Einhorn's layers that makes it fascinating to watch, particularly
as he dupes nearly everyone and constantly slithers just out of the
reach of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Einhorn was initially freed on bail when influential friends and
associates, believing his claims of government conspiracy, provided
him a top-notch attorney and convinced the presiding judge that he
wouldn't flee. But with a case building against him, he did.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, a Philadelphia jury convicted the fugitive Einhorn of
first-degree murder. But even after his arrest in France, the
French government has refused to extradite him, claiming that being
sentenced to life in prison, without being able to defend oneself,
is a violation of human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Einhorn, now 58, could very well elude U.S. prosecutors
altogether, particularly if ``The Hunt for the Unicorn Killer'' is
on target with its portrayal of the hippie guru as a kind of
seductive superman.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Anderson, last seen as the liberal priest on ``Nothing
Sacred,'' portrays Einhorn as a blend of hippie, intellectual,
creepy psychopath, con man and babe magnet. He's disarmingly
charming. Refusing to cut his shoulder-length hair and long,
scraggly beard even as the '60s ended, Einhorn was eccentric enough
to get noticed, smart enough to gain the respect of intellectuals,
politicians and rich business types, and sexually confident enough
to lure women into his bed almost at will.
</P>
<P>
   He adopted the Unicorn nickname in his writings for an
underground newspaper, even though by the 1970s he'd shifted
allegiance from peace and love to ``the powers of the mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Persuasion remained his forte, seduction his calling card. He
met Holly, played here by Naomi Watts, at a Philadelphia restaurant
in October 1972. A smart woman with high ideals and many dreams,
she was attending Bryn Mawr, from which Einhorn had graduated with
an English degree. Two weeks later, they were living together.
</P>
<P>
   Einhorn was the textbook abuser, one who chipped away at Holly's
self-esteem, deepening her dependence. Most everyone else loved
Einhorn. During his first prosecution, many respected
Philadelphians, from clergymen to a future U.S. senator, rallied to
his defense, admitting Einhorn's eccentricities but hardly deeming
him capable of murder.
</P>
<P>
   One scene shows him being summoned to end a war demonstration
that was about to turn violent. Einhorn walked in, took the
bullhorn, and asked the demonstrators to chill. They all sat down,
and started to sing before disbanding.
</P>
<P>
   Holly watched this and was filled with admiration. But Holly's
love _ or better yet, obsession _ with Einhorn merely showed the
hold he had on people in general, women in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson succeeds in portraying the character's insidious
nature, saddling him with the same creepy charisma that gave serial
killers such as Ted Bundy a trustworthy persona. Holly's sister,
Buffy Hall, who lives in Everman, calls it ``a hypnotic kind of
presence.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, even after he became psychologically abusive,
Holly wouldn't leave him for good. According to ``Unicorn Killer,''
Holly was picking up her things from the couple's shared apartment
when Einhorn decided that if he couldn't have her, no one would.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by William A. Graham (''Sleeping With the Devil'') and
written by Bruce Graham (''Anastasia''), ``Unicorn Killer'' has a
re-created scene showing Einhorn picking up an object and striking
Holly with unmitigated force.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, ``Unicorn Killer'' avoids the usual TV-movie tricks
of juggling the chronology of various events and changing names of
minor characters. Rather, it stays close to published accounts,
Hall says. When we talked by phone, she'd held off watching the
second part of the miniseries, having watched the first two hours
late at night so her children wouldn't see it.
</P>
<P>
   She does, however, call the characterization of her father,
(played by Tom Skerritt), who later killed himself with a shotgun
blast to the head, a composite; he was never quite the tireless
crusader the movie makes him out to be.
</P>
<P>
   But other than that, Hall calls what she'd seen ``unpleasantly
accurate,'' particularly Anderson's portrayal of Einhorn: ``I can
assure you that I'll never like watching him (Anderson) in anything
ever again.''

AT A CARWASH CONVENTION, SOFT SOAP MEETS THE HARD SELL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 9) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Minn., N.Y., Colo., Utah, Nev.)   (af)  
 By DAN NEIL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ A hypnotic fugue has fallen over the crowd
watching the Mac Neil RW-102s. The powerful water sprayers gyrate
frantically inside a stainless-steel cuff. Nearby, attached to an
overhead arch like you might see at a carwash, the nozzles stop and
turn, flip and churn, like choreographed stage lights at a Broadway
musical. People wobble their heads unconsciously as they watch the
water cannons dance.
</P>
<P>
   No running water has been supplied to the floor of the 1999
International Carwash Association's convention at the Opryland
Hotel here, but there is plenty of soft soap.
</P>
<P>
   Tearing his gaze from the Mac Neil device, Andy Malecha, a
representative of the Broadway Equipment Co. in Minneapolis, said:
``These things don't work any better than some guy with a hose. But
let's face it, car washing is subtle. We have to use a little
showmanship so people feel like they are getting their money's
worth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Subtle'' was definitely not on the list of adjectives
describing the convention floor here late last month, crowded with
more than 300 exhibitors hawking everything from hand-cranked coin
sorters to barn-size bus-washing robots.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a chronic shortage of labor in the $3 billion-a-year
carwash business, the industry relies heavily on automation. Dozens
of automatic carwash devices _ those familiar, antenna-eating
machines with the spinningbrushes _ are deployed on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Some are simple, bare-metal machines moving with the clumsy
kinetics of the elves in Saks's Christmas window displays, their
felt curtain ``mitters'' sloshing to and fro. Others look like
escaped set pieces from ``Starlight Express'': huge chrome and
glass naves with blinking neon signs and scrolling LED readouts
above the bill changers that take customers' money.
</P>
<P>
   Some machines are specialized, glumly slaving away at their
appointed tasks: dressing tires, for instance. Others roam from
bumper to bumper, their thick drum brushes whirling like Champions
on Ice.
</P>
<P>
   Econocraft Worldwide Manufacturing Inc. of the Bronx has brought
its ``Pizazz'' floor model, a 100-foot-long, $135,000 apparatus
whose mirrored chrome and candy-colored lights seem inspired by
somebody's favorite pachinko game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to spice it up, make it glitzy and glamorous,''
said Tim Hiller, the company's well-dressed representative. ``The
customer deserves it. He's paying $12 to $14 for a carwash. He
wants to see more than a little soap and water.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not charge less and offer a simpler machine? He acts as if
he has seen a gazelle run down the aisle. ``Why would we want to do
that?'' he asked. ``A wise old man told me never to leave any money
on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   A good carwash machine offers evidence of things unseen. Many of
the contraptions use flashing neon signs to indicate, for instance,
when the liquid called ``rust inhibitor'' _ its specific
ingredients are carefully guarded _ is applied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise, who would know what it was?'' asked Steve Chase of
Aurora, Colo., an inventor whose tri-color washing and waxing
agents are staples at many automated washes.
</P>
<P>
   At the Turtle Wax booth, Chase watches as a Saab 9-3 is
enveloped in rainbow ribbons of goopy spray. The stuff melts
together like the walls in a particularly lurid passage by William
Burroughs. In a touch of synesthesia, the area around the booth is
suffused with an intense berry fragrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice,'' he said, ``and it will keep customers in the
carwash longer.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the idea. Carwashes are expensive operations _ a
top-of-the-line machine can cost $165,000; the average investment
per bay in a conveyor carwash is about $1 million. Also, the
industry's effluent is federally regulated, requiring either a
separate sewer system for new carwashes, or water reclamation
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To increase revenue, the industry has made an art form of
``extra services,'' code for any frill that adds to the cost of a
visit. These can range from the reasonable (Armor-All tire
treatment makes the rubber look nice and shiny) to the ridiculous
(a lemon-scented sealer wax that would be worthwhile only if
passengers rode outside your car).
</P>
<P>
   In truth, consumers could probably skip the premium-priced car
vacuum, its festively colored ``fragrance enhancers'' bubbling up
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Another source of money is what falls under the rubric of
``profit centers.'' These can include everything from quick oil
changes and gasoline sales to car detailing and gift shops. Dozens
of vendors at the convention represent these peripheral retail
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more convenience we can give to the customer, the better
he likes it,'' said Guy W. Goddard, of Park City, Utah, the
president of the International Carwash Association. ``What we are
looking at is a transition from `carwash' to `car care.'''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, next year's convention in Las Vegas will be grandly
called the Car Care World Expo 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Goddard, who with his cowboy boots and long hair looks right at
home in Opryland, says the business will inevitably reach into
other services that busy people crave: dry cleaning, gourmet food
and coffee, insurance services, shoe repair, even massage
therapists _ ``duly licensed and registered,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As promising as the future looks _ the industry is growing 7
percent annually _ the business does have its problems: the rift
between ``friction'' and ``touch-free'' washes, for instance.
Friction washes put brushes or pads on cars. These can be worrisome
because the new clear-coat compounds applied over new cars' paint
can be easily marred by brushes, leaving telltale whorls.
</P>
<P>
   Touch-free carwashes use high-pressure sprays, but they are less
effective. To be competitive, some touch-free operators use
pre-soak solutions of hydrofluoric acid, a highly toxic material,
to loosen clay, brake dust and asphaltic hydrocarbons, otherwise
known as road tar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the industry to take the moral high ground,'' Goddard
said. ``We hope our membership avoids the stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   As in all things, the moral high ground is slippery. Goddard
said the industry's single greatest problem was that more than half
of all drivers still washed their own cars. These driveway washers
_ perhaps a million of them on a summer weekend day, by some
estimates _ send their waste water into the gutter, where it makes
its way into lakes and rivers. ``They can do with their waste water
what we can't,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the association's opposition to driveway washing _ which is
both green and self-serving _ means that it opposes charity washes
for churches and schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been developing a voucher system that charities can
sell, rather than wash cars in parking lots,'' Goddard said.
</P>
<P>
   Such controversies notwithstanding, the entrepreneurs of the
carwash industry seem an untroubled and gregarious lot. As they
trundled away from Nashville, they seemed to want nothing more than
to love the next big, noisy, soap-spitting machine. &QL;

PLANT'S SCHEDULE LEAVES EPILEPTIC WORKER OUT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(Undated) Robert Stevenson is an epileptic and is perfectly capable
of working, but he was fired from his job last year after working
27 years at the Simpson Pasadena Paper Co. in the Houston suburb of
Pasadena
</P>
<P>
   Like many industrial employers, Simpson went to a 12-hour
rotating shift several years ago, which required employees to work
some days and some nights. But Stevenson said the new schedule
triggered more seizures.
</P>
<P>
   Many epileptics need to take a regime of medicine every day at
the same time and get an adequate amount of sleep, especially when
they get older like Stevenson, who's 46. It's important to keep an
epileptic's blood levels even, so drug levels don't become toxic.
</P>
<P>
   So Stevenson went to his employers, seeking what he considered a
fairly simple accommodation: working the same straight eight-hour
shift five days a week without a lot of stress. It didn't matter if
it were a straight night shift or straight days.
</P>
<P>
   But Stevenson said the company fired him after saying it
couldn't give him what he wanted, even though there were several
hundred people working at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Simpson sold its plant to Belgravia Investments,
which changed the company's name to the Pasadena Paper Co.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Pawlicki, spokesman for Stevenson's former employer, the
Simpson Paper Co. in Sacramento, Calif., said the company won't
comment on personnel matters.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Blum, a neurologist in Pasadena who has been treating
Stevenson, said he talked to Simpson officials several times about
getting Stevenson back to work, but they wouldn't budge. Other
doctors sent similar pleas to Simpson officials.
</P>
<P>
   As you might expect, Stevenson's doctor is none too pleased with
his patient's treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Stevenson got completely screwed by the Simpson Paper
Co.,'' Blum said.
</P>
<P>
   Lex Frieden, co-director of the Americans with Disabilities Act
Technical Assistance Center at The Institute for Rehabilitation and
Research in Houston, said he isn't surprised to hear about
Stevenson's case. He has encountered many employers who don't want
to be flexible about work schedules _ even though it doesn't cost
them anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like having to build an elevator for three floors,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Frieden said he has seen many companies spend more money
fighting a request for an accommodation than providing one.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, H. Joan Ehrlich, district director of the U.S. Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission in Houston, said complaints about
failure to accommodate a disability are the most frequent type of
charges her office receives as enforcer of the Americans with
Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson said he has a charge pending before the EEOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never encountered an employer who was less resistant to
suggestions,'' Blum said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the company seemed to go out of its way to put
Stevenson in a stressful situation that could easily trigger more
seizures, Blum said.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months after he lost his 18-year-old son in a train
accident, Stevenson was assigned by Simpson officials to work in
the company's train yard, looking for trash in the rail cars
carrying wood chips. Stevenson said it was excruciating to walk up
and down the tracks _ he'd often go around the corner and cry _ and
said that the emotion he felt brought on several seizures.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how you define stress, putting an employee to work on
the rail cars after he lost his son to a train accident fits the
definition, Blum said. It's a matter of common sense.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as he waits for his EEOC complaint to work its way
through the system, Stevenson carries a pillbox in his shirt pocket
that beeps when it's time for his next dose of medicine. He loves
to recall headier times when his nickname at the quality control
lab was ``Eagle Eye Beater Bob.''
</P>
<P>

PLANT'S SCHEDULE LEAVES EPILEPTIC WORKER OUT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(Undated) Robert Stevenson is an epileptic and is perfectly capable
of working, but he was fired from his job last year after working
27 years at the Simpson Pasadena Paper Co. in the Houston suburb of
Pasadena
</P>
<P>
   Like many industrial employers, Simpson went to a 12-hour
rotating shift several years ago, which required employees to work
some days and some nights. But Stevenson said the new schedule
triggered more seizures.
</P>
<P>
   Many epileptics need to take a regime of medicine every day at
the same time and get an adequate amount of sleep, especially when
they get older like Stevenson, who's 46. It's important to keep an
epileptic's blood levels even, so drug levels don't become toxic.
</P>
<P>
   So Stevenson went to his employers, seeking what he considered a
fairly simple accommodation: working the same straight eight-hour
shift five days a week without a lot of stress. It didn't matter if
it were a straight night shift or straight days.
</P>
<P>
   But Stevenson said the company fired him after saying it
couldn't give him what he wanted, even though there were several
hundred people working at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Simpson sold its plant to Belgravia Investments,
which changed the company's name to the Pasadena Paper Co.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Pawlicki, spokesman for Stevenson's former employer, the
Simpson Paper Co. in Sacramento, Calif., said the company won't
comment on personnel matters.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Blum, a neurologist in Pasadena who has been treating
Stevenson, said he talked to Simpson officials several times about
getting Stevenson back to work, but they wouldn't budge. Other
doctors sent similar pleas to Simpson officials.
</P>
<P>
   As you might expect, Stevenson's doctor is none too pleased with
his patient's treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Stevenson got completely screwed by the Simpson Paper
Co.,'' Blum said.
</P>
<P>
   Lex Frieden, co-director of the Americans with Disabilities Act
Technical Assistance Center at The Institute for Rehabilitation and
Research in Houston, said he isn't surprised to hear about
Stevenson's case. He has encountered many employers who don't want
to be flexible about work schedules _ even though it doesn't cost
them anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like having to build an elevator for three floors,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Frieden said he has seen many companies spend more money
fighting a request for an accommodation than providing one.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, H. Joan Ehrlich, district director of the U.S. Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission in Houston, said complaints about
failure to accommodate a disability are the most frequent type of
charges her office receives as enforcer of the Americans with
Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson said he has a charge pending before the EEOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never encountered an employer who was less resistant to
suggestions,'' Blum said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the company seemed to go out of its way to put
Stevenson in a stressful situation that could easily trigger more
seizures, Blum said.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months after he lost his 18-year-old son in a train
accident, Stevenson was assigned by Simpson officials to work in
the company's train yard, looking for trash in the rail cars
carrying wood chips. Stevenson said it was excruciating to walk up
and down the tracks _ he'd often go around the corner and cry _ and
said that the emotion he felt brought on several seizures.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how you define stress, putting an employee to work on
the rail cars after he lost his son to a train accident fits the
definition, Blum said. It's a matter of common sense.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as he waits for his EEOC complaint to work its way
through the system, Stevenson carries a pillbox in his shirt pocket
that beeps when it's time for his next dose of medicine. He loves
to recall headier times when his nickname at the quality control
lab was ``Eagle Eye Beater Bob.''
</P>
<P>
   His disability has run out, he is ineligible for unemployment
checks and he no longer has health insurance. He is too healthy for
Social Security, so he is getting by on his savings. His medicine
costs him $375 a month, but luckily he got enough for five months
before his insurance was cut off.
</P>
<P>
   He can't drive and often walks five miles to his doctor's office
and another five miles back to save the $14 cab fare.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson, who lives in Pasadena, has applied for jobs as a
Postal Service worker and as a custodian for the city of Pasadena.
But so far the high school graduate hasn't received any offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's driving me crazy,'' said Stevenson, his voice cracking.
He's an able-bodied man who just wants a chance to work.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS PAY OFF IN PERFORMANCE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 9) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill., Ark.)   (af)  
 By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Setting up an employee stock ownership plan improves companies'
financial performance, and not just staff morale, according to a
new study of the plans by Hewitt Associates, a consulting firm
based in Lincolnshire, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The study examined the performance of all 382 publicly traded
companies that adopted such plans, known as ESOPs, from 1971
through 1995. The average company in the study improved the annual
return on its stock by 6.9 percentage points and the return on
assets by 2.7 percentage points after establishing its plan.
</P>
<P>
   An ESOP acquires or is granted significant holdings of company
stock on employees' behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The study suggested one possible reason why starting an ESOP
might improve performance: Employees are typically told more than
they were before about how the company is doing, better equipping
them to make decisions that help the company they now partly own.
</P>
<P>
   Eight out of 10 companies said they share information with
workers for this reason, and two-thirds of the total said they saw
direct benefits.
</P>
<P>
   At Baldor Electric, a motor manufacturer in Fort Smith, Ark., a
plan that grew in 1996 to cover almost all employees has made
workers feel closer to the goals and future of the company,
according to Lloyd Davis, the chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the big issues in the workplace is not `how much money
I make,''' Davis said. ``It's an issue of security, of belonging.''
He said that the benefits for morale show up in Baldor's frequent
high standing in ``best companies to work for'' surveys and that
operating margins have been improving gradually since the plan was
expanded.
</P>
<P>
   Corey Rosen, director of the National Center for Employee
Ownership, said the findings of the Hewitt study echoed those of
smaller, earlier studies. The average company in the Hewitt study
had 17,000 employees and annual sales of $2.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best-known ESOPs have been started to help rescue
faltering companies, with employees trading wage and work-rule
concessions for equity stakes. But Rosen said such cases were the
exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``ESOPs are almost never a substitute for compensation,'' he
said, noting that wages at companies with the plans are typically 5
percent to 12 percent higher than industry averages.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Rosen said publicly traded companies were turning
away from ESOPs in favor of granting stock options, because of more
favorable accounting treatment.

NOT DOING WHAT THE ROMANS DO  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 9) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mich., N.Y., Conn., Ore., Calif., Canada)   (af)  
 By CAROL STEINBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Kay Ainsley of Detroit traveled to Saudi Arabia several
years ago to sell the rights to open Domino's Pizza shops there,
she felt the full force of being a woman in a man's land.
</P>
<P>
   Her business visa was rejected twice, she said, before the
intervention of the Saudi businessman with whom she planned to
negotiate. Then she arrived at a low-rise office building in Jidda
to find that employees near the meeting room had been cleared away
because of her presence.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a business suit, she was asked to cover herself with
an abaya, or traditional long black robe, for lunch at the
businessman's home. In scouting the competition, Ms. Ainsley, then
Domino's director of international development, found that a local
sandwich shop didn't allow women to enter, so she had to peer into
a window and have male colleagues fetch take-out.
</P>
<P>
   In a global economy, United States business people are learning
how to grin and bear many overseas cultural challenges. And women
often face added obstacles, especially where business is still
almost entirely conducted by men.
</P>
<P>
   Recent research suggests that only about one of every 8 or 10
managers assigned abroad by American corporations are women. But as
more companies and more female executives see other women
succeeding overseas, and recognize that such jobs can speed
advancement, more women are likely to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Businesses in the U.S. have wrestled with their desire,
honestly, to assign women who are otherwise qualified to work
overseas,'' said Bill Carmell of Winston &AMP; Strawn in New York, a
labor lawyer for management. ``Part of the problem, though, for
them has been the acceptance of that in some countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Darlene Orlov, a work-force consultant in New York specializing
in sexual harassment, said some employers were quietly allowing
potential cultural clashes to influence their choices for foreign
jobs. ``We all know it's illegal to allow your customer preference
for gender or race to determine who will be assigned to that
business,'' she said of United States companies. ``However, people
still consider, `Can we send a person into an environment where the
customer might not be responsive?'''
</P>
<P>
   Although Saudi Arabia is still regarded as among the toughest
places for an American woman to conduct business, Ms. Ainsley, now
a senior consultant with Michael H. Seid &AMP; Associates of West
Hartford, Conn., said she would go back. But even she would advise
clients otherwise. All things being equal, she said, ``I'd probably
assign a project to a male _ it would be easier for them to get
business done.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge is to be sensitive to a culture, but not
mimic it, said Nancy Adler, a professor of international management
at McGill University in Montreal. ```When in Rome do as the Romans'
do is not particularly good advice, and it's horrible advice for
women in many cultures,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When abroad, American businesswomen can circumvent some local
customs by making it clear they are different from local women. A
Japanese-American in Japan, for example, should clarify up front
that she was born, say, in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Women often must strive to be taken seriously. Sue Roll of
Gaston, Ore., a human resources manager at the Intel Corp., was
ignored for 45 minutes while meeting with an employee training
agency in Shanghai. Only after her male peers repeatedly turned to
her and said, ``Sue, you're in charge,'' was her authority
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Women coach female colleagues to signal their importance by
displaying knowledge and having top executives send introductory
letters, make calls and accompany them to meet clients. For small
companies, a United States consulate or industry group can open
doors. Women are also sometimes advised to travel business class
and stay in good hotels as symbols of their status.
</P>
<P>
   As for building relationships, ``the biggest mistake made by
women is assuming they have to act identically to males,'' Ms.
Adler said. Referring to foreign habits of heavy after-hours
drinking, she said, ``We have a quiet joke that it's possible to be
highly successful as a woman in Asia without losing your liver.''
</P>
<P>
   Covering Asia from Hong Kong until recently as a
customer-service executive for Lucent Technologies, Edith Parham
Melton was included in dinners in Japan. But then male colleagues,
Japanese and American, would drop her off at her hotel and go
drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Developing rapport through other social opportunities, like
lunches or dinners, can work better than protesting such exclusion.
``It didn't impede the business relationship, but it took longer,''
Ms. Melton said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, women have also found that even a casual comment can
be misinterpreted. At a dinner in Japan, a male client told Jane
Echols, who has a public relations firm in San Francisco, that her
children must miss her when she travels. When she replied that her
husband stayed home with them, ``he was dumbfounded,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His image of me became someone who could overpower men,'' Ms.
Echols said. ``It distracted him.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are often basic strategies for coping with, while
still respecting, foreign customs. In Pakistan, for example, it is
possible to evade the taboo against meeting with a man behind
closed doors by keeping the door open or meeting as a group.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Ainsley completed her Saudi deal, she kept silent
when she was banned from the contract signing at a palace in
Riyadh, where her boss, a man, signed instead. ``I wasn't there to
revolutionize their culture,'' she said.

<P>
   John Schreiber may resemble an advertising executive in some
ways, but his casually rumpled look is clearly not one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 70 degrees outside,'' said Keith Ritter, a senior vice
president at CBS Sports, welcoming Schreiber, 44, the founder and
president of the John Schreiber Group, into his mid-Manhattan
office one recent afternoon. ``What's with the corduroys?''
</P>
<P>
   Ritter was kidding, of course. After all, he had hired Schreiber
_ whose round glasses and erudite manner suggest a literature
professor _ precisely because he turns convention on its head.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter oversees CBS's sponsorship of NASCAR, a stock-car racing
licenser, and the day's task was to put the finishing touches on
NASCAR Rocks, a music tour featuring the Allman Brothers that
Schreiber had designed to expand both stock-car racing's growing
audience and CBS's involvement with the sport.
</P>
<P>
   In an advertising-saturated society, corporations increasingly
come to people like Schreiber to develop such campaigns. A leader
in the relatively young field of entertainment marketing, he works
with clients like American Express, Philip Morris and the Hard Rock
Cafe to bring a new dimension to their brands. His Manhattan firm,
which he runs with two partners and 30 employees, projects 1999
billings of $14 million.
</P>
<P>
   Schreiber is the brain behind the Toyota Comedy Festival, the
premier gathering of its kind in the nation. (This year's event is
June 3-12 at sites around the city; the main event is Ray Romano at
Carnegie Hall.) The seven-year-old festival stands out because of
Laugh Well, a program Schreiber added in 1995 to send comics into
local hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a Toyota-sponsored benefit starring the comedian
Steven Wright at Morristown Hospital in New Jersey raised $70,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the difference between what we do and what I call
slap-on sponsorships,'' Schreiber said. ``I like to do things where
one and one equals three, where everybody wins.''
</P>
<P>
   His clients champion him for keeping his eye on the ball.
``Other people got focused on the idea that we were doing NASCAR
Rocks simply as a concert series,'' Ritter said. ``John immediately
understood that we wanted a really cool entertainment experience,
but that it also had to serve a broader marketing goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Schreiber's feel for quality entertainment, unusual in his
bottom-line-oriented industry, is rooted in his background. The
Queens-born son of a jazz-loving father in the construction
business and a mother who did volunteer work, he began arranging
music events in the early 1970s as a student at Haverford in
suburban Philadelphia, ``a little Quaker college where nobody goes
into show business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Marian McPartland, the British jazz pianist, offered to
introduce him to George Wein, impresario of the Newport and Kool
jazz festivals, he jumped at the chance.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, shortly after graduating, Schreiber was hired by Wein's
Festival Productions and was introduced to Dizzy Gillespie, Charles
Mingus and Ella Fitzgerald. ``The first month I was there, I was at
the jazz festival in Nice, running the stage with all these music
heroes of mine,'' he said. ``I thought to myself, `I have died and
gone to heaven.'''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to his early career, his home life now seems oddly
quiet. He lists reading, jogging and music as his main pastimes; he
met his wife, Debra Simon, head of marketing for the Alliance for
Downtown New York, when she worked for him as a producer. Married
four years, they live in Manhattan with their 2-year-old son, Ben.
``What we do for fun,'' he said, ``is hang out with the baby.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the early 1980s, he produced some 20 jazz festivals for
Wein, crediting his former boss with teaching him that
``corporations have the ability, by virtue of their objectives and
their pockets, to make valuable things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   When American Express asked him in the mid-1980s to come up with
a strategy that would build brand loyalty among premium-card
holders, he came up with Gold Card Events and Platinum Card by
Invitation, programs offering prime seats to entertainment events.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very careful about what Gold Card seating was,'' he
recalled in an interview at his firm's cramped offices near Times
Square. ``We would sometimes go to the performances, see where the
members were and ask them if they were happy with their seats.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, during the stand-up comedy craze, he had an idea to
hold a comedy festival in New York but knew that he would need
backers. The region's Toyota dealers are particularly pleased with
the idea, especially Laugh Well, the local charitable connection.
</P>
<P>
   After Schreiber started his own company in 1995, he kept a hand
in the comedy festival, of which he is co-producer, with Wein and
Alan King. Since then, he has juggled projects varying from ``Hard
Rock Live,'' the televised concert series he produces for Hard Rock
Cafe and VH-1, to National Public Radio's 25th anniversary
celebration at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   One client might open him to controversy _ Philip Morris, with
which he produces Club Benson &AMP; Hedges, a rhythm-and-blues series
in clubs around the country.Tobacco companies, shut out of most
advertising channels, need new ones.
</P>
<P>
   But Patrick Reynolds, of the Foundation for a Smoke-Free
America, said, ``Such events lend an aura of respectability and
caring about the community when in fact they are aggressively
marketing their deadly products.''
</P>
<P>
   Schreiber is unapologetic. ``That's a first-class program,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He sees beauty in the variety of his work. ``Half of what I do
is stuff I'm passionately interested in as a guy, the other half is
as a guy who thinks of himself as a smart marketer,'' he said.
``We're like glass blowers _ everything is different.''

SPHERES OF EXUBERANCE: `BUBBLEOLOGY' FLOATS TO NEW HEIGHTS

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Give 5-year-old Shelby Hulitt a bottle of
slimy, soapy bubbles and a hot-pink wand and she'll burst into
laughter within seconds. Bubbles have that magical appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls and boys love bubbles. Adults love bubbles. They're so
fascinating,'' says Marla Wolf, an Aledo
teacher-turned-bubble-scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Even the smallest kids can create huge, rainbow bubbles with
today's nifty bubble blowers. Toy companies are dipping into
success with wacky bubble tubes, battery-operated wands and
character toys, such as Rugrats and Mr. Potato Head.
</P>
<P>
   The science of ``bubbleology' is so dazzling to children, Fort
Worth Clean City's Camp Earth has a class devoted to it. The Fort
Worth school district also teaches a bubble course in its Dare to
Discover summer program. Third-graders at Camp Earth become
``bubbleologists,'' learning about cohesion, surface tension and
more, Wolf says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many science concepts related to bubbles:
sublimation, surface tension, color spectrum, cohesion,'' explains
Wolf, who teaches the bubble course at Camp Earth. ``If the child
doesn't remember the concepts, maybe they'll remember the
activity.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to exploring kinds and sizes of bubbles, kids learn
how to create bubble blowers with everyday household items like
sieves, colanders, soup cans and slotted spoons. Solo plastic
plates and aluminum pie tins are great to dip bubble solution out
of.
</P>
<P>
   For noncrafty parents, the toy industry makes it easy and
relatively inexpensive. Among the hottest-selling bubble products
are those made by Koosh. New this year are Rugrats Micro Bubbles
(which create hundreds of tiny bubbles, $2.99), Mr. Potato Head
Bubble Fun (with eight removable parts that turn into wands,
$6.99), and Jumba Bubba (a giant battery-operated wand, $12.99).
</P>
<P>
   Little Kids has a fun collection of zany tubes, character wands,
twirly straws, no-spill tumblers and other creative products,
priced from $3 to $25. Little Kids' Silly Face bubble blowers
create big laughs. Shaped like oversized plastic lips with a
built-in bubble blower wand, these allow youngsters to make silly
faces while blowing hundreds of bubbles.

 &HT;    ACCIDENTS AND HOMICIDES KILLING HEALTHY YOUNG AMERICANS
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A century of improvements in sanitation, public
health and medicine has produced a generation of healthy American
children whose worst dangers are guns, cars and drugs, a private
health policy group said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``As America enters the 21st century, the nation is
unsuccessfully confronting the most difficult hazards to the health
of its children,'' the Public Health Policy Advisory Board said
following a yearlong study.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, founded recently by former Health and Human
Services Secretary Louis Sullivan, said the public must begin
discussing ``difficult issues'' that cannot be solved with
medicines and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the turn of the (20th) century, spectacular successes in
the prevention and treatment of injury and disease have
dramatically demonstrated the value of focused public health
interventions,'' the board's report on ``Health and the American
Child'' stated. It said mortality rates for children have dropped
over 90 percent since 1900.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet today's children face new hazards of a changed era.
Despite the enormous consequences for our nation and its economy,
we lack a comprehensive national framework to help set goals and
target resources to enhance children's safety and physical and
mental health.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of disease like smallpox, measles and diarrhea,
Americans under 20 are most likely to die of accidents, homicides
and suicides, the board said. Accidents accounted for 42 percent of
all deaths in this age group in 1995, the report stated, and nearly
two-thirds of these deaths involved motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Homicides and suicides accounted for 14 percent and 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increasingly, homicide and suicide pose some of the biggest
risks to children in this nation,'' said Maria J. New, chairman of
Department of Pediatrics of Cornell University Medical Center and a
member of the new organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to recognize that the sad events in Littleton,
Colorado, are indicative of larger trends in teenage violence,''
she said. ``While children once faced the greatest threats from
diseases like polio and smallpox, threats to children's health now
relate more to social, cultural and behavioral changes in
society.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's children face new hazards of a changed era,'' said
Sullivan, now president of Morehouse Medical School in Atlanta.
``This report serves as a wake-up call to parents, schools,
religious and community groups and policy-makers. Our nation needs
to recognize what is really putting our children at risk and
respond with a comprehensive strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Public Health Policy Advisory Board describes itself as a
nonpartisan public health organization established to advance
``sound, science-based policy-making in public health.'' Its
funding comes from ``unrestricted grants'' from industry,
government and other nonprofit organizations.

SURVEYS SHOW AMERICANS IN A FUNK OVER SCHOOL SHOOTINGS, KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Voters are expressing a new sense of pessimism over
America's future in the wake of the high school massacre in
Littleton, Colo., and the conflict over Kosovo, a Democratic
pollster said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The pollster, Celinda Lake, told reporters that her
Washington-based consulting firm interviewed 100 voters in
so-called focus groups of 10 each in Seattle, Denver, Oklahoma
City, Los Angeles and Baltimore over the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of every 10 participants described their view of the
nation's present and future in negative terms, using such words as
anxious, depressed, disappointed and confused, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, only half the participants or fewer used such
words, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's noticeable is a profound shift in the mood of the
public,'' Lake said. ``In every focus group, there's never more
than one person who has something positive to say.''
</P>
<P>
   The shift, if it holds up, will have profound implications for
candidates in the 2000 race, she said, predicting that Vice
President Al Gore, the Democratic frontrunner, cannot expect the
high-flying economy to propel him to victory, as it did in 1996 for
President Clinton and him.
</P>
<P>
   The feelings of depression have ``ended any hope of (Gore's)
being able to run on `four more years,''' Lake said.
</P>
<P>
   To have any chance, Gore must ``define a separate and
contemporary agenda that's responsive to the problems,'' she
insisted.
</P>
<P>
   But she added that the public's negative feelings have ``upped
the leadership ante for (Texas Gov. George W.) Bush,'' the
Republican frontrunner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's living on borrowed time,'' she said. ``He cannot sit in
Texas on the general assumption that a governor ... knows how to
run the country. He's going to have to demonstrate it. That's going
to be tougher. When he engages (voters), he's got nowhere to go but
down''
</P>
<P>
   Lake said the public's pessimism stems from the April 20
shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., which left
15 dead, and the air war in Yugoslavia, which started March 24.
</P>
<P>
   The concern over Kosovo has less to do with international
relations, human rights and U.S. leadership than with the military
effort's cost, she said. Focus group participants were worried that
it will eat up the budget surplus, leaving little money for Social
Security or other domestic concerns, Lake said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would just like to be going into the 21st century in
better shape,'' she said, noting that 72 percent of the focus group
participants said the country is heading in the wrong direction
culturally and morally.
</P>
<P>
   Polls and focus groups often are simply snapshots of the public
mood that may quickly change. Analysts often cite Governor Bush's
father, former President George Bush, whose poll numbers were high
in 1991 after the Persian Gulf War but who lost the election in
1992 to then Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But Lake insisted the trend that surfaced in her latest round of
focus groups may be longer lasting. She said congressional
Democrats scored political points by seizing the gun issue and
introducing proposals Thursday to put safety locks on hand guns and
regulate gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that even in traditionally pro-gun areas of the South
and the Rocky Mountain states, a gender gap is surfacing with women
increasingly supporting controls while men oppose them, she said.

CADILLAC'S FIRST TRUCK IS DESTINED FOR BESTSELLDOM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first truck in the 96-year history of the Cadillac brand is
destined to be a bestseller for General Motors' otherwise stagnant
luxury-vehicle line.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1999 Escalade isn't a new vehicle. It's a gussied-up GMC
Yukon/Chevrolet Tahoe, built alongside the others at GM's plant in
Arlington, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Because Cadillac dealers were screaming to GM for a
sport-utility vehicle to battle the highly popular Lincoln
Navigator and to entice people under retirement age into their
showrooms, GM rushed the Escalade from concept to market in less
than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Plans originally were to wait until the new-generation Suburban,
Tahoe and Yukon debuted this fall to roll out a Cadillac
sport-utility vehicle, but dealers insisted that they get an SUV
sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Even though there was a rush to bring the Escalade to showrooms,
GM didn't cut any corners. This vehicle is a worthy competitor for
the Navigator and other vehicles in the burgeoning full-size SUV
market segment, which includes the Range Rover, Isuzu Trooper/Acura
SLX and Toyota Land Cruiser/Lexus LX 470.
</P>
<P>
   My significant other, who is a great fan of full-size SUVs,
pronounced the Escalade her favorite among the class. ``Tell them
we're not giving it back, just to send us the payment book,'' she
said during our week with the Escalade.
</P>
<P>
   But at a list price of $45,875 (plus $640 transportation), it
had to go back, even though I didn't want it to. I have children to
feed.
</P>
<P>
   This is the ultimate Yukon or Tahoe, complete with comfortable
perforated leather seats (a bit cooler on the backside than solid
leather seats in hot climates like Texas'), rugged yet refined
four-wheel drive (suited for any driving conditions, including deep
snow or off-road mountain climbing), a built-in satellite
navigation system linked to live operators at GM's OnStar
communications center (they can unlock your doors by satellite
remote control if you lock yourself out of the vehicle), and a
255-horsepower V-8 engine that pushes this vehicle along with the
best of them.
</P>
<P>
   As a lifelong off-road driving aficionado, I appreciate that GM
kept the great off-road attributes of the Tahoe and Yukon in the
Escalade. The only differences are the highway tires that come
standard on the Escalade and a slightly softer suspension. If you
want to do some serious exploring, you can put off-road tires on
the Escalade, but even the stock tires will work for mild
off-roading. The Escalade, like the four-wheel-drive versions of
the Tahoe and Yukon, even has a low-range gearbox setting for
serious hill-climbing. And unlike the Tahoe and Yukon, the Escalade
is not offered in a cheaper two-wheel-drive version.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I understand that most Escalade buyers won't take
their vehicles off-road, but I'm sure they will appreciate that the
vehicle can handle the wilderness if they ever want to go.
</P>
<P>
   The Escalade will mostly be an around-town family hauler and
on-the-road travel machine, perhaps pulling a horse trailer,
sailboat or camper. It can tow up to 6,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   What the Escalade does for Cadillac dealers is perhaps its most
significant achievement. It brings baby boomers into showrooms for
the first time. Cadillac hopes that some of those boomers will pass
on the Escalade and buy another Cadillac product such as the
Seville STS _ a truly remarkable vehicle that they might never have
considered if they hadn't been drawn into the dealership by the big
SUV.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln is finding that to be true of its Navigator. People who
wouldn't have considered visiting a Lincoln showroom before the
Navigator are coming in now and driving away in other Lincolns.
</P>
<P>
   My only complaint with the Escalade is the same one I have with
the Tahoe and Yukon equipped with heated seats. The switch for the
driver's seat heater is on the lower left side of the seat near the
seat-position controls, completely out of sight. It is easily
bumped on while adjusting the seat, and within minutes, the driver
begins melting away. The first time I drove a Tahoe, I accidentally
turned on the seat heater and had to stop the car a few minutes
later, take the owner's manual from the glovebox, and figure out
where the switch was so I could turn it off.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   Like the Tahoe and Yukon, the Escalade is a shortened version of
the Suburban, the national car of Texas. That means that it doesn't
have room for a third seat; consumers have to choose one of its
competitors to get that feature. A third seat is available in the
Navigator and Land Cruiser/LX 470, as well as in the smaller but
also competitive Mercedes-Benz M-class.
</P>
<P>
   The Escalade seats five full-size adults in comfort, and there
is 66.9 cubic feet of cargo space available behind the rear seat.
Fold the rear seat down and that space expands to 118.2 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   The 5.7-liter V-8 engine is the only power plant offered, but it
is more than adequate for this vehicle. As heavy as it is _ nearly
5,573 pounds _ the Escalade can go from zero to 60 mph in 10.5
seconds. The transmission is a smooth-shifting four-speed automatic
with overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   Escalade's top speed is 110 mph, and even at highway speeds, the
vehicle handles rather well. Among the standard features are
speed-sensitive power steering and four-wheel antilock brakes.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, passengers ride in the luxury and comfort they would
expect from a Cadillac, even though it is a truck. The Escalade is
elegant, but unlike many Cadillac cars of the past, the elegance
isn't ridiculously overdone.
</P>
<P>
   All controls are within easy reach of the driver, and gauges are
large and easy to read.
</P>
<P>
   Standard is a Bose Acoustimass music system with cassette and
single compact-disc players in the dash, as well as a six-disc
remote CD changer. There are four speakers in the doors, two in the
headliner and a subwoofer in the console. Rear-seat passengers have
their own stereo controls and headphones so they can listen
privately to something different from what is being played up
front.
</P>
<P>
   Automatic climate control isn't offered on the Escalade; it uses
the same manual heating/air-conditioning system that comes with the
Suburban, Tahoe and Yukon. There is a separate control for the rear
fan, however.
</P>
<P>
   Most other luxury features are standard, including power
windows/mirrors/door locks, automatic-dimming mirrors, high-tech
theft-deterrent system, running boards for easy entry/exit, remote
locking/unlocking, front and rear consoles, eight cupholders,
10-way power driver and passenger seats, leather-wrapped steering
wheel and cruise control.
</P>
<P>
   The Escalade comes fully loaded, so there are no options
offered. Total sticker is $46,515, including transportation.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings are about average for this class: 13
miles per gallon in the city and 16 mpg on the highway. The tank
holds 30 gallons of gasoline, and regular unleaded is recommended.

 &HT;    FIRED CNN PRODUCER SUES NETWORK AND CONFIDENTIAL SOURCE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (e) entertainment categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ April Oliver, the former TV producer who was fired
by CNN after the news network retracted her controversial
documentary on Operation Tailwind last year, fired back at her
detractors Friday with a pair of lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver filed a claim against her former employer, charging that
she had been wrongfully dismissed, and filed a defamation
countersuit against retired U.S. Army General John Singlaub. The
countersuit identified Singlaub, who led covert forces during the
Vietnam War, as ``a confidential source for the Tailwind report.''
</P>
<P>
   The legal actions came after a preliminary hearing in Singlaub's
own defamation lawsuit against CNN and Oliver stemming from the
June 7, 1998, report. The story claimed that covert U.S. forces had
used a deadly nerve gas and targeted American defectors in a secret
1970 raid on a jungle camp in Laos.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver has stood behind the report despite CNN's retraction and
widespread criticism that it was flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver said Singlaub's lawsuit effectively ended her agreement
not to publicly identify him as a source who provided information
for the story, which launched the joint CNN-Time magazine Sunday
night show ``NewsStand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Singlaub shattered our confidentiality contract,'' she said.
``First, he told the public he wasn't a source. Then, at a Pentagon
press conference in July, he told the world he was a source, but
had always denied the story. Then he filed suit against me. These
actions nullify our agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   In the countersuit filed in District of Columbia Superior Court,
Oliver said she had interviewed Singlaub six times in connection
with the Tailwind report and took detailed notes at each meeting.
Afterward, the document said, Singlaub joined in attacks on the
report and filed a suit ``alleging that Oliver has defamed him by
reporting the very information that he, on condition of
confidentiality, had confirmed to her.''
</P>
<P>
   In his own legal filings, Singlaub denies confirming that nerve
gas was used in Operation Tailwind or that the mission was aimed at
finding and killing U.S. defectors in Laos. Indeed, he said he was
not involved at all and was defamed by the CNN report, which
implied he commanded the unconventional forces that carried out the
mission.
</P>
<P>
   While Oliver and CNN were united in defense against Singlaub's
charges of defamation Friday, the 36-year-old producer charged
after the hearing that her bosses had ``hung me out to dry'' when
the military community challenged the report. Oliver and
co-producer Jack Smith were fired shortly after the report was
shown, and the on-air correspondent, Peter Arnett, parted ways with
the cable news network several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   In her suit against the network, Oliver said she was made a
scapegoat. CNN did not ``terminate the employment'' of
``supervisory executives, editors and managers who reviewed the
Tailwind report and were responsible for the decision to air the
piece, including CNN executives Tom Johnson, Rick Kaplan, David
Kohler, John Lane, Frank Sesno, Pam Hill and Jim Connor,'' the
document said.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver said she not only lost her $60,000-a-year job, but that
derogatory remarks made by some of her former bosses ``have hurt my
career very badly.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit against CNN ``is an opportunity to get the facts of the
case out there,'' she said in an interview. ``There has been a lot
of misinformation, and really character assassination. It is
important for people who know who made the decisions on this
piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the lawsuit, a CNN spokesperson said, ``We do not
comment on matters of litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing Friday, attorneys agreed on a schedule that would
extend the case well into next year. And Singlaub is only one of
several Vietnam veterans who have filed suits against CNN, its
parent company Time-Warner Inc., Oliver, Arnett and others involved
in the report about Operation Tailwind.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For a country with a high decibel level and a habit of
confrontation _ a national penchant for guns, litigation, divorce,
in-your-face discourse and ax-thwacking employee downsizing _
America has a surprising appetite for books about talking things
over quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiation guides may be rooted in business or law, but they
have great crossover potential these days. A recent sighting: In
the March 28 issue of The New York Times Magazine, G. Richard
Shell, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton
School of Business and author of ``Bargaining for Advantage,'' soon
to be published by Viking, interviewed Richard Butler, the chief
United Nations arms inspector, about what was described as ``Saddam
Hussein, 2-year-old children and the art of getting one's way.''
</P>
<P>
   The one-size-fits-all approach to dealing with people has a
history, according to two of Shell's colleagues at Penn. In
America, ``this straddle has always been there between what works
in business and what works with personal relations,'' said Michael
Zuckerman, a historian.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, he said, Dale Carnegie and his 1937 ur-guide, ``How to
Win Friends and Influence People,'' or Benjamin Franklin and his
worldly-wise ``Autobiography.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the stock market ``a national obsession,'' said Jerry
Jacobs, who teaches sociology, business is increasingly ``where all
our metaphors are coming from.'' A pattern of working at home adds
to the trend, he said, and ``there's an interesting blurring going
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Three new books on negotiating and resolving conflicts
contribute, in varying degrees, to that blurring.
</P>
<P>
   In my local bookstore, ``Difficult Conversations: How to Discuss
What Matters Most'' (Viking, $24.95), by Douglas Stone, Bruce
Patton and Sheila Heen of the Harvard Negotiation Project, pops up
in three places: on the general-interest tables, among the business
books and in the self-improvement display, rubbing spines with
``How to Succeed With Women.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane von Mehren, the book's editor at Viking, said the ubiquity
is intentional: ``We wanted to grow the book beyond the traditional
business-book market,'' which she sees as ``potentially lucrative,
but somewhat limited.'' The aim is to create another blockbuster
like ``Getting to Yes,'' the Harvard group's 1981 hit negotiating
guide, by Roger Fisher and Patton.
</P>
<P>
   But enough about marketing. What about making sense? Does this
book deliver on the jacket's promise of an effective way through
sticky situations whether ``with your baby sitter or your biggest
client''?
</P>
<P>
   It does. But be advised that the ``Harvard Method,'' as this
style of communicating is known, requires insight, a certain
comfort level with psychology and, for best results, a willing,
not-too-neurotic talking partner. It's a method a marriage
counselor might use.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly, ``Difficult Conversations'' theorizes that each
difficult conversation (fighting about a family will, laying off an
employee, visiting a child's concerned teacher) is really three
simultaneous communications.
</P>
<P>
   There's the ``what happened'' conversation, with its competing
versions of reality and import. There's the ``feelings''
conversation, with unacknowledged emotions running amok and
therefore running the show. And there's the ``identity''
conversation, a parallel internal monologue about one's own guilt
or sense of self in the matter at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Carefully, and with less jargon that you might expect,
``Difficult Conversations'' unpacks each of these, using credible
examples from work and personal life. The aim is to explore ``each
other's stories'' (there's that jargon) in a kind of mutually
therapeutic way, while acknowledging, and thus taming, emotional
reactions and taking note of inner self-doubts about what the
argument ``means'' about us. That way, we can stop being defensive
and move the conversation along.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is silly, and much of it is smart. And ``Difficult
Conversations'' wisely stays away from inappropriate arenas _
merger talks, say, or global diplomacy. Still, it's difficult to
imagine a company full of ``aware'' employees. (``Oh, there's Al
from accounting _ he is, like, so stuck in his identity story.'')
</P>
<P>
   Negotiating in the Real World: Getting the Deal You Want''
(Simon &AMP; Schuster, $24), by Victor Gotbaum, also gives advice by
drawing from both business and personal life: Gotbaum was a labor
leader who for decades headed New York City's huge municipal
employees' union, and he even discusses his own ``long, drawn-out
divorce'' as an example of a negotiation that failed.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly, Gotbaum's principles here are familiar, though there's a
good section on how ultimatums can lead to disasters like the
baseball strike of the mid-1990s. And because of the book's abrupt
transitions and lack of contextual detail _ dates are omitted in a
number of anecdotes _ there is no vivid sense of time or place.
</P>
<P>
   Gotbaum has some juicy stories to tell and lots of blunt
opinions about the New York mayors he has tangled with, but he
misses many opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The focus is narrower in ``The Keys to Conflict Resolution:
Proven Methods of Resolving Disputes Voluntarily'' (Four Walls
Eight Windows, $22), by Theodore W. Kheel. The jacket talks of
``convincing the neighbor to mow the lawn at a normal hour,'' but
the book mainly distills the experiences of its author, a national
labor official who also mediated in business, civil rights and
municipal crises, often at the behest of presidents, governors and
mayors.
</P>
<P>
   The book has a quaint elder-statesman quality, with quotes from
the Bible, Shakespeare and Robert Burns, and draws examples from
fields as varied as global trade and baseball. But Kheel's advice
is not as interesting as his ruminations on former New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo and on the tangled history of New York City's
newspapers, including the bizarre negotiations surrounding Rupert
Murdoch's 1988 sale of The New York Post.

ANNUALS THAT MAKE LAZY GARDENERS LOOK GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, May 9)  
(mk) 
 By PATRICIA A. TAYLOR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Through sheer laziness, I had a beautiful retaining-wall garden
last year.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm confident that I will again this year because of the
glories of long-blooming, self-seeding annuals.
</P>
<P>
   These are plants that don't want to quit. They flower all summer
and often into fall. Then they return the next year, with no effort
on my part, like perennials repeating their superb performance all
over again.
</P>
<P>
   Until I had that gray stone retaining wall built to level some
ground in front of my house for a garden, annuals were not a
significant part of my horticultural life. I felt that they
required too much time and expense because they had to be bought
and planted every year.
</P>
<P>
   It was only because the foot-high wall was in the front that I
decided to use a large display of annuals. They would provide
instant color above the wall's curved, 24-foot length, giving me
time to decide what perennials to use.
</P>
<P>
   I looked for plants that would stand no more than a foot tall,
so that they wouldn't overwhelm the wall. With potted annuals in
full bloom at garden centers by mid-May, it was easy to search for
the colors I wanted _ light blues, soft yellows, creamy whites and
blush pinks.
</P>
<P>
   To have easy-care flowers, I chose dwarf ageratums and
marigolds. The marigolds had lemon yellow flowers, a pleasant
surprise because I had long assumed that they came only in garish
colors.
</P>
<P>
   Serendipity joined my search when I came across flats of Crystal
White zinnia. Though I had never seen these small-flowered zinnias,
a Kansas City friend had told me of their long flowering period and
resistance to mildew.
</P>
<P>
   These traits, plus the plant's tolerance for heat and drought,
earned it a place as a 1997 All-America Selections winner, a
distinction given to outstanding plants field-tested across the
country. The zinnia's height, 8 to 10 inches, was perfect for my
border, and so was its color. Despite the name Crystal White, it is
more creamy than brilliant white.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, serendipity popped up again, this time in a
nearby garden where I saw the silver-green foliage of California
poppies (Eschscholzia californica) emerging. I commented that the
typical orange and gold of the flowers were too vivid for me.
</P>
<P>
   The owner, a transplanted Englishwoman and fanatical gardener,
replied that she had got a seed packet of mixed colors and had
pulled out all but those that were a creamy white. These had seeded
true to their color over the years. Before my drooling became
excessive, she offered to ``weed out'' a handful for me.
</P>
<P>
   To add a dash of pink and a foliage contrast, I transplanted
several Mexican daisies (Erigeron karvinskianus). A perennial in
the Southern states, this plant behaves like a self-seeding annual
in my borders in central New Jersey. It has wiry foliage sprays,
somewhat like those of Moonbeam coreopsis, and profuse, tiny
daisylike flowers, which open white and turn to pink before neatly
disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   Though I frequently admired the color combinations and foliage
variation topping my wall, my laissez-faire approach to gardening
meant that I never pinched off seed heads, or deadheaded, so as to
encourage the annuals to keep producing flowers. As a result, the
ageratums and marigolds pretty much shut down production by
mid-September. The zinnias, California poppies and Mexican daisies
needed no special treatment and bloomed until knocked out by hard
frosts.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, from May through early November, I had a pastel flower
display in my sunny front garden. Neither pests nor diseases
attacked the plants. I watered, at most, weekly during dry spells
and never fertilized.
</P>
<P>
   And because I didn't deadhead, mulch or even clean the border in
the fall, I had an ample supply of seedlings when I cleared the
border in early May last year. The sight was a happy surprise, with
seedlings for all but the Crystal White zinnias.
</P>
<P>
   I thought it would be easy to buy more at a garden center, but
none were available. It seems that not enough were bought the
previous year. Thus, despite being honored by a premier national
organization as ``bred for gardeners who want to enjoy flowering
plants all season without labor intensive care,'' Crystal White is
not profitable for wholesale growers in my area.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for me, a group of seedlings emerged in late May. I
transplanted them to the ground abutting the top of the wall and
the base. Though they did not flower until July, they created a
smashing display into the first week of last year's warm December.
</P>
<P>
   My neighbors enjoy my colorful border as much as I do. One of
them commented, ``Your garden always looks so beautiful, yet I
never see you working in it.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's the kind of praise you like, these lovely self-seeding
annuals will help you earn it.
</P>
<P>
   While ageratum and marigold plants and seeds are widely
available, the others are not. Should you obtain seed, sow
immediately, because it can take up to three months for blossoms to
appear.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal White is available from Park Seed, 1 Parkton Ave.,
Greenwood, S.C. 29647; (800) 845-3369; free catalog.
</P>
<P>
   A creamy white California poppy is offered by Gardenmakers, P.O.
Box 65, Rowley, Mass. 01969; (978) 948-8481; free catalog.

<P>
   Mexican daisy is available from Thompson &AMP; Morgan, P.O. Box

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Excuse me, but did anyone notice how beautiful the
men are in there?'' Camille Peri asked a group of writers standing
in front of the W Hotel in midtown Manhattan last Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Moses, an earthy-looking woman with the long flowing hair
of a teen-ager, said, ``They don't make them like that in San
Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Peri and Ms. Moses are the editors of ``Mothers Who Think,''
a collection of essays (Villard Books, 1999) that first appeared in
the Web-based magazine Salon, which comes out of San Francisco. The
``Mothers Who Think'' feature has developed an avid following for
its insightful coverage of provocative subjects, from abortion to
raising a son without a father. But when the literary mothers
gathered to celebrate the book's publication, the conversation was
about men, sex and Bill Nye, the the science guy.
</P>
<P>
   When the party moved from the W Hotel to dinner for 10 at the
Gotham Bar and Grill, like mothers, they passed around pictures of
their children. Like high schoolers, they passed around their books
to be autographed. When the main course came, the talk was all
about Nye, host of a PBS children's show.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the only man around in the middle of the day, and you
can't help but make him the object of your affection,'' Ms. Moses
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you find him sexy?'' said Elizabeth Rapoport, the
executive editor of Times Books-Random House, who contributed the
essay ``How Many Working Fathers Does It Take to Screw In a Light
Bulb?'' She said, ``His Adam's apple is bigger than his thighs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moses said: ``He's the nerd you turned down in high school
when you shouldn't have. He could have fixed your bicycle. You
watch him because he's  &UR; the &LR;  man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has no zoft,'' countered Ms. Rapoport, who prefers Brendan
Fraser, who played Tarzan. ``Just when you think you have no sexual
feelings at all, there he is, in his loincloth.''
</P>
<P>
   They did touch on serious subjects, like the friction between
nannies and mothers, and whether pregnant women should drink. But
the subject always gravitated back to sex and having babies. As the
evening progressed, the talk grew more graphic. By dessert, they
all talked at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are all the sex stories in the book fantasy?'' Rahna Reiko
Rizzuto asked.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Peri, who claims the sexiest thing her husband could do is
clean the house, said, ``I've always wanted to do a story called
`Housekeeping Is Foreplay.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jayne Anne Phillips, the novelist, added, ``Sleep is very
sexual.''
</P>
<P>
   Lori Leibovich, an associate editor at Talk magazine, asked,
``Did you read about the foreplay pill?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moses said: `` It burns fat.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their frustrations, the mothers agreed they had no
regrets. Over espresso, Ms. Rapoport said: ``My husband and I
marvel that we had a life before the kids. What did we use to do?
We'd go to Zabar's and buy an interesting cheese. Then we'd go home
and eat it.''

MEDICAL BOARD REVIEWS PROBLEM WITH COSMETIC SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELIZABETH FERNANDEZ  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ A special committee of the Medical Board of
California, which has been exploring problems in the field of
cosmetic surgery, has launched a study on how hospital privileges
are issued to doctors.
</P>
<P>
   With more and more medical procedures performed in outpatient
clinics instead of hospitals, consumers increasingly rely on a gold
standard _ hospital privileges _ to help ensure the competency of
their doctors.
</P>
<P>
   But privileges _ a doctor's ability to perform certain
procedures at a hospital _ sometimes are granted on a seemingly
arbitrary basis with no uniform measure of skill or training,
numerous physicians says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we know what hospital privileges mean,'' said
Dr. Robert del Junco, a consultant to the Committee on
Plastic-Cosmetic Surgery. ``Some institutions grant you
unrestricted privileges to do whatever you want to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be guided by our primary responsibility, which is
the welfare and best interests of the patient.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is regarded as a medical hot button, particularly
among dermatologists who are sometimes denied privileges or simply
don't apply for them ``because a lot of what they do doesn't
require privileges,'' said Janie Cordray, a program support manager
with the Medical Board.
</P>
<P>
   California hospitals currently have no ``uniform or standard,
consistent, objective minimum criteria,'' Cordray said in a report
to the committee. For individual hospitals, guidelines to assess
the qualifications of a surgeon can be ``somewhat vague,
subjective, and open to interpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   Prompted by dozens of deaths over the last two years of patients
who underwent liposuction, a slate of legislation has been
introduced since January designed to provide stronger consumer
protection. The pending bills range from tightening advertising
restrictions to requiring malpractice insurance for outpatient
surgery. About 60 percent of all surgery now takes place in
outpatient settings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of this new legislation points to hospital privileges but
the question is what does it mean to have privileges?'' del Junco
said. ``If tomorrow they implemented a law saying you have to have
privileges, some institutions will grant them based on whatever
criteria they want.''
</P>
<P>
   During a cosmetic surgery board meeting on Thursday, the members
wrestled with a bill introduced by state Sen. Jackie Speier,
D-Hillsborough, to limit the amount of fat that can be suctioned
during liposuction.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, in the wake of lethal outcomes triggered by so-called
``large volume'' liposuction, the committee instituted a
moratorium, restricting surgical aspirate to 5,000 cubic
centimeters. Speier's bill would turn that moratorium into law.
</P>
<P>
   But some committee members voiced concern, saying doctors might
not have the latitude they need to make medical judgments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a problem putting a specific number into statute,''
said Dr. Thomas Joas, an anesthesiologist who heads the committee.
``I would hope this isn't a knee-jerk reaction to unfortunate
lethal complications.''

RUNNING AMOK ON EBAY WHILE SITTING STILL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 9) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J., Fla.)   (af)  
 By FRANK DE CARO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Among my friends, Ebay is hotter than Britney Spears.
</P>
<P>
   On-line bidding on everything from lady-head planters to Batman
bubble bath bottles has become a daily ritual for us at home, at
work, even at the gym.
</P>
<P>
   One pal, who doesn't own a personal computer but does have the
East Village's largest collection of poodle bric-a-brac, bids on
ceramic pooches and velvet dog paintings while sweating on the
treadmill. His health club has a Web TV setup in its cardiovascular
workout area.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wallet are thinner than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Internet shopping for canine kitsch has not entirely replaced
his flea market habit, or mine. But the convenience of virtual
browsing on Ebay _ the online auction service that is a national
swap meet for 6.5 million users _ has become a shared obsession for
our little clique.
</P>
<P>
   Why traipse to 26th Street at the crack of 9 every Sunday
morning when you can hunt for junk in your pajamas any night of the
week and still sleep in?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the pickings are better in cyberspace than in the
flower district.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six months, I have successfully bid on four
superhero drinking glasses from Pizza Hut from 1976, a footed tiki
bowl from a defunct Polynesian restaurant in Las Vegas, a vase
shaped like Barbie, a set of 90 ``Munsters'' trading cards, six
Archie comics jelly glasses with Sabrina's head embossed on the
bottom, a glossy of Gypsy Rose Lee on ``The Mike Douglas Show'' and
a copy of Phyllis Diller's last book (which at $11.50, including
shipping, seemed like a real steal).
</P>
<P>
   It would have taken years to find such a diverse haul in person.
</P>
<P>
   Every time an Ebay-brokered shipment arrives in a recycled
Kool-Aid carton or one of post office issue, I open it with the
enthusiasm of a 6-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   My domestic accomplice, a clutter-hating proponent of financial
responsibility, says: ``Save the box. We're going to have to live
in it someday.''
</P>
<P>
   But I can't stop, even if I may soon need a warehouse. No
pastime gives me greater pleasure than giving a good home to a
Supergirl glass that was sitting in someone's basement in
Kissimmee, Fla. for the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Ebay is not limited to the ephemera my friends and I
treasure. You can bid on vintage clothes, art, even real estate.
But Ebay's true flavor comes from offerings more kitschy than
vintage Chanel _ a rare pickle jar that sold for $44,000 in March
is more quintessentially Ebay than a cashmere sweater that went for
$220.
</P>
<P>
   The online auction house may not specialize in ``junque,'' but
it does sell a lot of it. Recent statistics estimate that Ebay
users exchanged more than $500 million of merchandise last year and
that fully one in 20 packages sent between private individuals via
the post office is a purchase made on Ebay. That's a lot of
tchotchkes changing hands.
</P>
<P>
   Even those of us whose idea of heaven is spending 10 hours
trudging through 1,600 booths at an Atlantic City collectibles show
are sometimes surprised by the things people collect.
</P>
<P>
   USA Weekend, a Sunday magazine insert to many newspapers,
reported recently that Glenn Wright, a building contractor from
Bothell, Wash., will make seven figures on Ebay this year selling a
stash of antique fruit crate labels that he and a partner amassed.
They called him the ``fruit label millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a 13-year-old boy from Haddonfield, N.J., spent like
one. He bid away $3.2 million of his parents' money on such objects
as a $1.2 million medical center in Jacksonville, Fla.; a van Gogh
sketch, a 1971 Corvette convertible and a $400,000 bedroom suite
that belonged to Canada's first Prime Minister, Sir John A.
Macdonald.
</P>
<P>
   There were no poodle plates on his list, but my friends could
relate. We've all overspent in a heated moment, bidding more than
we should in the final minutes of an auction for lilac Fiestaware
or a mint, box-fresh Hall China gold-dot casserole. Unlike our
spending sprees, however, the New Jersey boy's bids were suspended.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not rolling in bucks,'' his mother told The Newark
Star-Ledger last month. ``I don't know if he decided it was a
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that's exactly what Ebay is. Navigating through the
now-familiar Web site is like poking through the stalls of any flea
market in search of that one item that will complete a collection
or start a new one. My new Holy Grail is a set of ``Hollywood
Squares'' collectors plates from the 1970s. A friend has one, but I
want them all.
</P>
<P>
   I check in every day to see if someone is selling Rose Marie.
</P>
<P>
   As auctions progress, it's exciting to see how much people are
willing to spend for such articles _ not to mention how they'll
splurge on the type of toys their mothers gave away when they left
for college in 1974 _ and to note which postings go ignored.
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting, too, to see which brand-new items become
instant collectibles. Beanbags shaped like characters from the '60s
Christmas special ``Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,'' for instance,
which were sold at CVS stores last December to nostalgic baby
boomers for about $5 each, are already commanding much higher
prices. There is comfort in knowing that someone else is willing to
pay 20 bucks for a stuffed Abominable Snowman.
</P>
<P>
   At a cocktail party I attended two weeks ago, a young
computer-savvy man told me that in the last month he'd earned
enough money selling on Ebay to buy a DVD player. His take was
hundreds, not the millions of the fruit-label guy, but it was a
start.
</P>
<P>
   He sold the T-shirts, snow globes and photographs that press
agents had sent him over the years to promote new movies or
television shows, things that had filled his cubicle at work and
would most likely have ended up in the trash should he ever change
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will buy anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Having just spent $10 on a copy of the Totie Fields
mashed-potato-diet book, who was I to argue?

ONE BOY'S LAMENT: `I SHOULD HAVE HELD ON TIGHTER'

<P>
   BRIDGE CREEK, Okla. _ When the wind stopped, Jordan Wiese's mom
was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have held on tighter,'' the 6-year-old later told his
grandma.
</P>
<P>
   A kindergartner's grip is nothing against the fury of an
Oklahoma tornado. Still, Jordan Wiese wouldn't give up on the woman
who had planted roses in the back yard and served as ``bench mom''
at his T-ball games.
</P>
<P>
   When a neighbor pulled him from a creek bank across the road
from his trailer home with three broken ribs, a swollen leg and a
bruised back, Jordan limped in the direction of his yard. He found
a dead horse where his home had been.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday night, Jordan had been released from the hospital.
When he woke up at grandma's house the next morning, he told her,
``We have to go find my mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Bridge Creek, a rural area southwest of Oklahoma City where most
residences were trailer houses, had been converted into a Mars-like
red clay desert.
</P>
<P>
   Every home was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Metal sheeting that once formed walls was now wrapped like tin
foil around trees stripped bare along the tornado's path.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan and his grandma joined other relatives in the search.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this little boy picking through stuff,'' said Oklahoma
Army National Guard Capt. Barry Guidry. ``I asked him, `What are
you doing?' and he said, ``I'm looking for my mom. You wanna help
me?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Guidry moved his search team closer to reassure his new friend
they were trying their best. He carried Jordan on his shoulders so
he could see farther. He gave him his camouflage captain's hat and
another guardsman offered him a canteen of water. And the soldiers
awarded the boy a combat patch when he told them this story:
</P>
<P>
   With Monday's devastating storms roaring toward them, Kara
Wiese, 26, had wrapped her son in a heavy coat and called her
mother in nearby El Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was telling her to get out of the house and they were
going,'' Mary Wiese said.
</P>
<P>
   The tornado beat them to the door. Kara pushed Jordan into the
bathroom instead, just before the house rocked - ``like a
teeter-totter,'' Jordan said _ spun around and split in two. The
tornado sucked them out, son and mother, holding hands.
</P>
<P>
   And Jordan felt her slip away.
</P>
<P>
   All day Wednesday, Jordan looked for his mom. He found her car,
but she wasn't in it.
</P>
<P>
   He found some photographs, and two pages out of his baby book.
He found his baseball bat, glove and ball, mother's cedar hope
chest and a box of his matchbox cars.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the shift, the guardsmen lined up and saluted him,
since he was wearing the captain's cap. He dismissed them just
before sundown.
</P>

   Thursday morning, as Guidry and his men resumed the search at
Bridge Creek, the coroner in Oklahoma City was comparing a victim's
fingerprints to a set of Kara's. Mary Wiese had kept the prints in
a drawer at home since her daughter was a schoolgirl _ just in case
she ever was missing.

<P>
   When the medical examiner called to tell Kara Wiese's family
that the prints matched, they huddled around Jordan on the couch to
break the news.

THE MUMMY WRAP-UP: TOMB RAIDERS OF OLD FACED A FRIGHTFULLY CORNY
FATE

   It's fun to imagine what Karl Freund would think watching
Universal Pictures' remake of his 1932 directorial debut, ``The
Mummy.'' Walking mummified skeletons, flesh-eating scarab beetles
and computer-animated sandstorms in the shape of a gaping-mouthed
face would probably have sent Freund into cardiac arrest.
</P>
<P>
   But for special effects-savvy audiences, the new ``Mummy'' is
really just a sandy hors d'oeuvre before George Lucas serves up his
effects-laden main course, ``The Phantom Menace'' Star Wars prequel
on May 19.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't afford much time for Universal's big-budget monster
movie to capture an audience, but thanks to a number of visually
stunning coming- attraction trailers, ``The Mummy'' is almost
critic-proof.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Fraser leads a band of treasure-seeking explorers to the
fabled Egyptian City of the Dead, Hamunaptra, the burial place of
the Pharaohs and all their riches. It's also the final resting
place of Imhotep, an ancient evil high priest who was cursed to be
undead forever and is just waiting for someone to let him out.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a startling number of computer-generated images from _
coincidentally enough _ Lucas' Industrial Light &AMP; Magic, you almost
feel like you're watching DreamWorks' animated ``The Prince of
Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   But this $60 million ``Mummy'' still embraces the melodramatic,
over-acted, shoestring-budgeted origins of the original mummy
movies. Here's a peek inside the tomb of some of our favorite
mummified memories:
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mummy'' (1932) Though Freund's debut picture was hardly
the first appearance of a movie mummy (they actually date as far
back as 1901's ``The Haunted Curiosity Shop''), his vision of
Egypt's ancient dead became the icon to which future versions were
compared. Boris Karloff is the regenerated 3,700-year-old priest
Imhotep who eventually sheds his bandages and becomes the
menacingly pale Ardeth Bey. Zita Johann is the stalkee, believed to
be the reincarnation of Bey's former lover.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mummy's Hand'' (1940) Not really a sequel to Freund's
film, even though it uses almost 10 minutes of the picture as
flashback footage. This time, the vengeful undead priest is called
Kharis (Tom Tyler). (He also stalks the next three sequels.) The
new ``Mummy'' also borrows from this story of an ancient
brotherhood protecting the tomb of Princess Ananka from scavengers.
George Zucco is the high priest, with Dick Foran and Wallace Ford
doing a kind of Abbott and Costello routine as leaders of the
expedition and Peggy Moran as the mummy's love interest.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mummy's Tomb'' (1942) Kharis (Lon Chaney Jr., who plays
him in both subsequent sequels) and a new high priest schlep all
the way to the States to exact revenge on the aging Foran and Ford
(and their families). Elyse Knox is the mummy's gal, and there are
many cowering ninnies unable to escape the slow-moving, shambling
creature. You'd think that with one arm bandaged to its chest and
one leg dragging, this thing would be pretty easy to outmaneuver.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mummy's Ghost'' (1944) Kharis really starts to wear out
his welcome in this one. John Carradine joins the cast as the
mummy's mentor, out to find the reincarnation of Princess Ananka,
played by Ramsay Ames. The two eventually end up lost in the swamp,
and not a moment too soon.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mummy's Curse'' (1944) The end of the Kharis series (for
Universal at least) has both mummies unearthed from the swamp by
construction crews. There's so much flashback footage from previous
``Mummy'' movies, this hardly even counts as a new effort. But it's
fun to note that this Ananka, Virginia Christine, went on to play
Mrs. Olsen in the Folgers coffee commercials.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy'' (1955) As with most of
the Bud and Lou monster comedies, this spelled the end for
Universal's mummy outings. The monsters tended to lose their shock
value after being played up for punch lines, especially when they
looked as crummy as Eddie Parker as ``Klaris.'' Not surprisingly,
the last of the meet-the-monsters movies and the next-to-the-last
movie for the comedy duo.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mummy'' (1959) England's Hammer Studios revived the mummy
legend with this remake, starring Christopher Lee as the cursed
Kharis. Peter Cushing desecrates the tomb of Princess Ananka
invoking the mummy's wrath. Yvonne Furneaux is believed to be the
princess's reincarnation. Several of the more stylish elements of
this version also wound up in the new movie.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb'' (1964) The mummy is Ra-Antef
(Dickie Owen) this time, an attraction brought to Victorian England
only to go on an obligatory killing spree. Jeanne Roland is carried
through the sewers until the monster is stopped by the
reincarnation of its brother. This by-the-numbers follow-up was not
a sequel to the Lee version.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mummy's Shroud'' (1967) Edie Powell is Prem, the undead
reincarnation of an Egyptian slave in the lousiest of the unrelated
Hammer mummy outings. Peter Cushing narrates.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``Blood From the Mummy's Tomb'' (1972) Valerie Leon is possessed
by the soul of Queen Tara after she and fellow archaeologists
desecrate the queen's tomb. Murders ensue. Pretty good effort based
on Bram Stoker's ``Jewel of the Seven Stars'' and remade in 1980 as
``The Awakening,'' with Charleton Heston and Jill Townsend as his
possessed daughter.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, if you can't find these bandaged bad boys at your
local video store, the Sci-Fi cable channel will air a whole crypt
full of mummy movies at 2 p.m. every day next week, including: the
'59 ``Mummy'' on Monday, the '32 version on Thursday, ``Tomb'' on
Wednesday, ``Ghost'' on Thursday and ``Curse'' on Friday.

 &HT;    EEOC PASSED ON COMPLAINT THAT LED TO SUIT AGAINST COCA-COLA
 &HT;    With COKE. For release Sunday, May 9.
 &HT;    By DAVID McNAUGHTON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
investigated a discrimination complaint by Gregory Allen Clark
against Coca-Cola, and found that the available information did not
support the charge.
</P>
<P>
   Clark was the original plaintiff in a racial discrimination suit
filed against Coca-Cola in December and amended April 22. The
amended suit includes three other plaintiffs and asks for class
action status. In the suit, Clark charges he was denied promotions
on the basis of race.
</P>
<P>
   The EEOC is an independent agency that enforces federal laws
forbidding employment discrimination. Its decision on the Clark
complaint came in what's known as a ``dismissal and notice of
rights'' letter, which has a checklist of possible reasons the file
is being closed.
</P>
<P>
   James E. Voyles, a Marietta, Ga., lawyer representing the
plaintiffs, confirmed this reason was cited: ``Based upon its
investigation, the EEOC is unable to conclude that the information
obtained establishes violations of the statutes. This does not
certify that the respondent is in compliance with the statutes. No
finding is made as to any other issues that might be construed as
having been raised by this charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the details of the EEOC complaint nor the extent of the
investigation is public information.
</P>
<P>
   The EEOC finding ``has no application to the merits of the case
we subsequently filed,'' Voyles said Friday. ``Basically, it's a
non-determination letter. Neither have they found discrimination,
nor have they not found discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola declined comment on the EEOC finding.
</P>
<P>
   Clark did not have an attorney when he filed his EEOC complaint,
Voyles said.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the EEOC finding is uncertain, but less than what
it might have been if a lawyer had represented Clark at the time,
said New York attorney Arnold H. Pedowitz.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals without attorneys can get ``short shrift'' on such
complaints, said Pedowitz, who specializes in employment law. That
happens, he said, because ``most people are not good lawyers.''

 By RUTH LA FERLA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In ``Silk,'' Alessandro Baricco's cult novel of
erotic enthrallment, a French silk trader travels to remotest Japan
in 1861, where he meets a ravishing young courtesan. Her face is
turned away, her body enfolded in layers of brocade. He catches
only a glimpse of her hand peeking from her sleeve, but it is
enough to spark an obsession that haunts him for years.
</P>
<P>
   The spirit embodied by Baricco's temptress in his 1997 fable
(Random House, 1998), first published in Italy _ a spirit of
elusiveness, seduction, restraint _ has lately infused the world of
style, flourishing in high fashion, music videos, movie costumes,
even soap design. A flurry of obi-wrapped waistlines, bell sleeves,
thong sandals and trailing kimonos _ the hallmarks of Geisha Glam _
lends a provocative edge to the newest collections of Dolce &AMP;
Gabbana and Jean Paul Gaultier. They also furnish Madonna, still
pop's ranking culture chameleon, with her latest incarnation. They
turn up in the costumes for the new ``Star Wars'' installment
zooming into theaters next week.
</P>
<P>
   An infatuation with the stylized, circumscribed Japan of tea
houses, parasols and painted fans represents a pendulum swing away
from the slick esthetic and overt sexuality of just a minute ago,
as popularized by designers like Donatella Versace and Tom Ford of
Gucci. Geisha chic may express a yearning for a post-Monica return
to mystery and sexual reticence. It is Sayuri, the heroine of the
best-selling ``Memoirs of a Geisha'' by Arthur Golden (Alfred A.
Knopf, 1997), not Monica Lewinsky, who is fashion's latest muse;
the kimono, not the thong, is the year's most erotic garment.
</P>
<P>
   Schooled to keep her opinions as cloaked as her erogenous zones,
Sayuri symbolizes ``our thirst for mystery and hiddenness,'' said
Irene Wilson, the vice president of trend forecasting and consumer
behavior for Spiegel, the catalog company. The geisha's masklike
white makeup and concealing robes represent ``the beauty of the
unknown and unknowable,'' said Ms. Wilson, who created Elements, a
Spiegel Asian-influenced home and apparel catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Tricia Biggar, the movie costume designer who outfitted Natalie
Portman as the monarch Amidala in ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The
Phantom Menace,'' wrapped her in extravagant robes that owe a debt
to Japanese noblewomen's traditional garments. Ms. Portman's
stiffly formal get-ups and Noh-like whiteface function as a screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``In them you maintain a distance and a certain courtesy,'' Ms.
Biggar said. ``In a way, white makeup is like sunglasses. It allows
you to hide, perhaps to say one thing and mean another.''
</P>
<P>
   Helen Fisher, an anthropologist at Rutgers University who has
studied courtship behavior, views the fascination with the geisha
as a sign that ``we are finally beginning to appreciate the nature
of female sensuality, which is essentially hidden.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The geisha culture is all about creating a context for that
sensuality through flirting, touching, kissing, satin sheets and
scented flowers,'' she said. The obi-tied kimono functions
metaphorically as the cover for a vibrant sexuality that is best
kept under wraps, Ms. Fisher maintained.
</P>
<P>
   In a book coming out this month, ``The First Sex: The Natural
Talents of Women and How They Are Changing the World'' (Random
House), she examines the increasing number of women pouring into
the job market worldwide and argues that it's just smart to
cultivate geisha-like reticence, ``Women have nothing to gain by
airing their secrets or slinking into the office in a turquoise
pants suit,'' Ms. Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   That wisdom _ if not the exact fashion references _ is shared by
John Galliano, whose past collections have shimmered with allusions
to the high-bred Japanese courtesan. More recently, the glamour
that resides in the geisha's mystery and illusion has appealed to
Gaultier in Paris and to Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana in
Milan. These three, who were once fashion's foremost exponents of
sexual availability _ purveyors of cone bras and corsets worn as
evening wear _ have been among the strongest champions of Geisha
Glam.
</P>
<P>
   In his spring collection now in stores, Gaultier offers
kaleidoscopically patterned robes cinched obi-style at the waist
and cut to reveal the nape and upper back _ the No. 1 erogenous
zone in traditional Japan, but a new one in the West. The models in
Gaultier's Paris runway show last fall minced down the catwalk on
okobo, the geisha's high, thonged sandals, trailing sleeves so
capacious you could stuff a week's laundry inside.
</P>
<P>
   Dolce &AMP; Gabbana, too, resurrected the obi, a hit of their
previous collection, updating it for spring 1999 as a
torso-encasing surgical bandage. Their friend and muse, Madonna,
was swift to pounce on the geisha theme, adopting the designers'
hip-to-breastbone binding as her latest style insignia. The
ethereal girl wore her a red vinyl waist-cincher stretched tight
over a scarlet kimono at the Grammy Awards in February, and she
shows that costume in her new ``Nothing Really Matters'' video. Her
performance, she has said, is inspired by another character in
``Memoirs of a Geisha'' _ Hatsumomo, a schemer whose enigmatic
smiles conceal a buried sensuality.
</P>
<P>
   The same smoldering eroticism glows in the opaque visage of the
model of the moment, Devon Aoki, the face of Chanel. Karl
Lagerfeld, Chanel's designer, cast Ms. Aoki, whose background is
Japanese, German and British, to star in advertisements he
photographed himself. ``She has the modern geisha attitude,'' he
said when asked about his inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Lagerfeld seems increasingly captivated by the kind of delicacy
that until now seemed as dated as the peignoir. So does the
designer Vera Wang, whose Madison Avenue window this month features
three wispy outfits patterned with gray-brown misty peaks she found
in a traditional Japanese landscape painting. Ms. Wang so admired
this look, which she discovered in a painting at her doctor's
office, that she had it copied by Ratti, a premier Italian textile
house.
</P>
<P>
   There is a classical Japanese sensibility in the designs of
Akira Isogawa, sold at Barneys New York. Isogawa, a Japanese-born
Australian, makes regular trips to Kyoto in search of vintage
kimonos that inspire his beaded dresses and obis, the latter a
recent sellout at Barneys.
</P>
<P>
   Demure as they are, these looks can be provocative, said Julie
Gilhart, the vice president of fashion merchandising at Barneys.
``They are fluid and structured at the same time,'' she pointed
out, much like the geisha's architected coif. ``You imagine that
once you take out those sticks holding it in place, all that hair
comes cascading down.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   To many, Geisha Glam may seem to have arrived only minutes ago.
But in some quarters it has reached the bandwagon stage. Lafco, a
soap maker based in TriBeCa, has introduced a line of $15 soaps it
calls Kimono, and wraps them in paper with old-fashioned Japanese
designs and ties them with satin cords. The company's news release,
boasting of ``sensitivity to society's shifting trends'' cites as
influences Madonna's new look, ``Memoirs of a Geisha,'' feng shui
in home decor and the new ``Star Wars'' costumes. The company is
``doing the Asian thing,'' Jon Bresler, one of the founders, says
in the publicity package.
</P>
<P>
   Some might interpret the geisha's pale face and constricting
costumes as signaling a return to a decorous femininity that went
out with Pat Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you wear a kimono you're suddenly forced into a ladylike
posture in the old-fashioned sense of that word,'' said Ms. Wilson
of Spiegel. ``You have to sit up, to stand very straight and take
very small steps. There's no way that you can slouch or sink into
an overstuffed sofa. It just doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   The geisha as style icon may also suggest that preening,
manipulative behavior by women in the war of the sexes, once
scorned by feminists, is becoming respectable again. ``The geisha
has taught us that a woman can use her wiles _ that's the ultimate
power she has,'' said Irma Zandl, president of the Zandl Group, a
trend and consulting company in New York. ``When we talk about a
geisha, we're talking about a tease.''
</P>
<P>
   But Liza Crihfield Dalby, an American anthropologist who lived
in Kyoto as a geisha in the 1970s and wrote a book, ``Geisha,''
which was reissued by the University of California Press last year
in response to what a press spokeswoman called ``geisha mania,''
said that sometimes a dress is just a dress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so easy to take the metaphor of clothing constriction as
symbolizing social constriction,'' said Ms. Dalby, also the author
of ``Kimono'' (Yale University Press, 1994), a look at Japanese
society and culture through clothing. ``I don't buy that. It's a
fashion game, something new and different for this season.''
</P>
<P>
   In the West, ``we've totally mythologized the geisha,'' she
continued. ``She's someone who can satisfy all your desires. She's
very mysterious under all that white makeup. And also, because
she's foreign and, if you don't speak Japanese, sort of mute, she's
an ideal screen for projecting fantasies.''
</P>
<P>
   What more has fashion ever asked?

 By BENJAMIN CHEEVER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The waiters wore white Brooks Brothers shirts, opened
at the throat and with the sleeves rolled up to show off massive
biceps. There were strobe lights; the music was loud. Set
tastefully around the store were squares of plastic turf with rep
ties rearing out of them like toothless serpents. ``This is Brooks
Brothers for the millennium,'' said Joseph Gromek, the store's
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Cumming, Matthew Broderick and Marisa Tomei had invited me
(or at least signed the invitation) to celebrate the opening of a
new, hip branch of the retailer that sold suits to Abraham Lincoln,
at 666 Fifth Ave., on Monday night. The line to get in went up
Fifth Avenue to 53d Street, and then out almost to the Avenue of
the Americas. Inside, there were smoke machines, people who hadn't
shaved. A drag performer called Lady Bunny introduced the club
singer Ultra Nate.
</P>
<P>
   I had meant to fit in. I wore my pink button-down Brooks shirt.
I didn't have a Brooks tie, so I wore one with Labrador retrievers
on it. My chinos were Brooks (W32 L30), no pleats, and cinched at
the waist with a sharkskin belt, which I had purchased when a
cruise ship I was on docked at Cozumel. You see the problem.
</P>
<P>
   I was introduced to Broderick. He was there for Naked Angels,
the downtown theater group with Hollywood connections, whose stars
were lending their names to the occasion. (Brooks made a
contribution in return for their presence and support.) He said he
was pleased to meet me. I said I was pleased to meet him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I've been helpful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' I said, ``very helpful,'' and then he left.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what he could have done. I never did fit in at
Brooks. For years, I wasn't square enough. During the late 1950s
and early '60s, when the Madison Avenue store was a high temple of
respectability and taste, my father used to drag me there. I lugged
three Brooks suits off to Loomis, a boarding school for boys in
Connecticut, and wore them to chapel and to mixers. I don't know
what God thought, but the Chaffee girls from our sister school were
easily able to keep their passions in check. Who knew what was
going on inside that sack of flannel? You might have emptied a
revolver, hit the suit six times and left me unscathed. I couldn't
imagine clothes that fit less well.
</P>
<P>
   Then I joined the wrestling team and developed an 18-inch neck.
When my father brought me in to buy shirts that year, it turned out
that the only ones they had with necks that large were large all
over. They were so large that modesty did not require the purchase
of any other article of clothing. A shirt that fastened at the
throat trailed its arms and tails on the floor. Did they have any
shirts that might better approximate the shape of my body? They did
not, we were told. This was the Brooks shirt. We could buy it, or
not. ``All right,'' my father said. ``We'll have six in white and
as many in blue.''
</P>
<P>
   I was simply the wrong shape. I slouched and mumbled, ate with
my mouth open. I wasn't a Brooks man. Not yet, but perhaps one day
I would be. At least the clothes didn't reject me like a plastic
heart. My father had had a friend who bought a pair of shoes at the
Brooks on Madison and by the time he had walked to Grand Central
Terminal the shoes were filled with blood. This story was told and
retold gleefully, not as a criticism of Brooks, but as an attack on
the man who foolishly thought he could stuff his fat, nouveau feet
into the shoes of privilege and command.
</P>
<P>
   Jarlath Mellett is the design director for the new line of
Brooks clothes, which are appearing on the sides of buses all over
town _ elegant slate sweaters worn without shirts by members of a
family, if everyone in a family were handsome, thin and the same
age.
</P>
<P>
   Mellett is a cheerful, stylish man, who wore a suit jacket and
shirt buttoned at the throat with no necktie. I mean, you could see
his collar button. Brooks could be ``hip and fun and still 100
percent true to its roots,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 24,000-square-foot store is on two levels, sleek and airy.
The dark wood and glass cases of the original store on Madison
Avenue and 44th Street have been replaced with open displays.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked Gromek if he didn't think he had an image problem,
he didn't see it. ``Brooks is a phenomenal brand,'' he told me. The
pear-wood display cases came from Utah, he said, from the same
company that supplied wood for the Mormon Tabernacle.
</P>
<P>
   Then his friend Tom Florio, the publisher of GQ magazine,
appeared, and the two embraced. ``Two weeks and the boat's in the
water,'' Gromek told him.
</P>
<P>
   After this, I saw a striking young man in a dark suit, a black
shirt, black vest, black tie and black cowboy hat. I saw another in
leather pants and a red top. Nobody else seemed to be wearing a
shirt anything like mine. I felt like a hen in a fox house.
</P>
<P>
   The first floor of the store is connected to the second floor by
two side-by-side staircases, and at about 9:30 p.m., men with those
earplugs we know from the Secret Service closed off both
staircases. Then, the models came down one staircase, walked across
an improvised runway and went up the other.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the men were unshaven and had rumpled hair. The women
didn't seem to be wearing brassieres. When they hit the cameras,
they'd smile, briefly.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks had been stodgy and conservative when I was trying to get
in. Now, the organization seems to have whizzed around behind me,
and I'm the square and stodgy one. These models looked even less
respectable than I am. And that's going somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   At the Loomis School for boys, breakfast was the least formal
meal, but we were still required to wear a necktie and jacket. Many
of those jackets were from Brooks. Looking at the striking and
strikingly appareled young men and women coming down the stairs, I
couldn't help reflecting that not one of them would have been
admitted to breakfast at the Loomis School for boys.
</P>
<P>
   A charter member of the bridge-and-tunnel crowd, I left the
party at 10. I saw Marisa Tomei, but missed some of the other Naked
Angels, like Fisher Stevens and Rob Morrow. I did stay long enough
to see somebody smoke a cigarette. And I heard a woman say, ``Hi,
my name is Tiffany.''
</P>
<P>
   The next Brooks advertising campaign is being shot by the
high-fashion photographer Peter Lindbergh, who usually works for
clients like Italian Vogue and Bottega Veneta. He was in town the
other day, shooting fall clothes on a variety of New York
characters who represent the new Brooks man. They include Cliff
Williams, a hip downtown restaurateur; Vikram Chatwal, a hip
midtown hotelier, and Richard Johnson, the Page Six columnist for
The New York Post.

 &HT;    Lions and tigers and Mickey
 &HT;    By Ricardo Gandara
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You say Target just got in the cutest little girl's clothing
promoting the latest Disney movie? I'm there. The Little Mermaid is
skating on ice at the Erwin Center? Ka-ching, I've got seats.
</P>
<P>
   Let the adventurers have Mount Everest and the Grand Canyon. Our
family vacation every other year is to Disney World in Central
Florida. Our friends ask, ``Why?'' I reply, ``Three reasons:
Alexandra, Victoria and Isabella, ages 7, 5 and 2.'' Truth be told,
I love Disney World every bit as much as they do. I tear up every
time I watch them on the It's a Small World ride. I don't mind
riding Snow White's Scary Adventures five times in a row. I pose
with Mickey, again and again and again.
</P>
<P>
   And every time we return, there's something's new in this
30,500-acre entertainment and recreation resort. Haven't been there
lately? Let's catch up. There's been a flurry of growth since 1998
with at least a dozen new shows and attractions added; Disney is
expert at reinventing its theme parks to keep us coming back for
more. That's why it continues to be the nation's most popular
tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest new Disney World attraction is the new 500-acre
theme park, Animal Kingdom. We'll go there first.
</P>
<P>
   An African safari
</P>
<P>
   Boarding Kilimanjaro Safari's 32-passenger open all-terrain
truck, my kids' eyes were wide and their arms tight around me. We'd
told them they'd see real wild animals. They weren't prepared for a
family of baboons sunning on rocks just a few yards away, or a herd
of elephants splashing at a watering hole, or black rhinos in pools
and giraffes or zebras and antelope foraging for food. Disney has
spared no detail in re-creating the savannah and bush country of
Africa to simulate a real safari experience. Landscapers scoured
the world to bring in millions of plants, shrubs and trees. With
1.5 million cubic yards of soil, they built a rolling savannah.
</P>
<P>
   My middle child, Victoria, was quick to notice that the lions
weren't chasing the zebras. ``They ate them in 'The Lion King,' ''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   I had to come up with something clever. ``Oh, honey, they have
these secret whatchamacallits in the ground that won't allow the
lions to leave their area. That way, the zebras can say 'na, na,
na, na, na, na.' '' In reality, there are hidden moats to keep
animals from escaping.
</P>
<P>
   A couple from Flagstaff, Ariz., Dave and Amanda Collier, enjoyed
the bumpy 20-minute ride so much that they hurried off to get back
in line to ride again. ``There were so many animals. We tried to
look at everything but missed the black rhino,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Animal Kingdom opened last spring, and already waits for
attractions are just as long as at the other Disney theme parks.
While this theme park has fewer attraction than MGM Studios, to see
it all will take you a full day. The park is divided into several
sections: Africa, Asia, Safari Village, Camp Minnie-Mickey,
Dinoland and The Oasis.
</P>
<P>
   Don't pass up the Pangani Forest Exploration Trail at Africa,
where you're treated to a close-up look at a dozen lowland
gorillas.
</P>
<P>
   Dinoland U.S.A.'s main attraction is the Countdown to Extinction
thrill ride, where guests board vehicles that take them back 65
million years on a journey to save the last dinosaur from
extinction before the crash of an asteroid. Camp Minnie-Mickey
features the stage shows ``Festival of the Lion King'' and
``Pocahontas and Her Forest Friends.'' At Safari Village, see the
incredible 145-foot man-made ``Tree of Life'' that has plaster
carvings of more than 300 animals. At the base of the tree's
gnarled trunk, you can enjoy the 3-D film ``It's Tough to be a
Bug.'' Little kids may get frightened when they feel like bugs are
zooming right at them, sneezing wet stuff in their faces or
crawling under their bottoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``That tree has got to be the most interesting sculpture I've
ever seen,'' said Rick Savane of Grand Rapids, Mich., who's taken
his three children to Disney World twice in the past two years.
``We've got to go get our picture taken with the tree in the
background.''
</P>
<P>
   Asia, featuring the Kali River Rapids, a white-water raft
adventure and the Animal Kingdom's newest adventure, is dedicated
to the rainforests and wild animals of southern Asia. You're
launched on 12-person rafts into the Chakranadi River for a very
wet ride through the jungle habitat. The Maharajah Jungle Trek is a
walking journey where you see tigers and other animals native to
that region.
</P>
<P>
   Other new attractions abound throughout Disney World's three
other theme parks _ Epcot, Disney-MGM Studios and the Magic Kingdom
_ in what officials are calling the busiest growth period in the
resort's 27-year history.
</P>
<P>
   More is on the way. ``With the same level of energy and
enthusiasm that we'll celebrate the new millennium, Walt Disney
World Resort will actively pursue breakthrough ideas well into the
next century,'' said Duncan Wardle, Disney's director of public and
media relations.
</P>
<P>
   Added to the lineup:
</P>
<P>
   -- As if the Magic Kingdom's 40 adventures weren't enough, Buzz
Lightyear's Space Station Spin engages guests in an interactive
space fantasy in Tomorrowland. You join forces with Buzz Lightyear
to defend the Earth's supply of batteries from the Evil Emperor
Zurg. It replaced Take Flight, an aviation history attraction.
Coming to Fantasyland this summer, the little ones will enjoy ``The
Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh,'' a ride into the Hundred Acre
Wood to see Winnie, Pig, Eeyore, Tigger and Roo. It's replacing Mr.
Toad's Wild Ride.
</P>
<P>
   -- Remember ``The Enchanted Tiki Room'' in Adventureland in the
Magic Kingdom? It's under new management, the new landlords being
Iago from Disney's animated film ``Aladdin'' and Zazu from ``The
Lion King.'' The original cast of birds is still there, but new
songs make the show more upbeat and jazzy.
</P>
<P>
   -- On Test Track, the longest (one mile) and fastest (65 miles
per hour) ride ever at Disney, riders in test vehicles see how GM
vehicles are tested before they hit the market. You'll climb hills,
hang on during hairpin turns, bounce down bumpy roads and then whiz
on straight-aways. The Epcot ride isn't scary, just long and fast.
Also at Epcot is Innoventions, where more than 100,000 square feet
are devoted to tomorrow's breakthrough technology today _ a look at
the latest in computers and communications. You can take a virtual
tour of a Roman basilica and see it as it looked in the 14th
century.
</P>
<P>
   -- Disney-MGM Studios is more than a working film, TV, radio and
animation studio. The most talked about attraction is up in the sky
in a brilliant display of lights, lasers and colorful pyrotechnic
explosions at a new 6,500-seat amphitheater. The 25-minute
``Fantasmic'' nightly show features 50 performers, Disney
characters and dancing waters synchronized to melodies of Disney
classics. And, if your kids can't get enough of the dorky Doug from
ABC Saturday morning cartoon fame, take them to see ``Disney's Doug
Live.'' The musical stage show is performed several times a day and
invites members of the audience to participate.
</P>
<P>
   -- Winter Wonderland, a 36-hole miniature golf course next to
Blizzard Beach water park, opens this month. The story goes that
one Christmas Eve, Santa spotted snow while flying over Florida and
decided it'd be a good vacation spot for the elves. He called it
Winter Wonderland but noticed it lacked a golf course, which
motivated the elves to build a sand course and a snow course.
Guests are treated to wild antics while playing the greens.
</P>
<P>
   -- Downtown Disney's West Side is home to a state-of-the-art
1,671-seat theater built for Cirque du Soleil , the world-renowned
theater company from Quebec. The current production, ``La Nouba,''
is presented twice nightly except Monday and Tuesday. Reservations
can be made by calling (407) 939-7600.
</P>
<P>
   -- In October, Epcot will kick off a 15-month celebration of the
new millennium featuring new entertainment and exhibits of
cutting-edge technologies. ``The unique festivities will highlight
mankind's triumphs, challenges and opportunities,'' said Wardle.
Epcot will also introduce a new nighttime spectacle filled with
lasers, fireworks and special effects.

BUS WITH RELIEF SUPPLIES FOR CHIAPAS HELD AT BORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ Seven tons of supplies, including vitamins and
wheelchairs, are stacked in a school bus in the Rio Grande Valley
instead of being used in the highlands of Chiapas because the
Mexican government won't let the shipment enter the country.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Young, founder of the Wheelchair Project of Fresno,
Calif., said Thursday he would not be swayed from delivering the
supplies to the mountainous region of southeastern Mexico that has
been a point of contention between Zapatista rebels and the
government.
</P>
<P>
   The supplies are bound for places including Acteal, the village
where 45 peasants were massacred while praying in a church on Dec.
22, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may not like who I am giving the supplies to, but it is
immoral to stop me,'' said Young, 42, who has tried since April 13
to get the supplies into Mexico. ``You never give up when you are
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the supplies are 6,000 pounds of food, 500,000 vitamins,
150 shovels and thousands of syringes and pencils.
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatista rebels launched a brief uprising four years ago to
seek greater self rule in the largely impoverished region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not have a right to ignore the suffering of our fellow
human beings, our brothers and sisters,'' said Young, who is a high
school social studies teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Young said he has repeatedly been turned away by Mexican customs
officers at the international bridge which links Pharr, Texas, to
Reynosa, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican Embassy was familiar with the case and said Young
could not bring the supplies into Mexico unless he designates a
registered, non-profit organization to receive them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, Mr. Young has refused to comply with the law,''
said Jose Zabalgoitia, a spokesman for the embassy. Mexican border
officials said the supplies could not enter the country because
Chiapas was a ``sensitive area'' and the shipment included such
forbidden items as pencils and over-the-counter medications such as
aspirin, according to Young.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the items were purchased with Young's own money and he
said he has had to endure the additional expense of a hotel room as
he awaits permission to enter the country. The Wheelchair Project
is a relief organization that provides medical supplies and
equipment to Central America and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   After three break-ins, the school bus has been moved from the
motel parking lot to a fenced-in storage lot where Young said it
will stay until he can continue the journey _ his third to Chiapas
in 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Young) is a nice guy. I would hate to be in his shoes,''
said Danny Cuellar, who is the owner of Valley Volvo Truck Center
and donated a parking space for Young's bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is going through a lot to help people, and they are holding
him up for no reason,'' Cuellar said.

WARFARE FOR THE NEXT GENERATION: BIO-TERRORISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every week or so for the last 52 weeks, there has been an
anthrax bomb scare in the city of Los Angeles, California.
Fortunately, all of them have been false alarms. Someday, one of
them might not be.
</P>
<P>
   In Tokyo, ``someday'' happened four years ago. On March 20,
1995, the Aum Shinrikyo cult, which no intelligence agency in the
western world had ever heard of, launched a Sarin gas attack in the
Tokyo subway system. Twelve people were killed and more than 5,000
were injured. Had the cult's technology been more sophisticated,
the toll in human life would have been catastrophic.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the science behind bio-weaponry has advanced
dramatically. Genetic researchers now believe that within the next
decade technology will exist to create biological weapons that can
kill certain ethnic groups while leaving others unharmed.
Specifically, they believe it will be possible to develop
``targeted'' anthrax that kills ethnic Albanians, but not Serbs;
Jews but not Arabs; Greeks but not Turks.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of this kind of genetic warfare is terrifying.
The weaponry is tasteless, odorless and could be shipped into any
country at any time in component parts. What once might have been a
bad script for a James Bond movie is now an acute national security
and public health issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a time when bio-terrorism is a real concern,''one
senior Clinton Administration national security official told
Science magazine in its April 30 issue. That concern is causing
scientists and policy-makers around the world to finally speak out
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   On January 21, the British Medical Association released a report
called ``Biotechnology, Weapons and Humanity.'' The report warned
that genetic research could be perverted to develop ``weapons which
may become a major threat to existence of Homo sapiens.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Vivienne Nathanson, who heads up health policy for the BMA,
said of her organization's inquiry: ``We went into this being very
skeptical, with a position that `It can't be done.' But then after
examining what is going on we decided that it might be possible
after all. It would be a tragedy if in 10 years time the world
faces the reality of genetically engineered and possibly
genetically targeted weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Venter, co-founder of Celera Genomics Corporation and an
adviser to President Clinton on the threat of genetically
engineered weaponry, shares Dr. Nathanson's view. In a speech to
the American Association for the Advancement of Science in January,
Venter said that cracking the genetic code of every bacteria and
virus was no longer just a biomedical inquiry, but a national
security imperative as well. Genomics research, Venter argued, was
the only viable deterrent against attacks on the United States by
``extremists'' or rogue states armed with bio-weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, President Clinton signed a national security
memorandum calling for the preservation of variola (smallpox virus)
in top-security laboratories. He did so at the urging of Joshua
Lederberg, president emeritus of Rockefeller University. Faced with
the choice of eradicating smallpox forever or keeping it for
research purposes, Lederberg argued successfully that the threat of
bio-terrorism required the US to keep the pathogen on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Targeted bio-weaponry is not new. As the British journalist
Gwynne Dyer reported recently in the Sacramento Bee, ``The
apartheid regime did a lot of work on bacteria that would attack
only blacks? Iraq has a big germ warfare program.'' And there are
detailed US intelligence reports that show the former Soviet Union
made a major effort to ``weaponize'' the lethal smallpox virus. But
the old bio-weaponry is Cocoa Puffs compared to what will soon be
possible.
</P>
<P>
   The political and national security leadership of the US
government needs to present a detailed account of where we stand in
our preparations for the coming war against bio-terrorism.
President Clinton addressed this issue briefly in a speech at the
US Naval Academy a year ago, but he was not (purposely) specific.
The country now needs to know the specifics, so that we can make
informed judgements on how best to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   There are things that can be done. At the moment, the US
government is the major source of funds for $3 billion Human Genome
Project. The US might double the funding for this research and, if
need be, triple it. We need to know the exact cause of anthrax's
toxicity. We need to know the antidotes for other pathogens.
</P>
<P>
   Genomics is to the next era of warfare what nuclear fission was
to the post-World War II era. The Human Genome Project is the
Manhattan Project of our time. Speeding up its progress may save
thousands and perhaps hundreds of thousands of lives down the road.
Throwing money at it would be wise public policy.

PENTAGON SEEKS TOP COMMANDER TO RUN DISASTER RELIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, May 9)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon is seeking the appointment of a
military commander for the United States who would help civilian
agencies take charge of the government's response to domestic
disasters, sending troops, equipment and medical gear into a crisis
zone.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for a top emergency military commander stems from White
House fears that terrorists may strike U.S. cities, subways,
buildings and other population centers with chemical and biological
weapons sometime in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is awaiting final approval by Defense Secretary
William Cohen and President Clinton. Deputy Defense Secretary John
Hamre said that Cohen will formally review the plan in June, with
Clinton scheduled to act by the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military now has no pre-defined role for handling
domestic emergencies. National Guard units, which are available to
help when disaster strikes, are under the control of the nation's
governors.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon will be ready for its expanded role in domestic
disaster relief by October, according to Air Force Gen. Joseph
Ralston, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The disaster
commander's unit is to be called the Joint Task Force for Civil
Support.
</P>
<P>
   The details of the Pentagon's proposal are still being worked
out, but, according to Ralston, the officer who directs the Joint
Task Force would report to the military's Commander-in-Chief for
the Atlantic Command based in Norfolk, Va., who in turn reports to
the president.
</P>
<P>
   The Joint Task Force would not have a standing collection of
armed forces immediately under it. Instead, in time of crisis, it
would draw Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force personnel as
needed from the Atlantic Command. The military leader also would
have powers to dispatch uniformed medical and emergency personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency would continue to have
responsibility for coordinating disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the specialized help the Pentagon could supply include
troops trained in chemical and biological weapons clean-up and
cargo planes to airlift medical equipment to a crisis zone,
according to Ralston.
</P>
<P>
   Also available are specialized Marine Corps troops _ the
Chemical-Biological Incident Response Force _ which has ``an expert
and robust decontamination capability,'' Ralston said. The Pentagon
also is training 10 specialized teams of National Guardsmen to
combat chemical and biological weapons attacks and assist local
authorities in determining the scope of a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The impetus for an expanded military role stems from
administration concern about the potential for a terrorist strike
with chemical weapons such as sarin or biological weapons such as
anthrax.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton in January said a terrorist attack on American
soil using these types of weapons was ``highly likely'' in the next
few years.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary Cohen said ``one of the greatest threats that
we're going to face in the future would be chemical and biological
attacks, and likely to take place nearly simultaneously in multiple
places.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamre, explaining the Pentagon plan, said, ``Losing 200
Americans at Oklahoma City was a true tragedy. But if a terrorist
incident involves a chemical or a biological weapon, we're now
talking about consequences far larger. And we must begin to get
ready for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, who is pressing the military to take on the
expanded disaster relief role, said, ``I don't mean to be an
alarmist, but we have got to address this problem as if it could
happen tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon proposal has generated concern from critics who
charge that having U.S. troops policing U.S. citizens, even in time
of crisis, would threaten privacy rights and civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   The Posse Comitatus Act, passed after the Civil War, forbids
federal troops from arresting civilians or doing routine police
work or intelligence gathering within U.S. borders.
</P>
<P>
   In order to address these concerns, the Pentagon insists that
civilians would have control of any active duty troops sent to a
crisis zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have told the civil agencies, `We recognize your authority,
we are going to operate under your direction,''' Hamre said.
``We'll be absolutely under your oversight and control and
supervision and direction.'''
</P>
<P>
   That assurance doesn't impress the American Civil Liberties
Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country has had a tradition of separation between law
enforcement, which operates in the U.S., and the military, which
operates abroad,'' said Gregory Nojeim, legislative counsel on
national security for the ACLU, based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soldiers are trained to fight wars, not to enforce laws with
proper respect for civil liberties,'' he added. ``Mixing the
military with law enforcement is a recipe for disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE - OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The proposal stops short of creating what some Pentagon
officials had initially sought _ a new commander-in-chief, or CINC,
slot for civil defense, a four-star admiral or general who would
have a standing military force at his disposal.
</P>
<P>
   But Hamre still believes that there eventually may be a CINC
position created. ``Our view is that having a CINC is a possibility
in the future if this mechanism isn't sufficient. At this stage, I
think we feel this mechanism will be sufficient,'' he said.

   WASHINGTON _ At the headquarters of Al Gore's presidential
campaign, veterans pass on this advice to panicky new recruits: the
front-running candidates will go through 12 lifetimes between now
and the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   If that's true, Gore has only 11 lifetimes left.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's claim to the Democratic nomination was once
seen as inevitable. But with a series of small gaffes like claiming
to have invented the Internet, and by doggedly sticking to a few
narrow, poll-tested themes, he has let challenger Bill Bradley back
into the race, many believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may be,'' Gore campaign spokesman Roger Salazar laughed
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar could afford to laugh. The vice president's bumpy road
to the nomination has smoothed a bit, suggesting an end to Gore's
first ``season in hell,'' as such rough patches are known in
political circles.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, Gore's only opponent, enjoyed a ``boomlet'' of media
attention after an unexpectedly strong first quarter of fund
raising that brought him $4.3 million. The former New Jersey
senator also charmed many of the people he met in campaign stops,
sparking comparisons to Gore's caution and rigid style. Bradley
also presented himself as the candidate of big ideas, although he
has yet to articulate those ideas.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's lead in the polls is back up. One recent poll in New
Hampshire, the nation's first primary state, shows him leading
Bradley by 45 points. And after months of following the Clinton
1996 re-election model of small initiatives to keep a happy
electorate engaged, Gore too is reaching for boldness and bigness.
</P>
<P>
   The American people didn't want ``the vision thing,'' as former
President Bush used to call it, in the 1996 contest between
President Clinton and Bob Dole. The strong economy and peace abroad
had voters generally satisfied with the course of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But the conflict in Kosovo and the massacre of high school
students in Littleton, Colo., have left the electorate unsettled,
said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, who does not work for the
Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not going to elect their president in the 21st
century because of the size of airplane seats,'' she said.
``They're going to elect someone who has a major vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the first of the year, Gore has had the starring role in
announcing a number of limited administration initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   He announced new regulations aimed at clearing the haze in
national parks, new regulations requiring larger print for
nonprescription medicine and a proposal for a telephone line for
drivers to get up-to-the-minute road conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, he unveiled the administration's efforts to
standardize car seats for children and an initiative to give
airline travelers more opportunities to complain about service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to be half-hearted about (issues) only reinforces the
notion that Gore is half-hearted,'' said Carl Pope, president of
the Sierra Club. ``(Voters) don't have the sense that this is a
stand-up guy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days since the high school massacre, Gore has talked
about ``the lessons of Littleton'' and launched what aides describe
as a national ``call to action'' on an agenda that melds gun
control, curbs on media violence, better access to mental health,
values education, character formation and making communities ``more
liveable.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some of Gore's harshest critics have noticed the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Gore, a straight arrow in his private life, emphasizes
the role of right and wrong, good and evil, in Littleton, no one
snickers,'' Fred Barnes, executive editor of The Weekly Standard,
wrote in the conservative opinion magazine this week. ``Gore is
being dragged down in polls because of his association with an
immoral president. On Littleton, he's on the side of good,
Christianity and morality.''
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate political question, though, is whether Gore can
beat Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the front-runner for the
Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Gore trailed Bush by only a point, 48 percent to 47
percent, in a CNN/Gallup/USA Today poll. The latest poll shows Gore
far behind, 59 percent to 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the party majority that supports the vice president
seems to be as panic-free as his campaign veterans. There's no sign
that the prominent Democrats who decided not to challenge Gore for
the nomination are reconsidering.
</P>
<P>
   But unless Gore can turn his poll deficit against Bush into an
equally comfortable advantage, he may face another ``season in
hell.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The party elites want to see that gap closed,'' said Lake.
``They don't want to go through the election with white knuckles.''

LAWMAKER SAYS HOUSE VOTES HAVE PUSHED CLINTON TOWARD PEACE PACT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 9)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If a peace agreement is reached over Kosovo, Rep.
Tom Campbell, R-Calif., will claim a small part of the credit.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell says the peace drive intensified after he forced
Congress to take stands that amounted to a refusal to expand the
war.
</P>
<P>
   Despite President Clinton's repeated statements that he had no
plans to send ground forces to stop Yugoslavia's killing and
uprooting of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, Campbell says he thinks
the administration was in fact planning to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The maverick congressman insists that the plan started to change
after he forced the House _ against the wishes of his own
Republican leaders _ to vote April 28 to either declare war or pull
out the U.S. troops who are taking part in the NATO air campaign
over Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of ballots, House members voted against declaring
war, against pulling U.S. troops out of the region _ and against a
resolution authorizing the air campaign, which had begun March 24.
</P>
<P>
   While the votes were inconsistent and confusing, they at least
signaled that the lawmakers did not want to expand the war. Then
last Tuesday, the Senate voted to kill a resolution that would have
allowed Clinton ``to use all necessary force,'' including land
troops, in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it did a lot of good,'' Campbell said of the
congressional votes on Kosovo policy. He also credits the Rev.
Jesse Jackson and the Russians with adding to the pressure to end
the conflict quickly over the rebellious Kosovo province in Serbia,
the dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   To secure the votes against the wishes of the Republican
leaders, Campbell invoked a provision of the 1973 War Powers Act
that allows any lawmaker to demand such votes.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman, who teaches law at Stanford University,
insisted that the Constitution gives Congress the sole power to
declare war even though it also makes the president
commander-in-chief. Campbell interprets those provisions to mean
that if Congress declares war, it is then up to the president to
conduct that war.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Campbell admitted that most lawmakers
didn't want to take a position on the war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a lot easier politically'' not to take a position, he
said. Lawmakers can say that if the war succeeded, they backed the
president, but if it didn't, they can say they saw defeat coming,
he explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom is a man who thinks things through,'' House Majority
Leader Richard Armey, R-Texas, said before the House votes. ``He is
very bright, and he is a man of what seems oftentimes to be
unbending resolve once he sets himself on a course.''
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-term congressman from San Jose is used to bucking the
leadership. In 1997 he was one of nine Republicans who refused to
vote to retain Newt Gingrich as House speaker after Gingrich
admitted breaking House ethics rules. Campbell, who holds a
doctorate in economics from the University of Chicago and a law
degree from Harvard, is a fiscal conservative but is pro-choice and
has voted in favor of gun control legislation.
</P>
<P>
   He clerked for former Supreme Court Justice Byron White in the
late 1970s and worked for the Federal Trade Commission from 1981 to
1983 before becoming a Stanford law professor in 1983. He was
elected to Congress in 1988 and served two terms before running
unsuccessfully for the Senate in 1992. He returned to Congress in
1995 after former Rep. Norman Mineta, D-Calif., resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell says he opposed the Vietnam War and the U.S.-led North
Atlantic Treaty Organization involvement in Kosovo because he views
them both as civil wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't fault the president's intentions a bit,'' he says.
``But the Albanians are worse off after we started bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   But he insists he did not force the House vote on Kosovo policy
because of his own opposition to it. ``I really am coming at it
from the Constitution,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He and 16 other lawmakers also filed suit in a U.S. District
Court here on April 30 asking a judge to order Clinton to withdraw
troops or seek a declaration of war from Congress.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Presidents have argued that their role as commander-in-chief
allows them to send troops into battle without consulting Congress.
The 1973 War Powers Act was adopted in the waning days of the
Vietnam War as an effort to give lawmakers a greater say in
military conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   The law says that unless U.S. troops are under attack, a
president must obtain congressional approval before deploying
troops. In an emergency, the president has 48 hours to consult with
Congress on the military deployment and must remove troops within
60 days if Congress does not declare war.
</P>
<P>
   But the law has not stopped presidents from sending U.S. troops
into conflicts including Ronald Reagan's invasion of Grenada in
1983, George Bush's deployment of troops to Panama in 1995 and
Clinton's interventions in Somalia in 1993 and Bosnia in 1995. Bush
did seek and receive permission from Congress to conduct the
Persian Gulf War in 1991, although the vote came after the troops
were already in place.

<P>
   DALLAS _ In Dallas, unmarked cars are the chief weapon against
lawlessness. In suburban Arlington and Plano, undercover cops keep
an eye on high-crime venues. In suburban Richardson, special lights
mounted on poles signal police that offenses have occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big problem,'' said Richardson Deputy Police Chief
Larry Zacharias, ``and we take it very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Running red lights has become such a problem that for most of
the past year, police agencies in 27 cities and towns in the
Dallas-Fort Worth area have had special programs and units _
something like rolling SWAT teams and sting operations _ on the
streets to combat it.
</P>
<P>
   Scoffing at traffic lights is not just a North Texas phenomenon.
Across the country, police departments are considering a number of
extreme measures _ including installing cameras at key
intersections _ to control a problem which, according to U.S.
Department of Transportation estimates, causes 260,000 collisions
and 750 deaths each year.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Greater Dallas Injury Prevention Center,
red-light running is the most common cause of injury accidents and,
Zacharias said, they are the most serious because ``you are
broadsiding another vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dangers, motorists increasingly are ignoring them.
In Dallas, according to police statistics, the number of accidents
caused by running red lights increased 22 percent from 1992 to 1996
and in 1997, that violation contributed to 2,000 accidents. At some
Richardson intersections, red-light violations have increased 50
percent in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   So prevalent is the practice, police said, that during rush hour
at some busy intersections the lights are run nearly every time
they change.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the Richardson Police Department proposed a
coordinated crackdown throughout the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
Representatives of 27 police agencies, including some campus
police, signed on and adopted the slogan ``Red Still Means Stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, it is a motoring fundamental that many motorists seem
to have forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started in June,'' Zacharias said of the intensified
enforcement, ``and we wrote 7,000 tickets in six months.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It amazes me,'' said Arlington Lt. Travis Moore, ``that
driving behavior has changed as much as it has.''
</P>
<P>
   Arlington's approach was to establish a squad of plainclothes
traffic cops who pose as surveyors at high-traffic intersections.
When a car runs a light, the ``surveyors'' write down the tag
number and radio it to a motorcycle officer a block down the
street.
</P>
<P>
   Although Moore had no tally of the tickets that have resulted
from the program, he said it has appeared to lower the accident
rates at some intersections. It is not uncommon, he said, for
officers to issue 50 or 60 citations in a two-hour period.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, we're not even going after the ones who are close,'' he
said. ``We only stop the ones who are at least a car length out
when the light turns red.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people have complained about the use of undercover
cops, he said, but he thinks it is the only way to change driving
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will behave if they see a police car,'' he said, ``but
then they go back to their old ways when it is gone. We hope that
this will make them think about what they are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen Nguyen, a 20-year-old college student, was one of those
who cried ``foul'' when he was caught by undercover officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aw, man, that's not right,'' he complained to the Arlington
Morning News. ``If you want to stop it (light running), have
somebody in a marked car stationed out there. If I saw a cop out
there, I wouldn't run a red light.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude, Moore said, is what the police department is
trying to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't have to put an officer at every intersection,''
he said. ``That's why we put lights there.''
</P>
<P>
   Police in Plano are using a similar tactic, with officers in
plainclothes milling around intersections and posing as
construction workers or commuters waiting for a bus.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year the department has issued 3,092 tickets for red
light violations, double the number issued in the previous 12
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``People complain,'' said police spokesman Carl Duke. ``They
say, `Why are you out writing tickets? You should be arresting
criminals.' I have to explain that we should be writing tickets. We
have a traffic unit and that's their job.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas police have taken a broader approach by targeting other
symptoms of road rage or aggressive driving _ speeding, tailgating
and erratic lane changing _ as well as blowing through red lights.
</P>
<P>
   Called STARR (Strategic Targeting Against Road Rage), the
enforcement is carried out with the help of six blue Ford Crown
Victorias that cruise the major thoroughfares. The cars are
unmarked and equipped with red and blue strobe lights mounted on
the inside. The officers driving them, however, wear uniforms and
are prohibited from chasing violators.
</P>
<P>
   The cars were put into service last November and in the first
four months, officers operating them issued 11,164 citations _ an
increase of 8,800 over the number issued during the same period a
year earlier. There also were 540 fewer accidents on Dallas
streets, compared with the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not a lot of magic formulas,'' said police spokesman
John Leggio. ``You just get out there and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some police departments are experimenting with technological, if
not magical, formulas to supplement the unmarked cars and, perhaps,
replace the undercover officers.
</P>
<P>
   Arlington, Richardson and Plano and a few other cities have
installed white lights on traffic signal poles. When the light
changes to red, the white bulb, which can be observed by an officer
from any direction, flashes on, signaling to the officer that any
car subsequently crossing the intersection has run a red light.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras may be next. Richardson has tested a camera-monitoring
system at one intersection and the Dallas City Council's
Legislative Affairs Committee recently voiced support for
legislation that would permit photographing red-light runners and
issuing tickets to them by mail.
</P>
<P>
   Unmarked cars. Undercover cops. Electronic gadgets.
Surreptitious photography. Extreme measures, perhaps, but,
Richardson's Zacharias said, the public seems to support the effort
to curb dangerous drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not had one complaint about our program,'' he said,
``except from those who have been caught.''

I WANT MY MTV ... LIKE IT USED TO BE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not long ago, MTV held its ``I Wanna Be a VJ Too'' contest, the
winner of which earned a yearlong spot as an MTV VJ.
</P>
<P>
   This was a big deal, drawing 6,000 entrants in tryouts in Los
Angeles, New York and Chicago. The contestants were winnowed down,
like beauty-pageant entrants, to five finalists, who were tested on
their music knowledge, poise and stamina. Then viewers chose the
winner, Thalia D. DaCosta of Sunrise, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   DaCosta is 21, which means she would have been 3 or 4 when MTV
went on the air in August 1981. Back when MTV mattered _ or at
least mattered more.
</P>
<P>
   That the news media would even report the contest shows that
SOMEONE believes MTV matters, at least a little. But in the nearly
20 years since it reinvented music programming, leading to spinoffs
and competitors of varying size and clout, it has mattered less and
less.
</P>
<P>
   And that irrelevance is based on the same complaint MTV has been
drawing for nearly a decade _ that the music-video channel doesn't
play enough videos. A weekday of watching bore this out: From 8
a.m. to 2:30 p.m., only 12 videos aired. When videos returned at
2:30 with the countdown show ``Total Request Live,'' they were
abridged _ the better to make room for fan e-mails and
pronouncements (''Joey McIntire is so cute, I want him so bad
...''). Full-length videos didn't return till ``MTV Jams
Countdown'' _ that's right, another countdown show, this one
hip-hop based _ at 4:30.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of videos wouldn't be such a big deal, if it weren't
for three things: 1) Most of MTV's original programming is mediocre
at best; 2) other music-TV networks either have better original
programming or play more videos; and 3) the vast majority of music
videos that MTV does air are pretty dull, and consist largely of
the Top 40 fare that diminishes the channel's cutting-edge
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   So why would people still want their MTV? Consider the recent
``I Was an MTV VJ Too,'' a brief documentary about MTV's late-'80s
VJs that had a nostalgia factor yanked from the subconscious (who
even remembers Kevin Seal?). This was the most interesting nonmusic
show seen on MTV in recent weeks; nothing like seeing Daisy Fuentes
in her pre-MTV days, as a big-haired weatherwoman on a
Spanish-language TV station in New York. It was also a rare
instance in which MTV beat another music network at its own game.
</P>
<P>
   That network is VH1, MTV's boomer-friendly sister channel, the
second-most popular video network with an estimated 62.4 million
``subscribers'' (MTV has an estimated 68 million, but
``subscribers'' don't equal ``viewers''). VH1 went on the air in
1985, playing distressingly middle-of-the-road adult-contemporary
videos before going through a series of phases: ``adult
alternative'' (pre-fame Shawn Colvin), MTV's greatest hits (an
early-'90s love affair with video's early-'80s heyday), and, in its
latest and best incarnation, the pop-culture channel.
</P>
<P>
   Like MTV, VH1 has steered away from just playing videos. Nobody
complains, though, because VH1's original programming is almost
unfailingly entertaining: ``Pop-Up Video,'' a
much-imitated-never-matched mix of factoids and snarky commentary,
led the revolution, which now includes a seemingly endless supply
of ``Where Are They Now'' and ``Before They Were Rock Stars''
programs. These are watchable at worst, addictive at best. MTV's
efforts to imitate them, such as ``BIOrhythm,'' have yet to catch
on, perhaps because in the quick-turnover world of late-'90s pop
music, nobody's around long enough to HAVE a biography. How much of
a life story could the Backstreet Boys have compared to, say,
Fleetwood Mac?
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   The day of MTV-watching _ the one that included a dozen videos
between 8 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. _ included original programming like
this: ``Station Zero,'' a hip-hop cartoon that's a poorly animated,
poorly written hybrid of ``Fat Albert'' and ``Beavis and
Butt-head.'' An hour (two episodes) of ``FANatic,'' in which
obsessed fans get to meet and interview the stars they idolize. A
half-hour Drew Barrymore special. And THREE hours (six episodes) of
``Road Rules,'' just in case you needed to catch up with the antics
of a bunch of squabbling, self-absorbed twentysomethings crammed
into an RV traveling through Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   This, from a network that says it's renewing its commitment to
music programming. There is music programming on MTV, generally
from 1 to 5 a.m., as well as on the Sunday-night show ``120
Minutes,'' the network's last connection with anything resembling
cutting-edge.
</P>
<P>
   You can't totally blame MTV for its long-lasting identity crisis
because, frankly, most music videos today are pretty bland. Last
year brought only one potential classic _ Garbage's bizarro clip
for ``Push It.'' The '90s as a whole have given us few knockouts
(the Beastie Boys' ``Sabotage,'' Soundgarden's ``Black Hole Sun,''
Beck's ``Loser''). And even the best current videos _
``Girlfriend/Boyfriend'' by BLACKstreet and Janet Jackson, ``Why
Don't You Get a Job?'' by the Offspring, ``Freak on a Leash'' by
Korn _ can't hold a candle to earlier '90s entries, much less such
'80s classics as Peter Gabriel's ``Sledgehammer.''
</P>
<P>
   Which could be why networks that air more videos haven't caught
on. MuchMusic, a Canadian music channel, aired for about a year on
Arlington's TCI Digital Cable before vanishing at the beginning of
this month; Matt Fleury, a Denver-based TCI spokesman, says
MuchMusic was taken out of digital-cable packaging. Too bad;
MuchMusic looked like early MTV with its mix of videos and
concerts, and it actually played artists ``you might not have heard
of.'' MTV's spinoff, M2, does plays music videos 24-7, but it's
only available on satellite, and an hour of watching its heavily
mixed bag (much of which can be seen on MTV or VH1) can help you
understand why MTV drifted from all-video programming.
</P>
<P>
   On the country side of the clicker, upstart Great American
Country is mounting an assault against 16-year-old Country Music
Television. GAC, which went on the air nationwide in September
1996, boasts that it plays 400 more videos a week than its
competitors, along with fewer commercials. CMT airs more videos
than most music channels, but also takes the VH1/MTV route of
airing nonvideo programming.
</P>
<P>
   Although country videos are often more slow-paced and soft-focus
than their pop counterparts, clips by Montgomery Gentry and Shane
Minor revealed a strong MTV influence, with rapid cutting and, in
Minor's case, dancing girls.
</P>
<P>
   This may be the way in which MTV still matters most _ as an
influence. Without it, the existence of the other video networks
(or heavy video programming on such channels as Black Entertainment
Network and the Nashville Network) would be unlikely. During its 18
years, MTV has filtered into advertising, radio-station programming
and movies (such as last fall's busy ``Belly,'' directed by video
auteur Hype Williams).
</P>
<P>
   But MTV has become stagnant, despite the occasional timely news
report (the recent teen-violence documentary ``Warning Signs''
received some strong reviews in the wake of the Littleton, Colo.,
high school massacre) or guilty pleasure along the lines of
``Beavis and Butt-head'' and the late-night call-in advice show
``Loveline.''
</P>
<P>
   As the channel reaches adulthood, it's having a harder time
being groundbreaking. The incessant airing of its ``Real World''
and ``Road Rules'' series betrays a dearth of original-programming
ideas. If you can find the videos, though, the network can give you
a crash course in surface pop culture. Want to know why people are
yakking about Eminem and Ricky Martin? Tune in to ``Total Request
Live'' for an hour a week, and don't surf away during the
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   But it shouldn't take that much effort; you shouldn't have to
check a TV book to find out when the pioneer video-music channel is
playing videos. If you want anything of any depth, you're going to
have to make an extra effort and do some research. But if you just
want a quick cross section of what's out there, MTV may be for you.
It might be a good idea, however, to watch much of it with the
picture off.

 &HT;    ALBANIA TO TAKE UP TO 1 MILLION MORE REFUGEES, BUT WANTS THEM
RELOCATED
 &HT;    By MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ The Albanian government pledged Friday to take
in fully one million Kosovar refugees, more than double the number
it has sheltered so far, as neighboring Macedonia readied to begin
transferring tens of thousands of refugees who fled there.
</P>
<P>
   The first 6,000 ethnic Albanians from Yugoslavia are expected to
leave Macedonia on Sunday, according to Dennis McNamara, the
special envoy of the United Nations refugee agency. They will be
followed by others into southeastern Albania around the city of
Korce.
</P>
<P>
   McNamara, who visited here briefly Friday on a tour of the
region, also stressed that Kosovars in this crowded border area
must get ready to evacuate immediately.
</P>
<P>
   He did not say they would be forced to leave now, but made it
clear that failure to clear this militarily volatile area will lead
to the closure of tent camps sheltering more than 30,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't close the tents on top of the refugees, but we will
use every method we can to persuade them to move,'' he said. ``We
are going to tell them that at a certain point, these camps will
not be there. The services they currently enjoy will not be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Under increasing pressure from the Albanian government to move
the Kosovars south, the United National High Commissioner for
Refugees said for the first time this week that it may be forced to
simply shut down the camps.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of cross-border attacks from Serb-controlled
Yugoslavia is a main reason both the government and the UN want the
refugees here to relocate. Besides the possibility of a tent camp
being hit, authorities fear the shelling of a road or bridge could
cut off access to this area and leave more than 100,000 refugees --
plus local residents -- without access to food or other supplies.
</P>
<P>
   About 70,000 refugees are staying in private homes or camping on
their own in this region.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian government also fears social and political
problems, as well as the potential of disease and deprivation as
summer approaches and the heavily taxed water supply diminishes by
two-thirds of the present capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement to take in as many as one million refugees came as
neighboring Macedonia demanded that other nations help lift the
burden of about 200,000 ethnic Albanians who fled there from
Yugoslavia. Macedonia is a fragile mix of ethnic groups, and
leaders have said they fear the heavy addition of Albanians will
dislodge the tenuous balance.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Macedonian authorities continued to choke off the
refugee flow at the Kosovo border, forcing hundreds of Kosovars
fleeing Serb troops to find more treacherous mountain routes across
a harsh frontier dotted with land mines, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of increasing refugee flow, the regular border
points were nearly deserted. Only people with Macedonian passports
or travel papers were allowed across at Blace, 12 miles northwest
of the capital of Skopje.
</P>
<P>
   The few people who managed to cross said there were 300 to 400
people on the other side of the border in the town of Djeneral
Jankovic. The refugees there were reportedly huddled outside in a
persistent drizzle.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, cash-poor Albania already has accepted more than
400,000 refugees, so has agreed to more than double the numbers. In
the last several days the volume of refugees crossing the border
here has diminished, but relief officials believe new waves could
come at any time if the Serb authorities in charge in Kosovo allow
more to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Friday, the Kosovo Liberation Army held a news
conference in which KLA leaders said conditions in some parts of
Kosovo are becoming critical. Spokesman Gani Syla said some areas
are almost totally without food, and called for a humanitarian
corridor through which relief supplies could be sent to civilians
remaining there.
</P>
<P>
   The guerilla separatist group, which has been fighting for
Kosovo's independence from Yugoslavia, also said its doctors claim
Serb forces have used chemical weapons and nerve gas, which
resulted in the deaths of two young boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serbia is making Kosovo and its people live as though in
prehistoric times,'' Syla said.

`NO SENSE' TO SLEDGEHAMMER SLAYING OF SMALL-TOWN MINISTER, WIFE 
 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WEIMAR, Texas _ Grieving members of the Weimar United Church of
Christ, fighting back tears, stooped under a hot sun and planted
rows of bright flowers in the church courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if those who loved and cared for the Rev. Norman
``Skip'' Sirnic and his wife, Karen, hoped the simple beauty of
flowers would overpower the dark and confusing horror of their
unsolved murders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make sense, but violence never does,'' said Mark
Sirnic, a 44-year-old minister from Colorado and Skip Sirnic's
younger brother.
</P>
<P>
   The murders of Sirnic, 46, and his wife Karen, 47, have brought
fear, confusion and sadness to this hamlet of 2,052 residents
nestled in the rolling hills 90 miles west of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Sirnics were bludgeoned to death with a sledgehammer
as they lay in bed last weekend, violent crime was almost unknown
in this picture postcard community established by German and Czech
settlers in the 1870s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pretty crime-free little town, until this thing
happened,'' said longtime mayor Bennie Kosler, owner of Bennie's
Cafe on Mechanic Street. ``It just leaves the whole town in
shock.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think it is someone local,'' the mayor added.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a week of extensive investigation by police in Weimar,
with help from Texas Rangers and the county sheriff, no arrests
have been made nor any suspects identified, Police Chief Bill
Livingston acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't have anything new,'' he said. The Sirnics'
1998 red Mazda pickup, with Texas license 2DK-J47, had not been
found as of late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston said an intruder broke into the rear of the couple's
home, a parsonage behind the United Church of Christ, and attacked
the couple with a sledgehammer. The mayor said that whoever broke
in used a glass cutter, and found a sledgehammer in a cabinet or
storeroom.
</P>
<P>
   The Weimar Mercury reported that the murder weapon was found
leaning against a wall in the bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   And while police first noticed only a few possessions missing _
a VCR, video games and their truck _ Livingston said a check with
family members has now lengthened the list and added to its value.
Family members say some jewelry was stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have discovered other things missing,'' the chief said,
declining to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   The couple was last seen on Friday, April 30, and their pickup
was missing from the carport early Saturday morning and has not
been located. Church officials, alarmed when Sirnic and his wife,
the church secretary, did not appear at services last Sunday, May
2, went to the parsonage and found them in bed and beaten to death.
</P>
<P>
   One resident, who asked not to be named, theorized that a
stranger hitching a ride on a freight train would have passed
within yards of the parsonage since it is next to the rail line. It
would have been easy to hop off a freight train and walk up to the
home, the resident said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a 35-hour head start and could have been out of the
country before anybody knew what happened,'' the resident said.
</P>
<P>
   With few clues, friends and family are left to wonder who killed
the popular couple, and why.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to figure any kind of motive and you know, we
don't know of anyone who had a sour relationship with them. He was
one of the good guys, a golden boy,'' said Mark Sirnic, the
minister's brother. ``At this church, ministers do not make a lot
of money. They did not have many material possessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless it was someone who had no clue as to what was in the
house and was just randomly hitting some house.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who knew the Sirnics describe them as an energetic,
compassionate, well-educated and intelligent couple who had
dedicated themselves to bettering the communities of Weimar and
neighboring New Bielau. In addition to his duties at the 375-member
Weimar United Church _ established in November 1988 _ Sirnic was
also pastor at the Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church in New
Bielau, a small community eight miles south of Weimar.
</P>
<P>
   Sirnic, born in Pennsylvania, moved to Texas in 1964, graduating
as valedictorian of his class at Friona High School in 1970. He
graduated with honors from Trinity University in San Antonio, and
studied for the ministry at Vanderbilt Divinity School. He was
ordained in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and church members in Weimar and New Bielau describe
Skip Sirnic as a down-to-earth man who did not preach to his
congregation, but rather engaged them in conversations about God.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very humble man, and just funny as all get out. He
had a wonderful sense of humor,'' said Helen Boysen, a member of
the Lutheran congregation in New Bielau.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost as if he talked with us about God and the Bible
and the way the Bible instructs us to live. He brought the Bible
alive for us, truly.''
</P>
<P>
   In the decade since Sirnic and his wife came to Weimar and New
Bielau, both churches flourished and gained members.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Sirnic, a native of Bryan, Texas, earned degrees in
biochemistry from Texas A&AMP;M University, and was still conducting
research at A&AMP;M, the family said.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, she became church secretary, sang in the choir, was
president of the Weimar Literary Guild and a member of the town's
garden club. She also oversaw a church youth program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I can tell you other than it's such a shame
the community lost these two kids and the work they could do,''
said Anna Belle Mohr, the mother of the slain minister. ``They both
loved the community _ he loved both communities he served.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, more than 1,200 people attended a memorial service
for the Sirnics at the Weimar United Church, and plans are under
way to erect a memorial garden to the slain couple in the city
cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable that this has happened,'' said Boysen, who
moved with her husband to New Bielau from San Antonio two years
ago. ``It's such an innocent community.''

 By JANNY SCOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Judith Rich Harris published an article in a scholarly
journal a few years back and put the words ``Middletown, New
Jersey'' in the space usually reserved for an author's academic
affiliation, she found herself deluged with what she now calls her
``who-the-hell-are-you mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only had she listed no university. She had not thanked any
august-sounding grant-making agencies, either. She had simply
credited a half-dozen individuals, including one Charles S. Harris,
who any half-alert reader might have guessed is her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got this e-mail from a professor at Cornell University,''
Ms. Harris recalled recently. He wanted to know: Are you an
academic? A clinician? Or perhaps ``an unemployed steel worker who
has an interesting hobby of writing seminal scientific articles?''
</P>
<P>
   None of the above.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harris, who rocketed out of obscurity last year when she
published ``The Nurture Assumption'' (Free Press, 1998), her
joltingly unorthodox book on the greater influence of peers than
parents in child development, is a member of a little known and
endangered subspecies of American intellectual known as the
independent scholar.
</P>
<P>
   In a country in which the academy has been accused of vacuuming
up all of intellectual life and processing it into something less
deserving of the name, some scholars have traded the satisfactions
and frustrations of colleges and universities for the mixed
blessings of independence.
</P>
<P>
   They are outsiders _ without titles, without tenure, without
steady income. They have no letterhead, no lavish library
privileges. As James Trilling, an independent scholar of Byzantine
art studies and the history of ornament, said when asked about the
drawbacks: ``No colleagues. No students. No paycheck.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet they are free to think and write whatever, whenever and
however they choose. They operate unencumbered by academic
politics, protocol and publish-or-perish pressures. They straddle
disciplines, elude specialization, follow their noses. For better
or worse, their work is free to be unconventional and new.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no vested interest in the status quo,'' Ms. Harris said
of her book. ``Secondly, I had nobody to please. I didn't have to
worry about offending the head of my department, about getting put
in an office without a window, about being made to teach
statistics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I see myself as a sort of gadfly,'' said Ms. Harris, whose
book argues that parents are less important, and peers more, than
many experts in child development have thought. ``I think I'm in a
much better position to criticize the field because I'm not a
member of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The independents' reception by academics is not always warm.
</P>
<P>
   The current issue of The New York Review of Books includes a
letter signed by 29 academics complaining that the publication used
Thomas Powers, best known as an author of books on politics and
current affairs, to review several books about Crazy Horse, Sitting
Bull and other 19th-century Plains Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Firing back, the New York Review's editors respond that Powers
had been studying those subjects for years. ``It is hard to take
seriously academics who condemn an independent scholar without
making a single substantive criticism of his work,'' the editors
retort.
</P>
<P>
   One of the better known independent scholars is Anne Hollander,
whose subject is dress. An art historian, she graduated from
Barnard College in 1952, well before the advent of cultural
studies, at a time when the image of the clad figure was, she said
recently, ``not an appropriate art historical subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of going to graduate school, she married an academic.
She lived for years as an academic ``fellow traveler'' in places
like New Haven and Cambridge, Mass., always thinking about and
studying the representation of clothing in paintings and
literature, and cornering people at parties to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a friend persuaded her to write an article on the
subject for a new journal. That led to a contract for her first
book, ``Seeing Through Clothes'' (Viking, 1978), then a Guggenheim
fellowship, a second book and her third and latest book, ``Sex and
Suits: The Evolution of Modern Dress'' (Kodansha, 1995).
</P>
<P>
   Dress is now a well-established subject for serious study. Ms.
Hollander is about to publish her fourth book on the subject and is
working on a fifth. She is in constant demand from journalists, who
call regularly, asking questions that begin, ``What does it mean
that we are now wearing . . . ?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what she had forgone by not becoming an academic, she
said, ``What I did not have, and still feel nervous about, is an
alma mater, an encompassing institution, the whole institution of
the academy that supports all these guys and endorses their sorrows
and their efforts and produces a network within which they can feel
they have a perpetual identity that is theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a deep and abiding sense of myself as part of
this dynamic organism. It means that, every time I do anything, I
have to start from scratch. I have only my public and I have no
idea who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time, not all that long ago, when autonomy was not
odd. As Trilling points out, many of the great texts of the 19th
and early 20th centuries were produced by people working outside
the academy at the time, people like John Ruskin, Charles Darwin
and John Stuart Mill.
</P>
<P>
   But as the academy grew, autonomy waned. These days, many
scholars who are unaffiliated did not initially volunteer for the
part. Some were in dual-career marriages, unable to move for a job;
some came out of graduate school in the mid-1970s, just as the
academic job market was crashing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many have one thing in common: they describe themselves as
too ornery for academic life. They say their interests are too
eclectic. They resist the degree of specialization they say is
required of present-day professors. Some say they have no instinct
for institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Lesser, a critic, essayist and founding editor of the
literary journal The Threepenny Review, who drifted away from
universities after getting a doctorate in English, says that while
academia gave her admiration for ``impractical thought,'' she would
have made a poor academic.
</P>
<P>
   In her new book, ``The Amateur: An Independent Life of Letters''
(Pantheon, 1999), she says she gradually discovered she was not
much of a teacher, was ``hapless'' at dealing with departmental
politics, made enemies left and right and wanted to kill most of
her colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, if I had to give a single reason, I would say I
wasn't suited to the academy because I wanted to exercise a kind of
judgment that was not normal there,'' she writes. There seemed to
be no room for the kind of ``relatively untutored omnivorousness''
she wanted and needed to practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to have arbitrary lines drawn between things:
between old masterpieces and contemporary works, between art and
the rest of the world, between criticism and conversation,'' she
adds. ``I wanted the whole terrain. And in my own tiny way, I got
it.''
(MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Independence is not easy.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lesser, who lives in Berkeley with her husband and son,
rarely knows where her next year's income will come from. ``The
Amateur'' is the first of her five books to generate more than
$10,000. She has gotten fellowships, ranging from $20,000 to
$50,000, and does consulting and freelance writing.
</P>
<P>
   Trilling, who got his doctorate in art history from Harvard and
is the son of Lionel and Diana Trilling, gave up his job as a
curator at the Textile Museum in Washington to live in Providence,
R.I., with his wife, a tenured professor at Brown, who currently
supports him and their two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   He calls himself ``the liberated parasite.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have day jobs. Neil Baldwin, who has published
biographies of William Carlos Williams, Thomas Edison and Man Ray,
spends his weeks as executive director of the National Book
Foundation in New York City and his weekends working on his next
book in his study at home in Montclair, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   He can be found reading, say, Isaiah Berlin on an exercise
bicycle at the Essex Health and Country Club in West Orange, N.J.
In Worcester, Mass., Mr. Trilling, who has written books,
monographs and articles on topics like the mosaic pavement of the
Byzantine imperial palace in Constantinople, can be spotted in the
balcony above the pool at the YWCA, scribbling notes while his
daughter practices synchronized swimming.
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Isolation can be a problem for many independent scholars.
Trilling can go for months without speaking to a colleague. Except
when he attends conferences or lectures, he is cut off from the
shop talk and everyday sharing of ideas that are a feature of
university life.
</P>
<P>
   But the hardest part, he said, is having no students. He has far
more ideas than he will ever have time to develop into articles or
books, but he has no students to pass them on to. At the end of his
career, he will be unable to survey the landscape and take stock of
where his former students have gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students are a measure of your career,'' he said recently, in
his house in Providence, settled in the basement office he shares
with a large pet snake. ``That's never going to be so for me.
Teachers live on through their students, as well as through their
published work.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harris, who says she was ``kicked out of Harvard'' as a
graduate student in psychology in 1961, having been told she seemed
unlikely to do important work, wrote psychology textbooks for many
years, then one day hit upon the theory that became the central
idea of her paper and book.
</P>
<P>
   Because she suffers from a combination of autoimmune diseases,
she rarely leaves her house. She has gone entire months without
seeing anyone but her husband and a friend who cleans the house.
She is an energetic user of e-mail, maintaining a voluminous
correspondence with academics she has never met.
</P>
<P>
   To keep up with developments in her field, she subscribes to
journals and fires off printed postcards asking researchers for
reprints of their papers. She has relied so heavily on interlibrary
loans, she ended up thanking the librarians in Middletown and Red
Bank, N.J. in the preface to her book.
</P>
<P>
   Other independent scholars use their alumni borrowing privileges
_ or their spouses' _ to get access to university libraries. Some
follow a piece of advice once offered in a newsletter published by
a group called the National Coalition of Independent Scholars:
``Get a nonposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan Cassell, an anthropologist in St. Louis, acquired the title
of ``research associate'' from Washington University, solving both
the library problem and what she calls ``the name tag problem'' of
people's eyes glazing over as they read her name tag at meetings
and look past her for someone more important.
</P>
<P>
   So, are they contented?
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's contented?'' Wendy Lesser recalls having answered, when
asked about her state of mind while on a book tour recently.
``You're dead if you're contented. Nothing is perfect.''

IVAN THE TERRIBLE'S GUIDE TO LIVING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN VAROLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only a few years ago, thanks to decades of Soviet propaganda,
the word ``Domostroi'' _ the title of a 16th-century guide to
living written by the spiritual mentor of Ivan the Terrible _
conjured up images of medieval horrors, including instructions on
how to beat one's wife properly. (Actually, it says simply that a
man should deal ``sternly'' with a wayward wife.)
</P>
<P>
   Domostroi, which translates awkwardly as ``home-building,'' was
essentially good housekeeping for medieval Russians. Compiled in
the mid-1500s by Silvester, a Russian Orthodox priest, it is a mix
of Orthodox teaching and Russian folk traditions.
</P>
<P>
   In the seven years since it was placed on sale to the general
public for the first time in post-Soviet Russia, copies have found
their way into many homes. Publishers herald it as wise moral
instruction for today's lost generation. They may not be all wrong.
Much about life in Russia is eternal and the Domostroi unexpectedly
provides some apt guidance. Consider:
</P>
<P>
   FOREIGN GOODS: Chapter 47 encourages one ``to buy all sorts of
foreign goods ... as much as you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's manufactured goods are notorious for chronic defects
and poor quality. Indeed, before a devaluation of the ruble in
August, some 60 percent of the country's consumer goods were
imported, and they still enjoy great popularity among Russians,
even though jumping in price.
</P>
<P>
   DRINKING: Chapter 15 warns, ``See the embarrassment and reproach
in the fruitless waste that is drinking. If you ever go away drunk
and fall asleep on the road, then you'll never make it home, and
you will pay dearly for it. They'll steal all your clothes from
you. And if you do not regain your sobriety, you will lose both
your body and your soul, for many drunkards have perished from wine
and frozen to death along the roadside.''
</P>
<P>
   Wintry Russian streets are still full of sleeping drunks, not
only homeless people but often more propertied members of the
community as well. Last year in Moscow alone, 557 people froze to
death.
</P>
<P>
   PREPAREDNESS: Chapter 40 says, ``An upstanding man and a proper
wife, and all thinking and reasonable people, are careful to store
up on various items for the home, foodstuffs, and drink. ... An
upstanding man and an upstanding woman will not want during a time
of deficit.''
</P>
<P>
   A relevant observation during the financial crisis in August,
when the ruble's 70 percent devaluation led store owners to pull
goods off the shelves until the currency stabilized.
</P>
<P>
   SPIRITUAL REMEDIES: Chapter 8 urges those suffering from
``God-sent'' illnesses to cure themselves ``by asking for God's
mercy with tears and prayers, and fasting and by giving alms to the
poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the state of the contemporary Russian hospital, where
supply shortages are chronic and tipsy doctors not uncommon, there
may not be many alternatives to the Domostroi's advice. In the
1990s, Russian life expectancy is said to have dropped from 63.8
years to 57.7 years for men, and from 74.4 years to 71.2 years for
women.
</P>
<P>
   CALUMNY: Chapter 10 declares, ``Do not express any lie, slander
and deceit toward the Czar, prince or any member of the aristocracy
_ God will destroy anyone speaking such lies.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, such exhortations have been ignored as Russia's political
and economic elite have made a national sport out of publicizing
compromising material against one another. In the latest round, the
Russian tycoon Boris Berezovsky and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
have been flinging charges of corruption back and forth. The
conflict has even ensnared the Russian prosecutor general, Yuri
Skuratov, whom the Kremlin is trying to oust. Russian state
television recently broadcast a video showing the married Skuratov
in bed with two young women.
</P>
<P>
   RESPECT FOR AUTHORITY: Also in Chapter 10: ``Be afraid of the
Czar and serve him faithfully ... as if he were God, and subject
yourself to him in all manners.''
</P>
<P>
   Fear of authority, especially of the supreme ruler, is one of
the central tenets of the Domostroi and is deeply rooted in the
Russian mentality even today. How else to explain why the unpopular
president, Boris Yeltsin, still manages to hold onto power?

HEARST-ARGYLE TELEVISION REPORTS RESULTS FOR FIRST QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hearst-Argyle Television, Inc. on Friday announced
operating results for the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   On a GAAP-reported basis, revenues for the three months grew
nearly 30 percent, to $113.4 million; broadcast cash flow (station
operating income, plus depreciation and amortization, plus
amortization of program rights, minus program payments) grew 33.5
percent, to $45.0 million.
</P>
<P>
   After-tax cash flow (income before extraordinary item, plus
depreciation and amortization), a key financial measurement for
broadcast companies, grew nearly 30 percent to $19.1 million, or
$0.33 per share. Income applicable to common stockholders was $2.5
million, or $0.04 per share.
</P>
<P>
   In order to provide ``same-station'' comparable results, the
company also presented pro forma results including all its current
stations as though the company had owned all the stations on Jan. 1
of each year.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst-Argyle completed its acquisition of the Sacramento,
Calif., properties of Kelly Broadcasting last Jan. 5, and of the
Pulitzer Broadcasting stations on March 18.
</P>
<P>
   On a pro forma basis for the quarter, revenues grew 2.3 percent,
to $161.5 million; broadcast cash flow rose 3.1 percent to $63.6
million; and after-tax cash flow grew 1.4 percent, to $29.7 million
or $0.33 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Loss per common share on a pro forma basis narrowed to $(0.01),
from $(0.03) in the first quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've really hit the ground running after completing the
Pulitzer Broadcasting acquisition in March,'' said Bob Marbut,
Hearst-Argyle Television chairman and co-chief executive officer.
``Significantly, we had our seventh consecutive quarter of cash
flow margin improvement and after-tax cash flow growth on both a
GAAP and pro forma basis.''
</P>
<P>
   John G. Conomikes, Hearst-Argyle Television president and
co-chief executive officer, said the second quarter looks like ``it
could be below last year's very strong second quarter.'' He cited
some softness in national advertising categories, continued ratings
pressure at ABC and very difficult ratings comparisons for NBC,
which had the Seinfeld finale in last year's second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Notwithstanding this slow start to the first half, preliminary
indications for the third quarter are for solid growth,'' Conomikes
said.

TALK OF JAPAN'S RESUSCITATION MAY BE GREATLY EXAGGERATED  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 9) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Whew. Glad (italics)that(end italics) crisis is
over.
</P>
<P>
   From Bangkok to Berlin, people are celebrating the end of the
global turmoil that started in Asia nearly two years ago _
investors, that is, not the unemployed of Indonesia, Thailand and
South Korea, who are wondering what all the excitement is about.
</P>
<P>
   While real economies languish, stock markets are surging.
Thailand was up 10 percent on Wednesday. The South Koreans fret
that their currency may be getting (italics)too(end italics)
strong. Hong Kong just witnessed its own Internet frenzy. Even
Russia's market is rising, now that the International Monetary Fund
has agreed to make believe the country can pay its debts.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, this is a pretty nervous group of partygoers. Catch
a finance minister or central banker in a moment of candor, and you
discover someone surveying the land for signs of imminent
eruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few of the favorite worst-case scenarios kicking
around: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics)The fate of the world economy rests on the performance
of Yahoo and a handful of other American stocks. If they buckle,
kiss the rest of the world's markets goodbye.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Overly simplistic it may be, but this thinking has a certain gut
appeal. American consumers are on a spending spree, egged on by a
wealth effect based on how much a rising market has added to their
net worth.
</P>
<P>
   Sung Won Sohn of Wells Fargo Economics notes that housing and
traditional consumer spending equaled 119 percent of the amount by
which the economy grew in the first quarter, meaning consumers more
than compensated for a sharp fall in exports.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market's rise, in turn, is built on a strikingly small
galaxy of star stocks, though the galaxy has grown a bit lately.
</P>
<P>
   So the theory goes that if those stocks crack, consumer spending
cracks, too, ravaging the rest of the market. And as America stops
sucking in the world's exports, countries and regions that depend
on American demand _ Japan, Latin America, Europe, Southeast Asia _
also go over a cliff.
</P>
<P>
   This theory is widely discussed in the upper reaches of the
Clinton adminstration, but never in public. ``Too radioactive,''
one of the president's economic advisers says. ``Too ugly to think
about.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics)The fate of the world economy has less to do with Yahoo
than with a bunch of yahoos in the Japanese parliament.(end
italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Washington politicians like this one more because it places the
blame on the world's second-largest economy. All hands nodded
politely as Japan's prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, explained last
week that the country's worst troubles were behind it, that the
recovery was in sight, that after seven years of fumbling the
government had figured out what to do. And as soon as Obuchi was
out of earshot, most of Clinton's advisers had the same reaction:
Yeah, right.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the fear: The Japanese government is spending roughly 8
percent of gross national product on a stimulus package to reflate
the economy and is predicting a growth rate of 0.5 percent this
year. Everyone else thinks the economy will go on shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   Even the International Monetary Fund, which hates to offend its
members, downgraded its 1999 projection to a 1.4 percent decline in
GNP.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the government's huge spending spree, Japanese companies
say they are still cutting back on capital investment in new plants
and technology. And that's where the disaster scenarios start.
</P>
<P>
   The government can't keep spending like that. ``They are pretty
much out at the limit now,'' says Edward Lincoln, a Brookings
Institution economist who once worked as special adviser to Walter
F. Mondale when he was ambassador to Japan. And when the tap runs
dry, Japan's slow retreat could turn to a rout _ a highly
contagious one.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Japanese legislators visiting Washington in recent weeks
acknowledged that they had no plan for speeding the restructuring
of Japanese industry, because that would mean more unemployment.
Instead, they talk about ``job preservation'' and steer the
conversation away from the Internet and toward the travails of rice
farming.
</P>
<P>
   Shades of 10 years ago, or 20. It suggests that Japan's
political system is still unable to come to terms with how its
economy must be transformed.
</P>
<P>
   (italics)Forget Yahoo and the Japanese yahoos. The real trouble
is a counterattack on a fellow named Zhu.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   That would be Zhu Rongji, China's prime minister. No sooner did
he arrive back from his trip to the United States than Chinese
businesses began assailing him for the concessions he made in
trying to gain membership for China in the World Trade Organzation.
</P>
<P>
   The telecommunications minister reportedly threatened to quit.
The government began hinting that some of the offers were coming
off the table and then ordered the removal of some foreign-origin
programs from satellite television systems _ not exactly an embrace
of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   China, of course, is still an economy unto itself. So even if
Zhu were to lose his war to modernize the economy, or China's
insolvent banks were to acknowledge their insolvency and go over
the edge, it might not matter much in the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it's a bigger country than Thailand. And look
what happened after a little problem there.

appears to be that while people may be created equal, they do not
necessarily die that way. On the swiftly calculated sliding scale
of death, disasters are assigned a news value based not on how many
lives were lost, but on how and where they happened to die. A
recent Arkansas boating accident that killed 13 people received far
less coverage than events that claimed a comparable number of
lives, such as an Amtrak crash or Colorado school shooting. By
David Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   CLEMENCY-POLITICS-REVIEW (San Francisco) _ It's a bad time to be
on death row. Politicians win points _ and votes _ by wearing the
tough-on-crime banner. In this environment, granting clemency has
become an act of courage that requires an outlay of political
capital few governors are willing to spend. In the current
political climate, clemency is nearly impossible. By Evelyn Nieves.
</P>
<P>
   GAMBLING-DOSTOYEVSKY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Among the problems to be
addressed or evaded in the coming report by the National Gambling
Impact Study Commission is the problem gambler. Some of the most
vivid accounts of gambling addiction in world literature come from
Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky, who for miserable years was an
unregenerate roulette punter in the casinos of Germany. By Walter
Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   ANIMAL-CRUELTY-REVIEW (Undated) _ For cats, dogs and other
animals, life in the movies is beginning to appear less than
glamorous. At this historical juncture of political correctness and
feeling the pain of others, pretending to hurt animals has become
an intentional laugh-getter in movies, TV and advertising. By
Douglas Martin.
</P>
<P>
   MILITARY-BOOKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The U.S.
military-literary-industrial complex is gathering might with the
surprising success of new books that portray modern warriors as
complex heroes who confront enemies and their own mistakes with a
mixture of courage and fear. By Doreen Carvajal.
</P>
<P>
   BBO-SCOUT-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Baseball scouting reports:
soft hands, bat-breaking kinks and other intimations of
immortality. Excerpts from scouting reports filed on players while
they were unknown amateurs.

   U.S.-EUROPE-JOBLESS (Undated) _ Europe's cradle-to-grave safety
net means not only that being out of work has become a viable way
of making a living, but that there is no longer much stigma
attached to joblessness. That goes a long way in explaining the
contrast between America's current jobs boom and the contrasting
jobs bust in Europe. By Sylvia Nasar.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-DIVISIONS-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ Such depictions of Israeli
society as an aggregate of groups, not individuals, reflect the
hardening of social divisions here in recent years. More than ever,
Israelis view each other as members of ideological, religious or
ethnic sub-units, rather than as one society with shared values. By
Joel Greenberg.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MONTENEGRO-REVIEW (Podgorica) _ Montenegro is unusually
hospitable to foreign journalists because the tiny republic is in
big trouble. Its new, Western-leaning government has all but pulled
out of the Yugoslav federation with Serbia. The Montenegrin
government is bending over backwards for foreign journalists
because it cannot allow the state-controlled Serbian media to
present the only images of what is actually happening. By Anthony
DePalma.

   KOSOVO-SERBIA-REVIEW (Undated) _ A bold, if impractical,
question is just now beginning to be formulated: Is it finally time
for outside powers to crush Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
to make the effort necessary to cure a national psychosis inside
Serbia that has been destabilizing a corner of Europe for a decade?
Put another way, has the time come for NATO to do in Serbia what
the Allies did in Germany and Japan after World II? By Blaine
Harden. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   COLO-SHOOTING-REVIEW (Washington) _ If there is anything left to
be said about the tragedy in Littleton, Colo., it may be this: the
cold, hard reality of the school massacre is that it was the
statistical equivalent of the proverbial needle in a haystack. And,
precisely because such events are so rare, and because it is
impossible to eliminate risk from life, there may be no larger
lessons to draw, and no way to prevent another one. By Sheryl Gay

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   An inch of snow coated the lowlands near Seattle on Friday, as a
deep layer of unseasonably chilly air over Alaska was discharged
southward into the Pacific Northwest. As the potent May sun heats
the lower atmosphere Saturday, vigorous currents of air will ascend
into the cold air, causing clouds and isolated afternoon
thunderstorms to form.
</P>
<P>
   Spotty afternoon thundershowers will also erupt over the
northern Rockies, along the leading edge of the advancing cold air.
Meanwhile, generally sunny and warm conditions will cover the
southern Rockies and Southwest with afternoon readings reaching 100
degrees near the California-Arizona border.
</P>
<P>
   Residual moisture behind departing low pressure will cause
clouds and spotty showers to linger across the central and western
Great Lakes Saturday. Daytime readings beneath the thick cloud
cover will be about 10 degrees cooler than average.
</P>
<P>
   A compact jet stream disturbance will cross the interior
Northeast, sparking a thin zone of showers and thunderstorms over
Pennsylvania and New York. The fast-moving system will cause any
precipitation that occurs to be brief, though small hail and gusty
winds will accompany a few of the storms.
</P>
<P>
   Cloudy and cool weather will persist near the Northeast seaboard
with spotty light rain and drizzle. Brighter conditions will return
to the region Sunday. The Southeast will be partly to mostly sunny
with lower humidity than in recent days. Thunderstorms will speckle
parts of Florida Saturday as a weak front interacts with sultry
air.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Double Record
</P>
<P>
   A weather event as rare as a triple play in baseball occurred in
Orlando, Fla., on Thursday. The mercury rose to a record 94
degrees, tying the previous maximum set in 1984. A thunderstorm
then deposited 1.21 inches of rain at the airport, marking the
wettest May 6 ever in the city. Typically, the hottest places are
also the driest. However, in a maritime climate such as on the
Florida peninsula, extreme temperatures also produce active sea
breezes. The meeting of the Atlantic and Gulf breezes near Orlando
resulted in potent thunderstorms, one of which rained itself out at
the airport.

FLOWER INDUSTRY IN COLOMBIA GROWS INTO A BIG BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla., Wash.) (rk) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUAYMARAL, Colombia _ The Acuarela flower farm here grows
nothing but roses of every hue, and Thursday morning workers were
rushing to fill the last Mother's Day orders from American clients.
</P>
<P>
   They snipped, chilled and bundled thousands of delicate buds
just starting to bloom, then quickly trucked them to the Bogota
airport for a three-hour flight to Miami and next-day delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when places like this were simple rustic
operations, but we have been transformed into an industry, and an
ever more competitive one at that,'' said Maria Eugenia Ramirez,
general manager of this 33-acre farm north of the Colombian
capital. ``Before a big holiday like this one or St. Valentine's
Day, we process more than 35,000 roses a day, a scale that would
have been unthinkable when our industry was born.''
</P>
<P>
   In a country plagued by narcotics trafficking and guerrilla war,
the flower export business is a rare success story. Exploiting
advances in transportation and refrigeration and its proximity to
the world's largest consumer market, Colombia has surpassed
California as the principal supplier of roses, carnations,
chrysanthemums and other popular blooms to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Barely 30 years ago a flower export industry did not exist here.
Today, two-thirds of all the fresh-cut flowers sold in the United
States are grown in Colombia, making this South American country
the biggest flower exporter beside the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Colombian flower producers earned $555 million from
exports, 80 percent of which went to the United States or Canada.
Exports have grown by more than 50 percent since 1992, helping to
make Miami International Airport the world's second-busiest cargo
destination, with an average of 30,000 boxes of Colombian flowers
arriving there daily.
</P>
<P>
   But now that success appears to be ushering in consolidation.
Colombia's achievements have not only encouraged Ecuador, Israel,
India, Kenya and Zimbabwe to expand flower-export operations, but
have caught the attention of multinational companies that want a
foothold here.
</P>
<P>
   The clearest sign of a new era is the arrival of Dole Food here.
In recent months, the American food giant has bought four of
Colombia's largest and most successful flower growers, which
account for about 25 percent of production.
</P>
<P>
   ``The arrival of a multinational with such a vast experience
with perishable products has meant a fundamental change for our
industry,'' said Felipe Ramirez, president of the board of the
Flower Exporter's Association of Colombia. ``We know this means an
increase in competition, that smaller producers are going to have
to seek alliances, but we think this is a healthy development that
will awaken demand and make us more innovative.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Dole has remained a passive owner. But Jose Maria de la
Torre, founder of Florex SA, a company Dole purchased last fall,
said that ``it is just a question of time before they take the
other leap'' and begin to merge their acquisitions here and utilize
their growing, refrigeration and distribution expertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may not know flower technology, but it's not Greek to
them, and some of what they know from other areas can probably be
applied to our industry,'' de la Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   The distribution end of the business, in which Colombian
producers also play an important role, is undergoing a similar
transformation. More than a half-dozen large flower importers in
the United States in which Colombian growers held interests have
been sold to USA Floral Products, a company with $1 billion in
annual sales formed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Poiret, USA Floral's chief executive officer, called its
role in relation to Dole ``more complementary than competitive.''
He did not rule out the possibility of buying farms here, but made
it clear that his focus now was on what he called ``the front end
of the train rather than the source.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Colombian growers have a product that is of exceptional
quality when it is cut from the stem,'' Poiret said in a telephone
interview from USA Floral's Washington headquarters. The challenge,
he said, is to minimize the time it takes to get fresh flowers to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   That is important to producers here because more flowers are
available and yet, according to industry studies, only a quarter of
American families bought flowers last year, spending an average of
$25 a person. In Europe, 60 percent of families bought flowers,
spending an average of $41 a person.
</P>
<P>
   Producers here have also spent years fighting a complaint filed
by growers in California accusing the Colombians of dumping, or
selling flowers at below cost to increase their market share. The
Colombians have denied the accusation, but a tentative settlement
was negotiated earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The accord calls for Colombian flower growers to pay at least
$7.5 million over the next 30 months into a fund that will create
advertisements urging Americans to buy more flowers. ``It's an
opportunity to spend money on something that will benefit all of us
who are growers instead of fighting each other and spending our
money on lawyers,'' Ramirez said.

U.S. OPPOSITION TO THAI CANDIDATE FOR WTO DRAWS RESENTMENT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ Protesters shouted at the gates of the U.S.
Embassy Friday, voicing a growing wave of anger here that was
summed up the other day by Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai: Something
fishy is going on.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly out of nowhere, a surge of anti-Americanism has
gripped some Thais over the opposition by Washington to the
candidacy of Supachai Panitchpakdi, a deputy prime minister and
commerce minister, to lead the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Public figures have been announcing that they will boycott the
Fourth of July reception at the embassy. In addition, a number of
leading politicians have called for a reassessment of Thailand's
friendly ties with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Supachai, 52, has been on the front lines of the struggle for
economic revival by Thailand, the birthplace of the Asian financial
crisis nearly two years ago. He is a finalist to become the new
director general of the trade organization, the 134-nation group
that makes the rules of global trade, and he is widely viewed as a
voice for Asia and developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   But an opposing camp, led by the United States, has coalesced
around the candidacy of Mike Moore, the former prime minister of
New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations to pick one of them have been deadlocked in heated
debate at the trade organization's Geneva headquarters since last
Saturday, when the four-year term of the incumbent director
general, Renato Ruggiero of Italy, expired.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of a leader at the organization is imperiling a new
round of trade talks scheduled to start Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``This institution will stop,'' said Rita Hayes, the American
representative in Geneva. ``It will completely stop until we have a
new director general.''
</P>
<P>
   An attempt last week by Ali Mchumo, chairman of the
organization's General Council, to break the impasse seems only to
have inflamed Supachai's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Mchumo said he had determined that Moore had the support of 62
countries, versus 59 for Supachai, and that therefore Supachai
should quit the race. Mchumo's calculation did not take into
account 13 countries whose preferences were not determined.
</P>
<P>
   Thai officials were outraged, and said the United States was
responsible for what they called a conspiracy against their
candidate. Calls for retaliation intensified.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson of the WTO selection is that it's time we reviewed
our foreign policy with all countries, especially the United
States, which say that they are our true friends,'' said the senate
speaker, Meechai Ruchupan, this week. ``We have to see who are our
real friends and who are our real enemies. In the present world
every country must have claws of its own, and that's not just in
terms of arms but also strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Noppadol Pattama, a member of Parliament's committee on foreign
affairs, went a step further, saying, ``We might need to turn more
to the European Union, Japan and China, which will increase our
balance of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Chuan alluded to a ``dirty tricks'' campaign against the
Thai candidate and said there was ``something fishy going on'' in
the selection process.
</P>
<P>
   This was a reference to a widespread sense here that Washington
had been orchestrating an undeclared backstage campaign to
undermine Thai interests. Officials here say the United States,
despite its denials, has exercised a ``secret veto'' against
Supachai, whom Washington might regard as insufficiently committed
to free trade.
</P>
<P>
   In a front-page editorial, the English-language daily The Nation
crystallized the resentment. The editorial accused the United
States of ``betting on Moore's candidacy to fulfill its
hegemonistic aspiration after having flexed its muscles in other
world organizations like the United Nations, World Bank and
International Monetary Fund.''
</P>
<P>
   After the crash of the Thai currency, the baht, in July 1997,
the IMF produced a $17 billion rescue package for Thailand that
like the packages for other nations has resulted in painful
economic austerity. Critics here have complained that these new
economic policies have sacrificed the welfare of ordinary people to
that of the banks.
</P>
<P>
   The critics also have complained that the United States only
offered limited aid of its own to Thailand, particularly in the
early stages of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different strands intertwined together,'' said Ji
Ungpakorn, a political scientist at Chulalongkorn University.
``It's the IMF involvement in the economy and also the move to
privatize state industries that have set off a nationalistic
response. That's starting to cause a current of anti-Americanism.''

`HUNT FOR THE UNICORN KILLER': UNSUCCESSFUL RETELLING OF TRAGIC
TALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Hunt for the Unicorn Killer'' distills real events into a
grim inversion of ``Beauty and the Beast.'' This time, even
unconditional love cannot transform the beast's dark soul. Just as
sadly, the filmmakers' unconditional effort cannot overcome the
limitations imposed by both the source material and the
inflexibility of the network movie form.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the gap between the two parts of this NBC
mini-series is far more than 24 hours. The drama begins Sunday
night by offering memorably drawn characters. But the most
compelling among them, the tragic beauty, must die just before the
11 o'clock news. And viewers who return for Monday night's
conclusion are in for a letdown as the story drifts on for the
requisite two more hours.
</P>
<P>
   That said, it must be quickly added that the film displays some
first-rate work: by the director, William A. Graham; the writer,
Bruce Graham (they're not related), and a cast that includes Tom
Skerritt and Naomi Watts. They all keep a complicated and often
bleak story moving forward, engaging both the mind and the heart.
</P>
<P>
   The facts of that story are well known. Holly Maddux (played by
Ms. Watts), a bright, rebellious Bryn Mawr College graduate from
Tyler, Texas, vanished in 1977. The disappearance solidified her
conservative family's deep distrust of Ira Einhorn (Kevin
Anderson), the counterculture activist with whom Holly had lived in
Philadelphia for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Holly had told her sister Meg (Kellie Overbey) that she was
planning to leave Einhorn. But his carefully tended reputation as a
guru of nonviolence helped shield him from suspicion until 1979,
when an investigator hired by Holly's father, Fred Maddux (
Skerritt), persuaded the Philadelphia authorities to search
Einhorn's apartment. The police found Holly's body there, locked in
a trunk.
</P>
<P>
   Charged with murder, Einhorn maintained his innocence, blaming a
nutty-sounding government conspiracy aimed at discrediting him.
Awaiting trial, he was freed on bail and fled the country. In 1993
he was convicted in absentia and sentenced to life. He remains in
France and continues to fight extradition.
</P>
<P>
   The script compresses and rearranges some of the details but
stays within sight of the facts as laid out in the book ``The
Unicorn's Secret,'' by Steven Levy, a writer and editor at
Newsweek. Einhorn, whose name means one horn in German, sometimes
referred to himself as the Unicorn. The television people
needlessly inflated the book's title; only a small part of the film
depicts the hunt for Einhorn after he went on the lam.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's Holly and Ira are painted as polar opposites. She
glows with life (and an unlikely shade of platinum-blond hair). Her
eyes sparkle with intelligence, but they cannot see through this
dark, hairy boor. As he seduces her, he boasts that being so famous
aids his work. ``What  &UR; is  &LR; your work?'' she asks. ``Enlightening
the planet,'' he announces.
</P>
<P>
   Conceptually, this Ira is a problem. Although you are told that
he is widely respected by rich industrialists, top universities and
even senior police officials as well as some leftover hippies, all
you ever  &UR; see &LR;  is a self-important jerk. The film, made with the
blessing of the Maddux family and the man who prosecuted the murder
case, is quite emphatic on this point. Anderson, appearing in
``Death of a Salesman'' on Broadway, is not permitted to find any
hints of goodness in his beast. That may make for accurate
reporting and for a kind of justice by television, but it stifles
the drama.
</P>
<P>
   The other cast members are given more room to maneuver, and they
use it to good advantage. Ms. Watts is a sympathetic Holly.
Skerritt, in another variation on the craggy, loving father, totes
his pain believably.
</P>
<P>
   A number of the supporting players hit just the right notes of
humanity, among them Ms. Overbey, whose character grows up in the
story's margins; Ruben Santiago-Hudson as a police detective, and
Martin Donovan as the prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Their work is hardly in vain. But having chosen to lavish such
obvious effort on a tale that still sadly has no end and having to
let that tale unfold in precisely timed network morsels, the
storytellers are ultimately defeated.

HOW MUCH PROTECTION FOR BANK CUSTOMERS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, May 9)  
(mk) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Your bank can collect details about your spending habits, like
how much you charged last year at lingerie, liquor and
lawn-and-garden stores, and then sell that information to companies
that market bras, booze and bug killers.
</P>
<P>
   And your bank is not required to tell you if it does. Nor can
you do anything about it, except maybe pay for everything with cash
(in which case your bank can collect and sell data on your ATM use
patterns).
</P>
<P>
   Last week, President Clinton pressed for tougher laws to curb or
at least improve disclosure of what he called banking industry
abuses like these. Consumer advocates say, however, that with the
government unlikely to afford adequate protections, bank customers
must be wary.
</P>
<P>
   The president wants to have banks improve disclosure of fees,
charges and interest rates. Consumer groups say that bank customers
shouldn't have to be corporate lawyers or accountants to comprehend
what their banks are offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people in this country are essentially math-illiterate,
and they need information disclosed in terms that they can
understand but that Congress is not requiring,'' said Gary Klein of
the Consumer Law Center in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants credit card issuers who lure customers with low
teaser rates to state prominently how much they charge after the
introductory periods _ in some cases, more than 2 percent a month.
For now, customers should concentrate not on the initial rates,
often promoted even on the envelopes containing these offers, but
on the regular rates, sometimes disclosed in small print and
sometimes not at all.
</P>
<P>
   Automated teller machines present special challenges. People who
use ATMs operated by banks where they do not have accounts often
have to go through several steps to learn whether and what they
will be charged. Last week, the Senate approved a requirement that
banks post charges on the machines.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the president's proposals are meant to protect
customers' privacy. Mary Griffin, a lawyer for Consumers Union, the
nonprofit publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, wants Congress,
at a minimum, to require full disclosure in plain English when
banks sell information about their customers and their spending
habits. Better yet, she said, customers should be able to block the
sharing or sale of this information, as Clinton has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Senate, which last week passed a bill that would
repeal the core laws that have governed the banking industry since
the Depression, the focus was much less on protecting consumers
than on letting banks, insurers and securities firms enter one
another's businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The president says that as banks expand their domains, there is
greater need for new restrictions and privacy protections. When one
company can own a bank, an insurance company and a brokerage firm,
he said last week, ``you should not have to worry that the results
of your latest physical will be used to deny your application for a
mortgage or a credit card.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates also want Congress to prohibit banks from
pitching insurance and investment products to people with pending
loan applications, a practice they regard as coercive. Banks aren't
allowed to turn down loan applicants for refusing to buy other
products, but those seeking loans often have the opposite
impression. Consumer advocates advise applicants to get their loans
first, then choose insurance and investments separately and free
from untoward pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer groups say the president should have tried to give
customers who buy securities from banks at least as many rights as
those who buy from brokers. Most important, they say, are
protections against being steered into unsuitable investments, like
an especially volatile mutual fund or Internet stocks for an
elderly widower with only modest savings.
</P>
<P>
   Also missing from the president's proposals are limits on the
rates banks can charge on loans or credit cards, consumer groups
say. States used to set limits, but Congress, with the backing of
the Supreme Court, has asserted its dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Banks say the loosening of restrictions benefits many customers,
because interest rates can be set according to each borrower's
credit risk. While some people pay higher rates because of poor
credit histories, the banks say, others now borrow at lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   But with credit card lenders having to write off only 1 percent
of the money owed them, Klein said, punitive rates are not
justified.
</P>
<P>
   While the president is threatening to veto the Senate bill for
weakening regulations aimed at making sure banks lend in the inner
cities, he has not listed the other consumer issues as veto bait.
</P>
<P>
   Banking trade groups say that issues as complex as privacy and
disclosure should be dealt with separately, rather than having them
jeopardize legislation needed now. ``These consumer protection
issues,'' said Ed Yingling, chief lobbyist for the American Bankers
Association, ``are not germaine to the bill.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer
Federation of America, said that the longer the delays, the greater
the need to police bank practices. ``Banks are pushing the envelope
in every direction, testing consumers and regulators,'' he said.
``And why? Because their consumer business is far and away their
most profitable business.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 9)  
 (af)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   No party lasts a lifetime, but since early November investors in
technology shares of a variety of stripes have been in full boogie
mode.
</P>
<P>
   From a 52-week low on Nov. 6 until April 9, its most recent
peak, Morgan Stanley's High-Tech 35 Index gained more than 64
percent; many Internet stocks performed far better. The index has
since cooled a bit, as money has moved into more staid _ and
cheaper _ cyclicals.
</P>
<P>
   Still, through Friday, the index remained 47 percent above its
November low. And Morgan Stanley's on-line brokerage unit is still
running television ads of adolescents with their own helicopters
and tow-truck operators who own islands. Or is it countries? The
ads don't seem to be aimed at those who buy stocks for the dividend
checks.
</P>
<P>
   Charles A. Morris, who has managed the $5.8 billion T. Rowe
Price Science and Technology fund since 1991, took some time last
week to talk about the sector and the possibility of a tech wreck. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)People have been talking about a major correction in
technology for some time. Is what we are seeing now the start of
that, or is it the beginning of something else?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think the rotation we are seeing indicates an end to
the technology cycle, because technology reinvents itself every
decade.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s, it was automation of the back office and
deployment of mainframe and minicomputers. In the 1990s, it has
been personal computers and cellular. Now, the industry is
reinventing itself to Internet-work computing. Since these things
tend to run in 10-year waves, arguably this particular cycle is
just beginning. The real question is what happens over the very
near term, because we have come a little too far, too fast.
</P>
<P>
   Technology funds are about 100 percent off the lows established
last fall. Over the last 12 to 15 years it hasn't gotten much
better than that without a correction of around 15 percent. That
thins out the herd and sets the stage for the next leg up.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, tech stocks tend to do better in the fall and
winter months than they do between April Fool's Day and Halloween.
And Y2K is another complicating factor, because it may lead to a
slowdown in spending in summer and early fall. Lastly, you have to
look at some of the froth in the market, most specifically in the
Internet sector.
</P>
<P>
   So all of that has to give you pause over the next three to six
months. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)What about Internet stocks? Aren't they likely be
the hardest hit in the sector?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You are already seeing signs that the Internet market is
starting to tire. Amazon.com made a series of announcements
recently that three months ago would have sent its stock up 30
percent. This time, the stock fell.
</P>
<P>
   You have seen some initial public offerings that have been
mediocre performers. Indeed, Comps.com, which was priced on
Tuesday, finished below the offering price when it traded on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   If you can get a meaningful correction of 30 percent to 50
percent across the Internet space, the market capitalization of
these stocks will start to represent economic reality and encourage
institutional ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three years, the median return for the Internet
group is going to be negative. But a small minority of those stocks
will put up terrific valuations that make today's valuations look
low. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)What is a realistic way to value Internet companies
that have no earnings?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Wall Street has everyone fixated on a ratio of price to
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't like that, and for the last six weeks we have been
using what we think is a more practical valuation method, which
starts with the multiple of revenues relative to a company's market
capitalization. Once you get that number, then divide it by the
target net margin a company aspires to in the future. This method
allows you to compare stocks within the Internet stocks as well as
to more traditional companies. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)How much of an individual's portfolio should be
invested in this sector?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. People should have anywhere from 5 percent to 15 percent of
their financial assets in this class. The more money they have to
lose, the greater the percentage can be. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Have you been raising cash in anticipation of a
blowoff?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Typically, between 3 percent and 7 percent of our fund's
assets are in cash. Right now we are on the high side. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Which stocks do you like?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We run a fairly balanced portfolio by sector. Five sectors
comprise 80 percent of the fund's assets: software, communications
equipment and services, hardware, semiconductors and information
services.
</P>
<P>
   Our three largest positions are PSInet, a business Internet
service provider, America Online and Softbank, which I think of as
a closed-end mutual fund for Internet holdings. Our favorite holds
include MCI Worldcom, Airtouch Communications, Xilinx, Adobe
Systems, Ascend and Cisco.

 &HT;    AT&AMP;T DEALS STIR DEBATE OVER TELECOMMUNICATIONS
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington categories
 &HT;    For use Saturday, May 8, or Sunday, May 9
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- The strategy behind a bold streak of deal-making
by AT&AMP;T, the nation's largest long-distance telephone company, is
simple to grasp: Deliver to millions of consumers an integrated
bundle of cable TV, high-speed Internet access and local and
wireless phone services.
</P>
<P>
   But before AT&AMP;T redraws the road maps to cyberspace, Congress,
federal agencies, advocacy groups, business rivals, and many
communities with affected franchises will seek to alter the
company's vision of how digital communications should evolve.
</P>
<P>
   Some insights into how the proposed merger of AT&AMP;T and MediaOne
Group, the third-largest U.S. cable company, will play out in
Washington may be seen early next month when the Senate antitrust
subcommittee holds a hearing on the $58 billion deal.
</P>
<P>
   While the panel lacks the clout to reopen the 1996
Telecommunications Act, which was brokered only after a 14-year
struggle, it promises to offer a high-profile forum for the key
parties to voice their views.
</P>
<P>
   The hearings are likely to sound a bipartisan tone. That was
evident Thursday when panel chairman Mike DeWine, (R-Ohio), and
Herb Kohl of Wisconsin, the panel's ranking Democrat, jointly said:
</P>
<P>
   ``While this deal will likely increase AT&AMP;T's ability to provide
competitive local phone service to residential customers -- which
we certainly support -- the jury is still out on how it will affect
the cable/video market. We need to closely examine all competitive
aspects of this proposal to ensure competition is preserved and
consumers are protected.''
</P>
<P>
   Champions of the merger are expected to argue it will promote
dynamic competition in local-phone markets -- virtual monopolies
long controlled by an ever-shrinking number of Baby Bells and GTE,
whose own $53 billion purchase by Bell Atlantic was cleared by the
Justice Department Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole purpose of AT&AMP;T's strategy is to deliver this new
digital world,'' C. Michael Armstrong, the company's chief
executive officer, told financial analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, before the long-distance phone giant can turn
itself into the nation's largest cable operator, with access to 18
of the nation's top 20 markets, it must submit to extensive reviews
by both government antitrust authorities and the Federal
Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a complex transaction,'' FCC Chairman William Kennard
said Friday. ``Because of its size and reach and the many novel
legal and policy issues involved, this proposed merger warrants
very careful scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennard's cautious remarks contrasted sharply with his quick
embrace last year of AT&AMP;T's initial cable deal, its $48 billion
purchase of Tele-Communications Inc., then the No. 2 cable-TV
operator.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC holds the power to block mergers or impose conditions
should it find the planned deal could injure consumers, imperil the
financial health of other players in the telecommunications
industry or otherwise harm the public interest.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is also quite likely to examine another
aspect of the proposed deal: AT&AMP;T's announcement that Microsoft, in
return for a $5 billion cash investment, will supply the software
for up to 10 million TV-set devices that will power the former's
new cable services.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has been in the department's legal gun sights for
years. At an antitrust trial due to resume later this month,
government lawyers have argued that the software giant has sought
to extend its huge market power over personal computers to the
Internet and other emerging domains, like the ones that AT&AMP;T wants
to carve out. For its part, AT&AMP;T says it will also offer other
operating systems in its set-top machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we're headed is toward a new oligopoly,'' said Mark
Cooper, research director for Consumers Union, a Washington
advocacy group that strongly opposes the AT&AMP;T deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, we'll be left with something like a Ma Bell East
and a Ma Bell West and a Ma Bell Cable. The sad part is that the
Clinton administration, by approving the early concentration of the
Baby Bells, has no intellectual leverage left to stop it,'' he
added
</P>
<P>
   The Baby Bells, which need to match AT&AMP;T's torrid pace in
rolling out video services and other high-speed technology, may
seek regulatory relief or court rulings to right what they regard
as a tilted playing field.
</P>
<P>
   While no slouches when it comes to engaging merger-mania, the
regional giants claim they have to jump through too many regulatory
hoops to compete with AT&AMP;T in its core long-distance business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's grossly unfair,'' Edward Whitacre Jr., the chief
executive officer of SBC Communications, told Business Week.
``They're just running around gobbling up companies. We are being
held to a terrible double standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress could conceivably step in to protect such potential
losers as America Online, the nation's biggest Internet service
provider. Should America Online fail to match AT&AMP;T and its newly
won partners in offering fast online access, it could lose some of
its current 17 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to that issue Thursday, two Virginia congressmen,
Republican Bob Goodlatte and Democrat Rick Boucher, sponsored a
bill that would make it easier for America Online gain access to
AT&AMP;T fast cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   Their Internet Freedom Act, which enjoyed wide support in the
prior (CQ)Congress, would make cable companies liable under
antitrust law if they block competing Internet providers from
getting access to their wires.
</P>
<P>
   If the bill becomes law, and if AT&AMP;T denied America Online
access, the latter could take Ma Bell to court.
</P>
<P>
   ``There weren't reasonable grounds before to sue,'' said Justin
Newton, public policy director of the Internet Service Providers
Consortium.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginians' bill would also let local phone companies enter
the market for heavy-duty ``backbone'' Internet services, which
could further lower prices for wholesale cyberspace facilities.

 &HT;    AT&AMP;T DEALS STIR DEBATE OVER TELECOMMUNICATIONS
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington categories
 &HT;    For use Saturday, May 8, or Sunday, May 9
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- The strategy behind a bold streak of deal-making
by AT&AMP;T, the nation's largest long-distance telephone company, is
simple to grasp: Deliver to millions of consumers an integrated
bundle of cable TV, high-speed Internet access and local and
wireless phone services.
</P>
<P>
   But before AT&AMP;T redraws the road maps to cyberspace, Congress,
federal agencies, advocacy groups, business rivals, and many
communities with affected franchises will seek to alter the
company's vision of how digital communications should evolve.
</P>
<P>
   Some insights into how the proposed merger of AT&AMP;T and MediaOne
Group, the third-largest U.S. cable company, will play out in
Washington may be seen early next month when the Senate antitrust
subcommittee holds a hearing on the $58 billion deal.
</P>
<P>
   While the panel lacks the clout to reopen the 1996
Telecommunications Act, which was brokered only after a 14-year
struggle, it promises to offer a high-profile forum for the key
parties to voice their views.
</P>
<P>
   The hearings are likely to sound a bipartisan tone. That was
evident Thursday when panel chairman Mike DeWine, (R-Ohio), and
Herb Kohl of Wisconsin, the panel's ranking Democrat, jointly said:
</P>
<P>
   ``While this deal will likely increase AT&AMP;T's ability to provide
competitive local phone service to residential customers -- which
we certainly support -- the jury is still out on how it will affect
the cable/video market. We need to closely examine all competitive
aspects of this proposal to ensure competition is preserved and
consumers are protected.''
</P>
<P>
   Champions of the merger are expected to argue it will promote
dynamic competition in local-phone markets -- virtual monopolies
long controlled by an ever-shrinking number of Baby Bells and GTE,
whose own $53 billion purchase by Bell Atlantic was cleared by the
Justice Department Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole purpose of AT&AMP;T's strategy is to deliver this new
digital world,'' C. Michael Armstrong, the company's chief
executive officer, told financial analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, before the long-distance phone giant can turn
itself into the nation's largest cable operator, with access to 18
of the nation's top 20 markets, it must submit to extensive reviews
by both government antitrust authorities and the Federal
Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a complex transaction,'' FCC Chairman William Kennard
said Friday. ``Because of its size and reach and the many novel
legal and policy issues involved, this proposed merger warrants
very careful scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennard's cautious remarks contrasted sharply with his quick
embrace last year of AT&AMP;T's initial cable deal, its $48 billion
purchase of Tele-Communications Inc., then the No. 2 cable-TV
operator.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC holds the power to block mergers or impose conditions
should it find the planned deal could injure consumers, imperil the
financial health of other players in the telecommunications
industry or otherwise harm the public interest.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is also quite likely to examine another
aspect of the proposed deal: AT&AMP;T's announcement that Microsoft, in
return for a $5 billion cash investment, will supply the software
for up to 10 million TV-set devices that will power the former's
new cable services.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has been in the department's legal gun sights for
years. At an antitrust trial due to resume later this month,
government lawyers have argued that the software giant has sought
to extend its huge market power over personal computers to the
Internet and other emerging domains, like the ones that AT&AMP;T wants
to carve out. For its part, AT&AMP;T says it will also offer other
operating systems in its set-top machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we're headed is toward a new oligopoly,'' said Mark
Cooper, research director for Consumers Union, a Washington
advocacy group that strongly opposes the AT&AMP;T deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, we'll be left with something like a Ma Bell East
and a Ma Bell West and a Ma Bell Cable. The sad part is that the
Clinton administration, by approving the early concentration of the
Baby Bells, has no intellectual leverage left to stop it,'' he
added
</P>
<P>
   The Baby Bells, which need to match AT&AMP;T's torrid pace in
rolling out video services and other high-speed technology, may
seek regulatory relief or court rulings to right what they regard
as a tilted playing field.
</P>
<P>
   While no slouches when it comes to engaging merger-mania, the
regional giants claim they have to jump through too many regulatory
hoops to compete with AT&AMP;T in its core long-distance business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's grossly unfair,'' Edward Whitacre Jr., the chief
executive officer of SBC Communications, told Business Week.
``They're just running around gobbling up companies. We are being
held to a terrible double standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress could conceivably step in to protect such potential
losers as America Online, the nation's biggest Internet service
provider. Should America Online fail to match AT&AMP;T and its newly
won partners in offering fast online access, it could lose some of
its current 17 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to that issue Thursday, two Virginia congressmen,
Republican Bob Goodlatte and Democrat Rick Boucher, sponsored a
bill that would make it easier for America Online gain access to
AT&AMP;T fast cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   Their Internet Freedom Act, which enjoyed wide support in the
prior (CQ)Congress, would make cable companies liable under
antitrust law if they block competing Internet providers from
getting access to their wires.
</P>
<P>
   If the bill becomes law, and if AT&AMP;T denied America Online
access, the latter could take Ma Bell to court.
</P>
<P>
   ``There weren't reasonable grounds before to sue,'' said Justin
Newton, public policy director of the Internet Service Providers
Consortium.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginians' bill would also let local phone companies enter
the market for heavy-duty ``backbone'' Internet services, which
could further lower prices for wholesale cyberspace facilities.

SENATOR SAYS REGULATORS TO PROBE WEST COAST GAS PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Calling it the strongest response yet to her
quest for lower gas prices on the West Coast, Sen. Barbara Boxer
said the Federal Trade Commission has assured her it is
investigating the recent surge in the cost of gasoline in
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission is thoroughly investigating pricing activities
in those markets to determine whether recent increases were in
whole or in part the result of anticompetitive conduct,'' said FTC
Chairman Robert Pitofsky in a letter to the California Democrat
dated May 4.
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky said he could not comment on the details of the
investigation, but he confirmed that staff members were examining
the impact that two proposed mergers _ Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp.,
and BP/Amoco PLC with Atlantic Richfield Co. _ could have on
competition in the industry, particularly in California where gas
demand and prices are high.
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky is being helped by attorneys general in 21 states,
including California's Bill Lockyer.
</P>
<P>
   The federal agency is ``mindful of ARCO's importance in
California,'' Pitofsky wrote, ``and expect that our investigation
will pay particular attention to the potential impact of the
transaction on retail gasoline prices and other aspects of
competition in California and other western states.''
</P>
<P>
   While the response may seem guarded, Boxer said it ended the
``deafening silence'' she has received from the FTC.
</P>
<P>
   ``This letter has given me tremendous assurance,'' she said. ``I
look at it, frankly, as a breakthrough. Up to this point, we were
not able to get anything back from the FTC other than some vague
oral statements.''
</P>
<P>
   California drivers are paying as much as $2 a gallon for premium
gasoline in some spots.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer asked the FTC a year ago for investigation into why gas
prices in California, particularly in the San Francisco and San
Diego areas, were so much higher than in the rest of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In March, when prices skyrocketed as much as 50 percent in the
San Francisco area, Boxer asked the FTC to require gas companies
seeking merger approval to reserve a portion of their fuel to sell
to independent marketers and refineries at fair market prices.
</P>
<P>
   The independents are not affiliated with major oil companies, so
they are free to buy from any source. They often buy excess gas
from the big companies at a discount and pass the savings on to
customers.
</P>
<P>
   In Pitofsky's letter, he noted that sources of supply to
independent gas stations have been an antitrust concern for many
years. He pointed out a 1981 Court of Appeals decision in which the
court upheld a ruling blocking the merger of Marathon Oil Co. with
Mobil, based partly on the potential for less gas being available
to the independent sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer took that citation as a positive sign: ``I was glad that
he seems to feel, without directly saying so, that aspect _ giving
a sure supply to the independents _ is important.''
</P>
<P>
   Anita Mangeles, spokeswoman for the Western States Petroleum
Association, wasn't fazed by the FTC's response. ``This is nothing
new. Senator Boxer requested this investigation about a year ago,
and it's still ongoing,'' said Mangeles, whose group represents the
major Western oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   Mangeles said she expected the investigation, both into prices
as well as the mergers, to reveal no evidence of wrongdoing. She
said the FTC investigators ``look at big mergers no matter what the
industry is.''
</P>
<P>
   The gas industry has maintained that recent refinery accidents
in California, combined with an increase in crude oil prices, are
to blame for the rising prices. Prices also typically increase in
spring to take advantage of holiday travelers. Finally, the state's
high taxes and requirements for cleaner burning gas add to the
price tag.

 &HT;    Traditional black preaching draws forth two-way communication
between pew and pulpit
 &HT;    By Maria Mallory
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Adorned in a flowing robe, the Rev. James Davis rises
from his seat in the pulpit of the historic Big Bethel African
Methodist Episcopal Church. There's a tension in the air. Members,
filing one by one from their seats, had taken turns at the altar
rail for individual prayer, while a soloist crooned a song in
tribute to the faith in God that she learned from her grandmother:
</P>
<P>
   ``He walks with me, and he talks with me, and he tells me I am
his own. And the joy we share as we tarry there, none other has
ever known.''
</P>
<P>
   As the song ends, Davis positions himself behind the carved
mahogany lectern on the pulpit. Emotions are still running high, as
shouts of joy and grateful ``hallelujahs!'' echo across the
sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   In the front pew, Monica Johnson is moved close to tears by the
soloist's song. ``It was like everybody in here who had that kind
of connection with their grandmother, we were just drawn in,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis bows his head and begins to pray. ``As this word is
delivered, so fill it with power that it might go forth and fall on
fertile ground. . . .'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the people of God said in agreement . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . Amen!'' worshippers respond.
</P>
<P>
   Davis then instructs the congregation to turn in their Bibles
with him ``for these next few moments'' to the 11th chapter of
John. ``When you get it, let me know,'' he instructs, listening as
the voices chime in, one by one: ``Got it!''
</P>
<P>
   The sound of turning Bible pages flutters across the church like
the rustling wings of a flock of birds preparing for flight.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows the pastor's sermon will last more than a ``few
moments.'' And though Davis has taken the ecclesiastical spotlight
at this point in the service, his sermon will be no monologue.
</P>
<P>
   In the unique cultural tradition of black worship, preaching is
a group exercise led by the minister, who serves as a sort of
homiletic host, setting a Bible-based buffet of teaching and
inspiration, while inviting the congregation to partake without
inhibition. A mix of spirituality, image-rich rhetoric and verbal
calisthenics, traditional black preaching is a performance art form
deeply rooted in Christian Gospel and African religious tradition.
Unlike the sermon-as-lecture approach, crowd participation is an
integral part of preaching in the black church.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I like about it is you don't have to be an usher, in the
choir or on the ministerial staff'' to participate in the service,
explains Chris Parker, who has been a member of Bethel since 1996.
``It's an inclusive worship experience.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not for everyone. Some feel the boisterous
call-and-response experience that characterizes the traditional
black church service is less than dignified, and others simply
prefer a more sedate style of worship.
</P>
<P>
   More than 70 years ago, writer-activist James Weldon Johnson
worried that a lack of appreciation for traditional culture would
spell the death of black preaching. Johnson created a literary
tribute to the folk sermons that were the staple of the preachers
of his day. He wrote ``God's Trombones: Seven Negro Sermons in
Verse'' (Viking Penguin, $8.95, 64 pages) in the style of the
poetic prose and spirit-filled oratory of traditional black
preaching. ``The old-time Negro preacher is rapidly passing,''
Johnson wrote in the preface of the book, published in 1927. ``I
have here tried sincerely to fix something of him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson's warnings were evidently premature, judging by the
number of black churches embracing the tradition today. In Atlanta,
congregations showcasing such traditional preaching include Antioch
Baptist Church North, Ben Hill United Methodist Church, Ray of Hope
Christian Church, and others spanning the denominational spectrum
from Methodist to Baptist, Pentecostal to nondenominational.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, much has changed since Johnson first penned his
pessimistic prediction. Two members of a troupe that recently
presented dramatic readings of Johnson's sermons at Emory
University were women. ``Negroes'' no more, many modern-day
ministers hold credentials never dreamed of by Johnson. A
fifth-generation preacher, Bethel's Davis, 44, is a good example.
</P>
<P>
   The first in his familial line of preachers to attend college,
in 1985 Davis earned a doctorate of ministry at Atlanta's
Interdenominational Theological Center, which graduates 80 to 90
students each year, including one of every 10 black students
enrolled in a master of divinity program at accredited Association
of Theological Schools. In 1997, 5,800 African-Americans were
enrolled in U.S. and Canadian seminaries, according to data
collected by the association.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as Davis also demonstrates, the art of traditional black
preaching remains very much alive. ``There has been no significant
change in two centuries in the best of black preaching,'' says ITC
homiletics professor Henry Mitchell in his book ``Black Preaching:
The Recovery of a Powerful Art'' (Abingdon Press, $16, 143 pages).
</P>
<P>
   Black preaching translates the message of the Gospel to address
the peculiar needs of an isolated people, says Mitchell. This is
the enduring legacy of so-called ``old-time religion,'' which is
both the heart of Johnson's writings and the soul of traditional
black preaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's crucial about black preaching . . . is that there's
nothing new under the sun,'' says Teresa Fry Brown, assistant
professor of homiletics at Emory's Candler School of Theology, who
was part of the performing group at Emory. ``The God spoken about
then is the same God we know now.''
</P>
<P>
   Big Bethel, established 151 years ago, is the oldest black
congregation in Atlanta and is home to a well-educated, socially
and politically prominent membership. Members clearly revel in the
religious traditions of their parents, grandparents and bygone
generations.
</P>
<P>
   The style and substance of Davis' preaching echo a past that is
still very much a part of the community identity. ``He allows me to
come home, so to speak,'' says parishioner Carl Powell, who was
reared in rural Mississippi. ``He's got relevant stuff that speaks
to where I am now as an educated professional,'' with sermons that
``relate to where we were, where we are, and where we're going.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like you're always on edge because you're waiting on your
opportunity to respond,'' adds Parker. His sermon ``will stimulate
something in your spirit that will make you respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis' delivery of a sermon on a recent Sunday, ``Valuing the
Devalued,'' is based on the biblical account of Lazarus' death. In
the gospel according to Davis, Jesus' friends, Martha and Mary, are
``making a mean table when Jesus came over.'' A smiling parishioner
waves his hand, ``Go 'head!''
</P>
<P>
   The message, as always, begins with the Bible. After reading the
Scripture aloud, Davis relates the biblical account of Lazarus'
resurrection and updates the narrative. ``The folk weren't worried
about Lazarus when he was alive. When Lazarus died, that's when
Lazarus sho 'nuff took on his thing. You see, Jesus had dealt with
the resurrection of folk before, but there was always a speculation
as to whether or not they were really dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know that sistah that Jesus got to, she had died, and
everybody was around there talking about her being dead. But then
somebody, somebody _ who may have been a member of Bethel back then
_ somebody got into the midst of the conversation and said, `Now,
she wasn't really dead. I mean, she was just comatose. She was in a
deep coma, and she wasn't really dead.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And, as the congregation responds with laughter, Davis chides,
``Y'all need to stop talking about miracles (as if) it wasn't
really a miracle, `It was just that she had gone into a coma'!''
</P>
<P>
   Through the course of the sermon, Davis' voice is at times raspy
and booming, at times tender and soft, at times playfully
stuttering. He uses repetition for emphasis, often repeating a
phrase, constructing a rhetorical refrain that punctuates a rhythm
that builds to a boisterous climax.
</P>
<P>
   Starting slowly, Davis intones, ``This, this is what he did: He,
he, he, he was the key, Lazarus was _ with his dead self _ that
dead Lazarus.'' His voice rises and gains volume and pitch as he
states, ``And you know what made him the right witness? Not only
was he dead, but he was stinky!''
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, again, ``He had been dead so long until the Word says,
`He stinketh.' And, if that wasn't bad enough, he was not only
dead, stinking, but he was buried! He was dead, stinky and buried _
and believe it or not _ thank God for some dead, stinky folk right
now. Yea, yea, yea!''
</P>
<P>
   And with a full-throated shout, Davis exclaims: ``The only
reason the church is in business today is because of dead, stinky
folk _ and I'm one of 'em! If it weren't for dead, stinky folk, the
church wouldn't have a reason to exist. Huh?!! But thank God that
God knows how to bring value out of dead, stinky folk!''
</P>
<P>
   After Lazarus is brought back to life, the way Davis describes
it, you can almost picture him just outside on the corner of Auburn
and Butler. A rhythmic exchange between the preacher and listeners
ends the sermon. Davis takes a few steps about the pulpit depicting
Lazarus ``walking around there throwing high-fives and talking
about how good Jesus was . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah!'' someone yells from the pews.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . bragging about the fact that `I was dead, but I ain't
dead now!' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody who saw (Lazarus) walking and pimping up and down
the street talking about, `I'm a baaaadddd so-and-so' . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah!''
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . everybody saw him talking about the fact that `my friend
did this for me, my friend Jesus!' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah!''
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you discredit a dead, stinky, buried man walking
around? They could not discredit this dead, stinky, buried man
walking around!''
</P>
<P>
   Emotions hit a fevered pitch and many Bethelites are standing,
clapping and yelling, ``Yea! Preach!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting, he really puts himself in it,'' Monica Johnson
says after the service. ``He's just so real!''
</P>
<P>
   Davis acknowledges this is by design. ``We have so many
different kind of folk among us,'' he says. ``From way back, we had
people who couldn't read. Black preachers had to make sure all
their folk were communicated to. The objective always is to find
something relative and the easiest way to relativity is allegory.
Jesus did it all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   For many, that relativity is evidence of the Holy Spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's led from the (Holy) Spirit, he's going to bring things
from the Word that you can identify with,'' says the Rev. Bessie
Robinson, a member of the Bethel ministerial staff. Davis ``is a
Holy Spirit-led preacher. The Holy Spirit is the one who's
ministering through him, and when the Spirit speaks, it comes forth
with power, and it touches people's hearts . . . and that's when I
get to hollering.''
</P>
<P>
   Even today, effective black preaching ``connects with the inner
being and emotion,'' says Davis. ``The church, the sermon and the
shout was a therapy that we black folk could afford,'' he explains.
``All of that plays together.''

 &HT;    Actors play supporting roles in their `mission' to family, each
other
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, May 9.
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even now, they rarely miss a chance to call each other baby.
They have a knack of smoothly finishing each others' sentences
without interruption. Their body language _ hands patting knees,
stroking shoulders _ resembles that of newlyweds rather than a
husband and wife in their late 40s, married for 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   Meet actors Afemo and Elisabeth Omilami, soulmates of the
Atlanta stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell about those movies you've got coming up, baby,'' says
Elisabeth in the deep, soft coo she uses when her husband is next
to her. ``That's a fine body of work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Omilamis (the name means ``water heals me'' in Yoruba)
rarely get to share a stage. They shuttle from their Atlanta home
to film and TV centers (New York and Wilmington, N.C.,
particularly) to support their children, Awodele, 19, and Juanita,
13. So it's a treat for audiences _ ``paradise for us,'' says Afemo
_ to have these larger-than-life thespians under the same, Alliance
Theatre roof in overlapping plays.
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth, the daughter and longtime political helpmate of Hosea
Williams, is giving the performance of her career as Quilly
McGrath, the crafty, wisecracking, deceptively strong sister in
``The Old Settler,'' a romantic drama on the Alliance mainstage.
Afemo, a key player in establishing Alliance artistic director
Kenny Leon's national reputation in the late '80s and early '90s
(``Miss Evers' Boys,'' ``Joe Turner's Come and Gone''), returns as
a staunch, God-fearing single father in ``Crumbs From the Table of
Joy,'' opening Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Recently they spoke in the Woodruff Arts Center galleria.
</P>
<P>
   Q:How did you meet?
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth: We met in Ted Shine's ``Contributions'' at People's
Survival Theater, (an Atlanta) group I led in the '70s. Afemo was
supposed to be the son and I was supposed to be the grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Q:That's a loaded situation.
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth: Very loaded. But I sure didn't feel like a
grandmother around him (laughs).
</P>
<P>
   Afemo: I wasn't really all that interested romantically at that
time, I think she was more interested in me.
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth: Oh, listen to that now! (Laughs.) I don't believe he
said that.
</P>
<P>
   Afemo: I wasn't ready. . . . I was a bohemian.
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth: Yes, walking up and down the streets with no shoes
on, singing at the top of his voice. But I knew I had him when
there was a blizzard. The snow was over his ankles and here he came
trudging through the snow to see me in my apartment. I said,
``Hmmmm.''
</P>
<P>
   Q:What happens when you don't see eye-to-eye?
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth: I have to defer to him. He's very loving and usually
gives me whatever I want, but it's important that as an
African-American male he be the head of the family and that my son
sees a strong male figure in the home. But he's wise enough to know
that I'm usually right.
</P>
<P>
   Afemo: I'm not one of these controlling husbands. Sometimes she
goes out for a job and I watch the family. We lived in New York for
years, but when our daughter came along, Elisabeth went to see her
mom (in Atlanta) and said, ``I'm not coming back.'' I held on
another six months but finally saw that Atlanta was best for our
family.
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth: Yes, you came back first of '87, baby, same year I
went on the Forsyth (County) march (led by her father, Hosea
Williams). I was the first black woman held in the Forsyth County
jail. My cell was right next to the KKK people, shouting horrible
things to me all night. I never stopped chasing my father, trying
to have a normal father-daughter relationship. The movement often
came between us, so I'd rather be in jail than away from him. Time
is short and family is No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Q:You often mention spiritual life and artistic life in same
breath.
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth: They're one in the same.
</P>
<P>
   Afemo: They go hand in hand. Theater is not a frivolous thing,
it can be as valuable as church. It took a while for me to give up
that ``stardom'' nonsense, for the Lord to burn all that away. I
see now that he gave me this talent so that I could give it back.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What have been your rewarding roles?
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth: He saw ``Old Settler'' in New York and said, ``Baby,
I found . . . the play . . . for you.'' Bluespeak Woman in
``Spunk'' at Jomandi was fun because I got to sing and be funny and
sexy. I love to represent the sensuality and vivacity of the older
African-American woman.
</P>
<P>
   Q:There's so much affection in your Quilly. Is it a tribute to
someone?
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth: I was thinking about Pearl Bailey. My mother (Juanita
Williams), too, she's like 5 feet tall but so full of spunk. My
aunt Sarah Wilson, librarian at (Clark Atlanta University) has that
certain way of firing things off.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Afemo, what about your role in the upcoming ``Crumbs''?
</P>
<P>
   Afemo: It's a fine family story about how society has to
appreciate the little blessings again, the crumbs of life.
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth: It's the little things that kept us alive. Our faith
kept our sanity. It's been a journey of frightening times and just
holding on to each other, encouraging each other. One would be down
and the other would say, ``Come on now, baby, something will come
along.''
</P>
<P>
   Afemo: This business will beat you down if you don't have a firm
foothold, a meaning, a mission.

 &HT;    Laurie Anderson's latest: Multimedia opera
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday May, 9.
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Still looking slightly spooked after all these years,
with the trademark spiky hair she cuts herself, performance artist
Laurie Anderson seems hermetically sealed in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   With the androgynous sensibility of Andy Warhol, the
anesthesia-soaked voice of William S. Burroughs and the eternal
presence of a Mapplethorpe photograph, she remains, at 51, the
queen of the experimental downtown scene she helped define more
than 20 years ago. She is one of the few artists who've stuck
around long enough to become an oxymoron _ having, as The New York
Times recently put it, evolved into the ``mainstream avant-garde.''
</P>
<P>
   On this day, at her Canal Street studio overlooking the Hudson
River, Anderson is wired for sound. Literally.
</P>
<P>
   Drinking coffee, breaking the filters off Marlboros before
lighting them up, she closes a window to drown out the noise of a
jackhammer, then decides later she wants to tape the intriguing
sound. We're here to discuss ``Songs and Stories From Moby Dick,''
the multimedia opera based on the Herman Melville novel. She's
bringing the piece June 3-4 to Spoleto Festival USA in Charleston,
S.C., but before this hour is over, she'll talk about everything
from her father's recent death to the time she taught poetry to
prisoners at Rikers Island.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in red loafers, gray socks, black pants, an orange tank
top and a meshy, chartreuse sweater, she shucks off her stern
demeanor when asked about the time in 1978 that she worked as a
migrant farmer with a family near Covington, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I was a cotton picker,'' she says in a country twang,
smacking her lips and sounding as if she's about to spit chewing
tobacco from her mouth.
</P>
<P>
   She had almost forgotten about her Rikers Island days, she says,
until she happened upon a set of purple notes from an old
mimeograph machine. ``It was a list of things like, `Always
remember your client is mentally ill.' And I thought, `I'm going to
put that on my desk right now, because that's a useful thing to
remember.'''
</P>
<P>
   This is the voice of a woman with a deadpan sense of humor and a
dark sensibility, a person who works with equal success as a visual
artist, filmmaker, poet, spoken-word performer, singer, musician,
stand-up comic and electronics wizard.
</P>
<P>
   Her influence has been profound.
</P>
<P>
   ``She really has changed the history of art in very big ways,''
says Roselee Goldberg, a New York University art professor and
curator who is writing a book on Anderson. ``I've taken the
opportunity to say loud and clear that she's indeed one of our most
important American artists at the end of the 20th century. She's
way up there, along with Warhol and (Robert) Rauschenberg.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Larry Larson, Anderson's company manager for the past two
years: ``I don't know of any other artist who is involved on an
international level with so many different disciplines. We work
with record companies. We work with international presenters. And
at the same time, we meet with the heads of the great museums of
the world. ''
</P>
<P>
   Professionally outgoing by necessity, Anderson is intensely
private. She never brings up the rock singer Lou Reed, for example,
even though he's been her boyfriend for six years. A
black-and-white photo of Reed hangs in the book-filled studio,
which is full of electronic instruments, a telescope pointed toward
the river and a scale model of the ``Moby Dick'' stage.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who grew up in the small town of Glen Ellyn, Ill., in
the 1950s, has always embraced nonconformity and rallied for
individual rights. In 1987 she made a video titled ``Alive From Off
Center.'' In 1980, she performed at the anti-inaugural ball for
Ronald Reagan. The program notes to her 1989 album, ``Strange
Angels,'' contain a poignant letter to her friend Robert
Mapplethorpe, the controversial photographer who died of AIDS that
year. His images of Anderson grace the cover.
</P>
<P>
   After getting degrees in art history and sculpture, and putting
in her years of community service, Anderson launched her career in
1974 with a mixed-media performance art exhibition titled
``As:If.'' She played her trademark violin, which she has studied
since age 5 _ with her feet encased in blocks of ice.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, her eight-hour version of ``United States'' was covered
by Newsweek and Time magazines. ``Big Science,'' the first of her
seven albums, sold 800,000 copies, and ``Strange Angels,'' with its
lush arrangements and conventional verse-chorus structure, signaled
that she had crossed over into the popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   She has given numerous concerts in Atlanta. In 1989, her
much-hyped Spoleto world premiere, ``Empty Places,'' so enraged
festival founder Gian Carlo Menotti that he banned her from the
sister event in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson says she is looking forward to returning to
Charleston with ``Moby Dick.'' She says she enjoys Spoleto
audiences because ``they are up for something different.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People kind of go, `OK, this is an extremely bizarre thing,
and this is a classic.' They aren't afraid to mix 'em up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Moby Dick'' is Anderson's most ambitious work to date and the
culmination of a 25-year obsession with the 1851 novel. It employs
three other actors, countless computers and a new gizmo called the
Talking Stick, which allows performers to manipulate computer
sounds and the sophisticated computer software that controls them.
</P>
<P>
   Something unknowable
</P>
<P>
   As a visual artist, Anderson has had a retrospective at the
Guggenheim Museum in SoHo, and an exhibition is planned for the
Whitney Museum of American Art. In the arcane world of ``Moby
Dick,'' Anderson seems to have found a perfect partner for her free
associational, image-driven narratives and her own bleak worldview.
When a visitor notices a picture of the Dalai Lamai in her
book-filled studio, he asks if she's Buddhist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a seeker,'' she says, turning on the mordant sense of
humor and evading the answer. ``I'm not in anything, although
that's part of my attraction to `Moby Dick,' that I am trying to
find something unknowable. I mean Melville's very funny, but he's
very dark, too. His conclusions, if there are any, are incredibly
bleak. That is, if there is something that created the world, it's
completely mechanical and it's heartless and it will eat you
alive!''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson says she's read the book five times. It's been a
recurring theme in her work since the 1974 film ``Dear Reader.'' On
the 1989 song ``My Eyes'' she crooned:
</P>
<P>
   ``And down in the ocean where nobody goes
</P>
<P>
   ``Some fish are fast, some are slow
</P>
<P>
   ``Some swim round the world, some hide below
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the ocean, so deep, so old.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's two-hour production, says Spoleto director general
Nigel Redden, uses the book as a springboard. ``It will be a
combination of images in a variety of different media,'' he says,
``slides, video and laser, overlaid one on top of another. It's not
going to be a retelling of the Melville novel.''
</P>
<P>
   In exploring the world of Captain Ahab, Anderson echoes the
first line of her first album: ``Good evening, this is your
captain.'' She's always had a thing for airplanes; now she's on a
journey through water and the brain. Asked about the connection,
she says it's all about ``getting out of the box.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm having trouble getting out of the book, because the
book is a kind of box for me. So I've given up on telling the
story.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who has always used technology to illumine the
banalities of modern life (answering machines, plastic surgery) and
to meditate on questions of spirituality, is asked for her thoughts
on angels and the afterlife. ``I think we are the closest to angels
there is _ that's what I think, and I think when you die, you turn
into rain, and then you disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   According to her friends and colleagues, Anderson is as kind as
she is smart. ``First of all, she's just white-hot brilliant,''
says Larson. ``And she is also the kindest major artist I've ever
met, much less worked with. Laurie is up there with, say, Merce
Cunningham and Philip Glass as being a good human being as well as
being a great artist.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, there's a fragile core hidden underneath the
guarded surface. Anderson recently had to interrupt a vacation to
rush to the side of her 88-year-old father, who was dying of
cancer. She said a Buddhist friend coached her on how to ease his
departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I wasn't too irritating. But I did try to help him a
little bit, just by synchronized breathing and trying to make a
situation that wasn't too panicky, to try to encourage him to bring
his energy from the heart up to the top of his head so he could
come out that way. I do believe that is important, that you catch
the part of yourself that is the deepest and let that go, not just
die from your gut but have your heart pass through your head and
then out.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Anderson decides she wants to tape the articulated
sound of the jackhammer outside. She jumps up and goes down into
the bowels of her recording studio for a gigantic tape recorder,
which she clearly has no idea how to operate.
</P>
<P>
   In a moment, she leads her visitor to the elevator. When he
mentions that he might call again with questions about ``Moby
Dick,'' Anderson _ who has been acting a little anxious about not
having an end for the piece _ responds, without skipping a beat,
``And I'll call you if I have any questions about the structure,
too.''

</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Critical response to ``Moby Dick'': After the April 29 world
premiere in Dallas, The Dallas Morning News wrote: ``(The basic
story line from the novel) doesn't begin to explain the
mind-blowing brain candy, visual and aural, that Ms. Anderson
served. . . . Thanks to the nonstop, highly stimulating projection
of backdrops and lights, the show had a dreamy, filmlike, nearly
transcendent quality. When it was over, it was as if the audience
had been on a ship _ for a very long time.''

 &HT;    Breast cancer patients give hope, support to each other
 &HT;    By Derrick Henry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After being diagnosed with breast cancer, Vicki
Castleberry was told she had only six years to live. ``I was
devastated,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen years later, Castleberry, 67, is very much alive. And
she attributes her recovery to finding the right support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew very little about breast cancer, and found out about a
support group through my church,'' says the Tucker (Ga.) resident,
a former interior decorator. ``At that time there were only one or
two cancer support groups in Atlanta, and they were general _ for
all types of cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Castleberry saw a need for a group focused on breast cancer, one
of the most prevalent of all cancers in women. In 1983 she created
such a group, meeting with three other women in her home. Today the
volunteer-run organization, Bosom Buddies of Georgia, includes 35
support groups in 17 Georgia counties and Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   For founder-president Castleberry, the organization has become a
full-time, unpaid job. ``I know I was given a second chance at
life,'' she says. ``This is my way of paying back. I'm here to make
life a little easier for others.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors now recognize the healing power of support groups. A
recent Stanford University study found that women with terminal
breast cancer who had regularly attended support groups lived 18
months longer than patients not attending such groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``By attending support groups, we give hope to one another,''
says Barbara Quinn, 63, a DeKalb County (Ga.) resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not gloom-and-doom meetings. There's a lot of
laughter,'' says the retired insurance adjuster, who stays busy
these days dancing with the Kennesaw Mountain Kloggers, despite
undergoing a double mastectomy in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   'A bright and shining star'
</P>
<P>
   Besides providing emotional support and encouragement, members
of Bosom Buddies share practical information about diet, vitamins,
meditation
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest volunteer needs of the support organization
is for group leaders, or facilitators, who must be breast cancer
survivors who have completed their treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't need to have had breast cancer to volunteer with
Bosom Buddies. The organization needs help at its Chamblee office,
at health fairs, and with the speakers' bureau. Volunteers are also
needed to accompany patients to treatments and doctor's
appointments, to visit patients in hospitals, even to provide
bereavement support to family members.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a ``Stitching Buddies'' program in which volunteers
sew pressure pillows for mastectomy patients and turbans for women
with hair loss caused by chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Guffin of Suwanee (Ga.) was diagnosed with breast cancer
12 years ago. ``It was very, very frightening,'' she says. ``You
don't know if you will live or die, and no one can tell you.'' She
had six rounds of chemotherapy, 35 rounds of radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Getting involved with Bosom Buddies was like seeing ``a bright
and shining star when you are in a deep, dark pit,'' says Guffin.
``You see survivors that look so attractive and good.''
</P>
<P>
   Now a real estate agent, Guffin, 58, worked for 28 years doing
psychiatric social work and drug counseling in Atlanta's inner
city. ``Addicts used to tell me I couldn't help them because I
didn't know what I was talking about. No one in Bosom Buddies can
tell me that,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Guffin's message to breast cancer patients and survivors is
straightforward: ``There is quality life after cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   To volunteer or learn more about the organization, call
770-455-7637.

AIR FORCE USE OF RADIOACTIVE BULLETS REVIVES OLD CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATHLEEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Pentagon has confirmed that the Air Force is
firing radioactive bullets in Yugoslavia, reigniting concerns
raised after the Persian Gulf War about the hazards the ammunition
poses to soldiers, civilians and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   At a Pentagon briefing earlier this week, Maj. Gen. Chuck Wald
said Air Force A-10 ``Warthog'' jets are firing depleted uranium
bullets at Yugoslav tanks.
</P>
<P>
   The ammunition, which was fired for the first time in combat by
U.S. jets and tanks during the 1991 Gulf War, leaves a trail of
contaminated dust and debris on the battlefield. Depleted uranium
is a radioactive metal that is nearly twice as dense as lead.
</P>
<P>
   During the Gulf War, the Pentagon didn't warn American soldiers
about the health risks linked to the ammunition _ a situation the
agency admitted last year may have caused thousands of
``unnecessary exposures.''
</P>
<P>
   Veterans organizations worry that history will be repeated in
the Balkans, where thousands of soldiers have already been deployed
and where ground and peacekeeping troops may arrive later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our impression that the Pentagon is not training soldiers
about depleted uranium exposure,'' said Paul Sullivan, executive
director of the National Gulf War Resource Center, a coalition of
groups fighting for medical care for ailing Gulf War veterans.
``Our troops are not prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said he was left with that impression after an April
meeting with top Pentagon officials, in which he requested copies
of training materials and records of classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In basic training, drill sergeants have to sign off that
soldiers have completed training tasks,'' Sullivan said. ``We asked
the Pentagon to provide verification that classes on depleted
uranium hazards had taken place and to provide copies of the
training materials. They said no.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Dee Morris, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said she watched an
Army training video on depleted uranium hazards during a
presentation at Fort McClellan in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``The training videos are being used _ with some caveats,''
Morris said. ``We're concerned that the message the videos convey
is a little bit heavy-handed.''
</P>
<P>
   The videos advise soldiers to minimize the time they spend
around blast sites, maximize their distance from the wreckage, or
wear protective clothing, including gas masks, if they know they
will be exposed to its radioactive dust or debris for more than a
few minutes. The video says contaminated dust can be ingested if
gloves are not worn, and the dust is not washed off before eating,
drinking or using the latrine.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Morris also said the newest edition of the Army's
training manual is available and includes information on avoiding
depleted uranium hazards on the battlefield. The book Soldier's
Manual of Common Tasks lists dozens of duties soldiers must master
in basic training _ how to load an M-16 rifle, read a compass, put
on a gas mask.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said last year that the new edition would include
information on how soldiers should protect themselves from depleted
uranium dust and debris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've actually seen it,'' Morris said of the thick paperback
book with its distinctive green camouflage cover.
</P>
<P>
   Later she admitted, however, that she hadn't seen the manual,
which has not been sent to the printer.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Benson, an Army spokesman, said no publication date has been
set for the manual. He said the Army has prepared materials for
commanders and training officers that will be used in the interim,
as a stopgap measure.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Dan Fahey, author of a 1998 report that criticized the decision
not to train Gulf War troops or conduct medical screenings after
the war, said it appeared the Pentagon was trying to dodge its
responsibilities once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``If American forces don't have radiation detection devices and
protective clothing, and if they haven't been trained about the
hazards of depleted uranium, they should not be sent to Kosovo or
other areas where it has been shot,'' said Fahey, a staff member at
Swords to Plowshares, a San Francisco veterans' rights group. ``If
they are exposed, they should be tested as soon as possible, in
accordance with Army regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Fahey said the United States should also keep track of where the
ammunition is fired, so that the areas of contamination can be
identified later and cleaned up.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Pentagon has downplayed the health risks of
combat exposure to depleted uranium, contradicting the findings of
reports published before the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   A 1990 study by an Army contractor said health hazards linked to
exposure _ kidney damage and cancer _ were manageable only with
proper ``industrial hygiene controls and monitoring, field practice
... and medical surveillance.'
</P>
<P>
   When depleted uranium explodes, it aerosolizes, creating a fine
mist of radioactive particles.
</P>
<P>
   While Pentagon scientists now say there is little reason for
concern about inhaling depleted uranium dust, independent
specialists say the substance can damage any part of the body in
which it is stored, including the lungs, lymph nodes, liver,
kidneys, muscle and bone.
</P>
<P>
   Many Gulf War veterans worry that the illnesses that plague them
today may be linked to their exposure to depleted uranium.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Iraqi doctors said they feared a disturbing rise in
leukemia and stomach cancer among civilians who live near the
former war zone may be linked to depleted uranium contamination of
Iraqi farmland.

 &HT;    First woman cadet to graduate from Citadel
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ All alone, Nancy Mace strides across the
grassy parade ground. Eyes straight ahead, her slender arms
swinging in gentle cadence, the 21-year-old woman in gray will
march into history today as the first woman to graduate from The
Citadel in its 153-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Mace will complete the arduous journey started by Shannon
Faulkner. A federal judge ordered Faulkner admitted to the corps of
cadets in August 1995, but she dropped out within days, saying she
felt isolated and exhausted by her 2 1/2-year legal fight to become
the school's first female cadet.
</P>
<P>
   Mace's isolation at noontime Thursday was fleeting, and that
illustrates the progress by the state-supported military college in
assimilating women. Their numbers are growing _ 41 among 1,800
cadets this year _ and there could be 100 next school year.
</P>
<P>
   Mace crossed the parade grounds from her barracks to Mark Clark
Hall, where members of the state-supported military college's Board
of Visitors congratulated the cadet captain with a 3.67 GPA in
business administration.
</P>
<P>
   That same board of prominent alumni had fought Faulkner's
assault on single-gender education. Now in embracing women, they're
making it possible for female cadets to tap into the influential
network of alumni who've provided jobs and contacts to male cadets
for generations. In court, Faulkner's lawyers argued that by
denying women admission, the school was depriving them of such
contacts. Mace is going to work in Charlotte as an analyst for
Andersen Consulting, a job she said she found during a job fair,
not from a Citadel alumnus. But she said, ``The alumni network is
out there alive and well. There are a large number of individuals
who are ready to help me.''
</P>
<P>
   Masculine history pervades The Citadel, from a plaque honoring
the ``Citadel men'' who died during War II to gold-framed portraits
of the school's war heroes dating back to the Civil War. But among
steps intended to make the school inclusive of women, the
Association of Citadel Men changed its name to the Association of
Citadel Alumni.
</P>
<P>
   Alumni support has been particularly crucial for 21-year-old
Petra Lovetinska. The Czech national enrolled in the Citadel in
August 1996 with Mace and with two other women who quit after they
alleged cadets had hazed and sexually harassed them. The college
settled with Kim Messer; it still faces a federal lawsuit by Jeanie
Mentavlos.
</P>
<P>
   Citadel alumni in Washington, where Lovetinska's father worked
for the Czech Embassy, are helping pay her tuition. During her
grueling freshman year, Lovetinska said she received letters from
an alumnus who encouraged her to stick it out.
</P>
<P>
   Now alumni are helping Lovetinska, in the United States on a
student visa, to secure a work permit so she can remain in this
country when she graduates a year from now. This fall, she will be
the executive officer of one of the corps' four battalions, as well
as commander of the cadre of upperclassmen who train the freshman
athletes. Mace, from Goose Creek, S.C., arrived at The Citadel with
community college credits, allowing her history-making early
graduation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had hand-picked a woman to be the first to graduate
from The Citadel, they couldn't have done better than Nancy,'' said
Charleston talk radio host Dan Moon.
</P>
<P>
   When Faulkner enrolled 3 1/2 years ago, callers to Moon's show
hurled ugly remarks at the 20-year-old from Powdersville, S.C. Moon
called Faulkner, who was overweight and poorly conditioned, a
``toadfish,'' a remark he said he now regrets but defends as
reflective of public sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was caught up three years ago in the sentiment of a lot of
people who asked, `Why can't they just leave the place alone?'''
Moon said.
</P>
<P>
   The Citadel's Board of Visitors abandoned its legal fight in
June 1996, after the U.S. Supreme Court declared that Virginia
Military Institute's single-gender policy was unconstitutional. On
May 15, two women _ Melissa Graham of Burleson, Texas, and
Chih-Yuan Ho of China _ are scheduled to graduate from the
Lexington, Va., state-supported college.
</P>
<P>
   Women haven't yet achieved universal acceptance among cadets and
alumni at either VMI or The Citadel, the South's two most prominent
military colleges. A few Citadel alumni are so disgusted by the
admittance of women that they've written off the school. Others are
still upset at orders to end hazing issued by Citadel President
John Grinalds and retired Army Brig. Gen. Emory Mace, Mace's father
who became commandant of cadets in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell Week'' _ knobs' grueling introduction to a lowly, at
times miserable, freshman year _ has been eliminated. The
administration now stresses leadership development among cadets.
When Mace crosses the stage today to receive her diploma, she's not
certain some cadets won't hiss at her, as some did during last
fall's senior ring ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be so thankful to get my diploma from The Citadel,''
Mace said, ``I could care less about anything else, really.''

 &HT;    TEMPORARY HAVEN LIKELY TO BE PERMANENT FOR KOSOVARS
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If the arriving Kosovo refugees are like previous
waves of ``temporary'' migrants, most will never go home again,
immigration experts say.
</P>
<P>
   While President Clinton promises to make Kosovo safe for ethnic
Albanians, most of the 20,000 headed for the United States will
probably put down roots here instead, said Mark Krikorian of the
Center for Immigration Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer you stay, the less likely you are to go home. ...
It's just common sense,'' he said, citing refugees from Central
America, Cuba and Poland. They were also supposed to return home
after turmoil ended, but most did not, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If tomorrow the situation changes in Kosovo, a significant
percentage are going to stay (in the United States), and the more
time passes, the bigger the proportion will be,'' Krikorian said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not necessarily a bad thing. It's just a fact,'' he
said, adding that U.S. officials should be more realistic in
setting refugee policies.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at agencies that help resettle refugees make similar
observations. At the Immigration and Refugee Services of America,
spokeswoman Melissa Wyers said that ``every'' refugee she meets
wants to go home at first, ``but in some cases that never becomes
possible.'' After a few years, she said, the families abandon plans
to return, especially if they have children.
</P>
<P>
   In what could be a symbolic event for the newcomers, the first
baby was born just hours after his Kosovar parents landed in the
United States, and his father said he would call his son, a U.S.
citizen, ``America.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Clinton administration has portrayed the Kosovars'
stay as temporary. When Vice President Al Gore announced last month
that the United States would take in the refugees, he said they
would stay ``until they are able to return home safely.''
</P>
<P>
   First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton last Wednesday greeted the
first planeload of Kosovars at Fort Dix, N.J., by telling them,
``We will not let (Yugoslavia's President Slobodan Milosevic)
succeed in keeping you out of your homes.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the Kosovars have been given the status of permanent
immigrants, which entitles them to stay here indefinitely. As
refugees, they will be allowed to receive government benefits,
including welfare and Medicaid, and be permitted to hold jobs.
After a year, they can apply for a ``green card'' as a permanent
resident, and after five years, they would be eligible for
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Using federal funds, private agencies find homes and apartments
for the families and provide the first month's rent. The State
Department has announced that the cost of resettling the Kosovars
is $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   Krikorian said he had strong doubts that once the refugees are
settled in cities such as Des Moines, Iowa, Dallas, New York and
Atlanta, many will want to return to a war-ravaged homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's important is that we take that kind of thing into
account when we make refugee policy, so that we don't fool
ourselves,'' said Krikorian, who frequently criticizes U.S.
immigration policy as too lax.
</P>
<P>
   The 20,000 Kosovars, who will be added to the 78,000 annual
limit for new refugees, will not have a huge impact, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Krikorian said that they represent a new stream of
immigrants that will increase over years as they bring more family
members into the United States. ``You start the flow, and it keeps
flowing,'' he said.

BUSH'S BUSINESS DEALINGS SHOW SOME SUCCESS INHERITED, SOME
ACHIEVED 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: An abridged version of this article is also being filed.)  
(rm) 
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When George W. Bush first ran for governor of
Texas five years ago, he had no record in politics, only a famous
name and a business career that he described as a success ``by any
objective measure.''
</P>
<P>
   In one significant way, that boast may be truer today than it
was in 1994. As Bush seeks to spring from the governorship to the
presidency, he does so with the financial security provided by his
2,359 percent gain from last year's sale of the Texas Rangers,
which transformed his $606,000 investment in the baseball team into
a $14.9 million payday.
</P>
<P>
   But the bottom line is not the only objective measure of a
business career. And closer inspection of Bush's two decades in the
private sector in Texas, which began in the oil patch in Midland
and ended in the owner's box in Arlington, suggests that his record
was mixed. While some ventures made healthy profits, others
struggled for survival. Some of his dealings raised ethical
questions that have provided fodder for political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   With Bush emerging as an early front-runner for the Republican
nomination in 2000, his business dealings also illuminate an
essential question of his biography: whether his success is
primarily inherited or achieved. It is a question that has dogged
Bush, as a son of former President George Bush, throughout his
business career, as throughout his political life.
</P>
<P>
   The most sensible answer, it seems, is that Bush deserves credit
for much of his success, but that he also has benefited at critical
points from his family's prominence and the financial support of
family friends and business and political acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Bush, 52, acknowledged that his name has
generated opportunities not available to everybody, both in
business and in politics. But he asserted that he has never relied
on his name or heritage to ensure his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks to the integrity of my dad and mom, I've inherited a
great name that has sometimes opened doors and sometimes slammed
them shut,'' he said. ``But the business world is a world of
results and performance, and having a famous last name didn't
strike oil or conceive and build the Ballpark at Arlington, or help
the team's win-loss record. And my name hasn't made any decisions
for me as governor.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Bush clearly has received significant help along the
way.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving an MBA from Harvard Business School, for
instance, he started a small oil company in Midland with the
$17,000 remaining in an educational trust fund established by his
parents. Some of the most powerful businessmen in America then took
a chance on the untested oilman by investing hundreds of thousands
of dollars in his first drilling funds. Many were recruited by his
uncle, Jonathan Bush, a New York City stockbroker and the brother
of the former president. When the company stagnated because of
declining market conditions and a serious miscalculation by George
W. Bush, it survived by merging twice with larger firms.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bush's role in the 1989 purchase of the Rangers and the
attention he gained by managing the franchise that launched his
career as governor. His partners praise him for working
aggressively to secure the purchase and for making improvements,
including the construction of a graceful new stadium, that tripled
the value of the team by the time they sold it last June.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the Rangers, Bush's fortunes were aided by his
status as a first son and by the help of others. The late Eddie
Chiles, who sold the team to Bush's group, was a longtime friend
and political supporter of President Bush who picked George W. Bush
from among other suitors at least partly because of his deep
affection for the president, said Richard E. Greene, the former
mayor of Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   And while Bush rounded up half the money used to buy the team,
the deal came together only when Peter Ueberroth, then the baseball
commissioner, personally persuaded Richard E. Rainwater, a
prominent Fort Worth investor, to take a major interest and join
forces with Bush. Bush had previously failed to recruit Rainwater.
One source close to those negotiations said that Ueberroth had
insisted that Rainwater team up with Bush ``out of respect for his
father,'' the president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said there was a time when he was sensitive to his
reputation as a child of privilege. ``When people say silver spoon
and all that business, it may have bothered me when I was a
teen-ager,'' he said. But he said the passage of time and the
compilation of his own record, both in business and in politics,
had thickened his skin. ``Look, I've had some successes and I've
had some failures,'' he said. ``I'm very comfortable now with who I
am.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   THE OILMAN: MORE MERGERS THAN GUSHERS
</P>
<P>
   Bush, eldest son of George and Barbara Bush, graduated from Yale
in 1968. He then enlisted in the Texas Air National Guard at the
height of the Vietnam War, worked in Houston for an agricultural
conglomerate run by a former employee of his father's and helped
manage an unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign in Alabama before
enrolling in business school. Graduating in 1975, he returned to
the West Texas oil town of Midland, where he had spent part of his
youth, and began learning the oil business by running courthouse
title searches on mineral rights.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of his business school classmates, Bush had
developed no real plan for his life. But his father had made his
fortune in the oilfields, and the industry was enjoying one of its
cycles of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my instincts are toward entrepreneurship,'' Bush said,
``and I really wasn't interested in trying out the corporate
culture at that point in my life. I was single, I didn't have many
needs, and I felt that the barriers to entry were pretty darn low
in the oil business.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, oil made Bush a millionaire, and he used his profits
to build an even larger fortune in baseball. But his success in oil
had far more to do with mergers than with gushers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, Bush formed Arbusto Energy Inc., ``ar-BOO-stow'' being
Spanish for ``bush.'' Using the unspent balance in his educational
trust fund _ ``my sole inheritance, except for a great name and a
lot of love'' _ he opened a small office and began to solicit
investors for annual drilling funds that typically bought modest
interests in wells operated by other firms.
</P>
<P>
   In the company's early years, Bush's father was either running
for president, filling Ronald Reagan's ticket or serving as vice
president, and state securities filings show that the original
investors included wealthy and prominent friends of the Bush
family, corporate chieftains, Republican leaders, Bush family
members and clients of Jonathan Bush. The list of investors was
remarkable for a young company owned by a man of 32 with scant
experience and virtually no track record.
</P>
<P>
   It included the likes of Lew Lehrman, the drugstore magnate who
narrowly lost the 1982 governor's race in New York, and George L.
Ball, then president of E.F. Hutton &AMP; Co. Ball said he was
recruited by Scott Pierce, a colleague at Hutton who is the brother
of Barbara Bush. William H. Draper, a venture capitalist from
California who was appointed president of the Export-Import Bank of
the United States by President Reagan, invested in several funds,
as did John D. Macomber, the chief executive officer of Celanese
Corp. who was later named to the same Export-Import post by
President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   One investor recruited by Jonathan Bush, who noted that Bush was
compensated for his work, was Russell S. Reynolds Jr., a leading
corporate headhunter from Greenwich, Conn., who has known the Bush
family for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jonathan called me up one day,'' Reynolds said, ``and said he
had a nephew named George who was an absolute star and had been to
Andover and Yale and Harvard Business School and was getting into
the oil business and would I be interested in being an investor.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds invested $23,250 in 1980, according to the securities
filings. ``The bottom line is it didn't work out very well with
Arbusto,'' he said. ``In fact, George Bush called it `I busted.' I
think we ended up getting 20 cents on the dollar. That's a real
crapshoot, that business. But the guy's absolutely terrific. He's
straight as an arrow. He's a world-class player.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Reynolds, all of the approximately 20 business associates
interviewed for this article described Bush as astute, hardworking,
affable, gritty and honest in their dealings with him.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the first three years, Bush managed to increase the
amount invested in his oil funds, from $565,000 in 1979 to $1.7
million in 1981. But eager to grow faster, he switched strategies
in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   First he shored up his company's cash flow by selling 10 percent
of its stock to a New York investor, Philip A. Uzielli, for the
highly speculative price of $1 million. Uzielli, who declined to be
interviewed, was a Princeton classmate and longtime friend of James
Baker, who was serving at the time as chief of staff in the
Reagan-Bush White House. George W. Bush said he met Uzielli through
another Arbusto investor, George L. Ohrstrom, and only later
learned of Uzielli's relationship with Baker. Baker and Ohrstrom
did not return calls.
</P>
<P>
   Next, with his company regularly mocked as ``Ar-bust-o'' and his
father serving as vice president, Bush changed the firm's name to
Bush Exploration. Then, in the biggest miscalculation of his
business career, he decided to sell public shares in his 1982
oil-drilling fund rather than rely solely on private investments.
The offering failed dismally, with Bush securing only $1.14 million
of the $6 million he had sought to raise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really realized that I had made somewhat of a strategic
error,'' he said. ``The business took a little bit of a downturn,
and the luster was off the drilling funds. I was a small guy trying
to enter the market. And it just didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the company had average luck in its drilling
ventures, but never made a major discovery. ``We went about it the
right way,'' said K. Michael Conaway, the company's treasurer,
``made very cautious decisions. But we just didn't find enough oil
and gas in the ground to be rousingly successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who drove a beat-up Buick and wore sport shirts to work,
recalls his firm as being ``a good, solid little company'' that had
a positive cash flow and provided a steady return for his limited
partners. He said he believes that some at least recouped their
investments, and some, like Ball, verified that they had made
modest profits.
</P>
<P>
   But a company prospectus suggests that many partners, like
Reynolds, must have lost money. It shows that limited partners
contributed $4.67 million to various Bush funds through 1984 but
received distributions of only $1.55 million. Through federal tax
laws aimed at encouraging energy production, they also received
$3.9 million in tax write-offs. Bush, meanwhile, drew a $75,000
salary and owned 80 percent of Arbusto, which contributed $102,000
to the various drilling funds and took distributions of $362,000.

<P>
   THE DRY WELL: OIL PRICES FALL; ENTER AN EMIRATE
</P>
<P>
   Burned by his 1982 experience but still anxious to grow, Bush
merged Bush Exploration in 1984 with Spectrum 7 Energy Corp., a
drilling firm based in Cincinnati with an office in Midland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good fit because we were both small and it gave us
bigger size,'' said William O. DeWitt Jr., one of Spectrum's
principals, who also was the son of the former owner of the
Cincinnati Reds. ``We saw it as an opportunity to grow and to get
George, too, who we thought was a dynamic leader and who we thought
would be very good for our business.'' After a stock swap, Bush
became chairman, chief executive officer and a director, with
ownership of about 15 percent of the company, according to a
Spectrum prospectus.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, in 1986, world oil prices collapsed, plummeting
from $26 a barrel in January to below $10 in April. Faced with the
prospect of laying off Spectrum's 15 employees and liquidating its
reserves while waiting for prices to recover, Bush and his partners
decided to merge with Harken Energy Corp., a significantly larger
conglomerate based near Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Spectrum, Harken was not willing to give Bush a daily
management position. But it made him a director, and he received
212,152 shares of Harken stock, worth $530,380, according to
Securities and Exchange Commission filings. By the end of 1989,
Bush had accumulated 345,426 shares, or 1.1 percent of the
company's common stock, often with the help of low-interest loans
and stock options offered to directors.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the merger, Bush moved to Washington to help run
his father's 1988 presidential campaign. But Harken hired him as a
consultant, giving him contracts for between $42,000 and $120,000
in each of the next five years, according to a shareholder's
document.
</P>
<P>
   Several current and former Harken executives declined to comment
on Bush's role at the company. But they have in the past. In 1994,
for instance, E. Stuart Watson, a Harken director, described Bush
as an important asset during dark days for the oil business. ``We
didn't have a fair price for oil, we just had George,'' Watson was
quoted as saying in The Dallas Morning News. ``And George was very
useful to Harken. He could have been more so if he had had funds,
but as far as contacts were concerned, he was terrific. It seemed
like George, he knew everybody in the U.S. who was worth knowing.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is why questions were raised when Harken, which
had little experience with overseas or offshore production,
announced in early 1990 that it had won a potentially lucrative
contract to drill offshore for the island emirate of Bahrain in the
Persian Gulf. Many in the industry assumed that the Bahrainis had
handed the concession to Harken to curry favor with the Bush White
House.
</P>
<P>
   But by all accounts, the younger Bush played no role in pursuing
or negotiating the deal, and he warned board members vigorously
that the company was not ready for a project of that magnitude.
``He was the most skeptical of the bunch,'' said Monte N. Swetnam,
who was then the president of Harken's exploration division.
</P>
<P>
   The man who actually brought Harken and the Bahrainis together
was Michael Ameen, a former Mobil executive in the Middle East with
longstanding relations with the Bahrainis. Ameen said that the
Bahraini minister of development and industry at the time, Yousuf
A. Shirawi, had asked him to find a small American firm to drill in
Bahrain because the Bahrainis did not think a major oil company
would devote adequate time or resources to such a risky project.
Ameen said he then heard about Harken from an investment banker in
Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Shirawi said in an interview that the Bahrainis learned of
Bush's involvement with Harken only after the deal had been
negotiated. ``Maybe he was on the board but I was not aware,''
Shirawi said. Swetnam remembers it differently. ``There was never a
question,'' he said. ``They were clearly aware he was the
president's son.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Harken drilled two very expensive dry holes, with
financing provided by the billionaire Bass family of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   THE QUESTIONS: STOCK IS SOLD, AND PRICE DROPS
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Bush decided to sell stock to pay off a $500,000 bank
loan he had used to buy his share of the Texas Rangers in 1989. On
June 22, he sold his original 212,140 shares of Harken stock for $4
a share, or $848,560.
</P>
<P>
   Eight days later, the company finished the second quarter with a
spectacular loss of $23.2 million, more than eight times the loss
it showed for the second quarter of 1989. In early August, Iraq
invaded Kuwait, and within two weeks Harken's stock fell to $3 a
share on fears that the conflict would threaten the deal with
Bahrain. Then on Aug. 20, when the second-quarter loss was publicly
reported, the price fell to $2.37 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Bush realized quickly that the stock's slide would raise
concerns that he had sold with insider knowledge of the
yet-to-be-reported loss. Although an outside director, he sat on an
audit committee that regularly reviewed the company's financial
practices. The suspicions were compounded when the Securities and
Exchange Commission discovered it did not have a form from Bush
that insiders must file when they sell stock, although Bush
previously filed a different form that had disclosed his intent to
sell.
</P>
<P>
   Bush maintained that he had filed the missing disclosure form.
But the commission investigated the transaction anyway. Bush's
lawyer defended him by arguing that he had not known about the
impending loss when he sold his stock and that he had thought he
was selling into the anticipated good news that the Basses were
underwriting the Bahrain project. His ethical intent, the lawyer,
Robert W. Jordan, said, was demonstrated by his decision to seek
the clearance of a Harken lawyer before making the sale.
Furthermore, Jordan said, Bush did not seek a buyer for his stock
but was solicited by a Los Angeles broker. The broker, Ralph D.
Smith, now retired from Sutro and Co., confirmed that account.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, I was the son of a president,'' Bush said. ``I was
very sensitive to the scrutiny. I felt like liquidating the stock
for personal reasons, but I was also fully aware that any deal I
did was going to be fully scrutinized.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission investigators apparently were convinced by Bush's
explanation, particularly his consultation with counsel, said
officials familiar with the investigation. In 1993, as Bush
prepared to run for governor, the agency sent a letter at the
request of his lawyer advising that ``the investigation has been
terminated as to the conduct of Bush, and that, at this time, no
enforcement action is contemplated.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's opponent in the campaign, the incumbent, Gov. Ann
Richards, suggested that the investigation had been a political
whitewash overseen by commission officials appointed by Bush's
father. But commission officials have denied any political
pressure, and noted that commission leaders with direct ties to the
Bushes had been screened out of the investigation.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   THE BASEBALL OWNER: A DREAM DEAL NETS THE TEXAS RANGERS
</P>
<P>
   In the years when Bush and DeWitt, his Spectrum 7 business
partner, flew around the country in search of investors, they spent
a lot of time attending baseball games and dreaming about owning a
team. As the Bush presidential campaign wound down in 1988, DeWitt
heard that Eddie Chiles, the crusty and conservative owner of the
Texas Rangers, was looking for a buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the election, Bush returned to Texas to try to put
together a deal with Chiles, who had known the Bush family for
decades. ``I walked into his house,'' Bush recalled, ``and said, `I
would like to buy the team. I'm serious about it. I'll put together
a group of people to buy it. I want you to give me serious
consideration.' And therein began the courtship.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiles was ailing, both physically and financially, and was
anxious to find a buyer. Knowing that Bush had limited resources of
his own, he questioned whether Bush could come up with the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a long line of people at his doorstep wanting to buy
the team, many of whom had the capacity to just write a check,''
said Greene, the former Arlington mayor. ``But his very words to me
were that because of his great admiration for the president and the
initiative shown by the president's son he was going to deal first
with George.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush quickly collected financial commitments from a Yale
classmate, the classmate's business partner, one of his father's
campaign aides and the husband of a Bush cousin. DeWitt, meanwhile,
put together a group of Cincinnati investors.
</P>
<P>
   But Ueberroth, the baseball commissioner, wanted to ensure that
the Rangers remained in the Dallas-Fort Worth market, and he
expressed concern that Bush's small investment would be the only
Texas money in the deal. Ueberroth and Bobby Brown, the American
League president, then visited Rainwater, the Fort Worth investor
who had already rejected Bush's advances, and persuaded him to bid
for the team.
</P>
<P>
   After learning about that meeting, Bush went back to Rainwater,
with encouragement from Ueberroth, and the two men joined forces,
with each agreeing to raise half of the purchase price. The deal
called for Bush and Edward W. Rose III, a Dallas investor who is
close to Rainwater, to share responsibilities as managing general
partners. When Bush asked Rainwater what had changed his mind, Bush
said Rainwater told him, ``The commissioner's a better salesman
than you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Bush described his role in buying the Rangers as
pivotal. ``I wasn't going to let this deal fail,'' he said. ``I
wanted to put together the group. I was tenacious.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of his partners agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``George, I would say, was the catalyst in bringing this thing
together and making it happen,'' said Roland W. Betts, the Yale
classmate who became the team's single largest investor.
</P>
<P>
   Ueberroth is less generous. ``George W. Bush deserves great
credit for the development of the franchise,'' he said in an
interview. ``However, the bringing together of the buying group was
the result of Richard Rainwater, Rusty Rose, Dr. Bobby Brown and
the commissioner.'' Both Rainwater and Rose declined to be
interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   PLAY BALL! WINNING ON FIELD AND OFF, FOR NOW
</P>
<P>
   On April 21, 1989, the Bush-Rose group bought 86 percent of the
Rangers for about $75 million, a price that placed the full value
of the team at $86 million. Bush's initial investment was $500,000,
which he borrowed with his stock holdings as collateral from United
Bank of Midland, where he had served previously as a director. He
later invested more money in the partnership, eventually bringing
his total stake to $606,302, or 1.8 percent of the team.
</P>
<P>
   To reward Bush for his role in structuring the Rangers deal and
managing the franchise, the partners agreed to grant him an
additional 10 percent share of the team once they recouped their
investments along with 2 percent interest. They also voted him a
salary of $200,000 for his full-time work as a managing general
partner.
</P>
<P>
   There is no denying the Rangers' success during Bush's tenure,
both on the field and in the stands. After posting losing records
in six of the seven years before the sale, the Rangers were winners
in seven of the 10 years that they were owned by the Bush group.
They won division titles in 1996 and 1998. Attendance soared from
an average of 18,218 a game in the five years before the sale to an
average of 31,228 in the 10 years after.
</P>
<P>
   Bush played a role in approving the dismissal and subsequent
hiring of one general manager and two field managers, and he
approved major trades, including one lamentable move that sent a
promising minor-league outfielder to the Chicago White Sox. His
name was Sammy Sosa. Bush also became one of the team's most
visible and popular ambassadors, giving speeches, chatting up
reporters, negotiating television contracts, representing the team
at league meetings and signing autographs for hundreds of fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a well-known name and that created interest in the
franchise,'' said Tom Schieffer, the Rangers president. ``It gave
us a little celebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest improvement for the Rangers was the construction of
the Ballpark at Arlington, a 47,000-seat stadium with old-fashioned
elegance and plenty of revenue-producing sky boxes. Bush helped
conceive the design of the stadium, and supported the notion of
financing its construction through a half-cent increase in
Arlington's sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   With other cities in the Dallas-Fort Worth area eager to steal
the team, Arlington officials quickly signed on to the tax increase
and then joined with the Rangers in selling the measure to voters.
Bush helped plot strategy for the referendum campaign but kept a
relatively low profile. With Bush's father in the White House, the
Rangers did not want the politics of the new stadium to become
partisan. Bush critics speculate that the aspiring politician also
did not want to be closely associated with a tax increase. Early in
1991, the tax referendum passed by a margin of nearly 2-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   Under the city's agreement with the Rangers, Arlington would use
its sales tax to generate $135 million while the team would foot
the rest of the bill, ultimately about $60 million. Those proceeds
not only built the stadium, which opened in 1994, but also paid for
an office building, an amphitheater, a museum, a park, a youth
field and substantial acreage surrounding the ballpark that is
slated for commercial development.
</P>
<P>
   The team pays the city's sports authority about $5 million
annually for rent and maintenance. It eventually will have the
option of buying the $195 million complex for less than its
original cost, with the Rangers' annual rent and maintenance
payments acting as credits toward the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the stadium arrangement call it the most egregious
form of corporate welfare and argue that the tax increase stands in
contrast to Bush's anti-tax politics. He responds that Arlington
voters made their own decision. ``I could see the case if this were
cramming down a tax and people had no choice in the matter,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   The new stadium, and the adjacent landholdings, vastly increased
the value of the franchise. Last June, Thomas O. Hicks, a Dallas
entrepreneur, paid $250 million for it, the second largest amount
ever paid for a professional baseball team. Bush's share came to
$14.9 million, and he may receive up to $2 million more after a
final accounting, on his small initial investment.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had withdrawn from the daily management of the Rangers
franchise after being elected governor in 1994. But many of his
business associates have become valuable political friends as well.
Rainwater, for instance, gave $100,000 to Bush's 1994 campaign, and
Hicks and his wife have contributed $70,000 since 1995, according
to campaign finance records.
</P>
<P>
   On April 15, Bush reported that he and his wife, Laura, paid
$3.8 million in federal income taxes for 1998 on estimated taxable
income of $18.4 million. Their annual income had averaged $416,703
in the previous seven years. ``I never dreamed I'd write a check
that big,'' Bush said of his tax bill at the time. ``Of course, I
never dreamed I'd make that much money.''

<P>
   BUSH-FINANCES (Austin, Texas) _ When George W. Bush first ran
for governor of Texas five years ago, he had no record in politics,
only a famous name and a business career that he described as a
success. That boast may be truer today than it was in 1994. As Bush
seeks to spring from the governorship to the presidency, he does so
with the financial security provided by his 2,359 percent gain from
last year's sale of the Texas Rangers, which transformed his
$606,000 investment in the baseball team into a $14.9 million
payday. But closer inspection of Bush's two decades in the private
sector in Texas, which began in the oil patch in Midland and ended
in the owner's box in Arlington, suggests that his record was
decidedly mixed. His business dealings also illuminate an essential
question of his biography: whether his success is primarily
inherited or achieved. It is a question that has dogged Bush, as a
son of former President George Bush, throughout his business
career, as throughout his political life. By Kevin Sack. (4500

STRANGER THAN FICTION, DUMBER THAN DIRT
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Monday, May 10)  
(mk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   One thing you can say about a life of crime: It's a profession
open to anyone, no matter how low your test scores.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, judging by the following honest-to-goodness police
stories, culled from the Web site www.dumbcrooks.com, it appears
that your average toaster oven has more live cells bumping around
upstairs than some of today's criminals:
</P>
<P>
   THE JOB: In California, a pair of would-be crooks pulled into a
bank's drive-up lane, put their stick-up note in the pneumatic
tube, pressed the button to send it in, then patiently waited in
their car for the loot to arrive. Police arrived a few minutes
later and arrested the two men.
</P>
<P>
   THE LESSON: Pneumatic tubes are a poor way to deliver stick-up
notes because you've got to drive to the bank and there's always
the chance that the person in front of you will undertake some
complex and time-consuming financial transaction, like asking for a
personal check to be cashed or taking out a second mortgage on his
or her house. Better to send in your stick-up note by mail. Just be
sure to enclose a self-addressed, stamped envelope and your
driver's license or some other form of personal ID so the bank does
not send the money to the wrong person.
</P>
<P>
   THE JOB: A 350-pound man tried to rob a Long Island jewelry
store. While ordering everyone in the store to ``hit the floor,''
the would-be robber lost his balance and fell to the floor himself.
Unfortunately for him, he was unable to get up. Some police
officers were kind enough to help him to his feet a few minutes
later.
</P>
<P>
   THE LESSON: Physical fitness is very important in today's
fast-paced world of jewelry-store stickups because you never know
when you're going to fall to the floor and not be able to get up.
However, as a general rule, it is not necessary to personally
demonstrate the command ``hit the floor,'' just as it is not
usually necessary to demonstrate the command ``stick 'em up!'' or
``put all your cash and valuables into this bag!'' Also, at no time
should you shoot yourself to demonstrate that your gun is loaded.
</P>
<P>
   THE JOB: A Houston man stood in front of a store, pointed to a
wanted poster in the window, and said proudly to everyone walking
by, ``That's me!''
</P>
<P>
   THE LESSON: It can be a heady experience to see one's picture
posted in a public place. Still, unless the photo on your wanted
poster is extremely flattering, it's probably best not to mention
it to strangers, especially if they happen to be wearing a badge.
</P>
<P>
   THE JOB: A San Francisco bank robber robbed one teller and then
strolled over to the new-accounts desk and tried to open a savings
account. The first teller quietly called police as the second
teller helped the crook complete his application.
</P>
<P>
   THE LESSON: This is really one stupid crook. Everybody knows
you're wasting your time putting your money in a savings account
these days. He would have been much better off putting his money in
the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   THE JOB: A masked gas station bandit aimed his index finger at
the attendant and demanded money.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be kidding,'' said the attendant. The bandit
moved in closer, at which time the attendant grabbed the deadly
finger and gave it a good twist. The robber screamed and ran out
the door.
</P>
<P>
   THE LESSON: In a situation like this, the robber probably would
have done well to fire his finger in the air a couple of times to
show the clerk he meant business. Since most finger guns are
noiseless, the robber will have to provide his own sound effects
such as POW!, KERBLAM!, or the tried-and-true BANG! And never,
never stand close enough to your victim that he can grab your
finger-gun, as this jams the mechanism and makes it impossible to
shoot.

 &HT;    Doctor's generosity will live on, despite her death
 &HT;    By Alan Judd
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The greatest tragedy in Dr. Peggy Rummel's death
Friday is that more people didn't know what she did with her life.
</P>
<P>
   One of only four physicians in Colquitt, Rummel, 43, attracted
national attention after she was diagnosed last January with
terminal liver cancer and began searching the country for another
doctor to continue her work in the tiny southwestern Georgia town.
</P>
<P>
   But for years, Rummel had quietly built a reputation in Colquitt
for doing far more than her job as a family physician required,
caring for foster children and nursing home patients and treating
anyone who needed care, even if they couldn't pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's always been that way, always so giving,'' Rummel's
husband, Larry, said Friday. ``You don't know how lucky a person
I've been to know her. I've known that a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of South Carolina, Peggy Rummel came to Colquitt 16
years ago to start a medical practice in a place where few doctors
wanted to be. Miller County has only about 6,200 residents and just
one hospital, an aging facility with 38 beds. Soon after arriving,
though, she began working to improve the community and the lives of
its residents _ particularly the children, said James Ard, who met
Rummel when he ran the state Department of Human Resources office
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever a medical neglect case would come about and somebody
would claim they didn't have the money to take the children to the
doctor, there was no problem,'' Ard said. ``Dr. Rummel would say,
`Send them to me,' and she'd take care of them and provide medical
care at no charge or little charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``She could not have made a whole lot of money,'' he said,
``because if there was a need by a child, she would close her
office and go take care of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rummel also began taking in foster children, even those with
behavioral or medical problems who were hard to place.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, Rummel opened her home to 10 foster children,
and she filled the stockings of 150 others with toys every
Christmas and gave them baskets of goodies every Easter. She
provided playground equipment for the local social services office.
She took Christmas gifts to every nursing home resident in the
county and paid to furnish the birthing room at Miller County
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   When a lack of business threatened the hospital's future, she
encouraged other doctors to send more patients there, and the doors
remained open. For five years, she chaired the county's Board of
Health, developing plans to provide care to the area's poorest
residents _ work that continued even after she was diagnosed with
cancer and given no more than eight weeks to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when you would expect someone to be more concerned
about themselves,'' said Ann Addison, who runs the Miller County
Health Department, ``she just continued to turn her attention
toward her community.''
</P>
<P>
   Rummel especially wanted to make sure another doctor took over
her practice, treating the poor and delivering the 40 or so babies
born every month at Miller County Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after learning she had cancer, Rummel posted a letter on
the Internet, pleading for a doctor to come to Colquitt. The
unusual appeal generated national and international publicity and
brought hundreds of responses from well-wishers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But for weeks, as Rummel's time grew shorter, she could find no
physician to continue her practice. Friends said Friday that the
effort sustained her as she lived two months longer than doctors
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was what was keeping her here,'' said the Rev. Eric
Sizemore, a Methodist minister. ``I really believe these last few
days, she literally lived by willpower.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, just last week, Dr. Ikefan-Shango Simon, 34, a native
of the U.S. Virgin Islands who recently completed his residency at
a Columbus hospital, agreed to take over. He drove to Colquitt to
meet Rummel last week, the day she was admitted to the hospital for
the last time.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was at such peace,'' Simon said Friday from the Columbus
hospital, where his wife, Wendy, was about to give birth to their
first child. ``When you give, you do well in life. I think you
could die with that peace. That's a lesson we all need to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Rummel, who leaves behind her husband, a son, Larry Rummel Jr.,
her father and two sisters, taught many lessons in Colquitt, her
friends said, not the least of which was to honor the quiet
achievements of ordinary people while they're still alive. That
theme will resonate during a memorial service at 10 a.m. Monday at
the Colquitt United Methodist Church. The family has requested that
Rummel be honored with contributions to the Miller County Hospital
or the American Cancer Society, rather than with donations of
flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``She deserved the recognition,'' said Ard, the state
social-services official. ``It's just a shame we didn't do it
during her lifetime.

 &HT;    UGA dropout back in town to get his degree _ at age 89
 &HT;    By Rebecca McCarthy
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Throughout his life, Hubert Tucker often planned how
he would return to the University of Georgia and finish his
undergraduate degree, a goal he had abandoned in 1934 to care for
his ailing mother.
</P>
<P>
   But he never made it. A successful career in education, marriage
and a son, service in the U.S. Army during World War II and running
a family business all intervened, preventing him from re-entering
the Terry College of Business as a student.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been on my mind all the years,'' said Tucker, 89, who
operates a gift shop on the square in Lawrenceville a few days a
week. ``It didn't hold me up not to have a college degree, but I
did think of it often. I was just too busy to go back.''
</P>
<P>
   As things turned out, he didn't have to _ the university
determined this spring that he had earned enough college credits
while in the Army to complete his B.S.C., a bachelor's of science
in commerce, based on standards in place when he was a student.
This morning, Tucker will be among the 5,000 or so students
receiving undergraduate degrees from UGA _ only his is dated June
5, 1944.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker received his diploma a few weeks ago at an awards
ceremony for business school alumni, but plans to participate in
today's festivities. When he held the diploma in his hands, ``we
both cried, we were so thrilled,'' said Annette Tucker, who married
Hubert in 1941. Their son, Hubert Tucker Jr., a dentist in
Lawrenceville, had contacted UGA about the 1940s credits, which his
father earned while studying psychology so he could counsel wounded
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me, `We're not giving this to you, you earned it,'''
said Hubert Tucker. ``It was a joy to me to get it. I appreciate it
so much. Now I'll be an alumni.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without a degree, Tucker is no stranger to Athens. His wife
and he have been season ticket holders for Georgia Bulldog football
games since 1942, when the university began keeping records of
seating assignments. Both Tucker and his son have served as
president of the Gwinnett County Bulldog Club.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating as valedictorian from Royston High in 1927,
Tucker attended Oglethorpe College until 1929, when the stock
market crash sent him back home to work. With a loan from family
friend D.W. Brooks, later the president of Goldkist, Tucker
enrolled at UGA in 1932, taking an overload of classes until he
left to care for his mother in 1934.
</P>
<P>
   He became a junior high principal in Hart County, then worked
for the Crane Plumbing Supply Co. in Atlanta before joining the
National Youth Administration in Habersham County, running a trade
school in Clarkesville.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II army duty, Tucker and his family settled in
Lawrenceville, where his father-in-law was a physician who had
started Williams Drug Store. The Tuckers bought the store and ran
it for years, with Mrs. Tucker _ one of the state's first female
pharmacists _ as druggist and Mr. Tucker as manager.
</P>
<P>
   They sold the business in 1965, and Tucker returned to his
education roots, running a Manpower Development Training program
and setting up a training center in Gainesville. He oversaw the
vocational center and then worked with an educational program for
youth offenders, retiring from the state Department of Education in
1975.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Tucker clan _ including Hubert Jr., his wife, Carol,
and most likely their two daughters _ will gather on campus for
graduation. Tucker said he already has tried on the cap and gown
his son had gotten for him, ``and it felt fine. I'm just pleased to
be able to graduate.

OKLAHOMA CITY: looking bad.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oklahomans are accustomed to bad weather, but there was
something different about this storm; its size, the warnings _ the
Howards couldn't ignore it.
</P>
<P>
   They briefly discussed leaving, but opted to stick it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a radio, flashlights, shoes, pillows, blankets and all
of us a jacket, and we got in the closet,'' Tommy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we just waited and waited and waited.''
</P>
<P>
   When the tornado finally hit, Tommy saw debris from his
shattering house flying overhead. He used his body to cover Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   Karen held Jimmy as tightly as she could.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all caved in on me and Jimmy,'' she said. ``Actually, I
think I had my eyes closed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked up and I saw my wife's car go over,'' Tommy said.
``Something hit me in the ear and head. I have no idea what hit my
arm. Bailey was screaming. Karen was screaming. Jimmy was
screaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, ``They're all right, they're alive.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he could stand, Tommy dug his way free.
</P>
<P>
   Shaken and battered, the Howards found rides to the Whitterns'
home about a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment Tommy and Karen pulled their kids to freedom,
they were survivors, not victims, and they started looking ahead
and taking care of details that would rebuild their futures.
</P>
<P>
   Both contacted their employers and got some time off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work for a good company,'' said Tommy, who is employed by a
wholesale office supply firm. ``They said, `Your paycheck will be
there every week.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Karen, too, is guaranteed her job as the family gets over the
aftershock of the tornado.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's insurance company provided some cash to tide them
over. Three days after the tornado, they were still getting busy
signals from all the government numbers where loans and other help
for survivors was being offered.
</P>
<P>
   Once the rubble is bulldozed from their plot, the Howards will
know what condition the foundation is in and the chances of
rebuilding on the same site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to move from our neighborhood,'' Tommy said.
``Bailey is one of the top students in her school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We really liked it there,'' Karen said. ``We loved all our
neighbors. The kids were just wonderful together.''
</P>
<P>
   As they sat close together on the Whitterns' couch, their
children playing nearby, the Howards said they would never consider
relocating. Oklahoma City is their home.
</P>
<P>
   Physically exhausted, they still laughed and talked, never once
expressing doubt in the future.
</P>
<P>
   After all, said Tommy, ``those two little rugrats made it
through.'' He shook his head in amazement and stared at Bailey and
Jimmy.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out ``The Wizard of Oz'' is Jimmy's favorite movie.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy wrapped his arms around Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to nickname her Dorothy,'' he said.

A FAMILY'S PLIGHT: `HOLD ME, MOMMY, HOLD ME'

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ Two-year-old Jimmy Howard is just learning to
talk, but he already knows how to say ``tornado.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the killer storm destroyed his home Monday, he's been
asking his parents when the twister is coming back. Safe and sound
in the spacious and comfortable living room at his grandparents'
undamaged home here, he still doesn't like it when his parents,
Karen and Tommy Howard, leave the room.
</P>
<P>
   The spunky, blond toddler, feeling the effects of an earache and
an interrupted routine, stretched up his little arms and begged,
``Hold me, mommy, hold me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not gonna hit us again, Bubba,'' Tommy assured him.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting cross-legged on the floor nearby, carefully coloring a
picture of a lizard, Jimmy's 6-year-old sister, Bailey, wondered if
they still planned to travel to a family wedding in Tennessee soon.
But all her pretty dresses are gone.
</P>
<P>
   The Howards are among thousands of Oklahomans who escaped
Monday's monster storms with their lives saved, but forever
changed.
</P>
<P>
   For the Howard family, daily life, routine, the things you can
set your watch by, stopped at 7:18 p.m. May 3.
</P>
<P>
   It was an agonizing 36 hours before Tommy Howard was allowed to
return to the home where his family had lived and nearly died. The
Howards passed the hours in the undamaged nearby home of Jim and
Janette Whittern, Karen's parents, watching news reports to tell
them when it was safe to go back. They answered phone calls from
worried family members and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Finally they heard that the gas lines and electrical wires were
shut off, and the area opened to residents.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy and his father-in-law were the first ones in Wednesday
morning. The comfortable middle-class subdivision was barely
recognizable.
</P>
<P>
   The Howard house on 127th Place was a mangled heap.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning brought sunny skies, and several of the
Howards' relatives and friends showed up, along with Karen, to put
in a 10-hour shift at the post-storm salvage operation.
</P>
<P>
   All their major appliances were gone; vehicles totaled; not a
stick of furniture to be found. Piece by piece, hour by hour, the
family picked through piles of debris, discovering small treasures
that made them happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's my kids,'' Karen shouted with joy as her sister-in-law
held up a photo of Bailey and Jimmy.
</P>
<P>
   Karen flipped through the pages of her grandmother's Bible,
thrilled to have saved that piece of family history.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband keeps asking why don't I cry,'' Karen said. ``I
can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the family's important papers were safe at Karen's
office, where she works for the state of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy found his fishing poles and some of his tools.
</P>
<P>
   Karen's wedding ring, placed temporarily on a kitchen shelf,
never appeared.
</P>
<P>
   But some of her treasured Beanie Babies were fine.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of Jimmy's pacifiers were scattered around the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always carries a spare,'' his father joked.
</P>
<P>
   They filled Jim and Janette Whittern's garage with their
first-day's discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more than happy with what we found,'' Tommy said. ``We
wanted all those pictures, and I wanted my wife to get her Beanie
Babies.''
</P>
<P>
   As they prepared to put Bailey and Jimmy to bed for the night,
there was one item they still missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy, honey, I didn't find your blanket,'' Karen said as the
child hugged her neck.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, Tommy, his best friend, Steve Bryant, and Jim
Whittern were first on the scene again. A cool north breeze blew,
and the sky, cobalt blue, promised another day of fine scavenging.
After the Wednesday crowds, the neighborhood was sparsely populated
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy found the hat he was wearing when the tornado struck and
vowed to return it to the friend who gave it to him. The men were
optimistic but more selective in what they decided to save.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the salvage job had more of a purpose as the Howards
started thinking about rebuilding. The neighborhood wouldn't look
like this forever, they knew.
</P>
<P>
   They hoped the pattern would be debris removal _ then
construction.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, May 3, was Karen Howard's 33rd birthday. After work that
evening, she went to a nearby gym to work out and then drove to the
family's new home in Eastlake Estates in southwest Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   Remodeled and with all new appliances, the Howards' home of 10
months was exactly what they'd dreamed of during their eight-year
marriage. Both born and reared in the area, they were within a few
miles of an extended family of in-laws, sisters, brothers and
lifetime friends. Their children were happy in the new neighborhood
and made fast friends with other kids their age.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy fired up the grill to cook his wife a special dinner. Then
he turned on the TV news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Karen to feed the kids, I'm gonna put the chicken on
hold,'' he recalled. ``By then, it was really looking bad.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Leon Hess, who took over his family's bankrupt
fuel-oil business during the Depression and built it into a major
petroleum company, but was perhaps best known as the steadfast
owner of the long-foundering New York Jets football team, died
Friday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was complications from a blood disease, the
team said in a statement. Hess was hospitalized in April for a
broken hip, returned home briefly and then re-entered the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Lean and energetic, with a kindly look but a growly voice and
exceedingly shy of publicity, Hess forged the Amerada Hess Corp.,
running it with a strong personal touch. Amerada Hess, based in New
York, was the foundation of Hess' personal fortune, estimated at
$720 million last October by Forbes magazine, which listed him
among the 400 richest Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But for most people, he was identified with the Jets as their
sole owner for more than a decade, always expecting them to succeed
but usually watching them stumble.
</P>
<P>
   He was emotionally tied to the team while remaining proud of his
business roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1933, during the Depression, I started out with one small
615-gallon truck delivering home heating oil in Asbury Park,'' he
recounted at a stockholders' meeting in 1995 at which he announced
he was stepping down as chairman and chief executive officer of
Amerada Hess.
</P>
<P>
   That did not halt his ritual of arriving at the office every day
at 9, even though his son, John, took charge of the company.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to John B. Hess of New York, Hess is survived by his
wife, Norma, of New York; two daughters, Marlene Hess of New York
and Connie Williams of Haverford, Pa., and seven grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   One day in 1995, Hess, in a rare appearance before the cameras
that he abhorred, made a startling announcement as owner of the
Jets. He had dismissed coach Pete Carroll following the team's 6-10
finish in 1994 and hired Rich Kotite. He explained his actions on a
stage at the Jets' training complex: ``I'm 80 years old. I want
results now.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only the second time he had held a news conference as the
Jets' owner. Afterward, he confided to a reporter: ``The team quit,
and that's one thing I won't stand for.''
</P>
<P>
   He made one more impressive appearance before the cameras: when
he brought in Bill Parcells as coach and chief of football
operations in 1997 after the Jets had finished 1-15 under Kotite.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells brought about a quick and dramatic change in the team's
fortunes, and last season the Jets won their division and advanced
to the American Football Conference championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Hess operated in several spheres: the American business scene,
the commercial world of the Middle East, the world of Democratic
Party insiders and the behind-the-scenes boardroom meetings of NFL
club owners.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Mores, had been trained in Lithuania to be a kosher
butcher. But when he came to America and settled in New Jersey, he
ran a fuel-delivery company. His son, Leon, was born March 14,
1914.
</P>
<P>
   Mores Hess' business went bankrupt in 1933, but Leon, while
still driving delivery trucks, reorganized the company and oversaw
its growth, employing a signature trait: boldness. He built a
terminal using old tankers in Perth Amboy, N.J., and aggressively
underbid competitors seeking federal oil contracts.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, rising to the rank of major, he had a key, if
little-known, position as petroleum supply officer for Gen. George
S. Patton. The speed of Patton's tank attacks was in good measure
dependent on fuel that Hess provided.
</P>
<P>
   Using innovative techniques after the war, which included
building his own centralized storage systems, Hess made inroads on
the share of the petroleum business held by the giant companies.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1950s, he had built the first Hess refinery, and he
took the company public in 1963. Hess opened its own chain of
gasoline stations in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   There have been traffic jams at those stations every Christmas
season since 1964, when the company began a holiday tradition of
selling toy tanker trucks. The early models have become valuable
collectibles, and each year's edition sells out quickly.
</P>
<P>
   As his business grew, Hess enlarged his contacts in politics.
His friends included Sen. Henry M. Jackson of Washington and
Interior Secretary Stewart L. Udall. Hess contributed $225,000 to
Jackson's attempt to capture the Democratic presidential nomination
in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   He was married in 1947 to Norma Wilentz, whose father, the
former New Jersey Attorney General David Wilentz _ the prosecutor
of Bruno Richard Hauptmann in the Lindbergh baby kidnapping case _
had been influential nationally in the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Hess was also one of the New York area's foremost cultural
patrons. He was a benefactor of the Lincoln Center for the
Performing Arts, and a major contributor to charitable causes,
including the Boys Clubs of America.
</P>
<P>
   Hess continued to expand his business with his contested but
successful takeover in 1969 of Amerada Petroleum Corp., one of the
top producers of crude oil. That was coupled with his decision
earlier in the 1960s to build what was then the world's largest oil
refinery on St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Amerada Hess took advantage of tax benefits as a result of its
Caribbean base and enjoyed status as a foreign refiner that allowed
it to use comparatively low-cost foreign-flag vessels to ship oil
to the East Coast. But the company also received subsidies from the
Energy Department as a domestic refinery. That dual status angered
Hess' competitors.
</P>
<P>
   His widening circle of contacts included the Shah of Iran and
the rulers of Libya, with whom he personally conducted business.
</P>
<P>
   He was unable, though, to operate with the same measure of
success in professional football. The Jets did bring him a second
fortune. His original investment in the team was $250,000 in 1963,
when he and four other partners salvaged the failed franchise then
known as the Titans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984 he bought out his last remaining partner, and in the
1990s he saw his investment blossom into one of the sports world's
most valuable franchises, its worth estimated at more than $250
million.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The year he took full control of the Jets, Hess _ who had fought
for years to get New York City to upgrade Shea Stadium _ took the
team across the East and Hudson Rivers, from Queens to Giants
Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Hess had also been unhappy over the team's agreement with the
Mets, its co-tenants at Shea, who received the parking revenue from
Jets games as well as a percentage of the football team's
concession sales.
</P>
<P>
   New ownership of the Mets attempted to redo the contract, but
Hess tired of the city's delay in presenting a plan to revamp the
stadium for football. One of his sore points was the condition of
the bathrooms. He prided himself on neatness, evident to the public
in the cleanliness of the bathrooms in his Amerada Hess gas
stations, painted green and white, the same colors his Jets wore.
</P>
<P>
   But while Hess spoke in pained tones of having to move the team,
his onetime political ally, Mayor Ed Koch, was not impressed.
Shortly after Hess' decision to move the team, the mayor said that
had been the Hess strategy all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billionaires aren't stupid,'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   Hess asked his front office to apprise him of all major moves on
the Jets. But even though he met with the coaching staff before the
annual draft of college players, he never interfered in the
choices.
</P>
<P>
   He rarely attended practices but was at every home game, usually
sitting in his box at Giants Stadium with the former Gov. Thomas
Kean of New Jersey. There, he suffered through the defeats that
marked the Jets through the end of the 1980s and most of the 1990s.
Another friend, Bob Tisch, the chairman of the Loews Corp., who was
to become co-owner of the Giants, remembered Hess as ``someone who
suffered when the team was down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He got emotional,'' Tisch said.
</P>
<P>
   Loyalty was among the traits that Hess admired and demanded, in
an oil-company employee and in a coach or player. When Dennis Byrd,
a Jet defensive player, suffered what was feared to be permanent
paralysis following a collision with a teammate in a 1992 game,
Hess repeatedly visited the hospital and assured Byrd of lifelong
income and medical help if necessary. Coaches and players found
that Hess' private jet was available to them if family emergencies
arose.
</P>
<P>
   But he never wanted the public to see those sides of himself.
When Business Week magazine prepared a 4,000-word article on him in
1979, he declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   His first news conference was believed to have occurred in 1988,
when he presided over the retirement of the Jets' longtime
president, Jim Kensil. Hess did not step before the cameras again
until 1995, with the hiring of Kotite as coach to replace Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   In a startling departure in 1996, he consented to an interview
with a group of sportswriters after the team's draft, as he watched
all the players get together for the first time in a minicamp. He
fielded only four questions, answering each politely but with
little passion.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he said, ``This is the only exciting off-season we've
had for years.'' And almost making fun of his own reputation for
reticence, he added, ``That's as much as you've ever gotten out of
me.''
</P>
<P>
   His team was coming off its worst season to that point, a 3-13
campaign that extended its lengthy futility. At the time, the Jets
were the only pro football team in existence in the 1970s that had
not finished first since then. The Jets' glory was always in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   They won the Super Bowl when Hess was a part-owner, with a huge
upset of the Baltimore Colts following the 1968 season. They
finished first again in the AFL's Eastern Division in 1969, but had
not won any title since then.
</P>
<P>
   They seemed to have a chance in 1986, when the team surged to a
record of 10-1. Five games remained. A reporter called to ask Hess
about the team's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call me when the season's over and I promise I'll talk to you
then,'' he said. ``My heart's been broken too many times.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was again. The Jets lost their final five games.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated frustrations finally led to his call for Parcells in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   In good times and bad, Hess made his annual Thanksgiving Day
visits to his team a ritual. He would show up on the practice field
sideline in the morning, often dressed in a knitted green Jets hat.
His grandchildren often accompanied him. He had one rule during
these visits: no pictures of the family.
</P>
<P>
   He would sit on a folding chair after shaking hands with the
coaches and players who came over to say hello. These were moments
when it did not seem to matter if the team was doing well or badly.
He was a happy team owner with his family on Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   But he was denied the ultimate goal, with the Jets failing to
return to the Super Bowl during his tenure as the sole owner of the
team. When he met with his players on Thanksgiving Day 1998, the
Jets having finally become a strong team, he was asked how close
his team was to a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   He replied: ``I dream about it all the time.''

 (For release Sunday, May 09, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After more than a decade of people talking about it,
``convergence'' is finally becoming a reality, though widespread
broadband service is still years in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The cable television, telephone, computer, software, and
Internet industries are beginning to come together to provide a
single wire _ ``a fat digital pipe'' _ that will be capable of
delivering a torrent of video, voice, and data to homes and
offices. The many new business combinations last week were just the
beginning of the latest round.
</P>
<P>
   How will the communications infrastructure be assembled from
among competing technologies of copper telephone wire, coaxial and
fiber-optic cable, wireless, and satellites? Who will write the
protocols that govern their interconnection? It isn't clear, though
AT&AMP;T Corp.'s decision to buy the nation's largest cable TV company
gives a strong signal of the direction that change will take.
</P>
<P>
   What seems reassuringly certain, however, is that the regulators
at the antitrust division of the Department of Justice, who set in
motion these far-reaching events with a trio of key decisions made
over the course of a quarter century, will retain the power to
shape events in the future.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1969 that government antitrust attorneys brought suit
against IBM Corp. on the last day of the administration of Lyndon
Johnson. Even before they filed, they gained important relief when
IBM defensively unbundled the software it had been selling with its
mainframes, thereby permitting an independent software industry to
develop.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until 1981, with the government still doggedly
pressing its case (and suffering biting criticism,) that IBM made
its crucial error. It granted an exclusive license to supply
operating systems for its new personal computers to Microsoft Corp.
_ and the little start-up quickly learned how to dominate the
market for personal computer software.
</P>
<P>
   The very next year, Ronald Reagan's antitrust division folded
its suit against IBM _ but forced the breakup of AT&AMP;T. Within a few
years it had become clear that the effect of separating the Bell
System's long distance business from its regional phone monopolies
had been to stimulate a blizzard of innovation in satellite
technology and fiber-optic transmission.
</P>
<P>
   That agreement became the basis for the deregulation of other
utilities, including electric power and natural gas. And of course
the restructuring of the communications industry was still picking
up speed last week.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1997, the antitrust division again filed suit, this time
against Microsoft, charging it with attempting to use monopoly
power to squeeze Netscape out of the market for Internet browsers.
The trial is still going on; a great deal of evidence has been
adduced.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible Microsoft will be found innocent. It doesn't seem
likely. Whatever happens, it is already clear that the next epoch
will be ``post-PC,'' and that Microsoft will have to find new
strategies if it is to remain dominant.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of all this commotion, Microsoft last month threw a
party, or rather a one-day meeting, on ``Competition and Innovation
in the Personal Computer Industry.'' (Twenty other leading computer
companies footed smaller parts of the bill.) Once postponed, the
conference was held in late April at a fancy hotel near a golf club
in Carlsbad, California.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone was guessing why.
</P>
<P>
   Presiding was Richard Schmalensee, 55, dean of the Sloan School
of Management at the Massachusetts institute of Technology, former
member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, former
consultant on privatization to the Russian government _ and chief
economic witness for Microsoft. Attending was much of the cream of
the community of economists who study the new electronic networks.
</P>
<P>
   Presenting new work were some of the strongest of a new
generation of microeconomists: Joseph Farrell and Michael Katz of
the University of California at Berkeley on ``Integration and
Innovation in Systems Markets''; Jean Tirole, Jacques Cremer, and
Patrick Rey of the Institut d'Economie Idustrielle in Toulouse on
``Connectivity in the Commercial Internet''; Hal Varian of the
University of California at Berkeley on ``Buying, Sharing and
Renting Information Goods.'' Listening were a galaxy of stars,
including a couple of antitrust division chief economists.
</P>
<P>
   What were they doing there?
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence Microsoft ever gave serious thought to
starting an economics department to inform its strategic behavior.
Unlike AT&AMP;T _ which during the years it was under threat, hired
top-notch researchers, sponsored conferences, even founded a
refereed scholarly journal _ Bill Gates and his fellow Microsoft
managers have relied on their instincts to tell them what was fair
and what was legal.
</P>
<P>
   Only when they landed in court did they hire Schmalensee and a
battery of other economists at National Economic Research
Associates, a subsidiary of Marsh and McClennin, the insurance
company. Nothing at the Carlsbad meeting suggested that Microsoft
was thinking of starting an economics department now.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they were expecting to learn something about the state
of the art? It didn't seem likely. The only senior Microsoft
executive in evidence at the meeting was Rick Rashid, vice
president of the company's computer science research lab, who gave
a luncheon talk about how Microsoft hoped to change the workplace
of the future.
</P>
<P>
   What, then? The most persuasive interpretation that many
participants could put on it was that the meeting was a sop to
Schmalensee, a way of repairing whatever damage he might have done
to his reputation in the profession in the course of his expert
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   By staging a a showcase for some of the best recent work in
network economics, Schmalensee certainly demonstrated his mastery
of the subject, even if his client hadn't yet assimilated all the
subtleties. If this were the explanation, it would have be an
expensive way to say ``thank you'' to a loyal retainer _ the rooms
were somewhat larger than the usual economics conference, the food
better _ but no big deal by Microsoft standards. A beautiful
gesture.
</P>
<P>
   (Especially at a time when the company is otherwise engaged in
what the Washington Post last week described as ``an all-out
crusade to win friends in Washington that draws on every page of
the traditional political influence playbook.'')
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the Carlsbad presenters brought some tough-minded
stuff. Especially interesting were the French, who made a useful
distinction between Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and Internet
Backbone Providers (IBPs) who provide high-bandwith transmission,
routing and interconnection to the ISPs. Antitrust authorities fear
that backbone operators would have incentives to degrade the
quality of their connections to the rest of the network, and the
French provided plenty of reasons to fear that proprietary
standards (of the sort that Microsoft is developing for the cable
TV market) pose a significant threat to competition.
</P>
<P>
   Only one paper that transparently defended Microsoft was
included in the proceedings _ ``Causes and Consequences of Market
Leadership in Software Applications,'' by Stanley Liebowitz of the
University of Texas at Dallas and Stephen Margolis of North
Carolina State University. And only one obvious candidate for
inclusion was not there: a powerful new argument about bundling as
a barrier to entry by Barry Nalebuff of Yale's School of
Management.
</P>
<P>
   The nice thing about Microsoft's party, therefore, was the
strong rhetorical point that it quietly made. Economists now
understand the new electronic network industries relatively well.
The analytic toolbox that government economists bring to their task
as architects of competition remains way ahead of business
executives' intuitions _ in even the highest-tech marketplace.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Leon Hess, who took over his family's bankrupt
fuel-oil business during the Depression and built it into a major
petroleum company, but was perhaps best known as the steadfast
owner of the long-foundering New York Jets football team, died
Friday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was complications from a blood disease, the
team said in a statement. Hess was hospitalized in April for a
broken hip, returned home briefly and then re-entered the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Lean and energetic, with a kindly look but a growly voice and
exceedingly shy of publicity, Hess forged the Amerada Hess Corp.,
running it with a strong personal touch. Amerada Hess, based in New
York, was the foundation of Hess' personal fortune, estimated at
$720 million last October by Forbes magazine, which listed him
among the 400 richest Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But for most people, he was identified with the Jets as their
sole owner for more than a decade, always expecting them to succeed
but usually watching them stumble.
</P>
<P>
   He was emotionally tied to the team while remaining proud of his
business roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1933, during the Depression, I started out with one small
615-gallon truck delivering home heating oil in Asbury Park,'' he
recounted at a stockholders' meeting in 1995 at which he announced
he was stepping down as chairman and chief executive officer of
Amerada Hess.
</P>
<P>
   That did not halt his ritual of arriving at the office every day
at 9, even though his son, John, took charge of the company.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to John B. Hess of New York, Hess is survived by his
wife, Norma, of New York; two daughters, Marlene Hess of New York
and Connie Williams of Hed in New Jersey, he ran a fuel-delivery
company. His son, Leon, was born March 14, 1914.
</P>
<P>
   Mores Hess' business went bankrupt in 1933, but Leon, while
still driving delivery trucks, reorganized the company and oversaw
its growth, employing a signature trait: boldness. He built a
terminal using old tankers in Perth Amboy, N.J., and aggressively
underbid competitors seeking federal oil contracts.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, rising to the rank of major, he had a key, if
little-known, position as petroleum supply officer for Gen. George
S. Patton. The speed of Patton's tank attacks was in good measure
dependent on fuel that Hess provided.
</P>
<P>
   Using innovative techniques after the war, which included
building his own centralized storage systems, Hess made inroads on
the share of the petroleum business held by the giant companies.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1950s, he had built the first Hess refinery, and he
took the company public in 1963. Hess opened its own chain of
gasoline stations in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   There have been traffic jams at those stations every Christmas
season since 1964, when the company began a holiday tradition of
selling toy tanker trucks. The early models have become valuable
collectibles, and each year's edition sells out quickly.
</P>
<P>
   As his business grew, Hess enlarged his contacts in politics.
His friends included Sen. Henry M. Jackson of Washington and
Interior Secretary Stewart L. Udall. Hess contributed $225,000 to
Jackson's attempt to capture the Democratic presidential nomination
in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   He was married in 1947 to Norma Wilentz, whose father, the
former New Jersey Attorney General David Wilentz _ the prosecutor
of Bruno Richard Hauptmann in the Lindbergh baby kidnapping case _
had been influential nationally in the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Hess was also one of the New York area's foremost cultural
patrons. He was a benefactor of the Lincoln Center for the
Performing Arts, and a major contributor to charitable causes,
including the Boys Clubs of America.
</P>
<P>
   Hess continued to expand his business with his contested but
successful takeover in 1969 of Amerada Petroleum Corp., one of the
top producers of crude oil. That was coupled with his decision
earlier in the 1960s to build what was then the world's largest oil
refinery on St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Amerada Hess took advantage of tax benefits as a result of its
Caribbean base and enjoyed status as a foreign refiner that allowed
it to use comparatively low-cost foreign-flag vessels to ship oil
to the East Coast. But the company also received subsidies from the
Energy Department as a domestic refinery. That dual status angered
Hess' competitors.
</P>
<P>
   His widening circle of contacts included the Shah of Iran and
the rulers of Libya, with whom he personally conducted business.
</P>
<P>
   He was unable, though, to operate with the same measure of
success in professional football. The Jets did bring him a second
fortune. His original investment in the team was $250,000 in 1963,
when he and four other partners salvaged the failed franchise then
known as the Titans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984 he bought out his last remaining partner, and in the
1990s he saw his investment blossom into one of the sports world's
most valuable franchises, its worth estimated at more than $250
million.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The year he took full control of the Jets, Hess _ who had fought
for years to get New York City to upgrade Shea Stadium _ took the
team across the East and Hudson Rivers, from Queens to Giants
Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Hess had also been unhappy over the team's agreement with the
Mets, its co-tenants at Shea, who received the parking revenue from
Jets games as well as a percentage of the football team's
concession sales.
</P>
<P>
   New ownership of the Mets attempted to redo the contract, but
Hess tired of the city's delay in presenting a plan to revamp the
stadium for football. One of his sore points was the condition of
the bathrooms. He prided himself on neatness, evident to the public
in the cleanliness of the bathrooms in his Amerada Hess gas
stations, painted green and white, the same colors his Jets wore.
</P>
<P>
   But while Hess spoke in pained tones of having to move the team,
his onetime political ally, Mayor Ed Koch, was not impressed.
Shortly after Hess' decision to move the team, the mayor said that
had been the Hess strategy all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billionaires aren't stupid,'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   Hess asked his front office to apprise him of all major moves on
the Jets. But even though he met with the coaching staff before the
annual draft of college players, he never interfered in the
choices.
</P>
<P>
   He rarely attended practices but was at every home game, usually
sitting in his box at Giants Stadium with the former Gov. Thomas
Kean of New Jersey. There, he suffered through the defeats that
marked the Jets through the end of the 1980s and most of the 1990s.
Another friend, Bob Tisch, the chairman of the Loews Corp., who was
to become co-owner of the Giants, remembered Hess as ``someone who
suffered when the team was down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He got emotional,'' Tisch said.
</P>
<P>
   Loyalty was among the traits that Hess admired and demanded, in
an oil-company employee and in a coach or player. When Dennis Byrd,
a Jet defensive player, suffered what was feared to be permanent
paralysis following a collision with a teammate in a 1992 game,
Hess repeatedly visited the hospital and assured Byrd of lifelong
income and medical help if necessary. Coaches and players found
that Hess' private jet was available to them if family emergencies
arose.
</P>
<P>
   But he never wanted the public to see those sides of himself.
When Business Week magazine prepared a 4,000-word article on him in
1979, he declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   His first news conference was believed to have occurred in 1988,
when he presided over the retirement of the Jets' longtime
president, Jim Kensil. Hess did not step before the cameras again
until 1995, with the hiring of Kotite as coach to replace Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   In a startling departure in 1996, he consented to an interview
with a group of sportswriters after the team's draft, as he watched
all the players get together for the first time in a minicamp. He
fielded only four questions, answering each politely but with
little passion.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he said, ``This is the only exciting off-season we've
had for years.'' And almost making fun of his own reputation for
reticence, he added, ``That's as much as you've ever gotten out of
me.''
</P>
<P>
   His team was coming off its worst season to that point, a 3-13
campaign that extended its lengthy futility. At the time, the Jets
were the only pro football team in existence in the 1970s that had
not finished first since then. The Jets' glory was always in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   They won the Super Bowl when Hess was a part-owner, with a huge
upset of the Baltimore Colts following the 1968 season. They
finished first again in the AFL's Eastern Division in 1969, but had
not won any title since then.
</P>
<P>
   They seemed to have a chance in 1986, when the team surged to a
record of 10-1. Five games remained. A reporter called to ask Hess
about the team's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call me when the season's over and I promise I'll talk to you
then,'' he said. ``My heart's been broken too many times.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was again. The Jets lost their final five games.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated frustrations finally led to his call for Parcells in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   In good times and bad, Hess made his annual Thanksgiving Day
visits to his team a ritual. He would show up on the practice field
sideline in the morning, often dressed in a knitted green Jets hat.
His grandchildren often accompanied him. He had one rule during
these visits: no pictures of the family.
</P>
<P>
   He would sit on a folding chair after shaking hands with the
coaches and players who came over to say hello. These were moments
when it did not seem to matter if the team was doing well or badly.
He was a happy team owner with his family on Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   But he was denied the ultimate goal, with the Jets failing to
return to the Super Bowl during his tenure as the sole owner of the
team. When he met with his players on Thanksgiving Day 1998, the
Jets having finally become a strong team, he was asked how close
his team was to a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   He replied: ``I dream about it all the time.''

   NEW YORK _ Leon Hess, who took over his family's bankrupt

Friday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 85.

</P>
<P>
   In addition to John B. Hess of New York, Hess is survived by his
wife, Norma, of New York; two daughters, Marlene Hess of New York
and Connie Williams of Haverford, Pa., and seven grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   He rarely sought out the limelight. When Business Week magazine
prepared a 4,000-word article on him in 1979, he declined to be
interviewed. In 1995, however, Hess, in a rare appearance before
the cameras that he abhorred, made a startling announcement as
owner of the Jets. He had dismissed coach Pete Carroll following
the team's 6-10 finish in 1994 and hired Rich Kotite. ``I'm 80
years old, he said. ``I want results now.''
</P>
<P>
   He made one more impressive appearance before the cameras: when
he brought in Bill Parcells as coach and chief of football
operations in 1997 after the Jets had finished 1-15 under Kotite.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells brought about a quick change in the team's fortunes,
and last season the Jets won their division and advanced to the
American Football Conference championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Hess operated in several spheres: the American business scene,
the commercial world of the Middle East, the world of Democratic
Party insiders and the behind-the-scenes boardroom meetings of NFL
club owners.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Mores, had been trained in Lithuania to be a kosher
butcher. But when he came to America and settled in New Jersey, he
ran a fuel-delivery company. His son, Leon, was born March 14,
1914.
</P>
<P>
   Mores Hess' business went bankrupt in 1933, but Leon, while

PAUL J. LIACOS, FORMER CHIEF OF SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT, AT 69 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Paul J. Liacos, former chief justice of the
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court whose opinions on abortion,
the death penalty, and jury selection helped the state retain its
reputation as a bastion of liberalism, died Thursday in
Massachusetts General Hospital. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Liacos was appointed chief justice by then-Governor
Michael S. Dukakis in 1989 and held the post for seven years. He
had been an associate justice of the SJC for 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure, the court ruled that the state constitution
prohibits the death penalty, provided greater protection for a
women's right to an abortion, and gave defendants greater
protection against search and seizure.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Liacos wrote more than 800 opinions during his 20 years on
the bench. In a Globe story on July 21, 1996, he said he was
proudest of the opinion that prohibited the exclusion of a
prospective juror based on gender, race, or ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1979 opinion on the case that led to the ruling,
Commonwealth v. Soares, he wrote that state law forbids the ``use
of peremptory challenges to exclude prospective jurors solely by
virtue of their membership in or affiliation with particular
defined groupings in the community. ''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his office the 13th floor of the Suffolk Courthouse
beneath an oil portrait of Lemuel Shaw, the 19th-century chief
justice who ruled that any slave who arrived in Massachusetts would
be set free, Judge Liacos described the death penalty as ``torture
in the guise of civilized business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What dignity can remain for the government that countenances
its use?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, US Supreme Court Justice Stephen G. Breyer described
Judge Liacos as ``a good friend, a brilliant lawyer and teacher, a
humane judge, and a great chief justice who contributed enormously
to our nation's judicial system. We shall all miss him very much
indeed.''
</P>
<P>
   A second-generation attorney, Judge Liacos was born in Peabody,
where his father worked his way through law school in a leather
factory. Judge Liacos graduated from Boston University and its law
school and earned a master's degree in law at Harvard University. A
veteran of the Air Force, he practiced law in Peabody with his
father and sister as a member of the firm Liacos &AMP; Liacos before
being appointed to the SJC.
</P>
<P>
   He was the author of the ``Handbook of Massachusetts Evidence,''
the definitive volume on the topic.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, state Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly described Judge
Liacos as a ``lawyer's judge'' who ``brought practical experience
to his decision-making on the bench'' and understood the
``real-life implications of the cases before him.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Liacos, who was sometimes referred to as ``King Paul'' in
the hallways of the courthouse by some who saw him as abrasive and
arrogant, said he was proud to have forced the court out of its
``ivory tower'' by holding oral arguments in courthouses around the
state and by asking justices to sit on commissions studying racial
bias, substance abuse, and other social issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've turned the system around,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 Judge Liacos was named to the state Ethics Commission,
which provides legal advice and information to public officials and
public employees and administers the financial disclosure process
for state and county officials.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the current chief justice of the SJC, Herbert P.
Wilkins, said, ``Paul Liacos was a dedicated scholar, a tireless
defender of constitutional rights, and a committed advocate for the
improvement of the administration of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Maureen (McKean); three sons, James, Mark,
and Gregory; a daughter, Diana; a sister, Katherine Liacos Izzo, a
former Superior Court justice; and five grandchildren.

 &HT;    REPORTER'S JOURNAL: WORLD'S MEDIA JOCKEYS FOR THE RIGHT TO
REPORT FROM A ``SEA OF MUD''
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    EDS: This story is UNBUDGETED 
 &HT;    NOTE: Cox Newspapers correspondent Joe Albright is representing
the world's newspapers in a U.S. Army pool set up to cover possible
Apache helicopter attacks. In his first report, he takes a
behind-the-scenes look at the jockeying by media organizations to
get close to the action.

<P>
   HAWK BASE, Albania Six days after our pool was ``activated'' by
the U.S. Army for long-term coverage of its Apache helicopter
strike force, we were finally ``embedded'' late Friday in an Army
tent city perched on a sea of mud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Embedded pool'' is what the new Army calls it when they allow
a few journalists to live with fighting units and cover what's
happening for the hordes of other journalists stuck outside the
gate. There are six of us ``embeds'' _ two representing the world's
TV stations, one for wire services, one for newspapers and one for
still photographers.
</P>
<P>
   After being ``activated'' last Saturday, we waited four days,
some of us beating back the pangs of anticipation at the bar of the
main hacks' hotel in Tirana, an overpriced hostel called the
Rogner.
</P>
<P>
   When first activated, the pool consisted of CNN, BBC-TV,
National Public Radio, Cox Newspapers, Reuters wire service and AP
photo. But every day since then, the lineup has shifted as the
world's big media scrape to staff what will probably turn out to be
the world's most expensive war to cover. First CNN dropped out,
then BBC-TV, after they and other TV networks around the world
agreed to share video feeds from a slimmed-down TV crew of two
persons, one each supplied by Reuters TV and Associated Press TV.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, the panjandrums of network television were
skirmishing in Washington about the very concept of an
</P>
<P>
   ``embedded pool.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since ABC's Nightline program got permission several weeks
ago to be ``embedded'' with Task Force Hawk here at Rinas to
provide so-called ``unilateral'' (exclusive) coverage, protests
from NBC, CBS, CNN, and Fox television have ricocheted around the
Pentagon back in Washington. How can you call it a ``pool,'' CNN
demanded, when there is also a ``unilateral'' crew like Nightline
living with the Army and grabbing off the best visuals?
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday night, we embeds-in-waiting got a decisive e-mail
from Lt. Col. Garrie Dornan, the spokesman of Task Force Hawk. We
were to report to be embedded at 10 a.m. on Friday at what has come
to be called the ``humanitarian gate'' of Rinas Air Field near
Tirana. (''Humanitarian'' because it is where the trucks come when
they are hauling in food to be transported to ethnic Albanian
refugees by humanitarian helicopters.)
</P>
<P>
   But then on Friday at the crack of dawn, we got another e-mail
from Task Force Hawk. At the suggestion of the Pentagon, our
``embedment'' had been postponed by 24 hours. And all the
journalists in Tirana were suddenly invited to attend a meeting
with Dornan at 11 a.m. at the humanitarian gate.
</P>
<P>
   All sorts of wild thoughts scampered through our sleep-deprived
brains. Had peace broken out in Kosovo? Had someone decided that
the Apaches were no longer needed?
</P>
<P>
   We showed up at 11 a.m. along with a crowd of television
producers loaded for bear. They included NBC, CNN, AP-TV, Fox,
Reuters-TV, ABC, two networks of German TV and AP-TV. Plus most of
us six embed-wannabees.
</P>
<P>
   Dornan was clearly in a conciliatory mood. As we all sat around
on the grass, he told us, ``I am not out here to hurt anybody. I'm
not out here to give exclusive rights to anybody.'' This brought
some rapid-fire ripostes from our television colleagues, still
smarting from Nightline's dramatic exclusive footage of the crash
of an Apache.
</P>
<P>
   Dornan stressed that the main reason for embedding media for a
lengthy period was that when actual combat may be in the offing,
there is a legitimate need for ``operational security.'' He said
that if journalists come in and out of Hawk Base like a ``revolving
door,'' the commanders cannot be certain that they can preserve
operational security.
</P>
<P>
   As Dornan put it, ``in planning news coverage of the military,
some have fallen into the mindset since the Gulf War that all
military operations are for peacekeeping purposes. But Task Force
Hawk is not a peacekeeping operation.''
</P>
<P>
   When Nightline first asked for special access to ``do a piece''
at Rinas a few weeks ago, Dornan said, Task Force Hawk officials
were cool to the idea because there weren't enough public relations
officers to host the crew. But the Nightline team, headed by
correspondent Forrest Sawyer, had support up the chain of command
and was admitted to the Apache base to do some daily stories and a
one-hour documentary to air later.
</P>
<P>
   ``In hindsight, there should have been a pool arrangement
sooner,'' Dornan said. But the pool would have been embedded with
the Army sooner if the networks had more quickly come to an
agreement about which of them would supply a crew to staff the pool
assignment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by a string of network producers to make Nightline share
its future news coverage inside Hawk Base, Dornan said this would
be decided at a higher level.
</P>
<P>
   All this, plus some detours into the logistics of ``standup
positions'' and ``microwave'' relays for direct TV feeds to
satellites, took nearly two hours.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, there was suddenly a consensus among the
networks that the best thing for the moment was to ``embed'' the
``activated'' pool as rapidly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   By an alphabetical quirk, Cox happened to draw the ``newspaper
print'' slot on this embedded pool that will get direct access to
the Army's Apache force for the next 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   If an Apache attack should be ordered during that time, we'll
produce the raw materials for the next day's news accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Our ``pool reports'' _ video, still photos and written accounts
_ won't be worth anything if we cannot somehow transmit them very
soon after the Army says we can send them.
</P>
<P>
   This is easier said than done. When I was a ``pool reporter''
with an artillery unit in the Gulf War, my editors got none of the
pool reports I gave to the Army during the four-day ground war. In
the Gulf War, we would type out our reports and hand them to
</P>
<P>
   Army couriers, who tended to get lost in the desert on the way
back to the filing centers.
</P>
<P>
   This time, to my amazement, the Army is allowing us to bring in
our own satellite telephones so we can file instantaneously after
news is released.
</P>
<P>
   Progress! But my immediate task is to find some place above the
mud to set up my satphone.

SINDEN TOUCH ALL OVER BRUINS' SUCCESS THIS YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- It was the all-time classic Youth vs. Experience NHL
trade. On March 1, 1997, the Boston Bruins shipped three players
with a combined age of 96 to the Washington Capitals in exchange
for three players with a combined age of 65.
</P>
<P>
   The Caps received Adam Oates, Rick Tocchet, and Bill Ranford.
The Bruins received Jim Carey, Jason Allison, and Anson Carter.
</P>
<P>
   So which is it? Does Harry Sinden get a standing O next time you
see him, or do you just send him a brief note of apology? And
please don't lie to me. I know you didn't like that deal at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This trade was made as much to get rid of some people as to
get some people,'' says Sinden. ``That sometimes happens. But what
was our best choice? Youth.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're in need of an update, Oates remains with Washington,
and one can presume he has a nice big TV on which to watch the
remainder of the playoffs. Tocchet is with Phoenix, presumably with
his own high-quality TV. Ranford is in Detroit, but pretty much in
name only.
</P>
<P>
   Carey, whose baffling descent from Vezina Trophy winner at age
21 to forgotten journeyman backup netminder before his 25th
birthday is downright scary, has landed in Detroit, where he will
at least have a nice view of a likely Stanley Cup march.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just can't play in the league anymore,'' Sinden says.
``I'll take the blame for that one, but I don't understand what has
happened to him. It's like Mo Vaughn hitting three home runs in an
entire season.''
</P>
<P>
   The other two? Live, and in living color, they are doing exactly
what Harry hoped and prayed they could do when he pulled the
trigger on what we referred to in these pages as a ``blockbuster''
deal. That is to say, they are helping a Boston Bruins team that is
sailing merrily along in the Stanley Cup playoffs win hockey games.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Burns was not in the Bruins' employ when that deal was made
with 22 games remaining in the 1996-97 regular season (there would,
alas, be no postseason for the Bruins that year). But he is its
primary beneficiary. Allison and Carter, both now 23, are key
players on his team.
</P>
<P>
   Their imprint was all over the Carolina series. In Game 1 of the
current confrontation with Buffalo, Allison played a magnificent
game, with one very nice goal and one very nice assist the most
tangible demonstrations of his ability. It was the kind of game
everyone hopes will become the norm for this talented center in the
years to come. What, you wonder, was going on in Washington? The
man came here working on a 46-game goal-scoring drought, and it's
not as if people didn't think he had talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's faster than people think and he's stronger than people
think,'' says Burns. ``He has the ability to be a top player in
this league.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had liked Allison since his junior hockey days, but
he arrived here with a reputation, and it wasn't good. ``I had
heard it all,'' Burns says. ``Lazy. Wouldn't work hard. I'll be
quite honest. When I first came here, I didn't have a hard time
believing all of it.''
</P>
<P>
   They kind of came as a package deal. Allison and Carter had been
teammates on a Canadian World Junior Championships team, then spent
time together in the Capitals organization. They readily identify
themselves as very good friends. ``That's why it was exciting for
us to come to Boston together,'' says Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Things weren't particularly rosy for them in Washington, so each
man welcomed the trade. Then there was the matter of coping with
the skepticism that abounded in their new home port.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people knew what to expect,'' Carter says.
``With me, it was, `Who's this Carter guy? If he's so good, why did
he spend time in the minors? This year? What are we getting?' With
Jason, it was, `Oh, he's an underachiever.' We were a bit shocked.
We came to a last-place team, and people were dogging us right
away.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-2-inch, 210-pound Allison made a very firm impression
with 33-50_83 numbers last year, a performance that led him into a
major salary battle with the front office. He had no training camp,
and don't get the coach started on that subject. He did not have
the regular season expected of him (23-53_76). The 53 assists were
fine, but the demanding mentor saw a significant flaw in his game,
regardless.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's stubborn,'' says Burns. ``He sometimes stays on the puck
too long. He could have had 10 or 12 more goals, easy, but he'll
keep going and then wind up in what we call the `dead' zone.''
</P>
<P>
   But Burns has had no complaints with Allison's playoff
performance thus far, and never mind the fact that he was goalless
against Carolina. ``He had six assists, didn't he?'' Burns says.
``There are other contributions someone can make to help a hockey
club, and he did those things. Jason plays every power play, and
he's at the tail end of every penalty kill. He logs a lot of ice
time.''
</P>
<P>
   His new mates would have a hard time reconciling the
underachieving Allison the Caps knew. ``We can see the ability he
has,'' acknowledges Rob DiMaio. ``He can be that go-to guy. He has
the perfect game to shine in the playoffs. When he's on his game,
he can lift you. He can carry you on his back.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, whose champion two years ago was head pro scout Gerry
Cheevers, was another contract balker. He didn't even join the club
until 12 games into the season, and didn't score a goal until he
bagged two against Tampa Bay in Game 18. In the middle of the
season he missed 15 more games with an ankle injury, leaving him
with modest final totals of 24-16_40. So perhaps it's a good thing
_ assuming he'd like to remain in the coach's good graces _ that he
began to step it up late during the Bruins' late-season charge into
the playoffs (8-3_11 in his final nine games). He had a nice series
against the Hurricanes, the highlight being the double-overtime
game-winner in the pivotal Game 5. Of late, he has been highly
visible on just about every shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really only his second year in the NHL,'' Burns points
out. ``He is much stronger than people think. Guys will run into
him, and you can see them thinking, `Uh-oh, what did I just hit?'
He's always attentive. Some guys fall asleep on you every once in a
while, but he never does.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to the deal was supposed to have been Carey, but that's
another story. That would ultimately bring us to the Byron Dafoe
deal, but we don't want Harry's head to get any bigger today. Let's
settle for saying that he can smile from sunrise to bedtime on the
basis of what he pulled off on March 1, 1997. That was a day he did
some four-star GMing.

REP. MEEHAN TO BREAK PLEDGE, SEEK FIFTH TERM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Representative Martin T. Meehan, the Massachusetts
Democrat, has decided to break his pledge against seeking a fifth
House term, telling constituents in a letter mailed Friday that it
would be unfair to ``arbitrarily limit my own service.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after Meehan for years had criticized
politicians who were unwilling to limit their time in office,
saying at one point that such people were ``bad for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   While Meehan's announcement has long been expected, he said in
an interview that he spent months weighing the political impact of
breaking the vow. He said he knows some people will interpret his
decision as confirmation that politicians say one thing and do
another.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, Meehan said he decided he has gained too
much influence and seniority in the House to step aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made sense at the time,'' Meehan said of his pledge. ``It
was a mistake, there is no question about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meehan, 42, said he was told dropping out of the race would hurt
the congressional district. ``People have said to me, `If you are
not doing your job, we'll throw you out,' '' Meehan said. ``It is
the people's choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Meehan had a different view in 1992, when he promised to step
aside after four two-year terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad for the country to have members of Congress who are
absolutely desperate to get reelected,'' Meehan said at the time.
``I don't want to spend 20 years in Washington. I want to do my job
and do it well, and then get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Meehan has continued to say he favored term
limits. In 1995, he said on the House floor: ``I have always been
skeptical of the legislators who claim they are for term limits but
have been in office for 15 or 20 years. The best test of any
politician's credibility on term limits is whether they are willing
to put their career where their mouths are and limit their own
service.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1998, it was reported by the organization US Term
Limits that Meehan had reaffirmed his term-limit pledge, and he
told a group called Project Vote Smart that he supported term
limits.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's letter, whose distribution was paid for with
campaign funds, Meehan said: ``When I ran for public office for the
first time in 1992, our economy was failing, unemployment was
rising, and Congress was mired in scandal. In response to
overwhelming sentiment, I developed a campaign that focused on job
creation, deficit reduction, and congressional reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Meehan continued: ``To arbitrarily limit my own service puts the
people I represent at a disadvantage.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans were critical of his explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't trust Marty Meehan to keep his word on a simple
term-limit pledge, why should voters believe anything else that
comes out of his mouth?'' said John Brockelman, executive director
of the Massachusetts Republican Party. ``His reaffirmation of his
term-limits pledge every election was a sham to keep himself in
power.''
</P>
<P>
   Brockelman said Republicans would be ``aggressively recruiting a
candidate to run against Marty Meehan. I would imagine this would
have a big impact on potential candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   But former representative Chester Atkins, whom Meehan easily
defeated in 1992, said he doesn't bear a grudge against the
congressman for violating the term-limit pledge. Atkins said the
pledge had ``no measurable impact'' on the race. ``I was
flat-lining for a long time,'' Atkins said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm delighted that he is running again,'' Atkins said. ``He
has been an extraordinarily effective for the district, the state
and the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Meehan, who received 71 percent of the vote last year, so far
faces no announced opposition.

AFTER A SLOW START, UNIVERSITIES BEGIN TO RECOGNIZE THE FIELD OF
TRAUMA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., N.Y., Fla., S.D., Ill., Conn., Mass., Calif.)   By PATRICIA COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Soeren Buus Jensen got ready to give a seminar on treating
the shaken Kosovars arriving at Fort Dix, N.J., he recalled the
chaos of the Bosnian refugee camps where he had worked four years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen, the chairman of psychiatry at Copenhagen University
Hospital in Denmark and the World Health Organization's former
coordinator for mental health during the war, was frustrated by how
difficult it was to help terrorized survivors cope with their
trauma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to New York to learn how it was done here,'' he said,
``but that turned upside down.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no program in the city. So he and Jack Saul, a
clinical assistant professor in psychiatry, decided to create one.
Last year, they inaugurated the International Trauma Studies
program at New York University. Designed for professionals already
working in the field, Saul says it is one of the first in the
United States to combine academic research on trauma with mental
health programs developed under wartime conditions.
</P>
<P>
   From the punishing cycle of violence in the Balkans to the
string of teenage killing sprees at high schools, trauma has become
nearly as commonplace as the weather on the evening news. Whether
in the form of wartime compensation, charges of childhood sexual
abuse, or insurance claims, it has rippled through boardrooms and
bedrooms, emergency rooms and courtrooms across the United States.
Nearly everywhere, it seems, except the university classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Although many skeptics question whether the effects of trauma
are genuine, a number of specialists in the field say that American
universities have been slow to contribute to the recent flood of
advances in the study and treatment of trauma. Traditionally the
domain of psychology, trauma has more recently grabbed the
attention of nurses, social workers, neurobiologists, public health
workers, medical researchers and more. Yet universities, they say,
have often failed to knit together these various disciplines and
take the lead in creating comprehensive study and research
programs.
</P>
<P>
   That may be changing. The experience of clinicians who work with
sexually abused children, disaster survivors, refugees and the like
has begun to force colleges to rethink their approach. At the same
time, advances in neurobiology are showing that trauma can affect
the body much more than previously thought. Brain imaging
techniques and medical research have found that trauma leaves its
scars on the very structure of the brain and central nervous
system, that it can alter the immune system, cripple learning, and
shorten lifespan. The result could transform the way trauma is
taught, understood and treated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Academe is being overtaken by what is happening in the real
world,'' says Charles Figley, Director of the awkwardly named
Traumatology Institute at Florida State University. ``Now there is
a critical mass of scholarly and professional work in trauma
studies, and a critical mass of students who demand this. That's
exactly how new fields start.''
</P>
<P>
   This month, Florida State is reviewing a proposal to become the
first school in the country to offer a graduate degree in trauma
studies. Said Figley, ``It's almost like the university is finally
coming around.''
</P>
<P>
   Other colleges are experimenting as well. The University of
South Dakota now offers a degree in disaster psychology. The
program, approved four months ago by the state board of regents, is
aimed at psychology students who want to specialize in researching
and responding to catastrophes like hurricanes and earthquakes. The
University of Illinois at Chicago has just established a fellowship
in Refugee Mental Health for psychiatry residents. Both UIC and
Yale University have sponsored monthly trauma studies workshops in
recent years for professionals, scholars and survivors to talk
about the latest developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This field is exploding; it's taken off,'' said Judith Herman,
a clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Trauma is not a new idea. Writers as far back as Homer wrote of
it, societies as old as Carthage lived through it. But the
recognition of trauma as a specific disorder appropriate for
scientific scrutiny is barely 100 years old.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Herman explains in her classic book ``Trauma and
Recovery,'' the understanding of trauma has been shaped as much by
social attitudes and politics as by medical research. Without a
political movement to support the scientific investigation, trauma
research has sunk out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   The 19th-century French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot was the
first to study hysteria, rescuing it from the domain of demons and
witches, and claiming it for science. Sigmund Freud, Joseph Breuer
and Pierre Janet, who attended Charcot's famous
Barnum-and-Bailyesque lectures, built on the idea that hysteria was
the result of traumatic experiences.
</P>
<P>
   The subject disappeared until the First World War resuscitated
it. Traumatic reactions were considered a sign of deep character
flaws. Shell-shocked soldiers were often described as ``moral
invalids'' and threatened with court martials. The British
psychiatrist Lewis Yealland tried to shame and punish traumatized
soldiers back to health. He applied electric shocks to the vocal
cords of those who had lost their ability to speak. As the anti-war
movement in Britain grew, so did a more compassionate approach
based on psychoanalytic principles.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly Vietnam veterans who joined the antiwar movement
argued their comrades who were haunted by nightmares and
flashbacks, rage and panic were not weak-willed cowards, but
suffered from the severe aftershocks of combat. Bessel van der
Kolk, who now runs the country's largest trauma clinic in
Brookline, Mass., remembers treating veterans after the war: Even
in 1978, ``there was not a single book in the Boston Veterans
Administration library on war neurosis.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only a political alliance between Vietnam veterans and
feminists (who brought the trauma of rape victims and battered
wives into the open) that eventually forced the scientific
establishment to take notice. In 1980 ``post-traumatic stress
disorder'' was included in the official manual of mental disorders
put out by the American Psychiatric Association.

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trauma is not simply a more extreme version of everyday stress.
People can't just snap out it. Exposure to terrifying events can
overwhelm and break down the body's natural system of self-defense.
Traumatic memories continually bulldoze their way into the present.
Research shows these may be stored in a different part of the brain
than regular memories, says van der Kolk, who is also a psychiatry
professor at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   Trauma leaves its mark on the brain in other ways as well, he
adds. Researchers examining Vietnam veterans who suffered from
severe PTSD found that the hippocampus _ the part of the brain
involved in memory _ had significantly shrunk in size. Another
study found that women with histories of chronic sexual abuse had a
higher than average number of immunological disorders. Most
recently, a large-scale study in California found that people who
were exposed to traumatic events as children were much more likely
to develop lung disease, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, cancer
and drug and alcohol addictions. Yet even now, van der Kolk says,
``major institutions, notably Harvard, have resisted looking at how
reality shapes biology.''
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Trauma's sprawling character is precisely what has made it so
difficult for universities to swallow. ``It doesn't fit into
existing structure,'' said Figley, a Vietnam veteran whose anti-war
activities got him interested in the field, ``that's why
universities have been slow to move into this. ''
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   With the field less than 20 years old, many questions about
trauma remain unanswered: How does it affect the ability to learn?
How does it cripple a child's development? Does trauma trigger
other mental disorders? Physical diseases? Is psychoanalysis an
outdated approach for dealing with mass trauma?
</P>
<P>
   Both university professors and clinicians believe no single
discipline has the answers. ``Psychoanalysis was never intended to
be all things,'' explained Stevan Weine, an associate professor of
psychiatry at the University of Illinois, who has worked with
Bosnian refugees. ``One thing it certainly was never to be was a
public health effort to address the social suffering of genocide
survivors. The mental health work with survivors... was influenced
far less by psychoanalysis and more by the social psychiatry and
the community mental health movement.''
</P>
<P>
   At this early stage, it's not surprising that intellectual
breakthroughs, particularly in regard to treatment, are more likely
to come from the field than the classroom. For instance, clinicians
working with severely abused children here developed techniques to
curb traumatic memories.
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   But while Saul think it will take years before such experience
is woven into the academic mainstream, he believes ``creating a
multidisciplinary program, enables the kind of work that is being
done in the field to be done in the university setting.''
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Herman says there has been a lot of intellectual
cross-fertilization between clinicians and university researchers.
But she add, ``Sometimes academics don't understand how deeply
dependent they are to the grass roots activists and how indebted
the whole field is to them.''

JOHN PAUL II MAKES HISTORIC VISIT TO ROMANIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUCHAREST, Romania _ Fulfilling a dream long denied, John Paul
II arrived in Romania Friday for the first visit of a pope to a
predominantly Orthodox country in more than 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Reveling in the symbolism, the pope drove up to the Orthodox
Cathedral in his glass-encased white jeep with Patriarch Teoctist
of the Romanian Orthodox Church at his side, both of them in white
vestments and smiling broadly. It was the first time that a
non-Catholic religious leader has ridden shoulder to shoulder with
the pope inside the pope mobile. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I kissed the ground with great emotion, grateful most of all
to God who in his benevolence allowed me to see this desire
realized,'' the pope said at the airport, where the patriarch
greeted him with a kiss. The two leaders later prayed side by side
at the Orthodox Cathedral, amid icons, incense and the chanting of
an Orthodox choir. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For this pope, who 20 years ago first expressed his hopes of
mending the breach between the Catholic and Orthodox churches
before the end of the second millennium, the trip has a haunting
resonance. On the eve of the year 2000, the aging pope's three-day
visit is a historic step that nevertheless falls short of his early
aim of full reconciliation between East and West. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His delight was evident, but his carefully curtailed schedule in
Bucharest also underscored the deep divisions that have kept
Catholic and Orthodox Christians apart since the Great Schism of
1054. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pope himself referred to the most recent tensions between
the Orthodox Church and Romania's Greek-Catholic church, which
follows Eastern rites but is loyal to Rome. Both suffered under
communism, but Catholics, seen as less compliant by the regime,
were persecuted mercilessly, and their church property was given
over to the Orthodox church. Now, the churches are locked in a
bitter battle over the return of confiscated property.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that my visit will help heal the wounds inflicted on
the relationship between our churches during the past 50 years,''
the pope said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those troubles, moreover, have been inflamed by the bombing
campaign next door, where Orthodox Serbs are at war with NATO. In
the eyes of at least some Orthodox leaders, the West is not just
attacking the political regime in Belgrade, it is also undermining
a rival Christian church. In his visit, John Paul II is seeking to
allay deep-seated mistrust among Orthodox Christians at a time when
their faith in their fellow Christians is daily tested by the war
in Yugoslavia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Patriarch Teoctist on Friday suggested a joint effort to end
that conflict, telling the pope, ``you fight against the spirit of
secularization and you work for the reconciliation of peoples, and
that is why we hope the presence of your holiness will be a good
occasion to bring a common testimony to the drama of Yugoslavia _ a
territory placed in the middle of Christian Europe _ by asking
together for an immediate halt to the war.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The patriarch praised the visit's importance, but he also
pointed out its limits. ``We hope this visit will deepen and
reinforce our efforts of dialogue,'' the patriarch told reporters.
``This moment represents one effort among others. This is easier
than the theological effort,'' he added dryly, ``because
theologians always complicate things.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He referred to the pope's presence as an ``essentially
ecumenical visit.'' The Vatican, however, described it as a
pastoral visit, in which the pope could also minister to his
Catholic flock. The Orthodox church has sought to minimize that
aspect, insisting that the pope remain in Bucharest and not travel
to Transylvania, where most Romanian Catholics live, and where
tensions are particularly high. (In one incident last year, the two
sides came to blows inside a contested cathedral, overturning the
altar.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Orthodox church is made up of 15 autonomous denominations
with 300 million members, most of whom are in Eastern Europe. More
than 80 percent of Romania's population of 23 million is Orthodox. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The main issue separating Orthodox Christians and Catholics is
the authority of the pope. Orthodoxy rejects the Catholic belief in
his primacy and his infallibility on matters of faith and morals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Romania's was the only Orthodox Church to extend the pope an
invitation, and it did so under considerable pressure from
President Emil Constantinescu. To the Romanian government, which
wants to join NATO to help its painful transition to democracy
after the overthrow of the communist dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu, a
papal visit is an important symbol of membership in the West.

 BUCHAREST, Romania: the West. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the Orthodox church's conditions for the pope's visit was
that the Catholic church drop all civil suits to reclaim lost
property and allow a church commission to settle the dispute. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that the pope's visit inspired concessions on
the Orthodox side as well. Last last month, Metropolitan Nicolae
Corneanu of Timisoara gave an interview to an Italian Catholic
magazine and apologized for his own collaboration with the
Communist regime, and for not helping his persecuted Catholic
colleagues. Metropolitan Nicolae is one of the few Orthodox bishops
in Romania who has willingly returned Greek-Catholic churches in
his diocese. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The patriarch, who was accused of collaboration with the
Communist government, resigned after the Ceausescu regime was
overthrown in 1989 and entered a monastery. Three months later,
church leaders pressed him to return. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The property dispute is veined with centuries-old grievances,
which include Orthodox fears that the Greek-Catholic church is
seeking new converts and, because of its links to Rome, is a
better-financed, more powerful rival. Such suspicions are widely
shared throughout the Orthodox world, despite a pledge made by the
pope in 1991 that the Catholic Church would not seek to convert
Orthodox Christians. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the pope repeated his desire to visit Moscow.
But Patriarch Aleksei II has declined to meet with him, citing
unresolved disputes with Rome.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the manifestations of the divide between the churches
of the East and West has been the Eastern-rite Catholics,'' said
the Rev. Leonid Kishkovsky, ecumenical officer of the Russian
Orthodox Church in America. ``Many Orthodox see these churches as a
kind of Trojan horse, a deceptive way for Rome to extend its reach
into the East. Those feelings are very powerful among many Orthodox
believers.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who on Saturday plans to celebrate a Catholic mass and
visit a cemetery where Greek-Catholics who were persecuted by the
Communists are buried, also met privately with Catholic bishops in
Bucharest today. He told them that it would be ``just'' to return
some church property, but also warned that it would be difficult
for the Greek-Catholic church to regain everything it lost in
1948. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pope's efforts to reconcile Catholics and Orthodox
Christians is part of an edgy process of rapprochement which began
in 1965, when the two churches annulled their mutual
excommunication edicts, in force since 1054. Vatican Council II
made ecumenical dialogue between East and West even more of a
priority. But those changes in Rome's thinking are not always as
apparent to religious leaders in Romania as they are to their
Western counterparts. ``The new attitudes that came out of Vatican
II all happened when Romanians were trapped behind the Iron
Curtain,'' the Rev. Robert Roberson, author of ``The Eastern
Christian Churches,'' explained. ``There is still a lot of
catching-up to do.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the pope set out to charm his Orthodox hosts. Before
delivering a speech in Romanian, the pope beamed at his audience
and, speaking in French, recalled his first words to Italian
believers after he was elected pope. ``This is what I said: `If I
make any mistakes, you'll correct me,' '' he said. ``I would like
to repeat the same words here, all the more so as I am even less
prepared to speak Romanian.'' The Orthodox bishops responded with
laughter and applause.

REP. MEEHAN TO BREAK PLEDGE, SEEK FIFTH TERM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Representative Martin T. Meehan, the Massachusetts
Democrat, has decided to break his pledge against seeking a fifth
House term, telling constituents in a letter mailed Friday that it
would be unfair to ``arbitrarily limit my own service.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after Meehan for years had criticized
politicians who were unwilling to limit their time in office,
saying at one point that such people were ``bad for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   While Meehan's announcement has long been expected, he said in
an interview that he spent months weighing the political impact of
breaking the vow. He said he knows some people will interpret his
decision as confirmation that politicians say one thing and do
another.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, Meehan said he decided he has gained too
much influence and seniority in the House to step aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made sense at the time,'' Meehan said of his pledge. ``It
was a mistake, there is no question about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meehan, 42, said he was told dropping out of the race would hurt
the congressional district. ``People have said to me, `If you are
not doing your job, we'll throw you out,' '' Meehan said. ``It is
the people's choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Meehan had a different view in 1992, when he promised to step
aside after four two-year terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad for the country to have members of Congress who are
absolutely desperate to get reelected,'' Meehan said at the time.
``I don't want to spend 20 years in Washington. I want to do my job
and do it well, and then get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Meehan has continued to say he favored term
limits. In 1995, he said on the House floor: ``I have always been
skeptical of the legislators who claim they are for term limits but
have been in office for 15 or 20 years. The best test of any
politician's credibility on term limits is whether they are willing
to put their career where their mouths are and limit their own
service.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1998, it was reported by the organization US Term
Limits that Meehan had reaffirmed his term-limit pledge, and he
told a group called Project Vote Smart that he supported term
limits.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's letter, whose distribution was paid for with
campaign funds, Meehan said: ``When I ran for public office for the
first time in 1992, our economy was failing, unemployment was
rising, and Congress was mired in scandal. In response to
overwhelming sentiment, I developed a campaign that focused on job
creation, deficit reduction, and congressional reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Meehan continued: ``To arbitrarily limit my own service puts the
people I represent at a disadvantage.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans were critical of his explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't trust Marty Meehan to keep his word on a simple
term-limit pledge, why should voters believe anything else that
comes out of his mouth?'' said John Brockelman, executive director
of the Massachusetts Republican Party. ``His reaffirmation of his
term-limits pledge every election was a sham to keep himself in
power.''
</P>
<P>
   Brockelman said Republicans would be ``aggressively recruiting a
candidate to run against Marty Meehan. I would imagine this would
have a big impact on potential candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   But former representative Chester Atkins, whom Meehan easily
defeated in 1992, said he doesn't bear a grudge against the
congressman for violating the term-limit pledge. Atkins said the
pledge had ``no measurable impact'' on the race. ``I was
flat-lining for a long time,'' Atkins said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm delighted that he is running again,'' Atkins said. ``He
has been an extraordinarily effective for the district, the state
and the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Meehan, who received 71 percent of the vote last year, so far
faces no announced opposition.

VOLUNTEERS EAGER TO HELP NEIGHBORS CLEAN UP TORNADO DAMAGE

   MIDWEST CITY, Okla. _ Stationed around the world with the U.S.
Navy, Elizabeth Day has weathered a volcano eruption in Italy, a
typhoon on Guam, and an Icelandic storm that swept her and her son,
Roderick, under a semi-truck as they tried to reach shelter.
</P>
<P>
   So when deadly tornadoes roared through the Oklahoma City area
Monday night and passed them by, Day, who is moving to Arkansas,
took the week off from packing.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the single mother put 10-year-old Roderick and
23-month-old Joshua in the car and made three trips to area
shelters to drop off clothing and toys.
</P>
<P>
   When Roderick saw that the television stations were collecting
donations, the Days spent Wednesday and Thursday volunteering to
sort and box and lift and carry.
</P>
<P>
   And on Friday, as residents began the tedious work of removing
the debris, the Days boarded a school bus at the Midwest City
Service Center and joined hundreds of volunteers in picking up
trash along Southeast 15th Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working right now on dreaming up something for Mother's
Day. Maybe take some roses over to the shelters so the boys can
help other kids cheer up their moms,'' said Day, 35.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have helped us, so we need to help them,'' she said.
``And this is time that I can spend with my boys and teach them
something positive. When something like this happens, I want them
to know, you drop everything and go help your neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Christy Wampler, a city worker who helped organize the cleanup
crews, said people started showing up by 8 a.m. Friday, hours
before the buses were scheduled to shuttle volunteers to the
cleanup sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sent three busloads over there before the 10 a.m. start,''
she said as she handed out gloves and respirators to volunteers.
``People are really anxious to pitch in.''
</P>
<P>
   Tinker Air Force Base sent more than 100 uniformed servicemen
and women to pull large debris from residential neighborhoods in
the city, while civilians concentrated on clearing parking lots of
businesses and churches. They moved wood scraps, twisted metal,
paper and whatever else they found toward the curbs where truck
crews could easily pick it up, and salvaged any personal items they
came across. City workers and relief agencies will try to get
photographs, checks and other belongings back to their owners.
</P>
<P>
   For many residents, the cleanup was an opportunity to meet with
their neighbors, to tell their stories of surviving the killer
storms and to count their blessings.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Guild, a nurse and former Houston resident, said she was
used to hurricanes, but this was her first tornado. ``I hid in a
bathroom with three dogs, a cat, a hedgehog and a friend,'' she
said, laughing. But then, tears. ``I feel so guilty,'' she said,
``because everybody around us was hit and we were fine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for pictures of my kids,'' said a visibly upset
Karen Upton, a prekindergarten teacher at nearby Traub Elementary
School, which was closed all week. ``I have 36 in my class, and so
far, I've only accounted for 14.''
</P>
<P>
   Royce Davis, a retired military man who served with the Air
Force in Vietnam, also broke down as he and his wife, Dorothy,
carried tree limbs toward the curb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a daughter who's a teacher and a son who's a paramedic.
He was in Moore working triage Monday night,'' he said, tears
welling and voice breaking. ``The Lord was really gracious to me
and to my family. Midwest City has also been very good to us, and
we're going to clean it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the volunteers recalled helping out during the cleanup
around the Murrah Federal Building after the 1995 bombing. Because
that tragedy was confined to a smaller area, and because it
involved a secured crime scene, it was more difficult for average
residents to offer their services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard to get in,'' recalled Steve Anderson, a retired
offshore oil rig worker. ``I had to get a permit every day to get
in, but I did.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, anyone who wants to help is welcome, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even little Joshua Day, who donned adult-size work gloves and
carried sticks and paper, one piece at a time, to his mom, who
helped him put the debris in a trashbag attached to the back of his
stroller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' Elizabeth Day told her youngest son. ``Every
little bit helps.''

 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Britain surprised world financial markets Friday by
announcing it would sell more than half the country's bullion
reserves, a move that further eroded the value of what once was
safest and strongest measure of wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Gold prices, which have languished for years at roughly a third
of their all-time high in 1980, tumbled as much as 4 percent after
the British Treasury said it would sell 415 tons of its 715-ton
stockpile and put the proceeds into other types of investments.
Share prices in some big gold mining companies took the biggest
drop in a more than decade and contributed to weakness in the stock
markets of South Africa and Canada, two leading gold producers.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was viewed as a maneuver by the British to
pre-empt other big holders of gold, notably Switzerland and the
International Monetary Fund, which have both indicated they will
sell part of their huge gold reserves. Industry experts said the
British wanted to sell their gold earlier to get the best price.
</P>
<P>
   But the broader significance of Britain's announcement was that
it drove a new dagger into gold's lingering status as a precious
asset in an era of fast-paced economic globalization. Although gold
has important industrial uses, from jewelry to air-bag seams, it is
simply no longer regarded as an investment that retains underlying
value.
</P>
<P>
   Even the World Gold Council, a trade group that represents big
mining companies, called it inevitable that Britain's announcement
would be taken as ``further evidence of official disenchantment
with gold as a reserve asset.''
</P>
<P>
   In London, gold ended down $6.70 an ounce, or 2.3 percent, at
$282.85, the biggest one-day decline in more than a year. In New
York, gold fell $6.80, to $282.90.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, gold provided the spine of the global financial
system, serving as a common measure for countries to value their
currencies and the strength of their economies. At its peak, gold
was the asset that backed 59 currencies, including the dollar, and
the central banks of many nations hoarded large stockpiles of gold.
But the so-called gold standard was abandoned in 1972, as national
economies moved away from basing the value of their currencies on
the metal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since then, there's been a general tendency for the role
of gold to be de-emphasized,'' said Phillip Klapwijk, of Gold
Fields Mineral Services, a leading industry analyst.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the gold standard did not immediately hurt gold's
glitter. On the contrary, it was still widely viewed as a resilient
investment and a hedge against inflation, which helped to drive the
price to an all-time high of $873 an ounce in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   But it has basically been eroding in value ever since, and its
allure as an inflation protection is now widely considered an
anachronism. In some ways the dollar, as the most widely circulated
currency in the world, has replaced gold as a measure of value.
</P>
<P>
   Gold has notably failed to keep pace with many types of
investments, notably stocks. An ounce of gold invested at its peak
in the Dow Jones industrial average, for example, would now be
worth $11,031.59, not including dividends. That's nearly 38 times
higher than gold's present price.
</P>
<P>
   Gold Fields Mineral Services forecast last month that the price
could range between $265 and $305 an ounce for some time, Klapwijk
said.
</P>
<P>
   Britain is not the first central bank to sell gold. One of the
main pressures on gold in recent years has come from sales by other
central banks, which totaled 412 tons last year, compared with 376
tons in 1997. But the timing and size of the British announcement
Friday caught the gold market by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The British Treasury said through a spokesman that the sale
would reduce Britain's stockpile from 715 tons to 300 tons over the
next several years in what he termed a ``measured and phased
program.'' The proceeds will go into United States, European and
Japanese bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Starting July 6, Britain's gold is to be auctioned in 25-ton
lots to dispose of 125 tons a year.
</P>
<P>
   Even though gold's allure has diminished, there's still plenty
of it around. Above-ground gold stocks total 137,400 tons _
including 31,400 tons in official reserves _ compared with annual
demand largely from the jewelry trade of 4,123 tons, according to
Gold Fields Mineral Services. Gary Mead, Head of Research at the
World Gold Council, said the annual demand was 1,000 tons more than
mining output.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of volume,'' he said, the projected British sale was
not significant. ``But in terms of psychology and sentiment, it's
negative if it is interpreted by the market as a further indication
that central banks are no longer interested in reserve assets.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest uncertainty has come from Switzerland and the
International Monetary Fund. Last month, Swiss voters in a
referendum approved plans to end a formal, constitutional link
between the Swiss franc and gold reserves, freeing the Swiss
National Bank to sell up to half its 2,600-ton holdings. TheIMF is
considering selling up to 10 percent of its gold reserves _ 322
tons _ to finance debt-relief in developing countries, which would
be the first gold sale by the lending agency in two decades.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest immediate impacts of the British announcement
was a plunge in the stocks of gold mining companies. In South
Africa, shares of Anglogold Ltd., the world's biggest gold producer
and a subsidiary of Anglo American Corp., fell 4.5 percent, and the
Johannesburg stock exchange's 16-member index of gold companies
fell 4.6 percent. Shares in the Newmont Mining Corp. of Denver, the
No. 2 mining company, fell 13 percent on the New York Stock
Exchange. The Toronto Stock Exchange's 22-member index of gold
companies fell 11 percent, its biggest one-day drop in almost 12
years.
</P>
<P>
   One element in the timing of the British announcement may well
have been Britain's independence from the 11 European Union nations
that have been bound by their single currency, the euro, and single
central bank since January.
</P>
<P>
   The European Central Bank itself has not broached the idea of
selling off European gold deposits for fear of weakening the euro,
analysts said. ``This does give an opportunity for those outside
the system to make sales,'' Klapwijk said.
</P>
<P>
   British officials said the sales would not affect Britain's
ability to deposit its required amount of 140 tons at the European
Central Bank if it were to decide to join the euro some time early
in the next century.

JONES VERDICT SEEN A WARNING FOR TALK SHOWS, JOURNALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Michigan jury found ``The Jenny Jones Show'' negligent in the
murder of a guest on the program, in a ruling decried by First
Amendment advocates and seen as an ominous warning about public
anger not only at trash TV, but at the increasingly murky mix of
entertainment and journalism.
</P>
<P>
   The $25 million verdict stemmed from a Jenny Jones episode in
which one guest, Scott Amedure, revealed himself as the secret
admirer of another guest, Jonathan Schmitz. Three days after the
March 1995 taping, an apparently humiliated Schmitz shot and killed
Amedure. He is currently awaiting retrial after a 1996 murder
conviction was thrown out on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Jones's ill-fated, secret admirer show seemed ``unusual and
extreme, even by talk television standards,'' said television
historian Alex McNeil. And it was hard to find anyone with a kind
word for the brand of video voyeurism that the jury penalized with
its verdict Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But many observers believe that decision is more than simply a
repudiation of junk programming. They interpret it as part of a
public backlash against a range of media outlets that produce
everything from outrageous TV talk shows to serious investigative
journalism.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a jury found ABC liable for $5.5 million in damages
after it used undercover reporters to unearth allegedly unsanitary
conditions at the Food Lion supermarket chain. Last year, The
Cincinnati Enquirer's use of purloined voice mails in an expose of
Chiquita Brands company spawned a major criminal investigation of
the paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reaction (to the Jones verdict) is first that it's another
sign that the public is angry at the `media at large,' &UR;  &LR; '' said Tom
Rosenstiel, director of the Center for Excellence in Journalism.
``And it's a warning signal to journalists that that the public in
some manner...wants to hold us accountable for consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether Jenny Jones is a journalist or not...any journalist
should recognize that there's a message here for them,'' he added.
``Increasingly, there is a blending of the media. What's the
difference between Oprah's book review and The New York Times book
review?''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Paratone, president of Telepictures Productions, which
produces ``Jenny Jones,'' announced his intention to appeal, noting
that the ``public and every single media outlet should fear the
chilling effect of this verdict.'' Some analysts seemed to agree.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney and civil liberties proponent Harvery Silverglate
harbors few illusions about the value of the Jones show, noting
that the ``the history of incursions into the First Amendment is
(that) they pick on the medium that doesn't have respectable public
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he compared the verdict to ``the other cases that
have arisen where courts have attacked the techniques by which news
has been gathered. ... There is a continuum that goes from what we
would agree is hard news to entertainment. We're talking about one
phenomenon. You can not, as a legal matter, distinguish between
Jenny Jones and The Boston Globe.''
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of Friday's news, McNeil wondered whether as
``the next step, you'll see in a TV crime show a particular type of
crime committed. Then someone goes out and replicates that style of
crime'' and a case is brought to prove the ``causation link between
the television depiction and the action the defendant took.''
</P>
<P>
   Court TV anchor Rikki Klieman pointed to the performance of
plaintiffs' attorney Geoffrey Fieger _ who gained fame as Jack
Kevorkian's lawyer _ in convincing the jurors. But she also
contended that the tricky First Amendment issue and ``proximate
cause'' theory (that the show was responsible for the subsequent
murder) ought to keep the matter in the courts for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly think they have viable issues on appeal,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The jury's $25-million repudiation of the Jones show comes at a
time when some analysts think the hardcore talk TV wave _ pioneered
by people like Morton Downey Jr. and Geraldo Rivera and now
championed by Jerry Springer _ may have crested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Springer took it to its illogical extreme,'' said
cultural critic Steven Stark, who points to success of such kinder
gentler talk show hosts as Oprah Winfrey and Rosie O`Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   The Jones verdict ``probably will be seen as a turning point,''
that helped cool public ardor for trash television, added McNeil.
</P>
<P>
   Still, such predictions are at least partly refuted by Kleiman's
explanation of why the Jones case was one of Court TV's
highest-rated trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have sex, you have murder, you have possible
homosexuality. Then you've got Feiger. This would have made a
great-made-for-TV movie.'' And a darn good Jenny Jones show.

RANGERS/STARS OWNER HICKS IN DIRE NEED OF MORE COACHING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year or so ago, having interviewed Tom Hicks on a couple of
occasions and having watched him being interviewed by a score of
other reporters at various times, I commented to someone who should
know that the Rangers/Stars owner was very good with the media.
</P>
<P>
   They liked him, it seemed. Privately, several members of the
local press corps said he appeared to be a no-nonsense guy, a
straight shooter who returned calls about as often as you can
expect from a guzillionaire. The sort who wouldn't flat-out lie to
you, even if he would occasionally dodge giving a complete answer.
</P>
<P>
   This compliment came from a group not inclined to say nice
things about rich guys in suits, and that includes those of the
sporting kingdom such as Mr. J. Jones and Mr. R. Perot Jr.
</P>
<P>
   That ``someone who should know'' replied something to the effect
of, ``Well, he hasn't always been that way.'' The implication, I
guess, being that Hicks had been coached, and coached well, to say
the right things at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is not always an easy thing to do when you're trying
to convince voters to part with $100 million or so for a new arena
so that you can make yourself a few hundred million more.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he pulled it off. He not only got his vote, he could do
almost nothing wrong in the eyes of the media, short of striking
out on Roger Clemens. And even then they could blame it on Doug
Melvin, or Yankee imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but the honeymoon is always sweet, ain't it? It's the next
50 years or whatever that are the test.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks is getting his first real media test now that he has
presided over the departure of Rangers president Tom Schieffer.
Usually, it's the dismissal of managers and coaches, or, in some
cases, general managers that gets the media worked up. But a club
president?
</P>
<P>
   Schieffer, however, was well-respected by the area media, in
part because of his love for the game and his support of tradition.
He struck a chord with many when he voiced his concerns for
baseball's have-nots, even as the Rangers' payroll eclipsed that of
several South American nations.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just Schieffer's popularity that cast Hicks in a new,
and not altogether flattering light, though. It also was a matter
of style.
</P>
<P>
   Some media portrayals pictured Hicks as a bit of a bully, a
budding George Steinbrenner, for his role in Schieffer's leaving.
It's a funny thing: Texans love entrepreneurial people who do
things big and do them successfully _ oil barons, cattlemen and the
like _ but they don't appreciate it when they get to riding too
tall. Then they like to chop them down.
</P>
<P>
   From reading the accounts of l'affaire Schieffer and listening
to the television and radio post-mortems, it appears Hicks has been
targeted for a bit of chopping himself.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks also may be paying a price for being a businessman first
and a sportsman second. Every club owner in this century has made
economics his primary focus, of course. Nowadays, it's just a lot
more obvious and a lot less acceptable to those in the media who
don't have $250 million of their own cash invested in
sportsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Hicks, there are ways to remedy some of this new
image problem, slight changes in style that could trigger a second
honeymoon. The kind a media coach might suggest.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Hicks should never use the term, ``vertical
integration'' unless, that is, he's talking about having black,
white and Hispanic players up and down the lineup card.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he should refrain from using the word ``synergy'' except
when discussing Cinergy Field in Cincinnati, where the Reds play.
Even at that, it might be preferable to drop in a reference or two
to ``old Crosley Field.'' Traditionalists will lap it up.
</P>
<P>
   Some areas are more complicated. Should, for instance, Hicks be
seen attending a Rangers game when the Stars have a playoff match
the same night? Hockey fans, no doubt, weren't thrilled to see the
shirt-and-tie clad boss at The Ballpark watching ``The Rocket'' get
hammered while the Stars were gutting out a triple-OT win over
Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think you can fault Hicks for wanting to see Clemens get
lit up. No one likes to be spurned. For those who don't appreciate
revenge, however, it might be wise to play up Hicks' other side,
the one he showed earlier this season when he broke up that row in
the stands at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's throwing around your muscle Texas style. That's the
kind of owner the media and fans can both appreciate.

JOB BOOM LIFTING UNDERCLASS OUT OF POVERTY

<TEXT>
<P>
   America's jobs boom has turned into a powerful tide that is
lifting many of the nation's most vulnerable citizens out of
poverty and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the national economy added, on a net basis, nearly a
quarter of a million new jobs despite continued losses in
manufacturing and farming, the Labor Department reported Friday.
Last month's unemployment rate was 4.3 percent _ statistically
indistinguishable from its 30-year low of 4.2 percent in March.
(All numbers are adjusted to take account of expected seasonal ups
and downs.)
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate has now been at or below 4.5 percent for
slightly more than a year and at or below 5 percent for a full two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, who were a bit rattled on Thursday by a warning from
the Federal Reserve's chairman, Alan Greenspan, that the tight
labor market still posed an inflation threat, generally took the
strong April job growth in stride. That was mostly because the
report showed no signs that wages were accelerating. But after an
initial gain in the bond market, prices fell, and the yield on the
benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose to 5.81 percent. Stocks
gained, with the Dow industrial average up 84.77, to 11,031.59.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking feature of Friday's report was how broadly the
benefits of economic growth are being spread. Joblessness among
workers who have long suffered the highest unemployment rates
continued to decline.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment among African-Americans, already at historic lows,
dropped to 7.7 percent. Teen-age unemployment declined to 14.1
percent. But joblessness among Hispanic workers _ a diverse group
that spans affluent third-generation Americans as well as
impoverished new immigrants _ bumped up from the record low set in
March. Still, at 6.9 percent, the Hispanic rate remains lower than
at almost any time in the last 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing large gains by the most disadvantaged groups,''
said Rebecca Blank, a member of the White House's Council of
Economic Advisers and an expert on poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Today, nearly half of Americans live in cities and towns where
the unemployment rate has dropped below 4 percent, according to a
new study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research. In
these ``high pressure'' local economies, the employment and incomes
of the most disadvantaged _ the young, those who have only a high
school degree or less, and minorities _ have jumped, said Richard
Freeman at Harvard, one of the study's authors.
</P>
<P>
   Growth that is shared by most Americans has not been the norm
since the economic Golden Age that followed World War II from the
late 1940s to the early 1970s. Back then, rapid economic growth had
a powerful effect on the fortunes of America's poorest citizens,
prompting Arthur Okun, President Johnson's chief economic adviser,
to declare in 1973 that a rising tide lifts all boats. But that
changed almost as soon as he said it, when the Arab oil shock and
the collapse of the Bretton Woods system of stable currency
exchange rates ushered in an era of high inflation, widening
inequality and stagnant wages.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the long, strong boom of the 1980s, when 20 million new
jobs were created, poverty barely fell, and many of America's
working poor, particularly less-educated men, wound up becoming
poorer.
</P>
<P>
   But today there are a host of signs that the gains from economic
growth are once again being spread around. ``The '90s are starting
to look a lot like the '60s,'' said Lawrence Katz, a labor
economist at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Investment bankers, basketball stars and computer whizzes _
those at the very top of the pay scale _ are still doing great,
just as they did in the '80s. What has changed is that they are no
longer alone. ``Inequality hasn't necessarily diminished, but we
seem to be in a world where the bottom and top are rising
together,'' Dr. Blank said. ``That's a very different world.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes the '90s different from the '80s? Two things, the
experts say. First, the current expansion, which began with the
unemployment rate slightly above 7 percent, compared with a
double-digit jobless rate in the early 1980s, has lasted longer and
has pushed the unemployment rate even lower than at the end of the
1980s expansion. Second, for the last three years or so, wages for
workers at the bottom of the pay scale have been rising rapidly. In
the 1980s, declining pay at the lower rungs of the wage scale
offset the positive effects of robust job growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not just getting more job opportunities, but rising
wages,'' Dr. Blank said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, a
worker whose pay put him one-fifth the way up the wage-distribution
ladder earned $7.11 an hour in 1986 but only $6.66 in 1996. By this
spring, that figure had climbed to $7.17 an hour. (All the figures
are in 1998 dollars and take inflation into account.)
</P>
<P>
   Those gains have helped fuel a spree of consumer spending and
borrowing in the last year or so. But in March, Americans reined in
a bit, with consumer credit expanding by just $1.6 billion, well
below the $8.7 jump in February. Credit card debt actually shrank,
but borrowing to buy cars rose $3.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, not everything is rosy on the job front. The
nation's factories shed another 29,000 jobs last month, bringing
the total number of manufacturing jobs lost since the beginning of
the global financial crisis to 400,000. But increasingly
well-paying service jobs more than made up that loss. Last month,
service industries created 261,000 additional jobs. In the last
year, they have added 2.8 million jobs while the number of
construction jobs has grown by 300,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going back to the days when the economy was creating
jobs that called for easily acquired, modest skills,'' said Kevin
Murphy, a labor economist at the University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the old relationship between economic growth and a
reduction in poverty seems to have been restored _ at least for
now. According to Professor Katz's study, between 1983 and 1990,
poverty fell by just 1.7 percentage points, less than half what
would have been predicted based on the pattern that existed in the
1960s and 1970s. By contrast, between 1993 and 1997 (the last year
for which poverty figures are available) the percentage of
households in poverty has declined by 2.6 percentage points, more
than in the entire 1980s and right in line with the old pattern.
(The study's numbers include income from the earned-income tax
credit.)
</P>
<P>
   Low unemployment is good for newcomers to the labor force like
women and teen-agers and those at the bottom of the pay scale. When
the labor market tightens, people who are out of work or are
jumping in for the first time get jobs. Part- time workers get
full-time jobs. And those in dead-end jobs find better ones and
have a chance to acquire more experience and skills.

JONES VERDICT SEEN A WARNING FOR TALK SHOWS, JOURNALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Michigan jury found ``The Jenny Jones Show'' negligent in the
murder of a guest on the program, in a ruling decried by First
Amendment advocates and seen as an ominous warning about public
anger not only at trash TV, but at the increasingly murky mix of
entertainment and journalism.
</P>
<P>
   The $25 million verdict stemmed from a Jenny Jones episode in
which one guest, Scott Amedure, revealed himself as the secret
admirer of another guest, Jonathan Schmitz. Three days after the
March 1995 taping, an apparently humiliated Schmitz shot and killed
Amedure. He is currently awaiting retrial after a 1996 murder
conviction was thrown out on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Jones's ill-fated, secret admirer show seemed ``unusual and
extreme, even by talk television standards,'' said television
historian Alex McNeil. And it was hard to find anyone with a kind
word for the brand of video voyeurism that the jury penalized with
its verdict Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But many observers believe that decision is more than simply a
repudiation of junk programming. They interpret it as part of a
public backlash against a range of media outlets that produce
everything from outrageous TV talk shows to serious investigative
journalism.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a jury found ABC liable for $5.5 million in damages
after it used undercover reporters to unearth allegedly unsanitary
conditions at the Food Lion supermarket chain. Last year, The
Cincinnati Enquirer's use of purloined voice mails in an expose of
Chiquita Brands company spawned a major criminal investigation of
the paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reaction (to the Jones verdict) is first that it's another
sign that the public is angry at the `media at large,' &UR;  &LR; '' said Tom
Rosenstiel, director of the Center for Excellence in Journalism.
``And it's a warning signal to journalists that that the public in
some manner...wants to hold us accountable for consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether Jenny Jones is a journalist or not...any journalist
should recognize that there's a message here for them,'' he added.
``Increasingly, there is a blending of the media. What's the
difference between Oprah's book review and The New York Times book
review?''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Paratone, president of Telepictures Productions, which
produces ``Jenny Jones,'' announced his intention to appeal, noting
that the ``public and every single media outlet should fear the
chilling effect of this verdict.'' Some analysts seemed to agree.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney and civil liberties proponent Harvery Silverglate
harbors few illusions about the value of the Jones show, noting
that the ``the history of incursions into the First Amendment is
(that) they pick on the medium that doesn't have respectable public
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he compared the verdict to ``the other cases that
have arisen where courts have attacked the techniques by which news
has been gathered. ... There is a continuum that goes from what we
would agree is hard news to entertainment. We're talking about one
phenomenon. You can not, as a legal matter, distinguish between
Jenny Jones and The Boston Globe.''
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of Friday's news, McNeil wondered whether as
``the next step, you'll see in a TV crime show a particular type of
crime committed. Then someone goes out and replicates that style of
crime'' and a case is brought to prove the ``causation link between
the television depiction and the action the defendant took.''
</P>
<P>
   Court TV anchor Rikki Klieman pointed to the performance of
plaintiffs' attorney Geoffrey Fieger _ who gained fame as Jack
Kevorkian's lawyer _ in convincing the jurors. But she also
contended that the tricky First Amendment issue and ``proximate
cause'' theory (that the show was responsible for the subsequent
murder) ought to keep the matter in the courts for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly think they have viable issues on appeal,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The jury's $25-million repudiation of the Jones show comes at a
time when some analysts think the hardcore talk TV wave _ pioneered
by people like Morton Downey Jr. and Geraldo Rivera and now
championed by Jerry Springer _ may have crested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Springer took it to its illogical extreme,'' said
cultural critic Steven Stark, who points to success of such kinder
gentler talk show hosts as Oprah Winfrey and Rosie O`Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   The Jones verdict ``probably will be seen as a turning point,''
that helped cool public ardor for trash television, added McNeil.
</P>
<P>
   Still, such predictions are at least partly refuted by Kleiman's
explanation of why the Jones case was one of Court TV's
highest-rated trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have sex, you have murder, you have possible
homosexuality. Then you've got Feiger. This would have made a
great-made-for-TV movie.'' And a darn good Jenny Jones show.

 &HT;    Senate report: Lax satellite security allowed China access to
missile technology
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Chinese government obtained sensitive
technology from American satellite launches that improved their
country's ballistic missile fleet, according to Senate
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   In a 45-page document released late Thursday, the Senate
Intelligence Committee alleges that lax monitoring of satellite
exports has enhanced Beijing's ability to develop highly
sophisticated missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that U.S. missile technology was indeed
transferred to China,'' Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), chairman of
the panel, said Friday. ``The administration and certain U.S.
aerospace companies joined in a conspiracy of carelessness and
recklessness that allowed unlicensed, unauthorized transfers of
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee recommended increasing the monitoring and security
surrounding commercial satellite launches. Long term, the panel
recommends examining whether American commercial satellites should
be allowed to be launched from China.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said they agreed with much of the report's
findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We share the committee's concern that unauthorized assistance
and transfers of technology relevant to space launch vehicles and
ballistic missiles may have occurred during certain space launch
failure analyses,'' said Gary Samore, a senior official at the
National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Senate investigators examined whether China
attempted to influence the 1996 elections with donations funneled
through former Democratic fund-raiser Johnny Chung.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators found that Chung accepted $300,000 from Liu
Chao-ying, daughter of one of China's highest ranking military
generals, to help President Clinton win re-election in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But the FBI could trace only about $20,000 to the Democratic
National Committee. ``Most of the remaining funds went for his
personal use, including mortgage payments,'' the report states.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is intelligence information indicating PRC officials
provided funds to U.S. political campaigns,'' the report states.
But the information is ``inconclusive as to whether the
contributions were part of the overall China plan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased that they recognized that the White House had
no knowledge of any contributions originating outside the United
States,'' said Jim Kennedy, special counsel to the president on
campaign finance issues.
</P>
<P>
   The report did not mention recent news accounts of alleged
Chinese espionage at the Los Alamos laboratory and other
laboratories where nuclear weapons are designed.
</P>
<P>
   That allegation surfaced after the committee had completed its
investigation. It will be addressed in a classified report by a
House committee headed by Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Calif.).
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the committee focused on two failed commercial
satellite launches during which investigators believe sensitive
technological information was given to the Chinese. Both cases are
under investigation by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   The first involved a satellite launched by Loral Space and
Communications in February 1996. After the satellite exploded Loral
allegedly shared information with the Chinese that has improved
their missile technology.
</P>
<P>
   The second case involved information that Hughes Electronics
Corp. allegedly shared with the Chinese involving a satellite
launch in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the report found that U.S. government officials
were not called to the scene to ensure that sensitive technology
was protected from the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite industry is quick to defend their launches and
deny that technology was given to the Chinese on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that no security information was released to the
Chinese,'' said Richard Dore, director of communications for
Hughes. ``We were never in the position of passing on anything that
would harm the nation's security.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexis Allen, spokesperson for the 51-member Aerospace Industry
Association, is concerned that the congressional investigation is
undermining the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Congress has taken the satellite license approval
process away from the business-friendly Commerce Department and
returned it back to the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   All that does, Allen said, is make it easier for foreign
competitors to take customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure we don't lose our satellite industry to
foreign companies,'' said Allen, who estimates that the industry
may have lost as much as $1 billion as a result of Congress
switching the licensing back to State Department.

CFO OF LARGEST BAY STATE HMO QUITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The chief financial officer of financially troubled
Harvard Pilgrim Health Care resigned Friday, just one day after the
chief executive of New England's largest health maintenance
organization stepped down.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas J. Brophy's departure from the region's largest HMO was
announced in an internal memo written by Alan Morse, chairman of
the Harvard Pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
   The memo did not state a reason for Brophy's resignation.
Harvard Pilgrim spokesman Alan Raymond declined to elaborate,
saying, ``There's nothing to add.''
</P>
<P>
   Brophy, reached at his home, refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   His depature did not come as a surprise because of the CFO's
close ties to Allan Greenberg, who abruptly quit Thursday as CEO.
The dual resignations came a week after Harvard Pilgrim announced
it lost $94 million from operations, its largest annual losses
ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom has been closely aligned with Allan for a long time, so
it's not entirely surprising,'' said Stephen Weiner, a health care
attorney for Mintz Levin Cohn Ferris Glovsky &AMP; Popeo in Boston.
``But it does reinforce concerns about the stability of the
leadership and whether the management is going to be able to handle
the constant internal and external pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   Speculation swirled Friday about the future direction of Harvard
Pilgrim, which covers 1.3 million patients throughout New England.
With Brophy's exit, the HMO currently has no CEO and no CFO, and is
continuing to search for a chief operating officer, a newly created
position.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond insisted that Harvard Pilgrim ``has a strong leadership
team in place. The strategy we're following is one that we believe
will produce the kind of results we're looking for. There is no
reason for anyone to be concerned about the leadership of the
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Morse, in his memo, said Brophy's duties will be assumed by
members of a transition team named on Thursday after Greenberg's
resignation. Those on the team include Morse; Dr. Gilbert Shapiro,
a board member; William Frado, general counsel; Esther Emard,
senior vice president for operations; Larry Gibson, senior vice
president for human resources and information technology; and Dr.
Joseph Dorsey, medical director. Raymond said the team will meet
for the first time on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the team's biggest tasks involves integrating its
fragmented computer systems, which were partly to blame for the
nonprofit company's larger-than-expected 1998 losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't manage what you can't measure,'' said Susan
Connolly, a principal at William M. Mercer Inc., a consulting firm
in Boston. ``Data is key to managing costs. This has been Harvard
Pilgrim's Achilles' heel.''
</P>
<P>
   Another task is to quickly find a permanent management team. A
number of names surfaced Friday among health care circles as
possible candidates, including Charles Baker, chief executive of
the Harvard Vanguard physician group that was once part of Harvard
Pilgrim. Baker would not return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is to find leadership,'' said Stephen Caulfield,
chairman of the Chickering Group, an insurance company. ``The board
has the responsibility to preserve their franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim controls roughly 38 percent of the managed care
market in Massachusetts, according to the state Division of
Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg received $656,770 in salary, benefits, and other
compensation in 1997, according to the latest public filings.
Brophy, the fourth-highest paid executive in the company that year,
received $373,315 in compensation.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When George W. Bush first ran for governor of
Texas five years ago, he had no record in politics, only a famous
name and a business career that he described as a success ``by any
objective measure.''
</P>
<P>
   In one significant way, that boast may be truer today than it
was in 1994. As Bush seeks to spring from the governorship to the
presidency, he does so with the financial security provided by his
2,359 percent gain from last year's sale of the Texas Rangers,
which transformed his $606,000 investment in the baseball team into
a $14.9 million payday.
</P>
<P>
   But the bottom line is not the only objective measure of a
business career. And closer inspection of Bush's two decades in the
private sector in Texas, which began in the oil patch in Midland
and ended in the owner's box in Arlington, suggests that his record
was mixed. While some ventures made healthy profits, others
struggled for survival. Some of his dealings raised ethical
questions that have provided fodder for political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   His business dealings also illuminate an essential question of
his biography: whether his success is primarily inherited or
achieved. It is a question that has dogged Bush, as a son of former
President George Bush, throughout his business and political
careers.
</P>
<P>
   The most sensible answer, it seems, is that Bush deserves credit
for much of his success, but that he also has benefited at critical
points from his family's prominence and the financial support of
family friends and business and political acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Bush, 52, acknowledged that his name has
generated opportunities not available to everybody, both in
business and in politics. But he asserted that he has never relied
on his name or heritage to ensure his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks to the integrity of my dad and mom, I've inherited a
great name that has sometimes opened doors and sometimes slammed
them shut,'' he said. ``But the business world is a world of
results and performance, and having a famous last name didn't
strike oil or conceive and build the Ballpark at Arlington, or help
the team's win-loss record. And my name hasn't made any decisions
for me as governor.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Bush clearly has received significant help along the
way.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving an MBA from Harvard Business School, for
instance, he started a small oil company in Midland with the
$17,000 remaining in an educational trust fund established by his
parents. Some of the most powerful businessmen in America then took
a chance on the untested oilman by investing hundreds of thousands
of dollars in his first drilling funds. Many were recruited by his
uncle, Jonathan Bush, a New York City stockbroker and brother of
the former president. When the company stagnated because of
declining market conditions and a miscalculation by George W. Bush,
it survived by merging twice with larger firms.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bush's role in the 1989 purchase of the Texas Rangers and
the attention he gained by managing the franchise that launched his
career as governor. His partners praise him for working
aggressively to secure the purchase and for making improvements,
including the construction of a graceful new stadium, that tripled
the value of the team by the time they sold it last June.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the Rangers, Bush's fortunes were aided by his
status as a first son and by the help of others. Eddie Chiles, who
sold the team to Bush's group, was a longtime friend and political
supporter of President Bush who picked George W. Bush from among
other suitors at least partly because of his deep affection for the
president, said former Arlington Mayor Richard Greene.
</P>
<P>
   And while Bush rounded up half the money used to buy the team,
the deal came together only when Peter Ueberroth, then the baseball
commissioner, personally persuaded Richard Rainwater, a prominent
Fort Worth investor, to take a major interest and join forces with
Bush. Bush had previously failed to recruit Rainwater. One source
close to those negotiations said Ueberroth had insisted that
Rainwater team up with Bush ``out of respect for his father,'' the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush graduated from Yale in 1968 and from business school in
1975. He then returned to Midland and began learning the oil
business.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of his business school classmates, Bush had
developed no real plan for his life. But his father had made his
fortune in oil, and the industry was enjoying one of its cycles of
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my instincts are toward entrepreneurship,'' Bush said,
``and I really wasn't interested in trying out the corporate
culture at that point in my life. I was single, I didn't have many
needs, and I felt that the barriers to entry were pretty darn low
in the oil business.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, oil made Bush a millionaire, and he used his profits
to build an even larger fortune in baseball. But his oil success
had far more to do with mergers than with gushers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, Bush formed Arbusto Energy Inc., ``ar-BOO-stow'' being
Spanish for ``bush.'' He began soliciting investors for annual
drilling funds that typically bought modest interests in wells
operated by other firms.
</P>
<P>
   In the company's early years, Bush's father was either running
for president or vice president or serving as vice president, and
state securities filings show that the original investors included
wealthy and prominent friends of the Bush family, corporate
chieftains, Republican leaders, Bush family members and clients of
Jonathan Bush. The list of investors was remarkable for a young
company owned by a man of 32 with scant experience and virtually no
track record.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   All of the approximately 20 business associates interviewed for
this article described Bush as astute, hardworking, affable, gritty
and honest in their dealings with him.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the first three years, Bush managed to increase the
amount invested in his oil funds, from $565,000 in 1979 to $1.7
million in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   With his company regularly mocked as ``Ar-bust-o'' and his
father serving as vice president, Bush changed the firm's name to
Bush Exploration. Then, in a major miscalculation, he decided to
sell public shares in his 1982 oil-drilling fund rather than rely
solely on private investments. The offering failed, with Bush
securing only $1.14 million of the $6 million he had sought to
raise.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the company had average luck in its drilling
ventures, but never made a major discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Bush recalls his firm as being ``a good, solid little company''
that had a positive cash flow and provided a steady return for his
limited partners. He said he believes that some at least recouped
their investments, and some verified that they had made modest
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Burned by his 1982 experience but still anxious for growth, Bush
in 1984 merged Bush Exploration with Spectrum 7 Energy Corp., a
drilling firm based in Cincinnati with an office in Midland. Bush
became chairman, chief executive and a director, with ownership of
about 15 percent of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, in 1986, world oil prices collapsed. Faced with
the prospect of laying off Spectrum's 15 employees and liquidating
its reserves, Bush and his partners decided to merge with Harken
Energy Corp., a larger conglomerate based near Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Spectrum, Harken did not give Bush a daily management
position. But it made him a director, and he received 212,152
shares of Harken stock, worth $530,380, according to SEC filings.
</P>
<P>
   On June 22, 1990, Bush sold his original 212,140 shares of
Harken stock for $4 a share, or $848,560. Eight days later, the
company finished the second quarter with a loss of $23.2 million,
more than eight times the loss it showed for the second quarter of
1989. In early August, Iraq invaded Kuwait, and within two weeks
Harken's stock fell to $3 a share. By Aug. 20, it was at $2.37 a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Bush realized that the stock's slide would raise concerns that
he had sold with insider knowledge of the yet-to-be-reported loss.
Although an outside director, he sat on an audit committee that
regularly reviewed the company's financial practices. The
suspicions were compounded when the SEC discovered it did not have
a form from Bush that insiders must file when they sell stock,
although Bush previously filed a different form that had disclosed
his intent to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Bush maintained that he had filed the missing disclosure form.
But the SEC investigated the transaction anyway. Bush's lawyer
defended him by arguing that he had not known about the impending
loss when he sold his stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the son of a president,'' Bush said. ``I was very
sensitive to the scrutiny. I felt like liquidating the stock for
personal reasons but I was also fully aware that any deal I did was
going to be fully scrutinized.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC investigators apparently were convinced by Bush's
explanation, said officials familiar with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's opponent in the 1994 gubernatorial campaign, incumbent
Gov. Ann Richards, suggested that the investigation had been a
political whitewash overseen by SEC officials appointed by Bush's
father. But SEC officials have denied any political pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In the years when Bush and William O. DeWitt Jr., a Spectrum 7
business partner, flew around the country in search of investors,
they spent much time attending baseball games and dreaming about
owning a team. In 1988, DeWitt heard that Eddie Chiles, the crusty
and conservative owner of the Texas Rangers, was looking for a
buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush returned to Texas to try to put together a deal with
Chiles, who had known the Bush family for decades. Bush quickly
collected financial commitments from a Yale classmate, the
classmate's business partner, one of his father's campaign aides
and the husband of a Bush cousin. DeWitt, meanwhile, put together a
group of Cincinnati investors.
</P>
<P>
   Bush described his role in buying the Rangers as pivotal. ``I
wasn't going to let this deal fail,'' he said. ``I wanted to put
together the group. I was tenacious.'' Many of his partners agree.
</P>
<P>
   Ueberroth is less generous. ``George W. Bush deserves great
credit for the development of the franchise,'' he said. ``However,
the bringing together of the buying group was the result of Richard
Rainwater, Rusty Rose, Dr. Bobby Brown and the commissioner.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 21, 1989, the Bush group bought 86 percent of the
Rangers for about $75 million, a price that placed the full value
of the team at $86 million. Bush's initial investment was $500,000,
which he borrowed from United Bank of Midland. He later invested
more money in the partnership, eventually bringing his total stake
to $606,302, or 1.8 percent of the team.
</P>
<P>
   To reward Bush for his role in structuring the Rangers deal and
managing the franchise, the partners agreed to grant him an
additional 10 percent share of the team once they recouped their
investments along with 2 percent interest. They also voted him a
salary of $200,000 for his full-time work as a managing general
partner.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were a success during Bush's tenure, both on the
field and in the stands. After posting losing records in six of the
seven years before the sale, the Rangers were winners in seven of
the 10 years that they were owned by the Bush group. They won
division titles in 1996 and 1998. Attendance soared dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Bush took an active role in the team's management. He also
became one of its most popular ambassadors, giving speeches,
chatting up reporters, negotiating television contracts,
representing the team at league meetings and signing autographs.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest improvement for the Rangers was the construction of
the Ballpark at Arlington, a 47,000-seat stadium with old-fashioned
elegance and plenty of revenue-producing sky boxes. Bush helped
conceive the design of the stadium, and supported the notion of
financing its construction through a half-cent increase in
Arlington's sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   With other cities in the Dallas-Fort Worth area eager to steal
the team, Arlington officials quickly signed on to the tax increase
and then joined with the Rangers in selling the measure to voters.
Bush helped plot strategy for the referendum campaign but kept a
low profile. With Bush's father in the White House, the Rangers did
not want the politics of the new stadium to become partisan. Bush
critics speculate that the aspiring politician also did not want to
be closely associated with a tax increase. Early in 1991, the tax
referendum passed by a margin of nearly 2-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the stadium arrangement call it the most egregious
form of corporate welfare and argue that the tax increase stands in
contrast to Bush's anti-tax politics. He responds that Arlington
voters made their own decision. On April 15, 1999, Bush reported
that he and his wife, Laura, paid $3.8 million in federal income
taxes for 1998 on estimated taxable income of $18.4 million. Their
annual income had averaged $416,703 in the previous seven years.

 &HT;    Florida `War of the Theme Parks' escalates
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ He's only a mouse, but they're bringing in the
Super Heroes to battle him, along with Jurassic Park's dinosaurs
and even that tongue-twisting Cat-in-the-Hat.
</P>
<P>
   Kids from Sao Paulo to St. Paul are surely celebrating as
Universal Studios Escape this month unveils its second major theme
park, Islands of Adventure, a $1 billion array of high tech roller
coasters and movie rides.
</P>
<P>
   The much-ballyhooed debut marks a new phase in Orlando's
ever-escalating War of the Theme Parks, in which entertainment
giants spend billions in a fight for the almighty tourist dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando now boasts a mind-boggling seven major theme parks, not
to mention the dozens of smaller water parks, dinner theaters,
video shoot-em-ups, animal attractions and other venues.
</P>
<P>
   But the landscape is dominated by the Big Three _ Universal,
SeaWorld, and the granddaddy of all family vacation destinations,
Walt Disney World. Disney still towers over all others, with four
major theme parks, 26 resort hotels, three water parks and two
entertainment/shopping districts on its sprawling, city-sized
property.
</P>
<P>
   But Universal appears determined to catch up, and even SeaWorld
is joining the expansion game, recently announcing plans for its
first-ever high-speed roller coaster and a new
swim-with-the-dolphins venue.
</P>
<P>
   It's all enough to keep starry-eyed youngsters dragging their
parents back to Orlando year after year until they reach adulthood,
when suddenly they'll find themselves on the pulling end of little
hands headed for excitement.
</P>
<P>
   And that is exactly what theme park planners count on.
</P>
<P>
   60 million tourists
</P>
<P>
   The only cloud marring the postcard-perfect vacation landscape
is the nagging question: Just how many theme parks is too many
theme parks? When does a market even as seemingly infinite as
Orlando's reach saturation?
</P>
<P>
   No time soon, apparently.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will see some cannibalization with attendance flat or
dropping at some parks for the next year or two, but I don't think
there's any doubt the tourism demand will catch up with the
supply,'' said Tim O'Brien, who tracks the theme park industry for
``Amusement Business,'' a trade magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison Price, an industry consultant who helps theme parks
answer just that question, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a study several years ago in that market and didn't find
saturation at that point,'' he said. ``What they've done is create
the world's top tourism destination. Years ago the people who went
there for the parks might visit one or two in a week's vacation.
Now they're visiting four or five.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, worry that Central Florida's heavy dependence on
tourism is creating an unsteady economic base, built on thousands
of low-paying theme park and tourism service jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're in a bit of a trap,'' said Richard Foglesong, a
Rollins College politics professor who is writing a book about
Disney's impact on the area. ``We've created an infrastructure that
is drawing more tourism here, but tourism is primarily low-wage
jobs. It's a shaky foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the bandwagon shows no sign of slowing down. Last year,
Orlando's 80-plus attractions tallied a staggering 60 million in
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists seem to love the place, although ask when they're
sitting in the shade and not waiting in some long line with
screaming kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no place like Florida,'' said Malcolm Dalgleish, 49,
of Newcastle, England, who recently took his third Orlando
vacation. ``If they open another one, we'll just have to come back
again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident that we've got the best product this market
has to offer,'' said Tom Williams, Universal's president. ``I think
the market continues to grow and I'm confident that we'll get our
share.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurassic Park and Bullwinkle
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Universal drew nearly 9 million visitors, a number
its executives hope to surpass quickly with the addition of Islands
of Adventure. The park will feature several separate venues,
including a Jurassic Park island based on the Steven Spielberg
movie, a Super Hero island featuring Spiderman and other Marvel
Comics characters, a Dr. Seuss landing and Toon Lagoon, populated
by beloved cartoon favorites like Rocky, Bullwinkle, Popeye and
Dudley DooRight.
</P>
<P>
   But Universal's plans don't stop there. Taking a page from
Disney's book, executives want to keep the visitors _ and their
money _ on the property for their entire vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's first on-property hotel, Portofino Bay, opens this
September, to be followed by four others in the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   Already open is CityWalk, a shopping/entertainment district that
competes with Downtown Disney and Pleasure Island. Add to that
Wet'n Wild, a nearby water park that Universal purchased last year,
which answers Disney's Typhoon Lagoon and Blizzard Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Even more expansion could come down the road. Last year,
Universal bought 1,900 acres near its current location.
</P>
<P>
   For all its growth, though, Universal still lags Disney in sheer
size. Its 840 acres under current development and plans for 20,000
employees pales compared to Disney's 25,000-acre complex employing
some 50,000 full-time and seasonal workers.
</P>
<P>
   Disney has never strayed from its original plan to build an
entertainment complex that would be ever-changing and expanding.
Last year it opened its fourth theme park, Animal Kingdom, which
competes directly with SeaWorld and Busch Gardens in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Disney continues upgrading existing attractions,
while adding new ones, such as Cirque du Soleil; a new track where
people pretend to be Detroit car testers; a Buzz Lightyear
video-game ride; a new roller coaster and several new live shows.
The company is also adding its second cruise ship, based in nearby
Port Canaveral. If Universal is a growing challenger, Disney seems
determined to hold onto its franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish them the best,'' said Disney spokesman Craig Dezern.
``But we're focused on what has been a year of explosive growth. We
keep focused on giving our guests something new and exciting each
time they visit.''
</P>
<P>
   Smaller parks scrambling
</P>
<P>
   If anybody is getting left behind in the rush, it would have to
be the smaller parks.
</P>
<P>
   At Gatorland, a 50-year-old attraction just south of Orlando,
the challenge has meant expanding constantly, adding new shows and
renovating existing facilities.
</P>
<P>
   But simply keeping up seems to be getting harder all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not bleak, but the little guys are concerned,'' said Tim
Williams, Gatorland's spokesman. ``Some of us are really
scrambling. At some point you do reach saturation, and it's
probably the little guys who will be hurting.''
</P>
<P>
   University of Central Florida economist David Scott cites
another worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk is that we haven't had a recession since 1990-1991,''
said Scott, who also believes hoteliers may be over-building,
citing dropping occupancy rates the past two years. ``The business
decision-makers are gambling, but I don't think many of them
realize what an unusual time we're in. This is the 99th month of
this economic expansion, and the longest one on record is 106
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if there is no economic downturn, some believe the Orlando
juggernaut will eventually reach a point of saturation.
</P>
<P>
   Industry consultant Price says it could happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``How far you can push it, I don't think anybody knows,'' he
said.

`IT'S GOOD TO STEP BACK INTO TEXAS,' SAYS FORMER POW 

</HEADLINE>
 -HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ ``Wow. Hey everybody. It's good to step back into
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Those were the first words of Army Spc. Steven Gonzales when he
arrived here Friday on a flight from Germany three days after being
released from prison in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old Huntsville, Texas, cavalry scout, dressed in a
blue and white sweat suit, declined to discuss details of his
capture on the Macedonia border or the month he spent as a prisoner
of the Serbs. He told a throng of reporters and a handful of
relatives who met him at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport,
``I'm looking forward to a little bit of rest. It's great to be
free, but it's a little bit stressful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson negotiated the release of Gonzales and
two other American soldiers last weekend. After three days of
medical examinations and military debriefings, all returned to the
United States Friday. Gonzales' parents, Gilbert and Rosie
Gonzales, and his aunt, Rosie Barrow, accompanied him on the flight
from Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   During the 32 days he was a prisoner, Gonzales said, ``Isolation
was a big factor'' and he filled the time ``with a lot of prayer, a
lot of thoughts of family and all the happy memories I could think
of.''
</P>
<P>
   He described spending his 22nd birthday as a prisoner of war as
``depressing,'' but, in retrospect, he added, ``I spent my birthday
in a place few people have had an opportunity to spend their
birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   From Dallas, Gonzales and his family left for an undisclosed
location for a few days of rest before returning to Huntsville,
where he will be honored with a parade and activities at Sam
Houston State University on May 22.
</P>
<P>
   As Gonzalez and his parents were en route, the Pentagon released
the first substantive details of the capture of the three soldiers.
Gonzales, Staff Sgts. Christopher Stone, 25, of Michigan, and
Andrew Ramirez, 24, of California were on a training mission March
31 near the Macedonia-Yugoslavia border when their Humvee was
surrounded by Serb soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were pulled from their Humvee and they were kicked,
punched and hit with rifle butts and treated extremely roughly,''
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said, according to The Associated
Press. ``There were also periods of harsh treatment during
interrogation in the days following their capture.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon did not reveal details of the harsh prison treatment.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Army has concluded ``beyond a shadow of a doubt''
that the three soldiers were on the Macedonia side of the border,
not on the Yugoslav side as the government of Slobodan Milosevic
claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said the three were armed with a .50-caliber machine gun,
one M-16 rifle and two side arms but did not fire them because they
were outnumbered by Serb soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the machine gun) was not ready to go because typically
when you drive around you don't have the thing ready to fire,'' he
said. The soldier manning the machine gun ``followed the normal
rule of getting out of the line of fire so he wouldn't be shot,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to evade their captors, Bacon said, they ran the Humvee
into a ditch or some obstacle, ``which made it difficult for them
to get away.''

 &HT;    Civic Si worthy successor of CRX
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Car shoppers today who start out thinking of the
venerable Honda Civic as a bastion of practical and reliable _ but
unexciting _ transportation are going to find dealerships
delightedly offering them a quick reality check. It's the new Civic
Si, a truly worthy successor of the recently departed CRX and the
Si models of the early and mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Its looks are, well, ordinary. No flashy graphics. No rakish
color schemes. No eye-grabbing, boy-racer rear spoiler. About all
that stands out is the relatively small lettering ``VTEC'' below
the beltline and just in front of the rear wheel wells.
</P>
<P>
   What that means is that Honda, catering to the enthusiasts _ the
younger ones in particular _ dropped its potent little 1.6-liter
four-cylinder engine with variable valve timing and lift electronic
control (VTEC) into the 2,600-pound Civic Si. That makes it a
little monster with 160 horsepower and 111 pounds-feet of torque
coming from an engine that redlines at 8,000 rpm.
</P>
<P>
   AutoWeek calls it ``the pocket rocket of our time.'' The West
Coast, where car crazies proliferate, calls it the current next big
thing. Honda gleefully reports that young women and men are so
devoted to pepping up and personalizing their Civic Si coupes that
Oscar Jackson of Jackson Racing tags it ``the '57 Chevy of the
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   A reality check here is that Frank Bohanan, tech director of the
Specialty Equipment Market Association, says Hondas are ``the most
popular cars'' among buyers looking for relatively inexpensive cars
to customize.
</P>
<P>
   Civics start at $10,650 for a CX hatchback and run through a
variety of coupe and sedan models with manual and automatic
transmissions before getting to the Si coupe. It lists for $17,445,
and there isn't much missing in the way of equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Bypass the dealer-installed floor mats, and buyers can drive
away in a Civic Si like the ``electron blue'' test car for $17,860
(plus tag, taxes, etc.). It came with air conditioning, a strong
stereo with CD player and six speakers, the expected power
equipment and, yes, drink holders. Neat features included a locking
fold-down rear seat, smallish but solid front seats, a supple
shifter and the tachometer that conservatively redlines at 8,000
rpm.
</P>
<P>
   That's the Civic Si's best feature, of course _ the
smooth-revving VTEC engine. It does prefer premium fuel, but the
EPA figures (26 and 31 mpg) are respectable, and its performance is
rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   The ride, it should be noted, is enthusiast-oriented, meaning
the Civic Si resists body lean and roll and feels surprisingly
stable for a car of its size. Anti-lock brakes, unfortunately,
aren't standard, although they should be on a car that targets
enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   Driven responsibly, though, the Civic Si is a rewarding ride,
one that mates non-overwhelming performance with good standard
features and plenty of potential for personalizing.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 1999 Honda Civic Si front-drive coupe
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $17,860 (includes delivery, base price:
$17,445)
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual air bags, side-impact beams
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine with 16 valves (160
horsepower), five-speed manual overdrive transmission
</P>
<P>
   Options on test vehicle: none
</P>
<P>
   Standard features include: air conditioning, six-speaker stereo
with CD player, power windows and locks, power moonroof, keyless
entry system
</P>

   UNITED NATIONS _ After being relegated to near-irrelevance in a
series of conflicts from Iraq to the Balkans, the United Nations
moved to reclaim center stage Friday, answering for now critics who
have said it was fading into diplomatic insignificance.
</P>
<P>
   UN Secretary General Kofi Annan appointed two prominent European
envoys, former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt and Slovakian
Foreign Miniser Eduard Kukan, to step up the organization's
diplomatic activities in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Annan also ordered a small advance team team to leave for
Belgrade Sunday to pave the way for a 15-member team that hopes to
head for Kosovo a week later to assess humanitarian needs in the
ravaged province. Annan also said he has been mulling a personal
visit to Belgrade to meet with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United Nations is indispensable,'' Annan said. ``And
whether we like it or not, on certain global issues, this is the
only organization. And sooner or later we have to turn to it. I
hope in the future we will do it sooner rather than later.''
</P>
<P>
   The world body got a boost last week from a proposal for ending
the Kosovo conflict that Russia and the major Western powers agreed
to Thursday. The deal was a diplomatic advance for Moscow and
Belgrade, which have been pressing for a larger UN role. It also
provides the US and its NATO allies with the prospect of UN
sanction for any ultimate political settlement.
</P>
<P>
   While it remains unlikely that the US would agree to putting
NATO troops in the region under UN command, there is now agreement
in Washington and Moscow that any peacekeeping role will require
approval of the UN Security Council. And the world body is expected
to play a role in overseeing the creation of a transitional
government in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``This statement brings the United Nations into a greater
post-conflict role than it played in Bosnia,'' said Ivo Daalder,
the former top Balkans expert at the National Security Council.
``And it reestablishes the importance of UN legitimacy, if not in
going to war, at least in how you build a peace.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, some observers and diplomats have decried what
they saw as the growing irrelevance of the United Nations. Its role
in international peacekeeping had been scaled back following
troubled operations from Somalia to Angola, where the United
Nations withdrew after a $1 million-a-day peacekeeping failed to
stop a decades-long civil war.
</P>
<P>
   On March 24, the US and its NATO allies bypassed the UN Security
Council as they launched the greatest offensive military operation
since the birth of the alliance 50 years ago. Faced with a certain
Russian veto in the Security Council, American and European
diplomats argued that they were justified in acting by the need to
halt a looming humanitarian calamity.
</P>
<P>
   But six weeks of a punishing NATO air campaign have failed to
prevent the expulsion of ethnic Albanians by Serbian forces or to
pressure Milosevic to accept NATO troops in Kosovo to guarantee the
Albanians' right to return and to a degree of self-government. NATO
has stepped up its air campaign in recent days, but the Clinton
Administration has also increased its contacts with Russia to find
a diplomatic solution to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Thursday by Russia and the Group of Seven
industrial powers, the United States acceded to Russia's demand
that a key role in a postwar settlement for the UN Security
Council, where Moscow enjoys veto power. The United States also
agreed to omit the mention of NATO from the statement, although US
officials insisted that NATO would play a central role in any
international force.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has been pressing for the UN chief to take a more active
role in mediating the conflict. On Monday, Moscow's chief peace
envoy, former Prime Minsiter Viktor Chernomyrdin, asked Annan to
travel on a peace mission to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Annan, who pledged to work closely with the Russians, said
Friday that he won't rule out a visit to the Serb capital when the
time is right.
</P>
<P>
   Vladislav Jovanovic, Yugoslavia's ambassador to the United
Nations, said in an interview that his government first invited
Annan on Oct. 1. Jovanivic said Annan has been ``evasive'' about
his plans.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade prefers a peacekeeping role for the United Nations,
which is likely to field a less heavily armed force than NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Jovanovic said the UN humanitarian mission has not yet been
granted access to Kosovo by Yugoslav authorities, and any UN effort
would have to address the needs of Serb victims of the NATO bombing
campaign as well the situation of displaced ethnic Albanians still
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The UN's reputation ``was very seriously damaged by the act of
NATO,'' said Jovanovic. ``Only the speedy recovery of its role can
save the UN from repeating the fate of the League of Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan acknowledged that his diplomatic intervention carried
risks for the organization, whose reputation has been badly
tarnished by diplomatic setbacks from Angola to Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are high for the governments involved,'' Annan
said. ``The stakes are high for the United Nations, too.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An academic center being built at the University of
Mississippi and named for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott is
being endowed with million-dollar donations from companies with
huge stakes in pending congressional legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In less than six months of fund raising, university officials
say they have collected pledges for more than half of the $8
million they hope to raise for the Trent Lott Leadership Institute,
which is scheduled to open next year. Among the donors are MCI
Worldcom Inc. and Lockheed Martin Corp., each of which has pledged
$1 million. The companies are on opposite sides of a legislative
battle over Lockheed's planned acquisition of a giant satellite
company.
</P>
<P>
   In two weeks, at a Kennedy Center gala honoring Lott, still more
money for the center will be raised. One of the principal
fund-raisers for the event is Haley Barbour, another prominent
Mississippi Republican, who is also one of the most powerful
lobbyists in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Given Lott's importance in Mississippi and Washington, it isn't
surprising that the university has had so little trouble finding
backers for its new leadership institute.
</P>
<P>
   But observant students of government may well divine an
additional lesson: that money follows politicians to a surprising
number of places, and that individuals and corporations have ways
above and beyond direct campaign contributions _ and the legally
mandated limits on those donations _ to make politicians feel
loved.
</P>
<P>
   While this type of fund raising for academic centers honoring
powerful politicians is not new, the Lott institute has drawn
unusually heavy corporate support _ all of it wholly
tax-deductible.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, these types of academic centers seem to be
multiplying; at least five additional current senators have such
institutions named after them, a manner of tribute once reserved
for the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Several political analysts said this trend raises the troubling
specter that monied individuals and companies are plying new
avenues to purchase influence. Unlike campaign donations,
contributions to these centers do not have to be publicly disclosed
to the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having temples built to yourself while you're still in power
is a very dangerous proposition,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president
of Democracy 21, a public policy group. ``It's very pleasant for
the honoree, and very dangerous for citizens who are looking for a
fair political process.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for MCI and Lockheed said that the companies' gifts
were intended solely to promote education and noted that all of the
money goes to the University of Mississippi, not to Lott.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, in a prepared statement, said, ``The only thing
benefactors will be `buying' with their gifts are the desks, books
and other materials to help students in this new Ole Miss
program.''
</P>
<P>
   Although university officials said that they would publicize the
names of all of their donors in the program for the gala, they said
they did not want to disclose contributors yet without their
consent. But they did identify the sources of their three largest
gifts so far.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to MCI and Lockheed, J.L. Holloway, who runs a
company in Mississippi that manufactures equipment for offshore oil
drilling, also gave $1 million. Although that company, Friede
Goldman International, could also be affected by federal
legislation, it does not have an armada of lobbyists comparable to
those employed by MCI and Lockheed.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway said his donation was a personal recognition of Lott's
achievements. ``I think Senator Lott is one of those very unusual
and special leaders that only come by once in a lifetime,''
Holloway said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the publication Roll Call reported that the tobacco
company Brown and Williamson had given $50,000 to the institute,
but several calls to the company Friday were not returned. A
spokesman for AT&AMP;T said that it had made a contribution, too, but
would not disclose the amount.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Mississippi, like any large university, has
its own interests in federal policy. But like other schools with
programs or centers named for politicians, it benefits most
immediately by a politician's _ and especially Lott's _ ability to
attract money.
</P>
<P>
   University officials said that the Lott institute will offer a
special curriculum in leadership and be housed in a renovated
dormitory on the university's main campus in Oxford, Miss. The
officials stressed that Lott had not been directly involved in the
fund raising and that both the center and its name were their idea.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Khayat, the university's chancellor, said that Lott has
self-effacingly tried to play down the honor. ``He would not allow
the gala to be scheduled unless it honored all of Mississippi
leadership,'' Khayat said. ``He didn't want it to be about him.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raising event, for which there are 2,200 tickets at
$1,500 apiece, is indeed titled ``A Celebration of Mississippi
Leadership,'' and it will use film clips to pay tribute to famous
writers from Mississippi, like William Faulkner and Eudora Welty,
and famous entertainers from Mississippi, like the opera singer
Leontyne Price and the jazz singer B.B. King.
</P>
<P>
   But it will culminate in an appearance onstage by Lott and a
performance of the musical quartet to which he belongs, the Singing
Senators. University officials said they expected to sell all of
the available seats.
</P>
<P>
   Gala sponsors MCI and Lockheed could be greatly affected by
legislation pending in the Senate that sets the terms for the
privatization of Intelsat and Inmarsat, two international satellite
systems to which Comsat Corp. has exclusive access for the United
States. Lockheed is in the process of acquiring Comsat.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications companies like MCI and AT&AMP;T would like the
legislation to allow them to renegotiate long-term contracts with
Comsat and give them their own access to Intelsat and Inmarsat.
Lockheed opposes such amendments to the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   A bill passed by the Senate Commerce committee on Wednesday did
not give MCI and other telecommunications companies what they
wanted, but they continue to lobby Lott and other senators for more
favorable provisions, which could save them tens of millions of
dollars annually and reduce Lockheed's earnings by an even larger
amount.
</P>
<P>
   James Fetig, a spokesman for Lockheed, which has its
headquarters in Bethesda, Md., said that the corporation's $1
million gift, to be paid over five years, was in line with the sums
it gives other educational institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trent Lott's leadership position or any other legislation
pending before the Congress is not related to this decision,''
Fetig said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Walter, a spokesman for MCI, which has its headquarters in
Jackson, Miss., said that the company was simply continuing its
longtime support of its home state's schools.

   While corporations themselves cannot give campaign contributions
to a politician and the political action committees affiliated with
corporations are limited to donations of $5,000 per election, there
is no limit to the charitable contributions made to an institution
or foundation associated with a politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has increasingly become standard operating procedure in
the world of politics,'' said Brian Moir, a telecommunications
lawyer. ``If you can't contribute directly, you contribute to
activities that members of Congress hold dear.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Lott's, the names of other sitting senators who
have been engraved on school buildings, programs or libraries,
include Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.; Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.; Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., and Conrad Burns, R-Mont. Former Sen. John Glenn,
D-Ohio, an astronaut, also has an academic center at Ohio State
University named after him.
</P>
<P>
   Burns' namesake, christened by Montana State University in 1997,
is the Burns Telecommunications Center, which promotes the
education of students who live off campus and commute via telephone
lines, modems and computers. According to an official at the
center, several telecommunications firms contributed to the center.
</P>
<P>
   Burns is chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee's
communications subcommittee.

 &HT;    Coke argues it can communicate with all employees
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Co. said Friday it has the right to
communicate with all employees about a racial discrimination
lawsuit, rejecting allegations by plaintiffs that it violated a
federal court rule when it sent e-mails to salaried black
employees.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the plaintiffs' attempt to get a court order to
prevent the company from communicating with potential members of a
class-action suit promotes discrimination, the company said in its
first legal response in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relief plaintiffs seek would impose an unconstitutional
prior restraint on Coca-Cola's right to free speech, require
Coca-Cola to segregate and discriminate against its own employees _
the very employees plaintiffs seek to represent _ and punish
Coca-Cola for having African-American employees in positions of
significant authority,'' the company told the judge in its written
response.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, one former and three current Coca-Cola employees
filed suit in U.S. District Court in Atlanta, alleging the company
systematically discriminated against African-Americans in pay,
promotions, performance evaluations and terminations. The
plaintiffs are seeking class-action status for their suit so they
can represent 1,500 salaried black employees of Coca-Cola in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Then last week, the plaintiffs said company Chairman and Chief
Executive M. Douglas Ivester violated a court rule by sending two
e-mails about the lawsuit to all 10,000 U.S. employees, including
African-Americans. The plaintiffs' attorneys contend that Ivester
had no right to communicate with potential members of a
class-action suit without prior court approval, which he did not
seek.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the plaintiffs' attorneys want the court to stop
Ivester or any other company official from communicating about the
suit with the salaried black employees who might become plaintiffs
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   But Coca-Cola argued Friday that case law requires evidence the
company abused employees' rights before the court can limit its
communication with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absent specific findings of abuse, Coca-Cola is entitled to
communicate openly and honestly with its employees, including
prospective class members, in order to conduct its business and
defend itself against this lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Richard Story will hold a hearing next
Thursday on this issue. The plaintiffs' attorneys had no comment
Friday on Coca-Cola's response to their motion.

JOHN PAUL II MAKES HISTORIC VISIT TO ROMANIA 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BUCHAREST, Romania _ Fulfilling a dream long denied, John Paul
II arrived in Romania Friday for the first visit of a pope to a
predominantly Orthodox country.
</P>
<P>
   Reveling in the symbolism, the pope drove up to the Orthodox
Cathedral in his glass-encased white jeep with Patriarch Teoctist
of the Romanian Orthodox Church at his side, both of them in white
vestments and smiling broadly. It was the first time that a
non-Catholic religious leader has ridden shoulder to shoulder with
the pope inside the pope mobile. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I kissed the ground with great emotion, grateful most of all
to God who in his benevolence allowed me to see this desire
realized,'' the pope said at the airport, where the patriarch
greeted him with a kiss. The two leaders later prayed side by side
at the Orthodox Cathedral, amid icons, incense and the chanting of
an Orthodox choir. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For this pope, who 20 years ago first expressed his hopes of
mending the breach between the Catholic and Orthodox churches
before the end of the second millennium, the trip has a haunting
resonance. On the eve of the year 2000, the aging pope's three-day
visit is a historic step that nevertheless falls short of his early
aim of full reconciliation between East and West. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His delight was evident, but his carefully curtailed schedule in
Bucharest also underscored the deep divisions that have kept
Catholic and Orthodox Christians apart since the schism of 1054. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pope himself referred to the most recent tensions between
the Orthodox Church and Romania's Greek-Catholic church, which
follows Eastern rites but is loyal to Rome. Both suffered under
communism, but Catholics, seen as less compliant by the regime,
were persecuted mercilessly, and their church property was given
over to the Orthodox church. Now, the churches are locked in a
bitter battle over the return of confiscated property.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that my visit will help heal the wounds inflicted on
the relationship between our churches during the past 50 years,''
the pope said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those troubles, moreover, have been inflamed by the bombing
campaign next door, where Orthodox Serbs are at war with NATO. In
the eyes of at least some Orthodox leaders, the West is not just
attacking the political regime in Belgrade, it is also undermining
a rival Christian church. In his visit, John Paul II is seeking to
allay deep-seated mistrust among Orthodox Christians at a time when
their faith in their fellow Christians is daily tested by the war
in Yugoslavia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Patriarch Teoctist on Friday suggested a joint effort to end
that conflict, telling the pope, ``you fight against the spirit of
secularization and you work for the reconciliation of peoples, and
that is why we hope the presence of your holiness will be a good
occasion to bring a common testimony to the drama of Yugoslavia _ a
territory placed in the middle of Christian Europe _ by asking
together for an immediate halt to the war.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The patriarch praised the visit's importance, but he also
pointed out its limits. ``We hope this visit will deepen and
reinforce our efforts of dialogue,'' the patriarch told reporters.
``This moment represents one effort among others. This is easier
than the theological effort,'' he added dryly, ``because
theologians always complicate things.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He referred to the pope's presence as an ``essentially
ecumenical visit.'' The Vatican, however, described it as a
pastoral visit, in which the pope could also minister to his
Catholic flock. The Orthodox church has sought to minimize that
aspect, insisting that the pope remain in Bucharest and not travel
to Transylvania, where most Romanian Catholics live, and where
tensions are particularly high. (In one incident last year, the two
sides came to blows inside a contested cathedral, overturning the
altar.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Orthodox church is made up of 15 autonomous denominations
with 300 million members, most of whom are in Eastern Europe. More
than 80 percent of Romania's population of 23 million is Orthodox. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The main issue separating Orthodox Christians and Catholics is
the authority of the pope. Orthodoxy rejects the Catholic belief in
his primacy and his infallibility on matters of faith and morals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Romania's was the only Orthodox Church to extend the pope an
invitation, and it did so under considerable pressure from
President Emil Constantinescu. To the Romanian government, which
wants to join NATO to help its painful transition to democracy
after the overthrow of the communist dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu, a
papal visit is an important symbol of membership in the West.

 BUCHAREST, Romania: the West. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the Orthodox church's conditions for the pope's visit was
that the Catholic church drop all civil suits to reclaim lost
property and allow a church commission to settle the dispute. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that the pope's visit inspired concessions on
the Orthodox side as well. Last last month, Metropolitan Nicolae
Corneanu of Timisoara gave an interview to an Italian Catholic
magazine and apologized for his own collaboration with the
Communist regime, and for not helping his persecuted Catholic
colleagues. Metropolitan Nicolae is one of the few Orthodox bishops
in Romania who has willingly returned Greek-Catholic churches in
his diocese. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The patriarch, who was accused of collaboration with the
Communist government, resigned after the Ceausescu regime was
overthrown in 1989 and entered a monastery. Three months later,
church leaders pressed him to return. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The property dispute is veined with centuries-old grievances,
which include Orthodox fears that the Greek-Catholic church is
seeking new converts and, because of its links to Rome, is a
better-financed, more powerful rival. Such suspicions are widely
shared throughout the Orthodox world, despite a pledge made by the
pope in 1991 that the Catholic Church would not seek to convert
Orthodox Christians. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the pope repeated his desire to visit Moscow.
But Patriarch Aleksei II has declined to meet with him, citing
unresolved disputes with Rome.

   ``One of the manifestations of the divide between the churches
of the East and West has been the Eastern-rite Catholics,'' said
the Rev. Leonid Kishkovsky, ecumenical officer of the Russian
Orthodox Church in America. ``Many Orthodox see these churches as a
kind of Trojan horse, a deceptive way for Rome to extend its reach
into the East. Those feelings are very powerful among many Orthodox
believers.''

<P>
   The pope, who on Saturday plans to celebrate a Catholic mass and
visit a cemetery where Greek-Catholics who were persecuted by the
Communists are buried, also met privately with Catholic bishops in
Bucharest today. He told them that it would be ``just'' to return
some church property, but also warned that it would be difficult
for the Greek-Catholic church to regain everything it lost in
1948. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pope's efforts to reconcile Catholics and Orthodox
Christians is part of an edgy process of rapprochement which began
in 1965, when the two churches annulled their mutual
excommunication edicts, in force since 1054. Vatican Council II
made ecumenical dialogue between East and West even more of a
priority. But those changes in Rome's thinking are not always as
apparent to religious leaders in Romania as they are to their
Western counterparts. ``The new attitudes that came out of Vatican
II all happened when Romanians were trapped behind the Iron
Curtain,'' the Rev. Robert Roberson, author of ``The Eastern
Christian Churches,'' explained. ``There is still a lot of
catching-up to do.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the pope set out to charm his Orthodox hosts. Before
delivering a speech in Romanian, the pope beamed at his audience
and, speaking in French, recalled his first words to Italian
believers after he was elected pope. ``This is what I said: `If I
make any mistakes, you'll correct me,' '' he said. ``I would like
to repeat the same words here, all the more so as I am even less
prepared to speak Romanian.'' The Orthodox bishops responded with
laughter and applause.

KOSOVAR WELCOME WEARS THIN IN ALBANIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ The police, waving guns, burst into a downtown
hotel while the Kosovar Albanians were eating lunch, telling the
Kosovars they had five minutes to collect their things and file
onto buses.
</P>
<P>
   For the refugees, who were welcomed six weeks earlier by their
Albanian cousins, eviction at gunpoint seemed all too familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were worse than the Serbs,'' said Selim Ferizaj, 22, one
of about 300 refugees evicted from the state-run Hotel Arbana this
month. ``We didn't know Albanian police were like that. We thought
they loved us.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a year after the first refugees began the mountainous
trek from Kosovo to safety here, the welcome mat graciously laid
out by local Albanians is wearing thin.
</P>
<P>
   Albanians at first said they would eagerly take in their ``blood
brothers'' _ the Kosovar Albanians _ and share their meager food
supplies with them. But with cash running short and the number of
refugees growing exponentially, locals say they cannot continue to
support the Kosovars. Some are even gouging the refugees with high
prices for food and continued lodging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they didn't expect the invasion,'' said refugee Dritan
Cena, 27, who was bused to a squalid camp after being thrown out of
another downtown hotel. ``Maybe they were ready for 10,000 or
20,000, but not a half-million people.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugees began filing into Albania last year, escaping the
fighting between the Kosovo Liberation Army and the Yugoslav
military. But since the Serbs' program of forced expulsion went
into overdrive after the NATO bombing began in March, more than
400,000 people have flooded Albania _ tired, homeless, and often
ill.
</P>
<P>
   Aid organizations estimate that the number of refugees entering
Europe's poorest nation may reach 1 million _ resulting in a 30
percent increase in Albania's population of 3.2 million. Many
Kosovars are coming from neighboring Macedonia, which has balked at
taking more Kosovars, and from Montenegro, a politically unstable
republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovar refugees are extremely visible in Tirana, drying their
clothes on bushes and sleeping in public parks. Refugee centers
take up almost every empty public building in Tirana, and parks and
parking lots have turned into filthy tent cities.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovars complain that the Albanians are trying to gouge them on
housing and transportation. In a nation where the average monthly
wage is $106, landlords are demanding $250 a month and more for
tiny apartments. Sinbad Sadiku, 30, is paying for two such
apartments to house his extended family, and said he had to fork
over $240 to a driver to take his family, among them his diabetic
mother who nearly died while fleeing Kosovo, from the border town
of Kukes to Tirana.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't believe us, that the Serbs took all our money''
when they forced the Kosovars to march to Albania, Sadiku said.
</P>
<P>
   Old resentments and jealousies are also fueling the tension
between the locals and the refugees. The Kosovar Albanians have
long been wealthier, better educated, and better traveled than the
Albanians, who for a half-century lived under the most repressive
regime in the communist bloc, that of dictator Enver Hoxha.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rule of longtime Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito,
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo enjoyed a more open society and
political autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Albanians are beginning to resent helping out their
``rich'' brothers, Sadiku said. ``We are one blood, but they only
look to take money from us,'' Ferizaj said.
</P>
<P>
   Local Albanians say the Albanian and Western governments are not
doing enough to help the host families.
</P>
<P>
   In Fier, about 100 miles south of Tirana, 12 Kosovar families
who had been staying with host families have moved back into the
overcrowded refugee collection center because the families could
not carry the burden any longer, said Vahide Majad, director of the
Kino Teatri refugee center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government said they would give 100 leke (about 75 cents)
per person per day, but they haven't even done that,'' Majad said.
``So we are taking them here and then to the camps. What else can
we do?''
</P>
<P>
   Zyrafete Axhanela has just a week more with a host family in
Fier before she will be asked to leave. ``I don't know where I will
go _ maybe to the street,'' Axhanela said, holding back tears as
she sat among her dirty, threadbare belongings in a Fier park.
</P>
<P>
   Aristidh Theka, manager of the Arbana, said the $20-a-night
hotel had to evict the refugee families because ``we would have
been bankrupt'' if they had stayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't happy about it, but what could we do?'' he said.
``The Albanians are in a very bad situation, made worse because
they took in refugees. In my opinion, someone must care for the
Albanian families'' who are taking in refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Theka denied that the police forced refugees to leave _ an
account disputed by a half-dozen refugees who said the group of
several hundred was rounded up and sent to the Mullet camp, about 6
miles from Tirana.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sick, so I was sitting down'' at the hotel, said Shahe
Kukaj, 38. ``The police said, `What are you doing here? Get on the
bus.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, `At the beginning, you treated us well, but at
the end, you force us to leave, like the Serbs,' '' said Kukaj, who
is staying at the Mullet camp.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian officials say the cash-strapped government cannot
reimburse families who have taken refugees into their homes. ``We
don't yet have a solution for the host families,'' said Arben
Malaj, a legislator. He said host families tend to be Albania's
poorest households, often made up of two retired people.
</P>
<P>
   Some families, however, are struggling to support refugee guests
and say they will not throw them out on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an expression _ space is space, water is water, and
bread is bread _ they belong to everyone,'' said Petrit Knuti, an
engineer who has taken a Kosovar family of five into his home. ``We
will never ask them to leave. The poorest the person, the bigger
the heart.''

UN MOVES TO SEIZE INITIATIVE IN YUGSLAV PEACE EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ After being relegated to near-irrelevance in a
series of conflicts from Iraq to the Balkans, the United Nations
moved to reclaim center stage Friday, answering for now critics who
have said it was fading into diplomatic insignificance.
</P>
<P>
   UN Secretary General Kofi Annan appointed two prominent European
envoys, former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt and Slovakian
Foreign Miniser Eduard Kukan, to step up the organization's
diplomatic activities in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Annan also ordered a small advance team team to leave for
Belgrade Sunday to pave the way for a 15-member team that hopes to
head for Kosovo a week later to assess humanitarian needs in the
ravaged province. Annan also said he has been mulling a personal
visit to Belgrade to meet with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United Nations is indispensable,'' Annan said. ``And
whether we like it or not, on certain global issues, this is the
only organization. And sooner or later we have to turn to it. I
hope in the future we will do it sooner rather than later.''
</P>
<P>
   The world body got a boost last week from a proposal for ending
the Kosovo conflict that Russia and the major Western powers agreed
to Thursday. The deal was a diplomatic advance for Moscow and
Belgrade, which have been pressing for a larger UN role. It also
provides the US and its NATO allies with the prospect of UN
sanction for any ultimate political settlement.
</P>
<P>
   While it remains unlikely that the US would agree to putting
NATO troops in the region under UN command, there is now agreement
in Washington and Moscow that any peacekeeping role will require
approval of the UN Security Council. And the world body is expected
to play a role in overseeing the creation of a transitional
government in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``This statement brings the United Nations into a greater
post-conflict role than it played in Bosnia,'' said Ivo Daalder,
the former top Balkans expert at the National Security Council.
``And it reestablishes the importance of UN legitimacy, if not in
going to war, at least in how you build a peace.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, some observers and diplomats have decried what
they saw as the growing irrelevance of the United Nations. Its role
in international peacekeeping had been scaled back following
troubled operations from Somalia to Angola, where the United
Nations withdrew after a $1 million-a-day peacekeeping failed to
stop a decades-long civil war.
</P>
<P>
   On March 24, the US and its NATO allies bypassed the UN Security
Council as they launched the greatest offensive military operation
since the birth of the alliance 50 years ago. Faced with a certain
Russian veto in the Security Council, American and European
diplomats argued that they were justified in acting by the need to
halt a looming humanitarian calamity.
</P>
<P>
   But six weeks of a punishing NATO air campaign have failed to
prevent the expulsion of ethnic Albanians by Serbian forces or to
pressure Milosevic to accept NATO troops in Kosovo to guarantee the
Albanians' right to return and to a degree of self-government. NATO
has stepped up its air campaign in recent days, but the Clinton
Administration has also increased its contacts with Russia to find
a diplomatic solution to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Thursday by Russia and the Group of Seven
industrial powers, the United States acceded to Russia's demand
that a key role in a postwar settlement for the UN Security
Council, where Moscow enjoys veto power. The United States also
agreed to omit the mention of NATO from the statement, although US
officials insisted that NATO would play a central role in any
international force.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has been pressing for the UN chief to take a more active
role in mediating the conflict. On Monday, Moscow's chief peace
envoy, former Prime Minsiter Viktor Chernomyrdin, asked Annan to
travel on a peace mission to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Annan, who pledged to work closely with the Russians, said
Friday that he won't rule out a visit to the Serb capital when the
time is right.
</P>
<P>
   Vladislav Jovanovic, Yugoslavia's ambassador to the United
Nations, said in an interview that his government first invited
Annan on Oct. 1. Jovanivic said Annan has been ``evasive'' about
his plans.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade prefers a peacekeeping role for the United Nations,
which is likely to field a less heavily armed force than NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Jovanovic said the UN humanitarian mission has not yet been
granted access to Kosovo by Yugoslav authorities, and any UN effort
would have to address the needs of Serb victims of the NATO bombing
campaign as well the situation of displaced ethnic Albanians still
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The UN's reputation ``was very seriously damaged by the act of
NATO,'' said Jovanovic. ``Only the speedy recovery of its role can
save the UN from repeating the fate of the League of Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan acknowledged that his diplomatic intervention carried
risks for the organization, whose reputation has been badly
tarnished by diplomatic setbacks from Angola to Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are high for the governments involved,'' Annan
said. ``The stakes are high for the United Nations, too.''

 &HT;    Media Metrix stock price soars on first trading day
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Media Metrix, currently the provider of the Internet's
best measurement of eyeballs on Web sites, more than doubled its
stock price on its first day of trading.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which merged with Atlanta-based Web measurement
firm Relevant Knowledge last year, opened for trading Friday at
$33, the first price at which most investors were able to buy the
stock _ and gained an additional $12.56 1/4 to close at $45.56 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Media Metrix surveys computer users to determine how many people
are visiting individual Web sites at home and in the workplace, the
measurement on which advertising rates for those sites are set.
</P>
<P>
   The company's clients include almost every major Internet
company, including America Online, Yahoo!, CNN, Amazon.com and
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a direct correlation between the growth in
revenue of this company and the growth in advertising revenue on
the Internet,'' said Paul Bard, an analyst with Renaissance Capital
Corp. in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Media Metrix faces potential competition from
Nielsen-NetRatings, which launched its own Web measurement business
in March. Nielsen-NetRatings offers subscribers detailed
advertising data but has drawn fire from critics for failing to
offer a measurement of use at the workplace, where Web activity is
the greatest.
</P>
<P>
   Media Metrix, itself, raised $51 million from the offering of 3
million shares at $17 per share. The original pricing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission was $12 to $14. In its SEC
filing, Media Metrix said it planned to use the money for new
product development, international expansion and general corporate
purposes, including working capital.

CHINA MOVES TO STOP RECEPTION OF FOREIGN TELEVISION CHANNELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ In a move that may reflect China's jitters during a
year of politically charged milestones, the Chinese government has
begun to clamp down on the illegal reception of foreign television
channels.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the government issued a warning in an official
newspaper that cable operators were barred from carrying foreign
satellite programs. And on Thursday, state television showed the
police confiscating satellite dishes, receivers and decoders from a
Chinese satellite television company in Fujian province.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives said China's crackdown appeared to be the
latest in a periodic enforcement of laws that restrict
satellite-delivered television services to hotels and residential
complexes for foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the government has rarely enforced the laws. That
has allowed hundreds of cable operators to pick up and retransmit
channels like ESPN and the Phoenix Chinese Channel to millions of
viewers. In China's prosperous regions, rooftop satellite dishes
are a common sight.
</P>
<P>
   But now, with the 10th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square
massacre less than a month away, some industry experts believe the
government wants to curtail foreign channels that might carry news
reports about the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very sensitive time,'' said Eric Li, a director at
Claydon Gescher Associates, a consulting firm in Beijing that
advises clients on the Chinese communications market. ``With so
many big events going on, it would be natural for the government to
take a look at what's coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Tiananmen anniversary, in October China will
mark the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the People's
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The government's action could pose a threat to several major
Western media companies with ambitions in China, including Walt
Disney Co. and Viacom. ESPN, which is owned by Disney, and MTV,
owned by Viacom, are both distributed in China through satellite
signals that are retransmitted by cable.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most vulnerable is News Corp., which owns part of
Phoenix Satellite Television, a Mandarin-language entertainment
channel that is aimed exclusively at the mainland Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix reaches an estimated 45 million households in China,
most through cable operators who pick up its satellite signal from
Hong Kong and retransmit it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know whether this is a temporary thing or something
more permanent that could affect our business,'' said Jannie Poon,
a spokeswoman for Phoenix, which is also partly owned by two
Chinese companies.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Poon said executives at Phoenix were consulting with
industry regulators in Beijing. But she noted that decisions
governing foreign television programming were often made by
higher-level officials, and it was not clear why the authorities
had chosen to take a hard line now.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the speculation about Tiananmen Square, industry
executives said Beijing may also be nervous about the spread of
satellites in Fujian, a coastal province that faces Taiwan. These
satellites enable thousands of homes in Fujian to receive
television broadcasts from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown would be a setback for Rupert Murdoch, the
chairman of News Corp. Murdoch has lobbied for years to establish a
foothold in China. Last December, he met with China's president,
Jiang Zemin, seeming to cement his return to favor after a speech
in 1993 in which he said that satellites posed ``an unambiguous
threat to totalitarian regimes everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some industry analysts said that given the murkiness of
their status in China, Phoenix and other foreign satellite
television services ought to be prepared for sporadic challenges to
their business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you build your business model on a law not really being
implemented, you are running a lot of risks,'' Li said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The timing of China's crackdown on satellite television would
seem odd, given that the government is in the latter stages of
negotiating to enter the World Trade Organization. But legal
experts noted that the openness of the Chinese television market
was not an issue in the broader WTO talks.
</P>
<P>
   And some said that China's action should not be interpreted as a
wholesale closing of its communications market. The government,
they said, could tighten its grip temporarily out of a perceived
short-term political interest while still maintaining a long-term
policy of gradually opening its market.
</P>
<P>
   Kaushik Shridharani, a media analyst at Salomon Smith Barney
here, said foreign television broadcasters had made considerable
headway in China in the last few years. One of Hong Kong's most
popular channels, TVB, is widely and illegally distributed in
neighboring Guangdong province by Chinese cable operators who
receive and retransmit its signal over their networks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, TVB is close to a deal in which the cable operators will
continue to carry the channel, but will pay the company for the
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, China moves two steps forward and one step
back,'' said Jeanette Chan, a partner who specializes in
communications law at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &AMP; Garrison in
Hong Kong. ``Just because they're doing a crackdown doesn't mean
they're not also trying to liberalize.''

BELGRADE IN DARKNESS AFTER HEAVY NATO BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a day of increasing optimism that Yugoslav
officials were warming to an international peace plan, NATO planes
pounded Belgrade with bombs Friday night, setting the Chinese
Embassy ablaze and sending the city into darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials had been edging closer to discussing a peace
agreement earlier in the day, prompting a flurry of hopeful
diplomatic activity around the world. Yugoslav television described
the path toward peace as ``a very lengthy and complex process,
which will probably end successfully.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian special envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin had also shown signs
of cautious optimism, announcing plans to visit Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to discuss the peace proposal, agreed to by
Russian and Western leaders Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the attack on the Chinese Embassy threatened to jeopardize
the earlier progress. China, as a permanent member of the UN
Security Council, has the power to veto any peace agreement brought
to the table. Chinese leaders are opposed to the NATO airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they did not believe anyone was killed in the
attack. Around the same time, blasts were also reported at three
major power stations in the Serbian capital. Heavy anti-aircraft
fire _ some of the heaviest seen thus far in the air campaign _
also lit up the sky, according to television reports.
</P>
<P>
   The attack followed another controversial NATO strike the night
before, in which NATO admitted it had probably accidentally rained
cluster bombs on civilians. Officials said it was ``highly
probable'' it had dropped a series of devastating bombs near a
hospital and a market 120 miles southeast of Belgrade early Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists who were escorted to the scene by Serb officials
reported seeing splintered buildings and dismembered human bodies
where the bombs apparently hit. Serb officials said the attack left
15 civilians dead. At least 1,500 Yugoslavians have been killed and
another 5,000 wounded since the conflict began March 24, Yugoslav
officials said earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is performing daytime attacks. That is a western
democracy, this is a residential area,'' Jovan Zlatic, head of the
county of Nis, said, joining the chorus of Serb objections to the
NATO missiles, which have strayed from their military targets
repeatedly in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we ask the whole world and every man on the planet: `How
can this genocidal aggression be possible only one day after the
G-8 meeting decided to solve the conflict by peaceful means?' ''
asked Serbian Deputy Premier Milovan Bojic. ``This is not an
accidental mistake by the NATO air force. This is an intentional
act to destroy a nation, an act of genocide.''
</P>
<P>
   The renewed vigor of the air campaign reflected the US political
message of the day: That any diplomatic weakening on the part of
Milosevic will be met only with further bombing until he agrees to
total peace.
</P>
<P>
   American officials rejected pleas from both Serb and Russian
officials for the bombing to stop. General Hugh Shelton, chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, vowed to continue the campaign
``until such time as Milosevic has agreed to the terms established
by NATO.'' President Clinton issued a call for similar resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important for the United States and our allies
neither to add nor subtract from the basic conditions that we have
said all along are essential to make this work,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments Friday:
</P>
<P>
   _ For the second time, a NATO missile struck Bulgaria, roughly
12 miles west of Sofia. An earlier missile strayed into Bulgaria on
April 28.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Congress, Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, Republican of
New York, announced plans to hold hearings next Thursday in the
House International Relations Committee. Gilman cautioned Congress
to ``be mindful that it is diplomacy that will ultimately shape the
future of Kosovo and Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Over earlier objections of Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan announced the appointment
of two new special envoys to the Balkans: former Swedish Prime
Minister Carl Bildt and Slovakian Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan.
Bildt had publicly criticized the NATO airstrikes, saying they were
insufficient to win the war and indicative of NATO's lack of
commitment to sending in ground troops. Annan said both men were
``very experienced and very good negotiators.''
</P>
<P>
   _ As many as 176 US Air Force and Marine Corps planes _
including 36 more F-15 fighter jets, 18 more A-10 attack planes and
80 more tanker planes _ were on their way to the Balkans to join
the war effort, Pentagon officials said. A day earlier, the House
approved $13 billion for spending on the conflict and military
readiness.
</P>
<P>
   The distance between war and peace remained difficult to gauge,
particularly as several sticking points repeatedly emerged. Among
the most serious: whether NATO, or US troops, would be a part of
any international peacekeeping force to take control of Kosovo
after the fighting stops.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials have said NATO would be at the core of any
such force, and yet Milosevic has rejected that idea. The force is
defined in the plan only as an ``effective international civil and
security'' presence. Presidential National Security Adviser Sandy
Berger Friday described it as a ``robust presence that would not
only be able to defend itself but maintain civil order,'' leaving
its definition completely unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   The disagreement over peacekeeping forces was among the
controversies that caused the Rambouillet peace talks to fail,
prompting NATO to begin airstrikes.

LABOR WINS MOST SEATS IN NEW LEGISLATURES IN SCOTLAND AND WALES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDINBURGH, Scotland _ Prime Minister Tony Blair has succeeded in
holding off threats from nationalist parties in Scotland and Wales,
with his Labor Party winning the most seats in the new legislatures
there, election results showed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Labor failed to win outright control of the Scottish Parliament
or the Welsh National Assembly, but Blair said he still felt the
results represented an endorsement of his reform of British
politics. He has made the parceling out, or devolution, of
authority to the regions of Britain a principal objective of his
two-year-old government.
</P>
<P>
   ``In relation to Scotland and Wales, I think the most important
elements are that we have made devolution work, and in Scotland
it's absolutely clear that the vast majority of people voted for
parties that are opposed to the nationalist agenda of
independence,'' the prime minister said in London as tabulations in
Thursday's election concluded. ``People have rejected the notion of
separatism.''
</P>
<P>
   He said devolution represented no threat to the future security
of a united Britain. ``I believe and I hope that out of these
elections the union of the United Kingdom will have been
strengthened rather than weakened,'' he told reporters at 10
Downing St.
</P>
<P>
   The election also filled more than 12,000 local council seats
across Britain, voting that is viewed as a midterm barometer
reading of the party in power.
</P>
<P>
   The Conservatives showed stirrings of recovery from the their
overwhelming setbacks in the general election in 1997 and the last
midterm election, in 1995. Their modest gains of 1,300 town hall
seats were seen as sufficient to save their beleaguered head,
William Hague, from an immediate leadership challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties traditionally recover ground in midterm
elections, and the Labor Party was particularly susceptible to
losses now because of the runaway numbers they had scored in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Tory gains gave no encouragement to the party's hopes of
winning Britain back in the next election. Labor's overall vote
total was higher than the Conservatives', a rare occurrence in
Britain of a party in power beating the opposition in a midterm
election. Hague sought to put a gloss on that setback, saying,
``After everything we have been told about how the Labor Party
walks on electoral water, we have come within 3 percentage points
of them.''
</P>
<P>
   By falling 9 seats short of a majority in the 129-seat Scottish
Parliament, Labor will be obliged to enlist the centrist Liberal
Democrats in a coalition, a form of governing not seen in Britain
since World War II. In Wales, Labor won 28 of the 60 seats and will
quite likely adopt the same tactic there.
</P>
<P>
   For Scotland it is the first legislature since union with
England in 1707, and for Wales it is the first ever. Mindful of
this historic dimension to the balloting, politicians urged people
to show up at the polls in high numbers. The BBC prefaced its
periodic reports with the heraldic introduction ``History in the
Making,'' and the front page of The Scotsman read, ``This is the
day we have dreamed of ... today we vote.''
</P>
<P>
   But fewer than 60 percent of eligible Scottish voters cast
ballots, some 13 percentage points less than at the general
election two years ago, and politicians bemoaned the low turnout.
Some people blamed the wet and windy weather, some faulted the
undemonstrative nature of Scots and others pointed to negative
campaigning in the hard-fought contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the political class failed to get across to the voters
how important this was,'' said John Curtice, professor of politics
at the University of Strathclyde.
</P>
<P>
   In Wales the turnout was 38 percent, and in England, where the
voting was just for council seats, 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The two new regional legislatures will gain authority and
budgets to pursue matters like transportation, health, education
and housing. The British Parliament in London keeps the broader
portfolios of foreign, defense, economic and fiscal policy. The
Scottish Parliament has lawmaking and taxing powers, while the
Welsh National Assembly does not.
</P>
<P>
   In both new legislatures, the principal opposition parties are
the nationalists, leaving the Conservatives in unaccustomed third
place. The Welsh nationalist group, Plaid Cymru (pronounced plyde
KUM-ry), is not a pro-independence party, but the Scottish
Nationalist Party is.
</P>
<P>
   Led by their politically canny head, Alex Salmond, the Scottish
Nationalists stunned Labor in the early months of the campaign by
climbing 15 points into the lead in opinion polls. But as the race
drew to a close, they lost followers and finished Friday with less
than 30 percent of the vote and under 40 seats in the legislature,
two goals they had set for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the slightest bit downhearted,'' Salmond said, noting
that his party had polled 7 points higher than in the last
election.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that many voters, approaching the brink of the idea
of secession from Britain, stepped back. ``There was a lot of talk
about independence, and that scared people off a bit,'' said
Professor James Kellas of the University of Glasgow.
</P>
<P>
   The elections were the first time that mainline Britain had
experienced proportional representation voting; it was used in the
elections to the new Northern Ireland Assembly last year.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure is intended to produce a result that better
reflects the total vote won by each party than does the traditional
system used in Britain, in which each seat goes to the top
vote-getter in a legislative district.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Labor government's idea to use proportional
representation, even though it tends to benefit smaller parties
more than larger ones and can end up producing the kind of
coalition arrangements more common to Continental countries. Blair
said Friday that ``it was always going to be the case that by
taking a different electoral system, it was highly unlikely any
party would have an overall majority.''

KHADAFY SEEN AS PEACEMAKER IN MANY AFRICAN NATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ As Washington warily prepares to end an 18-year
boycott of Libya, Colonel Moammar Khadafy has been anything but
isolated on his own continent, where he has armed, financed and
trained many of Africa's emerging leaders, from Liberia to Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Since the UN suspended sanctions on Libya last month,
processions of African heads of state have traveled to the
colonel's desert tent to pay their respects. And the former sponsor
of international terrorism is now being welcomed as a peacemaker by
prominent African leaders, including one-time comrade-in-arms
Nelson Mandela, who owe their own political survival to the Arab
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Laurent Kabila, the president of the Democratic Republic of
Congo, turned to the Libyan colonel in the 1980s for help in his
rebellion against Mobutu Sese Seko, the corrupt dictator who ruled
the former Zaire.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Taylor, who now leads Liberia after being educated and
doing jail time in Massachusetts, received military training and
weapons from Tripoli during his rise to power.
</P>
<P>
   And Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni, a favorite in
Washington, recently thanked Khadafy for supplying him with 900
rifles when he was a struggling rebel leader.
</P>
<P>
   But as Libya embarks on a series of high-level diplomatic
initiatives to mediate African conflicts in the Congo, Sierra
Leone, and in the Horn of Africa, US policymakers are wondering
whether the Libyan leader will continue his role as spoiler.
</P>
<P>
   And they fret that the fiercely anti-American Khadafy will use
his new breathing-room to undermine American policies in the region
and to train and arm a new generation of African insurgents.
</P>
<P>
   While US officials concede that Khadafy has moderated his
behavior in recent years, they still suspect he continues to
secretly develop chemical weapons. And they suspect he continues to
fund armed groups, including those in Sierra Leone and Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Acting through his long-time allies, Taylor in Liberia and
Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso, Khadafy channels money and arms to
Sierra Leonean rebels seeking the overthrow of the country's first
elected president, according to US and African officials.
</P>
<P>
   He financed the deployment of several hundred Chadian soldiers
in Congo to fight alongside Kabila's forces. He funneled arms
through Gambia into Guinea Bissau, whose government was overthrown
by rebels Friday. And he has provided funding for Eritrea's war
against Ethiopia, prompting a formal protest from the Ethiopian
government, according to diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a situation that the Libyans can screw up, they
will do it,'' said Joseph Sala, a political analyst who served in
the State Department's Africa bureau until 1998. ``Nobody sees a
clear pattern to it, but there has been a consistent effort in the
past to destabilize West Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   In Uganda, Khadafy handed rifles to Museveni's successful rebel
army, but earlier he had provided military support to the brutal
government of Idi Amin, who was deposed in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, Libya continues to hedge its bets, supplying modest
financial and military support to insurgencies in countries with
which it has warm relations.
</P>
<P>
   Chad and Niger, for instance, have provided critical support for
Libya in its quest to have UN economic sanctions lifted. But US
officials charge that Khadafy continues to arm rebel Toubous and
Tuaregs in those countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly much of our media portrays Khadafy as a bungling idiot,
but he is one of the masters of realpolitik,'' one US official
said. ``He'll support a rebel force to keep his own allies in
check.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Khadafy's continued support for African insurgencies,
the Clinton administration remains committed to sitting down at the
table with Libyan officials at UN-sponsored talks for the first
time in 18 years. The meeting later this month will consider
whether to permanently lift sanctions following Tripoli's surrender
of two suspects for trial in connection with the 1988 bombing of
Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, meanwhile, has agreed to ease US sanctions on Libya,
Sudan and Iran, granting US companies the right to sell food and
medicines to those countries. The softening of the American
position on Libya marked a major shift in its policy since it broke
diplomatic relations with Libya in the early 1980s, charging that
Tripoli was a chief sponsor of international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   While Khadafy has sought to build bridges with his African
counterparts, his relations with the Arab world have become
considerably more chilly. Angered that Arab leaders failed to join
Africans in violating a UN air embargo, Khadafy has made it clear
he will spend his oil wealth on his own continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these African leaders defied the embargo and came to
visit him when he was sick,'' said Clovis Maksoud, a former UN
ambassador for the Arab League. ``The Arabs did not go.''
</P>
<P>
   US and European officials say that Khadafy still owes hundreds
of millions to European and Russian creditors, whose accounts were
frozen after sanctions were imposed. They say his current
popularity is likely to fade when the economic realities set in.

COMPAQ TO SLASH THE NUMBER OF ITS PC DISTRIBUTORS  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By TRICIA SERJU-HARRIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Compaq Computer Corp. will announce next week a
distribution alliance plan that is expected to slash the number of
PC distributors who sell its products to four from about 40.
</P>
<P>
   The PC maker is expected to make the cuts to lower costs, manage
inventory and better track consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
   The distributors who survive the downsizing will receive more
volume to make up for the loss at other outlets, but they may have
to give Compaq better terms.
</P>
<P>
   The likely survivors will be Ingram Micro, Tech Data Corp.,
Merisel and CompuCom Systems, Ashok Kumar, an analyst at U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray, told Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   Ingram Micro and Tech Data make Compaq's Prosignia products for
small and medium-sized businesses and build some other products at
Houston-based Compaq's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Merisel also works with Compaq to build some computers on site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compaq's job of managing distribution will become a lot
simpler,'' said Kurt King, an analyst at NationsBanc Montgomery
Securities, told Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   Although the PC maker would not give details of the plan, the
surprise measure was greeted with enthusiasm from analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time coming,'' Kumar said. ``They needed to
make some tough decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   This would be the first major move Chairman and acting Chief
Executive Officer Ben Rosen has made since Eckhard Pfeiffer was
forced to resign as CEO and Earl Mason, Compaq's chief financial
officer, quit to become the president of a company in a
non-technology industry last month.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq has been under rising pressure from analysts and
shareholders for some time now. Sales have slowed and earnings have
slipped. The stock price has lost more than half its value since
reaching a record high of 49 1/4 in January.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq rose 1/4 to 24 7/8 in heavy trading Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The distributors who don't make the cut may end up competing
with Compaq as the company moves further away from traditional
storefront selling to offering its products on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't satisfy all the people all of the time,'' Kumar
said. ``They have to do what's best for Compaq and its
shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Compaq also is likely to reduce the amount of price protection
it gives to distributors, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   When a computer is sold through a distributor, the manufacturer
often guarantees that if prices fall before the machine is sold, it
will make up the difference.
</P>
<P>
   But that makes it difficult for Compaq to compete with Dell
Computer Corp., which carries only days of inventory and don't have
to offer any price protection.
</P>
<P>
   Computer prices can fall as much as 1 percent a week while
sitting on warehouse shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Other computer-related companies already have made similar moves
in consolidating distributors.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer cut the number of distributors to two from five,
and Seagate Technology reduced its distributors to five from 12.

HOLOVAK QUIETLY DECIDES `IT'S TIME' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was always quiet and would never do anything to call
attention to himself. So it is not surprising that just a few weeks
short of his 80th birthday, the marvelous Mike Holovak walked away
from a football career that covered 68 years and has been matched
by few.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for me,'' Holovak said Friday from his Florida
retirement home. ``I've been so lucky. All of my life I have worked
at something I loved to do. But coaching was the most fun. That's
what I loved best.''
</P>
<P>
   Holovak, son of a Polish immigrant who immigrated to the coal
mines of Pennsylvania, was one of Boston College's first great
football players. He was All-American running back in the early
1940s and a first-round draft choice of the powerful Chicago Bears.
After serving in World War II, he returned to play in Chicago. He
then coached BC for nine years, was coach and general manager of
the Patriots for 10 years, had a tour as assistant and interim head
coach of the Jets, went back to the Patriots as a scout, then went
to Houston for 19 years as GM and player personnel director.
</P>
<P>
   Holovak is one of three men whose tremendous contributions to
the Boston area have not been properly recognized. The others are
Milt Schmidt of the Bruins and Johnny Pesky of the Red Sox. Schmidt
and Pesky have been in the area for 60 years, playing, coaching,
and doing countless good works for all kinds of charities. They are
truly part of the fabric of this city.
</P>
<P>
   Holovak, though he started in Pennsylvania and ended in
Tennessee (where the Oilers moved), will always be a Bostonian.
Billy Sullivan founded the Patriots, but the guy who saved them was
Holovak. It was his personality, and the love his players had for
him, that kept the team afloat in its first decade of existence.
The team won consistently with the lowest payroll in the league and
the worst practice conditions imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved my players on those teams,'' said Holovak. ``I will
always think of them as `my boys.' They were such good guys, and so
many of them did so well when they were finished playing. I still
feel good about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Holovak's life story reads like a history of pro football. He
played for the legendary George Halas, who founded the National
Football League. ``I liked him a lot. He was a regular guy. I was
the number one draft choice and he gave me a thousand dollars,''
Holovak said with a laugh. ``Not bad for those days. We had fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played with Hall of Famers like Sid Luckman, George McAfee,
and Bulldog Turner. Now there was a player.'' Turner was the Dick
Butkus of his day. ``The night before a game Halas would have a
meeting and give the team a test to make sure they were paying
attention. Bulldog would always sit beside me, because Halas would
ask us to identify the numbers of the key players on the other
team, and Bulldog knew I would give him the answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Holovak's biggest disappointment came as the general
manager of the Oilers. As a scout, he brought quarterback Warren
Moon out of Canada to Houston with the intent of building a strong
contending team around him. ``I went to Canada the final year
Warren was up there and watched every game he played in person. I
told Houston we had to get him.'' Holovak helped build a powerhouse
with the Oilers, a team that went to the playoffs eight straight
years, but never got to the Super Bowl. ``It was frustrating,''
Holovak said. ``There were a couple of years in there I knew our
talent was as good as any team in the league, and a lot of other
people felt that way. But we just couldn't get it done. A couple of
years a guy named Elway beat us, and then another year in Buffalo,
we blew the biggest lead ever to the Bills and lost. That was
devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   Holovak, like Schmidt and Pesky, gave up part of his life to
fight in World War II but has no regrets. ``After I got out of
Boston College in 1943, I went to PT (boat) school in Melville,
R.I., and then to the South Pacific. On Christmas Day, on the
island of New Guinea, I came down with malaria. I didn't know what
hit me. I went into the hospital and was unconscious for a week. I
woke up on New Year's Day. I didn't know anything that happened
that whole week. So when I look back, there is very little I would
have changed in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Holovak was deeply saddened by Friday's death of the wonderful
Leon Hess, as were most of us who had the privilege of knowing the
owner of the New York Jets. ``He was just a fabulous man, one of
the best,'' said Holovak. ``He never interfered. He was one of the
most thoughtful men I have ever met. I remember each year at
Christmas, no matter what the team's record was, he would have a
party for every member of the organization and their children. And
he would have a gift for every person who came. He would have to be
considered one of the best owners ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Hess was one of the wealthiest men in the United States, but he
had a common touch. There was never any pretense to Hess, the
consumate gentleman in dress and manner. Two stories show what he
was like. When defensive tackle Dennis Byrd suffered a serious neck
injury and looked as though he could be paralyzed for life, Hess,
even though he was closing in on 80 at the time, visited Byrd every
single day he was in the hospital. And just this past January, when
Hess was not strong enough to make the trip to see his team play in
the AFC Championship Game in Denver, which it lost, he was waiting
for the team when it arrived back in New York at 1:30 in the
morning. As the team got off its plane, Hess shook the hand of
everyone on it, and personally thanked them for their contribution
to the season. All the while a friend had to hold him by the arm to
help him stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved this guy,'' said Jets coach Bill Parcells. ``He was as
fine a man as anyone I've ever met. It was a privilege to be able
to know him, and I'm very fortunate that I had the chance to coach
for him and to get to know him. His loss will be a tremendous one
to the New York Jets.''
</P>
<P>
   Patriots owner Bob Kraft on Hess: ``When I first came in to the
league, he was great to me, giving me all the benefits of his
experience in the game. He was a real elder statesman in the
National Football League. It's hard to replace men like him.''

   Let me see if I understand this. The Dream Team of doctors that
was called in to try to help Reggie Lewis when he first collapsed
was no good, so Donna Harris-Lewis pulled him out of New England
Baptist Hospital. Then the next set of doctors at Brigham and
Women's Hospital were no good, so she is suing them. What should be
remembered is the Dream Team was made up of the top cardiologists
from most all of the top hospitals around the city, not just New
England Baptist. Dr. Arnold Scheller, who testified on behalf of
Lewis (and the Celtics) this week, is an orthopedic doctor, not a
cardiologist. One item in Scheller's testimony I found particularly
interesting was that he said he told Lewis he was going to test him
for cocaine the next day, and at midnight that night, Donna moved
him to Brigham and Woman's . . . When Heisman Trophy winner Ricky
Williams showed up at the NFL's scouting combine in Indianapolis in
February, he weighed in at 240. When he worked out in San Diego in
early April for teams interesed in him, he weighed 224. Seventeen
days later, when he arrived in New Orleans after being drafted by
the Saints, he was back up to 240, gaining almost a pound a day
after the workout . . . The best-kept secret around here is BC
slugger Sean McGowan, the best collegiate power hitter ever in New
England. ``Sean is as good as anyone I have seen in college ball,''
said coach Peter Hughes. ``What he has done this season is
phenomenal.'' McGowan, a 6-foot-6-inch, 240-pounder with just 8
percent body fat, has 23 home runs in 41 games this year and leads
the nation in home runs per game. In the last three years at BC, he
has hit 51 home runs in 102 games. ``He has never been drafted,''
said Hughes, ``but he will go high this year. A year ago, scouts
questioned whether he could hit with a wooden bat, so he played in
a league where they used wooden bats last summer and he hit 14 home
runs and batted .430. We played against Arizona State this year,
and he had three home runs against them. In my mind, Sean is the
best power hitter in college ball.'' Who holds the Big East record
for home runs in a single season? Mo Vaughn with 28 when he played
for Seton Hall.

 &HT;    Huddle House tries to serve up new image
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Huddle House is tired of playing the poor cousin to
other restaurant chains.
</P>
<P>
   The Decatur-based company, which has spent the past 35 years
catering to blue-collar palates, is trying to expand its customer
base with a new look, expanded menu and slick television and prints
ads.
</P>
<P>
   The diner-style chain of 335 restaurants is hoping more
professionals and families will sit along side factory workers and
bricklayers to eat its made-to-order burgers, eggs and salads.
</P>
<P>
   It's greasy-spoon, mom-and-pop image is fast fading.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking to take Huddle House to a whole new level,''
said President and Chief Executive Officer Philip M. Greifeld.
``It's a dynamic world out there. We have to adapt, adjust and
listen to our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Greifeld, who joined the company as chief financial officer in
1995, considers the chain known for its ``any meal, any time'' deal
and 24-7 hours of operations, ``a gem.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the next year, he expects same store sales, a major
indicator of a retail or restaurant company's financial health, to
grow at a respectable 2.5 percent clip.
</P>
<P>
   But in order to grow, says Greifeld, who assumed the top post in
October, the company will have to look outside its traditional
southeastern stronghold. Currently, the chain has restaurants in a
dozen states, but soon Huddle House plans to open units in new
markets including Ohio, Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia.
Still, it will be dwarfed by another Georgia company, its main
competitor, Waffle House, which has more than 1,000 units
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to focus on being good at what we do,'' said Greifeld.
``We have to look at every aspect of our business.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of news that franchisees like Elden Carmichael
want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Carmichael, whose Brunswick company now owns 15
units, considered getting out of the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it was kind of stagnant,'' said Carmichael, president
of EH Inc. ``We weren't seeing much bounce out of corporate. But
they're doing a better job.''
</P>
<P>
   Carmichael said he is already starting to see a change in his
customer base.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have blue collar customers, but we're starting to see a
wider spectrum of customers,'' he said. ``We're doing pretty nice
in terms of where we have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurial streak
</P>
<P>
   Franchisees credit Greifeld, who has a degree in business
economics, with the company's new direction.
</P>
<P>
   Greifeld, who has a strong entrepreneurial streak, decided to
skip corporate America and strike out his own. He and several
partners formed a retail home furnishings business, financed
primarily with venture capital funds.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the business hit rocky times and closed. But, by
then, Greifeld's skills had come to the attention of the venture
capitalists, Quad C, who had just bought a small restaurant company
in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Impressed, they convinced him to take the chief financial
officer job. It wasn't a hard sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a kick out of building things,'' said Greifeld. ``I like
to plant acorns and watch them grow into oak trees.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case his acorn was Huddle House.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the company wasn't doing well. Huddle House was named
one of the top 50 growth companies by Restaurant Business magazine
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   And the family-owned business was profitable, but clearly needed
some retooling.
</P>
<P>
   ``What impressed me most was their market position,'' he said.
``And this was an underserved segment of the industry. It could
only go up. This was a golden opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Greifeld has a laid-back style, preferring employees to call him
by his first name.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone says 'sir' I start looking for my dad,'' said
Greifeld, who lives in Conyers with his wife and two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   He continually refers to the staff as a ``team'' and strongly
encourages workers to voice their opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job here is to cultivate the team and get them excited,''
he said. ``At the end of the day, I don't want everyone looking to
me for all of the answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Head-to-head competition
</P>
<P>
   Greifeld plans to go head to head with his competition, mainly
``brand X with the W''.
</P>
<P>
   He also is feeling increased pressure from other restaurant
companies including chains such as Applebee's, Shoney's and Cracker
Barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Industry watchers say Greifeld's plans are ambitious, but not
impossible
</P>
<P>
   ``Their reputation is probably of having medium quality food at
a reasonable price, but certainly not someplace that I would want
to dine with my family,'' said Leenie Rubin, president of Marketing
Spectrum, an Atlanta-based restaurant consulting business. ``It's
going to be very hard for them to keep their core business and
expand. Their key competitor is Waffle House, which has done an
exceptional job. Waffle House has stayed with who they are. They
haven't changed on their promise and deliver exactly what they say
they are going to _ a decent meal at a reasonable price in a
reasonable environment.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rubin doesn't write off Huddle House's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it is because of lifestyle changes,'' she said.
``People are now out and about on a more irregular basis and like
the convenience.''
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining the core base
</P>
<P>
   Greifeld's strategy is to ``polish the apple'' by changing the
company's image and diversify its clientele. He is adamant,
however, about keeping its core base.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that will achieved through marketing. The company is in
talks with at least one sports celebrity about becoming a company
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   It recently began a promotion with Pepsi Cola and Dodge to award
customers prizeds including trips to Disney World and new Dodge
van.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to open a new prototype of the restaurant soon, which
will use brighter colors and be more open. There are also plans to
expand the menu offerings and to have new uniforms for workers.
</P>
<P>
   But the changes are not just cosmetic.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also on an aggressive growth binge opening new
co-branded units with convenience stores, fuel centers and travel
plazas.
</P>
<P>
   Greifeld plans to open 35 new stores by the end of the next
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are really going to start to take notice,'' he said.
``I'm not afraid to make the hard decisions to improve this
brand.''
</P>
<P>
   The former entrepreneur, who assumed the top spot last October,
had made it clear to franchisees that it will take a team effort to
reach the company's goals. Some have been told they must either
shape up or risk being booted out of the chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to know that you can't go wrong with a Huddle
House.''

`JENNY JONES SHOW' FOUND NEGLIGENT IN SHOOTING DEATH OF GUEST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (mk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. _ In a case that has focused attention on
confrontational talk shows, a jury here on Friday ordered ``The
Jenny Jones Show'' to pay $25 million to the family of a gay man
who was shot to death after revealing that he was sexually
attracted to another man on the show.
</P>
<P>
   The jury in this northern suburb of Detroit found that Warner
Brothers, which owns, produces and distributes the show, was
negligent in the death of Scott Amedure, who died at the age of 32
in March 1995. Amedure was shot to death in the doorway of his home
three days after he revealed on the television show that he was
attracted to another guest, Jonathan Schmitz, and described his
sexual fantasies about Schmitz.
</P>
<P>
   Schmitz, who has been diagnosed as manic-depressive, was
convicted in 1996 of second-degree murder in the killing. The
conviction was overturned last November on a dispute over whether a
juror should have been dismissed, and a second criminal trial has
been set for August.
</P>
<P>
   The case has been closely watched by interest groups on all
sides, and Friday's decision immediately drew sharp reactions. Even
before the verdict was rendered, the case had an effect on daytime
talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the killing, shows like Jenny Jones', along with
others featuring Rikki Lake, Montel Williams and Jerry Springer,
were among the most profitable on television, earning as much as
$50 million to $60 million a year in profits. Often they relied on
ambushing some guests with people they were not expecting to see,
and discussing subjects they had not been told were going to be
discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Since the killing, the shows have fallen off sharply in
popularity and advertisers have begun to shy away from them. Except
for Springer's show, which still relies heavily on confrontational
topics that lead to fistfights virtually every day, the subject
matter has been toned down.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Fieger, the lead attorney for the Amedure family, said
he hoped Friday's civil verdict would change the way such talk
shows treat their guests. ``This industry has got to clean itself
up because these people care nothing about the people they use and
abuse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Warner Brothers' lawyers vowed to appeal the verdict to the
Michigan Court of Appeals, a process that could take two years.
Even if the verdict stands, the amount of the award could be
changed by an appellate court.
</P>
<P>
   The company's lawyers contended that the decision would force
all media to worry about liability if the subjects of their
interviews later behaved in destructive ways. ``This will have a
profoundly chilling effect not only on talk shows but on all
media,'' said Warner Brothers' senior attorney, Zazi Pope.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Abrams, a prominent First Amendment lawyer, said the
verdict was unwarranted. ``Whether we have a Jenny Jones show or a
Jerry Springer show is a matter of public taste,'' he said. ``I
think that the public is entitled to watch these shows if it wishes
and that these shows are protected'' by the Constitution's First
Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   But William Bennett, who was education secretary in the Reagan
administration and has been a strong critic of Hollywood in recent
years, said the verdict was part of a welcome trend. ``It's a good
thing for the public to look the entertainment companies in the eye
and say, `We've had it,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The talk show episode featuring Schmitz and Amedure was never
broadcast, although local television stations here have repeatedly
aired the segment in which Amedure proclaimed his affections.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Schmitz smiled during the show, and Warner Brothers' lawyers
said during the trial that he and Amedure had entered into a brief
relationship after the show. But the Amedure family's lawyers
denied this; Schmitz, who has said he is heterosexual, did not
testify during the civil trial because of his forthcoming criminal
retrial.
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights advocates also assailed Friday's decision,
criticizing the Amedure family and its lawyers for having said that
Schmitz had been publicly embarrassed by Amedure's advances.
Jeffrey Montgomery, the executive director of the Triangle
Foundation, a gay advocacy group in Michigan, said that by blaming
the talk show rather than Schmitz, the plaintiffs in the case had
fed homophobia and created a legal blueprint for Schmitz eventually
to win acquittal on murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference Friday, Fieger, the Amedures' attorney,
said that talk shows should screen their guests and provide
psychiatric care after taping, as some have started to do, in order
to avoid negligence cases.
</P>
<P>
   The five women and four men on the jury voted 8-1 to find Warner
Brothers negligent; Michigan law does not require unanimity in
civil verdicts. The jury awarded Amedure's family $5 million for
his pain and suffering when he was shot, $20 million for his loss
and $6,500 for his funeral expenses. But Warner Brothers does not
have to pay anything until its appeals are exhausted. Time Warner
Inc. owns most of Warner Brothers through a limited partnership.
</P>
<P>
   If the company loses in the Michigan Court of Appeals, it could
appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court, and from there to the U.S.
Supreme Court. Each level of appeal could delay a final decision by
two or more years.
</P>
<P>
   A local NBC station covered Friday's verdict live, breaking into
``The Jenny Jones Show,'' where Friday's topic was ``teens obsessed
with their looks.'' After the show resumed, Ms. Jones was shown
moderating arguments between her audience and guests, with one
guest telling viewers that an audience member ``looks like a
45-year-old hooker.'' Discussions ensued about the woman's
hairstyle and clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Kohut, the director of the Washington-based Pew Research
Center for the People and the Press, said that Friday's decision
was another sign of rising public hostility toward the media,
particularly after the shootings in Littleton, Colo. ``I'm
reasonably sure,'' he said, ``that the public would be on the side
of the plaintiff in this case because they feel the media don't
care enough about the consequences of their actions.''

CHUNG TO DESCRIBE SOURCE OF CHINESE FUNDS TO HOUSE COMMITTEE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark., Calif.) (rk) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A fund-raiser who pleaded guilty to tax violations
has told government investigators that a Chinese general in charge
of Beijing's intelligence service was behind $300,000 in payments
that were used in part as contributions to the Democratic National
Committee, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raiser, Johnny Chung, is expected to describe his
dealings with Gen. Ji Shengde and other Chinese intelligence
officials when he appears under subpoena on Tuesday before the
House government Reform and Oversight Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Chung, who has cooperated with the authorities investigating
campaign finance issues, is the first Asian-American fund-raiser to
testify publicly about his activities with elite Chinese business
and political figures who live in China and have remained beyond
the reach of congressional and Justice Department investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Brian Sun, Chung's lawyer, said Chung was never a
witting participant in a suspected Chinese intelligence scheme
intended to influence American elections, as Republicans in
Congress have asserted. Instead, Chung wanted to further business
contacts for his Asian contacts, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not about campaign finance,'' Sun said. ``It was about
entrepreneurs in China who wear both government and business hats
who were seeking access and relationships and business
opportunities. Johnny provided them with services. They could not
come here without visas that Johnny would help them get. He paid
their expenses and took them around.''
</P>
<P>
   Chung also made contributions to the Democratic Party totaling
$360,000 and sought access to senior government officials, visiting
the White House on more than 50 occasions and often taking along a
group of Chinese business officials.
</P>
<P>
   But for all Chung's activities, the most explosive subject Chung
is expected to address in his testimony is the source of the
payment he received from the People's Liberation Army through Liu
Chaoying, a lieutenant colonel and aerospace executive whose father
was a top military commander and member of the Communist Party's
ruling leadership.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, government officials have said that Ms. Liu was
an intermediary for the funds, which were provided to her by Ji,
the intelligence chief, whose involvement was first reported by The
Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how much of the $300,000 was turned over to the
Democrats. Campaign finance records show that Chung donated about
$35,000 of the money to the Democratic National Committee while
Chung kept the rest in his bank account in California.
</P>
<P>
   It is also uncertain whether Ji supplied the money from his own
funds or whether he too was merely an intermediary for someone
else. The general did ask Ms. Liu for a receipt for the money, one
official said, an unusual request for an intelligence operation,
suggesting that the general had to account for the money to a
higher authority.
</P>
<P>
   Chung is also expected to testify about conversations with Ms.
Liu that mentioned Mark E. Middleton, a former aide to Clinton and
lawyer from Arkansas, who left the White House in 1995 to set up an
international consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Chung said she told him that Chinese officials entered into a
$500,000 business arrangement with Middleton. But Robert D. Luskin,
Middleton's lawyer, said Middleton had never worked for Chinese
clients, but had received a payment of about $500,000 from an
Indonesian company for work unrelated to China.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The shares of Barclays PLC surged 39 percent in two
months after Michael O'Neill, a top executive at Bank of America,
was appointed chief executive in February.
</P>
<P>
   The market apparently expected O'Neill, an American who helped
oversee the merger of Bank of America and Nationsbank in the United
States, to shake Barclays, the profitable but troubled British
behemoth, out of its lethargy.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when O'Neill resigned last month for health reasons, the
shares of Barclays moved up 2.5 percent to yet another high. With
no other management knight riding to the rescue, the market
apparently expected a rival British bank to make a bid for
Barclays.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the market's message was clear: This is a great
bank, but it needs a lot of outside help.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Martin Taylor, the last full-time chief executive,
quit in a dispute over investment-banking strategy six months ago,
Barclays has been trying desperately to avoid the impression that
it is drifting while other European financial institutions forge
ahead with energetic restructuring. In an interview, Sir Peter
Middleton, the bank's 65-year-old chairman and acting chief
executive, made it clear that he, for one, believes the bank has
succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I set out to do when Martin Taylor left was to make
sure that the bank didn't stall either in its day-to-day operations
or strategically,'' said Sir Peter, a former British Treasury boss.
``So the business short-term is moving ahead and will continue to
move ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I am sure about with big organizations _ it
doesn't matter what it is _ is that if they are not being moved
forward, they move backwards. And I think we've managed that. We
have moved it forward. The business is doing well.''
</P>
<P>
   The new chief executive, he said, is being sought from the same,
closely guarded short-list that produced O'Neill, with both bank
insiders and outsiders under consideration. No names of outside
candidates have been made public, in part to avoid tipping off the
current employers of those being head-hunted. Within the bank, two
insiders, Chris Lendrum, head of corporate banking, and John
Varley, head of retail financial services, are viewed as
front-runners if no outsider is chosen. Big institutional
investors, however, reportedly oppose the appointment of an
insider, who they fear would be too susceptible to Sir Peter's
influence and might upset a management hierarchy that has barely
taken root after years of upheavals.
</P>
<P>
   If precedent is any guide, Barclays _ Britain's No. 2 bank and
the sixth-biggest in Europe _ will be willing to pay top dollar to
lure its top choice. O'Neill won a first-year salary-and-bonus
package of $2.8 million and an agreement by the bank to match his
purchase of $8.25 million in Barclays stock if he stayed for three
years, a compensation package regarded as very generous by British
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever takes the job will have his hands full, though.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out investment-bank strategy will be priority No. 1.
Like other big British banks, Barclays has already stumbled in its
attempts to muscle into the sector, which is dominated by the big
American securities firms. In late 1997, Barclays sold off the
European equity-and-merger businesses of its BZW investment unit to
Credit Suisse First Boston for about $170 million, a considerable
discount to book value.
</P>
<P>
   Then last year, Barclays Capital, the successor to BZW, lost 265
million pounds ($431.9 million at current exchange rates) in the
Russian financial meltdown. It subsequently closed down three
proprietary trading businesses seen as high-risk, reduced its
exposure in emerging markets, hedge funds and corporate bonds and
reined in its investment capital.
</P>
<P>
   Barclays' executives insist that the paring-down has left core
investment businesses intact, but analysts have their doubts.
``Investment banking more than any other is becoming global and the
idea of having a niche operation the size of Barclays Capital
strikes me as unlikely,'' said an analyst at a big American
investment bank, who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Another big question mark hanging over Barclays is its plan of
action for Continental Europe, where a flurry of banking mergers
has reinforced a sense of upheaval since last January's arrival of
the European single currency, the euro. In that domain, Sir Peter
seemed almost deliberately vague. While he said Barclays has
``designs on Europe'' and is seeking to expand its presence there,
he suggested that Continental Europe is playing catch-up to British
banking, rather than leading the way into a new era.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consolidation that's taking place in Europe is of a sort
we have already done here,'' he said. ``What's taking place in
Europe is consolidation within countries, not between them.'' He
didn't rule out future acquisitions by Barclays, but said none were
``on the horizon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The big issue in Europe is when trans-border business is going
to be easier than it is now,'' he said. ``If things there would fit
our European ambitions at a reasonable price and we could get a
reasonable return, we are interested.'' The question is whether
Barclays can afford to be so laid-back when European banking is
seething with euro-driven consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   Even more than abroad, Barclays faces challenges at home, where
established banks confront a basic problem of maintaining expensive
retail branches while newcomers cherry-pick their most lucrative
businesses. For the past decade, Britain's building societies, or
savings-and-loans institutions, have been turning themselves into
banks by providing not just mortgages, an area where Barclays is
weak, but also over-the-counter retail services, where it is
traditionally strong.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, upstarts as far afield as supermarkets and
Richard Branson's Virgin Group have been offering financial
services. Some are even offering telephone banking. ``Everyone from
Tesco (a supermarket chain) to Virgin to building societies is
getting into the banking business,'' said one Barclays executive.
``There's been a complacency among bankers that says: People don't
change their banks. But what's happening is that they may keep
their checking accounts with you and be buying products somewhere
else.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, May 7 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: MCCAIN
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday failed to pass a measure that would have
authorized President Clinton to use ``all necessary force,''
including ground troops, to resolve the conflict in Kosovo. Voting
78-22, the Senate tabled, or set aside, the proposal that was
offered by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. Supporters of the proposal
said Clinton needs to implement a tougher strategy in Kosovo
because the air strikes are not working. Opponents of the proposal
said it was premature and too broad. A ``yes'' vote favors setting
aside the proposal.

   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: BANKRUPTCY
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 313-108, a bill intended to
make it more difficult for debtors to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy,
which basically wipes out all debts. Under this bill, more people
would be forced to file Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which allows people
to keep their assets, but requires them to pay off as many debts as
possible within a certain time frame. Supporters said action needs
to be taken to stop the rising number of personal bankruptcies.
Opponents said the measure unfairly implements a ``means test,''
which determines what kind of bankruptcy debtors must file for
based on their income. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: OFFSETS
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday rejected, 101-322, an amendment to the
Kosovo emergency spending bill that would have required Congress to
pay for the $13.1 billion bill by cutting funds from other
government programs. Supporters said the government should not raid
the projected Social Security surplus to pay for the measure.
Opponents said offsetting the costs would defeat the purpose of an
emergency spending bill, which does not have to abide by spending
caps, according to budget rules. A ``yes'' vote favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: LESS FUNDS
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday rejected, 164-260, an amendment to the
Kosovo emergency spending bill that would have pared down the cost
from $13.1 billion to $11.7 billion. Supporters said the original
bill was too loaded down with non-emergency spending measures.
Opponents said the military needs the full $13.1 billion to carry
out the mission in Kosovo. A ``yes'' vote favors the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: GROUND
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday rejected, 117-301, an amendment to the
Kosovo emergency spending bill that would have prevented President
Clinton from using the $13.1 billion for ground troops unless he
first sought congressional authorization. Supporters said Clinton
needs to involve Congress when making decisions regarding the
troops in Kosovo. Opponents said the amendment was inappropriate
and could cause a presidential veto. A ``yes'' vote favors the
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   5) BILL NUMBER: FUNDING
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 311-105, a $13.1 billion
emergency spending bill that will fund the conflict in Kosovo
through September. The final amount more than doubles President
Clinton's initial funding request of $6.05 billion. Supporters said
Congress should send the troops in the Balkans whatever resources
they need to safely carry out their mission, even if members do not
agree with Clinton's handling of the conflict. Opponents said the
bill is too loaded down with non-emergency spending requests, such
as military construction projects and pay raises, and will further
sap the Social Security fund. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

 LONDON: somewhere else. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``At the heart of all this is a real sea change in the way we
deliver services to our customers,'' the executive said. ``Banks
have to become more like consumer companies, and orient themselves
to the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem that the next CEO will have to tackle is costs.
Even as competition intensifies, costs keep going up, surging 5
percent last year as the bank coped with an internal
reorganization, the introduction of the euro and the upgrading of
its computers to avoid glitches associated with the year 2000 bug.
Barclays says it will hold the line on costs this year, but
analysts are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   The most momentous decision confronting O'Neill's successor will
be whether to follow the lead of other big American and European
banks and seek out a merger partner. In recent years, there has
been frequent talk of potential mergers with suitors like
Lloyds-TSB, Britain's largest bank; Standard Chartered, and the
Royal Bank of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Barclays appears in no hurry to act. The thrust of its recent
moves has been to set its own house in order, maximize the value of
its brand and broaden the range of its consumer products. ``The
organization is not vulnerable in any classic sense,'' said Simon
Samuels, a banking analyst with Salomon Smith Barney here.
</P>
<P>
   Barclays insists that, far from losing its way, it is very much
on track. Despite its losses in Russia last year, profits surged 12
percent to 1.9 billion pounds ($3.1 billion). And the news is good
on many other fronts:
</P>
<P>
   _ The bank's Barclaycard credit-card division, long under siege
by American intruders, has launched an aggressive campaign to claw
back market share by lowering the interest rates it charges and
cutting costs by reducing its staff.
</P>
<P>
   _ Barclays Global Investment is flourishing as the world's
biggest money manager, with 370 billion pounds ($603.03 billion)
under management. It handles $407 billion in investors' money in
the United States, making it the No. 2 fund manager there after the
giant Fidelity Investments, with $765 billion.
</P>
<P>
   _ Barclays executives insist that Barclays Capital has swung
back into the black, thanks largely to the revival of world stock
and bond markets.
</P>
<P>
   _ The retail financial-services branch, the core of Barclays'
business, is luring customers with new products like Internet
banking. It is also working on redesigning its branches and is
exploring ways to offer its customers a wider range of products,
such as the ``B2'' savings account for younger depositors,
introduced last year.
</P>
<P>
   But all of that simply isn't enough in today's cutthroat banking
environment. ``From the strategy view-point, one feels that
Barclays is at a cross-roads,'' said Samuel Theodore, managing
director for European banking at Moody's Investors Services here.
What Barclays must do, he said, is become ``a more nimble
provider'' of retail financial services tailored to the needs of
customers. What that could mean, executives say, is a quest for
acquisitions giving Barclays a bigger presence in mortgages and
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Peter says the search for a new chief executive could take
another six weeks. But he insists that Barclays isn't looking for a
savior, for the simple reason that it isn't in need of salvation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crises are only crises if you think they are,'' he said.
Compared with some of the predicaments that beset the British
Treasury in his years there as permanent secretary, he added,
Barclays' recent tribulations ``don't even get onto the Richter
scale.''

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT GIVES SENATE COMMITTEE SOME DOCUMENTS ON
HOLBROOKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is trying to
determine whether it has sufficient evidence from the Justice
Department to go forward with confirmation hearings for Richard
Holbrooke as the top American diplomat at the United Nations,
congressional officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The committee chairman, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., has refused to
schedule a hearing on the long-stalled nomination until he has
received a variety of documents from the Justice Department about
its ethics investigation of Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the department provided at least some of the
documents to Helms. ``We are hopeful that this will resolve the
issue,'' a spokesman for the department, Myron Marlin, said. He did
not describe the documents.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Helms had no comment on whether the documents
were sufficient to satisfy the chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The requested documents included witnesses' statements in the
inquiry of Holbrooke's contacts with State Department officials
after he resigned from the department in 1996 and joined an
investment banking concern in New York.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic congressional official who insisted on anonymity
said that the Justice Department and White House were holding some
of the documents, but that Senate investigators were extremely
likely to gain access to all the papers by the middle of next week.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department investigation ended in February, when
Holbrooke agreed to pay the department $5,000 to settle civil
charges that he had violated lobbying laws in his contacts with the
U.S. Embassy in South Korea in 1996. He denied wrongdoing and said
he had agreed to the settlement to avoid delays in his nomination.

A WEB SITE FOR YEAR 2000 PROBLEMS

</P>
<P>
   Personal computer users worried about whether their devices can
handle year 2000 dates will have a single industry-sponsored
Internet site to turn to for answers starting Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The site (www.pcy2000.org) has been set up by an alliance of the
nation's largest PC manufacturers, including Compaq, Dell, IBM,
Hewlett-Packard, Acer and Gateway, and manufacturers of the BIOS
(Basic Input/Output System) microchips that keep time when such
computers are switched on.
</P>
<P>
   The site will define year 2000 problems in PC hardware and
provide free tests. It will also link to all the manufacturers' Web
sites and to sites that will advise consumers on how to deal with
potential PC software and data storage problems.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance members said that the site was a response to reports
that many owners of home computers and small businesses have been
paralyzed by confusion over how to deal with the possibility that
some computers and programs might malfunction when encountering
year 2000 dates.
</P>
<P>
   Computers have long used two-digit years in dates _ like 99 for
1999 _ but some cannot recognize 00 as a valid year or mistakenly
read it as 1900 instead of 2000. &QL;

RELIGION COLUMN: THE ELECTORATE'S OVERLOOKED CORNERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to political activity by religious believers, the
nation's evangelical Protestants often seem to get most of the
attention from the news media and scholars.
</P>
<P>
   That would be because evangelicals, particularly the many
conservatives among them, have clearly emerged as a political force
over the last 20 years, aided in part by media-wise organizations
like the Moral Majority and, more recently, the Christian
Coalition. As a result, they have made an impact on the Republican
Party, often pressing causes like efforts to restrict abortion.
</P>
<P>
   But this circumstance should not obscure a larger picture about
religion and politics or, says one expert, keep reporters and
scholars from paying close attention to other Protestants _ the
mainline variety, like Methodists and Presbyterians _ who could
play an important role in next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   That suggestion came, in a telephone interview, from John C.
Green, director of the Ray C. Bliss Institute of Applied Politics
at the University of Akron, who delivered a paper last week
analyzing various political data related to religious groups. (The
data were drawn from the University of Michigan's National
Elections Studies and a poll on ``values'' by The Washington Post
and the Kaiser Family Foundation.)
</P>
<P>
   Green's paper, presented at the Center for the Study of Religion
and Public Life at Trinity College in Hartford, Conn., described
the outlooks and complex voting patterns that prevailed among
Protestants, Roman Catholics, Jews and unaffiliated ``seculars'' in
the 1994, 1996 and 1998 elections.
</P>
<P>
   He had enough data to divide each of the three largest groups
(evangelicals, mainline Protestants and Catholics) into two general
categories: the ``traditionalists,'' meaning people who maintain a
high level of religious observance and accord the Bible a high
authority, and the ``nontraditionalists,'' a varied group including
theological liberals, moderates and people who say they are not
highly observant.
</P>
<P>
   Green found that Republican candidates had done much better than
Democrats with the religious traditionalists as a whole, while
Democrats had drawn most of their support from nontraditionalists,
seculars, Jews, Hispanic Catholics and African-American
Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelical Protestants accounted for nearly one-third of
Republican voters during 1994-98, Green said. During that period,
Democrats' largest voting blocs were seculars, nontraditionalist
Catholics and black Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   As for mainline Protestants as a whole, Green found that they
accounted for 16 percent of the electorate _ somewhat less than the
evangelicals, who accounted for about a fifth _ with 11 percent
fitting in the nontraditionalist category and 5 percent in the
traditionalist.
</P>
<P>
   A slight majority of mainline Protestants identify themselves as
Republicans, the historic affiliation of these voters. But the
nontraditionalists have lately been ticket-splitters, a majority
backing President Clinton in 1996 but voting for Republicans for
Congress in each of the elections from 1994 through 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Green said Clinton appealed to these people with his talk of a
``new covenant,'' of shared responsibility for society between
government and citizens. As president, he renewed his appeal in
1996 by pushing government interest in school uniforms and higher
academic standards, Green said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These folks seem to have become comfortable with a large
public sector,'' he said. ``But they don't want it to get bigger,
and they want it to be efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Why are they important? Mainline Protestants are especially
numerous in the Upper Midwest, a broad area rich in Electoral
College votes running, Green said, ``from western Pennsylvania
through Iowa, and you could probably include Nebraska and Kansas.''
</P>
<P>
   Were certain social issues to play a major role in the next
election, a candidate might find it hard to appeal to those
Protestants and other religious voters, too. For example, most
mainline Protestants oppose school vouchers, while most
evangelicals and Catholics support them, the data show.
</P>
<P>
   Green's report also points to common ground: a majority of
voters in all religious groups say they favor protecting
homosexuals from job discrimination, although most also say they do
not support gay marriage. And a majority in all groups say they
believe that government should reduce poverty, one of several
responses that lead Green to say he sees no evidence of ``culture
war'' among Americans over economic issues.

IN SYRIA, 2 WHO DECIDED TO HAVE THE KNOT TIED FOR THEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria _ Mohammed wanted a wife who was ``obedient and
beautiful.'' Olaa wanted a husband who was ``tall, kind, rich and
cultivated.'' Armed with those instructions, their mothers went to
work in search of a match.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed's stepmother visited 150 homes; Olaa poured coffee day
after day as her mother received such callers. It took two years
for their trajectories to cross, and that first visit was followed
by a second, this time with Mohammed in tow.
</P>
<P>
   ``My stepmother did a good job,'' said Mohammed, who married
Olaa four months later, at the age of 33, and counts himself lucky
that he is among the Syrians who owe their unions to the
bride-seeking ritual.
</P>
<P>
   About half of all Syrian marriages are arranged, even some for
people like Mohammed, a university graduate who has traveled in
Europe and speaks four languages.
</P>
<P>
   Syria is certainly the Arab world's most secular state, tolerant
of its large Christian population and bordering on libertine in
some ways, particularly at the Damascus nightclubs that feature
risque shows. But when it comes to men and women, people like
Mohammed and Olaa say, traditions run deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I walk into the kitchen, that's shame for me,'' Mohammed
said, ``because that is not a man's place. If I let my wife go
outside alone, that's shame for me. I know this is wrong, not
right. But it's our tradition; it's in my blood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's not tradition,'' said Olaa, who was married at 17 and
now, at 23, is the mother of two boys. ``It's jealousy.''
</P>
<P>
   A long talk with Mohammed, a thoughtful tour guide, and Olaa, a
housewife who said she felt trapped, opened a rare window on Syrian
society. Tensions between the old and the modern were exposed in
the bride-seeking ritual _ performed in Damascus with a fealty that
died out years ago in many other Arab capitals.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed in their cramped Damascus apartment, the two spoke
frankly for several hours over Arabic coffee and Marlboro
cigarettes, seated beneath a bookshelf that included works by Camus
and Voltaire. But they would speak about their marriage only on
condition that they not be photographed and that their full names
not be used. They said they first wanted to protect their families'
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, even though they would not discuss politics, they
did not want to invite scrutiny from Syrian authorities, who tend
to frown on citizens' talking to foreign journalists without
government permission.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Mohammed nor Olaa said they had any qualms about the
ritual that brought them together; their families, they said, had
their best interests at heart. The marriage may have been arranged,
they said, but it had not been imposed. Both the prospective bride
and the groom have the opportunity to turn down any match.
</P>
<P>
   But tradition is clearly a point of friction in other ways,
particularly when Olaa tries to persuade Mohammed to allow her to
return to school or to take a job, and hears him repeat what her
father told her when she was a teen-ager: ``Your university is your
home; your university is your children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to take our tradition softly,'' Mohammed said,
admitting to feeling torn. ``I want my wife to be able to live her
life and to go outside the home, but something inside me tells me,
`No!'''
</P>
<P>
   Olaa was just 15, and in her second year of high school in 1991,
she said, when her father, a dentist, and her mother first asked
whether she was willing to begin considering suitors. An only
daughter, she had been sheltered, always wore a head scarf and was
not allowed even to walk to and from school.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Olaa immediately said yes, and the process began,
following rules and customs understood by everyone in Damascus. At
single-sex gatherings, Olaa would be appraised by the mothers of
marriageable sons, who would later telephone to invite themselves
over for a coffee-and-cakes meeting with the young woman and her
mother. A blow-by-blow description would then be carried home to
the absent suitor.
</P>
<P>
   As Mohammed pointed out, the mother of the prospective bride
might ask questions about his ``keys'' _ to an apartment, a car or
a villa outside of town. If the man was interested in meeting the
young woman in person, the mother would propose a second visit,
this time including her son.
</P>
<P>
   But Olaa and her family did not approve of any of the early
candidates, so the requests were always deflected, according to
form, with the news that she had decided to ``continue her
studies.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Mohammed was ready to find a wife, also in 1991, he
was already 31, old by Syrian standards, but not unusually so for a
man these days, because the economy has made it difficult to become
financially established. He had a girlfriend in college, a
Christian, but knew that his parents believed a marriage should be
arranged _ and to a fellow Muslim. And so after graduating from
Damascus University in 1985 and completing his mandatory military
service, he worked ``day and night'' to save the money necessary to
make himself an attractive candidate.
</P>
<P>
   He asked for a wife with blond hair and blue eyes, a rare
combination in Syria. But his stepmother (his mother died young)
took her mission to heart, calling on as many as two families a
week, and arranging at least 60 times for him to join her on a
second visit.
</P>
<P>
   Invariably, Mohammed said, he would glimpse his prospective
bride for the first time as she entered the room, to serve coffee;
there would be time for only a few words of shy conversation. In
two years of looking, Mohammed decided seven times that he would be
happy with the match, only to be refused.
</P>
<P>
   There was no such obstacle when it came to Olaa. She remembers
peering from an upstairs window to see whether Mohammed was indeed
tall and whether he arrived for the second visit in a taxi, a car
or a bus. (He drove a black Volkswagen Golf.) When their eyes met,
both Mohammed and Olaa say, they felt the same happy surge.
</P>
<P>
   After the visit, as their families huddled separately to compare
notes, each announced that it would be satisfied with the match. A
few anxious moments remained. When Mohammed's stepmother requested
the customary third meeting, to discuss the dowry, she was
temporarily rebuffed, as is usual in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   This allowed for Olaa's father to question Mohammed's neighbors.
Did he go to the mosque? Did he drink? Was he a good man? The
answers were satisfactory, so a third meeting took place, but not
without a final bit of brinkmanship. Acting on his instructions,
Mohammed's stepmother told Olaa's father that her son could afford
no more than $4,000 of the requested $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   Uncertain of the outcome, Mohammed arrived at Olaa's house as
the third meeting was finally taking place. Her father greeted him
as a son. As a welcoming gesture, the father even pulled off his
daughter's scarf, so that her husband-to-be could glimpse her hair
(not blond, but no matter) _ a move so brazen that Olaa cried out
with shame.
</P>
<P>
   The couple were married soon afterward, and the consummation of
the marriage was announced jointly the next morning by their
mothers. Their ululations, a final taste of tradition, were to
celebrate that the bride had indeed been a virgin, as proven by the
discovery of a bloodstained sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Since Mohammed and Olaa became husband and wife, tradition has
sometimes been their foe. Mohammed says his father's advice that a
wife should be made to fear her husband has sometimes led him
astray. He has tried to be easier, allowing his wife to get a
driver's license and even to attend all-women computer classes.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea that she should be allowed to work with men, or
even attend classes with them, is one that he still cannot brook.
``You know what it says in the Koran,'' Mohammed said, as Olaa
rolled her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a man and woman are together, the third one is the
devil.''

JENNY-ASSESS (Phoenix) - The suggestion to fix our culture in the
wake of the Littleton, Colo., killings is to teach media literacy
to our citizens. The idea: Had the cold-blooded killers understood
that TV shows and music and computer games aren't real _ had they
been intellectually equipped to passionlessly process the messages
they got from their entertainment choices _ perhaps there would now
be no grieving. Though it likely wouldn't have averted what
happened at Columbine High, media-literacy education for all is an
excellent idea. In the wake of Friday's verdict in ``The Jenny
Jones Show'' case, let's move right along to Lesson One. By DAVE
WALKER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
LEIBOWITZ-COLUMN (Phoenix) - There we were in mid-workout, each of
us on a Stairmaster. Well, actually, I was on the machine. Blondie
was on her cell phone. What followed was a hot debate on the
subject of cell-phone etiquette. Welcome to the new millenium,
where we, citizens who demand chitchat-free personal space, will
take back our restaurants, ballgames, produce aisles, theaters and
Stairmasters. By DAVID LEIBOWITZ. Story moved in the ``K''

BUFFALO-MUSEUM (Scottsdale, Ariz.) - Buffalo roam at Gemmie Baker's
insurance office. For more than 40 years, Baker has collected
buffalo memorabilia. You name it, he has it: ceramics, pelts, movie
posters, china, silver spoons, miniatures, taxidermy. Eight years
ago, Baker founded the Buffalo Museum of America in Scottsdale. His
insurance office takes up one corner of the first floor. The museum
sprawls across the rest of the two-story rented space. He says it's
the only place like it in the world. By BARBARA YOST. Story will

 &HT;    Jewish visitors to Tirana return with tales of need
 &HT;    By Tim O'Meilia
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PLAM BEACH, Fla. _ When war doesn't intrude, the area
outside the Albanian capital city of Tirana is a summer swimming
camp.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is an instant city of 5,000, a camp of mostly ethnic
Albanians forced out of neighboring Kosovo. A city of tents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lift the flap on a tent _ hardly bigger than a pup tent _ and
10 people are living inside,'' said Mark Levy of West Palm Beach.
Mostly they are women, children and old men. ``They don't know
where their men are _ killed or forced to work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Levy and Norman Goldblum of Palm Beach, vice presidents of the
Jewish Federation of Palm Beach County, returned Friday from a
five-day trip to Israel and Eastern Europe that took them on a
whirlwind 22-hour visit to the refugee camp and to Budapest,
Hungary, where Jews have fled from the bombing in Belgrade,
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Goldblum, Levy and 28 others from American Jewish groups flew on
a relief mission from Israel to Albania with 20 tons of food,
medicine, blankets and bigger, waterproof tents.
</P>
<P>
   The local pair brought soap, shampoo, other toilet articles and
toys to add to the effort. Their mission is to tell what they saw
and encourage the Jewish community to donate to relief efforts.
American Jews have donated $2.25 million for Kosovo relief,
according to the United Jewish Communities, formerly the United
Jewish Appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish Agency for Israel manages half of the camp and has
relocated 400 mostly Muslim ethnic Albanian refugees. ``A lot want
to be close to the border so they can return quickly to find their
families,'' said Goldblum, 75.
</P>
<P>
   More important than the one bucket of water a day each refugee
gets is the bulletin board outside the camp entrance that lists the
name of everyone in camp. The refugees check often for the names of
missing relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real problem is that when they do go home, they have no
homes to go to. Something has to be done now before the cold
weather sets in,'' said Levy, 44.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans also visited a Jewish-owned hotel in Budapest that
has become the refugee center for Yugoslavian Jews who have fled
from Belgrade. The plane took 32 of them back to Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every story was overwhelming. Every story heart-rending,''
Goldblum said. ``The need is so massive that whatever you do, it's
not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy said the Israeli and Jewish relief effort is entirely
humanitarian and has no political implications. ``This is the same
thing that happened 50 years ago,'' Levy said. ``We've got to get
over there and help people.''

JONES VERDICT SEEN A WARNING FOR TALK SHOWS, JOURNALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects spelling of Klieman in penultimate graf; a and e
coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Michigan jury found ``The Jenny Jones Show'' negligent in the
murder of a guest on the program, in a ruling decried by First
Amendment advocates and seen as an ominous warning about public
anger not only at trash TV, but at the increasingly murky mix of
entertainment and journalism.
</P>
<P>
   The $25 million verdict stemmed from a Jenny Jones episode in
which one guest, Scott Amedure, revealed himself as the secret
admirer of another guest, Jonathan Schmitz. Three days after the
March 1995 taping, an apparently humiliated Schmitz shot and killed
Amedure. He is currently awaiting retrial after a 1996 murder
conviction was thrown out on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Jones's ill-fated, secret admirer show seemed ``unusual and
extreme, even by talk television standards,'' said television
historian Alex McNeil. And it was hard to find anyone with a kind
word for the brand of video voyeurism that the jury penalized with
its verdict Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But many observers believe that decision is more than simply a
repudiation of junk programming. They interpret it as part of a
public backlash against a range of media outlets that produce
everything from outrageous TV talk shows to serious investigative
journalism.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a jury found ABC liable for $5.5 million in damages
after it used undercover reporters to unearth allegedly unsanitary
conditions at the Food Lion supermarket chain. Last year, The
Cincinnati Enquirer's use of purloined voice mails in an expose of
Chiquita Brands company spawned a major criminal investigation of
the paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reaction (to the Jones verdict) is first that it's another
sign that the public is angry at the `media at large,' &UR;  &LR; '' said Tom
Rosenstiel, director of the Center for Excellence in Journalism.
``And it's a warning signal to journalists that that the public in
some manner...wants to hold us accountable for consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether Jenny Jones is a journalist or not...any journalist
should recognize that there's a message here for them,'' he added.
``Increasingly, there is a blending of the media. What's the
difference between Oprah's book review and The New York Times book
review?''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Paratone, president of Telepictures Productions, which
produces ``Jenny Jones,'' announced his intention to appeal, noting
that the ``public and every single media outlet should fear the
chilling effect of this verdict.'' Some analysts seemed to agree.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney and civil liberties proponent Harvery Silverglate
harbors few illusions about the value of the Jones show, noting
that the ``the history of incursions into the First Amendment is
(that) they pick on the medium that doesn't have respectable public
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he compared the verdict to ``the other cases that
have arisen where courts have attacked the techniques by which news
has been gathered. ... There is a continuum that goes from what we
would agree is hard news to entertainment. We're talking about one
phenomenon. You can not, as a legal matter, distinguish between
Jenny Jones and The Boston Globe.''
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of Friday's news, McNeil wondered whether as
``the next step, you'll see in a TV crime show a particular type of
crime committed. Then someone goes out and replicates that style of
crime'' and a case is brought to prove the ``causation link between
the television depiction and the action the defendant took.''
</P>
<P>
   Court TV anchor Rikki Klieman pointed to the performance of
plaintiffs' attorney Geoffrey Fieger _ who gained fame as Jack
Kevorkian's lawyer _ in convincing the jurors. But she also
contended that the tricky First Amendment issue and ``proximate
cause'' theory (that the show was responsible for the subsequent
murder) ought to keep the matter in the courts for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly think they have viable issues on appeal,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The jury's $25-million repudiation of the Jones show comes at a
time when some analysts think the hardcore talk TV wave _ pioneered
by people like Morton Downey Jr. and Geraldo Rivera and now
championed by Jerry Springer _ may have crested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Springer took it to its illogical extreme,'' said
cultural critic Steven Stark, who points to success of such kinder
gentler talk show hosts as Oprah Winfrey and Rosie O`Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   The Jones verdict ``probably will be seen as a turning point,''
that helped cool public ardor for trash television, added McNeil.
</P>
<P>
   Still, such predictions are at least partly refuted by Klieman's
explanation of why the Jones case was one of Court TV's
highest-rated trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have sex, you have murder, you have possible
homosexuality. Then you've got Feiger. This would have made a
great-made-for-TV movie.'' And a darn good Jenny Jones show.

JOBLESSNESS RATE UNEXPECTEDLY EDGES UP IN GERMANY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ In a worrisome sign that Europe's biggest
economy is still sputtering, the German government reported an
unexpectedly big monthly jump Friday in the German joblessness.
</P>
<P>
   After declining slowly for more than a year, the seasonally
adjusted unemployment rate here edged up to 10.7 percent in April
from 10.6 percent in March, according to a report from the central
bank, the Bundesbank.
</P>
<P>
   Although the change was fairly small, it surprised many
economists who had been expecting either no change or a
continuation of recent improvement. It also pointed to renewed
pressure on Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who has come under
widespread criticism from industrialists for what they call his
listless economic program.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, which accounts for about one-quarter of western
Europe's economic output, now has one of the slowest rates of
economic growth in the region. The government itself recently
scaled back its revisions for growth this year from more than 2
percent to 1.5 percent. That puts it on a par with Italy and
significantly behind most other neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The German Federal Labor Office reported Friday that the
unadjusted rate of unemployment declined from 11.1 percent in April
to 10.7 percent in March. But government officials acknowledged
that most of that increase was due to the normal increase in hiring
that takes place in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   The economic picture is unusually muddled. Government officials
and many economists believe that a mild recovery may have begun,
fueled by lower borrowing costs from the European Central Bank and
the relatively weak value of the euro, Europe's new single
currency, which is stimulating European exports.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Friday's numbers reinforced the sense that European
unemployment will remain stubbornly high. German industrial
executives are hoping for a lift from a number of signs that Asia
and Latin America are recovering from their financial crises, which
had deeply depressed exports of machinery, chemicals and other
products ever since last summer.
</P>
<P>
   But even if German growth does accelerate, nobody expects
anything more than a mild improvement for the rest of this year.
Some experts worry that joblessness will remain high because
Schroeder's center-left government has stiffened Germany's already
rigid work rules and pushed through tax increases on business.

FACING GROWING COMPETITION, INSTINET SCRAMBLES FOR POSITION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kan.)   By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the competition intensifying for America's stock-trading
business, Instinet, a unit of the Reuters Group PLC and the
nation's largest private electronic stock-trading network,
announced a series of strategic moves last week aimed, not only at
its competitors but also at its potential allies.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Instinet announced that it had organized a
consortium to buy a 54.4 percent stake in Tradepoint Financial
Networks PLC, a tiny British electronic stock market that recently
got permission from the Securities and Exchange Commission to
accept orders directly from American money-managers.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium includes American Century, the Kansas City mutual
fund giant; Archipelago, an electronic communications network, or
ECN, whose co-owners include Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. and E-Trade
Group; and two global investment banks, J.P. Morgan and Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   Tradepoint has highly regarded technology _ its chief appeal to
the consortium _ but until now it has lacked the trading volume
necessary to earn a profit. It handles only about 1 percent of
London's trading and has consistently lost money. The consortium's
$22-million investment provides a nice life jacket, but the real
reward for Tradepoint is the promise of trading business from
consortium members, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the deal make Tradepoint a stronger competitor in
the European market, it also signals a provocative shift in
Instinet's role in the American market.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Instinet has been discussing some sort of electronic
alliance with both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, as those
traditional markets try to compete with the growing ECN community.
The Big Board wants a share of the trading in Nasdaq's hot Internet
stocks, and Nasdaq is trying to retrieve business it has lost to
the ECN's.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, Douglas M. Atkin, the chief executive of Instinet,
said he was now far less interested in an individual partnership
with one of the giant exchanges, unless it was aimed at forming a
single domestic electronic trading network that mirrors Tradepoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that is what our markets need,'' said Atkin. ``Even
if one exchange wanted to do a deal with Instinet as a single
partner, we don't really think that's the way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Atkin conceded that his vision of a unified electronic market
ran counter to the current proliferation of competing electronic
services. ``But I think the tide is shifting,'' he added. ``We
would much prefer the natural parties _ Nasdaq or the NYSE _ to be
putting this together,'' he said. ``But Tradepoint guarantees that
there is a very significant third option if the other parties don't
act.''
</P>
<P>
   Instinet also opened a new front on Wednesday in its battle with
its smaller competitors by announcing that it was talking to a
handful of online and traditional brokers about the possibility of
opening its electronic trading system to individual investors. It
is the dominant non-exchange trading service for institutional
investors, but this step would put it in more direct competition
with the ECN's, like The Island ECN, that have cultivated brokers
serving the retail customer.

JONES VERDICT SEEN A WARNING FOR TALK SHOWS, JOURNALISTS

that the ``public and every single media outlet should fear the
chilling effect of this verdict.'' Some analysts seemed to agree.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney and civil liberties proponent Harvery Silverglate
harbors few illusions about the value of the Jones show, noting
that the ``the history of incursions into the First Amendment is
(that) they pick on the medium that doesn't have respectable public
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he compared the verdict to ``the other cases that
have arisen where courts have attacked the techniques by which news
has been gathered. ... There is a continuum that goes from what we
would agree is hard news to entertainment. We're talking about one
phenomenon. You can not, as a legal matter, distinguish between
Jenny Jones and The Boston Globe.''
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of Friday's news, McNeil wondered whether as
``the next step, you'll see in a TV crime show a particular type of
crime committed. Then someone goes out and replicates that style of
crime'' and a case is brought to prove the ``causation link between
the television depiction and the action the defendant took.''
</P>
<P>
   Court TV anchor Rikki Klieman pointed to the performance of
plaintiffs' attorney Geoffrey Fieger _ who gained fame as Jack
Kevorkian's lawyer _ in convincing the jurors. But she also
contended that the tricky First Amendment issue and ``proximate
cause'' theory (that the show was responsible for the subsequent
murder) ought to keep the matter in the courts for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly think they have viable issues on appeal,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The jury's $25-million repudiation of the Jones show comes at a
time when some analysts think the hardcore talk TV wave _ pioneered
by people like Morton Downey Jr. and Geraldo Rivera and now
championed by Jerry Springer _ may have crested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Springer took it to its illogical extreme,'' said
cultural critic Steven Stark, who points to success of such kinder
gentler talk show hosts as Oprah Winfrey and Rosie O`Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   The Jones verdict ``probably will be seen as a turning point,''
that helped cool public ardor for trash television, added McNeil.
</P>
<P>
   Still, such predictions are at least partly refuted by Klieman's
explanation of why the Jones case was one of Court TV's
highest-rated trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have sex, you have murder, you have possible
homosexuality. Then you've got Feiger. This would have made a
great-made-for-TV movie.'' And a darn good Jenny Jones show.

HINGIS ROUTS SERENA WILLIAMS TO AVENGE EARLIER LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Martina Hingis and Serena Williams walked on court as
equals Friday in the quarterfinals of the Italian Open, but when
they walked off little more than an hour later, it was clear that
Hingis was No. 1 and Williams still has a little way to go.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis had wanted a measure of revenge after losing to Williams
in Key Biscayne, Fla., and she got it by the surprisingly
convincing score of 6-2, 6-2. But then, the score will be a
surprise only to those who did not watch this mismatch of a
rematch.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't win; I gave it to her,'' Williams said. ``I hit so
many errors. It was absolutely absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' analysis was far superior to her performance, and now
it will be up to her sister, Venus, to try to give the Williams
family its first victory over Hingis on clay. Venus Williams earned
a date with Hingis in Saturday's semifinals by defeating Dominique
Van Roost, 7-6 (7-1), 6-2, Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beating the whole family all the time, it's not easy,'' Hingis
conceded.
</P>
<P>
   The first part of the task was certainly easier than expected.
What has come so naturally to Serena Williams in the past three
months, when she has regularly dominated opponents with her
attacking baseline play, looked agonizingly difficult this
afternoon. Instead of crisp winners and overwhelming first serves
and well-timed forays to the net, there was the sort of overhitting
and impatient play that occasionally got Williams into trouble
during her first two years on tour.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis won 16 of the first 17 points to jump out to a 4-0 lead,
and the only point Williams won during that slightly surreal
stretch came on a Hingis double fault. The match was never that
lopsided again, but Williams' fundamental failings would change
little: inconsistency from the backcourt and a very poor
first-service percentage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a really weird day,'' the 10th-ranked Williams
said. ``I thought I was playing well here. I was pretty much on a
roll. It's kind of weird to walk into a match and not be able to do
the things you've done for so long. I can't really explain that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, visibly and audibly delighted after her victory, had an
explanation of her own: ``On clay, you can't just kill the ball,
because it's going to come back over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   On clay, a parabola is often a wiser path to choose for your
balls than a relatively straight line, and despite the occasional
effort to rediscover her lost rhythm by taking pace off the ball
and adding topspin, Williams frequently ignored that slow-court
principle. The result was not pretty: 40 unforced errors to Hingis'
10, which was also testimony to the Swiss star's sound tactics. She
aimed most of her shots in the direction of Serena's backhand and,
in the precious few extended rallies, picked her spots and changed
pace astutely.
</P>
<P>
   Those tactics were perhaps refined after an impromptu and
unprecedented practice session with Williams earlier in the week.
Usually, Serena and Venus Williams are each other's practice
partners, but Venus Williams was still in Hamburg, Germany, playing
and winning a tournament, and Serena Williams chose to train with
Hingis, the sisters' principal rival.
</P>
<P>
   For Hingis, Friday's overwhelming victory _ which gave her a 3-1
career edge over Serena Williams _ sprang from the same source as
Venus Williams' overwhelming, 6-2, 6-2, victory over Anna
Kournikova the night before. ``Mentally, we were stronger, me and
Venus,'' Hingis said.
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams has not yet proved strong enough to defeat Hingis
in a Grand Slam event or on clay. Last year, she lost to Hingis
here in the final and then lost to her again on clay in the
quarterfinals of the French Open. They have not played since, and
though Venus Williams has now won 17 of her last 18 matches, Hingis
looks fit and fresh after a four-week layoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``She won Wimbledon, the U.S. Open and got to the finals of the
French; I've never done these things,'' Williams said. ``She must
be doing something right. I guess she's comfortable on clay. She
grew up on it, so maybe that's an advantage to her.''
</P>
<P>
   The other semifinal at the Foro Italico on Saturday will be an
all-French affair between Mary Pierce and Amelie Mauresmo. Pierce,
actually an American playing under the French flag, advanced by
defeating another French player, Sandrine Testud, 6-4, 7-5.
Mauresmo had an easier time with Sylvia Plischke of Austria,
winning by 6-2, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Plischke, a Czech-born polyglot who moved to Innsbruck with her
family when she was 6, upset two small players with big reputations
this week: Amanda Coetzer and the reigning French Open champion,
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario. But neither Coetzer nor Sanchez Vicario
can come close to applying the same pressure as Mauresmo when she
is in form, and the strapping, aggressive 19-year-old who came to
prominence in a hurry earlier this year by reaching the final of
the Australian Open believes that she is again approaching her peak
after a lackluster early spring on American hardcourts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, mentally and tennistically, it's all coming
together like in Australia,'' she said in her improving but still
imperfect English.

 &HT;    Nashville just like home for new Dell plant
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ It is known for its music scene, a large
population of college students and a vibrant economy. A river flows
past downtown and the tree-covered hills beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer Corp. executives say part of the reason they chose
the Nashville for their first U.S. expansion outside Texas was that
Middle Tennessee reminds them a lot of Central Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a culture that is very similar to Austin,'' Dell Vice
Chairman Kevin Rollins said this week when Dell announced it would
build a major satellite campus in Nashville. ``It had the same kind
of natural affinity for us as a company.''
</P>
<P>
   Strategically, Nashville gives Dell quicker access to markets in
the heavily populated eastern half of the United States, said Paul
Bell, who oversees Dell's Dimension PC line that will be shifted to
Nashville beginning this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But other cities offered that too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's pay Austin a compliment,'' said Bill Baxter, the
45-year-old commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Economic &AMP;
Community Development who got to know Dell executives in the past
six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were looking for another Austin.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the cities weren't exactly separated at birth.
</P>
<P>
   Austin is South-by-Southwest. Nashville is the Old South. A
plaque near the Tennessee State Capitol reminds visitors that the
United Daughters of the Confederacy was founded in Nashville in
1894.
</P>
<P>
   Grits are a staple of Nashville buffets, but Directory
Assistance doesn't have a single listing for a Starbuck's coffee
shop. And if the 15 or so managers that Dell expects to transfer to
Nashville like serrano and poblano peppers, they'd better plan on
growing their own.
</P>
<P>
   Standing near a small bin of wrinkled jalapenos, a produce
manager at a large Nashville grocery store seemed puzzled by
questions about other varieties of peppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I get 'em in, sometimes I don't,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the similarities between the two cities are hard to ignore,
from the presence of nationally ranked universities to the hot,
muggy summers.
</P>
<P>
   As cities on the move, Austin and Nashville also struggle with
tight labor markets. Middle Tennessee's unemployment rate, like
Austin's, is less than 3 percent. In fast-growing Austin, that has
provided a challenge for employers with more jobs than people to
fill them.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Fox, a researcher at the University of Tennessee's
Center for Business and Economic Research, said he doesn't believe
that will be a problem for Nashville if the new jobs associated
with Dell are added gradually.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a tight labor market, but it's also the fastest-growing
market in Tennessee,'' he said. ``Where there's jobs, people will
come.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Austin, Nashville has its own Williamson County to compete
with for jobs. Williamson County, Tenn., which is south of
Nashville, is the fastest-growing county in the state, Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee capital, like Austin, is concerned about giving up
jobs and population to surrounding counties, whose residents come
downtown to enjoy the city's amenities and use public services and
roads that their own taxes don't support. When Dell moved its
corporate headquarters from Austin to Round Rock five years ago, it
upset many Austin political and business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Austin, there is virtually no high-tech industry in the
region, other than some small software companies. But that will
change dramatically with Dell's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a 'Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval','' crowed Mayor
Phil Bredesen, the two-term mayor who played a major role in luring
the erstwhile Houston Oilers to Nashville. ``Dell's locating here
helps to focus attention on us as a city that can support
technology too.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell expects to hire 1,000 manufacturing and technical-support
employees by year end, and another 2,000 within five years. But the
whisper among public officials is that the number could reach as
high as 10,000 in five years as Dell launches an aggressive
campaign to dominate the consumer and small business segment.
</P>
<P>
   And many of Dell's 40 or so suppliers will follow it here,
adding more jobs. A study Dell paid for by the Center for Business
and Economic Research at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville
estimated that short-term construction jobs, 3,000 Dell jobs, and
hiring by Dell suppliers and others will add up to 8,550 jobs over
five years. The economic impact is estimated to be $800 million,
generating $47 million in sales tax revenue for the state, Fox
said.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning this summer, Dell will shift to Tennessee all
production, technical support and service of its Dimension PC, a
computer targeted at consumers and businesses with fewer than 400
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really love these jobs,'' Bredesen told the Metro Council
when he briefed members on the incentive package he negotiated with
Dell _ a package estimated at between between $40 million and $160
million.
</P>
<P>
   The Dell campus will be Nashville's first big manufacturing
plant since a Ford Motor Glass facility opened here in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're aggressive, no question about that,'' Bredesen said of
Dell. ``They wanted incentives, they wanted assurances and they
wanted things done yesterday.''

CLINTON HAILS BOSNIA OPERATION AS MODEL FOR PEACE KEEPING IN
KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Friday described the
peacekeeping operation in Bosnia, which includes U.S. soldiers
working under the direction of NATO with U.N. approval, as a model
for the force that is envisioned to return and protect ethnic
Albanian refugees to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that the arrangement in Bosnia was a good example
for Kosovo because it involved Russian and Ukrainian participation
even though NATO was involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did in Bosnia was functional,'' Clinton said at the
White House before leaving for Texas, where he attended
fund-raisers and then planned to travel to Oklahoma on Saturday to
see the destruction from this week's tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials declined to be specific on how closely
the Bosnia model could be copied in Kosovo, which unlike Bosnia,
remains part of Yugoslavia. But Clinton and NATO officials asserted
Friday that NATO would indeed have a role in the peacekeeping
force, despite the absence of such language in the Group of Eight
communique agreed upon on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Russians decided to agree to the communique's call
for an international force in Kosovo, they remain opposed to the
involvement of NATO, in part because, the Yugoslav president,
Slobodan Milosevic, opposes such a force.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has insisted that, among other things, a NATO force
would infringe upon the sovereignty of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Work on an international force for Kosovo will start in Moscow
when deputy secretary Strobe Talbott visits there Tuesday,
accompanied by officials from the Pentagon and the National
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade also has insisted that the United Nations be part of
any force. The secretary general of the United Nations, Kofi Annan,
met Friday at the State Department with the secretary of state,
Madeleine Albright, to discuss a U.N. Security Council resolution
that would mandate a military force in Kosovo. They also discussed
what role the United Nations would play in a civil administration
governing a post-conflict Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade Friday was likely
to complicate the hopes of winning a Security Council resolution
mandating a security force.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials have said that they hoped that
if Russia agreed to a resolution, the Chinese would follow. It was
unusual, they said, for the Chinese to object on their own to a
Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
   But the Chinese, nervous about the precedent set by NATO's
bombing of a sovereign country, have been extremely critical of the
operation in its early weeks. The bombing of their embassy is
almost certain to revive Beijing's opposition to the NATO
airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   Another complicating factor was the closeness of the Belgrade
regime to the Chinese government. In particular, Milosevic's wife,
Mira Markovic, who leads a major political party and is considered
by many to be the second most powerful figure in Yugoslavia, is
considered a great admirer of the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Annan, who is poised to take a greater role in the search for a
solution in Kosovo, announced on Friday the appointment of two
special envoys, Carl Bildt, a former Swedish Prime Minister and
Eduard Kukan, the foreign minister of Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
   But Annan had no plans to visit Belgrade, his office said.
</P>
<P>
   At their meeting in Germany on Thursday, the Group of Seven
richest nations and Russia laid the ground work for a Security
Council resolution that would endorse ``effective international
civil and security presences.''
</P>
<P>
   Western countries agreed to drop the word NATO from their
communique in order to get Russian agreement for a force with NATO
at its core in Kosovo. At the meeting in Germany, the Russian
foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, said that the security force could
not include NATO forces without Milosevic's permission.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott intends to insist in his meetings in Moscow that NATO
troops would be part of the force, administration officials said.
Beyond that, Talbott would discuss the kind of detailed command
arrangements that would permit Russia to participate.
</P>
<P>
   In Bosnia, the 1,500 Russian troops are under the command of a
Russian deputy to Gen. Wesley Clark, the supreme commander of NATO.
A similiar arrangement was feasible in Kosovo, administration
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   It was assumed, State Department officials said, that Russian
soldiers would be deployed in areas of Kosovo where Serbs rather
than ethnic Albanians are dominant.
</P>
<P>
   A critical juncture in the unfolding diplomatic process toward a
settlement in Kosovo would come after the Russian envoy, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, returned to Belgrade to talk to Milosevic about the
security force.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin is expected to go to Belgrade in the coming days,
officials in Moscow said.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Despite the stepped up diplomatic activity in the last few days,
almost of all it has been on one side and has not yet involved
Milosevic. The Yugoslav leader has said he would accept a lightly
armed U.N.-led mission and not the well-armed military force NATO
demands.
</P>
<P>
   Officials warned again Friday that the appearance of all the
negotiating between Russia and the West could give Milosevic the
impression that he could win more concessions by waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have said it would be difficult for them to
agree to a Security Council Chapter 7 resolution that allows for
the approval of a military action without the consent of the
parties.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, the Russians have not closed the door on a
Chapter 7 resolution and have suggested that they are waiting to
see what flexibility there is in Milosevic's attitude to the
security force.
</P>
<P>
   On another aspect of U.N. involvement in Kosovo once the bombing
stops, the State Department said Friday that Annan talked to
Albright about the shape and responsibilities of a civil
administration and police force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's spokesman, Jamie Rubin, said that the future of
Kosovo had to be thought about so that the plans could be ready for
when ``President Milosevic reverses course and we need to implement
the settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaborating on the kind of force that would go into Kosovo,
Rubin stressed that there would be no U.N. involvement in the
actual military operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody in the United States or any of the NATO countries
envisages the United Nations Secretariat and the blue-helmet
peacekeeping unit to play any role in the peacekeeping force,''
Rubin said. ``This would be a situation where the United Nations
Security Council, acting on behalf of the world, would authorize
member states to put together a force.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin added: ``It has to be a NATO core force, which for us
means the NATO forces must be under the command of a NATO
commander, meaning through the authority of the Supreme Allied
Commander in Europe _ period, full stop.''
</P>
<P>
   While the administration was focusing on dealing with the
Russians, there was opposition to the settlement, as outlined in
Germany, from an unexpected quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Liberation Army announced in the Albanian capital,
Tirana, that the proposed settlement was ``unacceptable'' because
it did not foresee the independence of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Bilal Sherifi, a spokesman for the guerrillas, said they opposed
a solution that preserved Kosovo as a part of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Sherifi's comments were in line with a general stiffening of the
guerrilla's demands since the expulsion from Kosovo of more than
700,000 ethnic Albanians by Milosevic in the last six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Like all other declarations by the Western allies on Kosovo, the
agreement in Germany called for the disarmament of the guerrillas
once an international security force entered the province. But in
the last several days, officials representing the guerrillas have
said they will not put down their arms.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has made no official comment on the agreement between
the Western allies and Russia on the need for an international
security force. The government run newspaper, Politika, printed the
set of principles in full on the front page Friday.

GUNS OF WYATT EARP, DOC HOLLIDAY AMONG ITEMS AT OLD WEST AUCTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JAMIE STOCKWELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PFLUGERVILLE, Texas _ David J. Hall insists he does not collect
artifacts. Rather, he collects history.
</P>
<P>
   For 60 years, Hall, a renowned author and historian of the
American West, has collected weapons, photographs, documents and
other such items pertaining to the Old West. But the 72-year-old
self-proclaimed cowboy from Wood River, Ill., recently announced
his retirement, and the immediate dispersal, at auction, of his
vast collection.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day auction, which began Friday in this small
community, is part of the 24th Annual Firearm, Art, Western and
Indian Relic Auction. Five hundred items will be auctioned each
day.
</P>
<P>
   As the auctioneer's expeditious tongue completes a bid, Hall
smiles, more to himself than to others. A Colt Lightning pistol is
sold to a man from Arizona for $900.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you can say it's all going toward my little retirement
fund,'' Hall says.
</P>
<P>
   But just because Hall has decided to part with his Western
frontier collection _ which includes Annie Oakley's lucky Indian
head penny glued onto a blue and purple ribbon that used to be
attached to her wardrobe trunk, and Doc Holliday's O.K. Corral,
10-gauge, double barreled shotgun _ does not mean his days of
collecting are over.
</P>
<P>
   Nope. Hall has a military collection to build. And a law
enforcement collection. And a Navy collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way I can stop now,'' he said. ``I'm going to keep
doing what I've been doing: collecting old things.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the estimated 150 bidders Friday afternoon was former
Texas House Speaker Gib Lewis. Lewis said he frequents most area
auctions and enjoys collecting Western artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just bought some spurs and I'm sure I'll buy more things,''
he said. ``But I'll regret it later, I'm sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the more famous, and unusual, of the 1,500 items being
auctioned this weekend include Wyatt Earp's 10-gauge shotgun from
1878, photos of Pancho Villa and his wife, Annie Oakley's engraved
silver pistol, horrific photos from the massacre of Sioux at
Wounded Knee and a framed old cardboard warning poster from the
1800s that states: ``Spitting on Sidewalk Prohibited. Penalty $10
to $200.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimated to bring $1,700 is a photograph of the sole survivor
of Gen. George Armstrong Custer's command from the battle against
the Sioux at Little Bighorn, a horse called Comanche.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a hundred stories behind all these items,'' said Tom
Burks, a consultant for Tom Keilman &AMP; Son Auctioneers.
</P>
<P>
   Also being auctioned is a large photograph collection compiled
by the late Gen. F.W. Sackett. The collection of more than 100
photographs from the 1880s includes Indian Chiefs Sitting Bull,
Geronimo and Red Cloud, Buffalo Bill and actress Lillie Langtry.
</P>
<P>
   For most of his life, Hall has collected, studied and wrote
about the artifacts of the frontier era. His collection of guns,
badges, documents, photographs and Old West memorabilia has been
exhibited in museums throughout the nation, including the
Smithsonian Institution. The Smithsonian also sponsored a
nationwide two-year tour of Hall's U.S. Marshals Exhibit, enabling
Hall to become an honorary deputy U.S. marshal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to do anything dangerous and risky and I get to
be part of the U.S. Marshals,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has worn out six or seven new cars traveling from
state to state purchasing artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't keep collecting
stuff,'' the World War II veteran said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall sat in the back corner of the Lions Hall and watched the
commotion over his collection unfold.
</P>
<P>
   With adrenaline as their primary source of energy, hands bobbed
up and down at their chance to claim a piece of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going at twelve, do I hear twelve fifty? Do I hear twelve
fifty? Sold at twelve fifty.''
</P>
<P>
   Sold. Hall sighs deeply, his face flushed with excitement. Sold.
A Colt Lightning owned by former U.S. Marshal Chris Madsen for
$12,500.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, May 7 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: MCCAIN
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday failed to pass a measure that would have
authorized President Clinton to use ``all necessary force,''
including ground troops, to resolve the conflict in Kosovo. Voting
78-22, the Senate tabled, or set aside, the proposal that was
offered by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. Supporters of the proposal
said Clinton needs to implement a tougher strategy in Kosovo
because the air strikes are not working. Opponents of the proposal
said it was premature and too broad. A ``yes'' vote favors setting
aside the proposal.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: BANKRUPTCY
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 313-108, a bill intended to
make it more difficult for debtors to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy,
which basically wipes out all debts. Under this bill, more people
would be forced to file Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which allows people
to keep their assets, but requires them to pay off as many debts as
possible within a certain time frame. Supporters said action needs
to be taken to stop the rising number of personal bankruptcies.
Opponents said the measure unfairly implements a ``means test,''
which determines what kind of bankruptcy debtors must file for
based on their income. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: OFFSETS
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday rejected, 101-322, an amendment to the
Kosovo emergency spending bill that would have required Congress to
pay for the $13.1 billion bill by cutting funds from other
government programs. Supporters said the government should not raid
the projected Social Security surplus to pay for the measure.
Opponents said offsetting the costs would defeat the purpose of an
emergency spending bill, which does not have to abide by spending
caps, according to budget rules. A ``yes'' vote favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: LESS FUNDS
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday rejected, 164-260, an amendment to the
Kosovo emergency spending bill that would have pared down the cost
from $13.1 billion to $11.7 billion. Supporters said the original
bill was too loaded down with non-emergency spending measures.
Opponents said the military needs the full $13.1 billion to carry
out the mission in Kosovo. A ``yes'' vote favors the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: GROUND
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday rejected, 117-301, an amendment to the
Kosovo emergency spending bill that would have prevented President
Clinton from using the $13.1 billion for ground troops unless he
first sought congressional authorization. Supporters said Clinton
needs to involve Congress when making decisions regarding the
troops in Kosovo. Opponents said the amendment was inappropriate
and could cause a presidential veto. A ``yes'' vote favors the
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   5) BILL NUMBER: FUNDING
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 311-105, a $13.1 billion
emergency spending bill that will fund the conflict in Kosovo
through September. The final amount more than doubles President
Clinton's initial funding request of $6.05 billion. Supporters said
Congress should send the troops in the Balkans whatever resources
they need to safely carry out their mission, even if members do not
agree with Clinton's handling of the conflict. Opponents said the
bill is too loaded down with non-emergency spending requests, such
as military construction projects and pay raises, and will further
sap the Social Security fund. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. _ If there's one thing that the thousands of
pilgrims who made their way here last weekend would be loath to say
about Warren Buffett, it's that he's shameless.
</P>
<P>
   But it's true. No other American chief executive may be so
plain-spoken or so masterful an investor. Nor does any other
American chief executive do so many hokey things.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the annual, three-day gathering of investors in
his company, Berkshire Hathaway _ a get-together that he has called
the capitalists' Woodstock _ Buffett could be seen all over town.
He donned an old-time baseball uniform to throw out the first pitch
at a minor league game, to Hall of Famer Ernie Banks. ( Buffett's
number: 1/16, in homage to Wall Street and its stock fractions.)
</P>
<P>
   He also signed autographs outside Gorat's, his favorite
steakhouse. He played bridge, ``the official game of Berkshire
Hathaway,'' at a local mall _ against a former world champion.
</P>
<P>
   And during Berkshire's six-hour annual meeting here in Berkshire
Hathaway's hometown last Monday, a session generally regarded as
one of the best financial seminars conducted anywhere each year,
Buffett ritualistically swigged Cherry Cokes and nibbled at See's
candies and Dairy Queen ice cream bars _ all products of Berkshire
holdings, all demonstrations of his penchant for concrete
investments in things you can use every day.
</P>
<P>
   Hucksterism? Of course. Buffett, 68, a kind of Will Rogers
character with John D. Rockefeller's bank account, has mastered the
art. But Berkshire Hathaway shareholders don't care. Like
teen-agers at a marathon rock concert _ or, perhaps, religious
devotees at a revival meeting _ some 15,000 of them came here to
soak up his every word and gesture.
</P>
<P>
   They waited in long lines wherever he went, simply to get their
hero's signature on old photographs, annual reports he had written,
ticket stubs, baseball caps, dollar bills or books. They shopped at
Borsheim's jewelry store and the Nebraska Furniture Mart, Omaha
businesses he bought for Berkshire because he thought their owners
were brilliant merchants; they drove by the modest house that
Buffett bought for $32,000 in 1958 and still calls home.
</P>
<P>
   One visitor said he'd rather be in Omaha than at the Super Bowl.
Another shareholder, Laurence Day of St. Louis, said he told his
wife he preferred Omaha to Paris this time of year. And Richard
Dejonckheere, a sports trainer from Belgium, remarked: ``Like every
good Moslem goes to Mecca, I come here. Every shareholder or
capitalist should go one time to Omaha.''
</P>
<P>
   It is like this here every spring around the first Monday in May
_ even in years, including this one, when Berkshire Hathaway stock
is lagging behind the broader market and the investing world has
been agog over technology companies instead of Buffett's favored
consumer brands. After more than 30 years of whipping the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, his followers happily make allowances for
Buffett's minor miscues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried,'' said Frank Booker, an investor who came
from St. Simons Island, Ga. ``We've been through this before. And I
don't know anyone else I'd rather have as the captain of my
capital.''
</P>
<P>
   Partly, maybe mostly, such affection is fueled by the love of
money. The faithful know that Buffett's investing catechism has
generated astonishing returns. They can cite the figures by heart:
a $10,000 investment in Berkshire in 1965 would be worth about $65
million today. Though the class A shares are up less than 10
percent this year, about half as much as the Dow Jones industrials,
this follows a 50 percent increase for the shares in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But more is at work here. The pilgrims flock to Omaha because
the huckster seems so sincere.
</P>
<P>
   With his focus on the long term and his antipathy for the
trendy, Buffett may be out of step with Wall Street and much of
corporate America, they say. But he represents something they find
wholesome, true and uniquely American. By all accounts he lives
simply, well below his means and with few of the trappings of
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   And in a marketplace crowded with whispering insiders,
accountants' obfuscations and boosters happy to promote stocks at
almost any price, he speaks directly to his shareholders, in
language they can understand and with the kind of wit and wisdom
they can appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   In short, shareholders say they come each year because Buffett
and Berkshire embody not just value investing but values. Study
hard, he says. Search out sound advice. Know your limitations. And
ask the right questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a philosophy of investing and a philosophy of life,''
said Jeffrey Crohn, who came here from Mount Kisco, N.Y., for the
Berkshire meeting with his wife, Kathleen, and left with a new
bedroom set, television cabinet and patio furniture from the
Nebraska Furniture Mart.
</P>
<P>
   The Crohns, who say they have seven shares of Berkshire's class
B stock _ the version that now sells for about $2,500 a share,
versus the $77,000 price tag that keeps the original class A shares
beyond the reach of most investors _ are now passing on those
lessons to their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buffett takes a very common-sense approach to life,'' Crohn
said. ``You achieve what you achieve through hard work and sound
management.''
</P>
<P>
   There are moments during the Berkshire weekend when the Warren
worship seems to get out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When Buffett stopped at Borsheim's, which was opened on Sunday
just for shareholders, the store was mobbed, with shoppers spilling
into the common area of the Regency Mall. Eager to record the
moment, one woman yelled, ``Honey, hurry up and take the picture!''
as Buffett passed through. Later that evening, when he downed his
trademark T-bone steak with a double order of hash browns at a
shareholders' dinner at Gorat's, 200 others, lemming-like, ordered
the identical meal, the manager said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the news media grew idolatrous. During a two-hour news
conference in which Buffett and Berkshire's vice chairman, Charles
T. Munger, waxed poetic about investing, one reporter interrupted
to say: ``Buffett, I want to go to a warm and fuzzy place. I'm very
taken with the fact that your shareholders are very taken with
you.'' As the session ended, the gathered reporters broke,
uncharacteristically, into applause.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after, Marc Norton of The Louisville Courier-Journal,
who had posed a serious question during the news conference, nabbed
Buffett in the parking lot and asked him to pose for a picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, I'll whisper a stock tip in your ear,'' Buffett said,
and he jokingly pretended to do so just as the picture was snapped.
``What did he say?'' another reporter begged to know as Buffett
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett has taken note of the frenzied rise of his profile.
``There's no question the celebrity aspect has gotten played up,''
he told the reporters. ``But Berkshire shareholders know what they
own.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the little companies he hawks so unabashedly, they own a
huge insurance business, made up largely of Geico, which sells auto
and other insurance directly to consumers, and General Re, a
reinsurer that Buffett bought last year. And they share in
Berkshire's storied portfolio of stocks: By investing in companies
with rich consumer franchises like Coca-Cola, Gillette, Walt
Disney, Washington Post and American Express, Buffett has made
Berkshire _ a small company of which he gained control in 1965 _
into a company now worth $116 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a unique person in the history of capitalism,'' said
Stevin R. Hoover, a money manager from Boston who has been a
Berkshire shareholder since 1982 and was on his 10th trip to Omaha.
``He's made most of us a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffett's style of value investing, however, is largely out of
fashion these days. And that has made Omaha _ and the figurative
Omaha that exists wherever Berkshire shareholders reside _ a
peculiar outpost in a financial world enamored of momentum trading,
the latest hot new offering and Internet stocks valued at multiples
of their losses, not their earnings.
</P>
<P>
   But Buffett remains the world's second-richest man _ after only
his friend William Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft _ and is the
architect of countless Berkshire fortunes. In fact, many people
travel to Omaha simply to thank him for setting them on the road to
riches _ riches that they also tend not to flaunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're millionaires, but who would know?'' said Ernest Arvesen,
61, a retired banker from Atlanta. ``Not our neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Not, that is, unless they looked in the closets and medicine
cabinets of Buffett's devotees.
</P>
<P>
   Day, the St. Louis investor, had his epiphany in 1982, when he
was sitting on a beach in northern Michigan with a pile of
Berkshire Hathaway annual reports. ``I read them and I was totally
absorbed,'' he recalled. ``I said, My God, this is it.'' Now Day,
65, arranges his everyday life around Buffett's favorite stocks,
living by the theory that the investor's sidekick, Munger, likes to
call ``eating your own cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I buy every one of Berkshire's products,'' Day said.
``Gillette razors. Coke. And now I have Geico insurance.'' He
recently was married _ and naturally, his wedding ring was bought
at Borsheim's.
</P>
<P>
   Most shareholders, however, say they come to Omaha not to buy
Berkshire goods but to listen to Buffett's lengthy
question-and-answer session at the annual meeting _ the formal
raison d'etre for the weekend hoopla.
</P>
<P>
   This year, they lined up as early as 4:30 a.m. outside the
Aksarben (that's Nebraska, spelled backwards) Auditorium, which
seats 14,000. And when the doors opened two and a half hours later,
Buffett was there to greet those who rushed through the turnstiles.
</P>
<P>
   The billionaire then hopped into his Lincoln Town Car and drove
out through the parking lot, waving to a long line of shareholders
waiting to enter the arena.
</P>
<P>
   When everyone was in place, Buffett and Munger entered the
packed auditorium to a standing ovation, in what shareholders
describe as a kind of parting of the waters as the two made their
way toward the stage.
</P>
<P>
   The two men quickly ran through the official business of the
company. And then _ when most annual meetings would abruptly be
adjourned _ they opened the floor to questions, which they answered
patiently, often with a good deal of wit, until 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   (Actually, Buffett answered most of the questions, with
occasional philosophical musings from the generally silent,
seemingly lifeless Munger, whom Buffett introduced this way: ``If
you haven't figured it out, this hyperkinetic bundle of energy on
my left is Charlie Munger.'')
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The shareholders asked about everything _ Buffett's investment
philosophy, of course, and what the company would look like after
his death. (He has already named successors, he said _ without
naming names _ and ``they'd be ready to take over tomorrow.'')
</P>
<P>
   They asked the personal, too. Was he interested in a career in
music? (No, though he sang ``Tomorrow'' at a benefit performance of
the musical ``Annie'' last year.)
</P>
<P>
   What books would he recommend? ``Personal History'' (Knopf,
1997), the autobiography of Katharine Graham, the former publisher
of The Washington Post, and ``Common Sense on Mutual Funds''
(Wiley, 1999), by John C. Bogle, senior chairman and founder of the
Vanguard Group.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders also posed pointed queries about specific investing
decisions, including why Buffett chose to sell a large number of
shares in McDonald's last year _ shares that later skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mistake,'' he said, repeating what he told
shareholders in this year's annual report: ``Over all, you would
have been better off last year if I had regularly snuck off to the
movies during market hours.''
</P>
<P>
   And they asked about the prospects for core Berkshire holdings
like Coca-Cola, Gillette and Disney, whose chief executive, Michael
D. Eisner, took a break on Monday from the ugly trial over his feud
with a former company executive to visit the Main Street U.S.A. of
Buffett's annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   All those stocks have badly trailed the market lately, but
Buffett gave no hint of souring on any of them. About Coca-Cola, in
which Berkshire had an 8 percent stake at the end of last year, he
said, ``Through the next 20 years, preference for Coke will do
nothing but grow.''
</P>
<P>
   He steered away from stock recommendations or predications,
however, though shareholders repeatedly encouraged a leak. Despite
his occasional big bet on macroeconomic trends _ he bought 111
million ounces of silver in 1997, for example, expecting the price
to soar with growing demand _ he declined to forecast interest
rates or discuss the big economic picture. Buffett may sometimes
seem like a hayseed, but he is not about to show other market
players his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, Buffett said that he doesn't pay attention to
the everyday swings in the market: ``We don't worry about the
performance of the stock; we worry about the performance of the
company.'' True to his habit of talking down Berkshire's prospects,
he acknowledged difficulty in finding good values in a highly
valued market, and the near impossibility of keeping a $100 billion
company's value growing at 20 percent or more a year, as his
investors have come to expect.
</P>
<P>
   Some shareholders, nervously challenging their guru, asked why
he didn't embrace the technology stocks that so many other
investors look to for growth. Buffett said that while the
technology revolution has changed the economic landscape, he
doesn't know how to evaluate the long-term prospects of such stocks
_ and that the values assigned many of them by the market indicate
that other investors don't, either.
</P>
<P>
   Taking bites from a Dairy Queen ice cream bar, Buffett said he
simply buys what he knows, then offered a judgment he has no doubt
debated over many bridge games with his friend Gates. ``The Dilly
Bar,'' he said with a smile, ``is more certain to be around in 10
years than any single software application.''

 &HT;    Hamvention brings thousands to Ohio
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Dick Miller, general chairman for this year's
Hamvention, wants the event to be a success _ but not too much of a
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're expecting 25,000 to 28,000 people, and if we get about
25,000 I'll be tickled pink,'' Miller said. ``When you get 28,000
and above it really starts getting crowded.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamvention, which is in its 48th year, is the annual gathering
of amateur radio enthusiasts from all over the world. Participants
will gather at the Dayton Hara Complex Friday through May 16 to
check out the latest in radio and other electronic equipment and to
meet people with whom they've communicated by radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We refer to it as `eyeball contact,''' Miller said. ``Last
year a guy from Australia recognized my call letters from my
license plates and introduced himself. That sort of thing is an
important part of Hamvention.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said about 1,500 vendors will set up sales displays of
hard-to-find parts and equipment in the flea-market area in Hara's
back parking lot. Another 250 manufacturers and vendors maintain
booths inside the arena's buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Hamvention also features forums and seminars in Hara's meeting
rooms. ``We take up every square foot of available public space
there,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   For participants who don't want to spend all their time in
Dayton twiddling knobs and raising antennae, Hamvention offers a
series of alternative activities next Saturday. Miller said those
activities, organized with the help of the Dayton/Montgomery County
Convention and Visitors Bureau, include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Cooking classes: Starting at 8:45 a.m. at Sinclair Community
College, a local chef will share recipes and food preparation tips.
Participants will prepare a lunch. The fee is $20, and admission to
this and all other alternative activities is open to people holding
Hamvention tickets only.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shop Around: A bus tour of local boutiques and specialty shops
starts at 9 a.m. and runs until midafternoon. Admission is $5.
</P>
<P>
   _ How Does Your Garden Grow? A gardening class held at
Meadowdale High School from 10 to 11:15 a.m. Saturday. The fee is
$3.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dine Around: A bus will pick up guests at Hara on at 10:45
a.m. Saturday and take them to the Bravo Italian Kitchen, L'Auberge
and El Meson Restaurant. Admission is $17 per person.
</P>
<P>
   _ City Tour: A bus tour leaves Hara at 1 p.m. and returns at 4
p.m. after showing the sights of the city. Admission is $7.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make It, Take It: A craft class in which participants will
keep the craft items they produce will be held at Meadowdale High
School from 1:30 to 2:30 p.m. The fee is $5.
</P>
<P>
   _ Let's Get Beautiful: The event, which carries a $5 fee,
features tips and demonstrations on nails, lip colors, fragrances
and color matching. It will be held at Meadowdale High School from
3 to 4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   _ Banquet and Concert: A banquet will be held at the Nutter
Center at 7 p.m. Saturday, and a concert featuring Joe Walsh,
formerly of the Eagles, will be held later in the evening.
Admission to the banquet and show is $40 a person. Admission to the
concert only is $20, and tickets are available at the Hara and
Nutter box offices as well as through Ticketmaster.

   Patching an Appeal For Charity Donations &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In recent advertisements for the Weatherproof Garment Co.,
consumers are urged to support something called the Weatherproof
American Red Cross Storm Fund. The American Red Cross logo (the
little red cross) also appears in the ads.
</P>
<P>
   One snag: There is no such fund. Well, not really. Weatherproof
Garment, the New York apparel company, said it wanted to do
something to benefit the charity (and help sell more of its
outerwear), but it has not collected any money since the ads began
running last year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the company said it simply refers any inquiries to the
Red Cross' general toll-free number. Weatherproof also said it has
already donated 1,400 coats and jackets to the Red Cross and plans
to donate 5,000 to 10,000 T-shirts, sweatshirts and other garments
before June, according to Joyce Silverman, the director of
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   To clear up any confusion, Weatherproof is changing the ads to
feature the toll-free number for the American Red Cross Disaster
Relief Fund (which does exist) and will forward any donations sent
in care of the company. And it plans to talk soon with charity
officials to work out the details of any future efforts. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: LEON HESS DESERVED MORE THRILLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the New York Jets were about to go to Denver for last
season's American Football Conference championship game, Leon Hess
was asked if he would make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said. ``I have a little problem.''
</P>
<P>
   His little problem was a blood disease that required periodic
transfusions. But when the Jets, after losing in that opportunity
to go to the Super Bowl, returned and filed out of their chartered
airliner at La Guardia Airport around 2 o'clock the next morning,
Leon Hess was at the gate to greet all the coaches and players.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that night's freezing cold,'' Jets president Steve Gutman
recalled, ``Leon came out to shake hands with everybody and thank
them for the season.''
</P>
<P>
   With a 13-5 record, it was the Jets' best season in their more
than two decades with Leon Hess as the principal owner. And his
last season. He died early Friday at Lenox Hill Hospital in
Manhattan, at age 85, of what he had called his little problem.
Typical.
</P>
<P>
   As the chairman of Amerada Hess Corp., he was worth $720
million, according to Forbes magazine last October, but he never
flashed his money clip or his ego. One year, when the Jets'
public-relations staff couldn't find a photo of him, he chuckled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good,'' he said, ``You won't be able to put my picture in the
media guide.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his wealth, Hess lived quietly, privately. After a
National Football League meeting one year, he discovered that he
was to ride to the airport in a white Rolls-Royce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not me,'' he said. ``I'm not riding in a white Rolls-Royce.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a dark sedan was all Leon Hess needed. No glitz, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   After a Jets game, win or lose, he would stop by the lockers of
a few older players to talk, then he would sit in the coach's
office for maybe half an hour, mostly listening or consoling, then
quietly depart through the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Any time an injured Jets player had to stay overnight at Lenox
Hill, Hess always visited. When Dennis Byrd was partly paralyzed in
1992, Hess visited the defensive end nightly for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Hess was cherished by the Jets' coaches, players and office
employees, but as the team struggled through so many disappointing
seasons, their frustrated fans mistook his introverted manner for
indifference. Many hoped he would sell the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jets haven't been worth the aggravation,'' he once
acknowledged, ``but I'd be damned if I'd quit. I'll never sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Jets made the playoffs in the 1969, 1981, 1982,
1985, 1986 and 1991 seasons, they never returned to the Super Bowl
that the 1968 team had won when Hess was a part owner. As the
principal owner, Hess had approved the hiring of Walt Michaels, Joe
Walton, Bruce Coslet and Pete Carroll as coaches. Then, he hired
Rich Kotite himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of those coaches were in over their head; I probably
kept them two or three years longer than I should have,'' he said
late last season. ``I had the idea the team could be run by
committee, but it's like a business. You need a strong man.''
</P>
<P>
   When that strong man, Bill Parcells, was available in 1997 after
having resigned as the New England Patriots' coach, Hess pursued
him, only to discover that he had to negotiate compensation with
Patriots owner Robert Kraft and NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   As an oil baron, Hess once sat with Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi's negotiator, who put a revolver on the table. Another time
he went to see the Shah of Iran in a car with soldiers' guns
sticking out its windows. Each time, he got the oil contract he
wanted. So the negotiations with Kraft weren't about to intimidate
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kraft put his offer down on one side of a piece of paper, we
put down our offer on the other side,'' Hess later recalled. ``Then
I suggested that we give our offers to the commissioner and accept
his decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue decreed that the Jets give the Patriots four early
draft choices over the next three years. Hess acknowledged that
Kraft ``got more out of us than we wanted to give, but he got less
than he wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   More important, Hess got Parcells, who last season guided the
Jets to their first divisional title since 1969.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning the division,'' Hess said then, ``is one of the
greatest thrills of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Jets' owner, it was one of Leon Hess' few thrills. He
deserved many, many more.  &QL;

THOUSANDS OF U.S.-BASED ISRAELIS TO FLY HOME TO VOTE

 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a trans-Atlantic expansion of one of America's
oldest political practices _ getting out the vote _ supporters of
the two major candidates for prime minister of Israel are arranging
for thousands of Israelis living in the United States to fly home
at cut-rate fares for the coming national elections.
</P>
<P>
   Like cars dispatched by big-city precinct captains to taxi
voters to the polls, chartered jets are scheduled to begin flying
out of New York and a few other North American cities next weekend,
timed to arrive in Tel Aviv as the polls open on May 17. The jumbo
747s are to be met by buses which, organizers say, will take the
arriving passengers, most of whom hold dual Israeli and American
citizenships, directly from the 12-hour flight to the polling
stations in the Israeli communities they call home.
</P>
<P>
   The get-out-the-vote campaign marks a dramatic expansion of a
much more modest effort that was organized in 1996, mostly by
religious Jews in Brooklyn who flew to Israel to vote for Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his Likud Party. By contrast, this
time there are two New York-based groups that, with the backing of
wealthy American benefactors who have taken an interest in the
election, are offering round-trip fares ranging from $180 to $449,
much less than the standard coach class round-trip fare of about
$1,000.
</P>
<P>
   They estimate that between them, they will ferry as many as
15,000 Israelis back home for the vote and a possible runoff in
June _ a number that could prove to be a major factor if the
election turns out to be anywhere near as close as the last one, in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   For a variety of legal reasons, the two organizations, Chai
L'Yisrael and Kesher, are presenting themselves as nonpartisan,
interested only in insuring that Israelis living in America have an
opportunity to participate in the election. In fact, though, each
organization has a clear allegiance to one of the two major
candidates _ Chai L'Yisrael has ties to Netanyahu, while Kesher is
seen as favoring Ehad Barak of the Labor Party _ and has sought to
market the discounted seats to Israelis who they presume will share
their sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   The flights, which have been advertised in Israeli newspapers
distributed in the United States, on a Web site and in Hebrew- and
English-language fliers posted in Jewish neighborhoods in Brooklyn
and Queens, are the latest evidence of American influence on
Israeli politics. This campaign for prime minister has already been
distinguished by the reliance of both Netanyahu and Barak on
American political consultants to help run their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to fly voters to the polls also suggests the depth of
the ties that Jews who have moved to United States maintain with
the country they call their homeland, as well as the intensity that
Israelis _ no matter where they live _ bring to their politics.
Turnout in Israeli elections is typically more than 80 percent of
the voting-age population, and a number of Israelis living in
America said this week that they thought nothing about flying 12
hours to cast a vote in what could be a very close election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a very important election,'' said Tami
Giniger, a 22-year-old New York University student who is booked on
a Kesher flight and is planning is planning to vote for Barak.
</P>
<P>
   But the flights have caused clear concern in Israel. Although
Israel bans foreign contributions to its political campaigns, the
subsidized flights allow wealthy Americans, who as a rule have not
identified themselves publicly, to affect the outcome of the
Israeli election in a much more direct way than just contributing
money to a candidate. And the image of thousands of Israelis who
live in America jetting in, voting and then leaving a week or so
later, after a short vacation, has drawn the attention of the
Israeli press and clearly rankled some Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who don't live here, who don't bear the
consequence of their vote,'' said Alon Pinkas, a political
consultant who is advising Barak.
</P>
<P>
   On a practical level, many Labor leaders are concerned that the
influx will encourage voter fraud that may play to the advantage of
Netanyahu. At polling places, Israelis are required to display
identity cards that include their photographs. But Barak's
supporters say that many of the returning Americans are Hasidim
who, with their beards and black hats, can be difficult to
distinguish from one another.
</P>
<P>
   That raises the possibility, these supporters say, that those
voters will fly in with a stack of their friends' identity cards
and employ another old American political practice: voting early
and often, and most likely _ given their conservatism _ for
Netanyahu and the Likud slate of candidates for the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that has stuck in the side of the left for a
long time,'' said Steve Rabinowitz, a Washington political
consultant who is advising Barak. ``These are the guys who have
historically been believed to be flooding back to Israel for the
election _ and if not them, at least their identity card.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no way to verify claims by the two New York groups that
they will fly 15,000 Israelis back home for the May 17 election and
the June 2 runoff that will take place if neither Netanyahu nor
Barak wins more than 50 percent, as now appears likely in a crowded
field.
</P>
<P>
   But even accounting for exaggeration _ another political
practice that crosses international boundaries _ it is now fairly
certain that the Israeli electorate this year will include a
sizable number of dual citizens who live and work in the United
States but are able to vote in Israel because of Israeli
immigration laws intended to encourage Jews dispersed across the
world to establish residency there.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And considering that Netanyahu defeated Shimon Peres in 1996 by
only 29,457 votes out of about 3 million cast, the
American-generated turnout could prove consequential if the vote is
close again. Recent polls show the contest is close, with Barak
pulling ahead in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big influence in a very close, very tight race,'' said
Udi Behr, 38, a jewelry designer from Manhattan, who organized the
Kesher effort.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of the interest stirred in New York by the prospect of
going home for the Israeli elections could be found in a recent
visit to the bustling offices of Chai L'Yisrael. The group is
working out of donated second-floor space overlooking 13th Avenue
in Borough Park, Brooklyn, in what is normally the political club
of state Assemblyman Dov Hikind, a Democrat and one of Netanyahu's
most prominent American supporters. Volunteers, many of them
speaking in Hebrew, worked nearly a dozen telephones to inform
people of their flight departure times.
</P>
<P>
   While both sides say they have not employed direct or indirect
measures to filter out potential customers who might not share
their political views, Chai L'Yisrael and Kesher are clearly
employing subtle means to steer their seats to sympathetic voters.
Chai L'Yisrael, for example, has advertised in The Jewish Press, a
conservative newspaper; distributed leaflets in New York
neighborhoods known as enclaves for the religious Jews who are more
likely to support Netanyahu, and set up its headquarters in the
heart of one of the city's most religious and conservative
neighborhoods, Borough Park. And the language of the leaflets
echoes almost exactly the campaign rhetoric that Netanyahu used in
1996: ``Help keep Israel Jewish and secure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I want to see Bibi Netanyahu elected,'' Hikind said. ``I
am 100 percent for him. But that is not a question that is asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Kesher has been advertising on the Internet, and has made a
particular effort to recruit Israeli students, who as a rule tend
to be liberal. And while Chai L'Yisrael is chartering jets for the
May 17 election, Kesher is holding off for the expected June 2
runoff between Barak and Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   An influx of support for Barak might prove valuable then because
some of the voters who back Barak on May 17 _ in particular, Arabs
who are drawn to the first round because it will include choosing a
Knesset _ may find little reason to show up for a runoff for prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two groups here, Chai L'Yisrael is the more heavily
subsidized, as shown by its low ticket prices _ $180 _ and its
hopes to charter as many as 20 747s. By contrast, Kesher is buying
seats in bulk on El Al and then subsidizing the discounted tickets
so they cost just over $449, plus tax.

   Those sentiments come through clearly in the latest survey of
institutional investors commissioned by Russell Reynolds
Associates, an executive search firm. The study, scheduled to be
released Monday, found that investors in Germany and Japan want
companies in those countries to be as open and forthcoming about
the way boards operate and directors are chosen as American and
British companies are. They favor establishment of international
standards for corporate governance practices, and they believe
companies everywhere should follow the British-American model of
placing shareholder value above the interests of other
``stakeholders'' like employees and suppliers, or considerations,
like the health of the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Those sentiments are not just an idle wish list; they help drive
investment decisions. About half the investors surveyed in Japan
and the United States and significant minorities in Britain and
Germany said corporate governance issues were very important or
extremely important factors in investment decisions; even larger
numbers cited adequacy of disclosure as a very important or
extremely important factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good corporate governance practices are becoming a key way for
companies to distinguish themselves when they are trying to attract
capital,'' said John Hawkins, managing director of Russell
Reynolds' board. ``It's analogous to the steps some companies have
taken to bring their accounting standards into line with Western
methods.''
</P>
<P>
   By wide majorities, the investors said good corporate governance
is essential whether or not a company is performing well and that
strong returns do not excuse opaque policies and practices.
</P>
<P>
   German and Japanese investors were included in the survey for
the first time this year, in part because companies in their
countries have structures very different from the British-American
model. For example, under German law, corporations generally have
two boards, a management board that directly runs the company and a
supervisory board on which employees are heavily represented. In
Japan, most corporations stock their boards with dozens of company
insiders, and independent outside directors are rare. For their
part, institutional investors in the two countries have much more
in common with their American and British counterparts in their
views on governance, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   One issue on which they differ is the role of credit rating
agencies: Japanese and German investors were much more likely than
Americans or Britons to want credit agencies to include corporate
governance practices in their rating reports. Hawkins speculated
that the finding could be attributed to the tendency of companies
in Germany and Japan to depend more heavily on capital raised
through borrowing and less on equity.
</P>
<P>
   British investors gave the most scrutiny to company leadership,
citing the quality of chief executives and board members as
important factors in investment decisions much more often than
their peers in the United States, Japan or Germany. A series of
high-profile commissions on corporate governance has kept the issue
in the news there in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins said that it is difficult to isolate any direct link
between governance practices and corporate performance _ ``there
are too many other, stronger variables'' _ but that most
institutional investors believe that good boardroom practices make
a difference at the margin and will loom large if markets turn
sour. ``Clearly, in a down cycle a shareholder-oriented board will
be an important protection for investors, especially minority
investors,'' Hawkins said.

TIPPER GORE DISCLOSES TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION IN 1989  
(DW) 

</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tipper Gore, the wife of the vice president,
disclosed in a newspaper article published Friday that she was
treated for depression after their 6-year-old son was severely
injured in an automobile accident in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In the article, published by USA Today in a question-and-answer
format, Mrs. Gore said she had taken medication and received
counseling for the depression and was not now under treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Her office confirmed the details of the published account but
said she would not be available to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore has long been an advocate of efforts to combat mental
illness. She said in the interview that she hoped her story would
encourage others to seek treatment and that her husband's campaign
for president was ``not really'' a factor in the timing of her
public account. But it is nonetheless clear that her making her
illness known now pre-empted the possibility of a potentially
damaging disclosure about it later, in the heat of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely a clinical depression and one that I was
going to have to have help to overcome,'' Mrs. Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling her counseling from a social worker, she added, ``You
just can't will your way out of that or pray your way out of that
or pull yourself up by the bootstraps out of that _ you really have
to go and get help, and I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore, whose son, Albert Gore III, recovered from the
accident, did not disclose many details about her depression. She
did not say how long it had lasted, and she declined to say which
medication she had taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that when someone singles out a particular
medication,'' she said, ``then someone's reading about it saying,
`I'm going to try that' or `Other things don't work as well.' It's
not a one-size-fits-all kind of answer.''
</P>
<P>
   This is hardly the first time that the spouse of a political
candidate has been led to disclose a personal problem, and on her
own terms. One memorable instance occurred in July 1987, several
months after Michael S. Dukakis began running for president, when
his wife, Kitty, said she had been dependent on amphetamines for 26
years and had been treated for addiction in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   As for Mrs. Gore, she said that in her travels she had
encountered many young people suffering from depression and thought
her disclosure might be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``extremely frightening,'' she said, to realize that she
needed professional help, but ``I do consider that I have
recovered.''

 &HT;    Researchers probe how to be heart smart about feelings
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ When Rollin McCraty says the heart has its own
brain, he's not suggesting the left ventricle can calculate long
division, conjugate verbs or identify colors.
</P>
<P>
   Those conscious decisions are made in the gray matter within the
skull. It's the unconscious emotions that are processed in the more
than 40,000 neurons of the heart.
</P>
<P>
   So when a car cuts us off on the highway, it is the brain that
quickly converts the sight into instructions to hit the brakes or
change lanes. And just as quickly, the heart converts the same
sight into the tense and testy feelings we associate with fear and
anger.
</P>
<P>
   Once we understand the heart's physical relationship to
emotions, we can use that relationship ``to help manage emotions,''
says McCraty, research director and institute co-founder of the
Institute of HeartMath near San Jose, Calif. With his co-founders,
he has developed techniques for changing the messages the heart
sends through its own nervous system to the rest of the body,
creating the highs of love and compassion or the unpleasant
physical and mental effects of fear, anger and other stressful
emotions.
</P>
<P>
   The approach takes advantage of growing evidence that emotions
can affect thoughts instead of only the other way around, as has
been traditionally believed. HeartMath researchers, lacking medical
backgrounds and challenging mainstream philosophies, have raised
some eyebrows and voices among critics, but also have been
published in The American Journal of Cardiology and have assembled
an international advisory board of doctors in various specialties.
</P>
<P>
   Their techniques are the cornerstone of The HeartMath Solution
(HarperCollins, $24). It was written by co-founders Doc Childre and
Howard Martin with Donna Beech.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between emotional states and heart physiology
traces its roots to Yellow Springs, where John and Beatrice Lacey
studied it through the 1960s at the Fels Research Institute, now
part of the Wright State University School of Medicine, with a
focus on changes in body shapes.
</P>
<P>
   They called the heart's communication pathways to the brain
``the key to the understanding'' of what is now called the
mind-body connection, and advocated the cardiovascular system as an
important area of psychiatric study.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Laceys are legends now,'' McCraty says, and their research
is still valuable more than 30 years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's relatively new,'' he says, ``is how complex the nervous
system in the heart is, and that it can and does function
independently of the central nervous system. It can beat on its own
without any connection to the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Heart rates are always changing in a healthy heart, McCraty
says. When we experience pleasant emotions such as appreciation,
those changes are consistently rhythmic enough to dance to,
yielding a graph of smooth peaks and valleys. But during
frustration or insecurity, the graph is erratic and jagged, a
pattern that interferes with the heart's messages to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't think as clearly,'' McCraty says. ``Which is one
reason when we get angry, we tend to say things we later regret.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a fine response to prehistoric stresses that were
pretty much limited to large, hungry animals, devastating weather
or other humans with spears. That reaction of the brain to
emotional stressors is the fight-or-flight response, named for the
only prehistoric options to danger. It accelerates the heart,
breath and hormonal rates that are needed for strength and speed,
and it shuts down everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting and fleeing don't apply well to the modern stressors of
rude retailers, unreasonable bosses, crying children and empty
checkbooks. That is why we have stress-management programs,
although McCraty says they still aren't prevalent in corporate
cultures that generate the most stress.
</P>
<P>
   The programs available for managing stress typically feature
either meditation or exercise, he says. Both approaches are aimed
at the brain's fight-or-flight response, raising the threshold
before it becomes disruptive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're helpful, but they really don't get at the source of
the stress,'' McCraty says. That source begins with ``how we're
perceiving the events in our life,'' and proceeds to which emotions
the perceptions trigger and which heart patterns the emotions
trigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to ultimately shift our perceptions,'' he says. ``The
same events are going to happen. We're not going to stop the
traffic jams. But we can modify how we're perceiving them.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the HeartMath techniques, called Freeze-Frame, can be
used ``in the middle of a staff meeting or while you're talking to
someone on the phone,'' McCraty says. While meditation works at
preventing emotions from going out of control under stress, the
HeartMath team wanted to develop easy techniques that could be used
in the moment of stress _ more of a drive-through solution for a
drive-through world.
</P>
<P>
   Freeze-Frame begins with recognizing the stress and shifting the
focus away from the problem, toward the heart for at least 10
seconds. Then recall a happy moment _ of friendship, recognition or
enjoyable activity, for example _ and try to experience it again.
The idea is to learn how to create feelings of love or appreciation
that override the jagged heart rhythms of instinctive frustration
or anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heart has a type of intelligence that's not cognitive,''
McCraty says, ``but more on the feeling level, more intuitive. It's
part of why we feel our emotions in the heart. That's been
recognized in folklore for centuries, but not in science until the
modern recognition that the heart is one of the key points in our
emotional system.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO forces pounding the center of Yugoslavia's
capital apparently struck China's Embassy in Belgrade Friday night,
only hours after knocking out electrical power across much of the
country. Yugoslav authorities immediately reported numerous
injuries, both inside and outside the embassy, but none of them
serious.
</P>
<P>
   Only moments before reports of the strike on the embassy, which
was hit just before midnight in Belgrade, NATO officials
acknowledged that cluster bombs dropped from an F-16 fighter jet
had caused extensive damage to a hospital complex and marketplace
in Nis, Yugoslavia's third largest city. Belgrade said 15 people
died in that attack.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials, who escorted journalists to the scene,
reported that an additional 60 were wounded. Dismembered bodies lay
on a street nearby around yellow casings from the cluster bombs,
which upon detonating cover a target with smaller bomblets.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy, in the new section of the capital west of the Sava
River, is near the headquarters of a television station owned by a
close associate of Milosevic. Smoke and flames poured from
blown-out windows of the two-story embassy building, which was
fully evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   A Yugoslav official said 26 people were in the building when it
was hit, and some were taken to hospitals but none with serious
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The damage to the embassy is certain to add still more tumult to
already strained relationship with NATO and the United States for
China, which has been sharply critical of NATO's air war. On
Thursday, China's foreign ministry called on NATO to halt the
bombing, saying it had caused ``great civilian casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   As a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, China has
veto power over any settlement of the conflict that would have the
international body's imprimatur.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing we can say at this point,'' the Pentagon's
spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The White House immediately reached out to China's embassy here
in Washington to inform its diplomats of the strike, an
administration official said. NATO and Pentagon officials were
scrambling for information that could explain whether one of its
missiles or bombs was involved. The strike occurred during a
powerful series of explosions from NATO bombs that rocked the
capital through the evening.
</P>
<P>
   After nightfall, allied warplanes attacked four electrical
transformers in and around Belgrade, once again darkening the
capital and much of the rest of the country. The raids reportedly
struck several government and military buildings in Belgrade's
center, as well as the city's main power plant.
</P>
<P>
   The barrage in Belgrade followed a three-day lull in strikes
against the capital that coincided with diplomatic efforts to end
NATO's air campaign against Yugoslavia, even though NATO officials
insisted there was no correlation.
</P>
<P>
   Even as diplomats from Washington to Moscow shuttled from
capital to capital carrying the outlines of a settlement, the
United States and NATO vowed to keep intensifying the attacks,
which continued for a 45th day.
</P>
<P>
   A consequence of NATO's intensified assault has been growing
numbers of misfires and civilian deaths, which the alliance has
repeatedly said it hoped to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and Pentagon officials reported a large attack by allied
warplanes against the airfield in Nis, as well as a radio tower,
but at least one bomb fell short of its targets, for reasons that
were still not clear, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, it is highly probable that a weapon went astray
and hit civilian buildings,'' a statement released late Friday at
NATO's headquarters in Brussels said. ``There was no intent to harm
civilians during this strike.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, NATO has emphasized that civilian deaths were
always a possibility in warfare, despite the technological
precision of its laser- and satellite-guided weapons. But NATO has
found itself on the defensive after several incidents resulted in
dozens of deaths _ from the bombing of a train crossing the Juzna
Morava River in mid-April to the destruction of a neighborhood in
Surdulica last week.

HERE COMES SOME HELP FOR AGING, ROTTING LOB CABIN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONDS, Wash. _ A historic log cabin in downtown Edmonds is
deteriorating and needs repairs fast.
</P>
<P>
   Children are dropping coins into ``Save Our Cabin'' donation
boxes. The historical society has prepared a cabin slide show. The
city government is sending in log cabin experts.
</P>
<P>
   So what does all this have to do with ``Here Come the Brides,''
a minor cult-classic TV show from decades past?
</P>
<P>
   Not much, but enough that the show's fans from around the
country want to save the cabin too.
</P>
<P>
   The unlikely connection is Edmonds native Bridget Hanley, an
actress who starred in the 1960s adventure-comedy show.
</P>
<P>
   Hanley's grandparents once lived in the tiny cabin, and her
family has been active in restoration efforts. Now ``Brides'' fans
nationwide have rallied behind the cause since learning of the
connection through fan club Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just knocked out'' by the support, Hanley said by
telephone from her Los Angeles home this week. ```Here Come The
Brides,' God bless it.''
</P>
<P>
   The ABC show began in 1968 and was set in Seattle's pioneer
days. It served as a career springboard for many of its stars,
including teen heartthrob Bobby Sherman.
</P>
<P>
   Fans have set up an online ``Save Our Cabin'' store, unfazed by
the fact that the cabin itself had nothing to do with the show.
</P>
<P>
   In the brief weeks since the online store opened for business,
it's done a brisk trade in fan-donated memorabilia like a Bobby
Sherman stuffed pillow, an old issue of TV Guide featuring the show
and 8x10 glossy photographs of `Brides' stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in the fan club have felt a need to
participate and support Bridget and her family in this,'' said
Olympia supporter Wendy McAbee, who bought items off the Web site,
donated others for sale, and is helping the Edmonds committee.
</P>
<P>
   The fan efforts, while appreciated by cabin supporters, are just
a small part of the widespread local drive to save the building,
which is now owned by the city and serves as its visitors bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just charming. It's one of those places you go into and
you feel warm,'' said historical society and cabin restoration
committee member Mary Van Meter. ``It's an important part of the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   The cabin isn't particularly old as log cabins go. It was built
in the 1930s from Douglas firs cleared from the Edmonds woods and
modeled after lodges at Yellowstone National Park. It was used as a
guest house by a Edmonds business leader, then as a home by
Hanley's grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   The family later donated the cabin to the city, and it was moved
next to the historical museum for the nation's bicentennial.
</P>
<P>
   Grade-schoolers visit it for history lessons each year, running
hands along the shiny sapling banister, learning about the chinking
system that sealed the logs, and seeing how the interior is
unchanged from the black-and-white family photos on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cabin's problems came about because the bicentennial
movers placed it directly on the ground, with no foundation to
protect the logs from moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Rotting logs now need to be replaced, sound ones need to be
preserved, and a new foundation is essential, city officials said.
Early repair estimates range from $28,000 to more than $100,000,
and getting a solid figure is the next step.
</P>
<P>
   Van Meter and others are working to place the cabin on a state
historic register, which would exempt the cabin from the
modernizing features that would otherwise be required by the
building code if the building were renovated.
</P>
<P>
   The committee has raised about $7,000 for restorations to date,
with the largest contributions coming from the historical society
and the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brides'' fans plan to continue their fund-raising work, and
Hanley herself plans to come to the area for fund-raising
performances.
</P>
<P>
   Hanley said she's always loved visiting the cabin when she
returned to her hometown, and felt it was an important part of the
city's history as well as her family.
</P>
<P>
   She remembers Edmonds as a child's paradise of dirt roads and
forest and wild blackberry vines, with the cabin ``a gingerbread
house'' where she and her sisters sat and licked icicles in the
wintertime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just like being in a fairyland...'' she said. ``It was
just a charming, wonderful, warm and very gentle way to grow up.''

PROPOSED DEALS WOULD MAKE LITTON LEADING MILITARY SHIPBUILDER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., La., Va.)  (rk) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Litton Industries, one of the nation's largest
shipbuilders, has seldom made waves. As the defense industry
consolidated around it in a series of megamergers, Litton contented
itself with a string of small acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   But with its unusual proposal Thursday to simultaneously acquire
two of its competitors, Newport News Shipbuilding and Avondale
Industries, Litton is trying to seize the moment to turn itself
from a midsized defense contractor into the leading supplier of
naval ships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an aggressive move for a company that historically has
not been aggressive,'' said Jon B. Kutler, president of Quarterdeck
Investment Partners, an investment banking firm specializing in
aerospace.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Rubel, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., agreed. ``I
give Litton a lot of credit for finding the right moment to
strike,'' he said. ``It's a cougarlike move.''
</P>
<P>
   The aggressiveness appears to reflect to some degree the
handiwork of Michael R. Brown, who became Litton's chief executive
a year ago but did not fully take over until his predecessor, John
Leonis, retired from his post as chairman in March.Brown, who
briefly played professional football for the San Diego Chargers,
recently hired a new chief financial officer, D. Michael Steuert.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors were not completely enamored of the proposed
transaction or of the new management team, sending Litton shares
down $1.625, to $63.125. The shares of a company attempting an
acquisition often fall, but investors were also apparently
disappointed that Litton executives, in a conference call with
analysts, had been vague about the cost savings they expected from
the double acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Litton, based in Woodland Hills, Calif., proposed to acquire
Newport News and Avondale in deals that were valued at a combined
$1.8 billion when announced after the close of trading on Thursday.
Litton would also assume $600 million of Newport News debt.
</P>
<P>
   The double purchase would make Litton the nation's fifth-largest
defense contractor _ it is now eighth _ and the largest
shipbuilder, surpassing the General Dynamics Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can compete on any class of ship the government wants, head
to head with General Dynamics,'' Brown said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   General Dynamics had tried to buy Newport News, but was blocked
by the Pentagon on antitrust grounds. Analysts do not expect the
Litton acquisitions to raise the same issues because they would not
leave the building of all nuclear ships in one company.
</P>
<P>
   Both Newport News and Avondale, which had agreed to merge
themselves, have said they are reviewing Litton's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be hard for them to resist this deal,'' said
Loren Thompson, a defense expert at the Lexington Institute in
Arlington, Va., referring to Newport News. He said the company was
under pressure from workers, who are striking; from the Pentagon,
to which it has promised cost cuts; and from shareholders
disappointed that the deal with General Dynamics did not go
through.
</P>
<P>
   Still, since Litton is offering to pay 0.55 share for each share
of Newport News, the drop in Litton's stock price Friday lowered
the value of its offer to $34.72 a share from $35.61 Thursday.
That, plus the fact that the offer is less than the $38.50 General
Dynamics was willing to pay, could give Newport News a reason to
reject Litton's offer or at least bargain up the price. Newport
News shares soared $5.75, to $32.75.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed acquisition of Avondale, which is worth $38 a share
in cash, seems more straightforward. Shares of Avondale, which
makes amphibious assault vehicles and auxiliary naval vessels, rose
$4.3125, to $36.0625.
</P>
<P>
   If Avondale, which is based near New Orleans, does agree to be
acquired by Litton, this could put more pressure on Newport News to
accept the deal as well, since Newport News would lose its own
opportunity to grow by acquiring Avondale. Litton has said either
acquisition could go ahead without the other.
</P>
<P>
   Litton was once a sprawling conglomerate involved in businesses
ranging from microwave ovens to oil-field services. Since divesting
its oil-field services business, Western Atlas, in 1994, it has
concentrated on shipbuilding, defense electronics and electronic
components. It has taken its cash flow from shipbuilding and used
it to build up a fourth leg of its business by buying companies
that provide computer services to government agencies.

MURDOCH TO BUY A STAKE IN THESTREET.COM

<TEXT>
<P>
   News Corp., the entertainment and news conglomerate controlled
by Rupert Murdoch, has agreed to buy a stake in TheStreet.com, the
online financial news service.
</P>
<P>
   News Corp.'s U.S. subsidiary, News America Inc., has agreed to
buy $7.5 million of the shares that TheStreet.com plans to sell in
its initial public offering, TheStreet.com disclosed in a filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 3.
</P>
<P>
   TheStreet.com plans to sell 5.5 million shares at an expected
price of $11 to $13 each. At $13 a share, the sale would raise
about $71.5 million before expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The price for News America's purchase will depend on the
offering price. In February, The New York Times Co. bought 1.32
million shares of TheStreet.com's common stock and 37,728 preferred
shares for $15 million, or about $11 a share. The purchase
consisted of $3 million in cash and $12 million in services,
according to TheStreet.com's filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a run of profitable years, hospitals across the country
face cash-flow problems _ squeezed, hospital officials say, by
slow-paying managed-care companies, cutbacks in government programs
and rapidly growing numbers of uninsured patients.
</P>
<P>
   Pressured by rising costs, hospitals are aggressively trying to
squeeze revenue from mountains of overdue bills for patient care.
</P>
<P>
   According to the hospitals, managed-care companies are routinely
delaying payments by three or four months, even in states where
delays that long are illegal, often by reporting that they have
lost track of a bill, even when it was transmitted electronically.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to their problems, hospitals are feeling the effects of
changes enacted in 1997 to the Medicare program, which covers
elderly and disabled Americans and supplies more than half the
revenue at many hospitals. The changes have reduced the hospitals'
share of growth in program payments by billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Across the board, payments for patients plummeted 20 percent
last year at the nation's most efficiently managed hospitals,
according to preliminary findings by HCIA Inc., a Baltimore company
that studies health care trends. By another widely used industry
measure, HCIA said that the 100 best-managed hospitals had to wait
64 days last year, on average, or five more days than in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The payment delays, along with rising costs for employees and
prescription drugs, are pushing hospitals to seek new price
increases, which would add to medical inflation, said John
Hindelong, a health care analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   But before raising rates, hospitals are trying new ways to
collect money. They are hiring drivers to take uninsured low-income
patients to Medicaid offices to sign up for benefits, combing
through Medicare documents seeking overlooked payments, prodding
managed-care insurers to pay more promptly and experimenting with
ways to collect from patients more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look under every rock to find money,'' said John Lavan,
executive vice president and chief financial officer of New York
Presbyterian Hospital, where almost one-third of the unpaid bills
are more than four months old.
</P>
<P>
   It is illegal in 21 states for insurers to delay payments to
hospitals by more than 30 to 60 days, but it is not uncommon for
such laws to be flouted routinely. The pain is especially sharp in
New York, where the legal limit is 45 days but managed-care
companies typically take three to four months to pay, according to
Patricia Wang, a senior vice president of the Greater New York
Hospital Association.
</P>
<P>
   Enforcement is spotty and the penalties for late filing have so
far been minor: State regulators fined 14 insurers for late
payments last month. The biggest penalty so far this year was
$91,900 in two fines assessed against Oxford Health Plans, hardly a
heavy burden for a company with $4 billion in annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
   But Leslie Moran, a spokeswoman for the New York State Health
Plans Association, said the fines were based on a ``miniscule''
number of claims among millions handled each month. She said most
delays were caused by hospital billing errors.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their cause, the late payments are tying up working
capital and will push more hospitals into operating losses if the
money is not collected, Ms. Wang said.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook is almost as dreary elsewhere. The Massachusetts
Hospital Association said recently that its members were owed $163
million by health maintenance organizations, of which $122 million
was for bills that were 90 or more days old.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center has more than $270
million in unpaid bills, and it takes 68 or 69 days, on average, to
collect, said Bernadette Lodge-Lemon, the director of patient
financial services.
</P>
<P>
   Some hospitals have looked for ways to get faster payment on the
portion of hospital bills that patients pay themselves. In some
cases, they are urging patients to use major credit cards. Visa
reported 14.5 percent growth in hospital-bill charges to its cards
last year, which accounted for $665 million of its $12.1 billion in
health care charges; Mastercard said its hospital charges were up
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But hospital officials say many patients are reluctant to use
their credit cards this way. Patients shy away from adding a big,
open-ended charge _ the total owed may not be known until weeks
after the patient goes home _ to cards that may already be near
their credit limits.
</P>
<P>
   Patients are in no big hurry to pay, either. ``The consumer
doesn't feel guilty about not paying the hospital, feeling it has
gotten paid sufficiently by the insurer,'' said Dan Cain, a health
care investment banker based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   And until recently, hospitals, especially nonprofits, have been
timid about collecting from patients. ``They are very concerned
about their public relations,'' said Ted Smith, a vice president of
the American Collectors Association, a Minneapolis-based trade
group of credit officers, banks and card companies.
</P>
<P>
   When all else fails, hospitals turn to collection agencies and
sometimes sell receivables at discounts to financial firms that are
more willing to pursue debtors.
</P>
<P>
   To keep matters from reaching that point, several dozen medical
centers have introduced credit cards just for hospital bills. Last
fall, the Atlantic Health System in New Jersey started offering
such a card, managed by Health Charge, a privately held finance
company in Chevy Chase, Md.
</P>
<P>
   With the card, patients of the system's four hospitals get 60
days to pay without owing interest; thereafter, they are charged
the prime rate plus six percentage points, or 13.75 percent as of
Friday, a moderate rate by credit card standards.
</P>
<P>
   The management company advances the hospital 50 percent of the
total bill up front and keeps 5 percent of patients' principal and
all interest paid. If the patient does not begin paying in 90 or
120 days, the hospital must return the advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works pretty smoothly, especially for patients that don't
have any insurance,'' said Diane Robinson, who tracks payments for
Atlantic Health.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only a small minority of patients are using the cards.
Atlantic Health has issued cards to just 150 patients; nationwide,
Health Charge has 8,000 card holders at 40 hospitals, according to
Paul Devereaux, the company's general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Still, health care is ``a huge market that needs capital,'' said
Robert Napoli, a financial services analyst in Chicago with ABN
Amro, a Dutch bank. Banks, he added, are ``not very good at
understanding'' health care, creating opportunities for niche
players like Health Charge.

<P>
   The price of copper has jumped 15.4 percent since its low this
year, to 70.78 cents a pound. The price of tin is up 12 percent
from its 1999 low; nickel, 41.3 percent; lead, 11.8 percent, and
aluminum, 17.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So what?
</P>
<P>
   The price of spot copper is still 17.3 percent below its 1998
high. Aluminum is down 13 percent; tin, 10.4 percent; lead, 10.2
percent, and nickel, 6 percent. The prices of these metals, all
traded on the London Metal Exchange, are even further below their
highs of the last big commodity rally, which reached its peaks in
1995 and 1996. (And at the same time, agricultural commodities,
except for hogs, are still declining.)
</P>
<P>
   For for all kinds of investors, there are reasons to be
concerned. But there is one issue _ inflation _ that is not worth
worrying about yet.
</P>
<P>
   The recent rise in industrial commodity prices is important
because it could help lead to rising wages and, therefore, more
inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
   One of the recent surprises for economists has been the slowdown
in the rate of wage increases, despite a drop in unemployment. The
April employment data released on Friday showed that the increase
in average hourly earnings had slowed to 3.4 percent in the last
year, below the 3.8 percent for the 12 months ended in December.
</P>
<P>
   One theory to explain it is that the sharp decline in the
inflation rate in 1998 tempered wage demands. The Consumer Price
Index rose just 1.6 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency
Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., thinks the CPI will end the year up
about 2 percent. That is not a major increase. But he thinks that
the jump in oil and gasoline prices will temporarily push the
annual rate of increase in the CPI to 2.5 percent. And that
headline, he said, ``will not play well in Peoria, and it could
well affect pay negotiations later this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The price increases in metals could also signal that the global
economy is turning around, a fact that would make a slowdown here
less likely and a rate increase by the Federal Reserve, to put a
drag on growth, more likely.
</P>
<P>
   What is happening globally is one of the most important
questions for investors over the next several months. The selloff
last week in the bond market, which pushed the yield on the 30-year
bond up to 5.81 percent, the highest in almost a year, was prompted
in part by the fear that a rebound in Asia and Europe would make a
slowdown here almost impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, compounded that
concern by saying on Thursday that the global financial crisis
appears to have passed. He said the threat was now that low
employment would drive wages _ and inflation _ higher.
</P>
<P>
   If commodity prices are accelerating, Shepherdson said, ``it is
more likely that the world economy is turning around.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepherdson and other economists caution that, as of now, this
is the likely, but not the certain, outcome. There are not enough
data yet to prove that the global economy has turned around.
</P>
<P>
   While South Korea and some other Asian countries are showing
signs of revival, Japan is still a big question mark. And Europe is
sluggish despite the surprising interest-rate cut last month by the
European Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   William O'Neill, director of futures research at Merrill Lynch,
said: ``It is premature to say that commodities are telling us that
we are heading to a new global economic boom. But the worst may be
over.''
</P>
<P>
   What is not to worry about is that inflation is going to shoot
dangerously higher. ``We're not set for a big commodity or
inflation boom,'' O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   A main reason is that commodities constitute such a small part
of American products, making up less than 10 percent of the total
cost, according to Shepherdson. And companies can offset the higher
costs. So outside of oil and gasoline, it is very difficult to
predict what portion of commodity price increases will reach the
consumer.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Chubb Corp., an insurance company known for the
gilt-edged coverage favored by some of the wealthiest Americans,
held its annual meeting last month at its headquarters in Warren,
N.J., there was a prickly item on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders, led by a union that owns $1.63 million of Chubb
stock, a small fraction of the total, wanted to do away with the
company's poison-pill provision, intended to foil hostile
takeovers.
</P>
<P>
   The company strongly opposed the move. Yet nearly 70 percent of
the ballot-casting shareholders voted to get rid of the poison
pill, backing the contention that a sale of the company _ whether
through a hostile takeover or otherwise _ might well increase the
value of the shares.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the poison pill, a device created in the early 1980s
by a New York lawyer to combat the advances of a horde of corporate
raiders, is perhaps the hottest issue in corporate governance in
this season of annual meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The provisions vary, but they tend to make hostile takeovers
impractical. One technique is to issue large numbers of shares to
existing shareholders, thus diluting the value of a hostile
bidder's stake.
</P>
<P>
   Many poison pills that were instituted a decade ago are up for
renewal, and shareholders at a half-dozen companies have taken
steps to get rid of them.
</P>
<P>
   For years, shareholders have voted to recommend that companies
get rid of poison pills, but management has found it easy to ignore
these moves. Now, shareholders are upping the ante, trying to force
change through bylaw amendments. The law on whether companies will
have to comply is still evolving.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after the Chubb vote, 52 percent of the voting
shareholders of Union Carbide supported such an amendment to
eliminate their company's poison pill. This week, there will be
votes at Quaker Oats and at US West, with a vote at J.C. Penney set
for next week.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the debate over poison pills is whether they
help or hurt the price of a company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   The most vocal shareholders, mainly public and union pension
funds, say poison pills scare away potential bidders and keep
prices down. Yet the 2,000 or so companies with poison pills say
the very nature of the provisions is to prevent a potential buyer
from taking control simply by amassing shares and, instead, to
force negotiations with management for a higher sale price.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have studies to back up their arguments. And John
Coffee, a securities law professor at Columbia University, says
that to some extent, both sides are right.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line with a poison pill, he said, is this: ``You
reduce the probability of a takeover bid being made, which
shareholders don't like. But, on the other hand, you increase the
premium for shareholders if a bid is made.''
</P>
<P>
   The poison-pill confrontations are another chapter in a
long-running campaign by institutional shareholders to gain a
greater voice in corporate governance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing we don't like about poison pills is that the
board gets to make all the decisions in the event of a takeover
bid,'' said Michael Zucker, the director of corporate and financial
affairs for the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile
Employees, which led the vote against Chubb's poison pill. That
situation, he said, often has a negative financial impact.
</P>
<P>
   John Wilcox, the chairman of Georgeson &AMP; Co., a proxy
solicitation firm that is working for Chubb, says shareholders
delegate authority to their board for many things, including poison
pills. ``You can't say you're going to invest millions in this
company, but that you don't trust these people at all when it comes
to takeover bids,'' Wilcox said. ``The role of shareholders is to
elect directors, not to micro-manage how companies run.''
</P>
<P>
   Another shareholder objection to poison pills is that they
provide job protection to managers whose poor performance has
propelled a decline of share values to the point where raiders are
attracted. That, however, is not the issue at Chubb. Though its
stock is down nearly 21 percent from its 52-week high last July,
its chief executive, Dean O'Hare, and his staff are highly regarded
by shareholders and analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Wilcox acknowledged that shareholders and boards often have
conflicting goals. ``Managers want to preserve the enterprise,'' he
said, ``and shareholders want to get their money and get out of
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Two companies whose poison pills were challenged this year _ St.
Paul Cos., an insurer, and International Flavors and Fragrances _
agreed to eliminate the devices without a vote being taken. But
Chubb has taken a defiant stand.
</P>
<P>
   While discussions were under way with the Needletrades Union
pension fund on preparations for the shareholder vote at Chubb, the
company's board simply revoked the existing poison pill and created
a new one designed to run for 10 years. In its proxy, Chubb said
its lawyers had concluded that under New Jersey law, the board has
exclusive authority over poison pills.
</P>
<P>
   When a majority of shareholders voted against a poison pill,
Chubb refused to recognize the results. ``We don't intend to do
anything,'' said Gail Devlin, a senior vice president who handles
investor relations at Chubb.
</P>
<P>
   The union is considering suing. Earlier this year, a federal and
a state court in Oklahoma upheld the right of shareholders to
eliminate a poison pill through a bylaw amendment, as they did at
Chubb. But New Jersey's courts are free to come to their own
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Delaware, where many of the biggest American companies are
incorporated, has yet to deal with whether shareholders can abolish
poison pills. But its courts have tended not to curtail the
authority of corporate boards, and some experts believe that New
Jersey, which has little case law on corporate matters, could be
influenced by Delaware.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ At 7 p.m. on a Monday evening in Miamisburg,
outside the whitewashed two-story building behind Sara Jane's
Restaurant on South Main Street, you can hear the Rev. Bernard Dada
shouting at God.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do it, Jesus. Do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We Africans shout at God,'' he explains, exuberant with a
wide, shiny smile.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, God spoke to Dada in the bedroom of his home in Agbor
in midwestern Nigeria. ``He said, `Go to Dayton, Ohio, and pray for
revival there,''' Dada says, his accent thick. ``I said, `Where is
it?' Dayton, Ohio? I couldn't even pronounce it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dada, a 43-year-old British seminary graduate, hastened to a
map and saw it was near Cincinnati, a city he had once visited.
Then he hastened to the visa office to explain his calling. A visa
was granted, more expeditiously than usual, Dada claims. He
promised to return to his wife and four children.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton's evangelical community has welcomed Dada without
skepticism, believing his coming from afar is surely a sign that
Dayton is God's chosen site for revival that will spread throughout
the country, says the Rev. Don McMurry of the Greater Dayton
Baptist Association in Huber Heights. If the faithful will only
pray.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor Bill Hoerr of Centerville met Dada during a visit to
Africa several years ago. He welcomed him and helped him to find
shelter here.
</P>
<P>
   For the past four months, he has made the rounds to dozens of
area churches, crossing denominations. He preached at Courthouse
Square on Thursday in observance of the National Day of Prayer.
</P>
<P>
   And on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays, Dada's revival prayer
meetings have drawn as many as 170 people of various denominations,
races and classes to the low-ceilinged makeshift sanctuary.

   SEATTLE _ Material Mom. She wants silks and sapphires, truffles

or to buy gas to go see your mom.''

   Susan Nelson, fresh from a visit to Seattle Aquarium with son
Christopher, 2{, said she wants only health and happiness for her
family. Christopher was born after four attempts at in-vitro
fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a miracle to us, so Mother's Day is very special,'' said
the 42-year-old mother.
</P>
<P>
   Even many of the children we stopped were in heavy-thinking
mode. ``If I could get my Mom anything, I'd get her surgery for her
throat. She has these nodes on it,'' said 13-year-old Stephanie
Ashmore, at The Market with her family.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Seattle Aquarium, Lizeth Cervantes, 10, told why she
wanted to buy her mother a trip to Mexico. ``She needs tickets to
go see her mother and to stay there for five months, because she
hasn't seen her in eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   Time was the only thing most moms wanted spent on Mother's Day _
time with the family and, for a few hours, time alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want is so easy,'' said Liz Snyder, shopping downtown
with her 2{-year-old daughter. ``I want her father to take her for
the whole day so I can sleep and hang out and do my toenails if I
want to.''
</P>
<P>
   At Westlake Center, surrounded by shops full of 14-karat gold
jewelry and slinky lingerie, mothers described the gifts that
mattered most to them _ the bouquets of weeds, the clay vases made
with tissue-paper flowers, the coupon book with promises to wash
the dishes and sweep the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I like to get is the pictures she makes for me _ pictures
of girls in dresses and flowers and rainbows,'' said Nancy Millard,
visiting the mall with her daughter Julia, 5{.
</P>
<P>
   Millard described going through her grandmother's keepsakes and
finding a Mother's Day card she had given Grandma as a child. ``I
had drawn a horse on it. I was 8 or 9,'' said Millard. ``Those are
the things mothers remember. No one remembers The Stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Relaxing in the Food Court at Westlake Center, Claire Bangasser
touched her heart as she talked. ``Mothers don't want the blenders
and the coffee machines. All we want is a hug from our children.
And the older you get, the more hugs you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Bangasser, mother of two grown daughters, was visiting from
France, where Mother's Day is celebrated the fourth Sunday of the
month. In America, it's always the second Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrations of motherhood trace back to ancient Greece, where
spring celebrants gave thanks to Rhea, the mother of the gods. The
American holiday was the suggestion of Julia Ward Howe in 1872.
</P>
<P>
   Ward, who wrote the words to ``The Battle Hymn of the
Republic,'' wanted Mother's Day dedicated to peace. And, despite
the American marketing blitz, that theme survives.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I would like is to have a peaceful world for my
grandchildren to grow up in,'' said Gina Brewington, who has seven
grandchildren. ``I would like them to grow up to be people who care
about others, respect others and are responsible, happy citizens
who love America.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a tall order, and impossible to wrap.
</P>
<P>
   But _ like a mother's love _ the price is right.

   Offerings Online? Better Get in Line
</P>
<P>
   Investors who signed up with online brokerages to get access to
potentially lucrative initial public offerings of stocks are
instead getting a lesson in the laws of supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Andrew D. Klein, founder of the fast-growing Wit
Capital, an on-line brokerage firm in New York, sent a message to
the company's 41,000 customers, pointedly asking them to stop
calling to inquire about the status of newly offered shares they
might be seeking to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appreciate that many of you are frustrated by the fact that
you have not received allocations in our IPOs,'' the message said.
``As we have told you in the past, the demand in the market has
outstripped the supply.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Wit declined to comment, because the company has
entered the quiet period after the registration of its own initial
offering.
</P>
<P>
   Also last week, The Wall Street Journal reported, 500 customers
of Datek Online of Iselin, N.J., had their accounts credited with
shares from Goldman Sachs Group's much sought-after initial
offering on Tuesday, only to be told later that the shares did not
exist. The mistake was a result of a ``communications breakdown''
with Goldman, said Robert O. Bethge, chief marketing officer for
Datek.
</P>
<P>
   Bethge was philosophical. Now, he said, ``we know some of the
pitfalls.''
</P>
<P>
   401(k)s: MORE STOCKS, MORE OPTIONS, MORE ASSETS
</P>
<P>
   Investors in 401(k) and similar savings plans have been
contributing more to stocks and less to safer investments,
according to a new study by Spectrem Group of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Spectrem found that the retirement savers increased their
contribution allocations to equities to 75.7 percent by the end of
1998, from 64.4 percent in 1994. Allocations to bond funds
decreased slightly, to 7.2 percent from 8.5 percent, while those to
super-safe stable-value funds, which often offer low but consistent
returns, plummeted to 9.3 percent from 17.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The firm surveyed 2,000 households in July and August of last
year. It also found a growing number of investment options in
401(k) plans _ an average of 8.4 last year, versus 4.6 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Helped by the surging stock market, the mean account balance
grew to $40,740 in 1998 from $31,700 in 1994. Just 34.4 percent of
those surveyed had balances of less than $10,000 in 1998, compared
with 38.9 percent in 1994. And 18.4 percent had accounts of
$100,000 or more, more than twice the 7.1 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   A NEW FUND MANAGER? DON'T WORRY, BE HAPPY
</P>
<P>
   Investors who bite their nails when a portfolio manager departs
a favorite mutual fund may well be fretting needlessly. A new study
by Value Line, the research firm, has found that funds with new
managers tend to go through a relatively brief, one-year period of
lagging performance vis-a-vis their peers, but then go on to beat
them over the three-year period after the change.
</P>
<P>
   The study looked at two groups of new managers and compared
their returns with those of other managers with longer tenures.
</P>
<P>
   The managers in the first group started running their funds in
February 1998. They returned 1.65 percent, on average, for the 12
months through February 1999, versus 2.69 percent for the tenured
managers.
</P>
<P>
   The second group of new managers started two years earlier, in
February 1996. They returned 12.07 percent for the three years
through February 1999, compared with 9.52 percent for a peer group
of tenured managers, the study showed.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups of new managers, as well as their peer groups of
old-timers, included equity and fixed-income fund managers. There
was a minimum of 60 fund managers in each group.
</P>
<P>
   The study suggested three factors in the initial
underperformance:
</P>
<P>
   _ New managers often take over sagging funds, and it may take a
while to sell underperforming securities.
</P>
<P>
   _ The time spent deciding how to turn around a fund may take
time away from the process of selecting securities.
</P>
<P>
   _ Returns may suffer as a new manager incurs the expenses of
selling off holdings.
</P>
<P>
   As for the better three-year performance of new managers, Omer
Mohammed, issue chief of the Value Line Mutual Fund Survey, which
published the study, attributed it to the skill of fund company
executives in hiring replacements.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the aggregate, the fund families do a good job at replacing
these managers with ones that will outperform,'' he said.
</P>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ AT&AMP;T'S transformation from telecommunications
dinosaur to technology-stock dynamo may have been clinched this
week with the company's $58 billion deal to buy MediaOne Group, one
of the nation's biggest cable television operators.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, combined with the recent purchase of
Tele-Communications Inc., means that AT&AMP;T will become the largest
cable company in the United States, with 16 million customers and
networks reaching more than 26 million homes.
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne is the latest in a spate of acquisitions _ $124 billion
worth _ made by C. Michael Armstrong since he took the top job at
AT&AMP;T 18 months ago. The deal maker has morphed the 114-year-old
behemoth into the kind of hot technology concern favored by day
traders on the Internet. Widows and orphans, say hello to the
Motley Fool.
</P>
<P>
   The vision that Armstrong, 60, has for his company is vast.
``The new AT&AMP;T is a global communications company that can satisfy
customers end to end with any service, anywhere,'' he said in an
interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Can he really provide local and long-distance phone service,
wireless communications, Internet access and cable TV service to
consumers around the world?
</P>
<P>
   Taking a vision this large and turning it into reality will take
years, of course. The technical challenges are daunting. But while
at AT&AMP;T, Armstrong has turned skeptics into believers by making
good on all that he has promised so far.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue growth and earnings targets have been met. The $1.6
billion he vowed to cut from expenses in two years vanished in one.
And the 15,000 jobs he planned to cut over 24 months became 20,000
jobs eliminated in 12.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, AT&AMP;T, unlike technology upstarts, had $53
billion in revenues last year, $6.4 billion in earnings and _
what's this? _ a dividend. At Friday's close of $60.4375, the stock
yielded 1.46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Powers, senior technology analyst at Edward Jones in St.
Louis, said AT&AMP;T was well positioned to capitalize on the need for
increased network capacity, known as bandwidth, to reduce data
bottlenecks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, people looked at AT&AMP;T and saw the bulk of their
revenues came from consumer long distance, a business under
attack,'' Powers said. ``And AT&AMP;T equipment had fallen behind the
technology curve. But now the focus is going from consumer long
distance to a company offering these broadband pipes, a much more
exciting player.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, 60, is rooted in technology. He spent 31 years at
IBM, starting in 1961, and managed research and development of Big
Blue's communications systems and personal computers from 1981 to
1987, years of much turmoil in the PC business. He was running IBM
Latin America when he left in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's chief also knows how to refashion a company under siege.
From 1992 to 1997, he was chairman of General Motors' Hughes
Electronics division, a defense contractor he dragged into the
commercial satellite business when the cold war ended. GM's Class H
shares more than quadrupled during Armstrong's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But his biggest act yet may be turning stodgy AT&AMP;T into a
top-performing technology stock that even a conservative investor
can love. The stock has risen almost 20 percent so far this year.
But at 28 times trailing earnings, it is downright cheap for an
Internet play. Especially one that has real assets, a healthy
balance sheet and, perhaps best of all, management over the age of
consent.

MILITARY RELEASES DETAILS OF AMERICAN SOLDIERS' CAPTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO closed its posts along the Macedonian border
after three American soldiers on routine patrols there were
ambushed and captured by Yugoslavs six weeks ago, the Army
commander of the soldiers said.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. David Grange said Friday that NATO had kept the
observation posts open throughout March despite the attacks on the
U.S. Embassy in the Macedonian capital, Skopje, and the rising
tensions along the border. It only decided to close the posts after
the American soldiers were captured.
</P>
<P>
   During a briefing on the nearly completed military investigation
of the soldiers' monthlong captivity, Grange insisted that the
three soldiers were more than one mile inside Macedonia when they
were captured by Yugoslav troops on March 31.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslavs seemed surprised to run into the American team
that was patrolling an emergency extraction route, the general
said, but once they spied the Americans, at least 15 Yugoslav
soldiers, some hidden in haystacks, quickly surrounded the
soldiers' armored Humvee. Firing an array of weapons, including an
anti-tank rocket launcher, they disabled the Humvee's engine and
forced the three American soldiers to surrender without firing a
shot.
</P>
<P>
   The three soldiers, Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, Staff Sgt.
Andrew A. Ramirez and Spc. Steven M. Gonzales, were then knocked to
the ground and beaten even though they had raised their hands in
surrender, Grange said in the fullest official account of the
soldiers' captivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were kicked repeatedly in the face, the head and other
parts of their body. They were tied up and hoods were placed over
their heads,'' Grange said. ``Several times they were threatened
with rifles pointed at their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   One soldier told investigators that his initial captors had said
they would cut off his ears.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from the U.S. Army's Europe headquarters in Heidelberg,
Germany, Grange told reporters that the three men then embarked on
a disjointed odyssey, moving from prison to prison until they
reached their final destination in or near Belgrade. They suffered
the worst treatment during their first week of captivity, including
four painful interrogations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were beaten, sometimes with batons,'' the general said.
``They were almost always hooded, forced to sleep in uncomfortable
positions on the floor, feet shackled, or in a chair. When they
moved from those positions, they were hit on their hands and feet.
Their hands were kept secured behind their backs, their arms
constantly going numb, except when allowed to eat, when their hands
were tied to the front.''
</P>
<P>
   While the men were beaten at every prison and were always kept
in isolation, the treatment improved as the days wore on.
</P>
<P>
   Once installed in a civilian prison in the Belgrade area, they
were supplied with clean Yugoslav uniforms and put in solitary
cells with water and a toilet, but there were still two shifts of
guards for the daily beatings, the general said. Nonetheless, Stone
``in a moment of happiness'' did write a letter that was read over
Serb television praising the few guards who showed him some
kindness, the general said.
</P>
<P>
   The three soldiers were released on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Since their initial capture, the Pentagon has denied Yugoslav
claims that the Americans were inside Serbia when the Yugoslav
soldiers captured them on March 3l.
</P>
<P>
   Stone, the leader of the three-man patrol, had radioed half of
the necessary coordinates confirming his group's whereabouts at the
moment of their capture, said Grange, who said he was unsure
whether Stone had used his satellite positioning device, or GPS, as
well as his maps to come up with his coordinates.
</P>
<P>
   But citing Stone's eight years of experience as a scout and his
familiarity with the rocky border terrain, the general said that
``if you took Stone's GPS and map away, he would have known where
he was. And I'm convinced of that because I've been out there with
him.''

INVESTING WITH BERNICE S. BEHAR: JOHN HANCOCK EMERGING GROWTH
FUND

 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Portfolio managers who limit themselves to small-capitalization
stocks face a recurring quandary: Their best performers grow into
mid- and large-cap stocks, forcing them to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Bernice S. Behar, lead manager of the $650 million John Hancock
Emerging Growth fund, understands the problem _ and welcomes it.
``Our goal is to buy companies that graduate out of the fund, like
Starbucks and E(STAR)Trade,'' she said, referring to two previous
stock picks. (Actually, the fund still holds a small amount of
Starbucks shares.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Behar succeeds by finding stocks that benefit from economic,
demographic or industry trends like outsourcing and Internet
growth. ``The linchpin for us is finding companies that are
exploiting a change,'' she said from her Boston office, overlooking
the Charles River. &UR;  &LR;  In a period when many small-company stock
funds have struggled, Emerging Growth has turned in a solid
performance. It returned 12.8 percent, annualized, for the three
years ended April 30, versus 5.6 percent for the average small
growth fund, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial
publisher. And for the 12 months ended April 30, the fund returned
5.9 percent, versus a loss of 4.9 percent for the peer group.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Behar, 38, came to money management via Tokyo, where she
studied at the International Christian University. Her fluency in
Japanese helped lead to a job at Sanyo Securities America in New
York, as an analyst focusing on Japanese stocks. She moved to
Boston in 1990 to work as an analyst on John Hancock's Pacific
Basin fund, and soon began focusing on small-cap U.S. stocks in a
variety of positions.
</P>
<P>
   She looks for companies with revenue and earnings growth of at
least 20 percent a year. But she said she shuns using computer
screens to find them: ``We take a bottom-up, analytic approach,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Behar personally covers retail, consumer-product and
business-services stocks. One other manager focuses on technology,
another on health care, and a third on media, entertainment and
education. Their industry expertise helps pinpoint companies that
offer both outstanding growth potential and top-flight executives. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  ``Management takes on a heightened importance in small
companies,'' she said, ``because they need not only a vision of
where their market is but how the company will grow to serve the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Behar considers unloading stocks that lag behind the Russell
2000 Growth index or their industry groups for a year from the time
they are bought.
</P>
<P>
   Small-cap growth stocks, of course, are an especially risky lot.
``These stocks can be quite volatile because of the lack of
liquidity,'' she said, ``and the companies themselves are volatile
because they're in their early stages of development.''
</P>
<P>
   Diversification helps to lower the fund's risks. The fund owns
180 companies, each accounting for just 0.4 percent to 1.4 percent
of assets.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Behar doesn't buy the tiniest companies _ or stocks with
little liquidity. She looks for those with market capitalizations
of at least $100 million and a 10-day average trading volume of at
least 100,000 shares.
</P>
<P>
   In February, she bought shares of Pacific Sunwear of California,
a retailer with 350 stores nationwide, for $27.54 a share. The
company sells casual clothing for teen-age boys, a fast-growing
group, Ms. Behar said. She said the company's management is adept
in a fickle business, shifting rapidly as fashion trends change.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Anaheim, Calif., is introducing a line of
clothes geared toward older customers _ in their early 20s.
</P>
<P>
   She expects Pacific Sunwear to earn $1.50 a share this year, and
she sees annualized earnings growth of 30 percent over the next
three years. The stock closed on Friday at $34.125.
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite is Getty Images of Seattle, which provides
images to advertising companies, magazines and newspapers and which
last week agreed to buy Art.com, a Chicago-based seller of art
images, for up to $202 million in cash and stock. Getty has a
library of 30 million images; customers use them in lieu of hiring
photographers. Getty recently signed an agreement with Amazon.com
to supply photographs for that company's on-line greeting cards.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Behar first bought Getty Images shares in March 1998 at
$19.29 each. She expects the company, which lost $36.4 million last
year, to post a 28 percent increase in after-tax cash flow in 1999
and to become profitable in 2001. The stock closed on Friday at
$27.875.
</P>
<P>
   A third holding is Exodus Communications of Santa Clara, Calif.,
a company that develops and maintains Web sites. Clients include
Yahoo, Ebay and Lycos. One positive for the stock, of course, is
the growth of the Internet, she said, ``but it's also an
outsourcing play because it costs companies six times as much to
develop and run their Web site themselves than to have Exodus do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund first bought Exodus stock in March 1998, at $15. The
company lost $66.4 million in 1998, but she figures that its gross
revenues will grow 70 percent a year, on average, over the next two
years, and that it will be profitable by the fourth quarter of
2000. The stock closed on Friday at $80.50.

VICTORIA OFFICIALS DEFEND DUMPING RAW SEWAGE INTO STRAIT

<TEXT>
<P>
   VICTORIA, B.C. _ Despite protests from the United States and a
lawsuit filed by a labor union and environmental group,
Victoria-area officials continue to dump of millions of gallons of
untreated sewage into the Strait of Juan de Fuca, saying the
environmental impact is ``minimal.''
</P>
<P>
   In a report released this week, the Capital Regional District,
an umbrella organization of local governments, said: ``Water
quality at beaches in the vicinity of the outfalls is not adversely
affected by the two outfalls.''
</P>
<P>
   Sewage discharges average more than 20 million gallons a day
from the two release points.
</P>
<P>
   The report, issued on the eve of a meeting of U.S. and Canadian
mayors, failed to quell calls for the British Columbia capital to
treat its effluent before discharging it into the international
waterway.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to have to do something,'' Seattle Mayor Paul
Schell, a co-convenor of the Cascadia Mayors Association, said at
the meeting Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bellingham Mayor Mark Asmundson, whose city just south of the
Canadian border spent $45 million to build a secondary sewage
treatment plant, added: ``Tourism is the big deal here. Tourism is
the economic engine. I would think their attention to this
particular environmental issue would be higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Cost estimates for treating Victoria's sewage have ranged from
$90 million to $600 million (Canadian), and neither the provincial
nor Canadian federal governments have shown any eagerness to pay
much of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   David Anderson, Canada's minister of fisheries and Victoria's
member of parliament, argued in a recent interview that cold,
fast-moving waters of the Strait of Juan de Fuca effectively
disperse and oxygenate the sewage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sewage is treated naturally,'' Anderson said. ``Within
meters of the discharge outfalls, you have sailboarders. Within 400
meters, the sewage is barely detectable. It is one of the few
places in the world where this occurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1983, however, the fisheries ministry has closed
down shellfish harvesting in waters near the discharge outfalls in
Victoria and nearby Esquimalt. The closure area now totalsmore
than 30 square miles of the Strait of Juan de Fuca.
</P>
<P>
   ``They discharge enough effluent to fill 50 Olympic-sized
swimming pools a day. ... How can they say there are no impacts?''
said John Werring, an attorney with the Sierra Legal Defense Fund.
Along with the United Fishermen and Allied Workers Union, the
environmental group has filed a lawsuit to halt the sewage dumping.
It is due to be heard in Victoria provincial court next month.
</P>
<P>
   The sewage dumping has prompted protests in the United States,
even a 1994 effort by some Seattle-area yacht owners to boycott the
annual Swiftsure race over the Memorial Day weekend. Sen. Slade
Gorton, R-Wash., and Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., asked the U.S. State
Department to take up the issue with Canada's federal government.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the Capital Regional District committed to acquiring a
site for a sewage treatment plant within three to five years. It
made a similar commitment in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But no land has been purchased. The provincial government has
ordered the regional district to find a treatment plant site, but
B.C. Environment Minister Cathy McGregor recently granted a
seven-month extension on plans. The Capital Regional District now
has until Dec. 31 to find a site.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the mayors' meeting, Victoria Mayor Bob Cross touted
his city's environment as its primary attraction. ``The
satisfaction with the environment and quality of life is perhaps
the most notable feature of Victoria,'' Cross said.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, asked about the sewage dumping, Cross took a
conciliatory approach. ``We can't stand still in today's world. We
have to move forward,'' he acknowledged. Cross predicted a site
will be found by year's end, and that sewage treatment in some form
will come within 5-10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But Cross added that getting provincial or federal money ``is an
uphill battle ... the big question.''
</P>
<P>
   Former British Columbia Premier Mike Harcourt joked that
Victoria used to be derided as a staid town of ``the newly wed and
the nearly dead.'' But it is now one of Canada's fastest growing
metropolitan areas. British Columbia's capital city and its
surrounding suburbs have a population of more than 350,000.
</P>
<P>
   Noted Werring: ``We are talking about waste from a significant
number of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Secondary sewage treatment, a process adopted by U.S. cities
across the water from Victoria, involves construction of a
treatment plant. The plant holds ponds in which solids are settled.
The remaining liquid sewage is treated with micro-organisms which
remove objectional materials.
</P>
<P>
   With federal help, Vancouver-area governments are spending about
$196 million (Canadian) for a secondary treatment plant at Lulu
Island, on the Fraser River south of Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria is looking at several other options, including simple
screening, in which sewage is chopped up. Another is sand filtering
of sewage, and another is treatment with chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Schell said he would do some quiet lobbying of Victoria-area
mayors to get moving on treatment. ``It is something that so
negatively impacts us,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Cross seemed to acknowledge that years of delay are coming to an
end, but was not ready to predict what will be done and when. ``We
can't just do nothing,'' said Victoria's mayor. ``We have to start
planning.''

BEFORE SALON'S OFFERING, SOME NEGATIVE REVIEWS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 9) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By SANA SIWOLOP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is one thing for investors to bet their money on an initial
public offering of an Internet company with a speculative but
potentially lucrative business model.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say next month's planned offering of Salon Internet
seems to go several steps further: asking investors to put money
into a flawed business model that happens to operate online.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, Salon has operated as a Internet opinion magazine.
(Think The Village Voice without the classifieds.) Contributors
include Garrison Keillor and Camille Paglia. Yet analysts say that
the business falls short on a number of fronts _ and that they are
just plain confused about some numbers in the prospectus.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Salon said it had about 1.2 million Internet
visitors in March of this year, a healthy increase from 790,000 in
March 1998. The numbers sound impressive.
</P>
<P>
   But Media Metrix, a company that measures Web traffic, isn't
sure what the numbers refer to. It counted 521,000 Salon visitors
in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
   According to Doug McFarland, senior vice president of Media
Metrix, Salon's larger traffic numbers may take international users
into account. But it is also likely, he said, that Salon, like many
other Internet companies, is counting the total number of server
hits that its sites receive, rather than individual users.
</P>
<P>
   Salon, based in San Francisco, declined to comment because the
company has entered the quiet period after the registration of its
offering. But on April 28, Kaitlin Quistgaard, an associate editor
at Salon, wrote an article on the site that took issue with Media
Metrix's methodology for measuring traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Another worry is Salon's short roster of paying users in its
Salon Member program, which furnishes members with e-mail and
discounts on Salon merchandise. It costs as little as $20 a year,
yet had only about 1,050 members as of March.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salon doesn't present a compelling traffic story,'' said
Patrick Keane, an analyst at Jupiter Communications, a consulting
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Salon is trying to attract more paying members. In March, it
bought the Well, a virtual community that at the time had 7,000
paying members, for an undisclosed amount. In early April, Salon
announced that it planned to add more news to its own site.
</P>
<P>
   But Neil Barsky, co-founder of the Midtown Research Group, which
tracks initial offerings, said Salon's ``huge'' amount of content,
and its move to provide more news, makes for a high-cost business
model.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of advertising raises a flag, too. During the nine
months ended Dec. 31, so-called barter transactions, in which it
swaps free ads with other companies, accounted for $307,000, or 15
percent, of Salon's $2.1 million in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The offering is expected to be priced at $10.50 to $13.50 a
share. With 10.73 million shares outstanding, that would give Salon
a market value of $113 million to $145 million. The company, which
will officially change its name to Salon.com, plans to sell 2.5
million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Internet companies, Salon loses money. But analysts
are concerned that its expenses are so much greater than revenue.
For the nine months ended Dec. 31, Salon lost $4.3 million on
revenue of $2.1 million, versus a loss of $2.9 million on revenue
of $689,000 for the comparable 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many investors want quick profits on new Internet
stocks, selling them shortly after the offerings. But Salon is
going public via an online process introduced recently by W.R.
Hambrecht &AMP; Co., a San Francisco brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   Hambrecht conducts so-called Dutch auctions, in which the price
is set at the highest possible level that allows all shares to be
sold. So Salon's stock probably won't get the initial pop in price
that many other Internet stocks have enjoyed.

BRITISH COUPLE AMONG MISSING AFTER OKLAHOMA TORNADO 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KEVIN MORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ A missing British couple touring America in a
rented motor home are believed to have been swept up in the immense
tornado that tore through central Oklahoma this week, officials
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   John and Barbara Potton and 23-year-old Tram Bui of Seminole,
Okla., are the last three people known missing since the killer
tornado roared across Interstate 35 Monday evening during a rampage
that killed at least 41 other people, said Ray Blakeney, spokesman
for the state medical examiner's office.
</P>
<P>
   The Pottons, whose hometown in England was withheld by the
medical examiner's office, called relatives there around 3 p.m.
Monday from somewhere in southern Oklahoma City, Blakeney said. The
couple, said to be in their 60s, have not been heard from since,
even though Tuesday was the birthday of John Potton's mother,
Blakeney said.
</P>
<P>
   Bui, her husband and two children sought shelter from the huge
tornado under an I-35 overpass in southern Oklahoma City, Blakeney
said.
</P>
<P>
   The husband led the children up under the roadway and the mother
trailed, struggling against driving rain and wind, witnesses told
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The father laid down on top of his two children and I think
another gentleman was trying to hold on to her, from what was
reported,'' Blakeney said. ``When the storm was over she was
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Blakeney refused to release Bui's husband's name or details
about her two children.
</P>
<P>
   Although the list of those reported missing was cut to three
from more than 100 on Wednesday, specially trained dogs brought in
by federal officials from Nebraska, New Mexico, Missouri and
Washington state continued Friday to search areas of Moore, one of
the suburbs in which hundreds of homes were blasted apart.
</P>
<P>
   While local police used dogs to search all damaged areas earlier
in the week, the dogs brought in by Federal Emergency Management
Agency officials Thursday are capable of searching wreckage off
their leashes, following hand and arm signals from their handlers
standing many yards away.
</P>
<P>
   The dog searches were expected to end Saturday and cleanup and
recovery efforts were to begin in earnest over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA should have three service centers opened in Oklahoma City,
Midwest City and Del City by early next week, said Jeff Chalmers,
of the Oklahoma Department of Civil Emergency Management.
</P>
<P>
   A mobile service center in which people can seek federal aid
also will be working in stricken areas, Chalmers said.
</P>
<P>
   In Midwest City, dozens of volunteers turned out to help begin
cleanup Friday, Fire Chief Mike Bower said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're actually starting to get back to normal a little bit,''
Bower said. ``The streets are open.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 Midwest City homes were destroyed and more than
600 were damaged, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Five hotels and several apartment complexes also fell victim to
the tornado in Midwest City, Bower said.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Fred Jordan said all but one
of the 41 bodies of tornado victims had been turned over to
families by late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Teams from the medical examiner's office and police using dogs
have searched intensively in the area where Bui disappeared and
found no trace of her body, Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have searched for signs of the Pottons' motor home by
air and on the ground, Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Blakeney said helicopter searches for the Pottons and Bui would
be suspended for security reasons during President Clinton's visit
to the disaster area Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Blakeney said every damaged vehicle that has been found has been
searched.
</P>
<P>
   Police began to open more of the damaged areas in Moore, Midwest
City, Del City and other areas to residents and property owners on
Friday
</P>
<P>
   ``Bit by bit, we're shrinking the restricted areas but we're
limiting access only to those people who live there and people who
are working for them,'' said Oklahoma City police Capt. Charles
Allen. ``But many areas are still without power, many are still
dangerous because we have a lot of rubble and unsafe conditions.
</P>
<P>
   County health officials have conducted health inspections at Red
Cross, church and other shelters serving meals to storm victims.
All water systems in the county have been approved for drinking
water as well, health officials reported.

LAWYER ISSUES DENIAL FOR LOS ALAMOS SCIENTIST ACCUSED OF SPYING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.M.)  (rk) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The lawyer for Wen Ho Lee, a scientist fired from
his job at Los Alamos National Laboratory for violations of
security rules, has issued his first detailed denial of allegations
that his client spied for China.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, issued on Thursday by Los Angeles lawyer Mark
Holscher, says that Lee has never handed over secret information to
China, and that Lee and his wife have helped the FBI in other
counterintelligence matters.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a Taiwan-born scientist who worked at Los Alamos for more
than 20 years, has been the focus of the FBI's investigation into
China's suspected theft of American nuclear secrets from Los Alamos
for nearly three years.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lee was fired on March 8, he has not been charged with
any crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Wen Ho Lee is a loyal American, and has always fully
cooperated with the government's investigation,'' the statement
said. ``He has submitted to four interviews with government
representatives regarding his activities during this period and
continues to cooperate with the U.S. attorney's office for the
district of New Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   The six-page statement provides new details about the
relationship between the FBI and the Lees.
</P>
<P>
   Lee first came to the FBI's attention in 1982, after he
telephoned a scientist who had been fired from Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory in California and who was under suspicion of
giving China neutron bomb secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The phone call was intercepted by the FBI, prompting an
investigation and a polygraph of Lee. Lee proved deceptive on the
first polygraph, conducted in 1984, but was given a chance by the
FBI to retake the test and passed the second time.
</P>
<P>
   Holscher's statement said Lee then agreed to an FBI request to
fly to Lawrence Livermore to meet with the scientist as part of
that investigation, code-named ``Tiger Trap'' by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Lee received instructions from the FBI before the meeting,
met with the scientist and then briefed the FBI after this
meeting,'' Holscher's statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Lee, Lee's wife and formerly a secretary at Los Alamos,
also provided information to the FBI. She told the FBI about
Chinese scientists visiting Los Alamos, and traveled to China with
her husband in 1986 at the FBI's request, obtaining background
information on Chinese scientists for the bureau, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In helping the FBI, Mrs. Lee put herself and her husband at
risk, with no possible benefit to herself or her husband,''
Holscher wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He also stated that ``it simply defies logic for critics to now
allege that Dr. Lee was engaged in improper activities in mainland
China while he and his wife were there.''
</P>
<P>
   After a 1988 trip to China with her husband, Mrs. Lee wrote a
report for the FBI, and allowed an FBI agent to monitor her
communications with Chinese scientists in her role as Los Alamos'
liaison with Chinese visitors, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Holscher also disputed reports concerning assertions that Lee
improperly transferred huge amounts of secret nuclear weapons data
from a classified computer into an unclassified system. Officials
have said that those files were then accessed by someone from the
unclassified system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Press reports incorrectly state that Dr. Lee mishandled his
Los Alamos Laboratory computer files,'' Holscher wrote. ``Dr. Lee
has never given classified computer files to any unauthorized
person. In fact, Dr. Lee took substantial steps to protect his
computer files, and we are confident that federal investigators
will also conclude that no third party could have or did access his
protected files.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee and his wife plan to continue to live in New Mexico near the
lab where they once worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Lee will not be a scapegoat for alleged security problems
at our country's nuclear laboratories,'' the statement said. ``Nor
should he be used to further the political agendas of those who are
illegally leaking confidential information concerning the details
of the government's investigation.''

 &HT;    Teen faces life in prison for bus-stop beating
 &HT;    By Mark Bixler
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A high school sophomore from Cherokee County was
convicted of felony murder and other charges Friday evening in the
bus-stop beating of a 13-year-old neighbor seven months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Miller, 15, sat stone-faced when the jury foreman stood
up and announced the convictions. He showed no emotion until one of
his lawyers clasped his shoulder, looked him in the eye and said
something to try to comfort him. He began to cry just before a
sheriff's deputy led him away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love you, Jon!'' a relative said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love you, too!'' he said through tears.
</P>
<P>
   The conviction brings an automatic life sentence in prison. He
would be eligible for parole 14 years into the life sentence under
current guidelines, but Superior Court Judge C. Michael Roach also
must impose a sentence for Miller's convictions on charges of
aggravated battery and aggravated assault, felonies that each carry
a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. A formal sentencing date
has not been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was convicted in the Nov. 2 beating of Josh Belluardo, an
eighth-grader who was hit in the back of the head after he stepped
off his school bus at the end of a six-house cul-de-sac where he
and Miller lived. The blow caused a microscopic tear in an artery
at the base of Josh's skull, but the cut was big enough to let
blood seep onto his brain. He fell to the ground and was brain-dead
within 60 seconds, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   Josh lingered in a coma for two days before his family made the
agonizing decision to take him off life support. A medical examiner
testified that it is ``exceedingly unusual'' for a single blow to
the back of the head to kill someone.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses described Miller as a bully, and the killing led state
lawmakers to pass an anti-bullying law that was signed by Gov. Roy
Barnes about two weeks ago. Friends of Miller's family said he was
a typical 15-year-old who was trying to become an Eagle Scout.
</P>
<P>
   After six hours of deliberations, jurors filed into the
courtroom at 6:35 p.m. to announce their verdict. Miller's mother,
Robin Miller, began to cry. She rested her head on the shoulder of
her other teen-age son as Roach asked each of the seven men and
five women of the jury to stand up and verify their verdict.
</P>
<P>
   On the opposite end of the same wooden bench, Josh's mother,
Vickie Belluardo, leaned into her husband, John, and cried quietly.
Moments later, they passed a bank of television cameras and
reporters outside the courtroom. They declined to talk with
reporters, but their pastor, the Rev. Scott Miller, said they were
relieved that the trial had ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad day,'' he said. ``We're glad this day is over and
just hope everybody keeps us in our prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurors also declined to comment following the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Harvey, one of three attorneys who represented Miller,
said he plans to appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a very sad state of affairs when a 15-year-old
boy is charged'' after what otherwise would have been a relatively
minor confrontation between teen-agers, Harvey said. He admitted
during the three-day trial that Miller hit Josh from behind but
said his actions do not justify a sentence of life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will come out a lot worse than he came in,'' Harvey said.
``Society will have made him into something else.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the killing of 15 people at a high school in suburban
Denver last month and the rash of copycat threats of violence
across the United States created a climate that deprived Miller of
a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Miller has been unusual from the start, and it
took another twist Friday afternoon when word of an approaching
tornado sent jurors to the ground level of the Cherokee County
Courthouse. They continued deliberations as warning sirens wailed
outside.
</P>
<P>
   In closing arguments Friday morning, prosecutor Rachelle
Carnesale urged the jury to pay attention to evidence. She said the
evidence proved that Miller taunted Josh on the bus and then rushed
him front behind and ``smashed'' Josh in the back of the head.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to send a message with your verdict in this
case,'' she said. ``You need to think about what you're telling the
children of this community with this verdict.''
</P>
<P>
   When Carnesale described the attack that left Josh gasping for
air, face-down in the grass of a neighbor's yard, Josh's mother put
her arm around her daughter. Robin Miller dabbed her eye with a
tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an ambush. It is an attack,'' the prosecutor said.
``It was planned out loud and executed in front of a bus load of
witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   She told jurors to dismiss any sympathy they might have for
Miller because he is 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``He meant to hurt Josh, to beat the hell out of him,''
Carnesale said.
</P>
<P>
   Then she turned toward Miller and glared at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Mr. Miller, I guess you did beat the hell out of him,
didn't you?''
</P>
<P>
   David Wolfe, another of Miller's attorneys, argued that the
attack justified a misdemeanor charge of assault, battery or
reckless conduct. State law says someone who commits a misdemeanor
that leads to a death is guilty of involuntary manslaughter,
punishable by one to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was convicted under the state's felony-murder law, which
says that someone who commits a felony that causes a death can be
found guilty of murder. It does not matter whether that person
intended to kill anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe told jurors that prosecutors failed to prove that Miller
acted with the intent to commit ``serious bodily injury.'' They
must do that to support an aggravated battery charge. He also said
the state did not prove that Miller used his fists as ``a deadly
weapon,'' which they had to do to support the aggravated assault
charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is Jonathan Miller is not guilty of felony murder''
because ``he's not guilty of aggravated battery and he's not guilty
of aggravated assault,'' Wolfe said. ``He's guilty of involuntary
manslaughter because, unfortunately, Josh died.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnesale clashed several times with Wolfe and Harvey during the
trial, which began Wednesday morning after more than six days of
jury selection. Defense attorneys raised nine objections during
Carnesale's 50-minute closing argument Friday. Carnesale asked
Superior Court Judge C. Michael Roach to ``rebuke'' Harvey and
order him to ``keep his mouth closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys said they objected because Carnesale made
improper arguments and tried to play on jurors' sympathy for Josh.
</P>
<P>
   Carnesale also tried to equate the tactics of the defense team
with that of their client. She told jurors that Miller's three
attorneys and two jury consultants had tried to ``sucker punch''
the jury by trying to get them to focus on Miller's youth and
otherwise trying to divert attention from the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that you reap what you sow,'' she said. ``It's time
for Mr. Miller to reap the whirlwind.''

MILOSEVIC AIDE IN KOSOVO SAYS HE IS TRYING TO RECONCILE ALL ETHNIC
GROUPS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Last September, Zoran Andjelkovic, the
Serb minister for youth and sport, was assigned the unenviable task
of trying to run Kosovo as it slid faster and faster toward civil
war.
</P>
<P>
   A bluff and friendly man, Andjelkovic says he's doing his best
to hold Kosovo together and to promote reconciliation among all the
Serb province's ethnic groups. In a long interview Friday in the
undamaged part of Pristina's government building, which was hit by
NATO missiles a month ago, Andjelkovic described his efforts to get
aid to those who need it and to encourage ethnic Albanians who have
fled to return home.
</P>
<P>
   He is president of the Temporary Executive Council of the
Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija (the province's full
name). But Andjelkovic knows that any political settlement will
mean his replacement once new elections can be held. He may be gone
much sooner, as the Yugoslav government, working on an internal
solution to Kosovo, tries to cobble together a new temporary
executive with a moderate Albanian as its head.
</P>
<P>
   While real power is out of his hands, Andjelkovic, who belongs
to President Slobodan Milosevic's party, is trying to put the best
face on the situation in Kosovo. He is working to find gasoline for
farmers who need it to sow and plow, and to find flour for the
bakeries and transport to get the loaves to people. Each day now,
100,000 loaves are being sold in Pristina, he said, the best
evidence that people are returning here to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud that we have managed to stabilize the situation and
put the police back in control,'' he said. It was NATO's bombing
campaign, which began March 24, and the simultaneous effort of
Kosovo Liberation Army secessionists to begin an uprising, he
insisted, that set Kosovo's population to flight.
</P>
<P>
   The first 10 days or so of chaos included fierce clashes among
angry civilians, Andjelkovic said, much as he had warned Western
officials would happen if the bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   But he also has his own special take on events. The chaos was
further manipulated by ``multiethnic criminal gangs'' dressed in
stolen or purchased army and police uniforms, Andjelkovic said. It
was these gangs of Serbs, Turks and Albanians, he insisted, not
regular Yugoslav army forces or any Serb paramilitaries, who went
door to door threatening Albanians and ordering them to leave, in
order to rob their apartments at will.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, he said, there was no organized ``ethnic cleansing''
_ just organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not claiming there were no threats from Serbs,'' he said,
when pressed. ``But no one left Kosovo before March 24, when the
bombing started, and I insist on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the evidence of thousands of burned houses and shops
of Albanians all over Kosovo, Andjelkovic said: ``When the houses
are empty it is an opportunity for the multiethnic criminal gangs.
They rob the houses and burn them. But I'm very proud we could stop
it here and get the situation under control.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 380 people in Kosovo have been arrested for such
crimes, he said, and are being punished with sentences ranging from
five to 20 years by military courts. When told those figures were
two weeks old, he said there would be new ones soon.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, he insisted, the houses could all be rebuilt and
refurnished ``for the price of rebuilding only three of the
bridges'' that NATO has destroyed, let alone all the factories, oil
refineries and warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Albanian accounts in the last few days of uniformed
men coming to the Suncani Breg district of Pristina and ordering
them to get out or else, Andjelkovic said that Yugoslav army
uniforms could be bought for up to $300, and that this aggression,
too, was the work of the ``multiethnic criminal gangs.''
</P>
<P>
   Banging his finger on the table, he said, ``I'm absolutely
convinced that official army and police forces did not do something
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Other senior Yugoslav and Serb officials privately acknowledge
the accuracy of some refugee accounts of Serb paramilitaries'
forcing them to leave Kosovo, following the pattern in Bosnia in
the early 1990s. But they also insist that the army and the police
have moved to rein in the paramilitaries and did not participate in
any organized ethnic cleansing. Their version is that these forces
merely pursued a strategy, as the United States did in Vietnam, of
clearing villages of insurgents and their civilian supporters
before allowing residents to return home.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Albanians, Andjelkovic said sadly, about 30 percent
of them have left the province. That is roughly in line with
estimates from the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, which says that at least 700,000 Albanians have left
Kosovo, out of a prewar total of some 1.8 million, which would be
nearly 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm convinced people will come back,'' he said. ``On the
first day that the bombing stops and a political climate of trust
is restored, they will come back.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his fashion, Andjelkovic is trying to restore that trust. A
number of Albanian Kosovars serve on the temporary executive
council, although, he said, ``I can agree that not enough
representatives of the Albanians were willing to participate before
the war.''
</P>
<P>
   He bemoans the Albanian political strategy of nonparticipation
in Serb-run elections and institutions, including the police, over
the past decade. This was the Gandhi-like policy promoted for years
by the nonviolent Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, who encouraged
Albanians to ignore the ruling Serbs and to create their own
parallel structures. But Rugova's policies did not produce rapid
enough progress toward independence in Kosovo, and he lost
influence to the armed insurgents of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   With the rebels badly hurt by the Yugoslav offensive, Belgrade
has turned to the enigmatic Rugova to try to create an internal
solution that could spell the end to Andjelkovic's difficult
tenure.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he said, he and his Albanian council members
move around the province, urging refugees to return home and trying
to provide food, medicine and fuel to those most in need.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if patriotic Serbs would later be ashamed by events in
Kosovo, Andjelkovic bristled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serbs should be proud of their attitude and behavior toward
Albanians before March 24,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What about after March 24?
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean they should be ashamed of events after March
24, either,'' he said. ``Serbs and Albanians shared the same
situation under the bombs.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Vicente Fox Quesada, the cowboy-boot manufacturer
and former Coca-Cola executive who has become the first
businessman-turned-politician to have a serious shot at the Mexican
presidency, smiles as reporters fire questions at him, some of them
not too friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Why is he obstructing an alliance among opposition parties? Has
he stopped quarreling with a rival politician? Fox fields the
questions patiently, unruffled.
</P>
<P>
   But minutes later, when he sits for an interview in a nearby
cafe, the first query sets him on edge: ``Can you name some
business people who support you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I could give you a list,'' Fox responds, pensively.
``But probably they won't talk to you. In Mexico, anybody who
announces support for the opposition suffers government
reprisals.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox is right about his supporters' desire for privacy. Now the
governor of the state of Guanajuato in central Mexico, he has been
campaigning nationwide for a year for the presidential nomination
of his National Action Party, or PAN, saying that if elected, he
will work closely with entrepreneurs to modernize Mexico's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Political experts say he is attracting more private-sector
support than any other opposition presidential candidate in this
century. Yet few of his business backers are willing to be
identified publicly.
</P>
<P>
   But they are not alone in being skittish about announcing a
presidential choice; so are most of the wealthy entrepreneurs who
are long-time backers of the party in power, the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   That is a dramatic shift in Mexican politics.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI has won every presidential election since it was formed
in 1929. And before every vote during those 70 years, Mexico's
wealthiest entrepreneurs have spoken out in overwhelming numbers in
support of the PRI candidate. But so far this time, neutrality has
become fashionable.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen months before the presidential balloting, all but a
handful of business executives refuse to be identified publicly
with any party; Mexican politics have become too unpredictable.
Despite Mexico's creeping transition toward more effective
democratic institutions, business success here often continues to
hinge on political considerations, like whom you know in government
and which candidate you supported in the last election.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, experts say, many wealthy Mexican businessmen
are hedging their bets, donating money both to Fox and to
politicians who may become the PRI's candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the big money is supporting Fox,'' said Alfonso
Zarate Flores, who edits Carta Politica, a political newsletter
here. ``This time, there's no guarantee of a PRI victory, and
nobody wants to bet exclusively on a party that may not win. On the
other hand, money is pragmatic, and those with money are not going
to take unneeded risk with it. Supporting anybody other than the
PRI is still pretty much done in secret.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's nationwide campaign has helped him forge an early
advantage in opinion polls. He leads Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano,
the mayor of Mexico City, who is the likely candidate of the
leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, or PRD.
</P>
<P>
   He also leads all potential PRI candidates, including the
interior minister, Francisco Labastida Ochoa, who is said to be
President Ernesto Zedillo's preferred choice.
</P>
<P>
   One wild card is the governor of Veracruz, Miguel Aleman
Velasco, whose ties to the PRI elite as the son of a former
president, helped him during a lengthy career as a broadcasting
executive. Were he to become the PRI's candidate, which is far from
certain, he could be expected to attract overwhelming
private-sector support, experts said, because some businessmen
believe he could be even more effective than Fox in controlling
powerful PRI hard-liners who oppose economic initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 elections are likely to provide stark choices for
Mexico's economic and business-related policies. The modernization
program pursued by Zedillo and his predecessor, Carlos Salinas de
Gortari, has stalled, with several privatization initiatives
floundering amid nationalistic opposition, and it is not clear how
vigorously the eventual PRI candidate will champion further change.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Cardenas, who is also the son of a former
president, advocates increased state intervention in the economy;
he vowed recently to renegotiate the North American Free Trade
Agreement. Fox, in contrast, offers policies that are frankly
pro-business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Fox because he's a businessman who became a politician,
which is unusual here,'' said Carlos Rojas, president of AMROP
International, an executive search firm with offices in Mexico City
and Monterrey and one of a handful of Fox's business backers who
have acknowledged their support openly. ``My business doesn't
depend on the government. If it did, I wouldn't talk about
politics.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For decades, many successful businesses in Mexico depended on
executives' cozy, if not downright corrupt, relations with the
state. Successive PRI governments protected Mexican industries with
high tariffs, which from the 1940s through the early 1970s produced
spectacular growth, averaging about 7 percent annually, although
the country's famously low wages remained stagnant.
</P>
<P>
   Construction, broadcasting, real estate and transportation
businesses and other companies with PRI connections amassed
extraordinary fortunes, even under governments that often preached
an anti-capitalist gospel. But executives were expected to leave
politics to the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business people accepted their apolitical role and tolerated
the government's revolutionary and anti-business rhetoric in
exchange for the guarantee of a profitable economic environment,''
wrote Kristin Johnson Ceva in a recently completed Stanford
University doctoral dissertation on Mexico's private sector. ``This
was not an alliance based on ideological principles, but a
pragmatic `Alliance for Profits.'''
</P>
<P>
   After 1970, however, relations between government and business
soured. President Luis Echeverria Alvarez adopted an openly
anti-business posture in the early '70s, and his successor, Jose
Lopez Portillo, nationalized the country's banks in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some entrepreneurs reacted by turning for the first time to
political activism, forming new organizations to protect their
interests, including the Business Coordinating Council, now
Mexico's main private-sector umbrella group.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurs-turned-candidates like Manuel J. Clouthier, a
vegetable exporter who ran for president in 1988, and Ernesto
Ruffo, a fishing-company executive in Baja California who became
Mexico's first opposition governor in 1989, pioneered new political
roles for businessmen. Both ran as members of the PAN.
</P>
<P>
   Partly in reaction to the new business pressure, Presidents
Miguel de la Madrid and Salinas began adopting free-market
policies. Mexico entered the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
in 1986, reversing decades of protectionism.
</P>
<P>
   And after his 1988 inauguration, Salinas sold off state-owned
companies, reduced Mexico's regulatory burden and campaigned for
NAFTA. Since it took effect in 1994, NAFTA has spurred billions of
dollars of U.S. investment in Mexico, especially in manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   NAFTA, along with the peso devaluation and banking crisis that
opened Zedillo's administration in December 1994, also created a
sharp divide in Mexican business.
</P>
<P>
   The largest and wealthiest industrial groups, many of which
focus on exports and have access to foreign capital markets, have
benefited greatly from the treaty and the currency adjustment. Even
so, many of the wealthiest executives are dissatisfied with the
virtual collapse of Mexico's drive toward privatization and other
economic initiatives during the Zedillo administration.
</P>
<P>
   For hundreds of thousands of small and medium-sized businesses,
meanwhile, NAFTA has meant the painful end to protection from
foreign competition. The peso devaluation multiplied their debts,
and subsequent high interest rates cut off entrepreneurs and
consumers from financing, choking the expansion of the fledgling
middle class on which the domestic market had depended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only the multimillionaires with government connections have
prospered,'' said Alejandro Gurza Obregon, who owns the Ford
dealership in Torreon, Coahuila, in northern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Gurza, who says his dealership has been audited repeatedly over
the years because of his opposition views, said he would vote for
Fox ``because he's a brave man, brave enough to try to change
Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Gurza's own dealership is still in the black, but he said some
300 of Mexico's 1,100 auto dealerships had gone bankrupt since
1994.
</P>
<P>
   So, as Mexico's presidential campaign gets under way,
entrepreneurs divide into two broad groups: the heads of large,
prosperous firms, who are impatient in their desire for further
change, and smaller business people, who are impoverished.
</P>
<P>
   Fox wants to galvanize the support of both groups. His own
career has given him roots in the two sides of Mexican capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating with a business degree from Mexico City's
Universidad Iberoamericana in 1964, he went to work for Coca-Cola
de Mexico. Over 15 years, he rose from route supervisor to chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the university, they taught me to reflect and to analyze,''
Fox said in the interview in the Mexico City cafe. ``But working at
Coca-Cola was my second university education. I learned that the
heart of a business is out in the field, not in the office. I
learned strategy, marketing, financial management, optimization of
resources. I learned not to accept anything but winning. I learned
an iron discipline for getting results.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Fox left Coke and moved his family from Mexico City to
the grimy industrial city of Leon in Guanajuato to help his
brothers manage his family's two footwear factories and 1,100-acre
vegetable ranch. During the next eight years, he experienced the
rigors of running a small business in an authoritarian state with a
chaotic economy.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, the Fox brothers used their own lands and
other assets as collateral, taking dollar-denominated loans from
Mexican banks to finance new wells for irrigation and, in 1984, the
construction of a plant to package their frozen broccoli,
cauliflower and other vegetables, Fox's brother Cristobal recalled
in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bad time to be in debt, especially in dollars. During
the presidency of de la Madrid, from 1982 to 1988, the Mexican peso
was devalued repeatedly, from 150 to the dollar to 2,900 to the
dollar. The Fox brothers managed to keep their businesses afloat,
partly because they began earning dollars by exporting their
vegetables. But they watched a dozen other Mexican packers go
bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every micro, small and medium-sized entrepreneur in this
country is a hero for surviving, growing and exporting under these
circumstances,'' Fox said. ``I'm not embarrassed to say the
businesses of the Grupo Fox are still highly leveraged, because
that's the situation of all Mexican businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Fox and dozens of other beleaguered Mexican
entrepreneurs from regions north of Mexico City ran for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Fox announced his candidacy, government health
inspectors temporarily shut down the family packing plant because
employees lacked photo identification cards. Later, Social Security
officials audited the plant's books.
</P>
<P>
   Peasants _ stirred up by the PRI, Fox says _ invaded Fox family
lands, seizing property. (They were eventually evicted after an
agreement with authorities.) ``It was pure political harassment,''
Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the distractions, Fox was elected to Congress. He served
one term and then ran for governor of Guanajuato in 1991, losing an
election that was marred by fraud. He ran for governor again in
1995 and won a sweeping victory.
</P>
<P>
   Two years into his governorship, he started his bid for the
PAN's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   He campaigns as a plain-talking, no-nonsense populist; some in
the PRI see him as a kind of Mexican Ross Perot, though he lacks
the Texas businessman's eccentricities. He promises political
change after 70 years of PRI rule, but his pro-business ideas are
central to his vision of a Fox administration: ``The private sector
will be completely integrated into the task of governing,'' he
said. ``There's going to be an intense, very intense relationship
with the country's entire productive sector, an absolute commitment
to serve and support entrepreneurs, shoulder to shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox doodled on a napkin as he outlined his economic ideas, which
closely resemble the broad programs drawn up by Mexico's main
business organizations.
</P>
<P>
   He promises a disciplined, orthodox economic program aimed at
eliminating fiscal deficits within three years, maintaining a
healthy trade balance and lowering Mexico's annual inflation rate,
which was 18.7 percent last year, to the level of the United States
economy, now less than 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He also pledges to maintain a stable currency, saying he is
``studying'' proposals to link the peso to the dollar through a
currency board system like Argentina's, under which every peso in
circulation is backed by an American dollar in reserve. He is
opposed to abandoning the peso as the national currency.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Fox promises to share federal resources equitably with
states, to prompt regional development and to increase greatly
government spending on education.
</P>
<P>
   In a special effort to attract the support of small-business
people who have been cut off from credit by Mexican banks, Fox
promises ``reconstruction of the national financial system,'' so
that it can offer credit at reasonable interest rates to ``100
percent of Mexicans.''
</P>
<P>
   But he offers special treatment for Mexico's wealthiest
executives, too. There will be no vendetta, he says, against the
robber barons who have grown wealthy through corrupt ties to PRI
governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be strict in enforcing the law, and we won't
permit a single new dishonest act,'' he said. ``But every
democratic transition requires that a country look to the future.
The transition in Chile allowed Pinochet to stay. In Spain, those
who were with Franco's dictatorship were allowed to stay. We're not
going to waste time and energy pursuing vengeance for the
corruption of the past in some endless witch hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a year, about 40 of Mexico's richest entrepreneurs, members
of an invitation-only business group, the Mexican Council of
Businessmen, meet for a televised breakfast with the president at
the Mexican White House. Usually they ballyhoo their investment
plans and applaud politely as the president delivers an economic
pep talk.
</P>
<P>
   But this year's event was different. When it was his turn to
speak, Eugenio Clariond Reyes Retana, the president of Grupo IMSA,
an auto battery conglomerate and the council's current president,
delivered a blunt lecture to Zedillo about the virtues of linking
the peso to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Clariond's speech would have seemed routine. But in
Mexico, presidents have always enjoyed kinglike powers. They are
given applause, not advice, at least in public. Zedillo sat
stone-faced through Clariond's address, then rose to deliver a
defensive explanation of his administration's free-floating
exchange-rate policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at the president's face and it seemed to say, `That
wasn't to be today's theme,''' Clariond told reporters after the
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Some political analysts speculated later that Clariond's
extraordinary breach of protocol was a signal that he had joined
the PAN. He denied that in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a priista,'' Clariond said, using a familiar
term for members of the PRI. ``Despite all its errors, the PRI
still backs many concepts that will do the most to bring Mexico's
long-term development.''
</P>
<P>
   But the incident exemplified the increasingly independent path
taken by the men who have been the PRI's most generous backers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest businessmen are losing their patience with the
slow pace of reform,'' said Rogelio Ramirez de la O, who runs a
Mexico City consulting firm called Economic Analysis for Company
Planning. ``The economy needs more deregulation, more
privatization, more reform than Zedillo has been able to deliver.
These men are saying, `What's wrong, why are we being stalled?' And
that's why they're hedging their bets with Fox.''
</P>
<P>
   No member of Clariond's council has publicly expressed support
for Fox, but political affiliations are nonetheless in flux. The
clearest sign has come in several statements of neutrality from men
long identified with the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Carlos Slim, the billionaire who presided over the
privatization of Telmex, the Mexican telephone company, and is
chairman of Grupo Carso, demonstrated his loyalty to the PRI before
the last presidential election by participating in a now-legendary
fund-raising banquet in which 30 magnates committed themselves to
donating $750 million.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Slim was asked if he supported any presidential
candidate. ``No, no, not me; I don't get involved in politics,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entrepreneur has to function in the nation, with the
nation, and for the nation, not with the candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Another dramatic shift occurred recently in the family that
controls Televisa, the broadcasting conglomerate. During his three
decades of control, Emilio Azcarraga Milmo, the founder, offered
unconditional support to PRI candidates and policies on Televisa's
nightly newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   At the same 1993 PRI fund-raiser attended by Slim, Azcarraga
offered a $50 million contribution. But when his son, Emilio
Azcarraga Jean, who took control at his father's death in 1997, was
asked by a Mexican reporter in March if Televisa ``would continue
being a soldier of the PRI,'' he replied, ``Televisa only supports
Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Because political financing laws here are riddled with
loopholes, it is impossible to track how much money Mexico's
richest businessmen may be donating to Fox or other politicians
waging expensive national campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has voluntarily disclosed records showing that thousands of
small donors give him a few pesos each month. But 73 percent of the
$163,000 his main campaign committee reported receiving in March
came from unnamed donors in sums ranging from $2,100 to $53,000,
the records show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting important support from entrepreneurs, people who
want a different Mexico,'' Fox said. But he added: ``Many of these
same businessmen are also probably supporting the PRI.''

KNICKS' SPREWELL AND CAMBY GET READY TO TAKE HEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ The last two New York Knicks in the gymnasium
Friday were Latrell Sprewell and Marcus Camby, both lingering in
the comfort and safety of home like naive freshmen before a week of
hazing.
</P>
<P>
   That was before they would be bumped, banged and baited for 48
minutes. Before they would be prodded and poked at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   There stood the fresh-faced Camby, whose view of the playoffs
had always been via satellite in Toronto. And the enigmatic
Sprewell, whose National Basketball Association playoff experience
had been limited to his Golden State Warriors team being swept in
three games five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Charles Oakley and John Starks _ who have a combined
18 years of playoff experience _ Camby and Sprewell will venture
into the hostile territory of a Knicks-Heat playoff series
beginning with Game 1 of the first-round matchup Saturday afternoon
in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   To the uninitiated, it is impossible to understand the history
of hostility between the two teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll find out real quick,'' Chris Childs said Friday of his
two teammates at the Knicks' practice facility at SUNY-Purchase
just before the team departed for Miami. ``I think they've both had
a full season here in New York, and they know what to expect.
They're both mature men and I think they look forward to the
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   It has already been a challenge for Sprewell and Camby to just
fit into the Knicks' way. More was expected out of the two players
when they were acquired before the season. They were supposed to
push the Knicks ahead of Indiana and Miami in the East and bring a
dash of color to the Knicks' bland style.
</P>
<P>
   But the Knicks wound up scraping for the eighth and final
playoff seeding, while Miami finished No. 1 in the East. But this
is no ordinary first-round pairing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a ride,'' Childs said. ``I'm going to enjoy
it. People have said it's going to be a boxing match, a rumble in
the jungle. It's hard to play body to body and not get into a
skirmish. But a cool head has to prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Some even think the Knicks can prevail in this series. Although
the Knicks adamantly deny it, many of them privately wanted destiny
to make this matchup. The core players _ including Patrick Ewing,
Larry Johnson and Allan Houston _ have a history of digging up some
of their best efforts against a Heat team they know as well as
their own ATM codes. There are no secrets here.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks know their success begins with shadowing Tim
Hardaway, closing on the Heat's perimeter shooters, walking away
from conflict and luring Alonzo Mourning into foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the Knicks knew they could count on Oakley clearing
a path for Ewing and would have faith that Starks could stop a Heat
run with a 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   Now what? Sprewell and Camby are the unknown quantities in this
series. Sprewell could be electric and inspiring, or he could shoot
2 for 17. Camby could rise up for heroic blocks in a pinch, or he
could become grounded on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   By now, both are used to being looked at with skeptical eyes.
Sprewell unexpectedly found himself as the sixth man and Camby was
left to work through his frustrations with his limited playing time
until he gained the trust of coach Jeff Van Gundy.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the question was being asked: Why did the Knicks trade
for them again?
</P>
<P>
   After hearing what ill fits they were for the Knicks all season,
Camby and Sprewell will have a chance to show they can adapt their
up-tempo habits to the grind-it-out half-court style the playoffs
usually reveal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just focused on what I have to do, not why I was brought
here,'' Sprewell said. ``I know there is a lot of animosity between
the two teams. You have to be aggressive but show poise, too. You
have to know when to back off.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not like Sprewell to back off on the floor. That is not
his background. He is more comfortable running up and down in a
reckless race to the hoop. But in the playoffs, every possession is
critical, every careless mistake on defense is pivotal.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell has been prone to launch quick 3-pointers in transition
and leave his man open on the perimeter for a 3-pointer. But as the
season has progressed, he has become a hair more disciplined in
both areas. Against the Heat, Sprewell will be asked to be more
patient and defend with more courage against a bulkier Jamal
Mashburn in the post.
</P>
<P>
   And if given the chance, a lot will be expected of Camby as
well. Not only will he have to be wary of Hardaway's penetrating
drives to the basket, he will have to shadow P.J. Brown and provide
help on Mourning. Offensively, Camby will try to sneak free and cut
to the basket for the kind of easy dunks he had in Miami two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping Jeff has enough confidence in me to go with me
during the playoffs,'' said Camby, who went from playing zero
minutes against the Heat in the 15th game of the season to 28
minutes with 15 points in the Knicks' wild 20-point comeback April
26. ``If not, I'll be fine. It doesn't matter if I play 5 or 35
minutes; I just want to get in there and have fun and play hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see what happens. From everything I've seen on TV, it's
been an intense and brutal rivalry.''
</P>
<P>
   Television is not reality. Saturday in Miami, that begins the
real test for Camby and Sprewell.

   Sip With a Straw and an Agenda &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Drink my clean water, and help protect yours: Robert F. Kennedy
Jr., long an environmentalist, recently introduced Keeper Springs
mountain spring water. Influenced by Paul Newman's charitable
example, Kennedy pledges the profits to local water conservation
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people think of the environment, they think of global
issues like the ozone layer or the destruction of the rain
forest,'' he said. ``They don't think about their own backyard.''
</P>
<P>
   The water is already available in the New York area and will be
sold nationally next year. The suggested price is 89 cents for a
half-liter and $1.39 for 1.5 liters.
</P>
<P>
   The proceeds will be used to protect water supplies where the
water is bought. Revenues from the Northeastern debut will go to
organizations like Riverkeeper, a conservation group in
Garrison-on-Hudson, N.Y., where Kennedy is a lawyer; the Long
Island Sound Keeper, and the New York Watershed.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy guarantees that Keeper Springs will be bottled in
Saratoga Springs, N.Y., in such a way that fish, especially
spawning fish, are not disturbed. _ DANA CANEDY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Road Not Taken &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Leslie H. Wexner, chairman and chief executive of The Limited
Inc., knows a good deal when he sees one _ and, presumably, a bad
one, too. Last week, his board let him escape from one of the
latter, a deal that could have forced him to sell nearly one-third
of his Limited shares back at $25, half the current market price.
</P>
<P>
   Several Limited shareholders squawked, saying the company was
effectively transferring more than $400 million from their pockets
to Wexner's. Those pockets are already quite stuffed: Wexner's
holding of Limited stock alone is worth more than $2.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy flared when The Limited said last week that it
would buy 15 million shares from the public at $50 to $55 each,
replacing the plan that would have forced Wexner in 2006 to sell
almost a third of his 57 million shares for $25 each.
</P>
<P>
   Why would the company pay $50 now for the public's shares rather
than $25 later for his? Company executives said last week that
there is ``greater immediate tangible benefit'' for all
shareholders in the earlier purchase. Besides, they said, the
company has oodles of excess cash. Apparently that's a problem that
few shareholders _ other than Wexner, perhaps _ understand.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   What John D. Doesn't Tell John Q. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An Orlando, Fla., divorce battle threatens to penetrate the
secrecy surrounding the history, size and substance of the fabled
fortune created by John D. Rockefeller. The case involves George
O'Neill Jr., John D.'s 48-year old great-great-grandson, and Amy
O'Neill, his wife of 10 years, who is 31.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. O'Neill's lawyer wants to make public documents involving
four trusts that O'Neill's great-grandfather (John D. Rockefeller
Jr.), grandmother and mother set up between 1934 and 1976.
O'Neill's lawyers are fiercely campaigning to keep the files
closed.
</P>
<P>
   The last time even sketchy information about the trusts became
public was when Nelson A. Rockefeller became vice president in
1974.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Charles Prather's deadline for a disclosure agreement came
and went on Thursday, but as of late Friday he was considered
almost certain to grant the lawyers' request for a one-week
extension. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ROBERT D. HERSHEY JR. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Do Those Coughs Sound Familiar? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So that's why the new Nancy Lee and Perry R. Bass Performance
Hall in Fort Worth looks so much like New York's Carnegie Hall,
horseshoe-shaped tiers and all. There, in a first-tier Carnegie
Hall box on a recent Sunday afternoon, sat Sid R. Bass, Perry's
oldest son, and his wife, Mercedes, for one of the Metropolitan
Opera Orchestra's sold-out concerts under James Levine.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out that Sid and Mercedes Bass, living in Fort Worth and
New York, are among Carnegie Hall's largest donors, with Mrs. Bass
serving on the board. Mercedes, in particular, was a
behind-the-scenes adviser on the design of the Fort Worth hall,
carried out by the architect David M. Schwarz and overseen by
Edward P. Bass, another Bass brother.
</P>
<P>
   Sid Bass, who can be impatient for people to get to the point,
listened to a Mozart symphony and then scooted out of his box
before the Mahler that followed. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It Wasn't All About Winning &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The recent passing, at age 80, of Jerold C. Hoffberger, a
Baltimore businessman who once owned the Orioles, recalls a time
when some sports-team owners had loftier goals than building the
most luxurious sky boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Melvin Tuggle, president of Clergy United for the
Renewal of East Baltimore, said in an interview that Hoffberger
brought Frank Robinson to the team in 1966 in part to break down
the city's racial barriers. ``He believed sports could do that,''
Tuggle said.
</P>
<P>
   When Robinson led the Orioles later that year to their first
World Series win, Mayor Theodore McKeldin ask for the repeal of the
local Jim Crow laws. He called it a ``distasteful irony'' that the
man who brought home the pennant couldn't enter a bar in downtown
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffberger sold the team in 1979 but tried to buy it back in
1988 with a syndicate with investors who would have been the
league's first black majority owners. The bid was rejected. &QL;

   MUSIC-CONTRACTS (Undated) _ A slew of recent events _ from the
panic at major labels over the distribution of music on the
Internet to the blood-letting following large music company mergers
_ has made it clear to musicians that the structure of major record
companies is not conducive to either their financial or, more
important, their artistic goals. Talking to everyone from
up-and-coming bands to those who have been signed for more than a
decade, from artists with low sales to superstars, from lawyers to
former executives, there is a growing dissatisfaction with a system
that has been building its fortress for more than 100 years _ since
a company called Columbia sprung up to challenge Thomas Edison's
exclusive distribution of prerecorded cylinders to be played on the

   THREE-SEASONS-FILM (Undated) _ The Vietnamese film by Tony Bui,
``Three Seasons,'' opened in New York on April 30 and will open
nationwide on Friday. It is the first American feature film to
attempt a portrait of contemporary postwar Vietnam, poised on the
brink of modernity. ``Three Seasons,'' which landed a major
American star, (Harvey Keitel who has been known to be partial to
small, independent films), is an interweaving of three stories and
operates on several narrative levels: past and present, personal
and national, realistic and poetic. By Laura Winters. (Moved).

   ELIZABETH-FRANZ-THEATER (New York) _ Some people say there has
never been a Linda like that of Elizabeth Franz as Willy Loman's
wife in ``Death of a Salesman.'' The play's author is one of them.
Speaking of the actress's portrayal in the 50th-anniversary
production now on Broadway, Arthur Miller said, ``She has
discovered in the role the basic underlying powerful
protectiveness, which comes out as fury, and that in the past, in
every performance I know of, was simply washed out.'' By Dinitia
Smith. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   ANNIE-REVIVAL-THEATER (subslug) (Undated) _ The story creaks,
the characters are stereotypes from another time, the theatrical
style doesn't work on modern audiences, but oh, that music. It is
as fresh as on the day it was born. Surely we're talking about ``La
Sonnambula'' or one of its bel canto opera pals, but what about
``Annie Get Your Gun,'' a musical pulled forcibly from the past and
now running strong at the Marquis Theater on Broadway? Vincenzo
Bellini and Irving Berlin have more things in common than you

   MONTE-CARLO-BALLET (Undated) _ With its Mediterranean vistas and
posh casinos, the little principality of Monaco has reigned for
generations as a playground for the rich and famous. It's not all
fun and games, though, for Les Ballets de Monte Carlo, a local
troupe that spent 48 weeks rehearsing and performing last year. Led
by Jean-Christophe Maillot, an amiable young Frenchman with big
ambitions, this 14-year-old company is striving to reconcile its
loyalty to tradition with a passion for something new. It seems
fitting that the company will take up this theme when it opens a
weeklong season at City Center in Manhattan on Wednesday. By

   BEBE-MILLER-DANCE (New York) _ The choreographer Bebe Miller,
wearing baggy black pants and a simple black shirt, took a position
in front of the wall-length mirror. A compact woman with
dreadlocks, she faced front, then side, then back, and front again,
allowing herself to be scrutinized. Over a tape recording came her
mellow voice. ``Who is looking for gay men in the group?'' The
questions are aimed at her audiences. ``Who is counting the white
people?'' ``How important is it that these dancers work for a black
choreographer?'' The dancers remained lost in their own worlds
until a gentle rap by the Fugees started up. They then fell into
loose, silky movements. ``This section represents a party,'' Ms.
Miller reminded them. ``Don't be so serious.'' But this 60-minute
piece, ``Going to the Wall,'' which premiered at Dartmouth College
last year, is very serious. It will have its New York premiere on
Tuesday at the Joyce Theater, beginning a weeklong engagement, its

   KOUSSEVITZKY-MUSIC (Undated) _ At a time when the New York
Philharmonic celebrates George Gershwin one season and Aaron
Copland the next, it is easy to forget that the groundbreaking
music of American composers once went unheard in concert halls.
Indeed, such scores were ultimately absorbed into the canon largely
through the efforts of one man, Serge Koussevitzky, the first major
maestro to make ``modern'' American music a priority. A double-bass
virtuoso born in Russia, Koussevitzky led the Boston Symphony
Orchestra from 1924 to 1949 and blazed a trail for innovative
American music by not only performing new scores but also

centers too heavily on that northern region (and especially on the
late 60s Tropicalia movement), it doesn't change the fact that
``Ensaio Geral,'' a 12-CD set of early work by Gil, is an

   HUNGARY-PHOTOGRAPHERS (Undated) _ At the turn of the century,
Hungary was the most photo-obsessed country in the world. Princes
and princesses of the Austro-Hungarian Empire frequented photo
exhibitions and proudly displayed their own prints. From a nation
the size of Indiana emerged many of the leading names of modern
photography, including Andre Kertesz, Brassai, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy
and Robert Capa. But four decades of Communist rule isolated
Hungarian photography from this artistic heritage, from the outside
world and from many of its subjects. Now, at the turn of a new

designer, did not just buy a handful of pieces to use as design
accents; she filled her home with his work. Installing Nakashima
tables, chairs, cabinets, bedroom sets and more, she created a
total environment out of his elegant wood furniture, notable for
their angular bases topped with primitive slabs of wood displaying
grain patterns and naturally craggy edges. Last Sunday, the entire
collection _ save for the first stool Ms. Fiore bought _ was sold

AMONG THOSE TORNADO SURVIVORS ARE THANKING: THE INSURANCE COMPANY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By MILES MOFFEIT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ Snapping photos of her tornado-ravaged home on
Friday, Moore resident Kay Harrell tried to recall all the generous
folks who had come to her aid since she emerged from a neighbor's
cellar squinting at the devastation of Monday's tornado.
</P>
<P>
   There were the neighborhood church workers who staged prayer
services at her curb; there were her husband's co-workers, who gave
them shelter; there was the friend who gave her the only clothes
she has _ the jeans she's worn four consecutive days. ``I can't
even remember who gave them to me.''
</P>
<P>
   And her insurance company, State Farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response of those people has just been wonderful. They've
cut us checks already. They had a generous check the very next
day.''
</P>
<P>
   For Harrell and hundreds of residents in the Oklahoma City area,
the catastrophe action squads sent by insurance companies were
among the first people at the scene comforting them. Instead of
bringing emotionally draining paperwork, they came with soothing
words and filled out checks on the spot. Many said the insurance
people were their first symbols of recovery.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the day after the twisters struck, more than 1,000
insurance agents began pouring into neighborhoods on foot and in
cars. Most skirted the usual red tape to offer advances on claim
payments and advice in starting the repair process.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency checks ranged from $1,000 to $30,000 to help with
food, fix-ups and temporary shelter. Some people had lost
everything, including identification papers, but still were cut
checks if they could simply provide their name and address for
database checks.
</P>
<P>
   Many agents spent hours simply comforting their customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're being extremely sensitive. Some of these people have
lost their mother's china or a wedding dress. I've said to our
adjusters, If you have to sit there and listen to them all day,
just do it,'' said Joyce Washington, market claims manager for
Allstate Insurance's national catastrophe team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not our intent to have people deal with the real claims
process until they're ready. It's important to deal with them
emotionally first.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance firms are dealing with whopping numbers: State Farm,
Oklahoma's largest property insurer, expects 26,000 homeowners with
more than $100 million in claim losses. Allstate officials say they
hesitate to make any cost predictions right now but expect a huge
claim toll.
</P>
<P>
   Washington and other insurance managers said that because of the
widespread devastation, it will take two to three weeks in many
cases to get adjustors to the homes to begin the formal claim
processing.
</P>
<P>
   State Farm sent 10 mobile claims units to the disaster zone,
including one stationed at the central command center in Moore. The
catastrophe teams zoomed in from locations across the country.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, John Whitaker, a 30-year-old State Farm claims
worker, steered his green Plymouth into dozens of shambled Moore
neighborhoods just west of Interstate 35 and through National Guard
checkpoints, flashing his credentials and scanning porches for
policyholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you State Farm? What about you?'' Whitaker shouted from
his car window at Eastlake Estate residents, many of whom were
using lawn tools to rake blown-off pieces of their homes into
curbside garbage piles.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Whitaker has had more than five years experience
working disasters, he couldn't shake the television images of the
tornado bearing down on Oklahoma City. After it rumbled through, he
raced to get out and help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just got to get to our people; that's the most important
thing right now,'' he said. ``One of the problems we've got is that
there are so many people offering homes to the victims, we're
having trouble finding them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get to the people who have nothing. And even if
they're not with State Farm, we want to hook them up with their own
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Eastlake residents Harold and Laura Case, who hid in a stairwell
closet with their dog and children during the storm's fury, were
among the Eastlake residents whose homes escaped severe damage.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker was waving his checkbook, but the Cases resisted,
saying they wanted the people in more harrowing situations to have
the first crack at the money pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are a lot more people who need this money,''
Laura Case said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Whitaker said he kept running into people who were
refusing the checks so others could be helped first.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are incredible, just incredible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In one house, Whitaker joked with a family whose home sustained
only minor damage. He was escorted around by an 8-year-old and when
he emerged from her room, he shouted: ``Great news! The Beanie
Babies weren't damaged at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore resident Mario Jaramillo, who works at Tinker Air Force
Base, lost his 8-month-old home. On Thursday, he was lugging what
personal possessions he could salvage from the ruins, namely
pictures of his son and furniture, then loading them into the back
of his truck.
</P>
<P>
   He commended Farmers Insurance for responding quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm lucky,'' Jaramillo said. ``No one was hurt, and I had a
lot of help. My spirit is not broken. If I break my spirit, I might
as well get another life.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at Harrell's home, another State Farm representative, Sean
Mounger, tried to soothe her, gently patting her on the shoulder as
she snapped her photos to submit with her insurance claim.
</P>
<P>
   Harrell guessed that her property loss could easily reach
$200,000. The tornado leveled her home and threw her 1994 van 50
yards, where it lies upside down in the middle of a neighbor's
collapsed home.
</P>
<P>
   But she and her husband and stepchildren did escape with their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to rebuild despite all of this, right here,'' she
said. ``We'll never lose our memories. We'll build new memories. We
won't let this evil defeat us.''
</P>
<P>
   Allstate's Washington has managed team responses to several
hurricanes, floods and other disasters, but is continually amazed.
So far, her company has processed 2,500 claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am always humbled by the damage,'' she said. ``I'm always
still challenged by the experience and what nature really does.
It's just so very humbling.''

ONLY THREE STILL MISSING AFTER TORNADO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JACK DOUGLAS JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ The number of missing tornado victims dwindled
to three Friday: a frightened young woman who hid under a bridge
and a British couple who were ``touring America'' in a motor home.
</P>
<P>
   They are the last on a missing persons list that at one point
contained the names of 100 people feared hurt or killed when
tornadoes slammed into residential communities in and around
Oklahoma City on Monday, causing massive destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The others on the list have been found alive, many in emergency
shelters or hospitals or with friends and relatives, Medical
Examiner Fred Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said there is strong hope the last three will be found
safe. But, he said, ``we are quite concerned that those are
legitimately missing people.''
</P>
<P>
   The death toll Friday remained at 41, including three children:
two infant boys, ages 3 weeks and 4 months, and a 6-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is scheduled to visit Oklahoma Saturday to
tour the hardest-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
   At an afternoon news briefing Friday, the Oklahoma Medical
Examiner's Office identified the missing British couple as John and
Barbara Potton, believed to be in their 60s.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said the Pottons ``were touring America in a motor
home.'' They were on Interstate 35 south of Oklahoma City, near the
town of Moore, when a monster tornado struck about 7 p.m. Monday,
tossing about vehicles, flattening homes and killing people.
</P>
<P>
   About 3 p.m. Monday, the Pottons had called relatives in Britain
to say they were in Oklahoma City. They have not been heard from
since, breaking a routine in which they had called home each day
they were on the road, Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gentleman's mother's birthday was Tuesday, and they
(family members) still have not heard from them, which is very
unusual,'' the state medical examiner said.
</P>
<P>
   The third missing person was identified as Tram Bui, 23, of
Seminole, Okla. She and her family were traveling on I-35, also
south of Oklahoma City, when the tornado approached, said Ray
Blakeney, director of operations for the medical examiner's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got out of their car and got underneath an underpass at
the time of the storm. After the storm passed, she could not be
found. She has not been seen since,'' Blakeney said.
</P>
<P>
   He said search efforts were beginning to slow as the number of
missing people drops. But, he said, ``we will certainly not quit
looking until we have zero on the list.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents who lost everything in the tornadoes say they will
bounce back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones that I've talked to, they figure on rebuilding,''
said Clarence Frey, a retired farmer who lost his house in Mulhall,
a town of 200 about 45 miles north of Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   Frey said he and his neighbors do not care that officials
consider their community virtually a total loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who live here really like the little town,'' he said,
standing near the shambles of buildings. ``I love it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Janie Jeffrey said she feels lucky to be alive, and her home is
one of the few still upright in Mulhall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bank's ruined. The churches have taken on big damage. The
grocery store is gone. So is the school,'' Jeffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost a lot, but we're going to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 76 tornadoes touched down in 11 counties, cutting a
path of destruction that could come to more than $1 billion in
losses, officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   The storms destroyed more than 3,700 structures, many of them
homes, and severely damaged 500, according to the Oklahoma
Department of Emergency Management.
</P>
<P>
   To help maintain order and assist victims, 969 guardsmen from
the Oklahoma National Guard and 127 troopers from the state highway
patrol were dispatched to the devastated areas, the emergency
management agency said. &QL;

EDITORIAL: BRITAIN'S QUIET REVOLUTION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, May 8:
</P>
<P>
   In an atmosphere of civility and general good cheer, voters in
Scotland and Wales this week ratified a historic shift in the way
Britain is governed. The Scots voted for their first Parliament
since 1707, the Welsh for their first assembly ever. This decorous
revolution could have important consequences. Beyond its stated aim
of decentralizing authority throughout the United Kingdom, it could
invigorate Britain's politics and even its culture. Beyond that, it
could well provide a useful model for other European governments
that are seeking ways to give restive parts of their own countries
a measure of self-rule short of full independence.
</P>
<P>
   For Prime Minister Tony Blair, who had made self-governance a
major issue in his election campaign, the outcome was largely if
not entirely satisfactory. His Labor Party finished first in both
Scotland and Wales but failed to win outright control in either,
which means it will have to share power in a coalition arrangement.
Labor also suffered unexpected losses to the Conservatives in
municipal elections throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Scottish Nationalist Party, which favors
total independence, finished well short of the expectations it had
when campaigning began in earnest last summer. This outcome
appeared to vindicate Blair's gamble that he could neutralize
Scotland's radical separatists by offering a significant measure of
home rule. Independence was not a significant issue in Wales.
</P>
<P>
   The new Welsh assembly will have important administrative powers
but no authority to make laws. The Scottish Parliament, however,
will be able to write laws governing criminal and civil justice,
housing, health, education, transportation, the environment and
culture. The British Parliament will continue to control defense
and foreign policy, social security and fiscal and monetary policy,
although the Scots will be able to adjust tax rates at the margins.
</P>
<P>
   Blair had more in mind than merely keeping the separatists at
bay. He regards decentralization not only as a useful
administrative device but as a means to encourage different
regional identities. The Scots are fiercely attached to their own
civil institutions, which include a distinctive legal system and
schools and universities with their own curriculums. Scotland is a
proud place. Blair clearly hopes that by providing its citizens
with even greater control over their day-to-day affairs, he can
make it a happier and more productive place.
</P>
<P>
   Some British commentators have suggested that Scottish
devolution could help England as well. An editorial in The
Economist's current issue argues that England has long suffered
from the decline of its provincial cities and the ``unhealthy
concentration of political, cultural and economic power around
London and the South-East.''
</P>
<P>
   It notes approvingly the revival of confidence in cities like
Edinburgh and Cardiff _ a revival it links to the promise of
greater home rule _ and suggests that this could ``provide a model
for the revival of England's once-powerful provincial cities.''
That would suit Blair just fine. His long-range program for
decentralization envisages what will amount to regional governments
in the middle and north of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians in France, Germany, Belgium, Italy and Spain have
also expressed keen interest in this week's British elections. All
are testing their own formulas to accommodate politically or
culturally diverse peoples within their own borders. Perhaps the
British example will provide inspiration.

Up-for-grabs title enhances playoffs
<TEXT>
<P>
   By FRAN BLINEBURY
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   So here are a few of the things we won't have:
</P>
<P>
   Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   So does that make the NBA playoffs better or worse?
</P>
<P>
   Neither, it says here. Just more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe less pretty. Maybe less ethereal. But definitely more fun.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than reading like the script of Titanic, where everybody
knows the ending, the next seven weeks will have us turning the
pages as if reading a potboiler mystery to see how it all comes
out.
</P>
<P>
   Admit it. For all of his wonderful talent, penchant for
flamboyant acts and last-second heroics, as long as Michael Jordan
stayed around, the playoffs always were going to be a Gilligan's
Island marathon, where the rest of the league was a bunch of
castaways stuck in the middle of the ocean without a raft or a
paddle or hope.
</P>
<P>
   Line them up, and he knocked them down like milk bottles at a
carnival booth. Jazz, Sonics, Blazers, Suns and a leftover bunch of
Lakers that was the equivalent of the Pips without Gladys Knight.
</P>
<P>
   That was part of the trouble with the Jordan Dynasty. In all
those years since they started winning championships in 1991, the
Bulls never had a fierce, compelling rival who could test them,
stretch them, push them to the limit.
</P>
<P>
   Questions abound
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls never were forced to a Game 7 in the NBA Finals and
only once _ last season by the Pacers _ in the Eastern Conference
finals. They never had to go through the Bird-Parish-McHale
Celtics, the Magic-Kareem-Worthy Lakers or the Dr.
J-Moses-Toney-Cheeks Sixers.
</P>
<P>
   In the two years when Hakeem Olajuwon was the stuff of which
Dreams are made and the Rockets might have been that
honest-to-goodness challenger, Jordan was off whiffing at
curveballs in baseball's minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Our bad luck. Maybe his good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Jordan is gone, and when the doors to the throne
room are thrown open today, the race will be a crowded
bumper-to-bumper affair straight out of NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be NCAA-style, single-elimination March Madness. But it
likely will provide enough May Mayhem to keep us turning on our TV
sets for a reason other than to see what color overpriced sneakers
Air Jordan is modeling each day.
</P>
<P>
   Can Karl Malone and John Stockton finally drag the Jazz over the
last hurdle to a championship? And if they do, will club owner
Larry Miller get fined for cussing and trash-talking commissioner
David Stern during the trophy presentation?
</P>
<P>
   Can Tim Duncan carry off the Most Valuable Player trophy and a
title in just his second year in the league for the Spurs? And if
he does, will he have to stop along the road to the Finals to
administer the Heimlich maneuver to David Robinson and Sean
Elliott?
</P>
<P>
   Can the Trail Blazers use a deeper-than-Stephen Hawking 12-man
rotation to roll all the way to the top? And if they do, will
mainstream America know any of their names?
</P>
<P>
   Can Shaquille O'Neal at long last live up to the hype and
produce like the most physically dominating center of his time to
carry on the Lakers' tradition of titles? And if he does, will it
be because he stepped on teammate Kobe Bryant like a bug?
</P>
<P>
   Can Scottie Pippen win his seventh championship, Olajuwon his
third and Charles Barkley his first in carrying the Rockets? And if
they do, will they need wheelchairs and portable oxygen bottles to
ride in the victory parade?
</P>
<P>
   East has intrigue, too
</P>
<P>
   Can Reggie Miller sling in enough 3-point bombs from somewhere
outside Terre Haute to lift long-ignored Indiana to a crown? And if
he does, will driven, demanding, unsatisfied coach Larry Bird
promptly rip off his suit jacket at the final buzzer and beat him
at a game of H-O-R-S-E?
</P>
<P>
   Can Alonzo Mourning spit and hiss and snarl a path of glory for
the Heat to follow? And if he does, will Machiavellian coach Pat
Riley claim his persecuted team had to overcome a conspiracy among
the FBI, CIA and Miami Vice?
</P>
<P>
   These will be the all-comers playoffs, where the Sixers and
Bucks make their return after an eight-year absence, where Allen
Iverson will try to take every shot for Philly and George Karl will
take no prisoners in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons are back in, and that means Grant Hill gets another
chance to be the next-great-thing. The Kings are back, and that
means Chris Webber is finally happy, and White Chocolate (Jason
Williams) is everyone's favorite candy. The Knicks are back, and
that means a riot in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   We still like Utah and Indiana in the small-market matchup of
NBC's worst nightmare. But in truth, it's a horse race, a mad
sprint, as easy to figure out as picking numbers in the lottery. No
Bulls. No sure bet.
</P>
<P>
   One more thing we won't have: Slobbering Ahmad Rashad interviews
with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like fun.

EDITORIAL: PAY THE LEGISLATORS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, May 8:
</P>
<P>
   Few New Yorkers are shedding tears for the state Legislature,
whose members have not been paid in more than a month. The
lawmakers have only themselves to blame. In order to get a pay
raise from $57,500 to $79,500 last December, they agreed to have
their paychecks withheld in each new fiscal year until they finally
passed a budget.
</P>
<P>
   The pay freeze, demanded by Gov. George Pataki as the price for
not vetoing the pay raise, has failed to work any magic. The
budget, which is supposed to be passed April 1, is late for the
15th year in a row. But the idea of withholding pay was bad in
principle and should be abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   No one would defend the sorry succession of budget impasses and
delays that have played havoc with state finances and the finances
of local governments dependent on state aid. But withholding the
pay of lawmakers, and not of the governor or any other statewide
elected officials, distorts the balance between the legislative and
executive branches.
</P>
<P>
   In any budgetary standoff the legislators will be under economic
pressure to cave, whereas the governor will not. Even though 14
Assembly Democrats who have challenged the pay freeze in a lawsuit
insist they would never vote for an unpalatable budget in order to
get paid, the whole purpose of the law was to coerce a budget
agreement. It is not acceptable for such pressure to fall unevenly
on the legislators, some of whom may face tight economic
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Democratic-controlled Assembly and
Republican-controlled Senate have passed their own versions of the
budget this year. Democrats favor more spending for education and
health programs than either Pataki or the Republicans in the
Legislature. The impasse is as deep as anyone in Albany can
remember, with some legislators fearing openly that the state might
limp along without a budget for a whole year.
</P>
<P>
   Since the stalemate has as much to do with political advantage
as principle, it is not easy to think of incentives to force a
meeting of the minds. The poisonous atmosphere in Albany in recent
years has aggravated these confrontations, and everyone has been
understandably searching for something, anything, that might force
a compromise. But freezing the lawmakers' pay is not the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Legislature could change the law to require that no
state operations can go forward without an overall budget. They
could tie passage of the budget to the issuing of new debt
obligations, a step that might force legislators to act. They could
take some of the acrimony out of the process by opening it up,
mandating committee hearings and conference committee meetings, or
setting up a nonpartisan panel to make spending and revenue
estimates. These steps would go a long way toward instilling a
sense of responsibility in Albany. Docking legislators' pay is the
wrong way to do it.

 &HT;    Veteran Long extends to bridge Hawks' gaps
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was the 1988-89 season, Miami's first as an NBA
franchise. The rookie Grant Long was in love with the town and with
being an NBA player. He was a guy from Romulus, Mich., who courted
and won over a woman named Nikki by plying her with burgers and
fries from the local Jack in the Box.
</P>
<P>
   He thought for a time he was going to be there forever. ``I fit
in that town,'' he said. But forever lasted six seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Grant Long, 33, won't get fooled again. Now with the Hawks, his
fourth NBA stop, the 11-year veteran knows his role, knows the
business of pro basketball and knows where he is wanted.
</P>
<P>
   He surely is wanted by the Hawks, who are counting on Long
throughout the playoffs beginning tonight at the Georgia Dome with
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where we would have been without Grant this
season,'' Lenny Wilkens said. Maybe he simply doesn't want to think
about it.
</P>
<P>
   This is Long's second term with the Hawks, who shipped him to
the Pistons and brought him back after discovering he had the
qualities they were looking for all the time. The 6-foot-9 forward
isn't even a starter, unless the Hawks are short-handed. In this
abbreviated season, he was the last player added to the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he has become the essential man, the indispensable Hawk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't say that. No one's indispensable,'' Long says. ``The
business doesn't allow that.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, he is right. The Hawks could have played this season
without him. But they would not have won 31 games, maybe not even
25.
</P>
<P>
   The trail that brought Long back to the Hawks included a series
of events that altered the lives and careers of good players. The
team signed Alan Henderson to a $45 million contract because he
beat Christian Laettner out of a job. The irony is that the Hawks
had gotten rid of Long because they had acquired Laettner and
needed Dikembe Mutombo to play alongside him. Now, it was Long's
turn, and it paid off when Henderson missed a dozen games this
season and Long played in all 50, starting 13, averaging 9.8
points.
</P>
<P>
   By conservative count, Long had a major hand in a dozen Hawks
wins, either making the play that turned it around, or hitting the
actual shot or making the defensive stop that clinched it.
</P>
<P>
   Against Charlotte, it was a corner jumper; against Indiana, it
was a steal in one game, two free throws in another. Against
Houston, he started at power forward and produced 20 points and12
rebounds, blocking Scottie Pippen's three-point try late in a close
game.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks have learned they can't afford to be without Long
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's important, very important to us,'' general manager Pete
Babcock says. ``Grant's a vital part of our team.''
</P>
<P>
   From last May, when he walked out of the final year of his
contract in Detroit, until the Hawks signed him Feb. 1, a week
after the lockout ended, Long was in limbo. A five-year Atlanta
resident, he knew he would play somewhere, that two years pining on
the bench in a Pistons uniform had neither robbed him of his skills
nor destroyed his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   To mark time, he watched his wife boldly buy her own business, a
company in Heath Springs, S.C., that manufactures children's
furniture and sells to upscale kids stores. She calls it Blessings.
The deal went through the day before the lockout started.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the idle time, Long allowed his wife to operate the
business. ``I wouldn't dream of interfering, because she knows what
she's doing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nikki Long is a stylish woman, a mother of four, a decorator
originally for her own amusement who later turned her talent into a
profit. And the Longs are a good fashion fit, she in diaphanous
whites, he in the occasional derby hat, tipping it with a cane.
Somehow he carries it off in the locker room. When he comes out
onto the court, his chiseled torso wrapped in Hawks red and white,
there is the sense of a Roman officer going into the field.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Steve Smith, who begged the Hawks to bring back his
teammate of six years _ four in Miami, two in Atlanta, said about
Long's sartorial bent: ``Grant carries it off. But it wouldn't
matter how he dressed, because, when the game starts, you know he's
bringing everything he's got. That's why I said we had to have him.
I was right, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith was right, but not because Long is a great scorer or a
spectacular rebounder. Rather, Long is so mature in his thinking,
so dedicated, that he was voted captain of the Heat all six years
he played there.
</P>
<P>
   Long is proud of that. ``I was on a team with Rony Seikaly, Glen
Rice, and I was the guy they asked, `What do we do next?' I hit the
ground running and got that.''
</P>
<P>
   It came from his senior season at Eastern Michigan, when he
averaged 23 points and 12 rebounds and led his school to its first
NCAA Tournament appearance. It happened because Long understood
that he needed to help make his teammates better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lesson that year,'' he said. ``You can't win
anything without your teammates. And I've learned playing in this
league that, if you don't win a championship, you haven't done
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   In his two otherwise-wasted years in Detroit, when he was nailed
to the bench by coach Doug Collins, he studied under guard Joe
Dumars, who will retire after these playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not comparing abilities when I tell you that Joe did for
me what a guy like Magic (Johnson) did for the Lakers,'' Long said.
``It goes on and on. It's not the numbers the superstars have in
those games but what they give everybody else, what Magic did for
the Lakers or what Larry Bird did for the Celtics. (Dumars) showed
me how to win, what you have to do, the discipline in the offseason
that you must bring to the next season.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Long is back to leading by example, even if he is not on
the court as long as some other Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I understand the sacrifices you have to make _ playing
when you're hurt, playing with intensity _ because if you don't
bring it to the next game and then the next game,'' he said, ``how
are you ever going to reach the championship?
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game, every play, every rebound is important. Someone
wrote that Grant Long plays every game like it's the seventh game
of the championship. And for me, it is.

 &HT;    Here's call to new order
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When last there was a championship not earmarked for
Michael Jordan, the Houston Rockets of the Western Conference
seized it and basked in the glow. The notion that their titles of
1994 and '95 were tainted because Jordan did not play full seasons
was poppycock to them. A ring is a ring is a ring.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in this first year of Jordan's retirement and of the
Chicago Bulls' descent _ and after a post-lockout season shortened
to 50 games per team _ the prize is there for the taking again. And
the sentiment remains the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can put an asterisk on this title if you want,'' New York
Knicks center Patrick Ewing said. ``It's still a championship.
That's all I want. I wanted to beat Michael. But he ain't here now,
so you get it how you get it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the West, the opportunity is especially appetizing, for the
only champion from out there in the last decade, Houston, came when
Jordan was either absent or rusty. Like most years, the teams to
the left of the Mississippi River have the more flashy and
aesthetically pleasing styles, along with the big names.
</P>
<P>
   There are Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant on the talent-rich
Los Angeles Lakers. Karl Malone and John Stockon on seasoned Utah.
Tim Duncan and David Robinson of sizzling San Antonio. Hakeem
Olajuwon, Scottie Pippen and Charles Barkley on the grizzled
Rockets. And there is Portland, with a slew of quality parts.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the season's best three records belong to West
squads. But does any of that translate into a title?
</P>
<P>
   In the East, the thinking is the same as always: The slow-down,
defensive-oriented teams that flourish in a half-court game get
their hands raised at the end. That's what bolsters the hopes of
physical Miami and experienced Indiana and the Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   On either side, the list of contenders is hardly exclusive.
``It's as wide open as it could be,'' Orlando Magic coach Chuck
Daly said.
</P>
<P>
   In the East, only six games separate the top-seeded Heat (33
wins) from the eighth-seeded Knicks (27). ``It's very equal, a lot
of parity from teams 1 through 8,'' Heat coach Pat Riley said. ``I
think anybody can beat anybody if you're not on top of your game.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacers coach Larry Bird said: ``You take five or six teams,
they're so evenly matched, it's scary. It's whoever's playing best
that day is going to win.'' Riley sees one team out West that can
take control, but maybe not this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The changing of the guard is maybe a year away. Maybe next
year, San Antonio could be the team for a long period of time, as
long as Robinson and Duncan stay together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No one's been better than the Spurs, who won 31 of their last 36
games to wrest the league's best record from Portland and Utah.
Duncan's growth into an MVP candidate has been pivotal, but the
influence of free-agent swingman Mario Elie might be the biggest
factor.
</P>
<P>
   Elie brought championship experience from his days with the
Rockets and a toughness that the allegedly soft Spurs needed. ``We
had too much talent to play so passively as we did early in the
season,'' Elie said. And he told the other players just that,
challenging them _ particularly Robinson _ to be more physical and
more tough mentally. They responded.
</P>
<P>
   Another element adding to the unpredictability is that players
on low-seeded teams such as Allen Iverson of Philadelphia and Jason
Kidd of Phoenix have the skills to dominate a short series. And
upstarts Sacramento and Orlando have the talent to be trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the Lakers, who have had the most eventful season
of all. They fired coach Del Harris, signed and shunned Dennis
Rodman, traded Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell to Charlotte for Glen
Rice and dealt with discord between stars O'Neal and Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've put it behind us,'' veteran guard Derek Harper said.
``We have the talent to be a dangerous team.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Barkley of first-round opponent Houston said: ``It
depends which Lakers team shows up. If they have their heads on
straight, we'll have the toughest series of anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody can speak more to the craziness of this NBA season than
Barkley's teammate, Pippen. The former Bull no longer has Jordan at
his side, and his new team, just like all the others, has no clear
path to the championship. So many of them are lacking in one area
or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly feels different this year,'' Pippen said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the season sans Jordan, that's not enough to be
discounted.

HARPER OVERCAME '84 GAFFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ It reads like a chapter from ``Strange But
True Basketball Stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Strange, what happened to Derek Harper in those five seconds.
Strange, how Derek Harper has been able to make us forget his
blunder in the 15 years since.
</P>
<P>
   It happened May 6, 1984, as the Lakers played the Dallas
Mavericks at Reunion Arena in Game 4 of the Western Conference
semifinal series. Harper was a 22-year-old Mavericks rookie.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers had blown an 11-point, fourth-quarter lead and were
tied at 108 after Mavericks center Pat Cummings drove for a layup
and drew a foul by Magic Johnson with 31 seconds left. Cummings
missed the free throw. Now you know more than Harper did at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Kareem Abdul-Jabbar missed a jump shot with :12 on the clock.
The Mavericks' Rolando Blackman rebounded. He threw the ball
upcourt to Dale Ellis. Ellis passed to Harper on the right side at
:05.
</P>
<P>
   Harper dribbled. And dribbled. And dribbled. Around in circles.
Trotting up and back. Smiling all the while.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking the Mavericks were ahead by a point, thinking that all
he had to do was dribble out the clock, thinking that Cummings had
MADE the free throw.
</P>
<P>
   Five seconds was a long time if you were one of 17,007 Dallas
fans, pleading, ``Shoot!'' Or if you were Blackman, screaming,
``Shoot!'' but drowned out by the crowd. Or if you were Mavericks
coach Dick Motta, wishing you could ``go out there and tackle
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The buzzer sounded and Blackman not so gently broke the news to
Harper. He'd dribbled away the upstart Mavericks' chance to tie the
series 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   In overtime, Harper made the first jumper and followed up by
stealing a Michael Cooper pass, but the Lakers scored 10 points in
a row and won 122-115. They wrapped up the series two nights later
at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he had lost his mind,'' Abdul-Jabbar said after the
game.
</P>
<P>
   One writer nominated Harper for the Bonehead Hall of Fame.
Another called it ``the biggest single mistake of the NBA season.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were kinder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mistake made (in) innocence and enthusiasm,'' Motta
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wouldn't have been in the game if it hadn't been for
him,'' Lakers coach Pat Riley said, referring to Harper's 14 points
in Game 4 and his clutch jumpers late in the Mavericks' Game 3
victory.
</P>
<P>
   At the rookie's locker, one Southern California writer grew so
morose in his effort to console Harper, ``eventually Harper was
consoling the writer,'' recalled Mitch Chortkoff, a Lakers beat
writer then.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Rambis played in that 1984 game, and when I asked him about
it Friday, the Lakers coach replied testily, ``Why are you bringing
that up now?''
</P>
<P>
   I'm bringing this up now, as Harper prepares for his first
postseason as a Laker, not because the incident has come to define
his career but precisely because it hasn't. The scatter-brained
rookie has turned into one of the wise old men of the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great ballplayer, he's had a great career and he's been
a great leader for us,'' Rambis said. ``You make mistakes. If you
don't learn from them, then it's a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Harper who called the players-only meeting in Vancouver
after the Lakers' third straight loss on Feb. 24. His ``look at
yourself in the mirror'' speech, the coaching change from Del
Harris to Rambis and the activation of Dennis Rodman preceded a
10-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   It was Harper who called the meeting that stretched to 2{ hours
after the Lakers' third straight loss on April 26. That airing of
the team's conflicts preceded the four-game winning streak the
Lakers will take into Sunday's playoff opener against the Houston
Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contribution he's made is one of stability,'' said Derek
Fisher, the starter at point guard while Harper comes off the
bench. ``Being a professional.''
</P>
<P>
   You'd love to believe the rookie mistake 15 years ago taught
Harper something that made him the man he is today. That would be
stretching the truth for the sake of a good story. Harper doesn't
stretch the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't think so,'' he said, though he does say vaguely
that the experience ``helped me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really think about it,'' Harper said good-naturedly.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that even if he'd taken the shot, there's no
guarantee he'd have made it. Anyway, the Mavericks had a chance to
win in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to rewind,'' Harper said. ``I think the worst
thing you can do in life is go back. You've got to move forward. I
don't think I'd be around now if I'd carried it with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is the most telling thing: Harper said people really
don't mention the incident to him all that often. He has made them
forget it.
</P>
<P>
   Now the clock is running down on Harper again. He's with his
fourth NBA franchise. He's 37. He's never played for a champion,
although he was part of the 1993-94 New York Knicks team that lost
Game 7 of the NBA Finals to the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   He signed with the Lakers during the lockout believing they'd
contend. It hasn't worked out as he expected, but they might be
peaking at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly feel we have a chance to win a championship,'' Harper
said in his voice-of-reason baritone.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an omen: The Rockets come to the Forum with an all-rookie
backcourt. Their names are Michael Dickerson and Cuttino Mobley.
Otherwise known as innocence and enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Check the clock. Maybe it's time for Derek Harper to get one
back.

</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Monday, May 3,
about the hidden psychological problems of violent youths misstated
the affiliation of two experts who studied normal adolescents. The
researchers, Dr. Daniel Offer and Dr. Kenneth Howard, work at
Northwestern University, not the University of Chicago.

<P>
   BC-SCI-LYMPH-NODES-NYT (moved on Monday, Apr. 19)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Monday, Apr. 19,
about a procedure to detect the spread of breast cancer misstated
the role of a dye and a radioactive isotope injected near the
tumor. They are used to identify the lymph nodes that should be
analyzed for cancer through a biopsy; the materials do not
themselves indicate whether the nodes are cancerous.
</P>
<P>
   The article also referred incorrectly to a major earlier advance
cited by Dr. Patrick Borgen as comparable in importance. It was
development of the lumpectomy, not breast reconstruction, as a
replacement for mastectomy.

WITH BULLS SPLINTERED, THERE'S AN OPEN ROAD TO THE NBA TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Further proof that one man's garbage is another man's gemstone,
this weekend 16 teams begin a seven-week playoff scramble to pick
up what Jerry Krause threw out _ the NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past we were all playing for the silver medal because
of Michael \RJordan\S and the Bulls,'' Atlanta Hawks guard Steve
Smith said. ``With them gone, I think a lot of teams can smell a
championship, and it's making us all hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   Krause, the Bulls' vice president of operations, broke up the
team and voluntarily surrendered Chicago's NBA title stranglehold.
Because of that, plus the absence of the game's greatest player and
the lockout-induced irregular season that saw plodding play and
record-low scoring, critics say this season's champion will be
asterisked, if not altogether tainted. The participants, however,
promise one of the most fiercely competitive, exciting and
unpredictable postseasons in league history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if there is an asterisk on the trophy,'' Utah Jazz owner
Larry Miller said, ``I promise it won't bother me if we finally win
it.''
</P>
<P>
   While the top-seeded San Antonio Spurs ride the Twin Tower power
of Tim Duncan and David Robinson in the West and the favored Miami
Heat count on Alonzo Mourning's inside presence and Tim Hardaway's
timely shooting in the East, every playoff team needs something
``One-derful'' _ the spectacular Jordan-like performance of one
player carrying his team to win a game, a series, or even a
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where stars are born,'' Indiana Pacers guard Reggie
Miller said. ``Think of Michael's greatest moments, and most of
them were in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   All 16 teams have a go-to guy, from Kevin Garnett's versatility
in Minnesota, to Steve Smith's streaky scoring in Atlanta to Jason
Kidd's triple-doubles in Phoenix. The New York Knicks' Latrell
Sprewell, Milwaukee's Glenn Robinson, Orlando's Anfernee Hardaway
and Portland's Isaiah Rider have the potential to win a game with a
35-point outburst, but likely couldn't sustain the production
throughout a series. Los Angeles Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal
can't make clutch free throws, Houston's Hakeem Olajuwon is too
eager to pass out of passive double-teams, Detroit's Grant Hill is
often too unselfish and Sacramento's Chris Webber often too
disinterested to keep the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of players seem to have the talent and
temperament to single-handedly take their teams to the title.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the group is Philadelphia 76ers guard Allen Iverson, the
league's scoring champion and the most baffling player to stop
one-on-one. At only 6-foot, he combines an eye-blink crossover
dribble, unlimited shooting range, the courage to drive into the
lane and the creativity to get off a variety of shots against
taller defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a one-on-one tournament, my money would be on
him,'' teammate Matt Geiger said. ``I face him every day in
practice and I think I've blocked his shot maybe three times. He
can get off any shot he wants from almost anywhere on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   With the ability to pour in 40 points every night _ and a
conscience to shoot enough to score that much _ but an
average-at-best supporting cast, it's unlikely Iverson can lead the
76ers to the title. The same can't be said for Duncan, who has
pushed Robinson aside, himself into MVP consideration and his team
into the favorite's role with a dizzying array of low-post moves,
soft hands and a demeanor that belies his 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're seeing a changing of the guard,'' Pacers coach
Larry Bird said of Duncan. ``In a couple of years, he'll be by far
the dominant player in this league. We'd all better beat him while
we still can.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Duncan has emerged on the scene, Miami's Alonzo
Mourning, Indiana's Miller and Utah's Karl Malone have always been
there. In the Jazz's intricate half-court sets, Malone uses his
muscle to forge ideal position, then a variety of power layups,
step-back jumpers, left-hand baby hooks and numerous free-throw
attempts to top 30 points consistently.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, meanwhile, is still the league's most feared clutch
shooter and a deadly free-throw shooter in crunch time. If the
Pacers are ahead or behind by three points or less in the final
minute, it's guaranteed Miller will have the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times you just cross your fingers and hope he
misses,'' Magic coach Chuck Daly said. ``Because you know he's
going to find a way to get off a good shot. He's just got the knack
for drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourning's game is more about termination than theatrics. His
relentless effort on defense has made him an legitimate MVP
candidate, while his ability to make intimidating dunks is second
only to O'Neal. His 10 rebounds and five blocks a night are a
given; his 20 points almost icing on Miami's cake.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's no-nonsense,'' teammate Tim Hardaway said. ``When we need
a big bucket there's no question we look to 'Zo.''  &LR; tagtop:Richie
Whitt, (817) 390-7760  &LR; tagbottom:richie &LR; star-telegram.com
Douglas C. Pizac An array of jump shots and power moves to the
basket make the Jazz's Karl Malone one of the league's top scorers.
Michael Conroy When a game is on the line, Reggie Miller, right, of
the Pacers is considered the league's Mr. Clutch.
Mark J. Terrill The sheer power and dunking ability of Shaquille
O'Neal and a strong supporting cast make the Lakers one of the
playoff favorites.

JUDGE DECLARES MISTRIAL IN STARR'S CASE AGAINST STEELE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark.)   (rk) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. _ After jury members twice described themselves
as ``hopelessly deadlocked,'' a federal judge declared a mistrial
Friday in the obstruction of justice trial of Julie Hiatt Steele,
the Richmond, Va., woman who played a peripheral role in Kenneth
Starr's investigation of President Clinton. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The mistrial represents the second setback in a month to Starr's
office. In April, a jury in Little Rock, Ark., acquitted Susan
McDougal of one count of obstructing justice when she refused to
testify before a grand jury about the Clintons' Arkansas financial
dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ms. McDougal, Ms. Steele had attacked the motives and
tactics of Starr's prosecutors. The mistrial appeared to startle
members of the prosecution team, who seemed confident after the
defense abruptly rested its case on Thursday without calling Ms.
Steele, or any witnesses, to testify. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite more than eight hours of deliberations over two days,
the jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict on any of the four
charges of obstruction of justice and making false statements to
federal investigators stemming from what Ms. Willey described as
Clinton's unwelcome advances in a White House encounter in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In a note to the judge late Friday afternoon, the jury foreman
wrote that they were ``hopelessly deadlocked'' and ``any further
deliberations will not change the outcome.'' U.S. District Judge
Claude M. Hilton announced that the foreman had underlined the
word, ``not,'' to emphasize the point. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I will then declare a mistrial in this case,'' Hilton
told the jurors, ``and we'll excuse you all.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Neither the foreman, nor any members of the seven-woman,
five-man jury, would talk about their deliberations as they left
the court house. Afterward, Ms. Steele, 52, beamed, telling
reporters, ``It's time to start my life again.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that she hoped it would be the last time that she
would have to have her photograph taken on the steps of a court
house. ``It's been a long, long road,'' Ms. Steele said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors declined to say whether they would seek a
retrial of Ms. Steele. And although they also refused to express
their feelings about the outcome, their expressions made it clear
that the mistrial was a deep disappointment. ``I'm proud of my
legal team and the job they did,'' said prosecutor David Barger. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Ms. Steele marked the first and only
criminal prosecution arising from Starr's lengthy investigation of
the president and his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The she-said, she-said case rested on the jurors' evaluation of
the truthfulness of Ms. Willey and Ms. Steele, whose differing
accounts of the 1993 episode discouraged Starr from sending the
Willey matter to the House of Representatives as part of his
impeachment referral.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors advanced the argument that Ms. Steele had been told
by Ms. Willey about her encounter with the president on Nov. 29,
1993, several hours after it allegedly occured. They said Ms.
Steele had lied when she refused to corroborate it to the grand
jury.
</P>
<P>
   But defense lawyers say that Ms. Steele did not hear about the
incident until March 1997, when Ms. Willey asked her friend to lie
about it to Michael Isikoff, a reporter at Newsweek magazine.
</P>
<P>
   During an initial interview with Isikoff, Ms. Steele did confirm
hearing about the encounter, but later she recanted, telling the
reporter that Ms. Willey had asked her to lie about it.
</P>
<P>
   Barger said that Ms. Steele changed her story because she was
motivated by money. Ms. Steele sold a photograph of Ms. Willey and
the president to The National Enquirer for $7,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was willing to make money off her friend,'' prosecutor
Stephen Binhak said during his closing argument. ``Selling the
story is what defendant Steele wanted all along.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steele's conviction was clearly a top priority for Starr,
who had six members of his office sitting behind two prosecution
tables in the courtroom all week. By contrast, Ms. Steele had three
defense lawyers seated with her. Starr, who was traveling Friday in
Florida, was informed of the mistrial by deputy independent counsel
Jay Apperson, who declined to say whether a retrial would be
sought. But he added, ``It would be nice to get a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Had she been convicted, Ms. Steele faced a maximum of 35 years
in prison and $1 million in fines. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years, Ms. Steele and Ms. Willey were close friends, but
they have been pitted against each other in an escalating battle
since the summer of 1997. Their deep animosity for each other was
on display this week, as Ms. Willey shot angry glances toward Ms.
Steele, who sat several feet from the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   Although it appeared the case could possibly be a forum for one
final performance from the scandal's major figures, such as Ms.
Lewinsky and Linda Tripp, most of the witnesses were friends and
acquaintances of Ms. Steele and Ms. Willey. The trial was less a
reprisal of last year's voices and instead it became a forum for
the bitter dissolution of their once close friendship.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ms. Steele's lawyers, Eric Dubelier, asked Ms. Willey to
describe a confrontation with Ms. Steele at a Richmond supermarket
over Easter weekend. Ms. Willey acknowledged that she had called
Ms. Steele an obscenity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which of the women to believe became impossible for the jurors
to decide after Ms. Steele's lawyers took the calculated risk of
resting their case without calling her to testify. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the jury seemed to want to hear from Ms. Steele when
they asked the judge during their deliberations for a tape-recorder
to listen to audiotapes of phone messages she had left for a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Luque, the lead attorney for Ms. Steele, said that her
client had been eager to testify but had decided her testimony was
unnecessary because Starr's prosecutors had failed to prove their
case. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Willey acknowledged that she had lied to investigators about
a relationship she had had in 1995 with a younger man. She said she
did so because she was embarrassed about the affair. Dubelier made
the point that prosecutors could have chosen to revoke Ms. Willey's
immunity agreement, but instead they simply forgave her. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the independent counsel, Starr, who betrayed the rule
of law,'' Ms. Luque said in her closing argument. ``This is
America. They can indict anybody, but only you can convict. Only
you can stop this. I think you will.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although she said in her final arguments that Ms. Steele was hit
by Starr's ``runaway train,'' Ms. Luque admonished Ms. Steele
outside the courthouse not to say anything about the prosecutors.
Ms. Steele left the courthouse in a blue van, accompanied by her
two grown children and Richard Gooding, a tabloid reporter whom she
called a friend.

EDITORIAL: THE NEED FOR CARE AS WELL AS PROFIT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, May 8:
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the 1990s will be remembered as the decade
when developers and older, affluent, anxious Americans discovered
each other with enthusiasm, with results both encouraging and
worrisome. The concept that both they and Wall Street have embraced
is called assisted living. There is no common definition of it.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the 50 states regulates it differently, and the federal
government not at all. But to older retirees who can pay to live in
the new and reconditioned spaces sprouting across the country, the
assisted living communities offer something irresistible. It is the
promise of Pleasantville, where they can live out their lives
gracefully, with hotel services, assistance when they need it, and
the chance to hold off or avoid what many of the aged most fear _
the nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   For developers, some with no experience in caring for the aged,
the attraction is clear. The number of old people of financial
means is growing. Some 6.5 million now need some help with the
chores of daily living. That figure is expected to double by 2020.
Ten years ago there was not even an industry trade group. Today the
Assisted Living Federation of America estimates there is a
kaleidoscopic collection of about 30,000 such facilities in the
United States, with a million old people living in them, almost all
of whom pay their own way.
</P>
<P>
   Some facilities fall into state licensing categories, and some
do not. Their average national monthly rate per person is $1,500,
but elegant two-bedroom units on Long Island may rent for $5,000 or
more. The National Investment Conference, a group that specializes
in the senior housing market, found in a survey of 73 assisted
living developments released this year that the median profit
margin was 29 percent. For a quarter of the properties, it was more
than 35 percent. Those numbers warm Wall Street, but do not
guarantee that the communities deliver high-quality services.
</P>
<P>
   Because the phenomenon has grown up around existing rules, many
kinds of places can advertise ``assisted living.'' A government
Accounting Office survey, performed at the request of the U.S.
Senate Special Committee on Aging, found that about half the
residents sign up without being sure what services the facilities
provide, how much they cost or what medical care the residents can
count on. A quarter of the places surveyed were cited for five or
more problems involving quality of care or resident protection
within two years.
</P>
<P>
   When Albert Fleischmann, 85, a St. Petersburg Yacht Club member
and retired owner of a hardware chain, moved into an assisted
living facility in Pinellas County, Florida, in 1997, his daughter
was reassured. Patricia Fleischmann Johnson heads a charity that
serves as guardian for 134 people in such places. But when
Fleischmann suffered a heart attack at his table in the dining room
this year, he was ignored. He called his daughter. She took him to
the hospital. She then called back to ask the facility how he was,
and was told _ as if he were there _ that he was ``fine.'' Because
Fleischmann likes the place, he is still there. But his daughter,
who testified before the Senate committee, is more concerned now,
and she is not alone.
</P>
<P>
   There are no pending bills in Congress, but 32 states are
expected to consider legislation this year to increase regulation
of the assisted living industry. They should do so. With so many
frail lives and so much money involved, this issue is not going
away.

 &HT;    House begins inquiry into Atlanta's bid
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A U.S. House subcommittee began an inquiry Thursday
into Atlanta's Olympic bid effort and is sending federal
investigators to review all records related to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee wants to know if the same kind of improprieties
that tarnished the Salt Lake City bid effort occurred during
Atlanta's campaign for the 1996 Olympics, according to a letter to
bid chairman Billy Payne.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing would make me feel better than to know Atlanta has a
clean bill of health,'' Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) said Thursday.
Upton is co-chairman of the House Committee on Commerce's
subcommittee on oversight and investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to use all means necessary to get to the bottom of
this one way or another,'' Upton said.
</P>
<P>
   Upton and Rep. Tom Bliley Jr. (R-Va.) said in the letter to
Payne that they are seeking information about gifts and payments to
members of the International Olympic Committee during the bid
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to begin to ascertain whether the regrettable events
surrounding the IOC's selection of Salt Lake City were an
aberration, or part of a broader practice associated with other
Olympic site selection bids,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee is trying to determine if the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act should extend to the IOC, which is undergoing massive
reforms because of the corruption scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation, chaired by Payne, said
Thursday it welcomed the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel this represents an opportunity to have an objective
and legitimate review of how Atlanta won the Games without the
pressure of lawyers and the press,'' foundation spokesman Lee
Echols said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers said they are sending investigators to review all
1,400 boxes of documents related to the bid and staging of the
Games. The records are stored at the Atlanta History Center and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   They requested that the foundation ``take every available
precaution to ensure that all records'' _ including those already
purged from the files _ related to the activities of GAAF, the
Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games and the IOC are preserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympic organizers,'' Echols said, ``have always said from
the beginning we would welcome and fully cooperate with any federal
inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the foundation said it is willing to cooperate with
federal investigators, and has offered to make its records
available to the state attorney general, it filed a lawsuit in
Fulton County Superior Court on Wednesday seeking a judge's
declaration that the historical record of the Atlanta Olympic bid
campaign is private and not subject to the Georgia Open Records
Act.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker said earlier Thursday
that he intends to be ``heavily involved'' in the open-records
litigation
</P>
<P>
   In a strongly worded opinion issued Wednesday, Baker said he
believes that the records are public and should be made available
as quickly as possible. Reading GAAF's lawsuit Thursday ``doesn't
change my opinion that the records need to be released,'' Baker
said.
</P>
<P>
   In its suit, the foundation claims that the dispute is not about
whether GAAF acted improperly during the bid process but about
``whether private volunteers who give their time and money to
support an important project in their community are to have their
privacy, their confidences and their financial information subject
to public invasion.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation argues that it was formed by a ``collection of
volunteers'' who exercised no governmental power and pursued the
Games only on the condition that the city would not be financially
liable.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said the files should be made public because of the
``overwhelmingly public nature of the 1996 Olympics (and) the
inextricable link between private interests and government entities
in the pursuit'' of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's complaint included a letter from former Mayor
Andrew Young to Baker, asserting that he believed the bid effort
was a ``privately funded initiative conducted by private
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Young wrote that, although he was a member of the foundation's
board of directors and he supported the bid group's effort, the
board appointment was ``not as an ex officio position due to my
role as Atlanta Mayor.'' If that were the case, Young said,
subsequent mayors would have assumed the board position.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said he did not know what role his office would play but
added, ``It is fair to say we are going to be heavily involved in
this matter, for obvious reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Echols said, ``We have offered all of the records to Attorney
General Baker for his review, but he declined our invitiation. We
really are delighted that the House committee wants to, in a way,
to accept our invitation.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker said he would not review the records unless attorneys for
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which has sought to open the
records, are allowed the same opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question of fairness,'' Baker said. ``We need to make
sure both sides have an opportunity to know what you are fussing
about.''

this one way or another,'' Upton said.
</P>
<P>
   Upton and Rep. Tom Bliley Jr. (R-Va.) said in the letter to
Payne that they are seeking information about gifts and payments to
members of the International Olympic Committee during the bid
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to begin to ascertain whether the regrettable events
surrounding the IOC's selection of Salt Lake City were an
aberration, or part of a broader practice associated with other
Olympic site selection bids,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee is trying to determine if the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act should extend to the IOC, which is undergoing massive
reforms because of the corruption scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation, chaired by Payne, said
Thursday it welcomed the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel this represents an opportunity to have an objective
and legitimate review of how Atlanta won the Games without the
pressure of lawyers and the press,'' foundation spokesman Lee
Echols said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers said they are sending investigators to review all
1,400 boxes of documents related to the bid and staging of the
Games. The records are stored at the Atlanta History Center and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   They requested that the foundation ``take every available
precaution to ensure that all records'' _ including those already
purged from the files _ related to the activities of GAAF, the
Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games and the IOC are preserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympic organizers,'' Echols said, ``have always said from
the beginning we would welcome and fully cooperate with any federal
inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the foundation said it is willing to cooperate with
federal investigators, and has offered to make its records
available to the state attorney general, it filed a lawsuit in
Fulton County Superior Court on Wednesday seeking a judge's
declaration that the historical record of the Atlanta Olympic bid
campaign is private and not subject to the Georgia Open Records
Act.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Thurbert Baker said earlier Thursday that he
intends to be ``heavily involved'' in the open-records litigation
</P>
<P>
   In a strongly worded opinion issued Wednesday, Baker said he
believes that the records are public and should be made available
as quickly as possible. Reading GAAF's lawsuit Thursday ``doesn't
change my opinion that the records need to be released,'' Baker
said.
</P>
<P>
   In its suit, the foundation claims that the dispute is not about
whether GAAF acted improperly during the bid process but about
``whether private volunteers who give their time and money to
support an important project in their community are to have their
privacy, their confidences and their financial information subject
to public invasion.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation argues that it was formed by a ``collection of
volunteers'' who exercised no governmental power and pursued the
Games only on the condition that the city would not be financially
liable.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said the files should be made public because of the
``overwhelmingly public nature of the 1996 Olympics (and) the
inextricable link between private interests and government entities
in the pursuit'' of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's complaint included a letter from former Mayor
Andrew Young to Baker, asserting that he believed the bid effort
was a ``privately funded initiative conducted by private
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Young wrote that, although he was a member of the foundation's
board of directors and he supported the bid group's effort, the
board appointment was ``not as an ex officio position due to my
role as Atlanta Mayor.'' If that were the case, Young said,
subsequent mayors would have assumed the board position.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said he did not know what role his office would play but
added, ``It is fair to say we are going to be heavily involved in
this matter, for obvious reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Echols said, ``We have offered all of the records to Attorney
General Baker for his review, but he declined our invitiation. We
really are delighted that the House committee wants to, in a way,
to accept our invitation.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker said he would not review the records unless attorneys for
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which has sought to open the
records, are allowed the same opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question of fairness,'' Baker said. ``We need to make
sure both sides have an opportunity to know what you are fussing
about.''

COMMENT: IT'S TIME SHOCK-TALK TV TOOK SOME RESPONSIBILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: This story also moved in the ``e'' entertainment news 
 file)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``Jenny Jones'' verdict threatens to introduce a disturbing
new element into TV's shock-talk jungle _ responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the industry is aghast.
</P>
<P>
   If Friday's verdict somehow stands up on appeal, it could spoil
the long and lavish party for Jones, Jerry Springer, Ricki Lake and
their ilk.
</P>
<P>
   A Michigan jury decided that the producers of the syndicated TV
show were negligent, to the tune of $25 million, in the case of a
``Jenny Jones'' guest who murdered a gay man who had revealed that
he had a crush on him.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Schmitz is serving a 25- to 50-year prison term for
shooting Scott Amedure three days after the show's ``secret
admirer'' segment was taped in 1995. Because of the murder, the
show never aired.
</P>
<P>
   Amedure's family brought a wrongful-death suit against
Telepictures, which produces ``Jenny Jones,'' and Warner Bros.
Television, which syndicates it. Both are units of the
entertainment giant Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling that the defendants negligently caused Amedure's death,
the jury awarded his family $5 million for his pain and suffering,
$10 million for their loss of his companionship, $10 million for
the loss of his future earnings and $6,500 for funeral expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Jones issued a statement calling the verdict ``outrageous'' _
she ought to know outrageous when she sees it _ and Telepictures
President Jim Paratore said the jury had been ``misled and
distracted'' by the Amedures' attorney, Geoffrey Fieger, and his
``inflammatory rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   Paratore said the verdict will be appealed.
</P>
<P>
   There were perfunctory gasps elsewhere in the broadcasting
business, too, and professed fears that the verdict would clamp a
chilling effect on television's burgeoning realm of reality
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Good. This is a corner of TV that needs not only a good chill
but maybe a chest cold, a full bout of pneumonia and a funeral
dirge.
</P>
<P>
   Shows that stage outlandish surprises and spontaneous
confrontations ought to take responsibility for the consequences.
Amedure's death was a consequence.
</P>
<P>
   But in the circus world of TV today, responsibility is a stuffy
and antiquated notion. ``Jenny Jones'' and shows like it coax
participants onto the air, exploit them, then cast them to the
wolves.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it's a stretch to compare the ``Jenny Jones'' case with
the tragic massacre in Littleton, Colo., last month. But there is
something worth pondering. While it's a desultory exercise to pin
the blame for Littleton on everyone's favorite scapegoat, the
media, it may be true that the media are part of an array of
contributing factors.
</P>
<P>
   That certainly includes the anything-goes ambience of the worst
daytime talk shows, where hooting, jeering, name-calling,
psychological ambushes, freely vented rage and fistfights are
commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   There's a subtler connection. Jeanne Albronda Heaton, an Ohio
University psychologist and co-author of ``Tuning In Trouble,'' a
1995 book about the unsavory talk shows, points out that these
shows promote the idea, appealing but infantile, that one's
problems are always someone else's fault.
</P>
<P>
   In Littleton, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold apparently lashed
out in murderous anger at peers they blamed for their problems.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's ``Jenny Jones'' verdict, some media observers
expressed concern that journalism as well as entertainment could be
affected. Is a critic, for example, now responsible for the effects
of a bad review?
</P>
<P>
   But there is a distinction. Journalists describe and evaluate
the action, but they don't set the stage. ``Jenny Jones'' and
similar shows do, deliberately setting up what Heaton calls ``a
kind of parade of pathology with nobody minding the shop and nobody
responsible for the outcome.'' Heaton wrote that before Amedure was
shot.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Heaton said that in talking with talk-show producers and
harried, youthful assistant producers when she was researching her
book, she was astonished to find that ``the idea of ethics was
laughable. To them, the only thing that matters is ratings.''
</P>
<P>
   Look at it another way. If you invite guests to a party, and
then strew banana peels and roller skates around your sidewalk and
doorstep, aren't you responsible if someone slips and falls?
</P>
<P>
   Those slips and slides are what the producers behind Jerry
Springer and Jenny Jones rely on for the lively entertainment of
their audience.
</P>
<P>
   Since Amedure was killed, money has continued to speak louder
than murder. Even the Jones show, which never acknowledged a whit
of responsibility, has continued to stage sexual ambushes and
surprises.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict reintroduces the idea that TV shows generate
consequences other than enriching producers, stars and TV stations.
It's time, the jurors were saying, to stop passing the buck.

 Barbara Stanny is the author of ``Prince Charming Isn't Coming: How
Women Get Smart About Money''(Penguin Books, 1997).  
 By BARBARA STANNY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Growing up, the only advice my father ever gave me about money
was ``Don't worry.'' Beneath those words, of course, was an
unspoken assumption: There will always be a man to take care of
you.
</P>
<P>
   One would expect something more substantial from Richard Bloch,
the ``R'' of H&AMP;R Block. But my father was well-meaning. He truly
didn't want his daughter to worry about money, and he sincerely
believed that managing it was a man's job.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't going to argue. Money was too complicated. And my
husband, a former lawyer who became a stockbroker and financial
planner, was perfect for the job. Or so I thought, until I found
out that my Prince Charming was a lousy money manager.
</P>
<P>
   But even knowing that, I continued to let him handle the
finances. That's how intimidated I was by money. I just signed
whatever he told me to sign. During our 15-year marriage, he lost a
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   That would have kept up indefinitely had it not been for an
incident at the ATM. I wanted to withdraw something like $60, but
the machine wouldn't give me the money. ``Insufficient funds,'' the
screen told me. I panicked, raced home and angrily confronted my
husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry,'' he said calmly. ``I'll take care of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words felt so soothing, like a warm bath on a chilly
morning. I desperately wanted to stay submerged in my illusion of
safety. But the ATM had just thrown a bucket of ice water in my
face. I could no longer not worry. I knew I had to do something.
</P>
<P>
   After the divorce, I made some feeble attempts to learn about
money, but my brain would fog up and my eyes glaze over. I quickly
gave up and returned to my blissful state of financial ignorance.
Life, however, had other plans.
</P>
<P>
   Within two years, I received a total of over $1 million in bills
for back taxes my ex-husband never paid and penalties for a
disallowed tax shelter he put us in. He had left the country; my
signature was on the documents, so I was left holding the bag.
Unable to pay, I asked my father for a loan. He refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not supposed to worry about this stuff, remember,'' I
screamed as I slammed down the phone. I was furious, but also
terrified. I had three daughters, one just a baby. At that moment,
I knew that staying stupid was no longer an option.
</P>
<P>
   Then fate intervened. Working as a journalist, I joined a
research project on women and money. I interviewed more than 100
financially savvy women. Those interviews were life-changing.
</P>
<P>
   As I listened to how they went from being ignorant to smart
about money, I saw that it wasn't so much what they did, but how
they thought that made the difference. Each woman had come to a
series of seven realizations. I recognized immediately that those
realizations, when combined, were a process I could follow.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly what was inconceivable looked possible. In a short
time, I not only became smart about money, but I also wrote a book
to urge women to do the same. Now my publisher bills me as a
financial expert.
</P>
<P>
   How did I do it in such a short period after a lifetime of
financial lethargy? The key lies in the first realization _ the
quintessential step.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every woman I interviewed spoke of it as a turning
point, the defining moment in her financial life. They all started
with essentially the same realization: No one will do this for me.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Prince Charming isn't coming _ and please note
that the prince need not be a man. Our prince could be an insurance
settlement, the lottery or anything we fantasize will rescue us
financially.
</P>
<P>
   To become genuinely savvy, we must be able to say with total
conviction that we can do it ourselves. It doesn't matter if we are
male or female, single, married or living with a partner.
</P>
<P>
   As long as even a tiny part of us is waiting for, hoping,
expecting someone or something to assume responsibility for us, we
will never fully take charge of our finances _ and our future
security.
</P>
<P>
   For that lesson, I owe my father a debt of gratitude. He had the
guts to say no when I asked for a loan. I know now that it wasn't
easy for him. In hindsight, I see his refusal as both an admission
of wrong thinking on his part and a vote of confidence in me. It
was his way of saying: ``You can do it, I know you can, and it's
time you did.''
</P>
<P>
   I guess we both had to learn the hard way that Prince Charming
isn't coming.

TV STATION'S SUBSCRIBER DEAL WITH DNC EXPOSED BY CURIOUS MOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- A 4-year-old boy's loyal attachment to public TV's
Barney ended up making him the surprised recipient this spring of a
fund-raising pitch and ``agenda survey'' from the Democratic
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Little Sam Black got this mail because his mother, Jody Black,
included his name with hers last fall when she sent in a $40
donation to WGBH, the public TV station in Boston, never suspecting
the station would then swap names with the DNC.
</P>
<P>
   An embarrassed station official Friday admitted that, in
violation of station rules, WGBH had ``exchanged'' portions of its
225,000-member mailing list with the Democratic National Committee.
Tax experts questioned whether the deal was legal under the
station's nonprofit tax status.
</P>
<P>
   And it was the station, not the DNC, that initiated the trade.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Lifsey, director of media and community relations at WGBH
in Boston, acknowledged the list-swap after the Globe inquired at
the request of Black, who was sure that her name and her son's were
being peddled by WGBH.
</P>
<P>
   Lifsey said that, of the entire membership list, ``a few
thousand'' of the names were given to the Democratic National
Committee in exchange for an equal number given to them.
</P>
<P>
   She said some new employees who made the deal with the DNC had
not been aware of the station's policy against sharing lists with
political or religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little embarrassed about it, and sorry it happened,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   As a public relations matter, a cozy relationship with the
Democrats is not what any public television station needs. Several
years ago, some Republicans in Congress sought reduced federal
funding of public broadcasting, saying the stations were too
left-leaning.
</P>
<P>
   And as a legal matter, public television stations cannot play
political favorites. WGBH is a tax-exempt group, referred to in
legal circles as a 501(c)(3). It faces serious IRS sanctions if it
does anything that appears to be lobbying or supporting a political
party, according to Doug Fleming of Fleming &AMP; O'Neill, head of the
Massachusetts Bar Association's tax section.
</P>
<P>
   Lifsey said she is not aware of any other occasion when the
station violated its mailing list policy. When asked if the
Republicans were approached about exchanging lists, she said they
were not.
</P>
<P>
   All of this may not have come to light had it not been for
Black, a former corporate lawyer who is now at home full time to
raise her two young children. Sometime last fall, she donated $40
to WBGH, partly in gratitude for all the children's programs on the
channel. She made out the membership donation in her name and the
name of her oldest child, Sam.
</P>
<P>
   She said it was the only time their two names appeared together
on a mailing list. When her WGBH membership card and other mailings
came to Sam and Jody Black, she was amused thinking that WGBH
probably thought Sam was her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in the past month, she received in the mail a
questionnaire and donation request from the Democratic National
Committee. While the envelope was addressed to ``Sam Black and Jody
Black,'' the survey and money pitch inside was addressed only to
Sam.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old mother instantly made the connection. She said
she was appalled that WGBH shared her name with a political party,
not to mention that it was the source of unwanted junk mail.
</P>
<P>
   She said the station should have told her about its marketing of
mailing lists. ``At the very least,'' she said, ``I should have
been given the opportunity to restrict usage of the information I
furnished to them.''
</P>
<P>
   WGBH officials say when someone signs up, they receive a
membership packet that contains an ``opt-out'' card. If filled out,
the member's name and information will not be shared with any other
group. Black does not recall such a card.
</P>
<P>
   Lifsey said she is aware of consumers' hatred of junk mail, but
she said ``it's a standard industry practice'' for nonprofits like
WGBH to swap or ``rent'' lists to other nonprofits or other groups
in an effort to expand membership.
</P>
<P>
   She emphasized they do not ``sell'' lists. She said ``renting''
names means the other group can use WGBH names for one mailing
only.
</P>
<P>
   Lifsey said on average, WGBH has some kind of mailing list
exchange or rental about four times a month.
</P>
<P>
   In Wellesley home, Jody Black said she'd like the chance to fill
out the form that prohibits WGBH from sharing her or her son's name
with others. Will she fill out the Democratic survey? It's
doubtful, she's a registered Republican.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO forces pounding the center of Belgrade
apparently struck China's embassy Friday night, only hours after
knocking out electrical power across much of the country. Yugoslav
authorities immediately reported numerous injuries, both inside and
outside the embassy, which they said held 26 people at the time,
and offered conflicting accounts about fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are greatly shocked by the reports of NATO's bombing of the
Chinese Embassy,'' China's ambassador to the United Nations, Qin
Huasun said, ``NATO's barbarian act is a violation of the U.N.
Charter.''
</P>
<P>
   Only moments before reports of the strike on the embassy, which
was hit just before midnight in Belgrade, NATO officials
acknowledged that cluster bombs dropped from an F-16 fighter jet
had caused extensive damage to a hospital complex and marketplace
in Nis, Yugoslavia's third largest city. Belgrade said 15 people
died in that attack.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials, who escorted journalists to the scene,
reported that an additional 60 were wounded. Dismembered bodies lay
on a street nearby around yellow casings from the cluster bombs,
which upon detonating cover a target with smaller bomblets.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy, in the new section of the capital west of the Sava
River, is near the headquarters of a television station owned by a
close associate of Milosevic. Smoke and flames poured from
blown-out windows of the two-story embassy building, which was
fully evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   A Yugoslav official said 26 people were in the building when it
was hit, and some were taken to hospitals but none with serious
injuries. But a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Nebojsa Vujovic, said,
``there are deaths and injuries,'' without providing details.
</P>
<P>
   China's Xinhua news agency said four were injured and four were
missing. There was no immediate reaction from the Chinese
government.
</P>
<P>
   The damage to the embassy is certain to add still more tumult to
already strained relationship with NATO and the United States for
China, which has been sharply critical of NATO's air war. On
Thursday, China's foreign ministry called on NATO to halt the
bombing, saying it had caused ``great civilian casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   As a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, China has
veto power over any settlement of the conflict that would have the
international body's imprimatur.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing we can say at this point,'' the Pentagon's
spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The White House immediately reached out to China's embassy here
in Washington to inform its diplomats of the strike, an
administration official said. Later, America's ambassador to China,
James Sasser, spoke with Chinese government officials in Beijing,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. secretary general, Kofi Annan, was ``shocked and
distressed'' at the report, his spokemsan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese delegate to the United Nations, Qin, said, ``We call
on NATO to stop immediately its military actions so as to avoid
further humanitarian disasters.'' He added that it was possible his
country would call a special meeting of the Security Council to
address the incident and that ``NATO should be responsible for all
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO and Pentagon officials were scrambling for information that
could explain whether one of its missiles or bombs was involved.
The strike occurred during a powerful series of explosions from
NATO bombs that rocked the capital through the evening.
</P>
<P>
   After nightfall, allied warplanes attacked four electrical
transformers in and around Belgrade, once again darkening the
capital and much of the rest of the country. The raids reportedly
struck several government and military buildings in Belgrade's
center, as well as the city's main power plant.
</P>
<P>
   The barrage in Belgrade followed a three-day lull in strikes
against the capital that coincided with diplomatic efforts to end
NATO's air campaign against Yugoslavia, even though NATO officials
insisted there was no correlation.
</P>
<P>
   Even as diplomats from Washington to Moscow shuttled from
capital to capital carrying the outlines of a settlement, the
United States and NATO vowed to keep intensifying the attacks,
which continued for a 45th day.
</P>
<P>
   A consequence of NATO's intensified assault has been growing
numbers of misfires and civilian deaths, which the alliance has
repeatedly said it hoped to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   For the fifth time, a stray missile landed in Bulgaria. No one
was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and Pentagon officials reported a large attack by allied
warplanes against the airfield in Nis, as well as a radio tower,
but at least one bomb fell short of its targets, for reasons that
were still not clear, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, it is highly probable that a weapon went astray
and hit civilian buildings,'' a statement released late Friday at
NATO's headquarters in Brussels said. ``There was no intent to harm
civilians during this strike.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, NATO has emphasized that civilian deaths were
always a possibility in warfare, despite the technological
precision of its laser- and satellite-guided weapons. But NATO has
found itself on the defensive after several incidents resulted in
dozens of deaths _ from the bombing of a train crossing the Juzna
Morava River in mid-April to the destruction of a neighborhood in
Surdulica last week.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's government has used the deaths to portray NATO's
attacks as indiscriminate acts of barbarity.
</P>
<P>
   To counter what many officials here consider disproportionate
attention to NATO's mistakes, the Pentagon Friday provided a
compilation of reports of atrocities attributed to Milosevic's
campaign of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. The Pentagon's compilation
detailed more than 20 towns or cities inside of Kosovo where more
than 100 people were reported killed or more than 1,000 people had
been displaced.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon, the Pentagon's spokesman, said that the compilation,
based on American intelligence reports and reports by refugees,
showed that 100,000 military-age men from Kosovo have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some may have been used to dig graves,'' he said. ``Some may
have been forced to support the Serb military in various ways. We
have reports that some have been used as human shields. Some may
have died in the hills or working. We just don't know, and that's
one of the mysteries that won't be resolved until this conflict is
over.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, foreign ministers from NATO's six major members and
Russia, joined by Japan, reached an agreement for the first time
about the need for an international force to protect Kosovo and
ensure the return of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians
driven from their homes by Yugoslavia's military and police forces.
</P>
<P>
   Although significant details remain unresolved, the agreement
and Russia's growing role as an intermediary appeared to signal a
turn after six and a half weeks of daily bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Despite expressing a willingness to seek a settlement, U.S. and
NATO officials vowed again Friday to keep intensifying the attacks
until Milosevic agreed to withdraw his forces from the province,
accept a NATO-led peacekeeping force and allow the refugees to
return.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting American troops and political leaders in Macedonia,
Gen. Henry Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
the diplomatic efforts would have no effect on the air war. ``The
campaign will continue until such time as Milosevic has agreed to
the terms established by NATO,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite poor weather, airstrikes continued to pound Yugoslavia's
cities and its armed forces in Kosovo. Overnight on Thursday,
American and NATO forces attacked 16 pre-planned targets, including
a bridge over the Danube River on Yugoslavia's border with Romania.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Charles Wald, a senior officer on the Pentagon's joint
staff, said allied warplanes also attacked nine other targets that
were encountered during the raids.
</P>
<P>
   As night fell in Belgrade, officials said they expected a heavy
night of bombing in the Yugoslav capital.

 &HT;    Storms threaten northwest Georgia
 &HT;    By Gita M. Smith and Jennifer Brett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tornadoes and severe thunderstorms formed a
threatening crescent to the west and north of Atlanta on Friday,
but they stayed away from the heart of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The storms maintained a steady traveling speed of 35 miles per
hour throughout the afternoon and evening, shooting a twister down
in Bremen and prompting warning sirens to sound in Cherokee, Cobb,
Carroll, Paulding and Haralson counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no reports of fatalities or even serious injuries,''
said Pamela Swanson, spokeswoman for the Georgia Emergency
Management Agency. In Paulding County, there were reports of damage
to trees and barns. In Carroll County _ where the first
``touchdown'' occurred at 4:27 p.m. _ some structural damage was
reported, but no injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The storm moved across the line into Haralson County where it
spawned a tornado in Bremen around 4:30, causing damage to property
along Highway 78 and Pacific Road.
</P>
<P>
   The twister turned the Wade Brothers' mobile home sales lot into
a sea of debris. Owner Truman Wade estimated 35 mobile homes were
damaged or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Employee Kendall Bell watched as a mobile home from the back of
the lot went airborne and crashed into the roof of the dealership.
</P>
<P>
   About 6,000 people were without electricity in Haralson County _
5,000 of them in Bremen, a Georgia Power spokesman said. The
utility said it expected to restore electricity by noon today.
</P>
<P>
   Northward, in Cobb County, a funnel cloud was reported over
Kennesaw, but it did not touch down, Swanson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A funnel was sighted in Cherokee County at Bell's Ferry and
Sixes Road, but it also stayed aloft, and no damage was reported,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   After dark, severe thunderstorm warnings continued in Cobb,
North Fulton, Troup, Meriwether and Dawson counties.
</P>
<P>
   At Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport, flights were
delayed and canceled throughout the day and evening.
</P>
<P>
   The cancellations were owed to a band of bad weather extending
from Georgia to Boston, spokeswoman LaniiThomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, Alabama and parts of the Carolinas were under nearly
continuous tornado watches Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In Cherokee, storm sirens interrupted jury deliberations in the
Jonathan Miller murder trial for 45 minutes. The jurors were sent
to the ground floor of the Canton courthouse when a tornado warning
was issued.
</P>
<P>
   A ferocious storm cell straddled Interstate 20 and headed for
Douglas County, dumping rain on evening commuters.
</P>
<P>
   In the Paulding County town of Dallas, golfball-sized hail was
reported around 5:17 p.m. Elsewhere in the county, a tornado
reportedly scooped up a chicken coop and scattered the contents
over the neighboring area.
</P>
<P>
   Paulding County Sheriff Bruce Harris said the damage happened at
Ga. Highway 101 about six miles east of the Haralson County line.
</P>
<P>
   The coops ``got tore up and the sky was raining debris,'' said
Jimmy McCarthy, who lives in southwest Paulding.
</P>
<P>
   Rain from the storm was welcomed in some quarters. Georgia
Agriculture Commissioner Tommy Irvin called the front that moved
through Thursday and Friday ``a lifesaver'' for the parched farm
belt.
</P>

Associated Press, contributed to this article.

COMMENTARY: WHEN LEADERSHIP FAILS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ At the end of this terrible century, why was another
murderous tyrant in Europe able to carry out mass killings and
expulsions?
</P>
<P>
   Weakness of leadership is the reason. Political leaders in the
West, most significantly in the United States, repeatedly turned
away from the responsibility of stopping a menacing psychopath.
</P>
<P>
   Slobodan Milosevic did not begin his campaign of terror two
months or two years ago. He began in September 1991, when Serb
artillery shelled _ and in due course leveled _ the Croatian city
of Vukovar.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush was president, and he did nothing. He did nothing
the next year, when the Serbs began their cruel war of rape, ethnic
cleansing and murder in Bosnia. The recent book by Bush and his
national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, ``A World
Transformed,'' does not mention Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Eagleburger, deputy secretary of state at the time,
wrote last month on The New York Times Op-Ed page that NATO's
credibility must be preserved ``or all the would-be Milosevics
around the world will believe that they, too, can kill and maim
with impunity.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was from Larry Eagleburger and the rest of the Bush
administration that Milosevic learned he could kill with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton came to office in 1993 promising a tough line
against the Serb aggressors in Bosnia. But he fiddled while Serb
shells rained on Sarajevo. He finally acted, calling the Dayton
conference, only when shamed by the Serb massacre at Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   European leaders were no better. A Conservative government in
Britain led the way in appeasement of the Serbs. A British general
in charge of peacekeeping forces in Bosnia, Michael Rose, blocked
responses to Serb outrages. (Today, retired, Rose writes newspaper
articles urging NATO to give up the conflict with Milosevic.)
</P>
<P>
   After Dayton, Richard Holbrooke and others expected the
international force that moved into Bosnia to arrest the two
Bosnian Serb leaders indicted for war crimes, Radovan Karadzic and
Ratko Mladic. Karadzic, it was thought, might give evidence on
Milosevic's role in the slaughter. But they were not arrested, then
or since. Milosevic read that as a sign that we did not really care
about his savagery.
</P>
<P>
   Given that dismal history, what confidence can we have that the
United States and its allies at last understand the menace of
Slobodan Milosevic? Confidence that they will stick to their
fundamental demands in the conflict over Kosovo?
</P>
<P>
   There is, understandably, much skepticism. It animated some of
the reaction to the agreement made Thursday by the Group of Seven
with Russia on steps for a political settlement of the Kosovo
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement fudged two of the crucial NATO demands: that Serb
forces be withdrawn from Kosovo (NATO has not said ``all'' forces
but means virtually all), and that an international force with NATO
at its core take over security. A Wall Street Journal editorial on
the agreement concluded: ``Once again the NATO allies are proposing
to let Slobodan Milosevic off the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   But as one who has been a hawk on Milosevic for eight years, I
think there are some reasons for confidence now.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and other NATO leaders are determined to get the
expelled ethnic Albanians back into Kosovo. And they know that the
Kosovars will not go back unless all significant Serb forces have
pulled out and an international armed force with NATO at its core
has taken over in Kosovo. That means, as one American put it to me,
a force headed by the NATO commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, and
responsible politically to the NATO council.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is the attitude of the European members of NATO.
They have plainly learned how dangerous it is to tolerate
Milosevic, and they are surprisingly united behind the bombing
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A diplomat put it to me that NATO members have a ``steely
resolve to make their demands irreducible.'' Skepticism is still
needed. If there is resolve, it will have to hold through much more
of a brutal conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, who cares nothing about other lives, has a talent for
his own survival. But maybe the West has learned that it must say
no to him, and mean it.

JONES VERDICT SEEN A WARNING FOR TALK SHOWS, JOURNALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Edits thruout; a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Michigan jury found ``The Jenny Jones Show'' negligent in the
murder of a guest on the program, in a ruling decried by First
Amendment advocates and seen as an ominous warning about public
anger not only at trash television, but at the increasingly murky
mix of entertainment and journalism.
</P>
<P>
   The $25 million verdict stemmed from a ``Jenny Jones'' episode
in which one guest, Scott Amedure, revealed himself as the secret
admirer of another guest, Jonathan Schmitz. Three days after the
March 1995 taping, an apparently humiliated Schmitz shot and killed
Amedure. He is currently awaiting retrial after a 1996 murder
conviction was thrown out on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Jones's secret admirer show seemed ``unusual and extreme, even
by talk television standards,'' TV historian Alex McNeil said.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to find anyone with a kind word for the sort of
video voyeurism that the jury penalized with its verdict Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But many observers believe that the decision is more than simply
a repudiation of junk programming. They interpret it as part of a
public backlash against a range of media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a jury found ABC liable for $5.5 million in damages
after it used undercover reporters to unearth allegedly unsanitary
conditions at the Food Lion supermarket chain. Last year, The
Cincinnati Enquirer's use of purloined voice mail messages in an
expose of Chiquita Brands International Inc. spawned a major
criminal investigation of the paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reaction is first that it's another sign that the public is
angry at the `media at large,' '' said Tom Rosenstiel, director of
the Project for Excellence in Journalism. ``And it's a warning
signal to journalists that that the public in some manner . . .
wants to hold us accountable for consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether Jenny Jones is a journalist or not . . . any
journalist should recognize that there's a message here for them,''
he added. ``Increasingly, there is a blending of the media. What's
the difference between Oprah's book review and The New York Times
Book Review?''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Paratore, president of Telepictures Productions, which
produces ``Jenny Jones,'' announced his intention to appeal. ``The
public and every single media outlet should fear the chilling
effect this verdict, if upheld, will have on the basic interview
process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts seemed to agree.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Harvey Silverglate says he harbors few illusions about
the value of the Jones show. ``The history of incursions into the
First Amendment is they pick on the medium that doesn't have
respectable public support,'' Silverglate said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he compared the verdict to ``the other cases that
have arisen where courts have attacked the techniques by which news
has been gathered.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a continuum that goes from what we would agree is
hard news to entertainment,'' Silverglate said. ``We're talking
about one phenomenon. You cannot, as a legal matter, distinguish
between Jenny Jones and The Boston Globe.''
</P>
<P>
   Court TV anchor Rikki Klieman pointed to the performance of
plaintiffs' attorney Geoffrey Fieger _ who gained fame as Jack
Kevorkian's lawyer _ in convincing the jurors. But Klieman also
contended that the tricky First Amendment issue and the ``proximate
cause'' theory _ which contended that the show was responsible for
the subsequent murder _ ought to keep the matter in the courts for
some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly think they have viable issues on appeal,'' she
said. ``Warner Brothers would be foolish indeed not to take this
all the way to the US Supreme Court. There's never been a case like
this.'' Warner Brothers is the show's distributor.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts think the hard-core talk TV wave may have crested.
Pioneered by Morton Downey Jr. and Geraldo Rivera, TV talk has
developed into shows like Jerry Springer's, that rely on
confrontation between guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Springer took it to its illogical extreme,'' said
cultural critic Steven Stark, who points to the success of kinder,
gentler talk show hosts, such as Oprah Winfrey and Rosie O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   The Jones verdict ``probably will be seen as a turning point,''
McNeil said.``We're probably on the downside of that glut.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Jones case was one of Court TV's highest-rated
trials, Klieman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have sex, you have murder, you have possible
homosexuality. Then you've got Fieger. This would have made a
great-made-for-TV movie.''

the difference between Oprah's book review and The New York Times
Book Review?''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Paratore, president of Telepictures Productions, which
produces ``Jenny Jones,'' announced his intention to appeal. ``The
public and every single media outlet should fear the chilling
effect this verdict, if upheld, will have on the basic interview
process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts seemed to agree.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Harvey Silverglate says he harbors few illusions about
the value of the Jones show. ``The history of incursions into the
First Amendment is they pick on the medium that doesn't have
respectable public support,'' Silverglate said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he compared the verdict to ``the other cases that
have arisen where courts have attacked the techniques by which news
has been gathered.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a continuum that goes from what we would agree is
hard news to entertainment,'' Silverglate said. ``We're talking
about one phenomenon. You cannot, as a legal matter, distinguish
between Jenny Jones and The Boston Globe.''
</P>
<P>
   Court TV anchor Rikki Klieman pointed to the performance of
plaintiffs' attorney Geoffrey Fieger _ who gained fame as Jack
Kevorkian's lawyer _ in convincing the jurors. But Klieman also
contended that the tricky First Amendment issue and the ``proximate
cause'' theory _ which contended that the show was responsible for
the subsequent murder _ ought to keep the matter in the courts for
some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly think they have viable issues on appeal,'' she
said. ``Warner Brothers would be foolish indeed not to take this
all the way to the US Supreme Court. There's never been a case like
this.'' Warner Brothers is the show's distributor.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts think the hard-core talk TV wave may have crested.
Pioneered by Morton Downey Jr. and Geraldo Rivera, TV talk has
developed into shows like Jerry Springer's, that rely on
confrontation between guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Springer took it to its illogical extreme,'' said
cultural critic Steven Stark, who points to the success of kinder,
gentler talk show hosts, such as Oprah Winfrey and Rosie O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   The Jones verdict ``probably will be seen as a turning point,''
McNeil said.``We're probably on the downside of that glut.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Jones case was one of Court TV's highest-rated
trials, Klieman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have sex, you have murder, you have possible
homosexuality. Then you've got Fieger. This would have made a
great-made-for-TV movie.''

CRITIC OF FLAWED CNN REPORT IS NAMED AS SOURCE FOR IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A retired military officer who has been a leading critic of
CNN's repudiated broadcast on the use of nerve gas against
defectors in the Vietnam War was named Friday as one of the
confidential sources for the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, Maj. Gen. John Singlaub, who in the late 1960s
commanded a special forces unit in Vietnam, was identified as
someone who had confirmed the charges contained in the broadcast in
a lawsuit filed against him Friday by April Oliver, the lead
producer of the discredited report on a Vietnam mission known as
Operation Tailwind.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oliver, who was dismissed by CNN, is suing Singlaub for
breach of contract.
</P>
<P>
   Singlaub is already suing Ms. Oliver, CNN, and Peter Arnett, the
lead correspondent on the broadcast, for defamation.
</P>
<P>
   The general, who last summer said he had repeatedly warned Ms.
Oliver that she was following a false trail, Friday denied Ms.
Oliver's claim that he had corroborated the use of nerve gas in
Operation Tailwind, or that he had ever said the mission was
directed against American defectors. Both he and Ms. Oliver agree
that he was no longer in command of his special forces unit, the
Studies and Operations Group, at the time of the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's filing was the second time in recent months that a
journalist whose reporting was under attack has revealed the
identity of a confidential source, but the two cases vary greatly.
In the first case, Mike Gallagher, a reporter for The Cincinnati
Enquirer, disclosed that a lawyer for Chiquita Brands International
had helped him gain access to the company's voice-mail system. He
had promised the lawyer that he would go to jail rather than
identify him, according to evidence produced in litigation stemming
from The Enquirer's articles.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, after the CNN report was broadcast, Singlaub
appeared at a Pentagon news conference and said he had spoken with
Ms. Oliver and tried to convince her that the claims about the
nerve gas were inaccurate. He had then vociferously denounced the
report she and her co-producer, Jack Smith, had prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists often gather information from sources who refuse to
be named in the material that is eventually published or broadcast,
and it is extremely rare for the journalists to break that pledge
of confidentiality. For it to happen twice and in high-profile
cases has surprised specialists, who are divided on when, if ever,
such a disclosure is appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The CNN case, ``is possibly one of the most uncommon scenarios I
have ever heard of,'' said Sandra Barron, the executive director of
the Libel Defense Resource Center. ``It's a very unusual situation
where a confidential source sues a reporter for the story for which
he was a confidential source. One can argue that it puts the
reporter in the same position as the attorney whose client sues him
for malpractice _ it frees him from the pledge of
confidentiality.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oliver's lawsuit includes several lengthy verbatim passages
from notes she took in her six interviews with Singlaub. In these
conversations, she frequently referred to nerve gas by its military
shorthand designation _ either CBU-15 or GB. Another designation,
CS, was used for tear gas, which Pentagon officials say was used in
various operations in the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oliver's notes reflect this closing exchange in her last
interview with Singlaub, a month before the broadcast:
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oliver: ``Just one last time, your own personal
understanding of Tailwind is that it was a mission in which CBU-15,
GB, was used at least twice on the village base camp and on
extraction, and that the target was a group of American
defectors.''
</P>
<P>
   Singlaub: ``You are not going to use my name on this, are you?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oliver: ``No sir, you are on background as a senior military
official.''
</P>
<P>
   Singlaub: ``Yeah, that's my view.''
</P>
<P>
   On hearing this exchange in a telephone interview, Singlaub
said: ``I deny that I said that. I never once thought this thing
had taken place, so I can't imagine how she would write things that
would put those thoughts down.''
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter read a portion of the notes, which also shows
him agreeing to a question posed about the use of ``CBU-15,'' he
said. ``Gosh. You know, I may have been mixed up on what CBU-15
was. It was my understanding that we were talking about CS, and
that's the only thing I ever agreed was used.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I just don't believe that the total conversation she
could have assumed I supported that wild story when in fact it
never entered my mind that it was possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oliver's counterclaim against Singlaub accuses him of breach
of contract. In an interview, she denied the general's claim that
he repeatedly warned her off the story.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Friday, Ms. Oliver said: ``Singlaub shattered our
confidentiality contract. First, he told the public he wasn't a
source. Then, at a Pentagon press conference in July, he told the
world he was a source, but had always denied the story. Then he
filed suit against me.''
</P>
<P>
   In a companion legal action, Ms. Oliver on Friday sued CNN for
wrongful dismissal, breach of contract, and defamation. In an
interview, she said she was having difficulty pursuing a career in
journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a pretty good career,'' she said. ``I loved what I did.
I'm looking into law school now. It's going to be hard enough to
carry this burden in journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   A CNN spokesman said Friday that the network would have no
comment on the case.

 Schwab Chief Responds to SEC Criticism
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Sam Zuckerman &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
The top executive of Charles Schwab Corp., the nation's largest
online broker, said he agrees with most of the criticisms recently
leveled at the electronic brokerage industry by the head of the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In an impromptu interview earlier this week at a Schwab
conference in San Francisco, Schwab co-chief executive David
Pottruck said though that the SEC should not have singled out
Internet brokers. ``The one issue we have is that many of the
issues facing online firms are issues facing all brokers,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt in a Washington, D.C., speech earlier
this week warned online brokers that they must do a better job
protecting investors from stock-market risks.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt criticized firms whose ads suggest online stock trading
is a recipe for getting rich quick. Without mentioning the
advertiser by name, he condemned a Discover Brokerage commercial
that features a tow-truck driver who buys an island with his stock
gains.
</P>
<P>
   Pottruck said other firms, not Schwab, were responsible for
encouraging false hopes. ``There is no question that some of our
competitors advertise that getting on the Net and achieving a
fortune is something any investor can do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab's own ads stress how the Internet gives investors more
control over their finances.
</P>
<P>
   A Discover spokesman said the firm supports Levitt's call for
informing investors about market risks but declined to discuss the
content of the firm's commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt said in his speech that brokers must make sure they have
the capacity to handle the rapid growth of online trading, that
they execute customer orders at the best possible price and that
they clearly disclose Internet investing risks.
</P>
<P>
   Critics suggest that Internet trading makes trading stocks so
easy that some investors end up putting money into the market
without thinking through their actions.
</P>
<P>
   Pottruck didn't address that issue but he agreed that online
trading lowers barriers to investing. ``There's less friction in
the system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab's chief said the stock market as a whole isn't overvalued
but many individual issues are trading at prices that make little
sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still plenty (of reasonably priced stocks) out
there,'' he said. ``But there are an awful lot of stocks that
reflect no underlying economic model.''
</P>
<P>
   Like its electronic brokerage rivals, Schwab has been all but
swamped by the surge in online trading volume. Trading rocketed 49
percent in the quarter ended March 31, according to Piper Jaffray,
a Minneapolis brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab customers have complained in recent months about
recurring problems getting through to the broker's Internet site,
reaching the firm by telephone or getting timely responses to
e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab has been feverishly adding employees and computer
capacity to keep up with demand, but company officials admit they
have had trouble staying ahead of the curve.
</P>
<P>
   In his conference speech before the interview, Pottruck said the
firm has learned that building capacity is much more complicated
than simply plugging in more computers. ``You start finding out
about stress points and bottlenecks that you never new existed,''
he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Pottruck was speaking Thursday at an event aimed at recruiting
computer and Internet professionals for Schwab's online brokerage
business.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab has 60 openings locally in jobs such as software
development and technical support, part of an estimated 2,000 new
slots the firm expects to fill in the next year.

TOP TO BOTTOM, THERE'S INTRIGUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Take Pat Riley's ego, Larry Johnson's temper, the New York
tabloids, the San Antonio Spurs' flaccid playoff history and Kevin
Garnett's impending meeting with mega-stardom, and what do you get?
</P>
<P>
   Two better-than-average matchups between No. 1 and No. 8 seeds
as the NBA playoffs open today.
</P>
<P>
   These sure don't look like the usual three-and-outs that happen
when the NBA pits its elite against postseason bottom feeders, and
an upset is not considered preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why these series should be more interesting than, say,
Atlanta-Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat might be superior, but even Riley sees the
ramifications, as round 3 is about to begin between these teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``This series is beyond everybody's control,'' Riley said.
``This is preordained. This is something the gods wanted. It's the
rubber match and here we go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks have already lobbed the first grenade, expressing
their glee over facing the Heat during Wednesday's victory over
Miami. They were high-fiving on the bench and could not hide their
happiness over the outcome. Johnson echoed the fans at Madison
Square Garden who started chanting, ``We want the Heat, we want the
Heat,'' when the Knicks clinched a playoff spot Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is better than them Davis Boys (the Pacers' Dale and
Antonio) and the Dutchman (center Rik Smits),'' Johnson said. ``We
match up well against Miami because of our similar styles.''
</P>
<P>
   Be careful, L.J., because you are getting what you wish for.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they wanted us, they think they can beat us,'' Heat
guard Tim Hardaway said. ``Here's their chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The wild-card element is the fist-factor. Johnson and Alonzo
Mourning got into it last year, which resulted in Mourning's
suspension and Miami's demise. Too many players were suspended in
1997 to list here, but suspensions have determined the winner the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Without the same melodrama, Minnesota also has a chance to
inflict some damage to the Spurs. The Wolves are 6-2 with two or
more days rest and have three days off before Sunday's opener at
the Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the surprise factor. The first three times the
Spurs and Wolves played, Stephon Marbury played for Minnesota and
Chris Carr started twice. Neither is still with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, in the fourth meeting, Wolves point guard Terrell
Brandon was out with a thigh bruise, Garnett was recovering from
the flu and Anthony Peeler had yet to return from a calf injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't played us . . . the combination that's out on the
floor now,'' Garnett said.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the Spurs' lofty status, which flies in the face of
their 25-34 postseason record in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're the top gun, you're supposed to be there, you're
supposed to win,'' Minnesota coach Flip Saunders said. ``Does your
team ever get in a situation where it's playing not to lose rather
than to win?''
</P>
<P>
   Just think how good this series might have been if Wolves GM
Kevin McHale had added Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell before the
season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Easy, Rider: Portland's Isaiah Rider created some
bulletin-board material because of his strong words on the eve of
the Blazers' series with the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phoenix can't guard us, but they can put the ball in the
basket,'' Rider said.
</P>
<P>
   Suns center Joe Kleine replied: ``That's kind of funny that
Isaiah Rider is talking about defense. Instead of worrying about
our defense, he should worry about what time their shoot-around
is.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Goggle-gate: Speaking of the Suns, keep an eye on Rex Chapman
to see if he's wearing his $300 goggles that are protecting a
fractured right eye socket.
</P>
<P>
   After the Suns' final practice before departing for Portland on
Thursday, Chapman showed disgust for the goggles. When assistant
coach Frank Johnson handed Chapman the goggles afterward, Chapman
dropped them to the floor, stomped on them, kicked them across the
court and continued his conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The goggles remained on the floor, in two pieces, long after
Chapman was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Goggle-gate began at the beginning of the second half in the
Suns' game with Minnesota. When Chapman took the floor, he left the
goggles on the press table. Suns coach Danny Ainge picked them up
and gave them to Chapman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wear them, please,'' Ainge said. But Chapman refused and Ainge
immediately pulled Chapman from the lineup. &QL; 
TOP 10 AND NO. 29 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Utah: All three games with Sacramento were decided in
overtime. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. San Antonio: Tim Duncan _ not David Robinson _ can lead Spurs
to finals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. Miami: Odds of fight-free postseason for Heat: 1,000-1. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4. Indiana: The Davis duo (and their elbows) is what teams dread
in playoffs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5. Lakers: Glen Rice can stay as long as he scores 40 a game. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   6. Portland: Congrats on regular season, now go get eliminated. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   7. Orlando: Chuck Daly was hoping to play Milwaukee instead of
Philly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   8. Houston: Rockets not so cocky about facing Lakers after all. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   9. Atlanta: Hawks led NBA in defense, but Steve Smith needs to
stay healthy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   10. Detroit: Loy Vaught, Bison Dele didn't fuel this playoff
run. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No. 29 Clippers: At least Vancouver plays in its own arena.
</P>
<P>
   __ Sign of the times: Heat forward Mark Strickland became the
third victim to suffer a broken nose this season from Hawks center
Dikembe Mutombo. The other casualties were New Jersey's Jayson
Williams and Boston's Vitaly Potapenko.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland, who received an elbow from Mutombo, was actually
called for a foul on the play.
</P>
<P>
   Mutombo also elbowed Knicks guard Chris Childs in the mouth,
knocking out a tooth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way he plays, he plays with his arms above,'' Heat
coach Pat Riley said. ``It was just a freak thing.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Rumor of the Week: The Seattle SuperSonics are getting ready
for a major purge of their roster. Hersey Hawkins and Don MacLean
will be traded, and 36-year-old small forward Detlef Schrempf will
not return. Also being dumped are Olden Polynice, Aaron Williams,
Drew Barry and John Crotty.

 Web Ad Firms' IPOs Are a Hit
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Dan Fost &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Two companies that make their money in the growing field of Web
advertising cashed in on the public's appetite for Internet stocks
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Share prices soared for AdForce Inc., a Cupertino provider of
Internet advertising management services, and for Media Metrix
Inc., a New York firm that measures Web site traffic, on their
first day of trading.
</P>
<P>
   AdForce nearly doubled its asking price of $15, closing the day
at $29.94 as it sold 4.5 million shares on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   The sale, which was handled by Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, equaled a 23
percent stake in the company and raised $67.5 million for AdForce.
</P>
<P>
   Media Metrix shares soared 168 percent from $17 to $45.56. The
company sold 3 million shares on the Nasdaq market, or an 18
percent stake, raising $51 million. Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette
Securities Corp. handled the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The successful public offerings showed there's still life in the
market for Internet stocks, even after Comps.com, a San Diego
online real estate firm, fizzled in its stock market debut.
Comps.com, which went public on Wednesday at $15 per share, closed
yesterday at $13.75.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, another Internet advertising firm, San
Francisco's Flycast Communications, kept boosting its opening
price, but hasn't seen its stock jump much since then. It opened
Wednesday at $25 and closed yesterday at $26.25.
</P>
<P>
   These stocks hit the market the same week a report came out
showing that Web advertising has eclipsed billboards and taxi tops.
U.S. spending on Web banner ads, site sponsorships and e-mail
marketing more than doubled in 1998 to $1.92 billion _ trumping the
$1.5 billion spent on outdoor advertising, according to a study by
the Internet Advertising Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Internet ad spending could grow to $7.7 billion by 2002,
according to estimates in AdForce's filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Internet advertising has skeptics who note that very
few people actually click on banner ads _ less than half of 1
percent of Web users, according to NetRatings _ the new and dynamic
nature of the medium has many people excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``The landscape is shifting very quickly with this whole new
medium that provides interactive capabilities on an impressive
scale,'' said Greg Vogel, an Internet analyst with NationsBanc
Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies on the Internet can personally interact with you and
do targeted marketing,'' Vogel said. ``That's hugely powerful.
That's not a capability that was possible in the past. You have a
host of technologies and companies that are leveraging this new
model.''
</P>
<P>
   Both AdForce and Media Metrix find themselves in competitive
markets.
</P>
<P>
   AdForce competes with DoubleClick, Engage and NetGravity. Those
firms provide the technology that lets advertisers track Web
surfers' behavior online.
</P>
<P>
   A site such as Yahoo, for instance, could use ad management
technology to see that a Web user had just visited ESPN's Web site
_ and then post an ad for sporting goods just for that user.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the beauty of the Net,'' said Michael Tchong, editor of
Iconocast, an Internet marketing newsletter in San Francisco. ``You
can target much more richly than traditional media.''
</P>
<P>
   Media Metrix is the leading provider of crucial data showing
who's visiting what Web sites, Tchong said, but it too faces stiff
competition. The biggest challenge will come from Nielsen Media,
the leading provider of television-audience measurement services,
which formed a strategic relationship in October with San Jose's
NetRatings Inc. to provide Internet audience measurement services.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Tchong said, PC Data of Reston, Va., has also
started a similar service called AtPCData.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Net firms, neither AdForce nor Media Metrix are
profitable. AdForce lost $5 million on revenue of $3.2 million in
the first quarter of this year, compared with a loss of $2.6
million on revenue of $414,000 in the first quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   Media Metrix lost $7.5 million on revenue of $6.3 million last
year, compared with a loss of $4.9 million on revenue of $3.2
million in 1997. It merged with its chief competitor, Atlanta's
Relevant Knowledge, in November. On a pro forma basis, as if the
companies had been merged for the full year, the company lost $16.2
million on revenue of $8.1 million in 1998.

ANALYSIS: MOSCOW RETURNS TO THE HEAD TABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ While NATO leaders congratulated themselves on Thursday
for nudging Russia over to their side in the search for a
diplomatic settlement in Kosovo, Russian diplomats took another
view, claiming a small but significant victory in their monthlong
attempt to mediate a peace.
</P>
<P>
   Seen from Moscow, the document signed in Bonn, Germany, on
Thursday by the foreign ministers of Russia and the Group of Seven
industrial countries had the ring of a compromise, a classic
example of diplomatic give and take.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of some Russian analysts, the give came mostly from
the six NATO partners who for the first time opened the door to a
settlement brokered by the U.N. Security Council, where Russia
holds the power to veto. In Moscow's view, the council should play
the leading role in solving the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can speak about quite a substantial success for Russian
diplomacy,'' said Sergei Rogov, director of Moscow's USA and Canada
Institute. ``We were alone against seven Western countries.''
</P>
<P>
   No one here was touting the Bonn agreement as a breakthrough.
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov called it ``a step in the right
direction.'' Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russia's special Balkans envoy,
who sets off Saturday on his third mission to Belgrade, Yugoslavia,
and other capitals, talked only of ``progress.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Russia, the significance of the agreement lay in the
fact that for the first time since NATO began its bombing of
Yugoslavia, Moscow's place at the head table of the world's leading
powers has been reaffirmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at this whole story as an effort by NATO to
establish itself as the dominant player, deciding questions of war
and peace, and deciding them without Russia, we can already
conclude that this effort has failed,'' Rogov said.
</P>
<P>
   When NATO launched its first attack against Yugoslavia on March
24, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, then en route to Washington,
turned his plane around over the Atlantic in a move that signaled
the depth of Russian fury at being ignored and shut out.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by a domestic public opinion that is united against the
air raids on a traditional Russian ally, and by a Communist-led
opposition that blames the West for Russia's weakness, President
Boris Yeltsin has had little room for diplomatic maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   But even against a backdrop of saber-rattling by its top
military leaders, Russia began revving up its diplomatic efforts in
early April, first at a meeting in Oslo, Norway, between Ivanov and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and then with Chernomyrdin's
shuttle diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the leader of the Communist Party, Gennadi Zyuganov,
criticized the government's diplomatic overtures in the Balkans. He
accused Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin of ``silently betraying and
selling Yugoslavia the way they sold and betrayed the united
country, the Russian economy, friends, history, culture and
traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   By putting his signature on the Bonn document, Ivanov _ once one
of the loudest voices in the Moscow chorus condemning NATO as a
criminal aggressor _ signaled Russia's determination to be part of
the solution to a crisis that had thrown its relations with the
West into a freeze almost reminiscent of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement signed on Thursday will dash any hopes that
Belgrade may have had of drawing Russia into its war with NATO,
commentators here agreed. But some argued that by drawing the
United Nations into any future peace settlement, Moscow has helped
give President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia a way out of the
conflict, if he chooses to accept it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the final analysis, this is not our war,'' noted Maksim
Yusin, a Balkans expert at the newspaper Izvestia, ``and the peace
will be decided between NATO and the Serbs.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With its broadly stated goals, and flimsily worded proposals,
the Bonn document raises more problems than it solves. Its success
will lie in details that have yet to be hammered out, probably in a
Security Council resolution that promises to be the focus of the
next round of intense international diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's chief concession _ first touted by President Clinton _
lay in its agreement to join in an international peacekeeping
presence in Kosovo. But as several analysts noted, Russia had
already dropped broad hints of its willingness to allow and to take
part in such a force under U.N. auspices with Yugoslavia's consent.
</P>
<P>
   ``An international presence in Kosovo is out of the question
without the consent of Yugoslav leaders,'' Chernomyrdin said flatly
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the Russian view, the West's concessions came in the
agreement's acceptance of a U.N. framework for both the
peacekeeping force and for an ``interim administration'' for
Kosovo. ``The four-letter word NATO is not even mentioned,'' Rogov
said.
</P>
<P>
   That NATO will insist on playing a key role in keeping the peace
is accepted here as one of many issues still to be negotiated. One
option that some here think might be accepted by Belgrade would
involve troops from NATO countries that have not taken part in the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have already signaled their intention to step up
the pace of negotiations, seeking out new partners in the search
for a settlement, including perhaps Ibrahim Rugova, the Kosovar
Albanian leader now in Rome. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott, who came from Washington last month for talks on Kosovo,
is to return here next week.

JONES LAWYERS WANT $496,000 FROM CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (Eds: See also STARR-STEELE) 
(mk) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawyers for Paula Jones told a federal judge in
Arkansas Friday that President Clinton owed them more than $496,000
as a result of extra work they say they were forced to perform
because of his dishonest testimony in her sexual misconduct case.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bennett, Clinton's lawyer, immediately denounced the
request as ``unreasonable, greedy and contrary to law,'' and said
he would challenge the amount before the judge, Susan Webber
Wright.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bennett said in a letter to Ms. Wright that
the president would not challenge her order of April 12 holding him
in civil contempt. Ms. Wright ruled then that the president lied in
a deposition in the Jones case when, on Jan. 17, 1998, he denied
having engaged in sex with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   It was this ruling that led to the filing by the Jones lawyers
Friday. In holding Clinton in civil contempt _ the first time a
president had ever been held in contempt of court _ Ms. Wright
ordered that he pay the Jones lawyers ``any reasonable expenses,''
including legal fees, incurred because of his false testimony. In
addition, she ordered him to reimburse the court $1,202, her
expenses for traveling from Little Rock, Ark., to Washington on
Jan. 17 to preside over the deposition.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the Jones lawyers' request for reimbursement and the
swift reaction of the president's chief personal lawyer insures
that the remnants of a case that vexed the Clinton White House for
years and ultimately led to a presidential impeachment drama will
not be put to rest soon.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wright dismissed Mrs. Jones' lawsuit in April 1998, saying
that even if there was truth in her accusation _ that Clinton
propositioned her in a Little Rock hotel room when he was governor
of Arkansas and she a state clerical employee _ his act did not
amount to sexual harassment or a violation of her constitutional
rights.
</P>
<P>
   In their appeal of that dismissal, Mrs. Jones' lawyers argued
that Clinton had lied in denying a sexual relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky. They cited his admission of last August that in fact he
had had a relationship with her that he described as
``inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the appeals court could rule, the president settled the
case by giving Mrs. Jones $850,000, of which she received about
$200,000, with the rest going to her various lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   In filings Friday, the Dallas law firm of Rader, Campbell,
Fisher &AMP; Pyke, which represented Mrs. Jones, submitted fees and
expenses totaling $437,825, while the Rutherford Institute of
Charlottesville, Va., which also provided representation, said it
was owed $58,533.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas firm said in its submission that Clinton's denial of
an intimate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky ``became one of the most
important aspects'' of its case and involved the work of six
lawyers and two paralegals over many hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton's lies at his deposition as well as the lies in his
earlier answers to written interrogatories affected our work in
every step of the case from that point forward,'' the Dallas
lawyers asserted.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   They asked for more than $97,000 in fees and expenses that
accrued even before the Jan. 18 deposition, saying the president's
dishonesty began on Dec. 23, 1997, when he answered ``none'' to a
written question asking whether there were any female employees of
the federal government with whom he had had sexual relations.
</P>
<P>
   The expense claim also appears to demand that Clinton pay the
Dallas lawyers for their time spent with Linda Tripp, Ms.
Lewinsky's onetime friend, who became an informer for both the
Jones lawyers and Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel. The claim
includes a charge of $1,500 for 10 hours of work by one of the
Dallas lawyers, T. Wesley Holmes, on Jan. 16, 1998. That appears to
be a meeting with Mrs. Tripp, who was secretly interviewed the
night before the Clinton deposition.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the deposition, Clinton was so stunned by the
detailed knowledge implicit in the Jones lawyers' questions that he
canceled evening plans and summoned his personal secretary, Betty
Currie, to see him the next day, when he discussed with her his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In their filing Friday, the Dallas lawyers said the task of
selecting which of their expenses were attributable to Clinton's
false answers about Ms. Lewinsky had been extremely onerous. In
fact, included in their claim is a bill for more than $12,000 to
pay the costs of trying to figure out how much they were owed.
</P>
<P>
   The expenses range from a $12 claim, for a $60-an-hour paralegal
to read The New York Times and The Washington Post for articles
about Ms. Lewinsky, to lawyers' fees of $150 to $225 an hour for
preparation of legal documents. The Dallas lawyers said their fees
were especially reasonable in comparison with the hourly rate
charged by Bennett, which they estimated at $450.
</P>
<P>
   As for the president's decision not to challenge the contempt
order, some legal scholars had said they thought he would have
strong grounds to fight it. But White House officials said the main
reason for not doing so was to be rid of the case as quickly as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   They also said they had expected that the Jones legal fees in
connection with the contempt order would be about $100,000.

CONFLICTING REPORTS OF CASUALTIES AT CHINESE EMBASSY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Smoke was streaming from the Chinese
Embassy here early Saturday morning, and a gaping hole could be
seen in one side half an hour after bombs struck the modern
six-story building, setting it ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 firetrucks surrounded the embassy, their headlights
and red-and-blue emergency lights illumining its walls _ and a red
Chinese flag still flying in its forecourt. Firefighters in
fluorescent uniforms clambered in and out of smashed windows.
</P>
<P>
   There were conflicting reports of casualties. Talking to
reporters outside the damaged building, a Yugoslav government
official, Goran Matic, said that 26 Chinese were inside when the
bomb fell, and that all had been evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   He said that although some had been taken to hospitals, no one
was seriously injured. But later Nebojsa Vujovic, the Foreign
Ministry spokesman, told reporters that there had been deaths and
injuries. Later Saturday morning, a Yugoslav news agency, Beta,
reported one death.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials attributed the bombing to NATO, which had no
immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're crazy, those NATO pilots,'' Matic said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the night, NATO bombers again cut electricity
throughout the city, plunging it into darkness on a cloudless and
moonless night. Several bombs struck in the vicinity of the
Interior and Defense Ministries, both of which have been hit
before. Large fires could be seen from the direction of the
ministries.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese Embassy, in a residential area called Novi Belgrad,
was hit around midnight. Beta, said four explosions were heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a criminal act, they can see this is a completely
residential area,'' a Chinese diplomat told Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   The military commentator of the Studio B radio station termed
the attack unprecedented. He said the embassy had been attacked
intentionally because of China's support in the U.N. Security
Council for Belgrade's position.
</P>
<P>
   The explosions also blew out the windows in an apartment
building across the street from the embassy. The pavement was
strewn with shattered glass, and people could be seen in their
homes clearing the rubble to the light of candles.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour after the bombing of the embassy, two blasts were
heard toward the center of Belgrade, followed by an orange flash.
The fire engines raced off, leaving the smoking embassy in the
dark.

AMONG ALLIES, DOUBTS AND DISAGREEMENT ON OIL EMBARGO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The bark of NATO's planned naval blockade of
oil deliveries to Yugoslavia may be worse than its bite, allied
diplomats said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the legal charge against the blockade that was wanted by
NATO's U.S. commander, France has apparently persuaded most allies
that there is no basis in international law for allied warships to
challenge ships of countries that have not declared war against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the French argue, there is no U.N. embargo against
Yugoslavia barring fuel shipments. They have rejected U.S.
arguments that a ban on importing war materials provides
justification enough.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, allied political authorities sent instructions
Friday to their military colleagues at NATO headquarters to devise
a different kind of ``visit and search'' system, one that would use
psychology rather than force to dissuade merchant ships from trying
to run oil, gasoline, and other fuels into Bar, the main Yugoslav
port in Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro, which with Serbia is a constituent part of
Yugoslavia, has opposed President Slobodan Milosevic's operations
against Albanian civilians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   This week, officials in Bar said Milosevic had ordered the navy
to block shipping into the port.
</P>
<P>
   But allied commanders say ships flying flags of opportunity
occasionally do make runs into Bar, so the NATO commander, Gen.
Wesley Clark, wanted a full-fledged blockade. Instead, the French
suggest, NATO ships should be empowered to board ships of allied
and European countries that have declared a ban on fuel shipments
into Yugoslavia, just to check that any vessels heading into Bar
are carrying no fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans argued that this was ridiculous, because we'd
only be checking on shipping that had already agreed not to bring
in fuel,'' one European diplomat reported.
</P>
<P>
   But the French contend that a voluntary or cooperative blockade
is better than none at all and that getting an allied naval
inspection system up and running could scare or shame would-be
violators out of trying to run the blockade.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said Friday that the 15-nation
European Union had proposed that ships flying its flags could agree
to be boarded by naval inspectors from fellow European countries.
Other countries that had decided to stop oil shipments would be
invited to do so as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intention is to have an effective, comprehensive visit and
search regime,'' he said. ``We're off to a good start.''
</P>
<P>
   Greece was insisting, one allied diplomat in Brussels said
Friday that none of its merchant ships could be boarded by Turkish
naval inspectors. Greece and Turkey are united both by membership
in NATO and by a cordial dislike of one another.
</P>
<P>
   Allied diplomats said Friday they expected that the new system,
if approved, could go into effect as early as next week.

LEON HESS WANTED JETS SOLD AFTER HIS DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: See also OBIT-HESS)  
(DW) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leon Hess, who died Friday at the age of 85, told other National
Football League owners and officials that he wanted the Jets to be
sold upon his death, and that he planned to specify that wish in
his will.
</P>
<P>
   Three team owners, three league officials and a Hess business
associate, none willing to be identified by name in print, gave
similar descriptions Friday of conversations they had had with Hess
concerning the future of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning about two years ago and as recently as seven months
ago, they said, Hess systematically approached some of his
contemporaries and confided that for a variety of reasons he was
reluctant to leave the responsibility of running the team to his
heirs, which would include his son, John, and his daughters,
Marlene Hess and Connie Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Hess, the owners and league officials said, also did not want to
burden his heirs with a decision over whether to sell or retain the
team, something that a mandate to sell the team would avoid.
</P>
<P>
   If the Hess family sells, the Jets are expected to fetch at
least $500 million, sports finance experts said. The price reflects
the value of an NFL franchise in the New York market that will
receive an average of $70 million annually from the league's
network television contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the ultimate ego play for a wealthy New York
investor,'' said Marc Ganis, the president of Sportscorp Ltd., a
Chicago consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Among the potential bidders are Cablevision's Dolan family,
which was recently spurned in negotiations to purchase a
controlling interest in the Yankees; Donald Trump, who owned the
New Jersey Generals of the U.S. Football League in the 1980s; the
New York Mets co-owner Nelson Doubleday, and the New Jersey Devils
owner John McMullen.
</P>
<P>
   John Hess, who took control of the family's oil business in
1995, has not had an active role in the operations of the team and
holds no official title in the organization. One NFL owner who
spoke with Leon Hess on the subject said the longtime Jets owner
wanted someone with a passion for football to be running the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   A friend and associate said Hess also wanted to spare his family
the angst and disappointment he experienced during the many
turbulent, controversial and losing Jets seasons he owned the team.
</P>
<P>
   A league official said Friday he believed that Hess' resolve to
have the team sold after his death might have been strengthened
after he witnessed the rancorous dispute that enveloped the
Washington Redskins in the aftermath of the owner Jack Kent Cooke's
death.
</P>
<P>
   One NFL owner said Friday that Hess indicated he was planning to
make the sale of the Jets a priority in his will _ the first asset
to be handled by the executor of his estate.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Gutman, the Jets' president, said the team would have no
comment on its future. ``We're focusing on Leon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A change of Jets ownership could disturb the reign of Bill
Parcells, who acts as the team's football czar as both head coach
and general manager. Hess was known for letting his coaches and
executives plot the team's football course without interference
from ownership.
</P>
<P>
   A new Jets owner, especially if he has a hands-on management
approach or enjoys the spotlight, might not sit as well with the
opinionated Parcells, who left the New England Patriots two years
ago in part because he disdained the splashy, assertive style of
the team owner Robert Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Forbes magazine valued the Jets at $259 million, but
they are now worth at least $300 million. A potential buyer would
pay a premium over the basic value of the team. ``With Bill
Parcells there, the Jets are a premier team in a major market,''
said Dean Bonham, a Denver-based sports consultant.
</P>
<P>
   The price would be higher if not for the Jets' lease at Giants
Stadium, which ends after the 2007 season and places them in the
``lower third of NFL teams in stadium revenues,'' said Michael
Ozanian of Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Teams with sweetheart leases in new stadiums, like the Cleveland
Browns, or those that own their stadiums, like the Redskins, garner
large sums from luxury suites, club seats, parking and concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Those revenues were reflected in the $530 million paid for the
Browns last year and the $800 million expected to be paid for the
Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Milstein, the New York real estate magnate, withdrew his
$800 million bid for the Redskins last month because owners were
concerned about the high level of debt he was using. His bid
created enough controversy to raise doubt about whether he would
bid for the Jets. A spokesman for Milstein had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Dolan, the chairman of Cablevision, which owns the New
York Knicks and New York Rangers, tried to buy the New York Yankees
and has shown interest in acquiring the Mets. On his own, Dolan
also tried to buy the Browns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hess was one of the great gentlemen of sports and industry,''
Dolan said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The newly merged YankeeNets company could also be a candidate,
but the deal that brought them together has not been closed.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever price the Jets sell for, the Hess family will have to
pay 55 percent of the sum in federal estate tax. If the family
keeps the team, it could argue that the basic value of the Jets is
less than a sale price and pay less in taxes, although the tax rate
would remain the same, said Cheryl Hader, a partner at the
Manhattan law firm Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton &AMP; Garrison.
</P>
<P>
   Hess' original investment in the team was $250,000 in 1963, when
he and four other partners salvaged the failed franchise then known
as the Titans. In 1984 Hess bought out his last remaining partner.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Jets are now a popular, division-winning team and
Super Bowl contender, there were many seasons when they lost far
more games than they won. A league official revealed Friday that
Hess routinely bought thousands of tickets to Jets home games at
Giants Stadium so that they would not be blacked out on local
television, as league laws dictate for games not sold out. Hess
would donate the tickets to charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL is not as decent, it is not as fair, it is not as good
as it was yesterday because of the passing of Leon,'' said Art
Modell, the Baltimore Ravens' owner, who along with the Giants
co-owner Wellington Mara is one of the league's most veteran
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   At the Jets offices in Hempstead, N.Y., Gutman said he was
overwhelmed by the expressions of sorrow in the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you fell into Leon's life, you were very lucky,'' Gutman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells issued a statement that read: ``I'm saddened by the
loss of this great man who had such a quiet dignity. His word was
always good enough for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jets players remembered Hess' annual Thanksgiving Day addresses
to the team, and that Hess was there to greet the team as it
returned from its American Football Conference championship game
defeat in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure nobody will forget him standing there when we came
off the plane,'' wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson said. ``He was
thanking us. That meant a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Giants general manager George Young, who is now a
league executive, recalled how Hess refused to raise ticket prices
because his team was not winning. Until recently, the Jets usually
had the lowest average ticket price in the NFL. Last season, the
$35.50 average ticket price ranked 24th, according to Team
Marketing Report, a Chicago publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anyone in the league who didn't like him,'' Young
said.

SPORTS COLUMN: BREATHLESS IN MIAMI ONCE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ The average plant manager or chief operating
officer sticks his or her head into a bucket of ice water and is
immediately suspected of having spent too much time in the sun. Pat
Riley dunks himself and _ glug, glug _ he is lauded once again for
masterfully motivating his Miami Heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can envision that happening,'' Jeff Van Gundy said Friday,
before leaving for Miami, where his Knicks begin another tractor
pull of a playoff series Saturday against the top-seeded Macho Men
of Riley. ``I've been inside that locker room.''
</P>
<P>
   He meant inside Riley's notorious chamber of pre-game challenges
to his players' manhood, where this season Riley reportedly taunted
the Heat with pink panties on one occasion and went face down into
the bucket on another. Reluctantly putting aside the gender polemic
of the former, Riley apparently emerged from the latter to declare:
``You've got to want to win as much as you want to breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   We may shake our heads at the preposterousness of this, but, as
we live and breathe, Riley's next collection of inspirational
urgings, just like the last one, will probably wind up on the
best-seller list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaches do what works for them, what their personality is,''
Van Gundy said. ``That's not in mine, but when Pat was coaching
here, I saw him walk into the locker room in a pair of cleats, as
if to say, `We're coming in with our spikes up.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Van Gundy's favorite you-had-to-be-there
reminiscence of Riley's New York years, a pre-game locker room in a
playoff series against Chicago. Riley told the story of the frog
that agreed to carry the scorpion across the water as long as the
scorpion promised not to sting. After the inevitable, as they were
both sinking, the frog wanted to know what the point of the sting
had been.
</P>
<P>
   `` `I'm a scorpion, and that's what scorpions do,''' Riley said.
And to his team: ``We are Knicks, and what Knicks do is sting
Bulls.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley then turned to Dick Harter, another assistant, and asked
if he had something to add. Harter suggested that the first time
B.J. Armstrong pushed his mouth guard out of his mouth with his
tongue, as he often did during stoppages of play, someone seize the
opportunity to shove it down his throat.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Oakley stood up to volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'm talking about!'' Oakley yelled as he led the
frothing Knicks out the door.
</P>
<P>
   While Van Gundy and the Knicks were massing at the Miami border
Friday, the predictably stupid war metaphors were being applied to
the third installment of the Knicks-Heat playoff trilogy. Both
coaches, conversely, expressed confidence that the principal
players finally understood the dire consequences of crossing what
we may call the Thorn Line, named for the man who dispenses fines
and suspensions for the National Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   One would think so, at least hope so. No one should hold his
breath, though, unless he plans to watch these games with his face
submerged in a glass water bucket. Riley and Van Gundy can talk all
they want about self-control, but their players have also been
getting an earful this week about fighting to the last gasp, spikes
up. That's what the Heat and Knicks do, even if it means they both
drown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to go down there with force,'' Van Gundy said,
borrowing again from his mentor's short list glossary of playoff
hardball.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to dispute Riley's 1990s regular-season success in
New York and Miami, beginning with a Knicks team Van Gundy fondly
remembered as nasty. Riley didn't invent physical playoff
basketball, but he surely heightened its bad intentions, and so it
is not unfair to point out that he is 0-for-the-decade in terms of
achieving his ultimate goal.
</P>
<P>
   Most people believe he won't win his first title sans Magic
Johnson this year either, despite bleeding every last victory out
of a team handicapped by injury and offensive inefficiency. With
Michael Jordan gone, the smart money is on the slick-passing and
skills-endowed teams from Indiana, San Antonio, Portland and Utah.
Riley won four titles in Los Angeles with Showtime, but when he
came east, the man behind the makeup turned out to be the street
tough from Schenectady, with his pack of cigarettes tucked under
his T-shirt sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   No team wins the championship holding its breath. This is, above
all, a game of movement, of accuracy, of flow. If the Knicks can
muster enough offense, execute in the fourth quarter, they could
again knock Riley out of the first round. They could dunk his
motivational mystique for good.

 &HT;    Explosives likely for sale, not use, officials believe
 &HT;    By A. Scharnhorst and Brian D. Crecente
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Federal investigators Friday were
looking for the origin of four bars of military C-4 explosives
found in a truck near Lantana on Thursday, but they said they may
never know where they came from.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Gregory Jeffreys and Andre Ruben Morse, both of Fort
Walton Beach, were arrested Thursday afternoon on federal
explosives charges after an anonymous caller told police the men
were carrying the material. The C-4 bars were wrapped in black
mylar and were not set to explode, said Dale Armstrong with the
West Palm Beach office of the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms. The men probably did not intend to use the material
themselves, Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears it's going to turn out just like other cases, where
people are in it for sale or trade for drugs,'' Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   This particular explosive is manufactured only for military use
and was probably stolen from a military installation, he said. The
wrapped bars still contained a lot number that might lead
authorities to the installation where they were stolen, but not
necessarily to the thieves, he said. The explosives could have been
traded on the black market for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we can zero in on where it came from,'' Armstrong said.
``It's going to be difficult, but not impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffreys and Morse were in U.S. District Court in Fort Pierce on
Friday morning to be formally charged, although details of the
charges were not made public. U.S. Magistrate Frank Lynch sealed
the complaints against the two men at the request of Assistant
United States Attorney Diana Acosta.
</P>
<P>
   The men, who face up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine,
were ordered held without bond.

   DOW SOARS TO RECORD AS INFLATION FEARS RECEDE
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average climbed to yet another record
high after the closely watched employment report for April soothed
Wall Street's fears about inflation. The Dow closed up 84.77
points, or eight-tenths of 1 percent, to 11,031.59. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index rose 12.95 points, or 1 percent, to 1,345,
and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index jumped 31.34
points, or 1.27 percent, to 2,503.62.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department reported that the number of workers on the
nation's payrolls outside the farm sector increased by 234,000 in
April and the unemployment rate hovered close to a 30-year low at
4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury bond prices declined as traders fretted that next
week's quarterly government debt sales will overwhelm demand. The
yield on the 30-year bond rose to 5.81 percent, from 5.78 percent
on Thursday.

   UNEMPLOYMENT RISES IN GERMANY
</P>
<P>
   Germany reported an unexpected rise in unemployment, with the
seasonally adjusted jobless rate edging up to 10.7 percent in April
from 10.6 percent in March. Although the change was small, it
surprised economists who had been expecting either no change or a
continuation of recent declines. It also pointed to renewed
pressure on Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who has come under
widespread criticism from industrialists for what they call his
listless economic program.

 &HT;    Clinton stumps for money in Texas
 &HT;    EDS: Will update with quotes when Friday night speech ends.
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ President Clinton, raising money in a state that
has moved solidly into the other party's side of the political
ledger, rallied Democratic troops Friday night at a fund-raising
event at the home of a longtime friend.
</P>
<P>
   The event at the home of Roy Spence, owner of an advertising
firm in Austin, was expected to raise between $250,000 and $350,000
for the Democratic National Committee. The money is earmarked for
the 2000 campaigns. The gathering followed a $450,000 fund-raising
luncheon for about four dozen people held earlier in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Current polls show Texas Gov. George W. Bush could be atop the
GOP national ticket, possibly squaring off against Al Gore,
Clinton's vice president and frontrunner for the Democratic
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has always been able to draw crowds and money in Texas,
a state he failed to carry in his 1992 and 1996 elections. In 1992,
running against Houstonian George Bush, then the incumbent
president, Clinton made little effort to carry Texas. Again in
1996, when it became clear that the Democrats' chances of carrying
statewide races had dwindled to near zero, Clinton made little
effort in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Spence's friendship with Clinton dates back to their 1972
efforts on behalf of George McGovern, another Democratic
presidential candidate who had little chance of winning Texas'
electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   Money raised in Texas on Friday will go the Democratic Party's
national coffers for an election cycle that will be crucial to
Texas Democrats. As a result of a 1998 sweep led by Bush, the GOP
now holds all statewide offices in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, when Bush may try for president, the only major
statewide race on the Texas ballot will be Sen. Kay Bailey
Hutchison's likely re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A strong showing by Bush and Hutchison could carry the ballot
and give the Republicans their best-ever chance of wresting control
of the Texas Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arriving in Austin, the Democratic stronghold in an
otherwise Republican state, President Clinton urged Texas
legislators to approve a bill that would stiffen the penalties for
crimes motivated by bias against a person's race, religion,
national origin or sexual preference.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, as the bill became stalled in legislative
process, Bush has declined to take a position, opting to say
nothing more than he'd look at it if it hits his desk.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said there's no reason for anyone to be unclear about
the right thing to do. He signaled his support for the bill shortly
after climbing off Air Force One and hugging the daughter of James
Byrd Jr., the Jasper man who was dragged to his death behind a
pickup truck occupied by three alleged white supremacists.
</P>
<P>
   On the airport podium, Clinton invoked the name of past Texans
who worked for civil rights causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I'm here today I cannot help noting that the work of
Lyndon Johnson and Barbara Jordan is being carried on today here in
Austin by state legislators who are trying to pass hate crime
legislation in the name of James Byrd,'' said Clinton, drawing
applause.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Senfronia Thompson (D-Houston) filed the hate crimes
legislation in memory of Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved the bill last week, but it is still pending
in the Senate. Bush has said he is undecided on whether to support
the hate crimes measure but that he opposes special rights based on
sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, speaking on the House floor moments after Clinton made
his remarks, said she was ``honored'' by his support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very honored and very happy that he sees the importance
of this significant piece of legislation,'' Thompson said. ``I just
regret that our governor has not shown that kind of leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton planned to spend the night at an Austin hotel before
heading to Oklahoma on Saturday to look at tornado damage.

 &HT;    EDS: 1ST UPDATE: CORRECTS age of The Citadel in 1st graf; TODAY
is SATURDAY in lede.
 &HT;    First woman cadet to graduate from Citadel
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ All alone, Nancy Mace strides across the
grassy parade ground. Eyes straight ahead, her slender arms
swinging in gentle cadence, the 21-year-old woman in gray will
march into history today as the first woman to graduate from The
Citadel in its 156-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Mace will complete the arduous journey started by Shannon
Faulkner. A federal judge ordered Faulkner admitted to the corps of
cadets in August 1995, but she dropped out within days, saying she
felt isolated and exhausted by her 2 1/2-year legal fight to become
the school's first female cadet.
</P>
<P>
   Mace's isolation at noontime Thursday was fleeting, and that
illustrates the progress by the state-supported military college in
assimilating women. Their numbers are growing _ 41 among 1,800
cadets this year _ and there could be 100 next school year.
</P>
<P>
   Mace crossed the parade grounds from her barracks to Mark Clark
Hall, where members of the state-supported military college's Board
of Visitors congratulated the cadet captain with a 3.67 GPA in
business administration.
</P>
<P>
   That same board of prominent alumni had fought Faulkner's
assault on single-gender education. Now in embracing women, they're
making it possible for female cadets to tap into the influential
network of alumni who've provided jobs and contacts to male cadets
for generations. In court, Faulkner's lawyers argued that by
denying women admission, the school was depriving them of such
contacts. Mace is going to work in Charlotte as an analyst for
Andersen Consulting, a job she said she found during a job fair,
not from a Citadel alumnus. But she said, ``The alumni network is
out there alive and well. There are a large number of individuals
who are ready to help me.''
</P>
<P>
   Masculine history pervades The Citadel, from a plaque honoring
the ``Citadel men'' who died during War II to gold-framed portraits
of the school's war heroes dating back to the Civil War. But among
steps intended to make the school inclusive of women, the
Association of Citadel Men changed its name to the Association of
Citadel Alumni.
</P>
<P>
   Alumni support has been particularly crucial for 21-year-old
Petra Lovetinska. The Czech national enrolled in the Citadel in
August 1996 with Mace and with two other women who quit after they
alleged cadets had hazed and sexually harassed them. The college
settled with Kim Messer; it still faces a federal lawsuit by Jeanie
Mentavlos.
</P>
<P>
   Citadel alumni in Washington, where Lovetinska's father worked
for the Czech Embassy, are helping pay her tuition. During her
grueling freshman year, Lovetinska said she received letters from
an alumnus who encouraged her to stick it out.
</P>
<P>
   Now alumni are helping Lovetinska, in the United States on a
student visa, to secure a work permit so she can remain in this
country when she graduates a year from now. This fall, she will be
the executive officer of one of the corps' four battalions, as well
as commander of the cadre of upperclassmen who train the freshman
athletes. Mace, from Goose Creek, S.C., arrived at The Citadel with
community college credits, allowing her history-making early
graduation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had hand-picked a woman to be the first to graduate
from The Citadel, they couldn't have done better than Nancy,'' said
Charleston talk radio host Dan Moon.
</P>
<P>
   When Faulkner enrolled 3 1/2 years ago, callers to Moon's show
hurled ugly remarks at the 20-year-old from Powdersville, S.C. Moon
called Faulkner, who was overweight and poorly conditioned, a
``toadfish,'' a remark he said he now regrets but defends as
reflective of public sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was caught up three years ago in the sentiment of a lot of
people who asked, `Why can't they just leave the place alone?'''
Moon said.
</P>
<P>
   The Citadel's Board of Visitors abandoned its legal fight in
June 1996, after the U.S. Supreme Court declared that Virginia
Military Institute's single-gender policy was unconstitutional. On
May 15, two women _ Melissa Graham of Burleson, Texas, and
Chih-Yuan Ho of China _ are scheduled to graduate from the
Lexington, Va., state-supported college.
</P>
<P>
   Women haven't yet achieved universal acceptance among cadets and
alumni at either VMI or The Citadel, the South's two most prominent
military colleges. A few Citadel alumni are so disgusted by the
admittance of women that they've written off the school. Others are
still upset at orders to end hazing issued by Citadel President
John Grinalds and retired Army Brig. Gen. Emory Mace, Mace's father
who became commandant of cadets in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell Week'' _ knobs' grueling introduction to a lowly, at
times miserable, freshman year _ has been eliminated. The
administration now stresses leadership development among cadets.
When Mace crosses the stage today to receive her diploma, she's not
certain some cadets won't hiss at her, as some did during last
fall's senior ring ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be so thankful to get my diploma from The Citadel,''
Mace said, ``I could care less about anything else, really.''

   TIRANA, Albania _ After nearly 25,000 Kosovo refugees flooded
into Macedonia earlier this week, the border fell eerily silent
Friday and refugee officials said they feared that Yugoslav forces
were expelling ethnic Albanians from their homes but barring them
from fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonian border guards accused of closing the border on
Thursday appeared to no longer be blocking crossings, officials
from the office of the U.N. high commissioner for refugees said.
But the thousands of refugees believed to be heading toward
Macedonia earlier this week, as well as 1,000 refugees reportedly
forced back into Kosovo by Macedonian police on Wednesday, have
simply vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Ghedini, a spokeswoman for the refugee agency, said in a
telephone interview from Macedonia that the silence along the
border was particularly unnerving. The refugees arriving earlier
this week from northern Kosovo, including some children, were
suffering from wounds, malnutrition and exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're extremely alarmed,'' she said. ``Thousands of people
from across Kosovo were trying to get out and now they're gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the exodus from Kosovo, the flow of refugees arriving
in neighboring countries has shifted from as many as 40,000 in a
single day to none at all. At times, Yugoslav officials have closed
the border and forced thousands of refugees back into Kosovo with
no explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats have said that the Yugoslavs may want to keep
some ethnic Albanians in Kosovo as protection against NATO bombing.
They also may need to clear roads at times to quickly move military
convoys.
</P>
<P>
   The current lull is particularly alarming, Ms. Ghedini said,
because reports by some of the people who flooded over the border
between Monday and Wednesday indicated that Yugoslav forces had
recently intensified their efforts to expel ethnic Albanians in
three towns in Kosovo. Some of the refugees who came across the
border were particularly weak, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees arriving from Podujevo in northern Kosovo said they had
spent weeks hiding in the woods before food shortages and
indiscriminate Yugoslav shelling forced them to return to the town,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting lots of children with bullet and shrapnel
wounds,'' Ms. Ghedini said. ``They're in an extremely weakened
state.''
</P>
<P>
   The refugees also told aid workers that in Glogovac in Central
Kosovo, Yugoslav forces went from house to house on Sunday and
ordered all ethnic Albanians out. Ethnic Albanians were then
marched to buses that took them to Pristina, the provincial
capital. There, the refugees were loaded onto a special night train
that hauled them to the Macedonian border, the aid workers said.
Refugees recently arriving from Objilic, located just west of
Pristina in central Kosovo, said the Yugoslavs had stepped up
expulsions there, too.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the people turned back at the Macedonian border were
among 600 people who arrived in Albania Friday from Kosovo,
officials from the refugee agency said. A group of 360 people from
villages around Pristina and Mitrovica crossed into Albania on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees told aid officials that they were originally sent
by train to Macedonia, but Yugoslav border guards told them the
border was closed. Yugoslav officials then ordered the group to
return to Pristina where they were forced to board buses and pay
$65 each for a ride into exile, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Other refugees arriving in Albania reported that Yugoslav forces
are continuing to pursue Kosovar Albanian intellectuals. A group of
men arriving from the town of Prizren in southern Kosovo Friday
told aid workers that they had been abruptly picked up at their
offices and expelled directly into Albania, refugee agency
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The men, who tended to be educated professionals, said they were
forced out of the town with only the clothes they were wearing and
without being allowed to speak with their families. The officials
said similar attacks have been reported over the last week and
Yugoslav forces appear to be stripping the town of its educated
elite.

TOP GENERAL REQUESTS ARMS AT BORDER WITH CROATIA 
</HEADLINE>

 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hoping to widen the attack on Yugoslavia, NATO's
commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, has asked the Pentagon to position
additional long-range rocket batteries along Yugoslavia's borders,
including some in the territory of its arch-enemy Croatia, U.S. and
NATO officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has not yet approved Clark's request, though one
senior official said it was not expected to be a problem. But some
officials within the Pentagon and the Clinton administration fear
basing the rockets in Croatia could inflame Serb-Croat tensions.
</P>
<P>
   The rockets are another of NATO's efforts to broaden the scope
of the air raids against Yugoslavia, which continued for a 45th day
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen on Thursday ordered 176
additional aircraft to join the campaign, including 96 attack
fighters, and the Pentagon said still more would be on their way
soon. France announced Friday that it would send 22 more aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Once the latest squadrons arrive, NATO will have more than 1,100
aircraft committed in the Balkans, more than 800 of them American.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be in an even better position with these extra assets
to operate seven days a week, 24 hours a day,'' said NATO spokesman
Jamie Shea. ``It has never been so true that NATO never sleeps.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark requested the additional rocket batteries _ known as the
Army Tactical Missile System _ several weeks ago as part of his
strategy to cut down Yugoslavia's air defenses. The batteries fire
rockets with a range of about 100 miles and are designed to
immobilize anti-aircraft weapons or radar systems with fragmentary
shells.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has already sent a battalion of the long-range
rockets to the region. The batteries accompany the two dozen Apache
helicopters now in Albania readying themselves to join the attack.
The rockets often work in tandem with the Apaches, knocking out air
defenses moments before the helicopter gunships enter enemy
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Clark requested an additional battalion, the officials said. A
battalion includes three batteries that are able to fire nine
rockets each, as well as 300 soldiers to operate them.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that Clark's request did not specify an exact
location, but one area under consideration was the Dalmatian coast
of Croatia, south of Dubrovnik.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the rockets could cover much of Montenegro, the
junior republic in Yugoslavia and a pathway for NATO's air raids.
The Pentagon has also considered placing the batteries in Hungary
and Bosnia, where the United States and NATO have about 30,000
troops.

JUDGE DECLARES MISTRIAL IN STARR'S CASE AGAINST STEELE

<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. _ After jury members twice described themselves
as ``hopelessly deadlocked,'' a federal judge declared a mistrial
Friday in the obstruction of justice trial of Julie Hiatt Steele,
the Richmond, Va., woman who played a peripheral role in Kenneth
Starr's investigation of President Clinton. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The mistrial represents the second setback in a month to Starr's
office. In April, a jury in Little Rock, Ark., acquitted Susan
McDougal of one count of obstructing justice when she refused to
testify before a grand jury about the Clintons' Arkansas financial
dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ms. McDougal, Ms. Steele had attacked the motives and
tactics of Starr's prosecutors. The mistrial appeared to startle
members of the prosecution team, who seemed confident after the
defense abruptly rested its case on Thursday without calling Ms.
Steele, or any witnesses, to testify. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite more than eight hours of deliberations over two days,
the jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict on any of the four
charges of obstruction of justice and making false statements to
federal investigators stemming from what Kathleen Willey described
as Clinton's unwelcome advances in a White House encounter in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In a note to the judge late Friday afternoon, the jury foreman
wrote that they were ``hopelessly deadlocked'' and ``any further
deliberations will not change the outcome.'' U.S. District Judge
Claude M. Hilton announced that the foreman had underlined the
word, ``not,'' to emphasize the point. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I will then declare a mistrial in this case,'' Hilton
told the jurors, ``and we'll excuse you all.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Neither the foreman, nor any members of the seven-woman,
five-man jury, would talk about their deliberations as they left
the courthouse. Afterward, Ms. Steele, 52, beamed, telling
reporters, ``It's time to start my life again.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that she hoped it would be the last time that she
would have to have her photograph taken on the steps of a court
house. ``It's been a long, long road,'' Ms. Steele said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors declined to say whether they would seek a
retrial of Ms. Steele. And although they also refused to express
their feelings about the outcome, their expressions made it clear
that the mistrial was a deep disappointment. ``I'm proud of my
legal team and the job they did,'' said prosecutor David Barger. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Ms. Steele marked the first and only
criminal prosecution arising from Starr's lengthy investigation of
the president and his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The she-said, she-said case rested on the jurors' evaluation of
the truthfulness of Ms. Willey and Ms. Steele, whose differing
accounts of the 1993 episode discouraged Starr from sending the
Willey matter to the House of Representatives as part of his
impeachment referral.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors advanced the argument that Ms. Steele had been told
by Ms. Willey about her encounter with the president on Nov. 29,
1993, several hours after it allegedly occured. They said Ms.
Steele had lied when she refused to corroborate it to the grand
jury.
</P>
<P>
   But defense lawyers say that Ms. Steele did not hear about the
incident until March 1997, when Ms. Willey asked her friend to lie
about it to Michael Isikoff, a reporter at Newsweek magazine.
</P>
<P>
   During an initial interview with Isikoff, Ms. Steele did confirm
hearing about the encounter, but later she recanted, telling the
reporter that Ms. Willey had asked her to lie about it.
</P>
<P>
   Barger said that Ms. Steele changed her story because she was
motivated by money. Ms. Steele sold a photograph of Ms. Willey and
the president to The National Enquirer for $7,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was willing to make money off her friend,'' prosecutor
Stephen Binhak said during his closing argument. ``Selling the
story is what defendant Steele wanted all along.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steele's conviction was clearly a top priority for Starr,
who had six members of his office sitting behind two prosecution
tables in the courtroom all week. By contrast, Ms. Steele had three
defense lawyers seated with her. Starr, who was traveling Friday in
Florida, was informed of the mistrial by deputy independent counsel
Jay Apperson, who declined to say whether a retrial would be
sought. But he added, ``It would be nice to get a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Had she been convicted, Ms. Steele faced a maximum of 35 years
in prison and $1 million in fines. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years, Ms. Steele and Ms. Willey were close friends, but
they have been pitted against each other in an escalating battle
since the summer of 1997. Their deep animosity for each other was
on display this week, as Ms. Willey shot angry glances toward Ms.
Steele, who sat several feet from the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   Although it appeared the case could possibly be a forum for one
final performance from the scandal's major figures, such as Ms.
Lewinsky and Linda Tripp, most of the witnesses were friends and
acquaintances of Ms. Steele and Ms. Willey. The trial was less a
reprisal of last year's voices and instead it became a forum for
the bitter dissolution of their once close friendship.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ms. Steele's lawyers, Eric Dubelier, asked Ms. Willey to
describe a confrontation with Ms. Steele at a Richmond supermarket
over Easter weekend. Ms. Willey acknowledged that she had called
Ms. Steele an obscenity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which of the women to believe became impossible for the jurors
to decide after Ms. Steele's lawyers took the calculated risk of
resting their case without calling her to testify. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the jury seemed to want to hear from Ms. Steele when
they asked the judge during their deliberations for a tape-recorder
to listen to audiotapes of phone messages she had left for a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Luque, the lead attorney for Ms. Steele, said that her
client had been eager to testify but had decided her testimony was
unnecessary because Starr's prosecutors had failed to prove their
case. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Willey acknowledged that she had lied to investigators about
a relationship she had had in 1995 with a younger man. She said she
did so because she was embarrassed about the affair. Dubelier made
the point that prosecutors could have chosen to revoke Ms. Willey's
immunity agreement, but instead they simply forgave her. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the independent counsel, Starr, who betrayed the rule
of law,'' Ms. Luque said in her closing argument. ``This is
America. They can indict anybody, but only you can convict. Only
you can stop this. I think you will.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although she said in her final arguments that Ms. Steele was hit
by Starr's ``runaway train,'' Ms. Luque admonished Ms. Steele
outside the courthouse not to say anything about the prosecutors.
Ms. Steele left the courthouse in a blue van, accompanied by her
two grown children and Richard Gooding, a tabloid reporter whom she
called a friend.

ATTACK MAY WIDEN CHINA OPPOSITION TO NATO  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The bombing of its embassy in Belgrade is certain to
inflame China's already passionate opposition to the NATO air
attacks in Yugoslavia, but it is not clear what direct measures
China can take in response.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has already been under increasing pressure to
take stronger action against the NATO bombing,'' said a military
officer who spoke on the condition of anonymity, and did not know
about the embassy incident until he was told.
</P>
<P>
   The officer said that even before the attack, there was a
consensus among senior military officers that China should more
strongly counter the NATO raids, which China views as an illegal
intervention in a sovereign country.
</P>
<P>
   On hearing of a Yugoslav news agency report that the embassy was
hit by more than one bomb, the officer said this would indicate
that the attack on China's mission may have been deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   The government was weighing how strongly to respond to the
reports that the embassy had been hit by bombs that caused damage
and casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The 8 a.m. television news reported extensive NATO bombing in
Belgrade over the night but did not mention the embassy bombing.
The New China News Agency reported that the embassy had been hit
and that four people were wounded and four others missing, but
their report was available only to news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, the Chinese delegate, Qin Huasun, said,
``NATO's barbarian act is a violation of the U.N. Charter,'' and
called for an immediate end to the NATO air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, China has virulently opposed the American-led
bombing of Yugoslavia. The state-run media attacked the NATO
operations as savagery, part of a plot to extend NATO control over
Eastern Europe. The press here has been consistently one-sided in
its coverage of the conflict, virtually ignoring evidence of
Serbian brutality in Kosovo.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When George W. Bush first ran for governor of
Texas five years ago, he had no record in politics, only a famous
name and a business career that he described as a success ``by any
objective measure.''
</P>
<P>
   In one significant way, that boast may be truer today than it
was in 1994. As Bush seeks to spring from the governorship to the
presidency, he does so with the financial security provided by his
2,359 percent gain from last year's sale of the Texas Rangers,
which transformed his $606,000 investment in the baseball team into
a $14.9 million payday.
</P>
<P>
   But the bottom line is not the only objective measure of a
business career. And closer inspection of Bush's two decades in the
private sector in Texas, which began in the oil patch in Midland
and ended in the owner's box in Arlington, suggests that his record
was mixed. While some ventures made healthy profits, others
struggled for survival. Some of his dealings raised ethical
questions that have provided fodder for political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   With Bush emerging as an early front-runner for the Republican
nomination in 2000, his business dealings also illuminate an
essential question of his biography: whether his success is
primarily inherited or achieved. It is a question that has dogged
Bush, as a son of former President George Bush, throughout his
business career, as throughout his political life.
</P>
<P>
   The most sensible answer, it seems, is that Bush deserves credit
for much of his success, but that he also has benefited at critical
points from his family's prominence and the financial support of
family friends and business and political acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Bush, 52, acknowledged that his name has
generated opportunities not available to everybody, both in
business and in politics. But he asserted that he has never relied
on his name or heritage to ensure his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks to the integrity of my dad and mom, I've inherited a
great name that has sometimes opened doors and sometimes slammed
them shut,'' he said. ``But the business world is a world of
results and performance, and having a famous last name didn't
strike oil or conceive and build the Ballpark at Arlington, or help
the team's win-loss record. And my name hasn't made any decisions
for me as governor.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Bush clearly has received significant help along the
way.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving an MBA from Harvard Business School, for
instance, he started a small oil company in Midland with the
$17,000 remaining in an educational trust fund established by his
parents. Some of the most powerful businessmen in America then took
a chance on the untested oilman by investing hundreds of thousands
of dollars in his first drilling funds. Many were recruited by his
uncle, Jonathan Bush, a New York City stockbroker and the brother
of the former president. When the company stagnated because of
declining market conditions and a serious miscalculation by George
W. Bush, it survived by merging twice with larger firms.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bush's role in the 1989 purchase of the Rangers and the
attention he gained by managing the franchise that launched his
career as governor. His partners praise him for working
aggressively to secure the purchase and for making improvements,
including the construction of a graceful new stadium, that tripled
the value of the team by the time they sold it last June.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the Rangers, Bush's fortunes were aided by his
status as a first son and by the help of others. The late Eddie
Chiles, who sold the team to Bush's group, was a longtime friend
and political supporter of President Bush who picked George W. Bush
from among other suitors at least partly because of his deep
affection for the president, said Richard E. Greene, the former
mayor of Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   And while Bush rounded up half the money used to buy the team,
the deal came together only when Peter Ueberroth, then the baseball
commissioner, personally persuaded Richard E. Rainwater, a
prominent Fort Worth investor, to take a major interest and join
forces with Bush. Bush had previously failed to recruit Rainwater.
One source close to those negotiations said that Ueberroth had
insisted that Rainwater team up with Bush ``out of respect for his
father,'' the president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said there was a time when he was sensitive to his
reputation as a child of privilege. ``When people say silver spoon
and all that business, it may have bothered me when I was a
teen-ager,'' he said. But he said the passage of time and the
compilation of his own record, both in business and in politics,
had thickened his skin. ``Look, I've had some successes and I've
had some failures,'' he said. ``I'm very comfortable now with who I
am.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   THE OILMAN: MORE MERGERS THAN GUSHERS
</P>
<P>
   Bush, eldest son of George and Barbara Bush, graduated from Yale
in 1968. He then enlisted in the Texas Air National Guard at the
height of the Vietnam War, worked in Houston for an agricultural
conglomerate run by a former employee of his father's and helped
manage an unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign in Alabama before
enrolling in business school. Graduating in 1975, he returned to
the West Texas oil town of Midland, where he had spent part of his
youth, and began learning the oil business by running courthouse
title searches on mineral rights.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of his business school classmates, Bush had
developed no real plan for his life. But his father had made his
fortune in the oilfields, and the industry was enjoying one of its
cycles of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my instincts are toward entrepreneurship,'' Bush said,
``and I really wasn't interested in trying out the corporate
culture at that point in my life. I was single, I didn't have many
needs, and I felt that the barriers to entry were pretty darn low
in the oil business.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, oil made Bush a millionaire, and he used his profits
to build an even larger fortune in baseball. But his success in oil
had far more to do with mergers than with gushers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, Bush formed Arbusto Energy Inc., ``ar-BOO-stow'' being
Spanish for ``bush.'' Using the unspent balance in his educational
trust fund _ ``my sole inheritance, except for a great name and a
lot of love'' _ he opened a small office and began to solicit
investors for annual drilling funds that typically bought modest
interests in wells operated by other firms.
</P>
<P>
   In the company's early years, Bush's father was either running
for president, filling Ronald Reagan's ticket or serving as vice
president, and state securities filings show that the original
investors included wealthy and prominent friends of the Bush
family, corporate chieftains, Republican leaders, Bush family
members and clients of Jonathan Bush. The list of investors was
remarkable for a young company owned by a man of 32 with scant
experience and virtually no track record.
</P>
<P>
   It included the likes of Lew Lehrman, the drugstore magnate who
narrowly lost the 1982 governor's race in New York, and George L.
Ball, then president of E.F. Hutton &AMP; Co. Ball said he was
recruited by Scott Pierce, a colleague at Hutton who is the brother
of Barbara Bush. William H. Draper, a venture capitalist from
California who was appointed president of the Export-Import Bank of
the United States by President Reagan, invested in several funds,
as did John D. Macomber, the chief executive officer of Celanese
Corp. who was later named to the same Export-Import post by
President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   One investor recruited by Jonathan Bush, who noted that Bush was
compensated for his work, was Russell S. Reynolds Jr., a leading
corporate headhunter from Greenwich, Conn., who has known the Bush
family for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jonathan called me up one day,'' Reynolds said, ``and said he
had a nephew named George who was an absolute star and had been to
Andover and Yale and Harvard Business School and was getting into
the oil business and would I be interested in being an investor.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds invested $23,250 in 1980, according to the securities
filings. ``The bottom line is it didn't work out very well with
Arbusto,'' he said. ``In fact, George Bush called it `I busted.' I
think we ended up getting 20 cents on the dollar. That's a real
crapshoot, that business. But the guy's absolutely terrific. He's
straight as an arrow. He's a world-class player.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Reynolds, all of the approximately 20 business associates
interviewed for this article described Bush as astute, hardworking,
affable, gritty and honest in their dealings with him.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the first three years, Bush managed to increase the
amount invested in his oil funds, from $565,000 in 1979 to $1.7
million in 1981. But eager to grow faster, he switched strategies
in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   First he shored up his company's cash flow by selling 10 percent
of its stock to a New York investor, Philip A. Uzielli, for the
highly speculative price of $1 million. Uzielli, who declined to be
interviewed, was a Princeton classmate and longtime friend of James
Baker, who was serving at the time as chief of staff in the
Reagan-Bush White House. George W. Bush said he met Uzielli through
another Arbusto investor, George L. Ohrstrom, and only later
learned of Uzielli's relationship with Baker. Baker and Ohrstrom
did not return calls.
</P>
<P>
   Next, with his company regularly mocked as ``Ar-bust-o'' and his
father serving as vice president, Bush changed the firm's name to
Bush Exploration. Then, in the biggest miscalculation of his
business career, he decided to sell public shares in his 1982
oil-drilling fund rather than rely solely on private investments.
The offering failed dismally, with Bush securing only $1.14 million
of the $6 million he had sought to raise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really realized that I had made somewhat of a strategic
error,'' he said. ``The business took a little bit of a downturn,
and the luster was off the drilling funds. I was a small guy trying
to enter the market. And it just didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the company had average luck in its drilling
ventures, but never made a major discovery. ``We went about it the
right way,'' said K. Michael Conaway, the company's treasurer,
``made very cautious decisions. But we just didn't find enough oil
and gas in the ground to be rousingly successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who drove a beat-up Buick and wore sport shirts to work,
recalls his firm as being ``a good, solid little company'' that had
a positive cash flow and provided a steady return for his limited
partners. He said he believes that some at least recouped their
investments, and some, like Ball, verified that they had made
modest profits.
</P>
<P>
   But a company prospectus suggests that many partners, like
Reynolds, must have lost money. It shows that limited partners
contributed $4.67 million to various Bush funds through 1984 but
received distributions of only $1.55 million. Through federal tax
laws aimed at encouraging energy production, they also received
$3.9 million in tax write-offs. Bush, meanwhile, drew a $75,000
salary and owned 80 percent of Arbusto, which contributed $102,000
to the various drilling funds and took distributions of $362,000.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   THE DRY WELL: OIL PRICES FALL; ENTER AN EMIRATE
</P>
<P>
   Burned by his 1982 experience but still anxious to grow, Bush
merged Bush Exploration in 1984 with Spectrum 7 Energy Corp., a
drilling firm based in Cincinnati with an office in Midland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good fit because we were both small and it gave us
bigger size,'' said William O. DeWitt Jr., one of Spectrum's
principals, who also was the son of the former owner of the
Cincinnati Reds. ``We saw it as an opportunity to grow and to get
George, too, who we thought was a dynamic leader and who we thought
would be very good for our business.'' After a stock swap, Bush
became chairman, chief executive officer and a director, with
ownership of about 15 percent of the company, according to a
Spectrum prospectus.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, in 1986, world oil prices collapsed, plummeting
from $26 a barrel in January to below $10 in April. Faced with the
prospect of laying off Spectrum's 15 employees and liquidating its
reserves while waiting for prices to recover, Bush and his partners
decided to merge with Harken Energy Corp., a significantly larger
conglomerate based near Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Spectrum, Harken was not willing to give Bush a daily
management position. But it made him a director, and he received
212,152 shares of Harken stock, worth $530,380, according to
Securities and Exchange Commission filings. By the end of 1989,
Bush had accumulated 345,426 shares, or 1.1 percent of the
company's common stock, often with the help of low-interest loans
and stock options offered to directors.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the merger, Bush moved to Washington to help run
his father's 1988 presidential campaign. But Harken hired him as a
consultant, giving him contracts for between $42,000 and $120,000
in each of the next five years, according to a shareholder's
document.
</P>
<P>
   Several current and former Harken executives declined to comment
on Bush's role at the company. But they have in the past. In 1994,
for instance, E. Stuart Watson, a Harken director, described Bush
as an important asset during dark days for the oil business. ``We
didn't have a fair price for oil, we just had George,'' Watson was
quoted as saying in The Dallas Morning News. ``And George was very
useful to Harken. He could have been more so if he had had funds,
but as far as contacts were concerned, he was terrific. It seemed
like George, he knew everybody in the U.S. who was worth knowing.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is why questions were raised when Harken, which
had little experience with overseas or offshore production,
announced in early 1990 that it had won a potentially lucrative
contract to drill offshore for the island emirate of Bahrain in the
Persian Gulf. Many in the industry assumed that the Bahrainis had
handed the concession to Harken to curry favor with the Bush White
House.
</P>
<P>
   But by all accounts, the younger Bush played no role in pursuing
or negotiating the deal, and he warned board members vigorously
that the company was not ready for a project of that magnitude.
``He was the most skeptical of the bunch,'' said Monte N. Swetnam,
who was then the president of Harken's exploration division.
</P>
<P>
   The man who actually brought Harken and the Bahrainis together
was Michael Ameen, a former Mobil executive in the Middle East with
longstanding relations with the Bahrainis. Ameen said that the
Bahraini minister of development and industry at the time, Yousuf
A. Shirawi, had asked him to find a small American firm to drill in
Bahrain because the Bahrainis did not think a major oil company
would devote adequate time or resources to such a risky project.
Ameen said he then heard about Harken from an investment banker in
Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Shirawi said in an interview that the Bahrainis learned of
Bush's involvement with Harken only after the deal had been
negotiated. ``Maybe he was on the board but I was not aware,''
Shirawi said. Swetnam remembers it differently. ``There was never a
question,'' he said. ``They were clearly aware he was the
president's son.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Harken drilled two very expensive dry holes, with
financing provided by the billionaire Bass family of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   THE QUESTIONS: STOCK IS SOLD, AND PRICE DROPS
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Bush decided to sell stock to pay off a $500,000 bank
loan he had used to buy his share of the Texas Rangers in 1989. On
June 22, he sold his original 212,140 shares of Harken stock for $4
a share, or $848,560.
</P>
<P>
   Eight days later, the company finished the second quarter with a
spectacular loss of $23.2 million, more than eight times the loss
it showed for the second quarter of 1989. In early August, Iraq
invaded Kuwait, and within two weeks Harken's stock fell to $3 a
share on fears that the conflict would threaten the deal with
Bahrain. Then on Aug. 20, when the second-quarter loss was publicly
reported, the price fell to $2.37 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Bush realized quickly that the stock's slide would raise
concerns that he had sold with insider knowledge of the
yet-to-be-reported loss. Although an outside director, he sat on an
audit committee that regularly reviewed the company's financial
practices. The suspicions were compounded when the Securities and
Exchange Commission discovered it did not have a form from Bush
that insiders must file when they sell stock, although Bush
previously filed a different form that had disclosed his intent to
sell.
</P>
<P>
   Bush maintained that he had filed the missing disclosure form.
But the commission investigated the transaction anyway. Bush's
lawyer defended him by arguing that he had not known about the
impending loss when he sold his stock and that he had thought he
was selling into the anticipated good news that the Basses were
underwriting the Bahrain project. His ethical intent, the lawyer,
Robert W. Jordan, said, was demonstrated by his decision to seek
the clearance of a Harken lawyer before making the sale.
Furthermore, Jordan said, Bush did not seek a buyer for his stock
but was solicited by a Los Angeles broker. The broker, Ralph D.
Smith, now retired from Sutro and Co., confirmed that account.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, I was the son of a president,'' Bush said. ``I was
very sensitive to the scrutiny. I felt like liquidating the stock
for personal reasons, but I was also fully aware that any deal I
did was going to be fully scrutinized.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission investigators apparently were convinced by Bush's
explanation, particularly his consultation with counsel, said
officials familiar with the investigation. In 1993, as Bush
prepared to run for governor, the agency sent a letter at the
request of his lawyer advising that ``the investigation has been
terminated as to the conduct of Bush, and that, at this time, no
enforcement action is contemplated.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's opponent in the campaign, the incumbent, Gov. Ann
Richards, suggested that the investigation had been a political
whitewash overseen by commission officials appointed by Bush's
father. But commission officials have denied any political
pressure, and noted that commission leaders with direct ties to the
Bushes had been screened out of the investigation.

<P>
   THE BASEBALL OWNER: A DREAM DEAL NETS THE TEXAS RANGERS
</P>
<P>
   In the years when Bush and DeWitt, his Spectrum 7 business
partner, flew around the country in search of investors, they spent
a lot of time attending baseball games and dreaming about owning a
team. As the Bush presidential campaign wound down in 1988, DeWitt
heard that Eddie Chiles, the crusty and conservative owner of the
Texas Rangers, was looking for a buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the election, Bush returned to Texas to try to put
together a deal with Chiles, who had known the Bush family for
decades. ``I walked into his house,'' Bush recalled, ``and said, `I
would like to buy the team. I'm serious about it. I'll put together
a group of people to buy it. I want you to give me serious
consideration.' And therein began the courtship.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiles was ailing, both physically and financially, and was
anxious to find a buyer. Knowing that Bush had limited resources of
his own, he questioned whether Bush could come up with the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a long line of people at his doorstep wanting to buy
the team, many of whom had the capacity to just write a check,''
said Greene, the former Arlington mayor. ``But his very words to me
were that because of his great admiration for the president and the
initiative shown by the president's son he was going to deal first
with George.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush quickly collected financial commitments from a Yale
classmate, the classmate's business partner, one of his father's
campaign aides and the husband of a Bush cousin. DeWitt, meanwhile,
put together a group of Cincinnati investors.
</P>
<P>
   But Ueberroth, the baseball commissioner, wanted to ensure that
the Rangers remained in the Dallas-Fort Worth market, and he
expressed concern that Bush's small investment would be the only
Texas money in the deal. Ueberroth and Bobby Brown, the American
League president, then visited Rainwater, the Fort Worth investor
who had already rejected Bush's advances, and persuaded him to bid
for the team.
</P>
<P>
   After learning about that meeting, Bush went back to Rainwater,
with encouragement from Ueberroth, and the two men joined forces,
with each agreeing to raise half of the purchase price. The deal
called for Bush and Edward W. Rose III, a Dallas investor who is
close to Rainwater, to share responsibilities as managing general
partners. When Bush asked Rainwater what had changed his mind, Bush
said Rainwater told him, ``The commissioner's a better salesman
than you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Bush described his role in buying the Rangers as
pivotal. ``I wasn't going to let this deal fail,'' he said. ``I
wanted to put together the group. I was tenacious.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of his partners agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``George, I would say, was the catalyst in bringing this thing
together and making it happen,'' said Roland W. Betts, the Yale
classmate who became the team's single largest investor.
</P>
<P>
   Ueberroth is less generous. ``George W. Bush deserves great
credit for the development of the franchise,'' he said in an
interview. ``However, the bringing together of the buying group was
the result of Richard Rainwater, Rusty Rose, Dr. Bobby Brown and
the commissioner.'' Both Rainwater and Rose declined to be
interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   PLAY BALL! WINNING ON FIELD AND OFF, FOR NOW
</P>
<P>
   On April 21, 1989, the Bush-Rose group bought 86 percent of the
Rangers for about $75 million, a price that placed the full value
of the team at $86 million. Bush's initial investment was $500,000,
which he borrowed with his stock holdings as collateral from United
Bank of Midland, where he had served previously as a director. He
later invested more money in the partnership, eventually bringing
his total stake to $606,302, or 1.8 percent of the team.
</P>
<P>
   To reward Bush for his role in structuring the Rangers deal and
managing the franchise, the partners agreed to grant him an
additional 10 percent share of the team once they recouped their
investments along with 2 percent interest. They also voted him a
salary of $200,000 for his full-time work as a managing general
partner.
</P>
<P>
   There is no denying the Rangers' success during Bush's tenure,
both on the field and in the stands. After posting losing records
in six of the seven years before the sale, the Rangers were winners
in seven of the 10 years that they were owned by the Bush group.
They won division titles in 1996 and 1998. Attendance soared from
an average of 18,218 a game in the five years before the sale to an
average of 31,228 in the 10 years after.
</P>
<P>
   Bush played a role in approving the dismissal and subsequent
hiring of one general manager and two field managers, and he
approved major trades, including one lamentable move that sent a
promising minor-league outfielder to the Chicago White Sox. His
name was Sammy Sosa. Bush also became one of the team's most
visible and popular ambassadors, giving speeches, chatting up
reporters, negotiating television contracts, representing the team
at league meetings and signing autographs for hundreds of fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a well-known name and that created interest in the
franchise,'' said Tom Schieffer, the Rangers president. ``It gave
us a little celebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest improvement for the Rangers was the construction of
the Ballpark at Arlington, a 47,000-seat stadium with old-fashioned
elegance and plenty of revenue-producing sky boxes. Bush helped
conceive the design of the stadium, and supported the notion of
financing its construction through a half-cent increase in
Arlington's sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   With other cities in the Dallas-Fort Worth area eager to steal
the team, Arlington officials quickly signed on to the tax increase
and then joined with the Rangers in selling the measure to voters.
Bush helped plot strategy for the referendum campaign but kept a
relatively low profile. With Bush's father in the White House, the
Rangers did not want the politics of the new stadium to become
partisan. Bush critics speculate that the aspiring politician also
did not want to be closely associated with a tax increase. Early in
1991, the tax referendum passed by a margin of nearly 2-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   Under the city's agreement with the Rangers, Arlington would use
its sales tax to generate $135 million while the team would foot
the rest of the bill, ultimately about $60 million. Those proceeds
not only built the stadium, which opened in 1994, but also paid for
an office building, an amphitheater, a museum, a park, a youth
field and substantial acreage surrounding the ballpark that is
slated for commercial development.
</P>
<P>
   The team pays the city's sports authority about $5 million
annually for rent and maintenance. It eventually will have the
option of buying the $195 million complex for less than its
original cost, with the Rangers' annual rent and maintenance
payments acting as credits toward the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the stadium arrangement call it the most egregious
form of corporate welfare and argue that the tax increase stands in
contrast to Bush's anti-tax politics. He responds that Arlington
voters made their own decision. ``I could see the case if this were
cramming down a tax and people had no choice in the matter,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   The new stadium, and the adjacent landholdings, vastly increased
the value of the franchise. Last June, Thomas O. Hicks, a Dallas
entrepreneur, paid $250 million for it, the second largest amount
ever paid for a professional baseball team. Bush's share came to
$14.9 million, and he may receive up to $2 million more after a
final accounting, on his small initial investment.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had withdrawn from the daily management of the Rangers
franchise after being elected governor in 1994. But many of his
business associates have become valuable political friends as well.
Rainwater, for instance, gave $100,000 to Bush's 1994 campaign, and
Hicks and his wife have contributed $70,000 since 1995, according
to campaign finance records.
</P>
<P>
   On April 15, Bush reported that he and his wife, Laura, paid
$3.8 million in federal income taxes for 1998 on estimated taxable
income of $18.4 million. Their annual income had averaged $416,703
in the previous seven years. ``I never dreamed I'd write a check
that big,'' Bush said of his tax bill at the time. ``Of course, I
never dreamed I'd make that much money.''

CLINTON MAY PRESSURE BUSH ON HATE-CRIMES BILL IN TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
and R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) President Clinton all but dared Texas Gov. George W.
Bush Friday to support passage of a new hate-crimes bill, meeting
with relatives of James Byrd Jr. between high-dollar fund-raisers
in Houston and Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work of Lyndon Johnson and Barbara Jordan is being carried
on today here in Austin by the state legislators who are trying to
pass hate crimes legislation in the name of James Byrd,'' Clinton
told a crowd of about 3,000 people at Austin's Bergstrom
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd is the black man from Jasper, Texas, kidnapped and dragged
behind a pickup truck to his death last year by racists.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's daughter, Francis Renee Mullins, 28, and his nephew,
Darrell Verrett, 27, met with Bush on Thursday to urge him to pass
the bill that would strengthen and expand Texas' current
hate-crimes law in Byrd's name and came away disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has promised only to ``seriously'' look at any hate-crimes
legislation that reaches his desk. He has expressed his opposition
to hate-crimes laws in general _ saying it is difficult to punish a
person for his thoughts _ and his opposition to including gays and
lesbians in such laws in particular.
</P>
<P>
   The White House went out of its way to arrange a brief meeting
between Clinton and Byrd's relatives. Clinton met the pair warmly,
on embracing Mullins and keeping his arm around her while they
talked. The two relatives of Byrd wept openly as the president
offered his condolences.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, according to Mullins, said he would call Bush if he
thought it would do any good. She said Clinton told her he might
contact Bush through an unnamed ``mutual friend.``
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the airport crowd that the racist killing of Byrd
was ``anathema'' to most Texans and Americans. But he said
Americans have to take moral stands against such killings to have
the moral authority to halt ethnic genocide in places like Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here in America, if we want to do good abroad, we have to be
good at home,'' Clinton said. ``If we want to be a force against
ethnic cleansing and genocide around the world, we have to be a
force for harmony here at home.``
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, just back from a two-day trip to Europe that focused on
NATO military operations in Yugoslavia, stopped in Texas for two
events that netted the Democratic Party $700,000. He will travel
Saturday to Oklahoma to tour the tornado damage and to offer some
support to the communities ripped apart by the powerful storms.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will be bringing federal commitments worth millions to
help the devastated areas in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   At the fund-raising lunch in Houston and at a dinner at the home
of Austin ad executive Roy Spence, Clinton sought to tie the
storms, Byrd's death and the school violence in Colorado into a
lesson about good triumphing over evil if Americans can resist the
temptation to assign blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to understand there are forces at work in our society
that call on us to make an extra effort to protect our children
from violence,'' Clinton said. ``But instead of saying, `Whose
fault is it?' we should all say, `What can I do to take
responsibility.' ``
</P>
<P>
   The James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Act passed the
Democratic-controlled state House last week but has met strong
opposition in the mostly Republican Senate, where a vote is
expected on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, as a white Southerner, the thought that a man could be
murdered because of his race in 1999 is heartbreaking. I hope that
law will pass,'' Clinton told about 50 people who paid $10,000 a
couple for lunch in Houston on Friday. ``I hope that Texas will
say, `We don't want people to be hurt because of their race,
because they're gay or because whatever.' ``
</P>
<P>
   The state passed a hate crime bill in 1993 under Democratic Gov.
Ann Richards. Bush signed an amended version of the law in 1997.
But proponents of the new bill say the current law is vague and
virtually unenforceable.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said Bush would talk to the
president if he calls. But McClellan said Clinton does not
understand the full situation in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps the president does not realize Texas already has a
hate crimes law that was strengthened by the legislation signed by
Governor Bush in 1997,'' McClellan said.

EMBASSY BOMBING MAY COMPLICATE U.N. SUPPORT FOR PEACEKEEPERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With KOSOVO-MILITARY) 
(mk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The apparent bombing of the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade, Yugoslavia, is expected to complicate, and could even
undermine, efforts by the United States and other NATO members to
win U.N. endorsement of an international peacekeeping force for
Kosovo, administration officials acknowledged Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   China, which has a veto in the U.N. Security Council, has
steadfastly opposed the NATO bombing campaign in Yugoslavia and has
made clear its suspicion about the motives of the Western alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Still, administration officials said they believe that if NATO
is able to come up with a Russian-endorsed peace plan that ends the
bombing, it is difficult to imagine that China would veto a
Security Council resolution sanctioning a peacekeeping force,
despite the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Operating on little beyond television news accounts of the
bombing, White House and State Department officials said they
immediately telephoned senior diplomats at the Chinese Embassy in
Washington Friday evening to express their concern.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, the American ambassador, James Sasser, was alerted
by the White House by phone to the developments in Belgrade and
asked to meet with senior Chinese officials to offer condolences.
</P>
<P>
   News of the bombing was immediately relayed to President Clinton
and to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright shortly after she met
with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said in a statement issued after the meeting that he was
``shocked and distressed to learn that NATO airstrikes'' apparently
hit the embassy and a civilian hospital in the city of Nis. ``He
reiterates his conviction that an urgent political solution must be
found to the present crisis in the region,'' said a spokesman, Fred
Eckhard.
</P>
<P>
   While consultations with the Chinese have seemed almost a second
thought to the Clinton administration during the air war, China has
the power through its Security Council veto to defeat any U.N.
resolution endorsing an international peacekeeping force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Under a peace plan approved this week by the Group of Seven most
industrialized nations and Russia, any peacekeeping force in Kosovo
must be ``endorsed and adopted by the United Nations,'' wording
apparently intended to satisfy Russia and to make it possible for
Moscow to take part in a peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, American and European leaders had begun to court
China more aggressively for its support for _ or, more likely, its
lack of opposition to _ a Security Council resolution. Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder of Germany had been expected to travel to Beijing
next month for talks with the Chinese leaders and to press them to
reconsider any possible plans to exercise their U.N. veto on
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   China has opposed the air campaign against Yugoslavia from the
start, consistent with its fiercely held position that a group of
countries cannot interfere in the internal affairs of others. The
Chinese may well see a parallel between Kosovo and Tibet or Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the Chinese vetoed a separate Security Council
resolution to extend the mandate for a U.N. peacekeeping operation
in Macedonia, across the border from Yugoslavia, apparently a
demonstration of China's fury over Macedonia's diplomatic
recognition of Taiwan earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials insisted Friday night that they had no
confirmation that NATO was responsible for the bombing at the
Chinese Embassy. ``One of the things we've learned during the last
45 days is to be careful of what what we say before we know
anything,'' said a senior official.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another senior official said he believed that whether or not
NATO proves to be responsible for the attack, the Chinese are not
likely to veto an international peacekeeping force in Kosovo that
would end the bombing campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we did indeed hit the Chinese Embassy by accident, we would
express our regret to them,'' the official said. ``There would be
discussions and regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``But China has made very clear that it is opposed to the use of
force. And if every other member of the Security Council believed
that a peaceful solution was possible, China does not have a
history of standing in the way. It would be hard to envision them
justifying that.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, China had close relations with Yugoslavia,
largely because the government in Belgrade, while Communist, held
to a policy of fierce nonalignment, and was seen as a foil in
Europe to the power of the Soviet Union. The relationship has
remained friendly.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, visited China after
the 1995 peace agreement in Bosnia and received all the trappings
of a formal state visit. His wife, Mira Markovic, has been to China
on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Ms. Markovic unveiled plans to build a Chinatown
in Belgrade, but a shortage of funds apparently killed the project.
Her only complaint about the Beijing government is that it has
adopted an economy that is too capitalistic. China was delivering
oil to Yugoslavia until several days ago, but stopped deliveries
for reasons that appeared to be entirely capitalistic: Beijing was
not being paid for the fuel.

STATEMENT BY SUSPECT'S LAWYER: HE ASSISTED FBI  
 (WITH CHINA-NUKE)
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from a statement by Mark Holscher, a
lawyer for Wen Ho Lee, who was dismissed from the Los Alamos
National Laboratory over reported security violations:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wen Ho Lee has dedicated himself to the defense of this
country for the last 20 years. His work, much of which is
classified, has led directly to the increased safety and national
security of all Americans, and he is responsible for helping this
country safely simulate nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 and 1988, Dr. Lee went to mainland China to present
papers at two technical conferences. Dr. Lee's participation in
these conferences was preapproved and encouraged by the Los Alamos
Laboratory and the Department of Energy. These same entities also
cleared the texts of the papers given at these conferences, which
covered mathematics and physics topics.
</P>
<P>
   The press has incorrectly reported that Dr. Lee made ``several''
trips to mainland China and also has failed to report that his two
trips were approved in advance by the Los Alamos Laboratory and the
Department of Energy. These two approved trips were the only times
Dr. Lee has ever traveled to mainland China. These false press
reports do a disservice both to Dr. Lee and the Los Alamos
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The press reports also fail to include the fact that Dr. Lee
presented similar papers at conferences in several countries
throughout Western Europe and other parts of the world. The false
insinuations that Dr. Lee went to mainland China in the late 1980s
with an improper purpose are unfair. Not only did Dr. Lee go to
mainland China to present a technical paper, his and his wife's
attendance were with the full knowledge and approval of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There have been inaccurate press reports regarding the
circumstances surrounding Dr. and Mrs. Lee's cooperation with the
government. Mrs. Lee agreed to the FBI's request that she assist it
as a volunteer without pay in the FBI's efforts to monitor Chinese
scientists. She agreed to help the FBI with the full knowledge and
approval of Dr. Lee and continued to do so for a number of years.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of the FBI, Dr. Lee's wife attended the 1986
conference with him, where she voluntarily provided background
information on Chinese scientists. Dr. and Mrs. Lee supported and
agreed with the FBI's request that Mrs. Lee assist it in obtaining
background information on Chinese scientists. It simply defies
logic for critics to now allege that Dr. Lee was engaged in
improper activities in mainland China while he and his wife were
there.
</P>
<P>
   At no time during or after the preapproved 1986 or 1988 trips
did Dr. Lee ever provide any classified information whatsoever to
any representative of mainland China, nor has he ever given any
classified information to any unauthorized persons. As was
anticipated and approved by the U.S. government, Dr. Lee and his
wife socialized with Chinese scientists. It was fully understood by
the Department of Energy and the Los Alamos laboratory that the
conferences included social events with the participants.
</P>
<P>
   For over three years, government agencies have investigated Dr.
and Mrs. Lee's 1986 and 1988 trips to mainland China. To date,
these investigatory agencies have not found any evidence that Dr.
Lee ever disclosed any classified information to anyone in mainland
China. ...
</P>
<P>
   Both Dr. and Mrs. Lee were briefed by the FBI before their 1986
trip, to gather background information regarding Chinese
scientists. While there, they followed the FBI's instructions, and
after this trip, Mrs. Lee briefed the FBI. Upon returning from
their 1988 trip, Mrs. Lee provided a written report to the FBI. In
addition, Mrs. Lee agreed to the FBI's request that she permit an
FBI agent to monitor her communications with Chinese scientists in
her role as Los Alamos laboratory's liaison. For several years,
Mrs. Lee forwarded translated copies of all correspondence with
Chinese scientists to FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lee assisted the FBI in its investigation of suspected
espionage activity at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
In l982, Dr. Lee spoke briefly with a Livermore scientist who was
rumored to be facing disciplinary action for delivering a
scientific paper in Taiwan. Dr. Lee, who was considering delivering
a scientific paper in Taiwan, called the scientist. Due to its
interception of the call, the FBI questioned Dr. Lee and gave him a
polygraph test to ensure that his contact with the Livermore
scientist was for an innocent purpose. Dr. Lee was told he passed
the polygraph test.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI then asked Dr. Lee to help them by flying to Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory to meet with the Livermore scientist
about that scientist's involvement with China. Dr. Lee readily
agreed to help. The FBI paid for Dr. Lee's travel expenses to
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Dr. Lee received
instructions from the FBI before the meeting, met with the
scientist and then briefed the FBI after this meeting. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Press reports incorrectly state that Dr. Lee mishandled his Los
Alamos laboratory computer files. Dr. Lee has never given
classified computer files to any unauthorized person. In fact, Dr.
Lee took substantial steps to protect his computer files, and we
are confident that federal investigators will also conclude that no
third party could have or did access his protected computer files.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Los Alamos scientists, Dr. Lee was expressly
permitted to spend 20 percent of his time on projects unrelated to
his classified activities. Contrary to recent press reports, Dr.
Lee's computer files contained dozens of nonclassified codes, which
include several hundred thousand lines of code. Dr. Lee's changing
of file names on nonclassified computer codes to reflect
improvements he made an nonclassified codes is not only proper, it
is accepted and recognized as standard procedure when revising
computer codes. It is irresponsible for the press to falsely
portray any unclassified codes as containing classified
information, and it is equally irresponsible for the press to fail
to disclose that it is accepted procedure to change file names to
reflect improvements or additions to codes, whether classified or
nonclassified. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both Dr. Lee and his wife have lived and will continue to live
the modest life they have led in New Mexico. Dr. Lee will not be a
scapegoat for alleged security problems at our country's nuclear
laboratories. Nor should he be used to further the political
agendas of those who are illegally leaking confidential information
concerning the details of the government's investigation.

STARS DOWNPLAYING GAME 1'S SLASHFEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe this transition to toughness has gone too far for the
Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bad Boys of Hockey'' made another trip to the principal's
office yesterday and lost another player. Pat Verbeek will leave
for a one-game suspension the same day Derian Hatcher is scheduled
to return from his seven-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   So much for anyone calling the Stars soft.
</P>
<P>
   Verbeek and St. Louis forward Jamal Mayers were suspended
yesterday for today's Game 2 of the best-of-seven Western
Conference semifinals series. Each player was disciplined by NHL
director of operations Colin Campbell for related slashing
incidents in Game 1, won by the Stars, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents put a new twist on the Stars-Blues series as both
sides declared beforehand ``ultimate respect'' for the other. Now,
there seems to be a little debris, as Stars coach Ken Hitchcock
likes to call it. The Blues called for a longer suspension for
Verbeek, who slashed center Pierre Turgeon on the back of the knee,
causing nerve damage that might force Turgeon to miss tonight's
game.
</P>
<P>
   Verbeek said he willingly accepts the one-game suspension, but
he disagrees vehemently with those who say he was trying to injure
Turgeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were trying to make it out like it was a malicious,
intentional attempt to injure, and it wasn't at all,'' Verbeek
said. ``I saw him trying to take liberties with \Rgoalie\S Eddie
\RBelfour\S after the whistle had blown, and I wanted to send a
message. The play happened in a split second. I wasn't aiming for
any area; I just wanted him to know to stay away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars tried to downplay the incident, but the Blues said the
issue has not been settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that got us excited, knowing that the bad blood is
exposed,'' Blues coach Joel Quenneville said. ``That could carry
and energize our team and may be bring out the passion that was
needed \RThursday\S and for the rest of the series.''
</P>
<P>
   The two teams will try to ferret through the emotional litter, a
couple of potential lineup changes and some key conditioning issues
to play a game that likely will be critical to the series outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Game 2 is the most important game for the home team,''
Hitchcock said. ``It sets up the race or the gap, one way or the
other. You either go into the other team's rink with them knowing
they can have home-ice advantage or you set up the gap. It always
has more emphasis for the home team, just like Game 3 does for the
team going back to their home.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Hitchcock was trying to take the emotion out
of Game 2. After a physically and emotionally draining series with
Edmonton in the opening round, Hitchcock was an advocate for a
calculated approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just part and parcel of the game,'' he said. ``It's so
tame compared to the Edmonton series that I don't even worry about
it. I don't think there will be focus in \Rrevenge\S once the puck
drops. We both might use it as motivation, but that stuff leaves
after the first couple of shifts.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Hitchcock said he'll have enough trouble trying to rein
in Hatcher, the team captain who was suspended seven games for
breaking Phoenix center Jeremy Roenick's jaw. The Stars have gone
5-0 in the playoffs without Hatcher. What's more, they've posted a
league-best 1.17 goals-against average while missing their top
defender.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to put a leash on him,'' Hitchcock said. ``He'll be
pretty revved up to play. and we'll have to have it somewhat under
control... somewhat.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the control was hopefully provided by Campbell, who
moved quickly to announce equal suspensions. Verbeek started the
incident by making what Blues coach Joel Quenneville called a
``vicious'' slash on Turgeon with about two minutes remaining in
Game 1. Then Mayers tried to send a retaliatory message in the
final 28 seconds by rushing in to slash Stars defenseman Darryl
Sydor. Sydor is listed as ready to play after getting a bruise on
his upper left arm. Turgeon is listed as questionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think \RCampbell\S decided that he wanted to avoid the
situation turning into a matter of retribution,'' Stars general
manager Bob Gainey said. ``From his point of view, using whatever
criteria he wants to use, I think he was saying he doesn't want to
see any more of this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, bad boys that they are, have learned that detention
could await.

SLASHES SIGNAL BAD BLOOD BETWEEN STARS, BLUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Forget needing Phoenix and broken-jawed Jeremy Roenick
to provide second-round drama.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Stars players find themselves contending with an
injured Pierre Turgeon and an agitated bunch of St. Louis Blues in
Game 2 of the Western Conference semifinals at 6:30 tonight at
Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that got us excited, knowing that the bad blood is
exposed,'' Blues coach Joel Quenneville said. ``That could carry
and energize our team and maybe bring out the passion that was
needed \RThursday\S and for the rest of the series.''
</P>
<P>
   A day after Turgeon was injured by a two-handed slash by Stars
winger Pat Verbeek with 2:18 remaining in Game 1, Blues officials,
coaches and players were lobbying for a lengthy suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Turgeon, after all, is questionable for Game 2 because of
soreness in his left knee resulting from Verbeek's slash.
</P>
<P>
   Justice proved to be a bit lighter, though. Verbeek was
suspended for one game _ identical to a suspension given to Blues
forward Jamal Mayers for a retaliatory slash on Stars defenseman
Darryl Sydor with 28 seconds remaining in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in these types of situations you always feel the same
way,'' Blues GM Larry Pleau said. ``I think you're always saying to
yourself: `It should be more.' But all we can do is present our
case and let the NHL make its decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Pleau pleaded St. Louis' case to NHL director of operations
Colin Campbell after Game 1 as follows:
</P>
<P>
   Verbeek's slash of Turgeon was intentional, a callous attempt to
injure St. Louis' best forward after play had been whistled dead.
</P>
<P>
   Turgeon missed practice and may miss Game 2. Quenneville said he
has nerve damage in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Verbeek has a history of cheap shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it certainly was intentional because you don't hit a guy
behind the leg, right where you don't have any padding, right in
the knee where he is defenseless,'' Quenneville said. ``\RTurgeon\S
had his back turned, too, so \RVerbeek\S knew what he was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Pleau and Quenneville said that equating Mayers' slash of Sydor
to Verbeek's slash of Turgeon isn't fair. Both said Mayers' slash
lacked an intent to injure.
</P>
<P>
   Mayers said he had simply been trying to disrupt Sydor's shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do it a lot of times,'' Mayers said. ``The guy is following
through with his shot, and if you stop his follow-through, the puck
won't go as far. I just happened to catch him in an awkward spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Quenneville: ``I think he was respecting his teammate.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said Sydor's fine and will play in
Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   Sydor may be back to normal, but this series doesn't seem likely
to return to its placid beginnings, with the juiciest plot being
Stars winger Brett Hull returning to play his former teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the star player (Turgeon) already has been slashed. The
villain (Verbeek, a k a Little Ball of Hate to his teammates)
already has been suspended. The suspension (one game) already has
been questioned.
</P>
<P>
   The fun begins here.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hope the league deals with it, but if they don't, we have
25 guys who saw it,'' Blues goalie Grant Fuhr said. ``What goes
around, comes around. If that's the way it's going to be, you get
an eye-for-an-eye deal.''

ATTACK MAY WIDEN CHINA OPPOSITION TO NATO  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS first 5 grafs to writethru with updates on reaction to
bombing; to move up comment from U.N. delegate and to update New
China News Agency info with 1 DEAD, 3 MISSING, and 4 wounded; subs

<P>
   BEIJING _ As China weighed its formal response to the NATO
bombing of its embassy in Belgrade, foreign policy experts and
officials here said the attack would create intense pressures on
the government to oppose forcefully the U.S.-led air attacks in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday morning, news of the embassy bombing had not yet
been reported on television, the public remained unaware of the
attack, and government offices in Beijing had not made any formal
comment. At the United Nations in New York, the Chinese delegate,
Qin Huasun, said, ``NATO's barbarian act is a violation of the U.N.
charter,'' and he repeated Chinese calls for an immediate end to
the air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As news of the bombing and casualties becomes known here, it is
certain to inflame the already passionate sense that NATO's bombing
raids in Yugoslavia constitute illegal aggression _ a view deeply
held by much of the public as well as by officials.
</P>
<P>
   The New China News Agency said Saturday morning, in a report
seen only by news organizations, that one embassy staff member was
killed, four others were wounded and three were still missing after
three missiles hit the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   But if current diplomatic initiatives fail to stop the campaign,
it is not clear what direct measures China could take to counter
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has already been under increasing pressure to
take stronger action against the NATO bombing,'' said a military
officer who spoke on the condition of anonymity, and did not know
about the embassy incident until he was told.
</P>
<P>
   The officer said that even before the attack, there was a
consensus among senior military officers that China should more
strongly counter the NATO raids, which China views as an illegal
intervention in a sovereign country.
</P>
<P>
   Jia Qingguo, a professor of international studies at Beijing
University, said, ``This strengthens the hand of those who have
argued for closer Chinese-Russian cooperation in aiding Serbia
against NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, China opposed the bombing but Yugoslavia was far
away,'' Jia said. ``Now the war is brought closer to home.''

KNOBLAUCH HURT BUT RELIEVED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chuck Knoblauch was stretched out on the trainer's
table with his left leg elevated for more than two hours Friday. He
rubbed his eyes, scratched his head and spoke to several Yankees as
they trickled by him. Knoblauch did not start against the Seattle
Mariners Friday night and will probably miss at least a few games,
but the Yankees are still very relieved.
</P>
<P>
   After Knoblauch was body rolled by Minnesota's Corey Koskie at
second base on Thursday, his leg buckled and he crumbled to the
artificial turf. The Yankees had initially feared that Knoblauch
would miss an extensive amount of time, but medical tests revealed
no broken bones or ligament damage. Knoblauch has a severely
bruised lower left leg and the Yankees still have a mostly healthy
second baseman who will probably not have to be put on the disabled
list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very fortunate,'' Knoblauch said. ``It's amazing. It
definitely could be a lot worse. I could be lying somewhere else
right now if I was hit one fraction of an inch one way or the
other. To be unscathed after that, I'm lucky to be standing here.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch looked weary as he stood near his locker. He barely
slept on Thursday night because of the throbbing pain in his leg,
yet he claimed that he would like to try to play Saturday. But Don
Zimmer, the interim manager, said the Yankees would probably rest
Knoblauch for the weekend and see if he is ready to start on
Tuesday against the Angels. Like Knoblauch, Zimmer is relieved that
Knoblauch's injury seems minor and that he did not even need to
have additional tests Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say he could have been hurt very, very bad,'' Zimmer
said. ``When he said he was lucky, I know what he meant. He's lucky
he didn't tear up a knee or break a leg.''
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied, 3-3, in the bottom of the eighth inning
Thursday, the Twins had the bases loaded with one out when Ron
Coomer hit a chopper to Derek Jeter. It would have been difficult
to turn a double play, but Knoblauch hung in at second to try for
it and Koskie barreled into his leg with a half-slide,
half-takedown.
</P>
<P>
   With Knoblauch on the ground writhing in pain, the Yankees were
concerned that their second baseman might be out for a while.
Umpire Jim Joyce ruled that Koskie, who is 6 feet 3 inches and
weighs 217 pounds, had interfered with Knoblauch's attempt to turn
two and called him out, squelching the rally. But general manager
Brian Cashman was so worried about Knoblauch's status that he
immediately called Mark Newman, the vice president for player
development and scouting, and told him to alert the minor leagues
that the Yankees might be recalling an infielder.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that Knoblauch was seriously hurt, Cashman did not
even wait until Knoblauch returned from getting X-rays at the
hospital before contacting Newman. ``You go into worry mode and you
think the worst,'' Cashman said. ``It's easy to think about Joe
Theismann. That's the first thing I thought about.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashman called the collision a ``career-threatening situation''
and reiterated that the Yankees did not think Knoblauch would be
disabled. Even though Knoblauch stressed that he would like to play
Saturday or Sunday, the Yankees have Luis Sojo to take his place
and they will surely be conservative in allowing Knoblauch to come
back. Knoblauch, who must wait until the swelling dissipates and he
gains more flexibility in the leg, conceded that he felt like a
tackling dummy.
</P>
<P>
   ``To actually get blindsided like that,'' he said, ``I've never
been hit like that.''
</P>
<P>
   But, even after cringing as he watched replays of the collision,
Knoblauch did not feel that Koskie was guilty of a dirty slide and
merely called the slide reckless. What looked horrible on Thursday
looked much better Friday. Knoblauch's leg was heavily taped and he
was limping, but he still felt lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The replay looked bad,'' Knoblauch said. ``I feel fortunate
that nothing happened. To see it on the replay, I really appreciate
it more.''

SPORTS COLUMN: BREATHLESS IN MIAMI ONCE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: REMOVES reference to pink panties in third graf; ADDS detail

 By HARVEY ARATON

<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ The average plant manager or chief operating
officer sticks his or her head into a bucket of ice water and is
immediately suspected of having spent too much time in the sun. Pat
Riley dunks himself and _ glug, glug _ he is lauded once again for
masterfully motivating his Miami Heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can envision that happening,'' Jeff Van Gundy said Friday,
before leaving for Miami, where his Knicks begin another tractor
pull of a playoff series Saturday against the top-seeded Macho Men
of Riley. ``I've been inside that locker room.''
</P>
<P>
   He meant inside Riley's notorious chamber of pre-game challenges
to his players' manhood, where this season Riley reportedly went
face down into the bucket, emerging to declare: ``You've got to
want to win as much as you want to breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   We may shake our heads at the preposterousness of this, but, as
we live and breathe, Riley's next collection of inspirational
urgings, just like the last one, will probably wind up on the
best-seller list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaches do what works for them, what their personality is,''
Van Gundy said. ``That's not in mine, but when Pat was coaching
here, I saw him walk into the locker room in a pair of cleats, as
if to say, `We're coming in with our spikes up.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Van Gundy's favorite you-had-to-be-there
reminiscence of Riley's New York years, a pre-game locker room in a
playoff series against Chicago. Riley told the story of the frog
that agreed to carry the scorpion across the water as long as the
scorpion promised not to sting. After the inevitable, as they were
both sinking, the frog wanted to know what the point of the sting
had been.
</P>
<P>
   `` `I'm a scorpion, and that's what scorpions do,''' Riley said.
And to his team: ``We are Knicks, and what Knicks do is sting
Bulls.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley then turned to Dick Harter, another assistant, and asked
if he had something to add. Harter suggested that the first time
B.J. Armstrong pushed his mouth guard out of his mouth with his
tongue, as he often did during stoppages of play, someone seize the
opportunity to shove it down his throat.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Oakley stood up to volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'm talking about!'' Oakley yelled as he led the
frothing Knicks out the door.
</P>
<P>
   While Van Gundy and the Knicks were massing at the Miami border
Friday, the predictably stupid war metaphors were being applied to
the third installment of the Knicks-Heat playoff trilogy. Both
coaches, conversely, expressed confidence that the principal
players finally understood the dire consequences of crossing what
we may call the Thorn Line, named for the man who dispenses fines
and suspensions for the National Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   One would think so, at least hope so. No one should hold his
breath, though, unless he plans to watch these games with his face
submerged in a glass water bucket. Riley and Van Gundy can talk all
they want about self-control, but their players have also been
getting an earful this week about fighting to the last gasp, spikes
up. That's what the Heat and Knicks do, even if it means they both
drown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to go down there with force,'' Van Gundy said,
borrowing again from his mentor's short list glossary of playoff
hardball.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to dispute Riley's 1990s regular-season success in
New York and Miami, beginning with a Knicks team Van Gundy fondly
remembered as nasty. Riley didn't invent physical playoff
basketball, but he surely heightened its bad intentions, and so it
is not unfair to point out that he is 0-for-the-decade in terms of
achieving his ultimate goal.
</P>
<P>
   Most people believe he won't win his first title sans Magic
Johnson this year either, despite bleeding every last victory out
of a team handicapped by injury and offensive inefficiency. With
Michael Jordan gone, the smart money is on the slick-passing and
skills-endowed teams from Indiana, San Antonio, Portland and Utah.
Riley won four titles in Los Angeles with Showtime, but when he
came east, the man behind the makeup turned out to be the street
tough from Schenectady, with his pack of cigarettes tucked under
his T-shirt sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   No team wins the championship holding its breath. This is, above
all, a game of movement, of accuracy, of flow. If the Knicks can
muster enough offense out of Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell, if
Patrick Ewing can let the game come to him, then they have a chance
to again knock Riley out of the first round. They can dunk and
debunk his motivational mystique for good. &QL;

U.S. TRIAL TO GO ON FOR AIDE TO SHEIK 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge in Brooklyn refused Friday to drop an
indictment against an Egyptian man whose lawyer claimed he was
being unfairly targeted for prosecution because of his political
and religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, by U.S. District Court Judge Carol Bagley Amon,
clears the way for a trial of the man, Nasser Ahmed, a follower of
Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, the cleric convicted in 1995 in the
conspiracy to blow up landmarks in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed, who worked as a paralegal for Rahman during his trial,
has been involved in a bitter, three-year battle with the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service over its attempts to deport
him based on classified information that the agency refuses to make
public. In that case, which is still pending, Ahmed has been
detained without bond for more than three years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the government indicted Ahmed in December on
charges of making false statements in a decade-old immigration
matter; because of Friday's ruling, he will now be tried in June on
those charges. The case involved an application from Ahmed for
residency status under a special program for farm workers.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed's lawyer in the false statements case, Roger Stavis, said
his client had been the victim of selective prosecution because of
his links to Rahman.
</P>
<P>
   Stavis said the government had acknowledged in the past that the
farm worker program had been so rife with fraud that the government
had essentially decided against prosecuting any of the hundreds of
thousands of individuals suspected of submitting false applications
_ until the authorities decided to indict Ahmed last year.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors disagreed, telling Judge Amon that several
other such cases had been brought in Manhattan, and that there was
a basis for prosecuting Ahmed, although the reasons had to remain
secret. In much the same way that the authorities have moved
against Ahmed with secret evidence in the immigration matter, the
government filed a secret document with Judge Amon laying out the
evidence in the criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   The information was ``highly confidential,'' the government told
the judge in a public document, and its disclosure ``could create
significant safety risks.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have said in the deportation case that Ahmed is
a member of the Islamic Group, an extremist organization, based in
Egypt, that has claimed responsibility for several acts of
terrorism. Ahmed, who has not been charged with terrorism, has
denied being a member of the group or having any role in terrorist
acts.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors told Judge Amon that another reason they indicted
Ahmed was that he had lied in the deportation proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   A former federal prosecutor, Gerard Lynch, who is now a
professor of law at Columbia University School of Law, said that
motions to dismiss cases on grounds of selective prosecution are
rarely won, and that prosecutors have broad discretion in their
charging decisions as long as they do not discriminate on racial or
other grounds.
</P>
<P>
   In court Friday, Ahmed stood quietly by his lawyer, rocking
occasionally on his feet. Afterward, his lawyer, Stavis, expressed
disappointment in the ruling, and said that his client would
contest the charge at trial in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that he's being prosecuted not because of what he
did,'' Stavis said, ``but because of who he was associated with.''

AS 2 STATES FEUD, 2 MAJOR SHIPPING LINES AGREE TO STAY IN N.Y.

   NEW YORK _ Two of the largest shipping lines in the world
announced Friday that they had accepted a lease proposal from New
Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman and the Port Authority of New York and
New Jersey that would allow them to remain in the New York harbor
and expand their operations instead of moving to Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The shipping lines, Sea-Land Services and Maersk Inc., said they
had decided to develop a deep-water port here even though New York
Gov. George Pataki, who controls the Port Authority with Whitman,
has not approved a new lease for the two shippers at the Elizabeth
Marine Terminal in New Jersey. The two moderate Republican
governors have engaged in a bitter public feud in recent months
that has paralyzed billions of dollars in projects and threatened
to tear the Port Authority apart.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki could still scuttle the agreement as the Port Authority
works out the details of the 29-year lease over the next couple of
months. But with Friday's announcement, the shippers signaled their
intention to stay anyway, lured by New Jersey's proposal of an
additional $120 million in state funds, much of which will go
toward paying for dredging the shipping channels in the harbor. The
states had originally sought to pass the cost of this work on to
the shippers.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the two shippers have dropped their threat to move
1,000 jobs and a $100 million payroll to Baltimore, shipping
executives and politicians on both sides of the Hudson River are
hoping that the tension between the two governors will subside and
that they will be able to resolve their dispute. Sea-Land and
Maersk together handle about a quarter of the 1.5 million cargo
containers moving through the port.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turns down the heat under the pot,'' said Joan Verplanck,
president of the New Jersey State Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Several important Port Authority projects that had been stalled
by the dispute are now expected to move forward, including a new $1
billion terminal for American Airlines at Kennedy International
Airport and a $700 million renovation of the Continental terminals
at Newark Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will allow us to continue to be the No. 1 port on the
East Coast, bringing new jobs and commerce to the region,'' said
Port Authority Chairman Lewis Eisenberg, who was appointed by
Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the simmering rancor between the two states was evident
in their responses to the announcement by the two shippers.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Torpey, Whitman's chief of staff, said he was pleased
with the shippers' decision. New Jersey had feared that the loss of
Sea-Land and Maersk could cause defections by other shippers and a
decline in a $20 billion industry that accounts for 166,500 jobs,
evenly split between New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident that whatever issues that need to be resolved
will be resolved,'' Torpey said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Gargano, vice chairman of the Port Authority and
Pataki's chief negotiator, was less enthusiastic. He said he was
confident that Maersk and Sea-Land were merely seeking concessions
on their lease, and would not have moved to Baltimore. After New
York refused to budge on the lease negotiations in April, New
Jersey sweetened an old Port Authority lease offer that had been
rejected by the shippers by adding $120 million in state funds.
Sea-Land and Maersk have now embraced that proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Gargano said that New York and New Jersey still have to resolve
larger issues over the division of Port Authority revenue between
the two states. In recent weeks, Pataki has demanded a radical
restructuring of the Port Authority that would give New York 75
percent of the revenue because, he said, New York projects generate
most of the agency's profits. Whitman has agreed to restructure the
Port Authority, but has refused to agree to Pataki's revenue
demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still a number of significant issues that remain to
be resolved with New Jersey, particularly as they relate to
insuring that New York is treated fairly by the Port Authority,''
Gargano said.
</P>
<P>
   The lease negotiations with Sea-Land and Maersk have been marked
by intense bargaining by the shippers, as well as the two states.
After rejecting an initial lease offer from the Port Authority last
year, Sea-Land and Maersk publicly invited other ports on the East
Coast to bid for the their business.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore saw an opportunity to double or even triple its
shipping volume and offered to build the two companies a 330-acre
complex. The longshoremen's union and New Jersey accused New York
of failing to grasp the importance of the shipping industry.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, New York saw the lease negotiations as an
opportunity to wrest financial control of the Port Authority from
New Jersey. Even after Sea-Land's lease expired Feb. 28, New York
refused to change its position, forcing Whitman to provide $120
million in state funds or risk losing the shippers.
</P>
<P>
   Sea-Land and Maersk, in turn, could no longer postpone their
final decision on where to build a hub port. Maersk president Tommy
Thomsen said Friday that New York's proposal proved superior.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at New York
University, said Pataki had called the shippers' bluff and forced
New Jersey to pay a greater share of the cost of retaining the two
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Pataki turned out to be a far better poker player than
Christine Whitman or the shippers,'' Moss said.
