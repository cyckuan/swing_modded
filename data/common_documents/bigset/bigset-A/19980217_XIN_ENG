<HEADLINE> Indonesia Supports Diplomatic Solution to Iraq Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign minister
Ali Alatas said Monday that Indonesia supports the United Nations'
efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis over U.N.
weapons inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the U.N. Meeting on Regional
Disarmament here, Alatas said Indonesia would support a diplomatic
solution which could be accepted by both the United States and
Iraq, and meet the goals of U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"They should not use weapons, but it should be solved through
diplomatic channels," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The United States has recently threatened to begin an offensive
against Iraq if that country refused to open all sites to U.N.
weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said the Indonesian government has a contingency plan
for Indonesians living in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The regional U.N. meeting, which ends on February 18, is being
attended by 52 participants from 25 countries and non-governmental
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was opened by U.N. Under Secretary General for

<P>
BAGHDAD, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Iraqi National
Assembly (Parliament) held a march in Baghdad Monday to protest
against the threats of the United States to attack Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A group of the Iraqi Parliament members led by Speaker Saadoun
Hammadi marched to the headquarters of United Nations
organizations in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
They called on the international community and Arab
parliamentarians to stand up to U.S. threats to hit Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A visiting delegation of the Arab Parliamentary Union joined
the Iraqi MPs in the protest.
</P>
<P>
Hammadi handed a note to the Representative of the U.N.
Development Program.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the Iraqi Parliament said the note calls on United
Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan to make efforts to avert the
possible U.S. military strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has said to attack Iraq if it does not give free
access to the U.N. arms inspectors in charge of eliminating Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction to all suspect sites.
</P>
<P>
The note also asked Annan to help reach a formula acceptable to
the concerned parties to accelerate the lifting of the sanctions
imposed on Iraq by the U.N. in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait,
the sources said.

<HEADLINE> UK Moves to Expel Sinn Fein from Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The British government on Monday
formally called for the expulsion of Sinn Fein from Northern Ireland
peace talks after IRA's alleged involvement in two killings in
Belfast early last week.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam moved to expel Sinn Fein,
the political wing of the Irish Republican Army(IRA), by issuing an
indictment during the opening session of three days of talks in
Dublin, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein's seat at the peace talks has been in doubt since
the head of Northern Ireland's police last week linked the
IRA to the murder of two pro-British Protestants.
</P>
<P>
But Sinn Fein reacted angrily to the British government's move,
which raised fresh doubts about the chances of the talks yielding a
settlement to end three decades of violence that have claimed 3,200
lives.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams told reporters in Dublin that
London had made up its mind in advance.
</P>
<P>
"I know that the British government has decided to put us
out of these talks. We are going in there to listen to what they
have to say and to challenge what they have to say," Adams said.
</P>
<P>
The rules of the talks, which involve the British and Irish
governments and eight Protestant and Catholic parties, bar any
group if gunmen affiliated to it break a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
The pro-British Ulster Democratic Party was expelled from
the talks last month after gunmen it represents admitted killing
three Catholics. Britain and Ireland, its co-sponsor of the
talks, have been under pressure to treat Sinn Fein in the same
way.

<HEADLINE> Algeria Seeks to Normalize Relations with France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Algeria Monday expressed its
wish to normalize relations with France, which has been accused of
trying to interfere in Algeria's internal affairs, said a report.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Abdelaziz Sabaa, was
quoted as saying that Algeria wants to improve relations with
France on the basis of mutual respect, balance of interests and
non-interference in each other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
"The atmosphere was disturbed by France's attempts to interfere
in our internal affairs," Sabaa said.
</P>
<P>
He also complained that the Algerian-French mixed groups, set
up in 1996 for bilateral cooperation on political, economic and
humanitarian issues, have never held a meeting.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Algeria and France have cooled down since
Algerian militants killed a French Roman Catholic bishop in the
Algerian coastal city of Oran in August 1996.
</P>
<P>
Jack Lang, chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the
French National Assembly, paid a two-day visit to Algeria last
weekend, the first by a senior French politician this year.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Algiers, Lang met with Algerian Prime
Minister Ahmed Ouyahia and Foreign Minister Ahmed Attaf.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Inflation Rises Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's year-on-year
inflation has risen sharply early this year up 4.1 percentage
points over the December level, to 24.2 percent for January, the
Central Statistical Office said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Underpinned in increases in all other components of the consumer
price index except rent rates, fuel and power and education which
remained pegged at December levels,
</P>
<P>
The office said, "The proposed hike in fuel prices by the
Ministry of Transport and Energy recently is one of inflationary
factors that is going to impact on inflation for February."
</P>
<P>
This month's level was the fifth highest level since January 1996,
 and the highest since January 1997.
</P>
<P>
The highest level of inflation in 1997 was experienced in March
when it was pegged at 22.4 percent, while the lowest level of 14.4
percent was recorded in September.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, since independence in 1980, recorded an all time high
annual rate of inflation of 42.1 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The rate of inflation was rising as a result of a spate of
administered price increases, and the payment of former freedom
fighters' pensions, among others, continued to exert pressure on the
already strained economy.

<HEADLINE> ILO Report: Over 120 Countries Provide Paid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- More than 120 countries around the
world provide paid maternity leave and health benefits by law but
Australia, New Zealand and the United States are not among them,
according to a report released here Monday by the International Labor
Organization (ILO).
</P>
<P>
"In all parts of the world, working women who become pregnant are
faced with the threat of job loss, suspended earnings and increased
health risks due to inadequate safeguards for their employment," said
F.J. Dy-Hammar, chief of ILO Conditions of Work Branch, who oversaw
the report, Maternity Protection at Work.
</P>
<P>
The countries that provide the most paid maternity leave by law
include the Czech Republic, 28 weeks; Hungary, 24; Italy, 17; Canada,
17; Spain, 16; and Romania, 16.
</P>
<P>
Denmark, Norway, and Sweden all provide extensive paid leave which
may be taken by either parent, although a portion is reserved for the
mother.
</P>
<P>
The ILO surveys how its 152 member countries treat women of
child-bearing age in both law and practice, and how these countries'
legislation compares to ILO international standards. The report
analyses overall maternity protection at work, including maternity
leave, employment protection, cash and medical benefits and health
protection of mother and child.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 119 countries meet the ILO standard of 12 weeks with 62
of those countries providing for 14 weeks or more. Just 31 countries
mandate a maternity leave of less than 12 weeks.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Urges Iraq to Capitalize on Last-ditch Diplomacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
Monday Monday sent a message to the Iraqi leadership, urging it to
take advantage of a last-minute diplomacy to solve the U.N.-Iraqi
face-off peacefully, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In the message, which is the sixth since the crisis over
U.N. arms inspection broke out, he expounded the grave
consequences of the ongoing stand-off between Baghdad and the U.N..
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that he sent the message after contacting
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, who is widely expected to meet
Iraqi leaders in Baghdad on Wednesday to discuss ways of averting
a possible U.S. military punishment of Iraq whose refusal of full
access to U.N. arms inspectors has sparked the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"In the message, I urged the Iraqi regime to cash in on Annan's
coming visit to Baghdad as well as the international efforts and
Arab appeals to spare Iraq and the entire region the adverse
impacts in case force is used," he said.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Egyptian university students in the
Cairo southern suburb of Helwan, Mubarak said he appealed to the
Iraqi leadership to positively respond to this attempt, which, he
warned, "might be the last."
</P>
<P>
He also asked Annan to be "flexible enough" to reach an
agreement securing the implementation of Security Council
resolutions "under U.N. umbrella."
</P>
<P>
During the two-hour meeting, the president voiced his hope
that Iraq would respond during Annan's visit to the call of
implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has opposed military strikes to force Iraq's compliance
with the U.N. demand of full access to U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) in charge of scrapping Iraqi weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Annan has sent a three-men U.N. team to Baghdad to survey the
eight presidential sites previously off-limits to UNSCOM experts,
possibly as a prelude to his personal visit there.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN to Seek Clarification From Cambodian Parties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The ASEAN Troika will seek
clarification from conflicting Cambodian parties on the need for
the group to continue its role in restoring political stability to
the country, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) is seeking
clarification from the conflicting parties on whether we are
needed or not. They should not accuse us of intervening in their
internal affairs," Alatas said at the opening of the United
Nations Regional Disarmament Meeting here.
</P>
<P>
The decision to seek clarification was made by the ASEAN
Troika, which consists of the foreign ministers of Indonesia, the
Philippines and Thailand, following recent statements by Cambodian
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen that ASEAN had intervened in his
country's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN Troika met on Saturday to continue its mandate of
contributing to the restoration of political stability to
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN's ministers will not meet until they receive
clarification from Cambodia, Alatas said.
</P>
<P>
"However, we will still contact each other through other
channels," he added.
</P>
<P>
The troika also held a meeting on Sunday with the Friends of
Cambodia, an informal group of countries with interests in the
Cambodian situation and representatives of the U.N. Secretary
General in the country.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the Friends of Cambodia supported the
constructive role ASEAN was playing to restore political stability
to Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Both groups held that to ensure free, fair and credible
elections in Cambodia on July 26, all political forces and
Cambodian personalities should be allowed to participate.
</P>
<P>
The troika welcomed the decision of Prince Norodom Ranariddh to
return to Cambodia soon to participate in the elections. It also
hoped that King Norodom Sihanouk would return to Cambodia, as he
plays an important role as a unifying force for the Cambodian
people.

</P>
<P>
He said that in the 24 hours before his interview on Sunday
with the Mozambique News Agency, only four had been killed by
cholera, a big drop in the mortality of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Francisco attributed the better situation in controlling
cholera to improved health condition and the awareness of
citizens against the infectious disease, the Mozambique News
Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The highest daily death toll was 34, since the breakout of the
disease on January 24 in the port city of Beira.
</P>
<P>
About 544 have died since cholera was first reported in the
country in August last year. Of the 10 Mozambican provinces, five
provinces in the southern part of the country have registered
outbreak of the disease.

<HEADLINE> Himalayan Eco-meeting Opens in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 16 (Xinhua) -- A three-day Himalayan
Eco-regional Cooperation Meeting, which aims to tackle problems of
bio-diversity losses in the Himalayas, opened here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is being attended by key government officials,
representatives from non-governmental organizations from Bhutan,
China, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Pakistan as well as other
organizations, said a press release of the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP), which funds the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Opening the meeting, the first of its kind, U.N. Assistant
Secretary-General Dr. Nay Htun said nearly 2 billion people
directly or indirectly depend on Himalayan mountains for
livelihood.
</P>
<P>
"Because 50 percent of these populations live below the poverty
line, the challenge is to strike a balance between meeting the
needs of the poor and conserving a unique mountain eco-system of
the Himalayas," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that past experiences show conservation works best
when taken up as a trans-national concern.
</P>
<P>
He said he is hopeful that the meeting would lead to consensus
between and among the countries on the need for regional action,
identification of implementable projects and on working out
modalities for regional cooperation to preserve the Himalayas'
rich bio-diversity.
</P>
<P>
Participants from the six countries sharing the Himalayan
eco-system presented their individual country papers on the state
of bio-diversity in their countries and identified priority areas
in which regional cooperation can be enhanced, the UNDP press
release said.
</P>
<P>
Growing demand for fuel wood and other forest products,
pollution from industrialization, and a market for rare animal
species and medicinal plants all threaten biological diversity and
sustainable human development in the Himalayas, the UNDP said.
</P>
<P>
The World Wildlife Fund and the International Center for
Integrated Mountain Development will provide substantive technical
inputs to the meeting.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, Algeria Sign Military Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and Algeria
signed an agreement of intent on military cooperation in Pretoria
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by visiting Algeria's Army Chief of
Staff Mohamed Lamari, and South African Defense Minister Joe
Modise.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, South Africa will sell military equipment
and weapons to Algeria, and the two countries would cooperate in
military exchange programs.
</P>
<P>
Algeria did not need weapons from South Africa to fight Moslem
rebels trying to topple the government, Lamari told reporters
after he signed the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Algeria was interested in the Rooivalk attack
helicopters, Lamari indicated his country was impressed with the
South African products, but not as a means to crush Moslem rebel
groups.
</P>
<P>
South African arms manufacturer Denel announced last month
that it had signed a sales contract with Algeria for an unmanned
reconnaissance aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The deal drew criticism from churches and organizations in
South Africa, which fear an escalation of military equipment in
Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Modise said the agreement on military cooperation was not only
about buying and selling arms. It was about building a
partnership between the two sides to help realise the renaissance
of Africa, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the arms trade between the two countries
would not necessarily be limited to Algeria buying weapons from
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"We will do both," he said, adding that South Africa would not
necessarily go public should it buy weapons from Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Lamari denied there was a war in Algeria. The Algerian army
was merely helping to fight criminals hiding in bushes. The
criminals' attacks were part of a campaign to destabilize
Algeria, he said.
</P>
<P>
Algerian security forces have been fighting Moslem terrorists
since January 1992 when the authorities canceled a general
election that radical Islamists were expected to win.
</P>
<P>
At the weekend, suspected Moslem terrorists killed 21 people
in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Lamari is in South Africa for a working visit.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Visa Card Fraud Losses Fall to All-time Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Credit card fraud fell to an
all-time low in 1997 at Visa U.S.A. with stricter identification
and tracking procedures, USA Today reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Visa U.S.A. is America's biggest card network with more than 200
million cards throughout the United States and in some parts of the
world.
</P>
<P>
Fraud losses amounted to 499 million U.S. dollars, or eight cents
for every 100 U.S. dollars of charges in 1997, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
That's down from 11 cents in 1996, and 19 cents in 1992 and 1993,
the peak fraud years.
</P>
<P>
Visa card charges have been growing in recent years. Since 1993,
charge volume has jumped an average 24 percent a year, according to
the paper.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: First Phase of Indian Elections End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 16 (Xinhua) -- A voter turnout of 50 to 55
percent was registered in Monday's first phase of India's 12th
Lower House of Parliament elections in parts of the country, a
leading election official said.
</P>
<P>
Briefing newsmen here, Chief Election Commissioner M. S. Gill
described the just-concluded polling as a largely peaceful
exercise despite pre-polling fears of large-scale violence and a
low turnout.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 600 million voters have been registered for the
four-phase general elections on February 16, 22, 28 and March 7
and the whole process of holding elections and forming the next
government will be completed before March 15.
</P>
<P>
This is the second general election in the country in less than
two years and the last one was held in April-May, 1996. According
to the Indian Constitution, the tenure of each Lower House is five
years.
</P>
<P>
Indian President K. R. Narayanan dissolved parliament on
December 4, 1997 as no political party could muster enough support
to form the next government after the Gujral government tendered
its resignation.
</P>
<P>
The 18-month United Front (UF) government was forced to stand
down after the Congress, its main supporter, withdrew support for
it due to disputes over a Jain Commission report on former Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi's assassination in 1991.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Narayanan and his wife cast their ballots at a
polling station in a government school inside the president's
estate here. It is the first time in India's history an Indian
president voted in general elections.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, presidents do not vote in India. Narayanan's
press secretary, T.P. Seetharam, said the president had expressed
his desire to vote.
</P>
<P>
"To the best of our knowledge and available records," he was
the first president to cast his vote, said Seetharam.
</P>
<P>
Apprehensions were voiced about a low or moderate turnout
Monday as some voters showed apathy towards the elections due to
their disillusionment with candidates' promises.
</P>
<P>
Rachna, a student of Daulat Ram College in Delhi University,
said most of the political parties were fighting for power rather
than for a social cause.
</P>
<P>
Fed up with frequent elections and cynicism of politicians,
N.Y. Seshadri, who lives in the Mayur Vihar area in east Delhi,
said: "I refrained from exercising my right because i did not find
a suitable candidate."
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 security personnel from the paramilitary
forces as well as states' police were deployed to maintain the law
and order situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
A number of violent incidents were reported in Bihar, Assam,
Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and other states, and at least 18
people were killed and many others injured.
</P>
<P>
Some of the ballot boxes were snatched away by extremists or
rival party members. The Janata Dal, one of the UF constituents,
has demanded repolling in 81 polling stations in the Madheura
constituency of Bihar, alleging large-scale booth capturing by its
rival the Rashtriya Janata Dal.
</P>
<P>
Summing up the first phase polling, the chief election
commissioner said it was an anxious day but ultimately it turned
out to be a good day.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Greece Oppose Military Action Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Greece voiced Monday
their opposition to the use of military force against Iraq and
called for more steps to avert military action.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after talks with his Greek
counterpart Theodoros Pangalos, visiting Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov said that both Russia and Greece did not consider
the use of force to be expedient since this would have serious
repercussions in the broader region.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that all political possibilities for a settlement
of the current crisis in Iraq had not yet been exhausted and there
were still steps which could be taken to avoid military action.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the two countries agreed that Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction must be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Primakov regarded a possible visit to Baghdad by U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan as an encouraging first step in dealing with
the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief, he pointed out, should not go to Baghdad with
ultimatums, but to try and secure conditions which would enable
U.N. arms inspectors to do their job and to persuade Iraq to
neutralize its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pangalos also said that there was no agreement on a
policy of militarily tackling the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, who arrived here Sunday night for a four-day official
visit to Greece, will also meet with Greek President Costis
Stephanopoulos, Prime Minister Costas Simitis and Parliament
President Apostolos Kaklamanis to discuss matters of common
interest.

<HEADLINE> Reports on S. African Cloning Are Bogus: Doctor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 16 (Xinhua) -- A South African doctor,
who was quoted in a weekend newspaper as saying that he was
capable of cloning human beings, labeled the reports Monday as
bogus and ruinous to his reputation.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Cassim, a fertility expert who works at a clinic in
Johannesburg, was quoted extensively in the Saturday Star
newspaper as saying he and his medical team were preparing to
start mass cloning of human beings.
</P>
<P>
"I made no such claim," South African Press Association quoted
Cassim as reporting.
</P>
<P>
"The journalist and newspaper have inflated what I said, which
was that in theory we have the know-how to manufacture clones,
not that I was going to.
</P>
<P>
"I spoke to the journalist concerned on the understanding that
any capacity to produce clones was hypothetical. Medical
researchers put forward their claims by publishing academic
papers, not by taking it to a newspaper first," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cassim alleged that claims have come under attack from several
quarters, particularly from professionals and clerics.
</P>
<P>
"I have written to the newspaper's editor requesting a
withdrawal of the article. It makes me look like I am a
publicity-seeker, which I am not," he stressed.

ISLAMABAD, February 16 (Xinhua) -- A three-member delegation of
the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry
(FPCCI) left Monday for Dhaka to attend the annual meeting of the
Association of Shippers Councils of Bangladesh, India, Pakistan
and Sri Lanka (ASCOBIPS).
</P>
<P>
The meeting is scheduled for Tuesday. The delegation is led by

</P>
<P>
The last meeting of ASCOBIPS was held in Pakistan's southern

</P>
<P>
Important decisions were made at the Karachi meeting to expand
ASCOBIPS to other countries of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation, hold a series of seminars and regularly
exchange information among member countries, said the APP.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming meeting in Dhaka will review reports submitted
by member countries on implementation of the decisions made at the

<HEADLINE> UAE Opposes Use of Force Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates on
Monday expressed its opposition to the use of force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The UAE cabinet issued a statement after a weekly meeting
saying the UAE rejects a military strike against Baghdad and
calling for a peaceful solution to the standoff between Iraq and
the United Nations over arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
It stressed the necessity of "encouraging U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan to visit Iraq to touch by himself what Iraq has
done in the field of complying with U.N. Security Council's
resolution" and "what the Iraqi people suffered due to economic
sanctions."
</P>
<P>
The cabinet also praised efforts exerted by the Arab League and
other countries to defuse the U.N.-Iraq crisis through diplomatic
means.
</P>
<P>
The statement came amid growing danger of a U.S. military blitz
against Baghdad and expectation that Annan may visit Baghdad soon
on a mission to mediate a diplomatic end to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have been intensifying their military
build-up in the Gulf region in order to carry out threatened
attacks against Iraq in case that diplomatic efforts fail to
settle the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Of the six Gulf Arab countries, the UAE is the first to join
the chorus of Egypt-led Arab protests against possible U.S.
military actions.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman have pledged to support Washington by
agreeing to allow the U.S. warplanes to use their soil as
launching pads against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Qatar obviously have reservations on a
military strike; Riyadh has refused to be the springboard for the
U.S. operation.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Searchs for Robbers Knifing Briton to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan police are trying
hard to hunt down killers of a British holiday-maker who was
stabbed to death in one of Kenya's world-famous game parks,
Tourism Minister Henry Kosgey said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We are taking this unusual attack very seriously," said
Kosgey, vowing the government would do everything not only to
bring the killers to justice but also provide security.
</P>
<P>
Two men attacked Roy Chivers and his wife Sandra Sunday
morning when the couple were walking in a well-fenced private
game reserve belonging to the Aberdare Country Club, 230
kilometers north of capital Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The robbers, one of them holding a knife, demanded the couple
hand over their video camera. Roy was stabbed in the chest and
his wife was cut on the hand in the struggle.
</P>
<P>
The killers then escaped with two cameras, one of them later
found near the scene.
</P>
<P>
Roy was soon after taken to a local hospital for emergency
treatment then to Nairobi Hospital by a flying ambulance. Despite
all the medical efforts he died of cardiac arrest Sunday
afternoon, according to Kosgey.
</P>
<P>
"A team with tracker dogs is combing the area and making
enquiries...we are confident we will resolve the matter," he
said, declaring an offer of 50,000 Shillings (some 800 U.S.
Dollars) by the Kenya Association of Tour Operators for any
information leading to the arrest of the killers.

LONDON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Senior British defense sources
said here Monday that British troops in the Gulf are now ready to
launch air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A British defense source was quoted by the Reuters as saying
early Monday that British military preparations in the Gulf region
have completed and "We are ready to go now."
</P>
<P>
The defense sources made it clear that the object of any
military action against Iraq was to hit at Saddam's capability to
produce and conceal chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
"This is not just a military option. There is politics and
diplomacy in a twin track approach. The end game is to get the
UNSCOM (United Nations Special Commission) people back," one
senior source said.
</P>
<P>
There was no plan to punish the Iraqi people, who had suffered
enough, and nor was there any intention to destroy Iraq or
dismantle its borders, they added.

<HEADLINE> Iran Says US Wrestlers' Visit Has No Bearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Head of Iran's judiciary
Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi Monday ruled out that the coming trip of
American wrestlers to Tehran will influence relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The trip of an American wrestling team is separate from the
bilateral relations, Yazdi, the judicial supervisor-general, told
a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Five wrestlers and some sports officials from the U.S. will
come here soon to compete in an annual international tournament
which Iran stages to mark its 1979 Islamic Revolution which
toppled the late shah and brought about the rule of Islamic
clergymen.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. severed its relations with Iran soon after the Islamic
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Western reports have speculated that Washington and Tehran
might engage in "wrestling diplomacy" to improve their relations.
</P>
<P>
Yazdi, however, stressed that Iran does not need relations with
the U.S., as already made clear by President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the American people last month, Khatami said
Iran would not hold talks with the U.S. government and Iran does
not need a political relationship with the U.S. which refuses to
change its hostile policies toward Iran.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has accused Iran of sponsoring terrorism, attempting
to acquire weapons of mass destruction and opposing the Middle
East peace process. A harsh economic embargo against Iran was
already in place.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Yazdi also touched upon the case of a
German businessman, Helmut Hofer, who has been sentenced to death
on charges of having sexual relations with an Iranian Muslim woman.
</P>
<P>
Yazdi said Hofer's case was under re-examination after he
claimed that he had converted to Islam before having an affair
with the woman.
</P>
<P>
Hofer was arrested last September and sentenced to death
according to Islamic laws which ban sexual relations between a
non-Muslim man and a Muslim woman.
</P>
<P>
Germany has warned that the death sentence on Hofer would have
negative impact on bilateral relations. In a response, Iran said
the German merchant was tried on formal procedures in accordance
with the law.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people in the Sierra
Leone capital of Freetown Monday had their first normal working day
after almost nine months of civil disturbance.
</P>
<P>
Since coupists overthrew the legitimate government last May,
business in the city has been virtually in a standstill, with
government offices barely functioning and banks and shops closed after
burning and looting.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian-led west African peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG,
backed by tanks, broke into the capital after a week's fierce fighting
with the junta forces last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The sub-regional force is now disarming soldiers, policemen and
civilians carrying weapons in the city, and thousands of guns and
other ammunitions and military uniforms have been captured by ECOMOG
thanks to the cooperation of civilians, who have been identifying
people with weapons.
</P>
<P>
The successful disarmament is still going on and ECOMOG has
announced a firm control of the Freetown peninsula after three days of
mopping up exercise in the western part of the capital, a British
Broadcasting Corporation report monitored here said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
By the coming weekend, Freetown will be arms free, said a senior
ECOMOG officer.
</P>
<P>
According to ECOMOG Commander Maxwell Kobe, his troops are
ready to move out of Freetown into the provinces as the capital is
about to be secure.
</P>
<P>
To keep Freetown in good order, ECOMOG has also warned that
looters will be shot at sight.
</P>
<P>
The fleeing junta leader, Johnny Paul Koroma, earlier vowed to
fight back into the capital from the provinces.
</P>
<P>
But ECOMOG force commander Timothy Shelpidi said the
war against the junta is just the beginning, promising to pursue
the leaders of the defeated junta.

<HEADLINE> Qatar Undecided on Whether to Back Attack on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Qatari Foreign Ministry
spokesman Fwaz bin Ahmad Al Attuiyah said in Doha Monday that
Qatar has not yet decided whether it will back a possible military
strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference Monday afternoon shortly before
his departure for Iraq for a brief visit, Al Attuiyah said there
is no decision on whether to provide the U.S. with military
facilities for the attack.
</P>
<P>
"If Qatar provides such facilities, it will be clear and also
will be announced before that," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said the Gulf Arab countries are "seriously
concerned" over the current stand of the Iraqi government, warning
such a stand is "in disregard of the dangerous consequences."
</P>
<P>
The Gulf Conference Cooperation foreign ministers have agreed
in a meeting earlier last week that it is the Iraqi government
that must take the responsibilities of the dangerous consequences
which may be caused by its rejection of complying with
international resolutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have been intensifying their military
build-up in the Gulf region to shore up their threatened attack on
Iraq in case full and free access to all suspected weapons sites
is not granted to arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- France will join the envisaged
United Nations peacekeeping force in the Central African Republic,
which will replace an African peacekeeping force deployed in
Bangui since January 1997.
</P>
<P>
French ambassador to the Central African Republic Jean-Marc
Simon met last weekend with the country's president, Ange-Felix
Patasse, promising him that France will send a "small contingent"
of soldiers to provide logistical support and back-up in the
medical and health field to the U.N. force.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council will vote on February 23 on
the dispatch of a 1,400-man U.N. force to Bangui at the request of
United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
The Inter-African Mission of Supervision of the Bangui
Agreements (MISAB) will end its mission on March 15, but soldiers
from seven countries joining the MISAB are expected to continue
serving in the U.N. force.
</P>
<P>
The Central African Republic, one of the poorest in Africa, was
shaken by several mutinies in 1996 and is troubled by tribal
tension.
</P>
<P>
France will close its military barracks in the country and
withdraw its 1,400 soldiers as part of its troop re-deployment in
Africa.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Hopes Iraqi Crisis Ends Diplomatically </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait again expressed its
hope on Monday that the current Iraq crisis over U.N. arms
inspections can be solved through diplomatic means.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh
Sabah Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah said after a meeting with the National
Assembly's External Affairs Committee that Kuwait hopes the
ongoing diplomatic efforts would succeed.
</P>
<P>
His words echoed a statement of Kuwaiti Undersecretary of
Foreign Affairs Suleiman Majed Al-Shasheen Sunday that "a
military solution should only be adopted as the last resort."
</P>
<P>
Russia, France and several Arab countries have been involved
in a flurry of diplomatic activities to try to find a way out of
the dilemma.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan is expected to head for
Baghdad in a last-ditch bid to keep guns in the Gulf silent.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have been massing troops in the region and
Washington is rallying support for a military operation against
Iraq in the event that diplomatic efforts to defuse the tension
fail to end the Iraq-US stand-off.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, which was invaded by Iraqi troops which set off the
1991 Gulf War, is a close American ally in the Gulf region.
Presently the U.S. has six F-117A stealth fighter bombers and
1,500 troops deployed in the country and six more stealth planes
and 3,000 marine solders are still to arrive.
</P>
<P>
The Arab world as a whole is opposed to the use of force
against Iraq, but called for Baghdad's compliance with the
U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Sabah said the Baghdad regime would be responsible for
the consequences of its non-compliance with the international
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqi regime's refusal to allow this commission
(U.N. Special Commission in charge of eliminating Iraqi weapons of
mass destruction) to pursue its mission is in contrary to the will
of the world community which wants an end to this crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody wants to see a breakthrough in this crisis as soon
as possible," the minister added.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Insists on Diplomatic Means to Solve Iraqi Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia Monday
renewed its call to explore all diplomatic means in solving the
current Iraq-U.N. crisis and urged Baghdad to abide by all the
U.N. resolutions to avoid a U.S. military strike.
</P>
<P>
Saudi King Fahd Bin Abdul-Aziz stressed during a meeting of
Saudi Council of Ministers that the kingdom was insisting on the
necessity to exhaust all diplomatic means in a bid to avert the
military option, Saudi Press Agency said.
</P>
<P>
King Fahd said the position of the kingdom was based on its
keenness on putting an end to the suffering of the Iraqi people
and on safeguarding Iraq's unity and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Information Minister Fuad Faresi was quoted as saying
after the cabinet meeting that his country had to expound the
dangers of the Iraqi crisis, which has been escalating in light of
a huge U.S. and British military build-up in the region and Iraq's
refusal of the U.S. demand to grant the U.N. arms inspectors'
unfettered access to all suspected sites.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Crown Prince and deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ibn
Abdul Aziz called on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to reconsider
its position during a visit to Cairo last week.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has warned Iraq of grave consequences if
diplomatic efforts fail to defuse the tension over the standoff
over the inspection operations.
</P>
<P>
It also announced on several occasions that Iraq has to abide
by all the U.N. Security Council resolutions and expressed its
favor of a diplomatic solution to the crisis as the first option.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have threatened a military strike against
Iraq unless it gives full and unconditional access of U.N.
inspectors to all sites suspected of hiding banned weapons of
mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Meets Qatari Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
met with Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jaber
al-Thani on Monday, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Hamad conveyed a verbal message to Saddam
from Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa al-Thani, which deals
with the crisis over U.N. arms inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Qatar is the first Arab country to send its foreign minister to
Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War which drove Saddam's troops out of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival in Baghdad early in the day, Hamad said in a
statement that his visit is within the framework of a Qatari
initiative to discuss with the Iraqi side the latest developments
of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain have said they will launch air
strikes against Iraq unless it grants full and unfettered access
to U.N. arms inspectors to all suspected weapons sites.
</P>
<P>
Qatar has called for a peaceful solution to the Iraq crisis and
remains undecided on whether to back a U.S.-led military attack
should diplomatic efforts fail.
</P>
<P>
A Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Monday that if
Qatar supports a possible U.S. attack on Iraq, it will make an
announcement beforehand.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
met with Russian special envoy Viktor Posuvalyuk. Both of them
agreed to continue efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Posuvalyuk, who has been here since early this month, has said
that he will remain in Baghdad until the crisis is defused.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Supports Efforts to Resolve Iraqi Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Swedish Foreign Minister Lena
Hjelm-Wallen said here Monday that Jordanian and Swedish
viewpoints are identical in reaching a diplomatic solution for
the current crisis Iraq-U.N. over arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
"Sweden is a peace-loving country. We do not believe in
solving conflicts by the use of force," said Wallen before her
departure from Jordan after concluding a three-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
In light of the current situation, "we can not rule out a
military action but we will do everything possible to avoid the
ghost of war," said the minister at a press conference at the
Marqa Airport near Amman.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wallen urged the Iraqi government to think deeply
and understand the gravity of the situation and cooperate with
the U.N. to avert tragedy.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said, if a peaceful solution could not be
reached, then "we have to go back to the U.N. Charter to settle
this problem," and "military force can be used in such a
situation."
</P>
<P>
Wallen said that she had met Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahhaf here and tried to convince him that "the situation
is very serious."
</P>
<P>
Wallen kicked off her regional tour to help revive the
long-stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
As the United States warned that military action against Iraq
was imminent, a new round of international efforts headed by the
U.N. was drummed up to help solve the crisis through diplomatic
means.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan is expected to pay a visit to
Baghdad soon.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Explore New Ways for EU Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkey on Monday expressed its
readiness to try new and different ways to continue its efforts
for European Union (EU) membership, the Anatolia News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the EU Coordination Council, Turkish
State Minister Sukru Sina Gurel affirmed that Turkey is still
aiming to improve its relations with the EU, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
But Gurel stressed that the bilateral relations will be
improved only when the EU fulfills its obligations according to
the customs union agreement signed in 1995 between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"In the light of the evaluations, we are preparing proposals to
launch a new process of talks with the EU and to improve the
bilateral ties within the current framework," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen subcommittees under the EU Coordination Council have
been set up to study the issue, he added.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's relations with the EU dropped to the lowest level last
December when it was excluded from EU's enlargement process at the
Luxembourg summit of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
Ankara, angered by EU's decision, announced that it would
suspend political dialogue with the EU to protest against its
unjust attitude toward the Muslim-dominant nation.
</P>
<P>
Gurel reiterated that the launching of a new process for EU
membership does not mean a change of Turkey's position on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, this decision will be maintained unless the EU
revise its stance," he said.
</P>
<P>
Though the Turkish government has announced a halt of political
talks with the EU, it has made it clear that Turkey will continue
to develop bilateral ties with the EU members.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been making efforts for its long-cherished goal to
join the EU through bilateral contacts with its member states,
especially those with a key role as Germany and France.
</P>
<P>
The EU criticizes Turkey for its poor human rights record,
bitter relationship with Greece and its stand on the Cyprus
issue.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Supreme Court Begins Hearings on Quebec Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Canada
began a landmark hearing Monday on whether the French-speaking
province of Quebec has the right to secede unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
The week-long hearing is expected to let the court rule, months
from now, on whether unilateral secession is legal under either
domestic or international law, and if the two conflicts, which law
prevails.
</P>
<P>
Canada's federal government initiated the court case 18 months
ago in a bid to lay down legal rules for the political battle over
Quebec separation.
</P>
<P>
The move is seen as a key part of Ottawa's strategy of
challenging separatists arguments that Quebec has a right to
separate regardless of the views of the rest of Canada.
</P>
<P>
The Quebec government is officially boycotting the case, saying
that separation is a political issue rather than a legal issue and
that the court should not hear the case.
</P>
<P>
Premier Jean Chretien's government is using a biased court to
try to rob Quebecers of their democratic right to determine their
own future, it argued.
</P>
<P>
"The last word belongs not to one man, not to one government,
not to one text imposed from on high.... The last word belongs to
Quebec democracy, to the Quebec people," declared Quebec Premier
Lucien Bouchard.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 16 (Xinhua) -- French state secretary for
economy, finance, industry and foreign trade, Jacques Dondoux,
ended a three-day visit to Saudi Arabia Monday on boosting trade
relations and encouraging joint investments.
</P>
<P>
According to the Kuwait news agency, Dondoux and Saudi Minister
of Petroleum and Mineral Resources Ali Al-Naimi all expressed
desire to expand joint cooperation in the energy fields during
their talks on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Presently a number of French companies are working in Saudi
petroleum services fields under contracts involving more than 700
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the French official also met Saudi Minister of
Industry and Electricity Hashim Yamani on means of expanding
joint investment projects.
</P>
<P>
He had held two separate meetings with Saudi ministers of
trade and communication, and reviewed possibilities of enhancing
trade and investment exchange between the two countries in
addition to cooperation in the fields of rail roads and
transportation.
</P>
<P>
Dondoux, who arrived in Saudi Arabia Saturday night, discussed
with Saudi Minister of Agriculture and Water Abdullah Bin Moammer
on Sunday on means of fostering joint cooperation relations in
trade, agricultural, animal and food industries fields.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to hold joint studies and researches in the
field of water rationalization and desalination.
</P>
<P>
Economic cooperation between Saudi Arabia and France have been
progressing, with their trade volume reaching nearly 22 billion
French Francs (about 4 billion U.S. dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
French imports from Saudi Arabia in 1996 jumped by nearly 15
percent compared with 1995, while its exports to the country rose
by 9 percent.

<HEADLINE> Iran Optimistic About Political Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said Tuesday that a political solution to the ongoing
Iraqi crisis is close.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Iranian official news agency IRNA, Kharrazi
hoped that the imminent trip of the U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan to Baghdad would be successful.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council reportedly was getting close to a
decision on whether Annan would visit Iraq to mediate a political
solution to the standoff between the U.N. and Baghdad over arms
inspection.
</P>
<P>
On the likelihood of the U.S. military attack on Iraq,
Kharrazi said "I cannot say whether or not an attack will be
launched but we should try our best to avert it."
</P>
<P>
"The presence of alien forces in the region is serious and
they are ready for action (against Iraq)," he said. "But the
international community is in principle against military
operations and I think that diplomacy is the correct way to
end the crisis."
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said Iran, as the chairman country of the Organization
of the Islamic Conference, has done all within its ability to
convince Iraqi officials to give the U.N. inspection team free
access to various sites in the country.
</P>
<P>
Iran is consulting with various countries to prevent a military
attack on Iraq and to pave the way for a diplomatic solution by
allowing the U.N. team to inspect suspected Iraqi weapon sites.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday morning, Kharrazi also attended a closed session of
the Iranian Majlis (Parliament) to briefed the members on the
developments of the Iraqi crisis.

HONG KONG, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Witnesses reported spatters

</P>
<P>
It said the reports came from Tuen Mun and Kam Tin of "New

The hailstones were said to be the size of small peas with
diameters ranging from 0.5 to two centimeters. In each case, they
lasted only a few minutes, the observatory said.

<P>
From past records, hail was not uncommon in Hong Kong, normally
occurring in the months of February to April during the transition

</P>
<P>
In post-war years, the observatory said, there have been 27
reports of hail, averaging once every couple of years.
</P>

Hailstones were also reported in April last year but the last
occurrence in February had to go back to the year 1985, it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's new Kuala
Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) was put on trial operation on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 volunteers posed as passengers and checked in for
flights to various overseas destinations as part of the trial
operation Tuesday which was "generally smooth," airport terminal
manager Haji Hamid Awang said.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,200 pieces of luggage were handled during the three-hour
operations.
</P>
<P>
The airport built at a cost of 9 billion ringgit (about 2.36
billion U.S. dollars) is located about 50 Kilometers south of
Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
There are 46 gates at the main terminal. For passenger
processing there are six check-in islands with 216 counters, 69
immigration and 61 emigration counters, 16 transfer counters and
26 customs counters. Passenger movements will be monitored
through 1,300 close-circuit cameras, according to the manager.
</P>
<P>
The most unique feature of the KLIA is the Total Airport
Management System (TAMS), the "heart" of the airport operations,
which is the first such system to be utilized in the world. The
system can coordinate and integrate about 30 information and
operational databases.
</P>
<P>
The new KLIA is scheduled to put into operation by the end of
the first quarter of this year.

"The bronze plaque and ivory cup with animal mask designs
inlaid with turquoise were so exquisitely done," he added.
</P>
<P>
Li was also impressed by the terracotta warriors of the Qin
Dynasty, saying: "It's so different when you can examine them
closely and the impact is beyond words."

The exhibition, which was opened by Tung Chee Hwa, chief
executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China,
on December 15 last year, is scheduled to close on March 1 this
year.
</P>
<P>
The historical relics will be shipped back to more than 30
museums and institutions in the Chinese inland areas.

<HEADLINE> AL Chief Meets Iraqi Delegate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdel Meguid met Tuesday with Iraqi permanent delegate to
the League Nabiel Nejm to discuss the current diplomatic drive to
avert a military strike in the Iraq-U.N. face-off.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting mirrored Iraq's keenness on posting the AL chief
and Arab sister countries on U.S. escalation of the current
U.N.-Iraq standoff," Nejm told the Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Nejm added that he was briefed by Abdel Meguid on the outcome
of his sustained efforts and contacts with international parties
and also with U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan in a bid to
contain the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's rejection of full access to the U.N. Special Commission
on scrapping Iraqi weapons of mass destruction has sparked the
current crisis and prompted a U.S. threat of a military
punishment.
</P>
<P>
The Arab body has stood firm beside Russia, France, China and
other countries in searching for a peaceful solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Nejm said he informed Abdel Meguid on the results of the visit
paid by the personal envoy of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to
some Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
"This Iraqi drive reflected Baghdad's keenness on exchanging
views with the Arab leaders and to brief them on the grave
situation resulting from the U.S. threats and escalations which
pose perils against national Iraqi and Arab security," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed the AL chief on the Iraqi response to the
Russian initiative to solve the Iraqi crisis, which receives the
support of several of the U.N. Security Council permanent member
states, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi delegate stressed Baghdad's firm stance that calls
for reaching a diplomatic solution to the crisis that ensures
Iraq's sovereignty.

<HEADLINE> Two Guinea Players Banned For One Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOME, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Two Guinean players were banned
for one year by the African Football Confederation (CAF) for
misdemeanor on court towards match officials in Ouagadougou,
Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
And CAF also fined Guinea 500 U.S. dollars because players
smashed the glass door to their dressing room, another 500 dollars
for arriving late for the start of the match.
</P>
<P>
Morlaye Soumah, a defender playing in Bastia in France, and
goalkeeper Kemoko Camara were accused of misconduct at the end of

CAF for joining the misdemeanor and had been suspended from the
national side's next two competitive matches.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Israeli Air Force on Alert over Iraq Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Air Force Commander
Eitan Ben-Eliahu said Tuesday that the air force is on alert to
prepare for a possible deterioration of situation in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to high school students in the central town of Beit
Shemesh, Ben-Eliahu said the air force was responding to the
current developments in the Gulf, where tensions between Iraq and
the United States continued to escalate over weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
However the general added Israel's assessment remained that an
Iraqi missile attack on Israel is not likely. His statement echoed
earlier remarks made by senior army officers that Israel's
security situation has not changed regarding the Gulf situation.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted the unnamed officers as saying that Israel
believes that if the U.S. launches a strike on Iraq, Baghdad will
not necessarily attack Israel in retaliation.
</P>
<P>
Noting the difference between the current situation and that
duing the 1991 Gulf War, the officers further pointed out that,
even if Iraq will try to attack Israel, it is doubtful if it could
succeed in doing so.
</P>
<P>
Israel has repeatedly voiced its determination to retaliate
against any Iraqi missile attack, probably with air strikes.
Israel owns the strongest air force in the Middle East, and its
recent acquirement of first two advanced F-15I long-range strike
airplanes has greatly strengthened its air deterrence.
</P>
<P>
Although Israeli leaders continued to assure its citizens that
the possibility of being attacked by Iraq is very low, most people
do not want to take a chance. Some have already begun storing
protection kits, including gas masks, medicines and plastic tapes,
to prepare for a biological and chemical attack.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Eli Suissa Tuesday toured Israeli Army's
Home Front to review the civil preparedness, with which he
expressed satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
Since the Iraqi crisis erupted, Israeli Home Front has handed
out over 300,000 gas masks, and the sirens around the country have
all been checked. Late this week, the government will begin
issuing gas masks to foreign diplomats, workers and tourists.
</P>
<P>
To meet the shortage of supply, Israel has either purchased or
received as gifts over 400,000 gas masks from European countries.
On Tuesday, a first U.S. Air Force plane loaded with special
medicines and medical equipment landed in Israel.
</P>
<P>
In the coming days, more U.S. planes will land to deliver all
the other emergency medical supplies that Israel has purchased.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Defense Minister Meets Australian Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Defense
Minister Chi Haotian held talks with Australian Defense Department
Secretary-General Paul Barratt here Tuesday on bilateral military
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The 30-minute meeting took place after Chi made a speech
explaining China's defense policy at the Australian College of
Defense and Strategic Studies.
</P>
<P>
"The basic goals of China's defense policy are to consolidate
national defense, resist foreign aggression, defend the nation's
sovereignty over its territorial land, sea and airspace as well as
its maritime rights and interests and safeguard national unity and
security," he said in his address.
</P>
<P>
"China does not seek hegemony or foreign expansion. China does
not establish military alliance with any other country in the
world, nor does it station its troops or set up military bases on
foreign soil," said the Chinese defense minister, who is visiting
the country at the invitation of his Australian counterpart Ian
McLachlan.
</P>
<P>
"China attaches great importance to the security environment in
the region and has all along dedicated itself to promoting
dialogue and cooperation with all countries in the region," Chi
said.
</P>
<P>
He called for a new security concept in the post-Cold War era,
adding that the right way of safeguarding one's own and regional
security is to enhance trust through dialogue, seek security
through cooperation, respect each other's sovereignty, resolve
disputes through peaceful means, and seek common development.
</P>
<P>
"It has been proven that the security system in the Cold War
period, which is characterized by making military alliance as its
foundation and the enhancement of military armament as its means,
could not help create peace," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Chi, the first Chinese defense minister to visit Australia,
arrived in Canberra from Sydney Tuesday morning and was met at
Canberra military airport by Australian Defense Force Chief John
Baker.
</P>
<P>
Chi reviewed a guard of honor of the three services at the
airport soon after his arrival.
</P>
<P>
Chi is scheduled to hold talks with McLachlan Wednesday on a
wide range of issues and will also meet with Australian Prime
Minister John Howard and Foreign Minister Alexander Downer.
</P>
<P>
McLachlan said last Friday he would tell his Chinese guest that
Australia supports China playing an active and constructive part
in the developing regional security dialogue process.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers are also expected to review defense
activities between Australia and China. Over the past year, they
have included exchange of visits by senior defense officials, the
establishment of an annual strategic dialogue and the resumption
of naval ship visits.
</P>
<P>
Chi's visit will last until Thursday.

<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's Mayor Jia Qinglin,
in a meeting today with Kuek Leng Hai, the general manager of the
Hong Kong-based Guoco Group, a subsidiary of Malaysia's Leong
Group, said he welcomes more cooperation with the group.
</P>
<P>
Jia said the Hong Leong Group is in a good position to invest
in large projects in Beijing's financial street, which is taking
shape.
</P>
<P>
Kuek expressed satisfaction with progress in a world business
building on the street, and said his company has always had close
ties with China. Since 1984, it has put one billion US dollars worth
of investment in industry, urban construction, finance, and real
estate in Guangdong and Jiangsu provinces, and in Shanghai and
Beijing, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jia said that the financial turmoil in Southeast Asia will not
have much of an impact on Beijing, and the city still expects an
increase in foreign investment. He said he hopes the Hong Leong
Group will establish hi-tech industrial, tourism, modern
agriculture, and real estate businesses in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The world enterprise building is Hong Leong's first
jointly-funded project in Beijing, with total investment of 220
million US dollars. It is scheduled for completion by the third
quarter of this year.

<HEADLINE> China Verifying Assets Of Collectively-Run Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- China's Vice-Premier Wu
Bangguo told a national meeting today via phone that local
governments need to do a good job in verifying assets of
collectively-owned enterprises in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that verifying the assets of collectively-owned
enterprises is important for the future development of these
enterprises because it can reveal problems and contradictions that
are counter-productive to growth.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that government economic policy supports the
collectively-owned economy, which has turned out to be a major
place to find jobs for workers who have been laid off by state-run
firms.
</P>
<P>
Wu asked local governments to show more concern for the
collective economy by doing the verification work well and helping
those enterprises solve some of their problems.
</P>
<P>
China's verification work will go on a national basis this
year, after two years of experiments in some pilot cities.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines and Myanmar
signed four agreements here Tuesday on cultural exchanges, human
resources development, investment protection and visa exemption.
</P>
<P>
The agreements were signed after talks between visiting Myanmar
State Peace and Development Council Chairman Than Shwe and
Philippine President Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
Than Shwe, who arrived here Tuesday for a two-day state visit,
and Ramos witnessed the signing of the agreements.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Than Shwe, Ramos said the agreements
would facilitate the travel of officials between the two countries
and foster better understanding between the two peoples through
exchange of cultural groups.
</P>
<P>
The agreements would also promote and protect investments in
each country and allow the Philippines to help Myanmar develop its
human resources to facilitate its transition to a market-oriented
economy, Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
"I have recently approved the release of 5 million pesos
(125,000 U.S. dollars) to finance a program that will train up to
60 Myanmar citizens in institutions in the Philippines and in
Myanmar in various areas," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed to do more if the two countries are to
face the challenges posted by under-development and poverty,
environmental degradation, threats to security and economic
stability.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed the financial crisis sweeping East and
Southeast Asia and called for unity in the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).

NAGANO, Japan, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Skaters, skiiers, jumers
from South korea, the Netherland, Japan and Germany all displayed
their top performances on the 11th day of the Olympic Winter Games,
smashing two world records and sweeping in showpiece events.
</P>
<P>
South koreans dominated the short track speed skating, winning two
golds at stake in the men's 1,000m sprint and the women's 3,000m relay
with a world record time.
</P>
<P>
Dutch skaters, armed with flap skates, had a 1-2-3 finish in the
men's 10,000m speed skating with Gianni Romme winning the gold, also
at world record time.
</P>
<P>
Japanese ski jumpers got their biggest victory when they won the
team ski jumping -- the 100th gold medal for the country in Winter and
Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Germany, led by skiing legend Katja Seizinger, had a clean sweep of
medals in the women's combined event. It was the second gold for
Seizinger in two days.
</P>
<P>
With the victory, Seizinger became the second woman to win three
Olympic titles after Vreni Schneider of Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
In the opening events of the short track skating, Kim Dong-sung of
South Korea edged his long-time rival China's Li Jiajun to win the
men's 1,000m sprint in the finishing line. Kim was timed one minute
and 32.375 seconds while Li was second at 1:32.428. Eric Bedard of
Canada finished third in the 1:32.661.
</P>
<P>
Following the stormy victory of their male counterparts, the South
Korean girls added the second gold with a record-breaking victory in
the women's 3,000m relay. They were clocked four minutes and 16.260
seconds for the gold and a new world mark, slapping their own world
record of 4:17.630 set in Beijing in 1996. Chinese girls were second
at 4:16.383 and Canadians third at 4:21.205.
</P>
<P>
Dutch skater Romme, who won the men's 5,000m with a world record
breaking skating on the second day of the games, shattered the
four-year-old world record in the men's 10,000m in 13 minutes and
15.33 seconds. The previous record of 13:30.55 was set by Johann Olav
Koss of Norway in the last Winter Olympics in Lillehammer.
</P>
<P>
His compatriots Bob de Jong and Rintje Ritsma finished second and
third respectively.
</P>
<P>
Japanese ski jumpers Takanobu Okabe, Hiroya Saito, Masahiko Harada
and Kazuyoshi Funaki fulfilled Japan's dream on the day, defeating
Germany in the K120 ski jump team event.
</P>
<P>
Their hope of the gold was almost smashed when Harada flied only 79
meters in his first jump. But he geared up to fly a record distance
of 137 meters in his second leap.
</P>
<P>
After six-day competitions, the United States defeated Canada 3-1
to win the gold medal of the women's ice hockey, which made its debut
in winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
In the play-off for the third place, Finland roared back from one
goal down to beat China 4-1 earlier Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
When the Americans celebrate their victory in the women's ice
hockey, the men's ice hockey defending champion Sweden lost an appeal
to reinstate veteran Ulf Samuelsson after the International Ice Hockey
Federation (IIHF) disqualified him early Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The IIHF Directorate announced that the 34-year-old New York
Rangers player wad disqualified because his Swedish citizenship was
nullified under Swedish law after he acquired American citizenshhip.
</P>
<P>
An arbitration panel also dismissed Czech Republic's appeal to
strip Sweden of their games in the round robin.
</P>
<P>
The men's 10km biathlon, which was scheduled for Tuesday, was
postponed to Wednesday due to dense fog and heavy snow.
</P>
<P>
After the 11 day competitions, Russia led the medal table with
eight golds. Germany was second at seven and Norway stood third at
five.

JAKARTA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
will install Sjahril Sobirin on Thursday as the new governor of
the Indonesian central bank to replace Soedradjat Djiwandono,
State Secretary/Minister Moerdiono said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea of what is in the president's mind. But during
my conversation with Soedradjat, he expressed his wish to devote
himself to academic life, particularly in a university," the
Antara News Agency quoted Moerdiono as saying.
</P>
<P>
Moerdiono said the replacement is taking place in two days
since Djiwandono is about to complete his term of office.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto summoned Djiwandono Tuesday morning to the head of
state's residence and informed him about the decision which was
made on February 11, Moerdiono said.
</P>
<P>
Before his installation as Bank Indonesia's governor,
Djiwandono was junior minister of trade.
</P>
<P>
Sobirin, 55, started his career at Bank Indonesia as a general
staff member of the Economics and Statistics Division in 1969. In
1983, he became head of the Balance of Payment Department and two
years later, he was appointed head for banking supervisory. In
1986, he became acting head of economics and statistics affairs.
</P>
<P>
He first served as Bank Indonesia director in 1987-1992. In the
next five years, however, he worked as an economist at the World
Bank.
</P>
<P>
He again assumed the post of Bank Indonesia director on
December 23 last year.

<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Most of China's power grids
will be interconnected before the year 2020 to provide more power
nationwide, according to Huo Ji'an, deputy general manager of the
State Power Grid Development Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The country's fast-growing economy has brought new power
development in the form of large capacity generators and 6 large
grids and a group of provincial grids, with 567,000 km of power
transmission lines.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Power project will allow for a nationwide

<HEADLINE> Beijing Holds Forum To Discuss Deng Xiaoping's Ideas On Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- At a forum to discuss Deng
Xiaoping's ideas on population here today, Chinese State
Councillor Peng Peiyun said that further study of Deng's ideas is
vital for China's family planning program.
</P>
<P>
Peng said that Deng examined the population question in
conjunction with the national economy and social development and
that his population concept is an important component of Deng
Xiaoping Theory and a good explanation of the population question,
and when he set the goals of China's economic development, he
set out clear goals for population controls.
</P>
<P>
Deng also reminded people of the country's problems with per
capita grain production, land area, and GNP, she said, and he
placed a great deal of emphasis on population control, while
discussing the importance of improving the quality of life.
</P>
<P>
In the past two decades, China has explored ways of solving its
population problem with Chinese characteristics by following
Deng's ideas, and the third generation of Chinese leaders, with
Jiang Zemin at the core, has carried his ideas on.
</P>
<P>
Peng, who is also minister in charge of the State Family
Planning Commission, said that family planning departments at all
levels should conscientiously study Deng's population ideas, and
create a favorable environment for China's economic and social
development.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Defense Minister Refutes "China Threat Theory" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Defense
Minister Chi Haotian Tuesday described the so-called "China Threat
Theory" as a "fallacy" spread by people with ulterior motives and
reiterated that a stronger China will not pose a threat to any
country in the world.
</P>
<P>
In an address at the Australian College of Defense and
Strategic Studies, Chi said some people in the world have
continuously spread the theory in an attempt to sow discord
between China and its neighboring countries, defame china's image
in the international arena and contain China's development.
</P>
<P>
According to the theory, once China gets strong, it will pose a
threat to other countries and become the factor of instability in
the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
"It is known to all that the modern history of China is a
history of surrendering its territory to be annexed and leaving
its people to be invaded, plundered and enslaved by foreign
powers," Chi said.
</P>
<P>
"As an old soldier who has experienced the hard time of war in
the first half of this century, I am well aware of the indelible
scar in the hearts of the Chinese people left by that painful
period of history."
</P>
<P>
"This hardship suffered by the Chinese people in modern history
should never be allowed to be repeated in China or elsewhere," the
minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Peace should be enjoyed by all people in the world. China will
not take the road of expansionism even when it becomes strong in
the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our friends can rest assured that when China is developed and
becomes strong, it will not pose a threat to any country. On the
contrary, it will surely make greater contribution to mankind as
an important force of safeguarding world peace and stability," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Chi said that if China, which has one quarter of the world's
population, was plagued by lasting poverty and backwardness,
failed to develop, came across big turmoil and produced large
numbers of refugees, it would become a real "threat" and seriously
affect peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and the
world as a whole.

<HEADLINE> France: Peaceful Solution to Iraqi Crisis Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 17 (Xinhua) -- France still sees that there is
hope for averting the military option in the Iraqi-U.N. face-off,
French Ambassador to Egypt Jean Marc De La Sabliere told the
Middle East News Agency Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq made some progress regarding the implementation of the
U.N. resolutions but not as fully as required," the ambassador
added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq should move quickly as time passes rapidly, he warned.
</P>
<P>
France is still exerting strenuous efforts to find out a
diplomatic solution to ensure the implementation of the
U.N. Security Council resolutions and inspection operations while
respecting Iraq's sovereignty and dignity, De La Sabliere added.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador voiced France's concern over the grave
consequences the ongoing Iraqi-U.N. crisis could lead to.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's rejection of full access to the U.N. Special Commission
in charge of scrapping Iraq's weapons of mass destruction has
sparked the current stand-off.
</P>
<P>
France and Russian have pioneered the intensive diplomatic
drive to avert the threatened U.S. military strike to force the
Iraqi compliance with the U.N. arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
The military strike will of course have an impact on the
Mideast peace process, De La Sabliere added, noting that time is
premature to assess events.
</P>
<P>
"France, like Egypt, hopes that the visit of U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan to Iraq would take place as soon as possible as
we are confident that he could achieve positive results, thanks to
the flexibility which Annan enjoys," he added.
</P>
<P>
France is against the partition of Iraq and will work for
increasing Iraqi oil exports for humanitarian reasons, he added.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, French President Jacques Chirac believes a
diplomatic solution to the Iraqi crisis is "technically" close at
hand and urged Annan to go to Iraq swiftly to help defuse the
emergency.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, U.N. Security Council failed to endorse a peace
mission by Annan but planned to consider the issue again on
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> New Securities Trading System Put Into Use At Late Date </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Stock Exchange
announced today that it will postpone the opening of what it calls
a designated securities trading system until a later date to allow
more time for preparation.
</P>
<P>
The so-called designated system is designed to control risk and
stop securities-related crimes, according to SSE
sources.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, every securities investor must designate
one securities agency as his or her agent for trading and
settlement and put the agent's seat number on the SSE floor in his
or her securities trading account.
</P>
<P>
The SSE said it will start the designated securities trading
system on April 1, instead of March 1 as was planned, so that
securities agents and traders can have more time to get used to it.
</P>
<P>
It is also saying that securities agents must set up data banks
for their clients and properly keep the account numbers and data
information.

percent respectively, he added.

"Despite the success attained, the burden of overpopulation
looms large on Bangladesh," he said, adding that "poverty,
unemployment, malnutrition, illiteracy and poor sanitation have
been continuously plaguing the prospect of planned parenthood."
</P>
<P>
"We need to improve the quality of services to improve the
utilization of the resources and the existing infrastructure to
decrease maternal and child mortality," the minister stressed.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China's Propaganda Chief on "Colorful Socialist Culture" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- At a meeting of the China
Federation of Literary and Art Groups here today, Ding Guan'gen, a
member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) and the head of its publicity
department, said that the country's artists and writers need to
create a more colorful socialist culture.
</P>
<P>
Ding said that 1998 is a crucial year for China's reforms,
opening-up, and modernization construction, and asked artists and
writers to follow the guidelines of last fall's 15th National
Party Congress in their work.
</P>
<P>
Artists need to be encouraged to increase the study of Deng
Xiaoping Theory on art and the Party's general secretary Jiang
Zemin's speeches on art, he said, adding that they need to use
Deng Xiaoping Theory to understand life and guide their creation.
</P>
<P>
Artists are being encouraged to devote themselves to the
country's reforms, opening-up, and modernization drive, he said,
adding that they need to "be able to feel the pulse of the times
and absorb its nutrition."
</P>
<P>
They need to create good works to inspire people to devote
themselves to the great cause of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, he said, and that the arts should serve the
people and socialism. Ding also said the artists should continue
to "let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought
contend."
</P>
<P>
Ding asked artists to draw up careful plans for a number of
good films, TV dramas, plays, music pieces, and dances for the
50th anniversary of the People's Republic of China next year.

country does not believe military action against Iraq will cxange

The Foreign Minister said the mandate of the United Nations to

<P>
NEW DELHI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Four children were killed in
a blast Tuesday in the suburbs of Coimbatore city in Tamil Nadu,
southern India, police said.
</P>
<P>
The explosion happened when the children noticed an abandoned
bag in a corner of a playground and opened it out of curiosity.
</P>
<P>
This was feared to be the beginning of a new wave of blasts as
the city had been rocked by two series of blasts on Saturday and
Sunday, killing at least 46 people and injuring more than 100
others.
</P>
<P>
The first series of 15 bomb blasts on Saturday occurred minutes
before an election meeting held by President of the Bharatiya
Janata Party (BJP) L. K. Advani, who escaped unhurt as his
scheduled flight was delayed three hours that day. The involvement
of some fundamentalist organizations was suspected in the blasts.
</P>
<P>
Two blasts on Sunday rocked the city again, killing six
suspected extremists and injuring a bystander near a shop in a
commercial hub. Police captured eight militants and seized some
explosives.

<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Silver Land Hotel of
Dongguan in south China's Guangdong Province and other nine
Chinese hotels today joined Days Inns of America, Inc., the
world's largest hotel chain.
</P>
<P>
Days Inn, which started in 1970, has become a worldwide name,
with 1,800 franchises and more than 160,000 rooms catering mainly
to the middle-class market. Days Inn (China) Holdings Ltd., whose

interior parts of China and in Hongkong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
According to Yue Yang, managing director of Days Inn China, the
majority of its Chinese holdings are three-star hotels in major
tourist destinations and coastal cities like Beijing, Shanghai,
Xi'an, Dalian, and Qingdao. They will carry the Days Inn logo and
adopt its management methods, and be linked with air ticket
agencies in China and in other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are under way on cooperating with Chinese civil
aviation authorities and with other hotels in China, Yue
says. According to one plan, over 100 Chinese hotels are expected
to join Days Inn in 1998, making it the largest hotel franchise in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The immediate goal is to develop Days Inn hotels in major
cities and gradually in cities with a population of more than
500,000, he said.

<HEADLINE> Khamenei Condemns US Military Threat to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Iranian supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei Tuesday strongly condemned the military
presence of the United States in the Gulf region and its threat to
strike on Iraq, Tehran radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a mass of people in Iran's southern port city of
Bandar Abass on the Persian Gulf, Khamenei termed the
U.S. presence in the Gulf as "illegal," saying that Washington's
possible attack on Iraq would only create instability, calamity
and disputes in the region.
</P>
<P>
On an inspection to the Hormozgan province on the northeastern
coast of the Persian Gulf, Khamenei noted that the objectives
behind the U.S. military deployment in the region was to
strengthen its presence in the region and to test its
newly-developed weapons on the innocent Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian nation and government well realized the nature of
the U.S., he said, adding that the U.S. is a "great Satan" as late
(Iranian supreme leader) Imam Khomeini stated.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said that the Gulf region is sensitive for all
countries in the world, the regional states in particular, adding
that foreign military presence in the region is a threat to all
the regional countries.
</P>
<P>
Iran does not feel any threat so far, he said, adding that
Iran will answer any threat with all its strength if it feels
any threat.
</P>
<P>
With the escalation of tensions between the U.S. and Iraq over
U.N. arms inspection, Iran expressed serious concern over the
possible impacts of the U.S. military strike on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-Iraq standoff was triggered by Iraqi refusal to allow
U.N. weapons inspectors free access to sites suspected of
hiding banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials believed that Washington has the intention
to disintegrate Iraq and to install a pro-Washington regime to
replace the government of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Doctor Discover Way To Relieve Cancer Pain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- A doctor in south China's
Guandong Province has discovered a method of controlling the
severe pain caused by cancer.
</P>
<P>
After four years of research, Dr. Liu Linghui, a neurosurgeon
at the Guangzhou No. 1 People's Hospital, found the key to the
precise spot in the brain causing the pain, using magnetic
resonance, according to Monday's Yangcheng Evening News from
Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Liu then isolated the core and prevented the pain stimulus from
entering cerebral vesicle. The surgery does not harm the patients'
memory, language ability, or muscle function.
</P>
<P>
After surgery, patients can still feel pain from other sources
than cancer.
</P>
<P>
There are more than seven million people sufferering from
cancer in the world each year, and about four million of them
suffer from severe pain. The World Health Organization has urged
international medical researchers to try to find a solution to
this problem before the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Threatens Attack Against Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian militant
group Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) Tuesday threatened to
launch suicide attack against Israel if the United States strikes
on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in the West Bank city of Ramallah, Hamas'
military wing Izzadin Kassim declared that Hamas "will not sit
and do nothing in the face of American aggression against Iraq or
any other Arab country."
</P>
<P>
The statement said the Hamas response to such aggression would
be an attack against Israel, which it called "Zionist enemy."
</P>
<P>
In the past, Izzadin Kassim has been responsible for carrying
out a number of suicide bombings on Israeli buses, in markets and
other public places.
</P>
<P>
The latest Hamas suicide attacks were the July 30 bombings of
Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda vegetable market and the September 4
bombings of Jerusalem's Ben Yehuda pedestrian mall last year,
which killed 25 people and wounded hundreds of others.
</P>
<P>
Since the release of its spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin
by Israel last October in a prisoners exchange deal, Hamas has so
far not launched any new terror attack against Israel.
</P>
<P>
In another development, over 200 Palestinian youths held a
demonstration in the West Bank city of Bethlehem Tuesday in
support of Iraq. But no clashes occurred after a large number of
Palestinian police formed a line to separate the protesters from
Israeli soldiers guarding the Jewish holy site Rachel's Tomb at
the entrance to the city.

<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Although it was around noon,
the sky was growing dark as an immense veil of sand was drawn
across most of northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region
today.
</P>
<P>
The lights of government offices, schools, and businesses were
all on in the daytime in the regional capital of Yinchuan, and out
on the street, visibility was below 500 meters, and the only color
to be seen was the yellow of automobiles' slowly moving lights.
</P>
<P>
The sandstorm swept parts of the Helan Mountain Range, and
traffic accidents were reported on the Yinchuan-Xi'an Highway and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon was caused by warm moist weather activity over
the region, which has had dry weather since last autumn, local
meteorologists say. The dry weather resulted in a thick layer of
arid earth across the region. Temperatures in February have been
higher than normal, and the warm moist front from the south was
especially active last night.

NAGANO, Japan, February 17 (Xinhua)-- South Korea dominated the
short track speed skating races at the 18th Olympic Winter Games when

<HEADLINE> Somali Shilling Depreciates as Meat Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The value of the hard
currencies are strengthening while the Somali Shilling is
substantially losing its value in Mogadishu's main markets.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Dollar, the strongest in the exchange markets in the
capital, has gained more than 1,200 Shillings extra in its value
against the Somali Shilling in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Bakara, Mogadishu's main hard currency exchange market, sold
each Dollar Tuesday to Somali Shillings 7,520, jumping from its
value of 6,300 Shillings. The other commonly used currencies
like the Saudi Riyals and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Dirhams
are likewise following the footsteps of the US Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The business community in the capital explained the
devaluation of the Somali Shilling as to be related to the
recently imposed ban of the Somali meat export to the Arabian
Gulf countries including Saudi Arabia and the UAE following the
alleged existence of the Rift Valley Fever in Somalia which could
as well has affected some of Somalia's livestock.
</P>
<P>
According to Muhsin Mohamed Abdalle (Jangow), a store keeper
in Bakara market, the money dealers in Mogadishu would at this
time of the year normally increase the value of the Somali
Shilling as its demands would be raised by the large meat and
animal exports to Saudi Arabia on the occasion of the preparation
for the pilgrimage of the year.
</P>
<P>
However, with the ban on Somalia's meat, the hope for the
usual huge export of meat and livestock is diminishing thus badly
affecting the hard currency revenue for the country.
</P>
<P>
The impact of the Dollar income scarcity has also forced
businessmen to collect more Dollars in an exchange for their
Somali Shillings in an effort to reduce the value they would lose
if they kept the unstable Somali Shilling in their savings.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, all the imported food items are getting more
expensive as the Dollar is gaining strength, but local food
products remain stable and unaffected by the floating Shillings.
</P>
<P>
Another important factor causing the devaluation of the Somali
Shilling is the lack of immediate political solution for
Somalia's multi-politicized societies as earlier expected by many
Somalis.
</P>
<P>
Many people also see that the opening of Mogadishu's air and
seaports would contribute to the building up of the staggering
economy of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the Cairo peace deal in late December last
year had positively affected the value of the Somali Shilling
which went into its strongest position against the U.S. Dollar
since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Now, the delay to the formation of a joint administration for
the capital and the postponement of the National Reconciliation
Conference to another 45 days are not working on the benefits of
Somalia's super decentralized economy and the people in general.

BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu

Meanwhile, the Chinese government is fully capable of
maintaining sustained and steady growth of its national economy,
Zhu told Leon Brittan, vice-president of the European Commission,

Speaking of Sino-EU ties, Zhu said that China has always valued
the development of stable, long-term, mutually beneficial and
cooperative ties with EU and its member states.
</P>

Recent years have witnessed the sound development of
Sino-EU relations featuring frequent high-level contacts, steady

COLOMBO, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's number one foreign
exchange earner, the textile and garment industry, has made an

</P>
<P>
China has nearly 100,000 grade-one cultural relics and 750

part of the bureau's effort to make Chinese cultural relics more
available, and increasing people's awareness of the need to
protect cultural relics has become one of the bureau's major tasks
for the near future, according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
In another effort, the bureau cooperated with China Central
Television in a series on Chinese civilization and with Chinese
Education Television on a series "In Museums".

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 17 (Xinhua) -- A gold prospector
announced Tuesday that it had struck gold at a project in
Peninsular Malaysia's central state of Pahang.
</P>
<P>
TRA Mining (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd said in a statement that assays
from drilling samples obtained at the Selinsing Project near Kg
Sungai Koyan in Lipis, Pahang, in November and December 1997,
revealed "impressive results of gold from a depth of only 27
meters below surface."
</P>
<P>
TRA executive director Peter Carter said in the statement that
a feasibility study received by TRA Mining's parent company had
shown that an open pit mining project at a depth of about 100
meters was possible.
</P>
<P>
The open pit was expected to have an initial life of five years
and produce about 38,000 ounces per annum for an average cash cost
of 165 U.S. dollars per ounce, he said.
</P>
<P>
Carter said financing options were being studied to allow a
final feasibility study to be completed by June 1998.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible that development of the mine could start in
late 1998," he added.

SHANGHAI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Sources close to the Shanghai
Municipal Government revealed that the city is scheduled to adopt
a series of measures to enhance its re-employment project.
</P>
<P>
More than 300,000 laid-off workers in Shanghai found new jobs
in 1997, which was attributed to the painstaking efforts of the
city's labor departments, trade unions and employment agencies.
</P>
<P>
However, 200,000 laid-off workers are awaiting for
re-employment.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai officials encourage the development of various types
of industries, especially labor-intensive ones, in a move to
create more job opportunities and to enlarge channels for the
city's laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
Concerned departments have called on laid-off workers to take
advantage of the labor market and job agencies to look for new job
opportunities, and have demanded the city's job agencies to share
information and resources.
</P>
<P>
The departments have also set up a special foundation, which
will offer training courses to laid-off workers in an effort to
adapt them to the requirements of their new posts.

MANILA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Bankers Association of the
Philippines Tuesday advised depositors not to engage in panic
withdrawals in light of a local bank's temporary holiday.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by the association's president, Deogracias
Vistan, amid reports that more and more depositors have become
itchy on whether to withdraw their deposits or not in anticipation
that some banks are on the verge of ceasing their operations as a
result of the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The troubled bank, Orient Bank, which suffered a liquidity
crisis due to property loans costing millions of pesos, was forced
by the central bank to declare a bank holiday on Saturday to let
the latter assume all of its bad loans.
</P>
<P>
Vistan assured the public that the experience of Orient Bank
will not be emulated as the central bank is willing to help
sagging banks.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has already discussed measures that would lead
to infusion of more capital to the beleaguered bank through a
buyout and two banks are on standby to rescue Orient Bank from
further collapse.

<HEADLINE> Jakarta's Turmoil May Worsen Seoul's Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's political and
economic turmoil may worsen South Korea's financial crisis, the
Federation of Korean Industries (FKI) said Tuesday in a report.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's loans worth five billion U.S. dollars to Indonesia
are expected to face insolvency as the latter's economic woes
won't improve in the first half of this year, the federation said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, even if foreign creditors agree to reschedule
debts owed by South Korean companies now in a virtual state of
moratorium, it would take over a year to negotiate on the terms.
</P>
<P>
These would ruin South Korean financial institutions and
accelerate corporate bankruptcies, the FKI said.
</P>
<P>
Scared by Indonesia's prolonged crisis, foreign banks may
withhold their loans and in turn lead to a new foreign currency
meltdown in South Korea, which is yet to come out from the crisis
triggered by corporate failures and bad loans of financial
institutions since late 1997.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's financial institutions have so far invested or
loaned 15.5 billion dollars to Southeast Asian countries. Of the
total, 9.3 billion dollars went to Indonesia and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
If the loans go insolvent, it means that South Korean creditors
will add more to their liabilities, further dampening foreign
financiers' faith in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the FKI urged South Korean businesses to be prepared
for possible repayment demands by foreign creditor banks while
making utmost efforts to minimize their damage.

On Monday, she held discussions with Rwandan government

SINGAPORE, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Share prices closed mostly
higher on the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times
Industrials Index (STII) increased by 15.35 points to finish at

dollars). Advances overwhelmed declines by 274 to 94 while 243
other counters remained unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Ruins of 2,200-Year-Old Great Wall Found in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Ruins of a section of the Great
Wall more than 2,200 years old have been found in the Yinshan
Mountains in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The section of the Great Wall, 5-to-6 meters high-by-3 meters
wide, winds through the mountains from east to west for more than
200 kilometers. It was built in the Qin Dynasty (221-206 B.C.)
with huge black stones found locally, according to archeologists.
</P>
<P>
Small beacon towers are located every kilometer, with large
beacon towers every five kilometers. Archeologists said the
section was well-protected for it was in a sparsely populated area.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists said this is another major discovery after Luo
Zhewen, a leading archaeologist, found a section of the Qin
Dynasty Great Wall in Guyang County in Baotou City in the
autonomous region more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
According to historical documents, Qinshihuang, who founded
China's first dynasty in 221 B.C., had the Great Wall built as a
defense against attack by Xiongnu, an ancient nationality in north
China.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists said the newly found section and the Guyang
portion of the wall were built by Meng Tian, a senior general of
the Qin Dynasty. The vast project was built with immeasurable
manpower and material resources.
</P>
<P>
On the site of the Great Wall, many relics have been
discovered, which suggests that the section was still in use
during the Western Han Dynasty (206-24 B.C.). The war between the
Western Han Dynasty and Xiongnu nationality ended in 33 B.C., and
troops stationed in the Yinshan mountains withdrew, abandoning the
section of the Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
China's Great Wall was built in incomplete sections over an
area spanning 5,000 kilometers. Parts have been restored, but
large portions lie in ruins. The Great Wall has become one of
China's main tourist attractions.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Slightly Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar was
little changed Tuesday as those hoping a much-awaited Australian
central bank report would signal an easing in monetary policy were
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) said monetary policy remains
conducive to domestic expansion and did not emphasize any concern
about the economic crisis in Asia, reducing speculation that the
central bank was considering lowering the overnight cash rate.
</P>
<P>
The local currency finished the day in Sydney at 66.75 US cents
from 66.55 US cents.
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing bullish in the (RBA) report, the market's
taken it up because there was one big buyer out there today and it
just became pass the parcel," said Chase Manhattan senior dealer
Andrew McGill.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the interbank market was caught short of
Australian dollars when a U.S. investment house bought
approximately 166 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 83.90 yen from 83.97 Monday,
and at 1.2114 marks from 1.2122.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Schools to Build Latrines on Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Primary schools in Uganda can
use Universal Primary Education (UPE) funds to build latrines if
they have no other money, a high ranking official has said.
</P>
<P>
Francie Babu, the state minister for education, told a
workshop on cholera prevention in Bulange in central Uganda
Monday that "if the schools does not have enough toilet
facilities and the only fund available is UPE money, you can use
it and give us a report."
</P>
<P>
Lack of toilets has led to closure of many schools in the
country. In western Kasese district alone, 129 primary and
secondary schools have been closed due to lack of toilets.
</P>
<P>
In view of widespread cholera epidemic, Health Minister
Crispus Kiyonga instructed earlier to have a joint check by
medical and education authorities on hygienic conditions in
schools.
</P>
<P>
The instruction empowered medical officers in districts to
close a school for lack of hygienic facilities such as running
water and latrine.
</P>
<P>
"Cholera is an emergency and we need to act quickly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cholera hit 26 of total 45 districts in the country in the
last three months beginning from late last November. There were
55,000 cholera cases in Kampala alone with 55 deaths.

<HEADLINE> Setback in S. African-EU Free Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The marathon talks
between South Africa and the European Union (EU) for a free trade
pact suffered a setback Monday when South African negotiators
threatened to pull out if the EU's offer were not improved.
</P>
<P>
The South African side was disappointed at the EU proposal
presented last month, local media said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The offer excluded 45.6 percent of South Africa's agricultural
exports from a free trade agreement and rejected South Africa's
proposal of phasing out its tariffs at a slower pace.
</P>
<P>
"Should we fail (to reach an agreement), the consequences for
South Africa would be no worse than we have at present," Elias
Links, South Africa's ambassador to the EU, told a joint sitting
of three parliament committees.
</P>
<P>
He said any agreement would have to be favorable to South
Africa, and that its negotiators would not simply sign offer on
the premise that "it was the best they could do."
</P>
<P>
The two sides, which have engaged in talks for more than 30
months, are trying to reach a final accord by June this year.

<HEADLINE> Launch of Euro to Provide Chances for Asia, HK: German Deputy FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The introduction of the
European single currency, the euro, means an additional
opportunity for Asia, particularly for Hong Kong, German Deputy
Foreign Minister Werner Hoyer said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The euro offers Europe and Asia the historic chance to create
together a new era of cooperation in the global economy, said
Hoyer, who arrived in Hong Kong Monday morning for a two-day
visit.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a luncheon organized by the Asia Society Hong Kong
Center, Hoyer said the euro will make Europe a global player of
stability and a strong partner for Asia and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps the European Union's most important contribution to
containing the Asian crisis and preventing future currency crises
is the introduction of the euro on January 1, 1999," he said.
</P>
<P>
The euro will further accelerate the modernization of the
European economy, create the second largest pensions market after
the United States, and have an efficient financial and stock
exchange center in Frankfurt, the seat of the future European
Central Bank, Hoyer said.
</P>
<P>
For companies in Hong Kong and Asia, the euro will make
investment in one of the major growth regions of the future easier
and cheaper, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Once all European Union countries have adopted the euro, you
will no longer have to deal with 14 different national currencies
as you have done up until now, but with just one common currency,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
For Hong Kong as a financial center, it is of particular
interest that in a European finance market with only one currency,
making portfolio decisions will be easier, both for institutional
and grassroots investors, since these can focus on the debtor's
creditworthiness and no longer need to take into consideration
exchange rate risks in the country concerned, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has already made a vital contribution to overcoming
the crisis and has proved its role as a stable financial center
through its far-sighted and determined stability-oriented policy,
Hoyer said.
</P>
<P>
The smooth and orderly handover of Hong Kong to China according
 to the principle of "one country, two systems," the Hong Kong
Monetary Authority's decisive measures to defend the rate of
exchange, the sound budgetary policy and the Chinese authorities'
assurances that the Chinese currency's rate of exchange will be
maintained and the HK dollar defended are all of utmost importance
to the continued stability of Hong Kong's currency.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Yam, chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority, attended the luncheon. During his stay in Hong Kong,
Hoyer met with Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa and Yam.

<P>
NAIROBI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen Zimbabwean companies
and 10 Kenyan companies feature among the top 40 companies in
sub-Saharan Africa excluding South Africa, according to the FT
500 Survey on corporate rankings in the world.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the remaining 15 of the top 40 are located
in Southern Africa Development Community with four in Mauritius,
three in Namibia and one each in Botswana and Malawi.
</P>
<P>
The remaining six are in west Africa with four in Nigeria and
two in Ghana, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Delta Corporation, Meikles Africa and Barclays Bank
Zimbabwe are ranked first, third and fourth of the top 40 with a
market capitalization of 1,109 million, 347 million and 341
million U.S. Dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's Bamburi Cement and Barclays Bank Kenya are ranked
eighth and ninth with a market capitalization of 245 million and
222 million Dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
Stock market capitalization is used to measure company size in
sub-Saharan Africa, but it is difficult to do so as there are few
active stock exchanges in the region.
</P>
<P>
The list is hardly representative of Africa's economic
strengths because three quarters of the region's exports are
commodities dominated by oil, metals, coffee and cocoa, the
survey said.
</P>
<P>
The FT 500 Survey which started in the early 1980s with the
aim of listing the top 500 companies in western Europe has
expanded to include corporate rankings covering every significant
region of the world.

HONG KONG, February 17 (Xinhua) -- When urban people working
nine-to-five for their bread visit the World Boys and Girls Art
Exhibition here in Hong Kong, they will definitely recall the
laughter and tears, dreams and hopes they had when they were at
the age of innocence.
</P>
<P>
What make the exposition different from any other art displays

the adult world.
</P>
<P>
A total of 425 paintings selected from 100,000 entries by
children aged between three to 15 in 161 countries and regions,
including Hong Kong and China's mainland, will be on display for

</P>
<P>
The exhibition also serves as a medium for children around the
world to learn about one another through their paintings.
</P>

community to write off debt owed by its members, South Africa's
Business Day newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"There is no good reason why the debt of these states should
not be written off," SADC Executive Secretary Kaire Mbuende was
quoted as saying at the weekend at a debate on debt crisis in
Sweden.
</P>
<P>
"After all, the official creditors are developed countries'
governments and multilateral finance institutions owned by the
very same governments. It is not as if these monies are owed to
private banks."
</P>
<P>
Mbuende said the SADC was formulating a policy on the debt
crisis after realizing that the current approach of addressing
the issue on individual state basis was not working.
</P>
<P>
The debt burden was affecting the SADC's program of regional
integration, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mbuende said repeated debt rescheduling had failed to help
developing countries meet their debt-servicing obligations fully
and on time.
</P>
<P>
"This pushes them even deeper into debt and graduates (them)
into heavily indebted poor countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Data from the SADC finance and investment unit in Pretoria,
South Africa, show that in 1996 Mozambique's external debt was
427.5 percent of its GDP; Tanzania's was 241 percent; Zambia
194.6 percent; Angola 171 percent and Malawi about 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
An SADC official at the body's headquarters in Botswana said
Monday that talks on SADC foreign debt policy were at an early
stage. A discussion paper was expected before a heads-of-state
summit meeting in September.
</P>
<P>
The official said the SADC's partners, chiefly the European
Union and the United States, would be asked to support
development as the debt problem tended to divert funds from
development.
</P>
<P>
The SADC, established in 1992, groups 14 sub-Sahara countries
including South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Elephant with Broken Tusk Recuperating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 17 (Xinhua) -- An elephant weighing three
tons, which broke its own tusk a week ago, is recovering under the
treatment of veterinarians at Shenyang Zoo in northeast China's
Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The elephant, "A Ming," broke off 110 centimeters (cm) of its
tusk on Feb. 10, with 10 cm of dental pulp exposed. The elephant
lost 10,000 milliliters of blood.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Shenyang Zoo said the elephant continued to
eat after breaking its tusk. It pulled off five cm of dental pulp
with its own trunk, which reportedly is the elephant's instinct
for self-protection.
</P>
<P>
The elephant previously had broken its tusks twice.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that artificially fed elephants usually break
their tusks if they are too long.

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Old US Arms Ban Blocks Sale to S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 17 (Xinhua) -- As the he U.S. ban on
arms deals with the apartheid regime is still in place,
Washington has refused to approve the sale of jet fighters to
South Africa until the ban is lifted.
</P>
<P>
The ban affects the proposed sale to South Africa of the
Swedish- built Gripen jet fighters because the plane includes
large American content, local newspaper The Star reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The prohibition stems from alleged illegal arms smuggling
involving local companies during the 20-year United Nations ban
on arms deals with the former apartheid regime.
</P>
<P>
The ban was lifted by other United Nations members in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Puso Tladi, spokesman for the South African Defense Minister
Joe Modise, said Monday that there appeared to be "a
misunderstanding" about the issues involved.
</P>
<P>
South African army sources, however, said they expected "a
huge row" involving the two countries and Sweden and Britain,
which market the plane through British Aerospace on behalf of the
manufacturers, Saab Aerospace.
</P>
<P>
Britain and Sweden based their joint effort to win a large
slice of South Africa's national procurements package -- valued
at about 2.6 billion U.S. Dollars in total -- on winning the
order for 36 Gripens.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Defends Tehran Mayor against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Former Iranian President
Hashemi Rafsanjani has openly defended Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein
Karabaschi against accusation of being involved in embezzlement,
local newspaper Iran Daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"All those who have honestly served the nation should not be
subjected to insult and false accusations," Rafsanjani, also
Chairman of Iran's State Expediency Council, told a group of
lawmakers Monday.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani made the remarks after Karabaschi was summoned by a
court for explanation and some reports said that he has confessed
his crimes in a letter to the court.
</P>
<P>
The former president said that "we should not allow difference
of style and factionalism to damage the prestige and integrity of
capable and competent people and such an approach would be very
dangerous."
</P>
<P>
He cautioned the authorities and those responsible "to abstain
from such harmful practice," saying that "in an Islamic society a
competent person should not feel depressed, dejected or sidelined
due to character assassination, factionalism and differences
of opinion."
</P>
<P>
The hardline daily Resalat recently reported that Karabaschi
sent a letter to a court confessing that he was responsible for
the crimes made by his former financial deputy who has been
imprisoned for embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
However, many political figures including former Majlis Speaker
Mehdi Karubi openly defended Karabaschi by praising him for the
"glorious achievements" for Tehran city during the past eight
years.
</P>
<P>
Under Rafsanjani's support, Karbaschi made a dauntless reform
and beautified the Iranian capital with a package of
reconstruction plans.
</P>
<P>
The left-wing factions have stated that the Karabaschi case
was politically motivated and was aimed at weakening the
government of President Mohammad Khatami, because Karabaschi
supported Khatami during the presidential elections last year.

<P>
COLOMBO, February 17 (Xinhua) -- At least seven soldiers were
killed and four others wounded by Tamil rebels in Chavakachcheri,
Jaffna Peninsula, Monday, military spokesman Ink Dewage said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The rebel attack took place when troops on a patrol mission
encountered the rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) during the day.
</P>
<P>
Dewage said the troops retaliated upon the rebels with small
arms and repulsed them after more government troops rushed in to
help.
</P>
<P>
The troops later found the body of one dead rebel and a
rocket-propelled grenade launcher.
</P>
<P>
Sporadic fighting also occurred in various places in the north
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the capital city of Colombo, additional security
personnel have been positioned on the streets.
</P>
<P>
At some key checkpoints, troops are equipped with automatic
machine guns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, which have
seldom been used before.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting for an independent Tamil state in
the north and east of the country since 1983.

<TEXT>
<P>
Chi went on to say China unswervingly follows the road of
building a slim but strong armed forces with Chinese
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
"We are of the view that a reasonable and streamlined scale of
armed forces helps improve the environment of international arms
control and disarmament, benefits the establishment of an
atmosphere of mutual trust among countries and is all the more
beneficial for us to focus on economic development."
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1980s, China took the initiative to cut its armed
forces by 1 million to 3 million, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Chi described the cut as an unique action in today's world in
terms of its scope and margin, which presented a striking contrast
to the arms race between the two military blocs in the world at
that time, namely the NATO led by the United States and the Warsaw
Pact headed by the then Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
In September 1997, Chinese President Jiang Zemin declared that
China would downsize its armed forces by another half million in
the following three years.
</P>
<P>
Chi said the move has fully demonstrated China's determination
to adhere to the road of building a slim but strong armed forces
with Chinese characteristics and is China's another important
contribution to the maintenance of world peace as well.
</P>
<P>
Another important content of China's defense policy is to
commit itself to the maintenance of world peace and the promotion
of human progress, the defense minister said.
</P>
<P>
"China does not seek hegemony or foreign expansion. China does
not establish military alliance with any other country in the
world, nor does it station its troops or set up military bases on
foreign soil," he said.
</P>
<P>
"China is now the only nuclear power pledging not to be the
first to use nuclear weapon under whatever circumstances and
unconditionally not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapon
against non-nuclear weapon countries or regions."
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, China attaches great importance to the security
environment in the region and has all along dedicated itself to
promoting dialogue and cooperation with all countries in the
region," Chi said.
</P>
<P>
China has established consultation mechanisms on arms control,
non-proliferation, disarmament or security issues with Australia,
the United States, Japan, Canada and Russia, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
China has participated in the process of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum and has made its due
contributions to its sound development.
</P>
<P>
China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have
signed the Agreement on Confidence Building in the Military Field
in Border Areas and the Agreement on Mutual Reduction of Military
Forces in Border Areas, he pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Minister Calls for New Security Concept </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Defense
Minister Chi Haotian said here Tuesday that China believes a new
security concept should be set so as to win a lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
In an address to about 100 students of the Australian College
of Defense and Strategic Studies, Chi, the first Chinese defense
minister to visit Australia, said China maintains that the new
security concept and means should include the following aspects:
</P>
<P>
-- To establish nation-to-nation relations on the basis of the
Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, namely, mutual respect
for territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual non-aggression,
non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and
mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence.
</P>
<P>
This is the political foundation and precondition for global
and regional security. In this regard, the establishment of
healthy and stable relations among big powers is critical for
peace and security in the region and the world.
</P>
<P>
-- All countries should strengthen mutually beneficial
cooperation in the economic field, open to each other, eliminate
the unequal phenomenon and discriminative policy in economic
exchanges and trade, gradually narrow the gap between countries in
terms of their level of development, and seek common prosperity.
This is the economic foundation for global and regional security.
</P>
<P>
-- All countries should enhance mutual understanding and trust
through dialogue and cooperation, pledge to resolve differences
and conflicts among nations through peaceful means. This is the
practical ways of ensuring peace and security. Security is
interactive. The purpose of security dialogue is to promote trust
instead of creating confrontation, let alone direct at any third
country or harm the security interests of other countries.
</P>
<P>
Chi said that under the new circumstances, the practice of
expanding military bloc and strengthening military alliance brings
no good to security, which should depend on mutual trust and
common interests.
</P>
<P>
"It has been proven that the security system in the Cold War
period, which was characterized by making military alliance as its
foundation and the enhancement of military armament as its means,
could not help create peace," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He concluded that the right way to safeguard one's own and
regional security in the post-Cold War era is to enhance trust
through dialogue, seek security through cooperation, respect each
other's sovereignty, resolve disputes through peaceful means and
seek common development.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Defense Minister on China's Defense Policy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Defense
Minister Chi Haotian said here Tuesday that China pursues a
national defense policy which is defensive in nature and China's
defense construction neither is directed against nor poses a
threat to any other country.
</P>
<P>
In an address to about 100 students of the Australian College
of Defense and Strategic Studies, Chi said the defense policy was
determined by China's social system and national security
interests.
</P>
<P>
"The basic goals of China's defense policy are to consolidate
national defense, resist foreign aggression, defend the nation's
sovereignty over its territorial land, sea and airspace as well as
its maritime rights and interests and safeguard national unity and
security," he said.
</P>
<P>
He quoted China's law on national defense as saying China
pursues a strategy of active defense and the principle of seeking
self-defense by relying on the people,
</P>
<P>
He explained that the Chinese armed forces depend on the people
and strategically follow the principle of self-defense and gaining
initiative by striking only after the enemy has struck.
</P>
<P>
"In accordance with this strategy, the People's Liberation Army
(Chinese armed forces) has always maintained a sound level of
combat readiness in the peaceful environment so as to contain the
outbreak of war."
</P>
<P>
"Once the national sovereignty and territorial integrity are
impaired and the country is under foreign aggression, we will
carry out resolute self-defense."
</P>
<P>
Chi stressed that China's long-term basic policy is to make the
construction of national defense subordinate to and serve the
overall interests of the national economic development.
</P>
<P>
Despite the country's great progress in economic development in
the past two decades, "China has remained a developing country
with relatively weak economic strength compared with the developed
countries in the world."
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 50 million plus people who still live
under the poverty line in China, he noted. "It will take decades
of hard and unremitting efforts before China becomes a moderately
developed country."
</P>
<P>
He noted that China has strictly controlled its defense
expenditure over the years.
</P>
<P>
China's defense budget for 1997 was 80.5 billion yuan,
equivalent to 9.7 billion U.S. dollars, compared with 260 billion
dollars for the United States and 40.8 billion dollars for Japan
in the same year, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
To a big country like China, its defense budget is very small,
which can only be enough to meet the lowest level of its defense
requirement, he said.

<P>
Chi pledged that in the future, China will not substantially
increase its defense budget so long as there is no serious threat
to its national sovereignty and security.

<P>
Chi went on to say China unswervingly follows the road of
building a slim but strong armed forces with Chinese
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
"We are of the view that a reasonable and streamlined scale of
armed forces helps improve the environment of international arms
control and disarmament, benefits the establishment of an
atmosphere of mutual trust among countries and is all the more
beneficial for us to focus on economic development."
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1980s, China took the initiative to cut its armed
forces by 1 million to 3 million, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Chi described the cut as an unique action in today's world in
terms of its scope and margin, which presented a striking contrast
to the arms race between the two military blocs in the world at
that time, namely the NATO led by the United States and the Warsaw
Pact headed by the then Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
In September 1997, Chinese President Jiang Zemin declared that
China would downsize its armed forces by another half million in
the following three years.
</P>
<P>
Chi said the move has fully demonstrated China's determination
to adhere to the road of building a slim but strong armed forces
with Chinese characteristics and is China's another important
contribution to the maintenance of world peace as well.
</P>
<P>
Another important content of China's defense policy is to
commit itself to the maintenance of world peace and the promotion
of human progress, the defense minister said.
</P>
<P>
"China does not seek hegemony or foreign expansion. China does
not establish military alliance with any other country in the
world, nor does it station its troops or set up military bases on
foreign soil," he said.
</P>
<P>
"China is now the only nuclear power pledging not to be the
first to use nuclear weapon under whatever circumstances and
unconditionally not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapon
against non-nuclear weapon countries or regions."
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, China attaches great importance to the security
environment in the region and has all along dedicated itself to
promoting dialogue and cooperation with all countries in the
region," Chi said.
</P>
<P>
China has established consultation mechanisms on arms control,
non-proliferation, disarmament or security issues with Australia,
the United States, Japan, Canada and Russia, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
China has participated in the process of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum and has made its due
contributions to its sound development.
</P>
<P>
China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have
signed the Agreement on Confidence Building in the Military Field
in Border Areas and the Agreement on Mutual Reduction of Military
Forces in Border Areas, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Chi is visiting Australia at the invitation of his Australian
counterpart, Ian McLachlan.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Jordan in Quiet Talks on Restoring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Israel is conducting quiet
talks with Jordan in order to restore bilateral security
cooperation damaged by Israel's botched attempt to murder Hamas
leader Khaled Mashaal in Amman last September.
</P>
<P>
The English daily The Jerusalem Post disclosed in a front-page
story that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had sent to
King Hussein of Jordan a copy of the conclusions of the
investigation into the Mashaal affair, along with a reassuring
message promising not to repeat such operation in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The report, presented to Netanyahu Monday by the Ciechanover
Committee in charge of the probe, severely criticized Danny Yatom,
head of the secret service Mossad, for many faults in the planning
and operation of the assassination attempt against Mashaal.
</P>
<P>
The failed attempt due to the capture of two Mossad agents by
Jordanian police created an international furor and damaged the
warm relationship between Israel and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein later ordered the suspension of the
Israeli-Jordanian security cooperation, which is very important
for Israel to gather intelligence on its enemy countries, such as
Iraq, Syria and Iran.
</P>
<P>
In his message, Netanyahu reportedly explained to King Hussein
the necessity of carrying out the assassination operation against
Mashaal, who was blamed for masterminding the Hamas suicide
bombing campaign against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials reportedly were angered that the Israeli
report did not criticize the carrying out of the operation on
Jordanian soil.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu promised that Yatom would leave his post
within a few months, a move that would placate Jordan's anger
about the Mashaal affair.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh neither confirmed nor
denied the delivery of the message to King Hussein from
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu, in his comments after receiving the report, said
Monday that both Israel and Jordan have a common interest in
maintaining peace and security relations.

claimed his second gold medal at the 18th Olympic Winter Games when he
won the men's 10,000m speed skating event with a world record time
here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Romme, who won the men's 5,000m with a record time

<HEADLINE> Chinese Defense Minister on China's Defense Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Defense
Minister Chi Haotian said here Tuesday that China pursues a
national defense policy which is defensive in nature and China's
defense construction neither is directed against nor poses a
threat to any other country.
</P>
<P>
In an address to about 100 students of the Australian College
of Defense and Strategic Studies, Chi said the defense policy was
determined by China's social system and national security
interests.
</P>
<P>
"The basic goals of China's defense policy are to consolidate
national defense, resist foreign aggression, defend the nation's
sovereignty over its territorial land, sea and airspace as well as
its maritime rights and interests and safeguard national unity and
security," he said.
</P>
<P>
He quoted China's law on national defense as saying China
pursues a strategy of active defense and the principle of seeking
self-defense by relying on the people,
</P>
<P>
He explained that the Chinese armed forces depend on the people
and strategically follow the principle of self-defense and gaining
initiative by striking only after the enemy has struck.
</P>
<P>
"In accordance with this strategy, the People's Liberation Army
(Chinese armed forces) has always maintained a sound level of
combat readiness in the peaceful environment so as to contain the
outbreak of war."
</P>
<P>
"Once the national sovereignty and territorial integrity are
impaired and the country is under foreign aggression, we will
carry out resolute self-defense."
</P>
<P>
Chi stressed that China's long-term basic policy is to make the
construction of national defense subordinate to and serve the
overall interests of the national economic development.
</P>
<P>
Despite the country's great progress in economic development in
the past two decades, "China has remained a developing country
with relatively weak economic strength compared with the developed
countries in the world."
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 50 million plus people who still live
under the poverty line in China, he noted. "It will take decades
of hard and unremitting efforts before China becomes a moderately
developed country."
</P>
<P>
He noted that China has strictly controlled its defense
expenditure over the years.
</P>
<P>
China's defense budget for 1997 was 80.5 billion yuan,
equivalent to 9.7 billion U.S. dollars, compared with 260 billion
dollars for the United States and 40.8 billion dollars for Japan
in the same year, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
To a big country like China, its defense budget is very small,
which can only be enough to meet the lowest level of its defense
requirement, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chi pledged that in the future, China will not substantially
increase its defense budget so long as there is no serious threat
to its national sovereignty and security.

LUSAKA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- ZYNEX Telekom Limited, a
privately owned telecommunication company, has been established in
customers, weekly Financial Mail published Tuesday reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the company's executive director Swatulani
Munthali as saying in an interview that the founding directors
have taken the advantage of the liberalization process in Zambia
that opened up the telecommunication industry to other private
operators.
</P>
<P>
ZYNEX applied for a license to start operating pay phones in
1996 and obtained it the same year from the country's
Communications Authority.
</P>
<P>
However, it has taken a long time for them to start operating
due to some technological and financial reasons, explained the
executive director.
</P>
<P>
ZYNEX will use the technology provided by a South African
company which has started equipment installation for the
newly-established company in Zambia since last November,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Zynex, whose pay phonesd use chip cards sold in denominations of
10, 50 and 200 units, is currently testing the pay phonesd in the
capital while discussions are going on with some prospective
partners to be running the services on franchise basis.
</P>
<P>
An agreement has also been signed by ZYNEX with the
state-owned Zambia Telecommunication Company (ZAMTEL) where the
private company is getting the lines.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Rebukes Iraq's Warning of Aiding US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait strongly rebuked
Baghdad Monday night for warning it against aiding U.S. in
launching a possible military strike against Iraq and assured its
people of sound security situation.
</P>
<P>
"There have been systematically threats all through from the
Iraqi regime, this is something we are used to," Kuwaiti
Information Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah said in response
to the warning issued Monday evening by Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf warned Kuwait against committing a "deadly mistake"
by letting the U.S. use its soil to attack Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"This is neither a threat nor an appeal. Whoever opens his
territories for the Americans to spill innocent Iraqi women's and
children's blood would bear the detrimental consequences of his
crime," the Iraqi foreign minister said in Beirut after talks
with his Lebanese counterpart Farez Boueiz.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Saud said "the Iraqi threats prove the hostile
intentions of the Iraqi regime toward Kuwait...they must realize
we have a responsibility in protecting the country with our
coalition partners and allies."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has been a close U.S. ally in the Gulf region since the
Gulf War in 1991 when U.S.-led coalition forces helped drive away
the Iraqi occupying troops from the country.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and the U.S. entered into a defense treaty after the
Gulf War. The U.S. has maintained a military base in the Gulf
state and has deployed in Kuwait 1,500 troops and six F-117A
stealth fighter bombers since last November.
</P>
<P>
Six more stealth planes and 3,000 marine troops are still to
come to join the U.S. forces here in preparation for a possible
military strike against Iraq if diplomatic efforts failed to solve
the current Iraq-U.N. standoff over arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sheikh Saud assured the Kuwaiti people that the
security situation in Kuwait is sound and there is no reason for
worry.
</P>
<P>
He said Kuwait is "concerned about the Iraqi people...we have
to differentiate between the Iraqi people and the Iraqi regime,
that's very important for us."
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti minister said that Kuwait's hope for a diplomatic
solution to the standoff springs from Kuwait's concern for the
Iraqi people because in any military action it is possible that
civilians become victims.

<HEADLINE> China's Top Jurist Meets Hong Kong Chief Justice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Ren Jianxin, president of the
Supreme People's Court, today called for strengthening links
between courts in inland areas and the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
They should also expand exchanges, cooperate in an active way
and offer mutual assistance for a better performance of the Hong
Kong judicial work through strictly abiding by the HKSAR Basic
Law, Ren said.
</P>
<P>
Ren made the remarks at a meeting with Andrew Li Rwok-nang,
chief justice of the Court of Final Appeal of HKSAR in the Great
Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
Ren extended a warm welcome to Andrew Li on his first visit to
Beijing as the chief justice. The visit marks the first official
exchange between courts of the inland area and HKSAR since its
establishment on July 1, Ren said.
</P>
<P>
The president described the establishment of the HKSAR Court of
Final Appeal as an important manifestation of the implementation
of the "One Country, Two Systems" policy in judicial affairs and
an important judicial guarantee of the policy of Hong Kong
governed by Hong Kong people and the high degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Ren also praised the Court of Final Appeal presided over by
Chief Justice Andrew Li for its effective performance. The court
has made marked achievements and contributions to the HKSAR's
prosperity and stability, Ren said.
</P>
<P>
Ren suggested that courts between HKSAR and inland areas
strengthen links, broaden exchanges, cooperate with one another
and offer mutual assistance.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Li said he was pleased to have the chance to meet
President Ren and to know something about the judicial system in
inland areas. Only after the establishment of the HKSAR, can the
region enjoy the right of final appeal, Li said. At present, he
said, the courts in HKSAR are effectively performing their duties
and have begun to handle both civil and criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
The chief justice also said he hoped to forge closer links with
the inland courts, enhancing their mutual understanding and
developing cooperation.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- A Nigerian soldier of the west
African peace-keeping force known as ECOMOG has been named as the
head of an ad hoc administrative body to oversee affairs of
Sierra Leone after the fall of the military junta.
</P>
<P>
The ad hoc body will take care of the running of state
activities and ensure the maintenance of law and order, pending
the return of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, according to a report
reaching here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah has been in exile in neighboring Guinea since his
government was overthrown in a coup last May.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the need for maintenance of law and
order after the exit of the junta led by Johnny Paul Koroma was
necessitated by the acts of vandalism embarked upon by the forces
of Koroma who were said to have attacked six villages around
Freetown Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The defeated junta soldiers burned down 70 houses and killed
38 civilians during the attack which came four days after ECOMOG
took control of the capital Freetown and is the first by the
demoralized junta forces since their defeat, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The six villages were reportedly not within the areas of
ECOMOG forces at that time.
</P>
<P>
There were also similar incidents of junta attacks on
civilians in the hinterland.
</P>
<P>
Expatriate staff working for some international organizations
were also abducted by the fleeing army.
</P>
<P>
In Freetown, ECOMOG Commander Col. Maxwell Kobe said Monday
that his troops were ready to move out of the capital into the
provinces to pursue the remnants of the junta forces and their
allies.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG on the same day said it had brought the entire Freetown
Peninsula under firm control.

Olympic and world champion Kevin Jackson in 85 kg and Olympic
medalist Melvin Douglas in 97kg.
</P>
<P>
Head of the American Wrestling Federation Larry Sciacchetano
said upon arrival that despite the arrival of the team on early
hours of the day, the welcome accorded to the team was very
impressive.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Iranians on the Frakfurt-Tehran flight also
well received the American wrestlers.
</P>
<P>
Some Western reports said earlier that the American team would
have a mission of a "Wrestling Diplomacy," like the Chinese "Ping
Pang Diplomacy" in 1971, to improve Washington-Tehran relations.
</P>
<P>
However, both Iranian and American officials rejected the
reports, saying that the visit of the American wrestlers to Tehran
has no political objectives.
</P>
<P>
The four-day Takhti Cup Tournament, which was named after
Iran's famous wrestler Gholamreza Takhti, will start Tuesday with
Greco-Roman and free-style categories. Reports said wrestlers from
12 countries would join the matches.

<HEADLINE> "Titanic" Dominates U.S. Box Office for Ninth Weekend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Disaster epic "Titanic"
dominated the U.S. box office for the ninth weekend and earned
27.4 million dollars from Friday to Sunday.
</P>
<P>
On Valentine's Day, which fell on Saturday this year, the movie
posted its own highest single-day gross of 12 million dollars,
industry estimates showed.
</P>
<P>
It has taken in 370.8 million dollars after 59 days to become
the third-highest ticket seller in the U.S. film market, after
"Star Wars" (461 million dollars) and 1982's "E.T. -- The
Extraterrestrial" (399.8 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Its final total may well break the previous records by the end
of the month, the estimates said.
</P>
<P>
"Titanic," the epic account of a fateful love affair on the
doomed ocean-liner, has captured 14 Oscar nominations including
those for best picture, best actress and best director.
</P>
<P>
Among the latest viewers in Los Angeles was renowned Chinese
director Zhang Yimou, who has been here with a Chinese movie
delegation.
</P>
<P>
He said he didn't quite understand why Americans were so crazy
about the movie.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference last week, Zhang praised its trick shots
and the vivid scene of the liner sinking.
</P>
<P>
"But as a whole, the movie is not particularly appealing," he
said. "It's just so-so. I think 14 (Oscar) nominations are too
many for such an average movie."

<HEADLINE> Israeli Economic Growth Slows Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Israel's economic growth
slowed down to 1.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 1997, the
Central Bureau of Statistics said in a report published Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This compared to the growth of 1.9 percent in the third quarter
of 1997 and 1.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the English daily The Jerusalem Post,
which was published Tuesday, Avi Ben Bassat, Hebrew University
economist and a former senior official of Bank of Israel, said the
figures indicated a "severe slowdown." And he called for a change
in the fiscal and monetary policies.
</P>
<P>
He argued that the insistence of the central bank that
inflation must come down at all costs is too extreme and is even
leading to interest rates increasing, rather than decreasing.
</P>
<P>
In order to reduce the country's high budgetary deficit and
inflation, the Likud government has been imposing massive
budgetary cuts and belt-tighting financial policies.
</P>
<P>
These measures have reduced the inflation, but led to the
increase of unemployment and a continued slowdown in economic
growth from the average over 6 percent last decade to 4 percent
in 1996 and the estimated 2 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Bank of Israel announced a 0.5 percent cut in its
key lending rate, and the bank is likely to implement another cut
in early March. This is expected to stimulate the economic growth
and reduce the unemployment.

KATHMANDU, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Lower House of the
Nepalese Parliament Tuesday began to discuss a no-confidence
motion against the present coalition government led by Surya
Bahadur Thapa.
</P>
<P>
The discussions will continue on Wednesday and the voting is
scheduled for Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ruling partners -- the Nepali Congress, the National
Democratic Party (RPP) and the Nepal Sadbhavana Party -- have
issued whips directing their MPs to vote against the censure
motion tabled on February 6 by the main opposition Communist Party
of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML) and a breakaway
faction of the RPP.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML and the breakaway faction of the RPP have asked
their MPs to vote for the motion.
</P>
<P>
The lower house session was called by King Birendra on the
advice of the Supreme Court. The king turned down a recommendation
by Prime Minister Thapa that the parliament be dissolved for
mid-term polls.
</P>
<P>
Observers say it is hard to say whether the motion can pass in
the lower house as horse trading is still going on.

BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- China's textile and clothing
market should maintain steady growth this year, according to a
survey report released by the Ministry of Internal Trade.
</P>
<P>
The retail sales of clothing products will reach 360.8 billion
yuan in 1998, accounting for 11 percent of the country's total
sales of consumer goods, the report said.
</P>
<P>
As the country's textile industry is swept by a nationwide
reform in production systems and capital management, more and more
enterprises will shift their focus to the high-class coating
materials and garments.
</P>
<P>
An increased demand is expected for knitted underwear in rural
areas this year, but the market competition will become rougher as
a lot of big companies have expanded their production scale.
</P>
<P>
The domestic clothing market should register stable growth this
year, with the expanding class of white-collar workers becoming
the largest consumer of medium- and high-class garments.

<P>
MAPUTO, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank will provide a
total of loans of 480 million U.S. Dollars from 1998 to 2000 to
help Mozambique develop private businesses and human resources,
local paper "Noticias" reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by James Coates, newly appointed World Bank
representative based in Mozambique, here Monday. He said the
loans were decided in response to the rapid growth of
Mozambique's economy and the continuing expansion of
infrastructures in the country.
</P>
<P>
The loans were also aimed at supporting its agriculture,
education and industry, Coates noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Bank official, his agency approved a
loan of 36 million U.S. Dollars to Mozambique Sunday to assist
the country in improving water supply to its urban and rural
areas to prevent and curb the occurrences of cholera, which has
killed 544 Mozambicans since last August.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that during his term, he will continue to support
the privatization process, the investment in agriculture and the
building of the three corridors of Maputo, Beira and Nacala in
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the World Bank has provided loans of 200
million U.S. Dollars during the period from 1995 to 1997 to

<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The department of civil
affairs in the Chinese capital has started work on establishing
files on local low-income residents in a bid to standardize
services.
</P>
<P>
A survey is being carried out on families who receive the
bottom-line income provided by the government and all families
with per capita monthly average income between 190 and 210 yuan.
</P>
<P>
All the information on these families will be saved in

</P>
<P>
Beijing first introduced the bottom-line income system in 1996
and raised the monthly bottom-line income to 190 yuan per capita
in 1997 from the former 170 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the local government has passed a series of
preferential measures on grain and edible oil supply, medical
treatment and compulsory education.
</P>
<P>
So far Beijing has granted bottom-line income for more than
15,700 local residents with low income, and offered discount cards
for cereals and oils to more than 20,000 people.

DAR ES SALAAM, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of people have
been rendered homeless after Ruaha River in southern Tanzania's
Iringa Region burst banks due to heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
The river has expanded to a width of 250 meters and the water
is only two meters away from Iringa-Dar es Salaam highway, the
Daily Mail reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The rising level of water since last week has flooded at least
15 houses, forcing people to seek shelter in the highland.
</P>
<P>
Local officials are still assessing the damages of the floods
caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Devastating floods since last December have killed 87 people
and injured 118 others in Tanzania, President Mkapa said earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
The floods have also left 155,000 people homeless, 128,000
hectares of farmland barren, and fueled the outbreak of cholera.
</P>
<P>
The country needs as much as 110 million U.S. Dollars to
restore infrastructures and services damaged.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa has appealed for international assistance and

goal deficit to beat China 4-1, winning the bronze medal of the
women's ice hockey tournament at the 18th Olympic Winter Games here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
China's Yang Xiuqing outskated two Finnish defensive players to put
the firt puck in the net at 9:27.
</P>
<P>
After the interval, Finland sped up its pace and put three goals in

<P>
A slapshot by Johanna Ikonen at 27:08 and a shot on the fly from
Sanna Lankosaari at 30:15 moved Finland up with two goals over China.
</P>
<P>
In the final seconds, China pulled its goalie back to add man-power
on the ice, but the strategy was backfired with Hanna-Riikka Nieminen
put the fourth goal in the open net.
</P>
<P>
Chinese team coach Zhang Zhilan was surprised with the performance

<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Some 55,600 laid-off workers
found new jobs last year in Guangzhou, capital of south China's
Guangdong Province, helping to keep the city's unemployment rate
below 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the city faces a more difficult employment environment
as state-run enterprises, the traditional major employer in China,
requires an ever-dwindling workforce as a result of deepening
reform.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the gap between the overall quality of laid-off
workers and the requirements of employers is widening.
</P>
<P>
The concerned departments have begun a package of measures such
as favorable policies, financial assistance and the further
improvement of the re-employment service system to deal with the
situation.
</P>
<P>
According to a circular issued last year by city authorities,
enterprises which enroll 10 or more laid-off workers at one time
are entitled to rewards from the government.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the city's re-employment foundation
boasted of more than 80 million yuan, of which 14 million yuan had
been used to help in the training, employment and settlement of
27,000 laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
To date, the re-employment service system in Guangzhou has
comparatively matured and is capable of offering training classes,
financial assistance and re-employment opportunities to laid-off
workers.

<HEADLINE> Transporters Warned Against Overloading in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
issued a strict warning to transporters and haulage companies
against overloading of vehicles in a bid to prevent the country's
roads from further deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
Kipkalya Kones, Minister for Public Works and Housing, was
quoted by Daily Nation paper as saying in a statement Monday that
the government would not tolerate the continued damage on the
roads surface by overloading.
</P>
<P>
He noted that officers from his ministry and traffic police
had been instructed to strictly enforce traffic laws "with
immediate effect".
</P>
<P>
"Any person who contravenes the requirements of the Traffic
Act will be charged and his vehicle impounded until the extra
load is removed at the transporter's cost," the minister
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The minister's statement comes in the wake of the rapid
deteriorating of the road network in the east African country as
a result of the three-month-long heavy rains caused by the El
Nino phenomenon.

rehabilitation work reportedly asked the government Monday to
stop all vehicles weighing over 40 tons from using the
Nairobi-Mombasa highway to save the road from total collapse.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Transport Association Monday supported the idea of
barring trucks weighing over 40 tons from using the road, urging
the government to punish motorists who break the law and traffic
regulations.

SHENYANG, February 17 (Xinhua) -- An elephant weighing three
kilograms, which broke its own tusk a week ago, is recovering
under the treatment of veterinarians at Shenyang Zoo in northeast
China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The elephant, "A Ming," broke off 110 centimeters (cm) of its
tusk on Feb. 10, with 10 cm of dental pulp exposed. The elephant
lost 10,000 milliliters of blood.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Shenyang Zoo said the elephant continued to
eat after breaking its tusk. It pulled off five cm of dental pulp
with its own trunk, which reportedly is the elephant's instinct
for self-protection.

<P>
The elephant previously had broken its tusks twice.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that artificially fed elephants usually break
their tusks if they are too long.

He said the two people enjoy a long history of friendship and
the ancient "Silk Road" helped a large number of exchanges between

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian chairman of the
Supreme Soviet (parliament), Alexander Moroz, said Monday his
country's adoption of a proposal by western experts on economic
reform is "strategically wrong".
</P>
<P>
Moroz told the public in Lutsk that "liberalization and
privatization", introduced after Ukraine's independence in 1991 as
the mode of economic reform, has brought about ruin in social
areas.
</P>
<P>
The mistaken road of reform is among the causes which have led
to social and economic difficulties, the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Ukraine has accepted almost all preconditions
set in exchange for loans from the International Monetary Fund and
western countries. Under these Ukraine had to liberalize and
privatize its economy.
</P>
<P>
Changes had to be made on the principle of economic
restructuring which were "unfavorable to the society", Moroz
said.

<HEADLINE> El Nino-fed Rains Rampant in California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The EL Nino storms which
have caused havoc in California are going to get worse, say
meteorologists.
</P>
<P>
The rains will continue in the West Coast of the United States
for two more months, according to forecasts.
</P>
<P>
Ten people have died as the storms battered the state last
month. Seventy-six people have taken refuge in shelters as
hundreds of homes have been destroyed in hillslides.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary damage is estimated at 300 million U.S. dollars in 22
counties. Thirty-one of the state's 58 counties have been declared
in a state of emergency. Many roads are closed because of flooding
and mudslides.
</P>
<P>
An oil spill, estimated at between 8,400 and 21,000 gallons,
occurred in the Pacific Ocean when a landslide north of Los
Angeles ruptured a natural gas pipeline and a crude oil pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a sanitation system overflowed, sending 240,000
gallons of raw sewage onto the beach near Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
In northern California, fungi have invaded many flooded homes,
eating away at wood and discoloring carpets. Doctors warn that
molds can trigger allergies and may be dangerous for those with
asthma.
</P>
<P>
In the San Diego area in southern California, a rare mold has
been destroying dozens of wooden homes. Replacing floors and walls
would cost a home owner thousands of dollars each.
</P>
<P>
The EL Nino storms have also affected real estate in San
Francisco Bay area, discouraging home buyers and causing banks to
be more cautious in offering loans.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, S'pore Agree to Resolve Outstanding Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Singapore
have agreed to resolve a number of outstanding issues in their
bilateral relations to cooperate closely in the new millennium, a
joint communique said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The agreements reached between Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
and his Singapore counterpart Goh Chok Tong during their talks
here Monday have laid a "firm foundation" for both Malaysia and
Singapore to cooperate closely in the new millennium, said the
joint communique issued by the Foreign Ministry Tuesday at the end
of the two-day working visit by Goh.
</P>
<P>
In a clear signal that ties are back to normal after a lengthy
meeting between the two prime ministers, Malaysia and Singapore
will resume negotiations within 60 days to finalize a special
agreement to refer their overlapping claim on Pulau Batu Puteh to
the International Court of Justice, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations over the islet off Johor, southern Malaysia,
otherwise called Pedra Branca by Singapore, have been going on for
two years.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia agreed to continue supplying water to Singapore beyond
2061 and this undertaking would be confirmed in an agreement
within 60 days, according to the joint communique.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Malaysia agreed to continue the supply of
water to Singapore beyond the expiry of the 1961 Agreement in 2011
and the 1962 Agreement in 2061, as well as the 1990 Agreement
connected with it, on terms and conditions to be mutually agreed
between the two governments," it said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia supplies 214 million liters of raw water daily to
Singapore and buys back treated water from Singapore-owned plants
in Johor.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia and Singapore also agreed to intensify efforts to
resolve outstanding matters relating to the Points of Agreement
on land owned by Malaysian railway company -- Keretapi Tanah
Melayu Berhad (KTM) in Singapore, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir and Goh agreed they should work towards realizing the
full potential in the relations between the two countries based on
the principle of "prosper thy neighbor" in recognition of the
unique and special relationship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
They also recognized that the regional financial crisis had
further underscored the need for both countries to cooperate
closely in all possible areas.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia and Singapore would cooperate with each other and
their ASEAN partners to restore stability to regional currencies
and study the proposal of using regional currencies and other
options to finance intra-ASEAN trade.
</P>
<P>
They will intensify efforts to cooperate in banking and
finance.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also welcome investments from each other with
Singapore expressing full confidence in Malaysia's economic
prospects.
</P>
<P>
"In this respect, the two prime ministers highlighted the value
of cross-holdings in infrastructure and other economic sectors to
make both countries stakeholders in each other's prosperity and
long-term economic future," the communique said.
</P>
<P>
They welcome the establishment of a Malaysia-Singapore Business
Council by the private sector to enhance trade and investment as
well as to strengthen economic and business synergies amongst
their respective business entities.
</P>
<P>
Both sides also agreed to intensify bilateral cooperation in
tourism including manpower training.
</P>
<P>
Goh left here for home by road via Malacca where he will stay

<HEADLINE> Sweden, Czech Appeal Samuelsson Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Sweden and Czech Republic
have appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to review
the International Ice Hockey Federation's ruling on Sweden's
defenseman Ulf Samuelsson for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
The IIHF announced early Tuesday that Samuelsson was disqualifed
from the remainder of the Nagano Olympic Games ice hockey tournament
for losing his Swedish citizenship, but the IIHF Directorate voted to
maintain the quarter-final matchups as a result of the round robin
games played.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish delegation is appealing for reinstatement of the
34-year-old New York Rangers defenseman on the Swedish national team
despite his possession of an American passport, which under Swedish
law nulifies his Swedish citizenship.
</P>
<P>
Rickard Fagerlund, chairman of the Swedish Ice Hockey Association,
said that Samuelsson did not know the Swedish law.
</P>
<P>
Samuelsson who has played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for
over 13 years, applied for American citizenship only to simplify his
working situation in the United States, Fagerlund said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Czech Republic appealed to forfeit Sweden's
round-robin game results which led to the seedings in the
quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is pointing to Art. 204, point 7a of the IHHF
by-laws which states:"if the ineligibility of one or more players is
proved during a championship, then the games played with the
ineligible players shall be forfeited and the ineligible player shall
be dismissed from the tournament."
</P>
<P>
Czech team coach Ivan Hlinka said:"the rules are the rules."
</P>
<P>
If Sweden is made to forfeit its games, the Czechs would play
Belarus in the quarter-finals instead of the United States.

<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The per capita net income of
farmers in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region was
reported at 1,540 yuan for 1997.
</P>
<P>
This was attributed to local measures for developing the
private economy and spreading the use of agricultural technology.
</P>
<P>
Local statistics show that the region harvested 2.5 billion
kilograms of grain for two consecutive years. To promote
agricultural industrialization, the region has carried out 20
agronomy projects such as establishing commodity grain bases,
developing maize plastic film and potato processing.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the output of the region's township-run
enterprises, which are mainly engaged in the processing of farm
and related products, exceeded 8.8 billion yuan for 1997.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the local financial departments at all levels have
allocated 143 million yuan to help 12 major firms establish new
enterprise systems. The 12 firms, which have played an important
role in the local economy, gained 2.6 billion yuan in sales and
contributed more than 383 million yuan in taxes in 1997, up 13.4
percent and 12.2 percent, respectively, over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that the annual growth of output value and
sales of privately run enterprises and individual
household-operated firms both exceeded 30 percent. And the region
collected 1.36 billion yuan in revenues for 1997.

Official statistics show that the produced more than 35.6
billion kilograms (kg) of grain in 1997, a record high.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the good grain harvest last year is especially
significant as it was achieved in spite of serious natural
disasters.
</P>
<P>
The province suffered a dry spell in early summer followed by a
strong typhoon in August. At least 3.3 million hectares of
farmland was affected.
</P>
<P>
To counter the arid effects, Jiangsu officials pumped more than
13 billion cubic meters of water from the Yangtze River to the
farming area in the northern part of the province. Water
conservancy works also helped to minimize the effect of the
typhoon.

ROME, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Influenza has spread at such a
fast speed in Italy that an estimated six million people, 10
percent of the population, have caught the flu, Donato Greco of
the Superior Health Institute said Monday.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Isabella Donatelli, chief of the World Health Organization's

the data gathered so far indicated that "99 percent of the flu
cases this year are caused by the A-H3N2 virus."
</P>
<P>
This virus, detected in Milan last month, belongs to the A
strain which is decidedly more "lively" than the quieter B strain,
the type responsible for bringing influenza to the country in
recent years, said Donatelli.

Bosnia-Herzegovina in maintaining stability in the area.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel was speaking in Banja Luka at a meeting with Bosnian
Serb President Biljana Plavsic and Prime Minister Milorad Dodik.
</P>
<P>
The German foreign minister, on a one-day visit to the Bosnian

<HEADLINE> Tourist Arrivals in Indonesia Up 5 Percent in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Foreign tourist arrivals in
Indonesia rose by 5.04 percent last year to 5.03 million, below
the pessimistic target of 5.3 million, data from the Ministry of
Tourism, Post and Telecommunication showed.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said Monday that the country's foreign exchange
earnings from tourism rose to 6.62 billion U.S dollars from 6.3
billion dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The small increase of the foreign tourists was mainly due to
natural disasters such as forest fires and a plane crash taking
place in the country last year. The monetary crisis which hit the
Southeast Asian region, especially Indonesia, was also one of the
causes, officials of the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
They said the targeted foreign exchange revenues from tourism
of between 7.2 billion and 7.8 billion U.S. dollars last year
could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia had targeted that foreign tourist arrivals should
rise by 19 percent this year to between 6 million and 6.5 million
people.

<HEADLINE> Swedish Ice Hockey Defenseman Disqualified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The International Ice Hockey
Federation (IIHF) declared Tuesday that Swedish defenseman Ulf
Samuelsson ineligible for the remainder of the Nagano Olympic Games
because of his United States citizenship.
</P>
<P>
The IIHF Directorates, meeting in Nagano in the early hours Tuesday
morning, decided, however, not to re-pair the quarter-final matches
for the men's ice hockey tournament, leaving Group C winner Russia to
play the fourth-ranked team in Group D, Belarus.
</P>
<P>
If the matches had been re-paired according to the rankings taking
into account Sweden's forfeits, Russia would have had to play Sweden,
a much stronger squad than Belarus.
</P>
<P>
Sweden, the defending Olympic champion, stood to lose the two
victories it earned in round robin group matches and be relegated to
last in its group over Samuelsson's U.S. citizenship.
</P>
<P>
Samuelsson, who plays for the New York Rangers of the North
American National Hockey League (NHL), played for his native Sweden in
the Olympic ice hockey tournament in Nagano while holding a United
States passport.
</P>
<P>
IIHF officials and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) ruled
early Tuesday morning that since Samuelsson had acquired U.S.
citizenship, he had automatically lost Swedish citizenship under the
laws of Sweden and was not eligible to play in the tournament.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic will
appeal an decision of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF)
not to strip Sweden of two round-robin victories which it gained using
a player subsequently ruled ineligible, Czech attache Ladislav Josef
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An appeal would be submitted to the Court of Arbitration for Sport
today, Josef said.
</P>
<P>
The IIHF Directorate declared early Tuesday Ulf Samuelssonof Team
Sweden ineligible to compete for Sweden because the 34-year-old New
York Rangers defenseman has an American passport.
</P>
<P>
Under Swedish law, Samuelsson automatically loses his Swedish
citizenship on acquiring the citizenship of another country.
</P>
<P>
Article 204, point 7a of the IIHF bylaws state:"If the
ineligibility of one or more players is proved during a championship,
then the games played with the ineligible players shall be forfeited
and the ineligible player shall be dismissed from the tournament."
</P>
<P>
If the CAS overturns the IIHF decision, the Czechs would play
Belarus in the quarter-finals instead of the United States.
</P>
<P>
"The change will be that we would play against Belarus, but that's
not the main reason for the appeal," Josef said. "We think that the
decision was not right."
</P>
<P>
The Czechs finished round-robin play with a 2-1 record in Group C,
while Sweden was 2-1 in Group D.
</P>
<P>
The placings in round robin determined quater-final matchups.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Consult IMF on Currency Board System Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
consult the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over its plan to
adopt a currency board system (CBS) which would peg the rupiah
(national currency) to a fixed exchange rate, a senior official
said.
</P>
<P>
State Minister of National Development Planning Ginandjar
Kartasasmita told a hearing at the House of Representatives Monday
that the CBS was one of several alternatives being considered by
the government to shore up the rupiah, the press reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing now is to bring the rupiah's value to
a normal level. The IMF's economic reform package has not had the
desired effect," he said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF, he added, had not been able to guarantee that its
reform package would restore the rupiah's exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
According to the IMF-led bailout package, Indonesia has
conducted a series of economic and financial reforms including
adjusting its 1998/99 state budget and closing 16 private banks.
</P>
<P>
He said no currency system was perfect, but the CBS concept had
proven capable of solving monetary crises in Argentina and Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
The government has disclosed its intention to adopt the CBS,
with analysts predicting the rupiah would be pegged to a level of
5,000 to the American dollar, compared with 10,000 rupiah per
dollar Monday.
</P>
<P>
Many economists and the IMF and the United States, however,
warn that the CBS cannot be put in place in Indonesia unless it
tightens its banking system first and restores confidence in the
rupiah.
</P>
<P>
Under the system, money supply must be fully backed by foreign
reserves in the currency to which the rupiah is pegged.
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar refused to comment on a report by the Washington Post
that IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus had written to
President Soeharto criticizing the currency board plan.
</P>
<P>
The report said that in the letter Camdessus threatened to
withhold further disbursement of the 43 billion U.S. dollars
rescue package that the IMF organized for Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has not commented on the letter.
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar said that anyone opposed to the CBS should come up
with an alternative solution to restore the rupiah's value.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has lost about 80 percent of its value against the
greenback since July last year when it traded at 2,400 per dollar.

<P>
CARACAS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Cesar Gaviria, Secretary
General of the American States Organization (OEA) has declared
itself against the inflow of illegal money to electoral campaigns
aimed at defending democracy in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Illegal money in election campaigns is a constant concern on
all around Latin-America, Gaviria said at the meeting on
contributions to electoral campaigns which starts Monday and ends
Tuesday in Caracas.
</P>
<P>
Democracy defense shoud be based on free, periodical and
transparent elections in which candidates may compete on equal
conditions. he added.
</P>
<P>
If money has the power to distort electoral process, then free
and transparent elections can not be achieved and this will
seriously engage legitimacy of the electoral process, said Gaviria.
</P>
<P>
According to Venezuela's initiative, the forum sponsored by the
OEA, counts with the participation of representatives coming from
17 different American countries and 11 observers from other
continents.
</P>
<P>
We should first focus on avoiding corruption, which may become
a very serious problem when money is not coming from a legitimate
source but from criminal activities, being the outcomes of those
activities even more illegal, said Gaviria.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, political equality is essential to avoid important
unbalances in access to power coming from money, he added.
</P>
<P>
Third, reduce cost of election campaigns and fourth, protect
credibility and integrity of the political system, Gaviria
declared.

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank to Retain High Interest Rate Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand's policy
of high short-term interest rates will remain in light of the
recent volatility of the baht, according to the bank's governor
Chaiyawat Wibulswasdi.
</P>
<P>
The central bank is closely monitoring development in Indonesia
and their efforts to establish a currency board to fix the value
of the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
Regional currencies dived Monday against the dollar, with the
baht closing at 47.4 versus 46.15 last Friday. Analysts said the
decline Monday stemmed from the deterioration of investor
sentiment about Indonesia's commitment to the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) reform program.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the IMF sent a stern warning to the Indonesian
government that it would withdraw its assistance if it continues
with plans to set up a currency board.
</P>
<P>
Chaiyawat was quoted Tuesday by the press as saying that the
central bank remained committed to maintaining short-term interest
rates at high levels to ensure stability in the baht.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is sensitive. There is a necessity for the
central bank to maintain interest rates in the bond repurchase
market at 19-20 percent, which is considered low given the present
situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chaiyawat said last week's strengthening of the baht to 42-43
to the dollar was a temporary reaction to news that a currency
board might be introduced in Indonesia.

<P>
COLOMBO, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Infiltrators of the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have stepped up their attacks on
troops in the Jaffna peninsula, military sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that intensified rebel movements have been
observed since the January 29 local government elections in the
north.
</P>
<P>
A small group of infiltrators have been active in this area in
the past two weeks, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The peninsula, once a stronghold of the LTTE, is currently
under the control of government troops.
</P>
<P>
The military believed the intensified attacks in the peninsula
and the recent massive strike on military positions at Elephant
Pass, Paranthan and Kilinochchi in the north were part of a rebel
strategy to delay the advance of troops involved in Operation
Jayasikuru (Certain of Victory).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the military have also stepped up their offensive
against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
They have surrounded the town of Mankulam, a strategic northern
town held by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Fierce fighting erupted in the past few days in the area. The
military said the town could be taken within a couple of days.
Casualties on both sides are expected to be high.
</P>
<P>
The separatist LTTE has been fighting an ethnic war with the
government troops in the north and east of the country since 1983.

<P>
MOSCOW, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Russia is ready to join the
World Trade Organization (WTO), but only under conditions that
serve Russia's interests.
</P>
<P>
Mikhai Fradkov, Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and
Trade, told Interfax News Agency staff Monday that Russia will not
pay an untold price for the admission.
</P>
<P>
Fradkov said that 1998 is a decisive year for Russia in which
to negotiate with the WTO over entrance into the organization. The
WTO came into being in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
A first-phase of talks over Russia's entry was completed last
year. Preparations for the second round of talks over conditions
for foreign goods entering Russia's markets are well underway, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Russia would not rush ahead with negotiations
without considering conditions for accession.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations for Russia's admission are very tough. Some
Western countries have demanded that Russia quickly open its
markets and substantially lower its import tariffs.
</P>
<P>
For its part, Russia will only open up its market in phases,
and says it would be very difficult to reduce import tariffs
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
The 125-member WTO is an important international body which is
responsible for world order of economy and trade.

<P>
BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese civil air industry
will further open to the outside world, increase its use of
foreign investment and continue to enhance economic and
technological cooperation with international enterprises of same

Aviation Administration of China (CAAC).
 In an interview with reporters, Shen said the Chinese air
industry has achieved marked results in opening-up and use of
foreign capital. Shen added that the industry has used foreign
funds of 16.2 billion U.S. dollars since the 1980s, including
leases for 267 transport aircraft involving foreign funds of 13.9
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-two joint ventures and cooperative enterprises have been

</P>
<P>
The Chinese air industry will make new progress in cooperation
with foreign partners in concert with concerned domestic and
foreign departments, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
The industry expects to further attract foreign funds to run
air companies and jointly operate airports, Shen said, adding that
foreign investors will have 35 percent of stock rights if their
investment accounts for 35 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign air companies have expressed a willingness to
cooperate with China to develop the air transport market because
of China's great potential in such market, Shen said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Thailand Monday made a major
change to its 8th National Economic and Social Development Plan
(1997-2001), putting priority on stabilizing the monetary and
financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's National Economic and Social Development Board
(NESDB) made the change at a meeting in the light of the economic
and financial crisis facing the country.
</P>
<P>
The meeting assigned a committee to accelerate the reform of
financial institutions, relax regulations to promote foreign
direct investment, improve liquidity for export-oriented
industries and the budget management following the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) requirements.
</P>
<P>
The others three major issues that the revised national plan
focus on are to strengthen the country's capacity to earn foreign
currency, ease the social impact, and improve the management of
government agencies.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has decided to set up related committees to
tackle these issues respectively, including a bureaucratic
adjustment committee, an income distribution committee, and a
committee to solve the unemployment problem, newspapers reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The government has assigned the committees to take steps to
enhance the competitiveness in agricultural, industrial and
services sectors and strengthen the private sector's role in state
enterprises.

BANGKOK, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Embassy in Baghdad is

the event of an attack by America and Britain, according to the
Thai Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The plan provides for evacuation by car from Baghdad to Amman

quoted Tuesday by the press as saying.
</P>
<P>
The embassy has applied for Jordanian entry visas for the
Thais, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Among the Thais now in Iraq are 14 officials and embassy
employees, 23 students and six of unknown occupation.
</P>
<P>

<P>
China progressed in reforming the civil air industry last year,
especially in issuing joint stock, listings and merging air
transport enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Three civil air companies were listed four times involving
collected funds of 12 billion yuan, Shen said, adding that China
will continue to raise funds and change the capital structure by
listing enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Shen said there are several companies waiting to be listed at
home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Facing a merger trend in the international air industry, CAAC
will continue to pursue strategy of forming big companies and
groups, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 34 air companies in China with legal status are
small, Shen said, adding that it is estimated that several big
companies and groups will be formed over time with total assets of
40 billion yuan and annual sales of 30 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
However, the scope of the biggest existing civil air company
only accounts for one-third of the above-mentioned goal, according
to Shen, who expressed optimism about the future of the Chinese
civil air industry.
</P>
<P>
Discussing development goals, Shen said that China's air
transport turnover is estimated at 14 billion tons/kilometer by
year 2000; the transport capacity of tourists, 100 million; cargo
and mail volume, 200,000 tons; and an annual growth rate of 14
percent.
</P>
<P>
Shen said China will maintain its increase rate of 10 percent
in the air industry in the first 10 years of the next century.
</P>
<P>
China will then become a giant of the air industry among the
advanced civil air industry worldwide, Chen said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Oil Products Demand Down 10 Percent in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's consumption of oil
products and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) continued to decline in
January, especially in the transport and manufacturing sectors,
the press reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Consumption of oil products averaged 100.8 million liters per
day, down by 10 percent from January last year, the Department of
Commercial Registration was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Oil products used mainly in the transport and manufacturing
sectors included high-speed diesel, down 18 percent to 40.7
million liters per day, bunker oil, down 7 percent to 21.9 million
liters, and LPG, down 3 percent to 4,790 tons per day.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the department said the country's exports of surplus
oil products also declined in January. Shipments averaged 13.7
million liters per day, down 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The department attributed the drop to slowing demand throughout
most of slump-hit Asia and efforts by other regional countries to
export their surpluses.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's exports included six million liters per day of
high-speed diesel, 5.6 million liters of gasoline and 1,074 tons
of LPG.

<HEADLINE> Forum on Contributions in Elections Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from 17
American countries began a meeting today in Caracas to review
measures aimed to deter incoming of illegal resources to electoral
campaigns in the region.
</P>
<P>
The two days forum is sponsored by the Organization of American
States (OEA) on Venezuela's initiative counting with the
participation of 11 representatives from other continents.
</P>
<P>
Cesar Gaviria, Secretary General of the OEA, said in a speech
that to guarantee democracy, one should assure celebration of
free, transparent and periodical elections.
</P>
<P>
He added that illegal money in electoral campaigns constitutes
an increasing concern on all places of America, because this kind
of money seriously compromises legitimacy of democratic systems.
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan chancellor Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas said that
corruption is threatening democracy legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
Burelli Rivas proposed that electoral campaigns be brief and
transparent and contributions not lead the process, because
divulgation of image and ideas of the candidates is a grant from
the State to everybody.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting some issues will be addressed like campaigns
financing and efforts of each country to face the situation.
</P>
<P>
The debate will be based in three points such as nature and
limits of the contributions to electoral campaigns, origin and
equity of electoral contributions.
</P>
<P>
In relation to first point, we will try to define what is
understood by contribution, being also part of the group a variety
of elements such as vehicles, office equipment, realty, land,
including coverage of means of communication.
</P>
<P>
About the control of financing origin, it has to do with
verifying the character of contributions and relating to equity,
liberty of resources bounded to that kind of enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Political, economical and social circumstances which feature
the current context of democracies around the globe, will also be
addressed.
</P>
<P>
Participants will deliberate about the capacity of legal
regulation in force on different countries to control and limit
the cost of contributions to electoral campaigns.
</P>
<P>
The Under-Secretary of juridical Issues of the OEA will be
entrusted with analysis of mechanisms for Inter-American
cooperations and the elaboration of a comparative analysis of a
legal regulation model.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Step Up Fight Against AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar Health Minister Ket
Sein has stressed the need to step up fight against AIDS in the
country with precautionary measures taken.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of the Myanmar Central Committee for
Prevention and Eradication (CCPE) of AIDS here Monday, Ket Sein,
who is also the committee chairman, said the health department's
AIDS eradication program is being extensively undertaken
throughout the country with the help of government and
non-governmental organizations, United Nations agencies and in
cooperation with other ASEAN member states.
</P>
<P>
Official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar Tuesday quoted the
minister as saying that the program covers blood transfusion which
is totally free from virus and constant monitoring on the rate of
HIV infection and the spread of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that 0.79 percent of blood donors in the capital
of Yangon were found to have infected with HIV virus in September
1997 compared with 1.45 percent in Mandalay, the country's second
largest city, adding that the figure may be described as high in
Myanmar where there is a considerable number of blood donors.
</P>
<P>
He called for blood donation free from HIV virus.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar CCPE of AIDS was formed in 1989.
</P>
<P>
According to an official review of the finance, economic and
social conditions for fiscal year 1996-97, serological tests were
carried out for more than 70,000 people in 100 townships in the
fiscal year with education on AIDS disseminated.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's controlling and prevention of AIDS was initiated in
1992. However, the authorities have not yet disclosed the number
of HIV/AIDS-infected persons in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials of Myanmar and neighboring Thailand met in
Yangon last August, seeking ways of controlling HIV/AIDS in the
two countries' border areas under a Myanmar-Thai joint program.

<TEXT>
<P>
THE HAGUE, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Sino-Dutch relations have
improved and advanced in recent years, and contacts between the
two governments and parliaments are on rise, Chinese Premier Li
Peng said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The exchange visits would serve to enhance mutual
understanding, as China valued its ties with the Netherlands, Li
said in a meeting with Pieter Bukman, president of the Second
Chamber of the Netherlands, and Jan Postma, deputy president of
the First Chamber.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier, who is here on an official good-will
visit, noted that the parliament-to-parliament friendly
relationship is an important part of the state-to-state ties.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that the Chinese National People's Congress has
cherished a good relationship with the Dutch parliament. "We thus
extend a welcoming hand to the Dutch parliamentary leaders to
visit China so as to strengthen their understanding of China," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Li said that good economic ties could help improve political
ties, and good political relations could also serve to enhance the
development of the economic relations.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that in order to improve political ties it was
necessary to deepen mutual understanding and trust, and leaders at
all levels had to maintain contacts and exchange visits.
</P>
<P>
The premier also briefed the Dutch parliamentarians on the
formation, development and functions of the Chinese people's
congress system.
</P>
<P>
Bukman said the Dutch parliament felt very honored to receive
Li and was glad about the continuous improvement and progress of
the Dutch-Chinese relations.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the political ties laid a good foundation for the
development of economic relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Dutch parliamentarians were very interested in China's growth
and changes, Bukman said, adding that many of them hope to have
chance to visit China.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Denies Planned Meeting for Hun Sen, Ranariddh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has denied that it
has a plan to arrange a meeting between Cambodia's Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen and Prince Norodom Ranariddh in Bangkok, a
national newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will send Deputy Foreign Minister Sukhumbhand
Paribatra to Cambodia to assure Hun Sen on that issue, The Nation
Tuesday quoted a senior Thai government source as saying.
</P>
<P>
It is groundless that Thailand has extended an invitation for
Hun Sen to visit Thailand as it plans to organize a meeting
between Hun Sen and Prince Ranariddh, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The source said that Hun Sen welcomed the invitation to
Thailand, but he reacted strongly to reports that he would meet
Ranariddh in Bangkok by saying that he would turn down the
invitation.
</P>
<P>
Sukhumbhand's planned visit to Cambodia will try to assure Hun
Sen that his visit to Bangkok will be to discuss with Thai Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai ways to strengthen bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Thailand earlier officially announced that it is ready to
mediate between the Cambodian rivals if both sides wish to and
Prince Ranariddh has expressed welcome to the Thai initiative.
</P>
<P>
Chuan met with Prince Ranariddh last week in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) reportedly
also will send a high-ranking official to Cambodia to hold
consultation with Hun Sun.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Dutch PMs Agree on Strengthened Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE HAGUE, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng and
Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok on Monday both expressed hope that
relations between China and the Netherlands are further
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting here Monday morning, Li Peng and Kok exchanged
views on a wide range of subjects related to bilateral ties and
regional and international issues of common interest. They reached
broad consensus.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said the Netherlands was among the earliest countries
in Western Europe to establish diplomatic ties with China.
</P>
<P>
In general, he said, relations between the two countries had
greatly developed since the establishment of diplomatic ties, and
the increase of exchanges at high levels in recent years had
strengthened and expanded bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Remarkable achievements have been made in economic and trade
cooperation and in cooperation in such areas as science,
technology and culture, said the Chinese premier.
</P>
<P>
Li said, China and the Netherlands have quite a few points in
common in safeguarding world peace and promoting economic
development, despite the differences in their histories and
cultural backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
China, he said, attaches due importance to the development of
friendship and cooperation with the Netherlands, which now has
great potential as well as a good opportunity for further growth.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said the Chinese government is willing to join efforts
with the government of the Netherlands, on the basis of mutual
respect and mutual benefit, in strengthening the exchanges and
cooperation between the two countries in various areas, so as to
facilitate the healthy, stable and smooth development of bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
He also said that enterprises in the Netherlands could have a
larger share of the market in China if they could bring to full
play their own advantages against the background of continued
deepening reform and opening-up in China.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Kok expressed satisfaction over the
increase in trade between the Netherlands and China. He said his
country will continue to increase investment in China.
</P>
<P>
He said the Netherlands will also increase inputs into China's
domestic development projects related to environmental protection,
poverty alleviation and countryside development.
</P>
<P>
Kok said a large delegation of entrepreneurs from the
Netherlands will soon visit China to explore new ways of
strengthening economic and trade cooperation between the two
countries as well as for specific cooperation projects.
</P>
<P>
Apart from large enterprises, more and more small and
medium-sized enterprises are now taking a growing interest in
entering into cooperation with China, said Kok.
</P>
<P>
He said his government supports China's entry into the World
Trade Organization.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah Weakens Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian rupiah again
crossed the 10,000 barrier against the U.S. dollar Monday on
growing international concern over a fixed exchange rate plan for
the currency and spreading riots in the country.
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers here said Tuesday that criticism from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the U.S. on Indonesia's
proposal to proceed with a currency board system (CBS) caused the
rupiah to fall in early trading Monday.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah opened weaker after it was revealed over the weekend
that the IMF sent a letter to President Soeharto saying it may
suspend further aid, a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Spot rupiah opened at 9,500/10,000 Monday, lower than last
week's close of 8,200 and continued to weaken to the day's low of
10,700 by mid-morning. It rebounded slightly in the afternoon and
closed at 9,700/9,900.
</P>
<P>
"News of Indonesia planning to adopt the currency board system
plays a significant role in the currency market," dealers said.
</P>
<P>
Some currency dealers speculated that the rupiah would be
pegged at the fixed exchange rate of between 5,000 and 6,000 to
the dollar, a level they categorized as unrealistic and
unsustainable.
</P>
<P>
"The rupiah at that level would be costly and unsustainable in
a time of lost confidence in the economy, banking system and the
whole system," a chief dealer with a local private bank said.
</P>
<P>
State Minister of National Development Planning Ginandjar
Kartasasmita said Monday that the government would consult the IMF
over its CBS plan.
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said international concern over spreading
riots in the country also put more pressure on the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
While the rupiah weakened, stock prices on the Jakarta Stock
Exchange rose 2.1 percent, with the composite index closing 9.15
points higher at 448.15.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Dutch PMs Exchange Views on Sino-EU Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE HAGUE, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng and
Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok exchanged views Monday on relations
between China and European Union countries, the issue of human
rights as well as other issues.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Kok here this morning, Li said China attaches
due importance to Europe as well as to the role of the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
Europe and the EU, said the Chinese premier, should play a more
important role in international affairs in the process of the
multipolarization of the world.
</P>
<P>
He said China is willing to strengthen cooperation with the EU
and make its due contribution to the establishment of a new type
of partnership between Asia and Europe. China will take an active
part in the Asia-Europe Conference and play a constructive role in
it, added Li.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Kok said the EU should strengthen dialogue with
China, which he believes will not only benefit the development of
the two continents but also help them meet international
challenges of various kinds.
</P>
<P>
He said the Netherlands is optimistic about the political
dialogue between the EU and China, as a meeting of heads of
government between them is to be held during the Second
Asia-Europe Conference in April.
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides will conduct their dialogue under the
spirit of partnership and on the basis of mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of human rights, Li said China and the EU held
their fourth dialogue in Beijing in December last year, during
which the two sides exchanged views on human rights issues,
especially on the strengthening of cooperation in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The two sides expressed their willingness for better
cooperation in this area and also reached consensus on a number of
specific projects of cooperation, he added.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China and the EU, in their viewpoints on the issue
of human rights, have common ground as well as differences,
stemming from their different historical backgrounds, cultural
traditions, social systems and levels of economic development.
</P>
<P>
He said that China favors the way of conducting dialogue to
increase mutual understanding and reduce differences and does not
approve the practice of confrontation as it hampers the
development of relations between states.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of human rights, Kok agreed that constructive
dialogue should be conducted on the basis of mutual respect, so as
to increase mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting this morning, the two leaders also exchanged
views on Iraq crisis, the monetary crisis in Asia and the
integration process of the EU.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Myanmar State
Peace and Development Council (SPDC) Senior General Than Shwe left
here for Manila Tuesday morning on a three-day state visit to the
Philippines at the invitation of Philippine President Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
Than Shwe's 40-member entourage comprises his wife Daw Kyaing
Kyaing, SPDC First Secretary Lieutenant General Khin Nyunt,
Foreign Minister U Ohn Gyaw and other officials.
</P>
<P>
During Than Shwe's visit in the Philippines, three or four

expected to be signed, according to diplomatic sources.
</P>
<P>
This is Than Shwe's return visit to the Philippine president's
to Myanmar last October and is also the first trip of the Myanmar
leader to a fellow member state of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) this year.
</P>
<P>
During Ramos' last visit in Yangon, Myanmar and the Philippines
agreed to further promote the cooperation between the two
countries in various fields, reaching four accords or memorandums
of understanding on trade, the establishment of a joint commission
for bilateral cooperation, cooperation against illicit
trafficking and abuse of narcotics and psychotropic substances,
and the promotion of technical cooperation in forestry and
forest-industrial development.

The two leaders also voiced their commitment to the realization
 of the goal of the ASEAN to achieve dynamic partnership in the
political, economic and social areas.

So far, the Philippines' investments in Myanmar amount to 6.67
million U.S. dollars, according to official statistics.

<TEXT>
<P>
THE HAGUE, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
Monday that developing Sino-Dutch friendship and cooperation
served the interests of both countries.
</P>
<P>
Enhancing cooperation between Asia and Europe was part of a
trend and growing consultation and cooperation was conducive to
world peace and development, said Li at a banquet given in his
honor by Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier said that he had extensive and friendly
talks with members of the Dutch business and financial communities.
</P>
<P>
He said the framework agreement on petrochemical cooperation
signed between the two countries Monday morning was a testimony to
the tremendous potential and broad prospect of economic and
technological cooperation between China and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Li praised the Dutch people as a nation of "diligence, wisdom
and pioneering spirit" who have built a beautiful country with a
remarkable vision.
</P>
<P>
"Today, they have once again boasted outstanding achievements
in a number of fields, ranging from shipping, ship-building,
chemical industry, electronics to water conservancy, agriculture
and animal husbandry," said Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
China was forging ahead and the Netherlands was developing
further, Li said, adding, "I am confident that with the concerted
efforts, China-Netherlands friendly relations and cooperation will
enter into a new stage of development."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Kok said that the visit by Li Peng demonstrated
the good relationship between the Netherlands and China that had
built cooperation in many fields.
</P>
<P>
Though the two countries were different in history and culture,
the Dutch and Chinese peoples had much in common, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that trade was increasing with the Netherlands
becoming the fourth largest trading partner with China among the
European Union states.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between the two countries in science, education and
culture was based on mutual benefit and mutual respect, Kok said.
</P>
<P>
Both Asia and Europe were facing serious challenges at the turn
of the century, he added.
</P>
<P>
"But our cooperation forged on the basis of friendship and
efficiency will create a future with bright prospects," the Dutch
prime minister stated.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. President
George Bush said on Monday that he was right not to overthrow
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein at the end of the Gulf War in
1991 because he fear the move could endanger a coalition just
created in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"Had we gone into Baghdad or in to try and 'get him'
somewhere, the coalition would have been ... instantly
shattered," he said in an interview with CNN, which is to be
aired on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The Turks would have left us, Syria would have been long
gone, even our steadfast ally and friend (Egyptian President)
Hosni Mubarak would have had to leave us," he added.
</P>
<P>
Bush was responding to some critics who called him a
"revisionist" for failing to oust Saddam when the U.S.-led
coalition force drove the Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
"We would have essentially been alone as an occupying (power)
in an Arab land," Bush said.

TAIYUAN, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The largest water fall along
Yellow River, China's second longest, is attracting tourists to
the Hukou area of Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The recent low temperatures in north China caused the giant ice
bridge on the 50 meter-wide waterfall, slowing the torrent of
water with blocks of ice, and producing an ice "dragon" more than
five meters high in the river itself.
</P>

The phenomenon is extremely rare, according to a local man in
his 80s. The strange occurrence may be able to stay until early
March if there is no sudden warming, officials say.

GUIYANG, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Endangered plant species have
been doing well in the Leigongshan Nature Reserve in southwest
China's Guizhou Province owing to the work of researchers.
</P>
<P>
The reserve, which has about 1,390 plant species, has become a
sanctuary for many endangered species.
</P>
<P>
One of these is Taiwania Flousiana, a tree with a dense grain
that reaches a height of 30 to 40 meters with a long growing
period. The tree has been listed as the top protection list in the
reserve, one of the three areas in China where the plant still
grows. It is also the biggest in area and in number of plants.
</P>
<P>
There are also 462 varieties of medicinal herbs, 518 kinds of
animals, and a gene data bank of various species.
</P>
<P>
The nature reserve has cultivated 500 kg seedlings of the
Taiwania Flousiana on a 1.2-ha area and has also cultivated more
than 20,000 seedlings of the fir of genus ormosia, an extremely
rare species, which produces a substance highly effective in

<HEADLINE> Belgian Grand Prix in Danger of being Cancelled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- FIA, motorsport's world
governing body, said here on Monday that they would make a
decision after studying documents sent by Belgian Grand Prix
authorities, who are fighting to save their race from being
cancelled.
</P>
<P>
"We received a number of documents from the Belgian authorities
which we are looking at and once we have completed that we will
release a statement announcing our decision," a FIA spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
It seemed that the chance of staging the Belgian Grand Prix has
been denied after Belgium court is to ban tobacco advertising and
sponsorship from next year.
</P>
<P>
The court upheld the right of Belgium's federal parliament to
pass legislation relating to public health, rejecting a claim by
the region of Wallonia, which hosts the race, and the grand prix's
organisers that this was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
FIA, Formula One's governing body, warned last month that this
year's race, scheduled for August 30 at the Spa Francorchamps
circuit, would be cancelled unless the sport was granted an
exemption from the anti-tobacco law by February 15.
</P>
<P>
South Africa and China are both standing by, ready to stage the
race if FIA acts next week to move the race away from Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Although cars will be free to carry tobacco logos at this
year's race, the introduction of the new law next year will mean
FIA is unable to honour commitments given to the Formula One
teams under four-year contracts.

12 February, just before the prompt March contract expired, open
interest had reached more than 242000 lots, or over 242 million
barrels.
</P>
<P>
This level is equivalent to more than three times world daily
oil consumption.
</P>
<P>
Volumes of activity for Brent Crude have been exceptionally
high this year. Last month was the busiest ever recorded for the
contract with trade averaging around 55000 lots a day.
</P>
<P>
It is commonly believed here that one of the reasons for the
increased activity has been the collapse in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
An usually mild winter in the northern hemisphere has reduced
demand for heating fuels and other energy products, and the
financial crisis in the Asia Pacific region has led to concern that
demand growth in this consuming region might be slower than
previously anticipated.
</P>
<P>
This has seen prices falling to their lowest levels for almost
4 years, reaching 14.50/bl on 12 February and representing a fall
of almost $6/bl from the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Open interest represents the number of positions outstanding,
that is those that have not been canceled out by an equal and
opposite transaction.
</P>
<P>
The IPE Brent Crude futures contract is one of the world's most
important pricing indicators for the oil industry.

<HEADLINE> Premier Li on China's Policy Toward EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE HAGUE, Netherlands, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier
Li Peng said Monday that both China and the European Union are
important forces on the international arena and it is a key
component of China's foreign policy to develop a long-term stable
relationship with the 15-nation union.
</P>
<P>
Li, on a four-day official good-will visit at the invitation of
Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok, described the relationship as
all-round and mutually-beneficial for China and EU member states.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese visitor made the remark during a welcome luncheon
given in his honor by Dutch Economy Minister G.J. Wijers.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said that the recent years had witnessed swift
restoration or progress of relations between China and EU member
states. "Our bilateral cooperation in the political, economic,
trade and other fields has continued to expand and develop in
depth," he added.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between China and EU stood at 43 billion U.S.
dollars last year, three times more than that of 1993.
</P>
<P>
EU countries have invested a total of 11.5 billion dollars in
over 8,000 projects in China, the Chinese premier said. The sound
economic relations and trade between China and EU has in turn laid
a solid foundation for the all-round advancement of bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
As the 21st century is approaching, Li Peng said, China and
Europe share more and more converging points amidst the new trend
toward accelerated multi-polarity.
</P>
<P>
The converging points include having no conflict of fundamental
interests; enjoying great complementarity in the economic, trade
and technological fields; sharing identical or similar views on
many major international issues; both agreeing to handle
state-to-state relations in accordance with the norms governing
international relations as identified by the United Nations
Charter; acknowledging their respective advantages in education
and culture; and being greatly concerned over the problems
affecting the survival and development of humanity.
</P>
<P>
Divergence on some issues, the Chinese premier pointed out,
between China and European countries due to their differences in
social system, values and ideology is by no means the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
"Those areas we share in common are predominant and constitute
the foundation of our cooperation," said Li. "To enhance our
cooperation and exchanges in economic, trade and other fields and
strive to lift China-EU relations to a new high are not only the
pressing demand of the times, but also the common task before our
two sides."
</P>
<P>
By firmly grasping the converging points of respective
interests, China and EU should strive to establish a just and
rational international economic relationship which will complement
each other's strong points to offset one's weakness for common
development, Li Peng stressed.
</P>
<P>
China is among the fastest-growing economies in the world while
Europe commands advanced technologies and abundant capital in
search for good investment destination and commodity market. The
two sides, therefore, are in very good position to learn from each
other's strong points to offset one's own weaknesses through
wide-ranging technological cooperation and trade.
</P>
<P>
Enterpreneurs from western Europe are welcome to come to China
and set up wholly-owned enterprises, joint ventures and
cooperative ventures, the Chinese premier said. European
entrepreneurs who want to have a share in China's market need to
face the reality and be future-oriented with far-sightedness, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in the Netherlands, Li Peng met with Dutch
business people and economists on two occasions to brief them on
the latest development of China's economy.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier said that what China needs most are
resource-based products, high and new technologies and
technological equipment that cannot be manufactured in China.
</P>
<P>
Li also encouraged both sides to step up exchanges of economic
information and personnel, not only between government departments
but between enterprises of all sizes and various localities.
</P>
<P>
The visiting premier said that the financial sector of western
economy enjoys a long history and rich experience. "Our two sides
may strengthen consultation and cooperation in this field so as to
learn from each other and work together to ward off financial
risks and maintain financial stability."
</P>
<P>
At the luncheon, Li disclosed that the Dutch economy minister
is visiting China soon with a large contingent of some 70 business
people.
</P>
<P>
"Seeing is believing," said the Chinese premier who said that a
trip to China would help the Dutch business people and economists
better understand his country.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government has all along attached importance to
developing its friendly relations and cooperation with the
Netherlands and has made unremitting effort to this end," said Li
Peng who leaves Amsterdam on Tuesday for Moscow to continue his
European tour that started in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
"We are glad to see that considerable progress has been
recorded in the China-Netherlands relations in recent years with
more high-level exchanges and fruitful cooperation in the fields
of economy, trade, science, technology and culture," said Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch economy minister said that the size of his
Beijing-bound delegation is unprecedented and the size shows the
confidence the Dutch business and industry circles have placed on
China and their enthusiasm to cooperate with their Chinese
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Wijers hoped that his visit will enhance the mutual
understanding and promote the economy, trade and technology
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> UK Conservative Party to Undertake Radical Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- British Conservative Party
leader William Hague launched a major reform of the party on
Monday in a bid to revive it after a defeat in last May's general
election.
</P>
<P>
Hague said the Conservatives would be turned into Britain's
most democratic party through his biggest ever change in a
century.
</P>
<P>
"We are turning our greatest defeat into our greatest
opportunity," Hague told his party members and a group of
journalists.
</P>
<P>
"Today I present to you...the most radical and comprehensive
reforms to a political party in modern British political history,
the most radical reforms to the Conservative Party since the time
of Disraeli," he said.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Disraeli was the most famous Conservative leader of
the Victorian era. His heyday was as prime minister between 1874
and 1880.
</P>
<P>
Hague's reform plan include declining money from abroad and
publishing details of all donations of more than 5,000 pounds
($8,200). He also plans a new ethics and integrity committee.
</P>
<P>
To attract new members, especially younger ones, Hague is
offering to consult them about policy and give them a vote in the
selection of parliamentary candidates and the party leader.
</P>
<P>
"Our members are going to become the most informed, involved,
listened-to and consulted members of any political party in
Britain today," Hague said.
</P>
<P>
Hague was elected to replace John Major as leader after the May
1 election when the Conservatives, after 18 years ruling Britain,
were reduced to just 165 of the 659 seats in the House of Commons.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Favors Coordination in Use of Nile Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Acting Minister of
Irrigation Nafei Ali Nafei Monday emphasized the importance of
coordination between Sudan and Egypt for the optimum use of the
Nile water.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 38th session of the Joint Sudanese-Egyptian Nile
Water Authority, which began its work Monday, Nafei stressed the
strategic importance of water of the two countries, which are
scarce in water resources.
</P>
<P>
He said that a factor threatening the water security of the
Nile basin states lies in the interference of world powers and
certain organizations in the utilization of the water resources of
the Nile.
</P>
<P>
He called for concerted cooperation and measures by concerned
parties in implementing international laws to head off the threats.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Public Works and Water Resources Mahmoud
Abdel Halim Abu Zeid said the challenges facing Egypt and Sudan
are represented in water resources and struggle in the field all
over the world.
</P>
<P>
He appealed for closer bilateral ties and common action to
develop water resources through the implementation of the upper
Nile projects.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian minister called for the utilization of waste water
and the exploitation of the Nile River and its tributaries, and
the devotion of greater interest in water research activity.
</P>
<P>
Sudan and Egypt signed an agreement in 1959 to decide their
shares of the Nile water.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Consults with Arab Leaders on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel has held consultations on telephone with leaders of some
Arab countries on the latest developments of the crisis over
U.N. arms inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
According to an official statement issued Monday, Demirel
stressed that it is the responsibility of all the regional
countries to reduce the tension.
</P>
<P>
He conferred with Omani Sultan Qaboos Bin Said and President of
the United Arab Emirates Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said an attack on Iraq by the United States will cause
grave consequences, and that Turkey, as Iraq's neighbor, will
suffer most.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has said that it has suffered a loss of about 35 billion
U.S. dollars due to the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq by the
United Nations in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish president stressed that Baghdad must comply with
the U.N. resolutions and that Iraq's territorial integrity should
be maintained.
</P>
<P>
Demirel added that he would continue to consult with the
leaders of the two countries on the Iraq crisis.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Demirel exchanged views with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak by phone, expressing Turkey's concern over a
possible U.S. attack on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has said that it will take military actions to force
Iraq to grant full and unfettered access to arms inspections.

<HEADLINE> UK's Rights Bill not to Curb Press, Says Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The introduction of a new human
rights bill to guarantee privacy would not curb press, a
government minister said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, said in the parliament: "I hope
and believe that an amendment along these lines will deal
satisfactorily with the concerns of the press."
</P>
<P>
Newspapers have worried that introducing a human right bill to
protect privacy could lead to judges creating a back-door privacy
law in Britain, allowing the rich and powerful to block stories
about their private lives.
</P>
<P>
One of the bill's provision says: "Everyone has the right to
respect for his private and family life, his home and his
correspondence."
</P>
<P>
Straw said he had reached a compromise understanding with Lord
Wakeham, chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, which would
safeguard press interests.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed fears expressed by some British churches that the
Convention could force them to act against their beliefs.
</P>
<P>
"It could not be used to require the Churches to conduct
marriages between homosexual couples or divorcees," Straw said.

<HEADLINE> Most Canadians Back Kyoto Accord, Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Almost nine out of ten
Canadians support the international agreement on global warming
signed in Kyoto, Japan, at the end of last year, according to a
poll published Monday.
</P>
<P>
Only six percent indicate the accord goes too far and will harm
Canadian industries and jobs, the Angus Reid poll has found.
</P>
<P>
When it signed, Canada committed to cut greenhouse gas emission
by six percent below 1990 levels by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Since Canada's emissions have increased by 13 percent since
1990, the total reduction in emissions will be closer to 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the Kyoto accord includes several "flexibility"
measures that will make it easier to reach the target without
actually reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse
gases, environmentalists argued.
</P>
<P>
The poll found that 42 percent of Canadians say it does not go
far enough, while 46 percent indicated it is about right.
</P>
<P>
The telephone survey of 1,510 people was conducted between Jan.
26 and Feb. 2 and is considered accurate to within 2.5 percentage
points 19 times out 20.

<P>
BAGHDAD, February 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan will send his special envoy, Algerian outstanding diplomat
Lakhdar Ibrahimi to visit Baghdad soon, according to reliable
diplomatic sources.
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic sources said Monday that Ibrahimi's visit is
aimed at paving way for Annan's planned trip to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
It was said that under the invitation of Kofi Annan, the
Algerian diplomat had participated Annan's two meetings with the
representatives of five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council last week to discuss means of defusing the crisis between
Iraq and the U.N. over arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
Annan will reportedly hold the third meeting Monday night with
the five permanent members of the Security Council to continue
discussions on diplomatic efforts that should be made to settle
the current crisis peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahimi paid a visit to Baghdad last November as Annan's
special envoy after Iraq expelled American arms inspectors on the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) charged of eliminating Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> EU Finance Ministers Discuss Asia Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Asia's financial crisis
became the key topic at the one-day meeting of European Union (EU)
finance ministers held in Brussels today as an Indonesian currency
proposal threatened to reignite the region's crisis.
</P>
<P>
Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), Monday attended the finance ministers'
meeting at the EU's invitation.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministers maintained that the lingering Asian
crisis would have a limited impact on their economy, saying that
they would go ahead with the economic and monetary union (EMU) as
planned.
</P>
<P>
Yves-Thibault de Silguy, EU commissioner responsible for
monetary affairs, told reporters that Indonesia was the only Asian
country in which the situation was not clear now.
</P>
<P>
He added the EU believed the most difficult part of Asia's
crisis was now "behind us."
</P>
<P>
Indonesia seems determined to press ahead with a proposal for a
fixed exchange rate system locking the rupiah into the U.S. dollar
in spite of the possibility that it could undermine a bailout
package of 43 billion dollars put together by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Camdessus, who met the EU finance ministers at their lunch
in Brussels, is firmly opposed to the risky proposal.
</P>
<P>
British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown said the EU
had to ensure that the economic reforms in Asia would bring
stability which was necessary at this time.
</P>
<P>
"We have to be vigilant," he said, but added that some of the
indications from commentators had been exaggerated. His views
were reportedly shared by some of the ministers.
</P>
<P>
The ministers Monday held their first debate on the annual
broad economic policy guidelines which the EU's executive body,
the European Commission, must present to EU leaders by a June
summit in Cardiff, Wales.
