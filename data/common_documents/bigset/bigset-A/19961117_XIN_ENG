CAIRO, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are business
briefs from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- Kuwait and Poland today signed an agreement on
avoiding dual taxation, income tax and tax evasion in an effort to
promote economic cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Kuwaiti Finance Undersecretary
Abdel Mohsen Yusef Al-Hneif and visiting Polish Foreign Economic
Cooperation Undersecretary Jan Chatadaj.
</P>
<P>
The agreement stipulates that any construction project is a
permanent project if it exceeds a period of six months which would
enjoy favorable tax payments.
</P>
<P>
It also exempts public institutions from revenue and interest
taxes, while a 50 percent tax would be imposed on private
ventures.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Bread prices will be reduced in Turkey next week as
the government has solved controversy with bakery owners.
</P>
<P>
The bread prices will be reduced to 15,000 Turkish Liras (0.15
U.S. dollars) from 18,000 TL (0.18 dollars) as part of the
economic program intended to benefit low-wage earners, who provide
the bulk of support for Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan's party.
</P>
<P>
The government failed to implement the price reduction Friday
as was announced by Erbakan earlier, because bakery owners
complained that it was unaffordable.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran announced today that it has bought a new
submarine from Russia, the third of the kind since 1992.

stopping short elaborating the deal.
</P>
<P>
A foreign military specialist told Xinhua that the deal is
estimated at 130 million U.S. dollars.

Russia had delivered two Kilo-class submarines to the Iranian
Navy. The first one was delivered 1992 and the second in 1993, at
the prices of 100 million and 115 million dollars
respectively. They are now based in southern Persian Gulf.
</P>

<P>
HARARE, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe will next week host
two four-day regional seminars for southern Africa to help the
states within the sub-Saharan region to incorporate environmental
concerns better into macro-economic and sectoral policy reforms.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the World Bank said today the seminars on
''promoting growth with equity and environmental
sustainability,'' would help improve functional cooperation for
sustainable development initiatives among different key sectors
in countries within the region.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the program will be at ministerial level and
senior government officials, journalists and representatives of
sustainable development, non-governmental organizations and
international development agencies.
</P>
<P>
The seminars' objectives are to better understand the
interactions of population pressure, agricultural intensification
and environmental degradation in relation to terrestrial and
aquatic bio-diversity, environmental laws and regulations,
economic incentives, and social participation.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank said widespread poverty was closely linked to
environmental degradation, as rapid population growth and limited
economic opportunities combine to put increasing population
pressure on natural resources.

<HEADLINE> Local Authorities in Serbia Hold Run-off Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Run-off elections for local
authorities in the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia will be held
Sunday, in which voters will choose between two candidates with
the biggest number of votes in the first round in each district.
</P>
<P>
In the first round held on November 3, only 2,067 candidates
were elected for the 7,670 seats in 188 municipal districts in
Serbia, excluding capital city Belgrade. The rest seats will be
elected in Sunday's run-off elections.
</P>
<P>
The largest number of seats were obtained by ruling Socialist
Party of Serbia (SPS) with 1,227 seats, followed by the opposition
coalition Zajedno (Together) with 313 and Yugoslav left (JUL) with
111.
</P>
<P>
Of the 110 seats in Belgrade assembly, only four were filled in
the first round -- three deputies of the SPS-JUL coalition and one
of the Serbian Radical Party.
</P>
<P>
On November 3, 60 percent of 7.5 million eligible voters cast
their ballots to elect their representatives for the Chamber of
Citizens of the Federal Parliament, as well as their deputies for
the local political bodies. The ruling leftist coalition,
comprised of SPS, JUL and the New Democratic Party, had won 64 out
of 138 seats in the federal parliament.
</P>
<P>
The results of the run-off elections will be made public by the
election commission 48 hours after the polling ends at the latest.
</P>
<P>
If two candidates get an equal (highest) number of votes in the
run-off elections in a district, polling will be repeated in one
week's time until one candidate finally wins.

more bodies today from the site of crash of Tuesday's mid-air
collision between a Saudi jumbo jet and a Kazakh Ll-76 plane in
India, the total number of bodies pulled out so far rose to 309.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Spanish Prime Ministers Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Both China and Spain have
expressed their satisfaction with the progress of bilateral
relations and hoped for advancing the good cooperative relations.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng and Spanish Prime Minister Jose Mari
Aznar, who are attending the ongoing World Food Summit, have
shared the view on bilateral relations in their meeting here
today.
</P>
<P>
Satisfactory achievements have been recorded in the friendly
cooperation between the two countries in many fields. Over the
past year, the heads of state of the two countries exchanged
visits, which, Li Peng said, have helped enhance mutual
understanding. Li Peng believes that the Sino-Spanish relations
would continue to advance in depth during the term of Aznar's
government.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin's Spain trip last june was quite
a success, Aznar said.
</P>
<P>
There are still potentials for furthering the economic links
and trade between the two countries and China takes a positive
attitude towards the economic cooperation, Li Peng said. China
welcomes Spanish firms to increase their direct investment in
China so as to increase its exports to China along with the
investment. However, Li Peng noted, China's economy is a socialist
market economy, in which Spanish entrepreneurs should raise their
competitives before they could hold shares of the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
China is a huge market and very attractive to Spanish firms,
Aznar said. Spain is interested in furthering the cooperation
between the two countries in political, economic, and scientific
and technological fields. The two governments should take further
efforts to push forward the cooperation, Aznar said, adding that
Spain already investment projects in China in telecommunications
and hydro-electric sectors.
</P>
<P>
The two Prime Ministers also agreed that tourism should become
one of the sectors in which the two countries can cooperate.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Some fish species in the Rift
Valley lakes are endangered because of uncontrolled fishing, the
Ethiopian News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Laleto Sodere, a senior fishery expert at the
Agricultural Bureau of the South Ethiopia Regional State, as saying

Only 600 tons of Nile-perch is presently caught annually from the
Awassa Lake which used to give 1,000 tons earlier, Laleto said.
</P>
<P>
According to Laleto, a study on the fishery resources of the lakes
is underway and the findings will be forwarded to the pertinent
authorities for the formulation of regulations to save the endangered
species and for the proper utilization of fishery resources of the
Rift Valley lakes.
</P>
<P>
More than 11,000 tons of fish can be produced from the Awassa,
Chamo and Abaya lakes every year. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The Society of British
Aerospace Companies (SBAC) has signed a Memorandum of
Understanding with the Aviation Industries of China (AVIC) on
forming a Sino-UK Aerospace Equipment Working Group, SBAC
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement to form the working group is aimed to promote and
evaluate the commercial and technical co-operation between the two
industries, primarily in civil aviation.
</P>
<P>
The working group will consist of senior business executives
from both countries and it will be balanced in both numbers and
technical expertise.
</P>
<P>
The major objective of the agreement is to facilitate joint
venture partnerships between supply chain equipment manufacturers
and suppliers from Britain and their counterparts in the Chinese
aerospace industry.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, SBAC said the agreement presents major
opportunities to Britain's aerospace equipment companies to meet
with their Chinese partners on the 100 seat jet program.
</P>
<P>
The experience of UK companies in all facets of supply chain
management will enhance the rapidly growing Chinese aviation
industry as it seeks to assert itself in both regional and long
haul aircraft markets, it added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a Sino-UK Joint Commission was set up and
its main purpose is to promote closer ties between the chemical,
power and aerospace industries of China and Britain.

<HEADLINE> Investigation of Egyptian Boat Mishap Underway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November (Xinhua) -- Egyptian prosecution authority
today ordered the formation of a technical committee to look into
the shipwreck of an ill-fated boat, while rescue teams are
still searching for 20 missing persons aboard.
</P>
<P>
Twenty people aboard the cruiser were feared drowned when the
boat ran aground and sank on Thursday night during a Nile cruise
between Luxor and Aswan, a popular route for tourists visiting
Egypt's pharaonic antiquities.
</P>
<P>
The ship was carrying 128 people when storms hit it near Edfu,
about 600 kilometers south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
By Friday night, police, rescue workers and villagers had
evacuated 53 Czechs, 45 Egyptians and 10 Slovaks. Three Egyptians
thought dead survived and swam to shore Thursday. The bodies of
four foreign tourists and an Egyptian have been recovered.
</P>
<P>
The winds grounded the boat, tilting it on its left side. The
ship sank with only three meters of its body rising above water
level and some 300 meters from the nearest river bank.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution requested a report from the meteorological
authority on the weather conditions at the time of the accident.
</P>
<P>
Testifying before the prosecution, the ship's captain Mohamed
Tewfik Main, 35, said the trip ran normally till the ship reached
Edfu.
</P>
<P>
The weather changed suddenly 15 minutes after it set sail
from Edfu and exposed it to a fierce storm and heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
He lost control of the vessel, which was buffeted by the storm
till it ran aground and sank on one of its sides, he added.
</P>
<P>
The local prosecution also heard testimonies of some members of
the ship's crew and the tourists rescued from the accident.
</P>
<P>
The popular Nile cruises were suspended for three years after
Moslem militants began targeting them in their campaign against
the government. They were resumed last year.

<HEADLINE> Iran to File Lawsuit Against Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Iran's hardline Parliament
Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri said today that Iran will file a
lawsuit against the German government for providing chemical
weapons to Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
Nateq-Nouri said that Germany was responsible for the massacre
of Kurdish people in Halabja in 1988 while delivering a speech at
the Independence Stadium in the city of Sanandaj, the capital of
the Kurdestan province, 525 kilometers west of Tehran,
</P>
<P>
"We have known all along that the German government was an
accomplice of Baghdad, but today we break silence and tell the
world that Germany provided Iraqi regime with chemical bombs to
create a tragedy like Halabja," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war, Iran accused Iraq of
using chemical weapons to attack the border village of Halabja
in 1988, killing an estimated number of 5,000 Kurds.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran kept silence over the German's supply of
chemical weapon to Iraq for eight years. It now broke the silence
as German accused the Iranian government of getting involved in
the killing of four members of Iran's Kurdish opposition in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
The German Federal Prosecutor's office issued an arrest
warrant for Iranian Information Minister Ali Fallahiyan for
issuing the order to kill the four members in Germany.
</P>
<P>
After the four members of Iran's Kurdish opposition were found
murdered in a Berlin restaurant in 1992, the relations between
Iran and Germany has gone through periodic crises.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, German prosecutors sought life sentences for
Iranian Kassem Darabi and Lebanese Abbas Rhayel who were charged for
murdering four Iranian Kurds.
</P>
<P>
Observers here say that the issue will undoubtedly affect the
good relations between the two countries. However, they ruled out
the possibility of a full-scale war of words between Tehran and
Bonn, because of extensive multi-billion dollar commercial links.
</P>
<P>
An informed source told Xinhua that there was a tacit
agreement between Iran and Germany that Bonn would no longer
talk of Iranian involvement in the killing of four Kurds in
exchange for the release of a German national accused of spying
on Iran.
</P>
<P>
On July 1, 1994, German national Helmut Szimkus, who was
sentenced to death by an Iranian court on charges of spying for
Iraq, was released by Iranian authorities after appeals by
German Chancellor Kohl and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel.

<HEADLINE> 200,000 Refugees Cross Rwanda Border: UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 16 (Xinhua) -- About 200,000 Hutu refugees
have crossed into Rwanda from Zaire since an exodus began on
Friday, an official from the U.N. High Commission for Refugees
(UNHCR) said today.
</P>
<P>
"We estimate that up till this morning up to 200,000 had
already crossed since this started yesterday," UNHCR spokesman
Ray Wilkinson said, quoted in a report from Gisenyi, a Rwandan
border town.
</P>
<P>
He noted that 15,000 people are crossing every hour, and
a further 300,000 are waiting to cross.
</P>
<P>
So far about one-third of the 1.1 million refugees in eastern
Zaire are crossing or waiting to cross the border back to Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
This happened when the U.N. Security Council gave its formal
endorsement to the U.N.-backed multinational force late on friday
and the first contingents could be on the ground within days.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda said the force is obsolete before it has even been
deployed because of the dramatic change that began on Friday --
the mass return of hundreds of thousands of Rwandan Hutus who
have lived in Zaire as refugees since 1994.
</P>
<P>
However, U.N. special envoy for the Zaire crisis Raymond
Chretien returned to Rwanda today on a non-stop shuttle betweenn
regional capitals, saying the Canadian-led force is still needed.
</P>
<P>
"I want to talk to the president and vice-president of Rwanda
today," he said on arrival in the Rwandan capital of Kigali.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands more refugees are far to the south and
nothing is known about their condition or intentions.
</P>
<P>
"Everywhere i go they tell me only such a humanitarian
military presence can deal with the problem of refugees.
</P>
<P>
"Everywhere i have been told that if the force leaves in four
months and the refugees are still there it will have failed in
its mission,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody in the region wants to tackle this big issue of the
refugees otherwise forget about peace in the region."

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Rules Out Quick Resumption of Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister
Farez Boueiz ruled out here today a resumption of the peace
negotiations between Lebanon and Israel and between Syria and
Israel in a near future.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the prospect of the peace talks on the
Lebanese-Israeli and Syrian-Israeli tracks, which have been
deadlocked since February, the Lebanese foreign minister noted
that information coming from Washington did not produce optimism.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz's made the statement at a press conference he held
at the end of a meeting with Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri in the Beirut Governmental Palace.
</P>
<P>
"In light of the present frozen state, it is difficult to
activate the two tracks," the foreign minister told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Information coming from Washington is not optimistic
on the possibility of resuming the Syrian and Lebanese tracks
and we don't expect the resumption at present," he added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a Middle East economic conference which ended
in Cairo Thursday, Boueiz repeated Lebanon's position on refusing
to take part in multilateral talks as long as no tangible
progress is achieved in the bilateral negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He said that any regional or international conference on
the Middle East economy could not be successful as long as
a final settlement has not been found for the Arab-Israeli
conflict and as long as an essential progress is not made
in the bilateral peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said that the Cairo conference was similar to the
multilateral talks involving Israel and its Arab neighbors since
it was attended by a number of world parties and its aim
was "to delineate the economic order in the region."
</P>
<P>
"How can we sit and discuss economic, political, social and
other affairs with a party which launches daily bombardment at
south Lebanon, occupies a large part of our land and arrests
sons of out nation," the foreign minister asked rhetorically.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore this conference could not be virtually successful
outside the framework of a political understanding which should
be set up in advance," Boueiz underlined.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria boycotted not only the outgoing Cairo
gathering, but also two previous Middle East and North Africa
economic conference in Casablanca in 1994 and in Amman in
1995.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Activist Killed in Bomb Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 16 (Xinhua) -- A member of the Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas) was killed today when a bomb he was
preparing for a suicide attack exploded, Israel Radio quoted a
Palestinian security source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The source said that Mohamed Assas, 31, died outside his home
in a village near the West Bank town of Jenin.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Jenin Hospital said that Assas was released
from an Israeli jail three months ago. He had been imprisoned
for Hamas activities several times.
</P>
<P>
Hamas carried out a string of suicide bombing attacks in late
February and early March this year, which killed over 60 people
in Israel and largely caused the downfall of Israel's Labor-led
government in the May 29 elections.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Israeli authorities again sounded alarming bell
saying that fundamentalist organizations have planned to carry
out fresh terrorist attacks in Israel.

<HEADLINE> More Athenians Abandon City for Suburbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The movement of Athenians away
from the city center to other areas reached impressive rates over
the last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
According to a study carried out by the consumers' institute
(suburbs), there is an increasing trend of downtown dwellers changing
houses, moving from central Athens to the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
In 1980, INKA contacted 4,135 families that lived within the
limits of the municipality of Athens and then, in 1995, once again
recorded their areas of residency in order to find out whether they
were still at the same address or had changed houses and, if this
applied, the reasons behind their move.
</P>
<P>
It was discovered that 28.5 percent of those questioned had
remained in Athens, and the majority of them in the same houses.
but about one in five (20.3 percent) had moved to the posh
northern suburbs.
</P>
<P>
About one in 10 (9.5 percent) had moved to the wealthy suburbs
in southern Athens.
</P>
<P>
The remainder were divided between different areas in western
Athens suburbs.
</P>
<P>
The reasons for those who turned their back on Athens are
different, ranging from overcrowd to air pollution, but many
people have done so due to their increased income and they could
afford a change of residence.
</P>
<P>
It is obvious, INKA says, that changes in area of residence
were accompanied by increases in incomes as well as by a need to
increase social status and "show off".
</P>
<P>
INKA points out that for the majority, a change in the area of
residence automatically meant an increase in their expenses
because rent, home-buying, transportation and other charges went
up.

<HEADLINE> African Leaders call for Review of UN Action in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 16 (Xinhua) -- African leaders of the Great
Lakes region today called for a review of the east Zairean crisis
and its management, according to a Kenya News Agency report
tonight.
</P>
<P>
The report said Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi held a
meeting in Rome, Italy today with leaders of Uganda, Tanzania,
Eritrea and Rwanda on the crisis in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The leaders recalled that in their recent Nairobi summit they
urged the formation of a U.N.-led multinational neutral force to
facilitate the repatriation of over a million refugees in eastern
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the 15-member U.N. Security Council unanimously
approved the deployment of a Canadian-led multinational force
until March 31 to ensure food and medicine supplies to the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
The African leaders said they regretted that the mechanism
laid down by the Nairobi summit had not been complied with, due
to lack of consultation between the United Nations and African
leaders.
</P>
<P>
However, they said they are encouraged by the developments in
eastern Zaire where more than 300,000 Hutu refugees have been
returning to Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The African leaders appealed to the international community to
continue making available adequate food to the remaining stranded
refugees in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
They requested president Moi and OAU Secretary General Salim
Ahmed Salim to closely monitor the situation in the Great Lakes
region.
</P>
<P>
President Moi yesterday told the on-going World Food Summit
that he is surprised to learn about international intervention in
the east Zairean crisis without consultation the Nairobi summit
participants.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Nairobi summit earlier this month came out
with practical ideas on how to handle the crisis in eastern Zaire
to avoid a Somalia-like intervention.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Reiterates Determination to Achieve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat today reiterated the
determination of the Palestinian people to establish an
independent state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said the declaration of independence he made in
Algeria eight years ago was not a radio statement, but "a first
step and first foothold over the soil of Palestinian homeland
with Jerusalem as its capital."
</P>
<P>
Arafat's remarks were broadcast today on Palestinian
Television and Radio, as celebration continues for a third
consecutive day in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to mark the
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
On negotiations with Israel over the Israeli army's
redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron, Arafat accused
Israel of pursuing a policy of extremism and delay, so as to
undermine the existing peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said the Palestinians were ready to discuss some
practical security details, but every time the process started,
Israel would backtrack and push back to "square one."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are due to
resume talks on the Hebron redeployment Sunday, in another
effort to try to conclude an agreement between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Despite predictions that an agreement on Hebron could be
reached before the weekend, the two sides still have to
negotiate on the last-minute details of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The main stumbling blocks continued to be the right of "hot
pursuit of terrorists" into the Palestinian-ruled areas, required
by Israel, and the weaponry to be used by Palestinian policemen
in Hebron after the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Some of the outstanding issues were left to be dealt with in
an exchange of letters between Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
During the recent negotiations, Israel insisted on changes in
the security arrangements agreed to under the Oslo accords, in
light of the violent confrontations between Israel and
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in September.
</P>
<P>
During the confrontations, triggered off by Israel's opening
of a tunnel near the Al Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third largest shrine
in Jerusalem's Old City, more than 70 people were killed,
including 15 Israeli soldiers, and hundreds of others wounded.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinians stressed that they would not
agree to renegotiate the existing agreement, saying otherwise
the whole peace process would be destroyed.

<HEADLINE> Zim-Zambia Oil Pipeline Underway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Ambitious plans are
underway to lay a pipeline from Zimbabwe to Zambia through which
crude oil will be pumped to the latter, a move likely to affect
the Tanzania-Zambia pipeline company (Tazama) Limited.
</P>
<P>
Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Energy and Water in
Zambia Romance C. Sampa told the official Daily News here today
that preliminary studies for the project have been completed and
comprehensive ones are in the process.
</P>
<P>
Sampa, who doubles as Board Chairman of TAZAMA pipelines, said
the project is being undertaken by BP and the Zambia government,
which has no objection provided the venture proves to be the least
cost option for the benefit of the Zambian people.
</P>
<P>
He said, "the government is not investing anything. Its task
is to create an enabling environment for investors and BP and
have their money put up for the project. If the project is proved
to be a least cost one, we have no quarrel."
</P>
<P>
The Zambian senior official said Zimbabwe has been receiving
crude through a pipeline from Beira, Mozamibque to Mutare,
Zimbabwe since 1983.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Zambia will continue relying on getting its
crude oil from Dar es Salaam through TAZAMA pipeline to the Ndola
refinery.
</P>
<P>
He strongly urged TAZAMA pipeline workers to work hard for
their survival in the light of the global free market economy
under which projects like laying a pipeline for white products
from Zimbabwe to Zambia are in the making.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia official pointed out that TAZAMA pipeline has of
recent past had two major setbacks - break down of the Ndola
refinery and single point mooring (Y piece) in Dar es Salaam -
which caused immense financial losses.
</P>
<P>
He said a catalyst unit at the refinery broke down in July,
forcing a shut down of the plant and a new one was imported. It
was fitted in August and a few days later the Y piece in Dar es
Salaam broke down, resulting into TAZAMA having no crude oil to
pump to Zambia.
</P>
<P>
"TAZAMA generates revenue through pumping crude oil. If there
is no crude oil to pump, then there is no revenue," he added.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Clinches Large Tourist Deal at MENA III </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Minister of Tourism
Mamdouh el-Beltagui said today the third Middle East and North
Africa economic conference (MENA Three) has succeeded in
attracting international investments in the field of tourism in
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the agreement on participating in the
Wadil-Gemal project on the Red sea is considered one of the
largest tourist ventures in Egypt, with investment totaling one
billion Egyptian pounds (about 300,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The project is one of three ventures presented by the Egyptian
Ministry of Tourism among 188 projects submitted by Egypt during
the conference.
</P>
<P>
The Wadil-Gemal project will be carried out 40 kilometers south
of Marsa Alam on the Red Sea coast, covering an area of 1200
feddans (5,040 hectares), Beltagui said.
</P>
<P>
The project includes tourist hotels and villages of four and
five stars with a total capacity of 8,000 new rooms, he added.
</P>
<P>
The conference has succeeded in getting businessmen from
various countries acquainted with potentials and opportunities of
investment in Egypt and the Middle East in the various fields, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also hailed the role of the Egyptian private sector in
participating in the development process in Egypt, especially in
the field of tourism.
</P>
<P>
The private sector made a strong representation at the Cairo
conference, which hosted 2,600 business participants from some 90
countries and regions and 52 business international
organizations.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Welcomes US Decision to Grant Amman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Jordan welcomed here today
U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision on accepting the kingdom
as a major non-North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ally of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Information Marwan Muasher said such an decision
would enable Jordan to modernize its armed forces in a way which
was not possible before.
</P>
<P>
He added that the U.S. decision reflected the importance of
Jordan, especially in the drive of achieving peace in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The new status would make Jordan eligible for priority
consideration for the transfer of excess defense articles, the
use of already appropriated military assistance funds for
procurement through commercial leases, the stockpiling of
U.S. military material and the purchase of depleted uranium
munitions.
</P>
<P>
A non-NATO ally status would also allow for the positioning
of U.S. military equipment in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, a senior government official said that Jordan and
the United States have not discussed the positioning of
U.S. weapons in the country.
</P>
<P>
A press release by the United States Information Service said
the status also facilitated bilateral military training and
permited Jordanian companies to bid for certain contracts of the
U.S. Department of Defense.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and the U.S. had undertaken several joint military
exercises this year. And Joran, for the first time, hosted the
U.S. aircrafts which flew on surveillance missions in the no-fly
zone in the south of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Amman also hosted 16 F-16 fighters from Washington earlier
this year as a reward to its peace-making efforts in the region.
</P>
<P>
The new U.S. move was widely believed here as the formal
recognition of Jordan by Washington as a major partner in
U.S. "strategic landscape" in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
An expert, who asked not to be named, told Xinhua that the
U.S. decision to name Jordan as its major non-NATO ally
indicated the completion of the formation of the U.S. Middle East
"strategic triangle", which groups Jordan, Israel and Turkey.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Urges MENA Countries to Rechannel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 16 (Xinhua) -- A World Bank ranking official
emphasized today that more sufficient use of the human resources
in the Middle East region can spare it the need to ask for foreign
aid.
</P>
<P>
The region need not to procure loans or aid from the advanced
countries if rationalization is applied in the sectors of health,
education and social insurance, according to Jacques Baudouy,
chief of the Human Resources Division for the Middle East and
North Africa (MENA) region in the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
"They do need to re-channel these resources and secure their
efficient use," he underlined in an interview with the Egyptian
Middle East News Agency in Washington today.
</P>
<P>
MENA countries distribute higher percentage of their gross
domestic product (GDP) to education and health than medium-income
countries, but the standard of their services remain low,
according to the official.
</P>
<P>
They pump into the basic education 5.5 percent of their GDP
against less than 4 percent for the medium income bracket of
states, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In the health domain, expenditure differ considerably from one
state to another in the region, ranging from 3 percent of GDP in Yemen
to 8 percent in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Despite high expenditure, the educational and health services
have witnessed a marked regression after a big development in the
first five years of 1980s, due to sluggish economic growth in the
region, Baudouy said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to illiteracy as the most difficult problem in the
region, especially in Yemen, the countryside in Egypt, Morocco and
Saudi Arabia, the bank official said that "the only solution in
the long run is to stretch the basic education umbrella."
</P>
<P>
Over the outgoing fiscal year, the bank has been working
directly in Egypt, Algeria, Yemen, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and
Tunisia as well as the Palestinian Authority, the bank official
said.
</P>
<P>
Distributions to those countries in the field of human
resources reached 260 million U.S. dollars, about 20 percent of
the bank's total lending.

<P>
AMMAN, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Hussein stressed
here today the need to eliminate all obstacles that blocked
progress in the Middle East peace process, especially on the
Israeli-Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)
executive member Mohamoud Abbas, the king reiterated Jordan's
continuous support for the Palestinians to achieve their
legitimate rights on their national soil.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the King was briefed on the latest developments in
the Palestinian-Israeli talks regarding redeployment of Israeli
troops in the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Abbas, who is on an official visit to the kingdom, expressed
optimism about reaching agreement with Israel if the Jewish state
gives up its demand of so-called "hot pursuit of terrorists" in
the Palestinian self-ruled areas.
</P>
<P>
Israelis and the Palestinians had scheduled to conclude the
accord on Hebron, the last West Bank town still under Israel
control, during the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) economic
conference which concluded in Cairo Thursday, but postponed it due
to Tel Aviv's insistence on the security issue.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti, who was present
during the meeting, also held discussions in a separate meeting
with the visiting Palestinian official on the latest
developments regarding the Israeli redeployment in Hebron.

<HEADLINE> AL Chief: Peace Without Syria Inadequate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary
General Esmat Abdul-Meguid has said that peace without Syria will
not be adequate, nor will it be "the just and comprehensive peace
we cherish."
</P>
<P>
In an interview published today by the Syrian ruling party
organ Al Baath, the Arab League secretary general, referring to
the stalemated Middle East peace process and Syria's demands for
just and comprehensive peace, said the Syrian role was
fundamental and effective.
</P>
<P>
He said that Syria's stance had prompted the convocation of
Arab gatherings, the last of which was the Cairo Arab summit in
June.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the Israeli government led by Binyamin Netanyahu
for backing out from previously signed accords, Abdul-Meguid said
that such attitude was unacceptable and rejected.
</P>
<P>
He spelled out the necessity of channeling all Arab and
international efforts toward the establishment of just and
comprehensive peace.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League secretary general praised Syria's economic and
social achievements, which he said were positively reflected on
the firm Syrian stance in defending Arab rights.

<P>
SHANGHAI, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai wants to put itself
at an international level and to have as many as nine telephones
per thousand people by 1998.
</P>
<P>
The municipality now averages four phones per thousand people,
a big increase from two in 1994.
</P>
<P>
It has seen speedy development of its telecoms sector, with
total telephone exchange capacity expected to reach 4.5 million
lines by the end of the year.
</P>

Around one-third of Shanghai's families are expected to install
a phone this year, and the city will have more than 41,000
telephones for public use.
</P>
<P>
By 1998, the city will likely install as many as 70,000 public
phones, 12,000 of which will be pay phones or card phones.
</P>
<P>
In future, the municipality will give priority to installing
phones in new residential quarters and in suburban areas.

<HEADLINE> Iran Stages Anti-German Demonstration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Some 2,000 Iranian students
staged here today a demonstration to protest against German
provision of chemical weapons to Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
This is the second anti-German demonstration held this week
in the capital of Tehran. The last demonstration was held Friday.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration held in front of the German Embassy was also
in protest to German prosecutor's verdict in holding top Iranian
officials responsible for the killing of four Kurdish opposition
members in Germany in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by some professors and clergymen, the Iranian
students held anti-German placards and shouted anti-German
slogans, quite rare in the country as most of the Iranian
demonstrations are against the United States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 Iranian armed policemen are maintaining order
in front of the German Embassy, trying to prevent any violence
and clash from the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials have threatened that they would sue Bonn for
providing chemical weapons to Iraq, which were used against Iranian
soldiers during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Iran's hardline Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar
Nateq-Nouri said that Iran will file a lawsuit against the
German government for providing chemical weapons to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iran kept silence over German's supply of chemical weapon to
Iraq for eight years because of extensive multi-billion-dollar
commercial links between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
It now broke the silence as German accused the Iranian
government of involving in the killing of four members of Iran's
Kurdish opposition in Germany.

<HEADLINE> China Putting its Energy into Developing Marine Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- China is set to spend nearly
800 million yuan on marine technology over the next five years,
about half of that for research on ocean life, its environment,
and its resources, according to Chen Yingyi, director of the
Technology Department of the National Bureau of Oceanography.
</P>
<P>
"From 1996 to the year 2000, China will work for breakthroughs
in major areas of marine environment, sea water utilization, an
accurate survey of the continental shelf, utilization of marine
energy, and a comprehensive survey of the polar region and the
Nansha region in the southern part of the South China Sea," Chen
noted.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China will strive to develop advanced marine
technology, improve maritime services, and study development of a
maritime economy, which is the country's central task.
</P>
<P>
China's maritime economy has been developing rapidly since the
early 1980s and there has been a seven-fold increase in maritime
industry output over the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, the country has made some achievements in
offshore natural gas and oil development, marine biological
engineering, deep-water mining, acoustical technology, and
aquiculture.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it has learned to cultivate kelp, prawns, and
shellfish on a large scale, thanks to developments in genetic
engineering, and its output of marine cultivation is in first
place in the world.
</P>
<P>
Its techniques in offshore oil and natural gas exploration
allow it to drill faster and deeper with quality guaranteed, and
it has successfully developed a robot that can work at a depth of
6,000 meters.

For 74-year-old Jin Yangshan, pride comes from the neighbors,
the 17 households living in his building who have all been
recognized as a "good family". The building he lives in, located
on Heping's Nan Ying Men Street, is known city-wide for its many
good families.
</P>
<P>
A wooden plaque on the wall, announcing the "Voluntary Service
Board", is the first thing one notices upon entering the
building. Jin came up with the name to show the various types of
voluntary service that each household could provide, such as
repairing household appliances, baby sitting, and part-time
teaching. "We help others and others help us," Jin explains.
</P>
<P>
In the stairwell, up to the fifth floor, can be seen flowers
and 24 plaques proclaiming virtuous acts, some of them encouraging
people to help each other and to behave selflessly.
</P>
<P>
Jin asked two families who were not getting along very well
with each other to hang plaques on the wall together as a
demonstration of "cooperation". With Jin's encouragement, the two
families became friends again.
</P>
<P>
The stairwell used to be filled with a lot of litter, so each
family carted away the rubble and put flowerpots to make the
environment more pleasant.
</P>
<P>
Four other buildings in the community followed suit and
beautify their residential environment.

<HEADLINE> Public-Spirited Anecdotes From A Northern Chinese District (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, November 17 (Xinhua) -- She's known to everyone in the
neighborhood as "Auntie More" and has inspired more
public-spirited anecdotes in the well-known Heping District of
north China's largest port city.
</P>
<P>
The anecdotes that circulate in the downtown district of
Tianjin have served as the model for a nationwide socialist
ethical and cultural progress campaign.
</P>
<P>
The residents of the western Heping District describe that
their neighborhood community director, Auntie Shi, as one who is
always thinking up something - something she would do for the good
of the neighbors. Under her leadership, the neighborhood committee
has developed an immense local economy, which earned 550,000 yuan
(about 66,000 US dollars) last year, even though it began with a
meager money.
</P>
<P>
As the economy of her neighborhood community grew, Auntie began
doing good things for the neighbors, especially the elderly, such
as getting a public bathroom set up, as well as 40 coal bins, and
organizing regular medical check-ups and little outings.
</P>
<P>
She has sponsored a non-profit canteen to feed school children
at noon time, since their parents are busy at work and cannot look
after them. She has also helped 33 women who have lost their jobs
look for work in recent years.
</P>
<P>
One of them, Pang Yurong, could not afford to send her two
children to school, but with Shi's help, Pang started running a
teahouse, which became very popular.
</P>
<P>
When local residents ask Shi what she's thinking, she often
smiles and replies, "What else could I be thinking of? I'm only
thinking of how to help others excl."

People who have dedicated themselves to helping local residents
always seem to have pet phrases to describe what they do.
</P>
<P>
Gao Zhengshan, secretary of the district's Jiefangqiao Street
Communist Party Committee, is fond of saying, "Serve the people
not myself. Discipline myself first if others are to be
disciplined."
</P>
<P>
He works at least 12 hours every day, and doesn't stop on
holidays. This work overload has resulted in health problems, and
Gao's kidney stones have gotten worse, but he places priority on
his work.
</P>
<P>
Ma Shukun, director of the Heping Public Security Office, keeps
busy handling letters of complaint from the people. Last year, he
answered more than 300 such letters from people whose problems he
helped solve. Ma is fond of saying, "The time my folks are unhappy
about public order will be the day I'll resign," and so public
security conditions in the district are the best in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
In similar fashion, Wang Jiaogong, manager of a coal company,
always says he has to improve his work and do it better for
locals, and his love for people and enthusiasm for his work keep
him working hard to see that all people live a comfortable life
during winter.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Spy Suspect to Face Trial in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian prosecution will
issue an official charge sheet today or Monday against an Israeli
man and an Egyptian citizen accused of spying.
</P>
<P>
An Egyptian public prosecution source said Saturday the
prosecutor had questioned Azam Azam, an Israeli of Arab origin,
and Egyptian national Emad Eddin Abdul Hamid and would issue
charges detailing the accusation in the next three days.
</P>
<P>
Azam was held earlier this week on suspicion of recruiting the
Egyptian to spy for Israel's Mossad secret service, officials
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The government will also allow the Israeli Embassy to name an
Egyptian lawyer to defend Azam, a mechanic at the textile factory
Tefron, Egypt's Middle East News Agency said today.
</P>
<P>
Azam, a 35-year-old Israeli Arab, was seized last week outside
a Cairo hotel by about 10 men said to be Egyptian security
agents. The factory is owned jointly by Egypt and Israel.
</P>
<P>
His arrest has strained already tense relations between Egypt
and Israel, which insists he is not a spy and should be freed.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the first Arab country to establish diplomatic
relations with Israel. The Israeli government's intransigence in
Israeli-Arab peace talks has hindered the expansion of
Egyptian-Israeli ties.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak told an Israeli newspaper
Thursday that the Egyptian had admitted selling information to
Azam, who had been caught in Cairo with invisible ink and other
unspecified items, according to the local press.

Zhao Yongfu, 87, couldn't get rid of the pain caused by his
wife's death 11 years ago until he was comforted by psychological
counseling. Zhao said he felt that life without his wife had been
made easier than before, thanks to the help.
</P>
<P>
Zhao was only one of thousands of senior citizens living in
Heping District, who had gotten help from volunteer services in
getting through a difficult period late in life.
</P>
<P>
In order to help more than 79,000 people above the age of 60
lead more colorful and happy lives, the district government has
set up 15 schools for senior citizens and some 100 special groups
to provide psychological counselling.
</P>
<P>
"Chatting stations" are the most popular of these services. The
stations are staffed by psychologists and volunteers. Every day,
the elderly come to meet at the stations, while away the hours
chatting, and give advice and comfort to each other. Many
problems, especially psychological ones, get solved in this way.
</P>
<P>
The stations staff members also often visit people who are
bed-confined and those who cannot make it to the stations.
</P>
<P>
"The chatting stations have become a part of our everyday
lives," said one elderly woman, "I'll be lonely if I can't come
here some day."

BANGKOK, November 17 (Xinhua) -- When unofficial preliminary
vote count showed that the Democrat Party had snatched an equal
number of parliamentary seats as the New Aspiration Party,
Democrat Party leader Chuan Leekpai said he will still have a
chance to win the mandate to form the new government.
</P>
<P>
When the equal number of 124 seats for both parties appeared on
Television Channel 9 at about 21:15 local time (14:15 GMT),
hundreds of supporters at Chuan's home in the southern province of
Trang cheered excitedly.
</P>
<P>
About 20 minutes before, when the television showed that the
Democrats were three seats behind the New Aspiration Party, Chuan
conceded defeat.
</P>
<P>
Final official vote count is not yet ready.
</P>
<P>
If the final official count also shows that the two parties are
tied, the two parties will each try the best to win as many MPs as
possible to command a majority in the Lower House to gain the
mandate to form the new government.
</P>
<P>
The new house has 393 seats.

ISLAMABAD, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Seeded players all sailed
further into the second round as the World Squash Championship
reeled off in Karachi on Sunday.
</P>

British Del Harris, the sixth seed in the tournament, survived

15-13, 14-15, 12-15, 15-14.
</P>
<P>
After taking the first two sets, the Briton, 1995 runner-up,
was one point away from sealing the competition before the
Australian rallied back to win eight points in a row from 7-14 in
the third set.
</P>
<P>
Jenson levelled the score 2-2 as the Briton was still fumbling
at the court, shocked at the unbelievable loss of the third set.
</P>
<P>
However, Harris regained his form in the decider and survived
the protracted five-set competition to continue his journey in the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
"I lost my concentration in the third game and thought that I
had won," said Harris.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, seventh-seeded Simon Parke, former world
junior champion, defeated his British compatriot David Evans
15-11, 15-7, 15-13.
</P>

<P>
Except this minor breakthrough, the whole rescue work,
however, has been making slow progress, due of the lack of proper

victims.
</P>
<P>
For eight days, the searching of divers from the navy, police

Neither the fuselage nor any intact human body has been found.

<P>
CAIRO, November 17 (Xinhua) -- A Russian-made plane hired by
the Zairean government was forced to land at the Cairo
International Airport today after it broke into Egyptian airspace.
</P>
<P>
The airport control tower this morning detected the plane when
it entered Egyptian airspace. It was coming from Zaire en route
to Israel, with a crew of 10 on board.
</P>
<P>
The control tower ordered the pilot to land at the airport as
the plane had not obtained permission to enter Egypt's airspace
and therefore had broken civil aviation regulations.
</P>
<P>
A committee of the Civil Aviation Authority is investigating
the incident with the pilot. It appeared the plane was on its way
to Ben Gurion Airport in Israel.
</P>
<P>
In such cases, a fine is to be paid before the aircraft is
allowed to take off after getting permission to cross Egypt's
airspace.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Accelerate Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's caretaker
government is working hard to accelerate the process of
privatization in the country in a transparent manner, said a high
official here today.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Privatization Commission (PC) Salman Shah said
that to meet the objective the government has constituted a "Task
Force on Accelerated Privatization" to review the current
privatization agenda.
</P>
<P>
The task force headed by Salman Shah would hold its first
meeting Tuesday and put forth its recommendations for improvement
in the privatization process.
</P>
<P>
Salman was hopeful that all the recommendations would be
finalized at the first meeting of the task force, said local
reports.
</P>
<P>
The task force on privatization is one of the 11 task forces
set up by the caretaker government to carry out structural reforms
in key areas of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The commission would put up a list of projects before the task
force and see if its members can suggest improvements in the
privatization of state-owned units.
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to expedite the process as much as possible," said
the chairman.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to bring into the net of privatization all the
hidden assets which were continuing to burden the country's
economy," he said.  "The government would proceed in a systematic
and professional manner to transfer these assets into productive
assets and transform the economy into a healthy and vibrant one."
</P>
<P>
Advisor to the prime minister on finance and economic affairs
Shahid Javed Burki is expected to discuss the recommendations of
the 11 task forces on structural reforms with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) during the negotiations scheduled to start
next month in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Refugees Continue to Flow Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Rwandan refugees
kept flowing into Rwanda's Gisenyi area from Zaire this morning,
while an immense procession of refugees heading to the interior of
the country set off from the border town, Agence France Presse
(AFP) reported.
</P>
<P>
As the sun rose, the refugees who spent the night in make-do
tents in Gisenyi resumed their march by joining the huge human
tide surging forward, said AFP.
</P>
<P>
Most of the refugees would arrive at a transition center in
Nkamira, 21 kilometers from Gisenyi, where international
humanitarian organizations were distributing food and seeds for
planting in the field.
</P>
<P>
Some of them climbed hills outside Gisenyi as shortcuts to go
home.
</P>
<P>
So far at least 200,000 refugees have returned to Rwanda and
hundreds of thousands more are expected to cross the border in a
few days.
</P>
<P>
The French State Secretary for Emergency Humanitarian Action
Xavier Emmanuelli was flying to Kigali, capital of Rwanda, from
Chad this morning to begin a three-day tour to evaluate the
humanitarian situation in Rwanda and eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Gabonese President Omar Bongo today
met with his Zairean counterpart, Mobutu Sese Seko, in
southeastern France to discuss the new development of situation in
Zaire and the deployment of a multinational force in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Bongo was quoted as saying that it was now for Africans to
speak out on how to launch the humanitarian intervention in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The huge influx of refugees back home to Rwanda from Zaire has
seriously put into question the necessity of the deployment of a
multinational force, which was approved by the United Nations
Security Council Friday.
</P>
<P>
Fierce fighting between Zairean government troops and
Banyamulenge rebels in eastern Zaire forced Rwandan and Burundian
refugees to flee their camps in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan refugees, most of whom Hutus, hated to go back home
in fear of retaliation of the Tutsi-led government after the 1994
genocide.

<HEADLINE> PA Official: Differences Remain in Hebron Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 17 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian chief negotiator
to the Palestinian-Israeli talks said today that differences
between the two sides are still existing in a Hebron deal.
</P>
<P>
In an interview to local radio "Sawt al-Arab" this morning,
Saeb Erekat, also minister of local government in the Palestinian
Authority (PA) reaffirmed that Israel's sustained endeavors to
renegotiate the reached agreements will never succeed.
</P>
<P>
He called upon the Israeli government led by Binyamin Netanyahu
to implement the signed agreements, adding that this is the only
test before the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
If Netanyahu makes a political decision and orders the Israeli
negotiating team to deal with the agreements signed as they are,
there will be no obstacles to reach a mechanism for putting these
agreements into effect, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators returned to the bargaining
table Sunday after they failed in overnight talks Friday to break
an impasse over Israel's demand to allow its troops to enter
Palestinian areas in Hebron for hot pursuit of suspected
extremists.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli troop redeployment in 80 percent of the Hebron area
has been delayed following a series of suicide bomb attacks by
Islamic militants killing dozens of people in the Jewish state in
late February and early March, and since the hardline Netanyahu
took power in June.
</P>
<P>
Israel reportedly wants to alter the accord signed by the
previous labour government, demanding more security for some 400
Jewish settlers in heavily-guarded enclaves among 120,000
Palestinian residents in Hebron, the last West Bank town still
under Israeli control.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission and
United Nations believe that a lasting solution to the Somali
crisis will be determined by the Somalis themselves, the Kenyan
newspaper Sunday Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
The EC and UN representatives expressed the view on the Somali
crisis at an EC-sponsored three-day conference opened in the
Kenyan town of Nakuru yesterday.
</P>
<P>
This is the second seminar sponsored by the EC under the theme
"Decentralized political structure for Somalia; A Menu of
Options."
</P>
<P>
The Charge d'Affaires of the Dutch embassy, Arend Pieper, who
represented the acting presidency of the European Union said the
EU has adopted certain principles with regards to Somalia's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
"These are strict neutrality with respect to the fighting
factions, non-recognition of any government that is not broadly
represented and supporting initiatives by the UN and the
Organization of African Unity," Pieper specified.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Felix Mosha,the representative of the UN
Office for Somalia said, "The task of restructuring Somalia
belongs to the Somalis and we wholeheartedly support all efforts
that encourage dialogue among Somalis."
</P>
<P>
The topic of the seminar stems from a study conducted by
scholars at the London School of Economics on available options
of bringing and sustaining peace in strife-torn Somalia, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Thirty prominent Somali personalities selected on the basis of
their professional qualifications and experience are attending
the meeting.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, November 17 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to
produce 480 billion kg of grain this year, an increase of 13.5
billion kg over 1995, which will deal with the country's

<HEADLINE> Britain, Canada May Boycott CMAG Trip to Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The visit of the Commonwealth
Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) to Nigeria, scheduled for
November 19 and 20, may suffer a hitch as Britain and Canada are
unlikely to participate in the two-day trip.
</P>
<P>
The "Sunday Tribune" newspaper today reported by quoting
diplomatic sources that the foreign ministers of the two
countries, members of the six-seat CMAG, are not comfortable with
Nigeria's disagreement on a proposed fact-finding mission from
the CMAG.
</P>
<P>
The visit which has been postponed once when it was billed to
take place in August was then called off because Nigerian
officials refused to tolerate a fact-finding mission status for
the CMAG team.
</P>
<P>
According to Nigerian officials, it is not necessary for the
CMAG to have a fact-finding mission after the United Nations had
conducted one in April this year, which came up with a fair
review of the Nigerian situation.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria considers the UN team by far superior to the
Commonwealth effort, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The CMAG visit to Nigeria was decided during the talks between
the Commonwealth and Nigeria in London in June, as an effort to
continue dialogue between the two sides on improving relations
after Nigeria was suspended from the organization last November.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Nigeria has formed a 19-man
delegation for the talks. The delegation, led by Foreign Affairs
Minister Tom Ikimi, will meet before the arrival of the CMAG team
on Tuesday and is expected to review the situation and finalize
modalities for the CMAG visit and subsequent talks.
</P>
<P>
The CMAG team includes the foreign ministers of Zimbabwe,
Britain, Canada, Ghana, South Africa and New Zealand.

<HEADLINE> North China City To Lead In Using Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The largest industrial city in
north China, Tianjin, has led the country with 11.3 percent growth
in overseas investment this year and plans to attract 15 billion
US dollars in overseas investment over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
It is China's third biggest city and is first in north China in
attracting investment from the world's top 500 multinationals.
</P>
<P>
During the first three quarters, it added 841 foreign-funded
projects with overseas investment reaching 3.2 billion US dollars,
bringing the total number to more than 10,000, with more than 20
billion US dollars in investment.
</P>
<P>
Many multinationals, such as the US's Motorola, P&AMP;G and Otis,
Japan's Honda and Yamaha, and the ROK's Samsung, Hyundai and
Daewoo, each has invested more than 100 million US dollars in the
city.
</P>
<P>
Many companies there have focused on automobiles, electronics,
machinery, chemicals, metallurgy and textiles, with rapidly
increasing output and profits, encouraging further overseas
investment. Last year, they had more than 55 billion yuan in
output value and more than six billion yuan in pre-tax profits,
accounting for 35 percent and 47 percent of the local industrial
total, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The city is taking steps to make foreign-funded enterprises
into a major factor in the local economy by the turn of the
century, and increasing its status as an economic center for north
China.
</P>
<P>
It will speed up the building of a national materials market in
the city, providing means of production, personnel, technology,
and information. It will also increase use of overseas investment
in local infrastructure construction of ports, highways, bridges,
and telecommunications facilities.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the city will help overseas investors improve
their localization in the city, and speed up the move of local
industries which have been upgraded by overseas investment, to
inland parts of the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 17 (Xinhua) -- China's National Bureau of
Oceanography is pushing ahead cooperation with neighboring
countries in Yellow Sea ecology and environment.
</P>
<P>
The deputy director of the Internation Cooperation Department
of the National Bureau of Oceanography, Yu Yuancheng, says that
"the project is estimated at 20 million US dollars, but that is
just part of the extensive cooperation between China and other
countries in developing the marine economy, technology, and
controls in the next few years."
</P>
<P>
"We plan to increase cooperation with other countries to draw
more overseas investment and technicians, technology, and labor,"
Yu explained.
</P>
<P>
China plans to introduce crop cultivation techniques from
Spain, to be tried in shoals in the north of Jiangsu Province, and
advanced ocean monitoring technology from Sweden.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China has gone to the South Pole and has
studied the polymetallic nodules, and is quite active in studying
nearby oceans, and in attending many major global and regional
international conferences.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the 1970s, China has been cooperating
internationally in oceanography. Examples are the Sino-American
study at the mouth of the Yangtze River, and a Sino-French study
of the East China Sea. Chinese and American oceanographers have
also made some progress in forecasting in the "El Nino"
phenomenon, or rapid rises in temperature in tropical parts of the
Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
China has also attached importance to its cooperation with
developing countries. Since the establishment of the Chinese Study
Center of the International Ocean Institute, it has helped train
hundreds of personnel for Asian, African, and Latin American
countries, and has donated oceanographic research equipment to
them.
</P>
<P>
Some developing countries have imported complete sets of sea
water desalination equipment from China.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir Urges Developing Countries to Reject </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today urged developing nations to categorically
reject the move by the European Union (EU) to impose the
multilateral investment agreement on them.
</P>
<P>
The agreement which the EU proposed to raise at the World Trade
Organization (WTO) would only make the developing countries as
colonies of the West "which is what they (the EU) intend,"
Mahathir told a press conference at the Kuala Lumpur International
Airport upon his return from a 16-day official visit to Africa and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
"This idea about colonialization and world domination is still
entrenched in their mind. They still wish to dominate the whole
world," he said.
</P>
<P>
The WTO is scheduled to hold its meeting in Singapore next
month.
</P>
<P>
During his 16-day trip abroad, Mahathir was in Harare,
Zimbabwe, for the sixth summit of the Group of 15 (G-15)
developing nations. Then he flew to Guinea, a West African
nation, for a three-day visit followed by a trip to Ghana.
</P>
<P>
Before arriving at Kourou in French Guyana to witness the
launch of the second Malaysia East Asia Satellite (Measat-2), he
made a two-day working visit to Trinidad and Tobago, a Caribbean
island nation, and from Kourou, he flew to Paris and held talks
with French President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also visited the Lotus car plant in Norfolk, England.

<HEADLINE> Russia Still Central Europe's Major Trade Partner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia is still one of the
major trade partners of central Europe and trade between the two
sides registered a sharp recovery in recent years, a report of the
Czech Industry and Trade Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
Statistics in the report showed that in 1995, Russia's foreign
trade volume with the six central European countries -- the Czech
Republic, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia --
totaled 12 billion U.S. dollars, which represented an increase of
33 percent compared with the same period in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The 12-billion-dollar turnover, including nine billion dollars
worth of exports and three billion dollars worth of imports, took
a 12.7-percent share in Russia's total foreign trade volume in
1995. The figure in 1994 was 11.6 percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It added that oil and natural gas accounted for 67 percent of
Russia's total exports to these central European countries while
foods took a lion's share of Russia's imports from these
countries, accounting for 38 percent of its total imports from the
region in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Trade between Russia and central Europe suffered a slide-down
in early 1990s when the latter embraced Western countries,
particularly the United States, for trade. The situation was
reversed in 1994 when trade volume between Russia and central
Europe registered a first increase of 1.1 percent.

<P>
HONG KONG, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Urban Council
has rejected an appeal by AIDS concern groups and the government
to install condom vending machines in public toilets to encourage
people to practice safe sex.
</P>
<P>
Senior educating officer of AIDS Concern Graham Smith said on
Saturday that the Council refused to install the machines in male
lavatories because it feared it would encourage sex in toilets,
according to a local newspaper report today.
</P>
<P>
And he refused to recognize that there were about 10 male
toilets in Hong Kong which were notorious pick-up spots for
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
Urban Council Chairman Ronald Leung Ding-bong said that there
was no need to install vending machines in public toilets since
condoms are available at various kinds of shops like super-markets.
</P>
<P>
The issue was not on the agenda for discussion, he said.

NEW DELHI, November 17 (Xinhua) -- India's annual rate of
inflation declined marginally to 6.48 percent for the week ending

</P>
<P>
The inflation which shed 0.9 percentage points during the week
under review had stood at 8.6 percent during the corresponding
period last year.

The decline in inflation was attributed to lower prices of

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Iran Agree to Enhance Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Iran have
agreed to sign an agreement on investment guarantee and another on
avoidance of double-taxation to enhance cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Haji Ahmad Badawi said
today Iran's willingness to sign the two agreements showed that
they really want to enhance bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah returned home today from Teheran after attending a
meeting of the Malaysia-Iran Joint Commission.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which was to enable both countries to assess the
development in bilateral ties, has successfully identified areas
for mutual cooperation, Abdullah told reporters at the Kuala
Lumpur International Airport near here.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysian businessmen could take advantage of the
newly- launched train service between Abbas in southern Iran and
Asheghabad in Turkmenistan to penetrate markets in the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
He said Iran was interested in agriculture where Malaysia could
offer assistance such as in aquaculture.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said Iran also appreciated the Malaysian national oil
company Petronas' investment in its gas and petroleum industry in
spite of the policy of the United States on foreign investment in
Iran and Libya.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said the American policy had been opposed by the world
including the United Nations, the European Union, ASEAN and other
world bodies like G-77 and G-15.
</P>
<P>
He said apart from the bilateral ties, the two countries also
agreed that ASEAN enhanced its ties with the Economic Cooperation
Organization (ECO) made up of Iran, Turkey, Pakistan, Afghanistan
and six CIS states.

CANBERRA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government
should raise regional issues other than trade disputes during
talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton this week, Opposition
leader Kim Beazley said today.
</P>
<P>
Beazley said at the Nine Network's Sunday program that Prime
Minister John Howard should use his meeting with Clinton to stress
Australia's expertise and independent foreign policy in the Asia
Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
"What we ought to be saying to Clinton is our expertise on this
region, which is substantial, pointing out that we run an
independent foreign policy in this region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Opposition's trade spokesman Stephen Smith today
urged the government to raise the issue of a sensitive trade
tussle between Australia and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
He said thousands of jobs were at risk from the U.S. challenge
to Australian assistance programs for exporting companies, the
matter relates to the U.S. attempts to block an Australian company
from supplying leather upholstery to U.S. car manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton arrives in Australia next Tuesday. He will
meet Opposition leader Beazley, Governor-General William Deane and
hold official talks with Prime Minister Howard in Canberra on

<HEADLINE> Jordan Plans to Lower Bread Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has planned to cut bread
prices by 10 percent by the end of this year to alleviate the
negative effect of a price hike which sparked unrest in the south
of the kingdom last August.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Supply Muneer Suber announced Saturday that the
price of bread, the staple food for millions of poor Jordanians,
would likely to stand at 200 fils (about 28 U.S. cents) per kilo.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has bought 150,000 tonnes of U.S. wheat at a new global
market rate of 164 dollars a tonne, or 40 percent cheaper than
the prices six months ago. The shipment would reach Jordan by
1997 and serve four month's needs of grain for the country.
</P>
<P>
Jordan doubled the bread price in August with an aim to slash
subsidies, but promising a per capita cash compensation of 15
dinars (about 21 dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
However, the move, which the government said would make
Jordanians more independent and self-reliant, triggered the worst
riots in the south of the country since an unrest in 1989,
ignited also by a price hike.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein instructed the government last Wednesday to
"reconsider bread prices in Jordan beginning with the date that
the newly priced wheat reaches local consumers."
</P>
<P>
But he emphasized that any bread price reduction must not
affect the cash compensation announced in August.
</P>
<P>
Jordan relies heavily on grain imports as only 10 percent of
the approximately 700,000 tonnes wheat consumed annually is
produced locally.
</P>
<P>
Suber added that his ministry is seeking new wheat imports at
the lowest possible price.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Social Development Hamad Abu Jamus said Saturday
that his ministry has embarked on a two-stage program, with a
total cost of 1 million dinars (1.4 million dollars), to enable
impoverished farmers to grow wheat.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that the fund has already been allocated in
the form of grants or soft loans to commence wheat production.

<HEADLINE> New Method to Whiten Wood Pulp Found in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 17 (Xinhua) -- An environment-friendly
technique to whiten wood pulp has been developed and refined by
researchers of Haifa Technion university, in north Israel.
</P>
<P>
The researchers believe that the method, using enzymes and much
less chlorine than in conventional bleaching, will reduce
pollution of the environment.
</P>
<P>
The method is not more expensive than the use of large amounts
of chlorine and has been successfully tested in a large-scale
paper-mill trial, they said.
</P>
<P>
Cholorine aromatic compounds, a key chemical used in paper
making, are both toxic and carcinogenic -- a heavy polluter of
environment.
</P>
<P>
Laws in some countries have limited the amounts of chlorine
that may be used, thus forcing the paper companies to look for
alternative whiteners.
</P>
<P>
Most enzymes are active at neutral of acidic pH and at
relatively low temperatures (below 45 degrees Centigrade), but
conditions in paper mills are more extreme than these.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli researchers first isolated bacteria capable of
producing suitable enzymes, cultivated them in the lab, and
manufactured industrial quantities of them.
</P>
<P>
After five years of work, the researching team found the
enzymes can function under basic conditions and under
temperatures as high as 65 degrees Centigrade.
</P>
<P>
The technique is now being commercialized, and the researchers
believed the world's paper industry will soon use the enzymes to
minimize, and eventually eliminate, the use of chlorine for paper
bleaching, thus contributing to a better environment.

<HEADLINE> 2 Thai Parties Predicted as Top Winners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The first prediction of the
general election results after the polling ended at 3 p.m. today
shows that the New Aspiration Party and the Democrat Party will
emerge with the largest numbers of seats in parliament.
</P>
<P>
The prediction, made by the government-owned television channel
9, shows that each of the two above-mentioned parties is expected
to win 124 seats for the 393-seat Lower House.
</P>
<P>
If that is proved to be the case, it means that the number of
seats obtained by each party falls short of the minimum 197 seats
required to form a government and that the new government has to
be a coalition.
</P>
<P>
The New Aspiration Party is led by party leader Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh, who is caretaker deputy prime minister and defense
minister.
</P>
<P>
His party has a strong political base in the Northeast. Before
he became a politician, he was army commander-in-chief and acting
supreme commander.
</P>
<P>
The Democrat Party is led by outgoing opposition leader and
former prime minister Chuan Leekpai. He has been elected an MP 10
times. The party's political bastion is in the South.
</P>
<P>
According to the prediction, former prime minister Chatichai
Choonhavan's Chart Pattana (national development) Party comes
third, with 52 seats, while outgoing prime minister Banharn
Silpa-Archa's Chart Thai (Thai nation) Party comes fourth, with 35
seats.
</P>
<P>
The Social Action Party will win 19 seats, Prachakorn Thai
(Thai citizen) 15, Seritham (liberal democratic) 7, Solidarity 7,
Palang Dharma 6, Muan Chon (mass) 3, and Thai 1.
</P>
<P>
The medium and small parties could play a crucial role in
forming a coalition government.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Thailand's Polling in Good Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The polling today proceeded in
good order throughout Thailand, although some cases of suspected
violations of the election law have been reported.
</P>
<P>
At a Bangkok polling station in the Saphan Khwai area, Xinhua
correspondents saw two policemen and a few volunteers of
Pollwatch, a neutral election monitoring agency, were maintaining
order.
</P>
<P>
Voters standing in queues told Xinhua reporters that they
wanted honest, qualified and competent candidates elected to the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Some others expressed the hope that the new MPs will really
help control consumer prices as they had promised during their
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
Violations of the election law today included suspected
intimidation of voters, vote-buying and even firing. But the
police refused to give details before they have further
investigated.
</P>
<P>
The police deployed a total of 150,000 officers, including
border patrol police, to maintain order during the polling.
</P>
<P>
Of these, about 120,000 manned the 63,000 polling stations
throughout the country, and 16,400 formed rapid-deployment units
to intercept suspected vote-buying and other violators of the
election law.
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 officers worked in cooperation with Pollwatch
volunteers in all provinces to protect candidates.
</P>
<P>
Several thousand men in uniform were assigned to transport
ballot boxes after the voting ends.
</P>
<P>
Motorcycles, cars and motorboats were made stand by to deliver
ballot boxes to district centers.
</P>
<P>
In remote mountain areas, either helicopters or elephants would
be used to transport ballot boxes as other means are not
accessible.
</P>
<P>
There are 38.5 million eligible voters out of the country's 60
million population. They had cast their ballots at about 6,300
polling stations to elect a total of 393 MPs in the nation's 156
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen political parties fielded a total of 2,310 candidates
for the 393 seats.
</P>
<P>
The polling closed at 3 p.m. today and the official results are
expected to come out around midnight today.

<HEADLINE> New Method to Whiten Wood Pulp Found in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 17 (Xinhua) -- An environment-friendly
technique to whiten wood pulp has been developed and refined by
researchers of Haifa Technion university, in north Israel.
</P>
<P>
The researchers believe that the method, using enzymes and much
less chlorine than in conventional bleaching, will reduce
pollution of the environment.
</P>
<P>
The method is not more expensive than the use of large amounts
of chlorine and has been successfully tested in a large-scale
paper-mill trial, they said.
</P>
<P>
Cholorine aromatic compounds, a key chemical used in paper
making, are both toxic and carcinogenic -- a heavy polluter of
environment.
</P>
<P>
Laws in some countries have limited the amounts of chlorine
that may be used, thus forcing the paper companies to look for
alternative whiteners.
</P>
<P>
Most enzymes are active at neutral of acidic pH and at
relatively low temperatures (below 45 degrees Centigrade), but
conditions in paper mills are more extreme than these.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli researchers first isolated bacteria capable of
producing suitable enzymes, cultivated them in the lab, and
manufactured industrial quantities of them.
</P>
<P>
After five years of work, the researching team found the
enzymes can function under basic conditions and under
temperatures as high as 65 degrees Centigrade.
</P>
<P>
The technique is now being commercialized, and the researchers
believed the world's paper industry will soon use the enzymes to
minimize, and eventually eliminate, the use of chlorine for paper
bleaching, thus contributing to a better environment.

<HEADLINE> Israel Concerned Over Iran's Russian-Built Sub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The planned delivery next
week of the third Russian-built Kilo-class submarine to the
Iranian navy has raised concern among Israel's naval commanders
and intelligence officers, the Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted military officials as expressing the fear
that the deadly vessels could easily and quickly find their way
into the Mediterranean to aid Israel's enemies.
</P>
<P>
Iran is expected to receive the submarine on November 25, its
navy chief Rear Admiral Ali Shamkhani told reporters Saturday. The
arrival of the sub coincides with a week-long major military
maneuver involving over 10,000 servicemen. Over 100 vessels are
expected to participate, including the two Kilo-class submarines
delivered in 1992 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
"You don't build a submarine fleet for defense," one senior
intelligence officer said. "Submarines are used for disrupting sea
routes and attacking ships. They are a strategic threat to us
because 97 percent of our military supplies come via the sea."
</P>
<P>
The former Labor government, led by the late prime minister
Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, regarded Iran as a country posing
the most dangerous threat to Israel's existence, and the theory
formed the basis of its policy of peace with the Arabs. It seems,
however, that the Iranian issue has been watered down since the
Likud rose to power in the May elections. Prime minister Binyamin
Netanyahu apparently believes that Syria constitutes a more
immediate threat to Israel due to its proximity.

<HEADLINE> Urbanisation in Africa in Rapid Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Urbanisation in Africa is
growing at a rate well above six percent per annum, twice as fast
as that of Latin America and East Asia, a Zimbabwean expert said
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
With massive migrations from rural to urban centres, in
addition to natural growth within urban centres themselves, it is
expected that at the current rate, urban population in Africa is
likely to grow from 173 million in 1985 to 360 million by the
year 2000, said George Matovu, Senior Program Officer for the
World Bank-funded Municipal Development Program for Eastern and
Southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
He noted: ''The continuous political upheavals will lead to
large migrations within and across national borders with heavy
movements to urban centres.''
</P>
<P>
He complained of no adequate provisions for new urban
migrants, adding that the migrants have placed increasing strain
on existing government services.
</P>
<P>
''The diverse nature of the urban population also creates
sources of tension, and can lead to violence," Matovu added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Intimidated Thai Pollwatch Chief Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's general election
has taken another toll of the neutral election monitoring agency,
Pollwatch, when one of its provincial chiefs quitted on the eve of
election day.
</P>
<P>
Some Pollwatch volunteers in Nakhon Ratchasima, also known as
Korat, the largest province in northeast Thailand, today are
wearing black arm bands to "mourn" the resignation of Suchart
Chobpimai, Pollwatch chairman for the province.
</P>
<P>
Suchart resigned for fear of his life because he had been under
intimidation and had been accused of partiality.
</P>
<P>
In his resignation letter addressed to the governor of the
province, Suchart said that ever since he took up his post as head
of the poll watchdog body, he had been intimidated and frequently
followed by suspicious-looking people.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, two Pollwatch members in the province had resigned for
the same reason.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the event, Vice Chairman Vorachai Yongpittayapong
said that when Pollwatch volunteers did their job straight
forwardly, they were often intimidated.
</P>
<P>
He added that the volunteers witnessed several cases of open
vote buying in the province, but were unable to do anything to
stop the illegal practice because some police and local officials
refused to take action.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We (Pollwatch) hope that this dirtiest election would
be the last."
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, until Saturday, the Pollwatch reported a total of
4,260 cases of violations of the election law, against 3,521 cases
at the last election on July 2 last year.
</P>
<P>
Of the total violations, 1,970 cases were involved in
vote-buying and 340 cases in gift giving, with the remaining in
throwing parties to which voters were invited, making pledges,
buying identification cards, intimidation, and supplying
maintenance or construction services.
</P>
<P>
Another Pollwatch official said the actual number of cases
could be higher because in remote areas where there is no
telephone, complaints cannot be filed with the Pollwatch. Some
poor villagers who were just happy to sell their votes for a few
hundred baht (one US dollar equals 25 baht), would not report
vote-buying to any agency.
</P>
<P>
However, some violations had turned out to be false as campaign
canvassers deliberately made groundless reports against their
counterparts of other candidates just to smear their opponents.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Considers Management Take-over of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 17 (Xinhua) --The South African
Railways Authorities are contemplating a management take-over of
the key railways in the Southern African region, local press
reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen from the United Kingdom who had attended last
week's International Investors Forum here said a few days ago
that the South African Railways, Spoornet, has plans to see the
railways of the nearby countries change hands in management with
the participation in by more experienced South Africans.
</P>
<P>
They said South Africa had already taken over Zambia railways
passing through the rich copper mining belt to Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The Benguela railway joining Zambia and Angola will be the
next project for South Africa to take over, which will be
followed by the Tanzania-Zambia Rawilway Authority (TAZARA) and
the Beira corridor in Mozambique, the British businessmen said.
</P>
<P>
However, TAZARA officials said they had no idea about any
management take-over or buying of shares by South Africans.
</P>
<P>
TAZARA Acting managing director Method Kashonda said what he
knew of is the signing of an agreement between TAZARA and the
Spoornet last year which enables wagons of either Tanzania or
South Africa to enter in either country.
</P>
<P>
Botswana Railways, Zambia Railways and the National Railways
of Zimbabwe have each signed agreements with Spoornet, making it
easy for Tanzania or South African wagons to travel to Pretoria

for the elections in place.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by EC Chairman Judge Bobby Bwalya in an interview
with ''Sunday Times of Zambia'' here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
''All uncollected cards and all materials for use during the
elections have been sent to polling stations, as for those who did
not collect, they will find everything at the stations where they
registered,'' Bwealya said during his iterview.
</P>
<P>
The report also quoted police spokesman Francis Musondu as saying
that police are ready to take care of the situation in all polling
stations to ensure law and order. He stressed trouble makers will be
dealt with accordingly.
</P>
<P>
Musondu said that police preparations for the polls have been
boosted by purchase of more than 80 new vehicles from South Africa.
</P>
<P>
As part of the measures to ensure law and order, adequate
manpower, communication equipment and other logistics have been
already put in place, according to Musondu.

<HEADLINE> China's External Debt Suits Its Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 17 (Xinhua) -- China will neither heavily
reduce nor discontinue accruing external debt, officials from the
country's foreign exchange controller said in Beijing, according
to today's China Daily's Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted an official with the State Administration of
Foreign Exchange Control (SAFEC) as saying that the present growth
of external debt is reasonable in view of the country's payment
ability and economic demand.
</P>
<P>
Growth in external debt saw a remarkable decline this year,
according to SAFEC figures. By June, outstanding external debts
reached 109.57 billion U.S. Dollars, up only 6.3 per cent from the
same period last year. The whole year figure is expected to be
14.8 per cent.
</P>
<P>
"The annual payment of principal and interest, which is about
10 billion U.S. Dollars this year, is well within the country's
capability regarding the foreign currencies reserve," the official
said.
</P>
<P>
Debt ratio and debt service ratio, two major indicators of a
nation's payment ability, have been kept in a secure scope. In
1995, they were 69.9 per cent and 7.3 per cent respectively, far
behind the internationally recognized safety level of 100 per cent
and 20 per cent.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Project on Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Construction of the Three
Gorges Project, the world's largest water conservancy and
hydropower project, has been proceeding smoothly thus far with the
budget well under control, according to today's China Daily's
Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last September, capital construction investment
totaled 17.3 billion yuan and on-time availability of funds was
well beyond actual spending, hitting 18.6 billion yuan, said Li
Yongan, vice-president of the Three Gorges Project Development
Corp.
</P>
<P>
The capital funds come mainly from State investment, raised
primarily from nationally charged electricity fees, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the corporation was extended one million
U.S. Dollars in foreign exchange loans by the Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
The amount of funds also included loans by the State
Development Bank, which promised to provide three billion yuan
each year for consecutive 10 years.
</P>
<P>
All profits from Gezhouba Dam, currently China's biggest
hydropower station, have been constantly channeled to the Three
Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
Given such factors as changes in inflation, interest payment on
loans and foreign exchange rate, accumulated investment is
estimated to reach 203.4 billion yuan by the time the project is
completed in the year 2009.

<HEADLINE> "Nature" to Carry Picture of Sinosauropteryx </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 17 (Xinhua) -- A picture of a
Sinosauropteryx, believed by a senior Chinese geologist to be the
ancient ancestor of the bird, will appear in "Nature," a leading
international science magazine.
</P>
<P>
A fossil of the Sinosauropteryx was donated in August by a
farmer in northeast China's Liaoning Province to the Chinese
Geological Museum (CGM), during the 30th International Geological
Congress.
</P>
<P>
The fossilized creature looks like both a dinosaur and a bird,
as it has feathers, scales and a long tail.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ji Qiang, president of CGM, the largest geological museum
in Asia, named the creature "Sinosauropteryx." He held that the
creature, which is covered with feathers and therefore
warm-blooded, is the origin of the bird species.
</P>
<P>
Current textbooks say that the archaeopteryx, discovered in
Germany in the mid-19th century, is actually the genuine ancestor
of the bird.
</P>
<P>
Ji said that the fossilized Sinosauropteryx looks like a
"chicken killed in hot water." It appears to be convulsing, and
seemed to die miserably from the poisonous emissions of a volcanic
eruption.
</P>
<P>
Ji said the creature, which lived between 140-150 million years
ago, is about five to ten million years older than the
archaeopteryx.
</P>
<P>
However, some scientists insisted that based on the analysis of
its bone structure, Sinosauropteryx was not the ancestor of the
bird. It was a "warm-blooded dinosaur with feathers," they said.
</P>
<P>
The Sinosauropteryx has attracted widespread interest
throughout the world. Recently, the first life-sized picture of
Sinosauropteryx was completed by Liang Xiangrong, a painter at the
museum.
</P>
<P>
In the picture, the yellowish-brown Sinosauropteryx is covered
with feathers and has scales between its abdomen and tail, which
is 30 centimeters long, about three fifths of its entire length.
</P>
<P>
The creature's hind legs are long and strong, while its
forelegs are withered and short. Its red head looks like a
horse's, its eye and ear can be clearly seen from the side, and it
has sharp teeth. The Sinosauropteryx appears to be running or
seeking food. The background is blue marshland.
</P>
<P>
To accurately complete the picture, Liang followed Jiang's
suggestions, and consulted information on ancient creatures,
basing the skeleton of Sinosauropteryx. He also painted a black
and white sketch of the creature.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Political Crisis Deepens in Belarus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The political crisis on the
proposed amendments to the Belarussian Constitution has deepened
after President Alexander Lukashenko sacked Vikto Gonchar as the
chairman of the Central Electoral Commission on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A deputy director of the presidential office said Gonchar was
dismissed for his refusal to sign the results of the referendum
held on November 9. He accused Gonchar of trying to destabilize
the country and whipping up the anti-president waves.
</P>
<P>
The presidential decree signed on Thursday night for sacking
Gonchar was strongly opposed by Gonchar, the Constitutional Court
and the Supreme Soviet of Belarus.
</P>
<P>
In an immediate reaction to his dismissal, Gonchar said that
Lukashenko's decision violates the Constitution, according to
which only the Supreme Soviet has the power to decide his fate.
</P>
<P>
The government, in a bid to prevent Gonchar from going to
office, deployed police forces around the Central Electoral
Commission building on Friday.
</P>
<P>
But Gonchar, in a defying gesture, broke the police line and
entered the building together with Chairman of the Supreme Soviet
(parliament) Semyon Sharetsky, Prosecutor General Vasili Kapitan
and some lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
The opposition staged a rally nearby the building in the
evening, demanding for the withdrawal of the presidential decree
dismissing Gonchar.
</P>
<P>
The Constitutional Court ruled on Friday night that the
president's decision was "unconstitutional" and it was beyond his
power to issue such a decree.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Soviet has decided to convene an emergency session
on Monday to review the political situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The president, who has been engaged in a bitter dispute with
the Supreme Soviet over the amendments to the Constitution for
months, called on voters to support him on Friday night at a mass
rally in Mogilyov, northwestern Belarus.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the opposition might use the results of the
on-going referendum to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
Voting began on November 9 and will last until November
24. Voters should vote for Lukashenko's or the parliament's
version of the country's constitution.
</P>
<P>
The president wants to enlarge his powers by amending the
Constitution while a great number of parliament members intend to
reduce the president's duties.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Air Carrier Opens Beijing Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 17 (Xinhua) -- A subsidiary of a Taiwan-based
airline has opened a representative office in Beijing, confirmed a
Chinese civil aviation official, adding that it is both a natural
business expansion and a step toward preparing for direct air
links across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
China Airlines, a leading airline in Taiwan, opened a Beijing
office in June through its 100-percent owned CAL Asia Investment
Inc which is registered in the British Virgin Islands, today's
China Daily quotes Shen Shangqing from the Civil Aviation
Administration of China (CAAC) as saying.
</P>
<P>
CAL has "through check-in agreements" with the seven carriers
in China's inland areas, which allows CAL passengers to change
planes in Hong Kong without having to check-in again.
</P>
<P>
CAL has no direct flights with China's inland areas as all such
contacts are banned by the Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
"China and Britain reached an agreement in June on arrangements
to keep Taiwan Province's air link via Hong Kong with China's
inland areas as it is," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
Nothing directly resulting from the sovereignty transfer will
upset the normal business of other Taiwan-based airlines, Shen
promised.
</P>
<P>
Air travelers from Taiwan to inland areas hit an annual peak of
1.7 million in 1993 and Shen estimated that figure will range
between 1.5 million to 1.6 million this year.
</P>
<P>
In view of increasing civil aviation exchanges and the
possibility of direct air links being established in the near
future, another two Taiwan-based airlines are also planning to
establishing offices in China's inland areas.

<HEADLINE> Major Housing Policies Expected in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 17 (Xinhua) -- A package of policy proposals
pending final approval of the State Council should help stimulate
sales of commercially built housing, according to today's China
Daily's Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
The proposals will very likely result in a flurry of decrees to
be enacted, whose content should include fewer levies and
increased credit supply for property developers, and easier access
to mortgage loans for consumers, said Pan Qiyuan,
secretary-general of China Real Estate Association.
</P>
<P>
The move is believed to be a result of recent remarks by the
country's top policy-makers endorsing the idea that accelerated
property development will lend a strong impetus to the entire
national economy.
</P>
<P>
A boom in real estate development will have a trickle-down
effect on more than 30 closely related industries including steel,
cement and home appliances, said Hou Jie, minister of construction.
</P>
<P>
The anticipated government measures target affordable,
commercially built housing instead of luxury properties.
</P>
<P>
Each year on average, China spends about 200 billion yuan (24.1
billion US dollars) building residential housing, which barely
accounts for one percent of the country's annual consumer
expenditure and leaves great room for further expansion.
</P>
<P>
In the run-up to 2000, China plans to maintain 15 percent
annual average growth in residential housing construction.
</P>
<P>
For the goal, China will need to build new housing totalling
three billion square meters in floor space and demolish and
rebuild 2.9 billion square meters of old and dangerous housing.

<HEADLINE> India's Congress Party Leader Rules Out Mid-Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Former Indian prime minister
P.V. Narasimha Rao on Saturday ruled out any possibility of a
mid-term poll in the near future, chanting a tone different from
the past.
</P>
<P>
According to the Indian Express today, Rao, who used to remind
the ruling United Front of not taking the Congress party's support
for granted, made the remarks during a trip to his home
constituency in Andhra Pradesh where he was elected to the Lok
Sabha (lower house of parliament).
</P>
<P>
The Congress party's support is crucial for the minority
coalition government of the 14-party united front (the number of
constituents of the front have increased from 13 to 14).
</P>
<P>
Rao, who is now leader of the Congress party's parliamentary
party, told reporters that it had been proved that the Indian
people had the genius to run the government even if there was a
hung parliament.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he was satisfied with the performance of the
United Front government, Rao said "satisfaction is a relative term
but on the whole the United Front government was trying its best
to implement the program pursued by our (the previous Congress
party) government."
</P>
<P>
To another question as to whether the United Front government
would last its full five-year term, the former prime minister said
he found no reason why it would not.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believed that Rao's change of attitude towards
the United Front government is attributed to the recent power
struggle between him and Congress party interim president Sitaram
Kesri. The latter has recently repeatedly censured the United
Front government for its economic and diplomatic failures.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Expects Surplus Foodgrain Production: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Sher
Bahadur Deuba told the on-going world food summit in Rome, Italy,
that his country expects to produce surplus foodgrains in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
According to the official RSS news agency here today, Deuba,
while addressing the summit Saturday, said that with the increased
cooperation from the international community for implementing
Nepal's agriculture plan, the country would produce enough
foodgrains to feed its people in a few years.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has seen a decline in per capita food production in
recent years and the population growth in the past two decades has
transformed the country from a net food exporter into a marginal
importer, he said.
</P>
<P>
Deuba told the world food summit the Nepali government has
adopted a long term agriculture plan aimed at reversing the trend
by closely integrating it with a population control policy.
</P>
<P>
He said that food security in Nepal is closely linked with the
issue of poverty, which is featured by scattered incidence of
hunger and malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
Observing that international cooperation is a crucial element
for food security in developing countries, Deuba said Nepal is
concerned by the declining global trend of official development
assistance to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He called on the international community to play a key role to
assist the developing countries in fostering food security.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali prime minister arrived in Rome for the summit last
Wednesday after a four-day official visit to Britain.

<HEADLINE> Four Detained for Trying To Sell Black Boxes to Airlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Colombian police
have detained four people trying to sell the black boxes of a BC-9
airliner that crashed in January 1995 with 71 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
A RCN radio network report today said the detainees first asked
for 500 million pesos (500,000 U.S. dollars) from the owner of the
BC-9, and later lowered their demand to 100,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The plane owned and operated by the Intercontinental Aviation
Company crashed in the La Virgen swamp, of the Bolivar department
near the town of Marialabaja, nearly two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy, which killed 70 persons except a nine-year-old
girl aboard, took place five minutes after the plane's takeoff
from the Cartagena airport for a routine flight to San Andres.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the crash is still unclear.
</P>
<P>
Upon receiving the offer for the black boxes, the airlines
alerted Colombian authorities, which detained them when they were
ready to receive the agreed-on sum, added the source.
</P>
<P>
The RCN report did not mention when the arrest was made.

<HEADLINE> No Agitation on Streets Now: Bangladeshi Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist party (BNP) has decided that it would not go for a
massive street agitation against the government right now.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the opposition said that the decision was
taken here Saturday at a meeting of the National Executive
Committee of the BNP, whose lawmakers have boycotted the
parliament since last Sunday because of alleged unfair treatment
to the party by the ruling Awami League in the house.
</P>
<P>
But the main opposition party will prepare itself for the
massive agitation by consolidating its organizational strength
across the country and the meeting authorized its National
Standing Committee, the highest decision-making body of the party,
to finalize moderate agitation programs as a run up to massive
anti-government movement, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
In her winding up speech at the meeting, BNP chairperson Begum
Khaleda Zia made it clear that the party would not go for street
agitation now but would continue the agitation in parliament.
</P>
<P>
"We'll not return to parliament until our 10-point demand,
submitted to the speaker, is accepted by the treasury bench," she
was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Comptroller Charged With Drug Connections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Former Colombian
Defense Minister Fernando Botero has accused General Comptroller
David Turbay of involvement in drug trafficking, a charge he
pledges to back with evidence.
</P>
<P>
Botero made the accusation in a letter sent to the RCN radio
network from the military stockade where he has been a prisoner
since last August.
</P>
<P>
According to the former minister, "there is proof of Turbay's
connection with the Cali and Medellin drug cartels.
</P>
<P>
The comptroller, who is in charge of overseeing the state
expenditures, "has had relations with drug trafficking for many
years. There are lots of evidence showing Turbay is in a
permanent relationship with Pablo Escobar Gaviria, the Rodriguez
Orejuela brothers, Guillermo Ortiz Gaitan, and Pastor Perafan,"
added Botero.
</P>
<P>
Botero, who served as President Ernesto Samper's electoral
campaign general director in 1994, was sentenced to six months in
prison for the injection of millions of dollars from the Cali
cartel to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Botero alleged that in the second round of the presidential
campaign of 1994, Turbay requested financial resources from the
Cali cartel "to oil the liberal machinery on the Atlantic coast."
</P>
<P>
At that stage of the presidential election, according to
Botero, Turbay distributed money among liberal legislators and
organized the flights of the "narcoplane" to deliver the money in
several regions.
</P>
<P>
The former minister, who said early this year that President
Samper "did know of the drug traffickers' contributions to his
campaign," announced in his message to RCN that he had asked the
country's General Prosecutor to expand the investigation so as to
verify his charges against the comptroller.
</P>
<P>
"Turbay has used his power as the Comptroller against me since
the investigations of 1994 and 1995 arrived at the conclusion that
he was one of the fundamental political pieces for the Cali
cartel," he said.
</P>
<P>
The comptroller, in turn, is investigating alleged
irregularities in a contract of the Defense Ministry signed by
Botero in 1995 with a Swiss-U.S. business.

<HEADLINE> Dengue on Its Way Out from Indian Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 17 (Xinhua) -- No death has been attributed
to dengue fever in the Indian capital of New Delhi on Saturday and
the number of fresh cases reported at various city hospitals on
the same day has also come down to just about 20, the Indian
Express said today.
</P>
<P>
Last month an average of as many as 400 cases were reported on
a single day.
</P>
<P>
At least 375 lives have been lost during the three-month tenure
of the mosquito-transmitted disease in the capital.
</P>
<P>
As many as 8,910 people were hospitalized with complications
such as dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the virus is on its way out because the day
temperature has dropped considerably. This has checked the growth
of the virus carrier "aedes" mosquito, though local authorities
insist that their efforts to control the epidemic have finally
paid off.
</P>
<P>
The decline began around October 31 when the number of fresh
dengue cases came down to 175 with just six people succumbing to
the disease. By November 8, the figures had dropped to 76 and one
casualty, and by November 14, to 17 cases and four deaths and
finally to no casualty on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: General Election Begins in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Voters began arriving at
polling stations throughout Thailand shortly before 8 o'clock
today to cast their ballots to elect 393 members of the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, leader of the New Aspiration party, was
among the first to vote. He is widely believed to be one of the
two front contenders for Thailand's 22nd premiership.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit, together with his wife, cast his vote at 8:09 in the
northeastern province of Nakhon Phnom, a bastion of his party.
</P>
<P>
Thais consider nine a lucky number, which rhymes with the Thai
word for "forward".
</P>
<P>
The other favorite for the premiership is outgoing opposition
leader and leader of the Democrat party, Chuan Leekpai, who cast
his ballot in his home province of Trang, southern Thailand, at
8:39, with his mother, who is in her 80s.
</P>
<P>
Both Chavalit and Chuan declined to talk to reporters, as it
might be considered to be illegally campaigning during election.
</P>
<P>
Caretaker prime minister Banharn Silpa-Archa cast his vote at
about 9:29 in his home province of Suphan Buri, 100 kilometers
northwest of Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Banharn said after casting his ballot that the current polling
is important because the new parliament will be in session during
a period when a new constitution will be drafted.
</P>
<P>
He called for a high voter turnout and expected that the
turnout rate will be higher this time than the last election, on
July 2, 1995.
</P>
<P>
In BANGKOK, a 78-year-old man arrived at a polling station in
Huay Kwang district on a wheelchair. He was the first to cast
ballot at that station.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers arrived in various polling stations by trucks.
</P>
<P>
Voters in Bangkok's low-lying areas, in particular along the
Chao Phraya river, were among the earliest to arrive at polling
stations so as to avoid flooding and resulting traffic chaos.
</P>
<P>
High tides, worsened by heavy rains over the past few days,
have left some roads up to half a meter under water and created
traffic congestion's in low-lying streets.
</P>
<P>
Motorists have been urged not to use some roads during morning
and evening high tides today from 11 am to 2 PM.
</P>
<P>
At least 15 polling stations have been relocated to higher
places to avoid flooding.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok, which used to be the stronghold of the Palang Dharma
(virtue force) party, may now become a base for the Democrat
party, which is expected to sweep around 26 to 29 seats out of a
total of 37 for the capital.
</P>
<P>
In this election, the 19th general election in Thailand since
the country switched from absolute monarchy to constitutional
monarchy in 1932, 13 running political parties have fielded a
total of 2,310 candidates to contest the 393 seats in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Among the country's 60 million population, about 38.5 million
are eligible voters, of whom about 3.6 million are in Bangkok,
which has a population of about 6 million.
</P>
<P>
In an opinion poll released on Friday, jointly conducted by the
Bangkok Post and Ramkhamhaeng Independent Research Group, 66.18
percent of the respondents said they would vote today.
</P>
<P>
Among the non-voters, 54 percent said they were not going to
vote because they were bored with politics, and 11 percent said
there were no qualified candidates for them to choose.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry forecast that the voter turnout rate is
around 50 percent in Bangkok, and 65 percent nationwide.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- At least nine Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) rebels were killed Saturday in a fierce
firefight with a combined team of Philippine government troops and
Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) fighters in southern Basilan
province.
</P>
<P>
The fighting was the first joint operation of the government
troops and former MNLF rebels, who made peace with Manila in
September, against the MILF guerrillas, according to reports
reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, which did not participate in earlier peace talks
between the MNLF and the government, is one of several Muslim
rebel groups still fighting government troops. But the MILF,
currently the biggest anti-government force with a self-claimed
membership of 20,000, had agreed to hold talks with Manila.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the fighting occurred when about 25 MILF
guerrillas attacked the military and MNLF team in a village in
Tipo-Tipo town in the island province. Army troops backed by heavy
artillery were immediately sent to reinforce the team under
attack.
</P>
<P>
The casualties on the part of the MNLF and the army were not
known yet. So far, 110 government soldiers and MILF rebels have
been killed in the nearly one-month fighting between the two sides
in Basilan.

<P>
PARIS, November 16 (Xinhua) -- World champions Michelle Kwan
and Todd Eldredge chalked up the women's and men's singles laurels
at Lalique Trophy Figure Skating Championships on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It was the second victory of the season for Kwan after winning
the Skate America.
</P>
<P>
Kwan, of Torrance, California, completed six triple jumps but
wobbled on a two jumps and scaled down another.
</P>
<P>
Her routine to East Indian music still earned her marks mostly
in the 5.7- to-5.9 range on a scale up to 6.0.
</P>
<P>
Maria Butyrskaia of Russia was second, ahead of Tara Lipinski,
a 14-year-old girl from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Eldredge was a bit off from his top performance at the World
Championships in Edmonton when he used a brilliant routine to take
the world title.
</P>
<P>
He did seven triples but messed up one jump combination at the
start.
</P>
<P>
Second-placed Viacheslav Zagorodniuk of Ukraine and
third-placed Michael Weiss of the United States both did eight
triples but lacked the flair of Eldredge.
</P>
<P>
Elvis Stojko, the 1994 and 1995 world champion, was scheduled
to compete but had to withdraw Friday with food poisoning.
</P>
<P>
Oksana Kazakova and Artur Dmitriev of Russia moved from third to
first to win the pairs event. With an error-free routine and a
superior style than the other couples, they moved past Jenni Meno
and Todd Sand of the United States, who led after Friday's short
program. The U.S. duo had to settle for the second place.
</P>
<P>
Third went to another Russian pair, Elena Bereznaia and Anton
Sikharulidze.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Germany Attaches Importance to Relations With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 17 (Xinhua) -- President Roman Herzog said of
late that Germany attaches importance to developing political,
economic, technological and cultural relations with China.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Chinese journalists on the eve of his
upcoming China visit, scheduled for November 18-25, Herzog said
that he hopes his visit can contribute to the development of
German-Chinese relations in economy, science and technology, and
culture.
</P>
<P>
He noted that he is looking forward to the visit, the first by
a German president to China since Germany was reunified in 1990,
and his meetings with Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li
Peng.
</P>
<P>
One of his aims of the visit is to get a clear idea of how
China views its role in the future world and how it handles
problems popping up in its development, he said. He added that he
is very interested in finding out the ways China solves these
problems and in discussing the possibility of cooperation in this
respect.
</P>
<P>
He is going to China to get to know its political situation and
to see China's ancient culture, said the German president.
</P>
<P>
Herzog said that he once spent some time studying Chinese
history and has a great admiration for Chinese culture.
</P>
<P>
On current German-Chinese relations and prospects for future
development, he said China is one of the world's great powers and
will play an important role in the future.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Germany has great interest in having China,
a country in the process of rapid development, as an economic
partner.
</P>
<P>
China has made tremendous achievements in its economic
development, but at the same time faces many problems such as
environmental protection, and Germany has advanced technology in
dealing with these problems, said the president.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Germany and China have differences over some
issues, but neither should interfere in the other's internal
affairs. Nations should respect one another and refrain from
teaching others "lessons," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that nations should develop relations on the basis of
equality and mutual respect to guarantee world peace and social
development.

<HEADLINE> 87 Percent of Shanghai College Graduates Find Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 17 (Xinhua) -- More than 41,000 graduates
from 45 colleges and universities in Shanghai this year have found
jobs, accounting for 87 percent of the total figure.
</P>
<P>
Most students have entered into employment contacts with firms
and institutions in the city, but there are another 2,100 students
who are still seeking their first jobs.
</P>
<P>
Sources claim the figure shows this year's employment rate for
college graduates has rose slightly compared with last year.
</P>
<P>
The supply-demand ratio is 1:1.1 for students majoring in
engineering, sciences and medicine, 1:1.3 for arts, 1:1.5 for
normal education, and 1:1 for finance, economics, law and
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
But the demand ratio is higher at some noted universities,
including Fudan, Jiaotong and Tongji, in which 90 percent of their
graduates have signed contacts with employers.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute this to the quality of graduates from those
world famed universities.
</P>
<P>
Most of those still looking for jobs are students who graduated
from specialized schools, including 1,100 who studied on a
two-year basis.
</P>
<P>
According to the municipal personnel bureau, Shanghai, also the
country's largest manufacturing and business center, is in need of
some 60,000 college graduates annually over the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
In the next 15 years, the city will have a heavy demand for
graduates specializing in computer software, electronics
engineering, and telecommunications engineering.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Philippines Ready for APEC Meetings (part 1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 (by Ning Shuyong)
</P>
<P>
MANILA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- With only several days away
from the fourth informal leadership conference of the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, the Philippines declared that
it is ready for the biggest event in the country's recent history.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the success of the APEC meetings to be held in the
country from November 19 to 25, the Philippines has been working
hard for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
After being awarded the honor to host this year's APEC forum,
the Philippine government immediately set up the APEC National
Organizing Commission under the direct leadership of President
Fidel Ramos and Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon.)
</P>
<P>
The commission was further divided into 12 sub-committees
headed by the secretaries of 12 different government departments),
such as the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of
Public Works and Highways, the Department of Health and the Press
Secretary Office.
</P>
<P>
In order to show a beautiful Philippines to some 6,000
delegates and media staffs coming to the country, the APEC
National Organizing Commission has been engaged in beautifying
Manila and Subic. In the past two years, it refurbished the
Philippine International Convention Center (PICC), widened the
Roxas Boulevard where the PICC is located, renovated the country's
five international airports and constructed 21 leaders' villas in
Subic.
</P>
<P>
The PICC will be the venue of the Eighth APEC Economic
Ministerial Meeting on November 22-23. President Ramos will also
host a dinner there for the other 17 APEC leaders and their senior
officials on November 24.

<TEXT>
<P>
To facilitate some 3,000 correspondents' reporting of the
meetings, the Philippine 1996 APEC News Bureau established two
media centers in Manila, one is for wire services and newspapers
while the other for broadcasting and TV stations. The bureau also
set up another media center in Subic for the one-day informal
leadership conference on November 25.
</P>
<P>
Major players in the Philippine telecommunications industry
also promised to provide some 6,000 telephone lines for APEC
delegates and journalists, 3,000 of them are international direct
dial (IDD) lines installed in Manila and the rest are cellular
phones in Subic.
</P>
<P>
To ease the usual traffic jam, Manila traffic department has
marked some lanes on the six major roads in the city for the
exclusive use of vehicles with APEC Passes. An expressway was also
built between Subic and Manila, reducing the travel time between
the two places by some 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Security was tight in the three previous APEC meetings held in
the United States, Indonesia and Japan. This year will be no
different. The Philippines gave top priority to Security in
preparing for the APEC meetings. It was reported that one-fourth
of the country's total appropriation of 378 million pesos (14.77
million U.S. dollars) for the APEC forum has been spent on
security.
</P>
<P>
In face of the threats to disrupt the APEC meetings by
terrorists groups, the Philippine military and police have
mobilized some 2,000 well-trained men and women to provide
close-in security for 18 APEC leaders while thousands of troops
are deployed in Manila and Subic. Subic was also declared as a
non-fly zone except for planes carrying the leaders and their
senior officials.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, the Philippine security forces and APEC medical
teams held a dress rehearsal, simulating the arrival and departure
of the 17 leaders at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport and
their activities at the PICC. As an added measure, Ramos also
announced recently that APEC leaders can bring their own security
personnel and bomb-sniffing dogs to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
With his country fully prepared for the upcoming APEC event,
Ramos voiced confidence that the big conference of world leaders
to be hosted by his country "will be a success".
</P>
<P>
"We can assure all APEC delegations whether government or from
the private sector -- from the level of businessmen all the way up
to the leaders -- of complete safety, comfort, hospitality and a
harmonious kind of environment for their stays in the
Philippines," the President said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Landlocked Inner-Mongolia is
closer to the sea as a result of accelerated railway and highway
construction across the region's grasslands.
</P>
<P>
The 943-kilometer-long Jitong Railway, which is the longest
locally-financed railway in China, and which went into operation
last December, connects the grassland autonomous region with
several railway trunk lines and finally leads it to the sea in
Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
A new 268-kilometer electrified rail which links Jungar in
Inner-Mongolia with Datong, a coal city in neighboring Shanxi
Province, was connected in July to the Datong-Qinhuangdao Railway,
giving another sea outlet to the region.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1990s new railways stretching for 1,300 kilometers
have been brought into operation in Inner-Mongolia. Hohhot Railway
Bureau has invested 3.25 billion yuan (391 million US dollars) in
new rail construction and the upgrading of old railways.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a highway network has also been expanding in the
grassland region.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, the region has poured about three
billion yuan into the building of new highways totalling 1,479
kilometers.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning's New Way to Attract Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning Province, an old
industrial base in northeast China, is to encourage well-run
industrial firms to seek listing on overseas and domestic stock
exchanges in the next couple of years, the provincial governor Wen
Shizhen has announced.
</P>
<P>
Anshan and Benxi Iron and Steel works, Panjin Ethylene
Industrial Company, Dalian Petro-chemical Company, and
Shenyang-Dalian Expressway Company are already making preparations
for listing of their shares both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The move is one of five new measures worked out by the
provincial government to attract more foreign funds to the area.
</P>
<P>
Other measures include transfer of shares and management
powers, trial of BOT (build-operate-transfer), and the use of more
foreign loans and direct investment.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, Liaoning has utilized over 7.4 billion US dollars
of foreign funds, 60 percent of which was foreign direct
investments. In the first five months of this year, foreign
investment used in the province amounted to 2.83 billion US
dollars. Principal overseas investors included Hong Kong, Macao,
Japan, the United States, the Republic of Korea, and Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> House Speaker Looks forward to "Implementation Congress" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Some six dozen new members
awaiting the start of the 105th Congress were attending
orientation sessions on running a congressional office here this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Most of them already have some government experience, and that
will help everyone focus less on partisan maneuvering and more on
reaching agreement and getting things done, House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, a Republican of Georgia, said.
</P>
<P>
"If the last Congress goes down in history as the confrontation
Congress, then this Congress may go down as the implementation
Congress," Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
"Having met now with freshmen of both parties, I think this is
going to be a very effective class," he said. "They all come out
of a background of practical experience and practical legislative
skills, whether in city government or in state legislatures."
</P>
<P>
House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt, a Democrat from
Missouri, said Democratic freshmen have told him they want to
avoid the partisan rancor that characterized debate in the 104th
Congress.
</P>
<P>
"They all tell me that they want to work in a bipartisan
manner. They want really try to reach across the aisle to the
other side, and I suspect the Republicans feel the same," Gephardt
said.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday's agenda were tips on hiring staff, sticking to
office budgets, using computers and advice on steering clear of
ethical problems, said Bill Pierce, a spokesman on the House
Oversight Committee, the panel that runs freshman orientation
sessions every two years.
</P>
<P>
Republicans still hold the majority of seats, though by a
smaller margin now, in the House, Gephardt said. He expected that
to help soften the rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
"We've got a closer number numerically. No one has a lopsided
margin. And, if we're going to get things done, it's imperative
that we work together," said Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
"Now there really is common ground," Gingrich said. "If both
sides are saying, `Let's get to a balanced budget,' why would you
fight?"

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, capital of south
China's Guangdong Province, is to hold a real estate exhibition
next month in cooperation with Hong Kong Real Estate Association.
</P>
<P>
The event is designed to bring in more foreign funds, and to
reduce money locked up in newly-built vacant flats.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, flats with a combined floor space
of 10 million square meters still remain vacant in Guangdong,
while construction of flats with a floor space of 60 million sq m
is underway.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that by the end of this year, the floor space
of houses still waiting for sale will be 20 million sq m in the
province, causing a serious stockpiling problem in the city's real
estate development funds.
</P>
<P>
The central government has adjusted real estate policies, and
has listed development and construction of houses as an economic
growth outlet for starting up sluggish real estate markets. With
the work for lowering taxes being carried out swiftly, more urban
residents will buy up their own houses.
</P>
<P>
Programs for the exhibition will include tracts of land with
approval from relevant government departments for leasing,
development zones with sound basic facilities, land for transfer
from debt-ridden enterprises, transfer of large properties, as
well as exchange of properties between Hong Kong and Guangzhou.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serbs Need Urgent Fund to Repair 100,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 16 (Xinhua) -- About 100,000 houses and
flats were demolished in Bosnia's Serb entity Republika Srpska
during the four years of civil war, Director of the Serb Housing
Department Jovo Basic said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference in Banja Luka, the biggest town
in the Republika Srpska, Basic said that, without foreign
assistance, the reconstruction of housing facilities would not be
possible in the next few decades, because the Republika Srpska had
been financially exhausted.
</P>
<P>
Basic said housing facilities in the Serb cities of
Mrkonjic-grad, Sipovo and Ribnik in central Bosnia were being
reconstructed by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
which would invest about 5 million U.S. dollars in the
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
"This is the largest foreign financial assistance offered to
the Republika Srpska individually so far," Tanjug news agency
quoted Basic as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Serb official noted that foreign funds used to reconstruct
flats in the Muslim-Croat federation, the other entity in Bosnia,
were 10 times more than in Serb republic, but he said
significantly higher investments to the Serb territory by the
World Bank were expected in the next building season.
</P>
<P>
According to foreign pledges to date, these investments should
amount to 180 million dollars, Basic said.
</P>
<P>
About 420,000 refugees and displaced persons have found shelter
in the Republika Srpska and 105,000 flats are needed to accommodate
these refugees, according to the Serb housing department.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon to Build 3000 New Fighters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Perry announced today that it has selected Lockheed Martin
Corp. and Boeing Co. to compete to build 3,000 new fighter jets
for the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The radar-avoiding "stealth" jet is the biggest arms project of
the early 21st century and would provide a common attack jet with
variations for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps and the
British Royal Navy.
</P>
<P>
Lockheed and Boeing will now build competing test models for a
final selection in 2001. The first jets are now scheduled for
delivery in 2008.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said it was awarding Lockheed a contract of 718.8
million U.S. dollars and Boeing contract of 661.8 million U.S.
dollars to immediately begin work on their demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
"Compared to current airplanes it brings a more lethal package
into the theater and does it faster," said Perry, who stressed
that air dominance is now a crucial factor in battle drawing the
experience in the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon plans to buy 2,978 joint strike fighters between
2005 and 2030, including 2,036 for the U.S. Air Force, 642 for the
Marine Corps and 300 for the Navy.
</P>
<P>
The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the cost
would be as much as 219 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the British Royal Navy plans to build 60 of the
jets.
</P>
<P>
The Marine and the British versions of the fighter would
have vertical landing and takeoff ability.
